         Mary Ingraham Bunting-Smith, the Radcliffe president who sought ways to help educated women carve out careers in a society not yet transformed by the feminist movement and became a mentor to several female writers, performers and scholars, died on Wednesday at Kendal at Hanover, a continuing care community in New Hampshire. She was 87.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith, a microbiologist who was Radcliffe president from 1959 to 1972, was called Polly from childhood and added Smith to her name after her second marriage,  in 1979.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith, who was also known for overseeing the fuller integration of Radcliffe College into Harvard, founded the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study -- now the Bunting Institute -- to help women who were scholars, writers, artists and scientists return to careers interrupted by family obligations.         ''Polly Bunting was always ahead of her time in anticipating the needs of women and of Radcliffe College,'' said Derek Bok, president emeritus of Harvard and a professor there. ''The idea of the Radcliffe Institute seems so obvious now. But the idea that there would be women who wanted to come back was a new idea then, and she saw that and created an institution that made it possible.''         Mrs. Bunting-Smith was also the first female member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the President's Committee on the Status of Women and a vice president of the Peace Corps.         Underused women and interrupted careers were a theme for Mrs. Bunting-Smith. She chided society for its ''waste of highly talented, educated womenpower,'' as she put it in a 1961 article she wrote for The New York Times Magazine, calling it a ''prodigious national extravagance.''         A soft-spoken woman who herself had worked part time while her children were young, she devoted her life to fighting that waste, to raising expectations among and about women and to creating opportunities for them.         As she saw it, two ''hidden dissuaders'' lowered the professional expectations of women: a system of higher education that, first, ignored real differences between male and female patterns of life and, second, did not provide for women who wanted to keep working part time in their fields while raising families. She established the Radcliffe Institute specifically to give scholarships to women cut off from careers by marriage.         To see a model of an active, engaged woman, Mrs. Bunting-Smith had only to look within her own family. Born in Brooklyn in 1910, she was one of four children of Mary Shotwell Ingraham, who was president of both the Brooklyn Young Women's Christian Association and the Y.W.C.A.'s national board. Her mother was also  a member of the New York City Board of Higher Education who helped plan the creation of the City University. Her father was Henry A. Ingraham, a lawyer and one of the founders of Long Island College of Medicine.         In her early years, Polly Bunting loved being outside. Although an avid reader, she did not go to school regularly until high school, because of her uncertain health. And she did not enjoy school. ''I was glad to get rid of it in the afternoon and get back to something interesting,'' she once said.         A growing interest in the sciences drew her into academia. She majored in physics at Vassar College, her mother's alma mater. At the University of Wisconsin, she studied agricultural bacteriology, earning a master's degree and a doctorate and meeting her husband, Henry Bunting, a medical student who shared her interest in hiking and bird watching. During his medical residency, she taught at Bennington College in Vermont. They married in 1937 and moved to Connecticut, where he was on the faculty of Yale University and she conducted research, working on the effects of radiation on bacteria.         While her four children were young, she spent more time at home, in Bethany, Conn. But even with young children, Mrs. Bunting-Smith was a 4-H leader, served on the library and school boards and was one of the organizers and directors of the Public Health Nursing Association.         When her husband died of a brain tumor in 1954, however, Mrs. Bunting-Smith was forced to look for a full-time job. Because she was a woman, there were no faculty openings at Yale, her son Charles recalled yesterday, and she jumped at the offer to become dean of Douglass College, the women's college of Rutgers University. She was a professor in the department of bacteriology there and an honorary professor at the Rutgers Institute of Microbiology.         At Douglass, she introduced a multilingual course in world poetry run by the students, as well as a program of part-time study for married women.         Five years later, at age 48, she was offered a job as the fifth president of Radcliffe College, the undergraduate college for women at Harvard University, with about 1,775 women.         She liked talking to students and kept an open door. She taught a freshman seminar. In meetings with students, she would sometimes kick off her shoes and invite her guests to do the same, and to join her on the floor. She also liked to chat with students who dropped by her Brattle Street house, and she would turn on her porch light on to signal that she was in.         Such access did not protect her from student protest. In the late 1960's, 20 black students sat in the Radcliffe administration offices seeking increased minority enrollment. Mrs. Bunting-Smith, who was at a conference in North Carolina, flew back to meet with the protesters and promised to act on their complaints. She faced other protests during the Vietnam War.         Another source of dissension was her work to merge Radcliffe more completely into Harvard. Radcliffe students already took classes with Harvard students, but they were admitted to college separately and had their own living quarters, administration and trustees. Mrs. Bunting-Smith thought the system inequitable and worked to integrate the campuses more fully, even though it ultimately reduced the role of the Radcliffe president.         But she may be best remembered for the establishment of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, which opened in 1961 with the help of $150,000 from the Carnegie Foundation and other grants. Its purpose was to pursue research into the psychological and cultural factors that affected women's status in society, and also to support female artists, scientists and scholars, particularly those who had suspended their careers because of family responsibilities.         In its first year the institute gave 20 women scholarships of up to $3,000 each, space to do their work and access to Radcliffe and Harvard services.         The poet Maxine Kumin, a member of that first group of scholars, remembers her two years at the institute as an ''amazing'' experience, with a diverse group of artists, scientists, social scientists and poets, ''with Polly Bunting as our ringmaster.''         Ms. Kumin said that at a time when she was teaching English composition to physical education majors at Tufts University because only men were allowed to teach liberal arts majors, ''being chosen as a Radcliffe scholar put an imprimatur on what you were doing and gave it legitimacy.''         Since that first class of scholars, more than 1,200 women have been given fellowships at the institute, including the author Alice Walker, the psychologist Carol Gilligan; former Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont; the poets Anne Sexton and Sophie Cabot Black; the performance artist Anna Deavere Smith; the anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, and the geophysicist and astronaut Marcia McNutt.         After Mrs. Bunting-Smith stepped down as president of Radcliffe in 1972, she spent three years as special assistant to the president of Princeton University, William Bowen, working on coeducation there.         In 1979, she married Dr. Clement A. Smith, a pediatrician and faculty member at Harvard. He died in 1988.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith is survived by three sons, Charles I. Bunting of Shelbourne, Vt., William H. Bunting of North Whitefield, Me., and John E. Bunting of New Boston, N.H.; a daughter, Mary B. Decher of Bellevue, Wash; three stepdaughters,  Pamela Smith of Harvard, Me., Gail Smith Biggar of Concord, Mass., and Hilary Smith of Peacham, Vt.; a stepson, Reynolds Smith of Harvard, Me.; a sister, Winifred I. Warner of Laurel Hollow, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Gertrude Scharff Goldhaber, a physicist who contributed to scientists' understanding of nuclear fission and the structure of atomic nuclei, died on Monday at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in Patchogue, N.Y. She was 86 and lived at Bayport on Long Island.         Dr. Goldhaber was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and retired as a senior scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.         She was credited with the discovery that spontaneous fission is associated with the emission of neutrons. She made that observation in 1942 when she was a research physicist at the University of Illinois, but it was classified top secret and not announced until after World War II.         Dr. Goldhaber added to the knowledge of the structure of the nucleus when she found regularities in nuclear excited states. She also worked in areas that included long-lived isomers (different versions of elements) and heavy ions (positively and negatively charged atoms or molecules).         In 1948, she and her husband, Dr. Maurice Goldhaber, determined that  beta rays were identical with electrons, which settled an argument among their peers.         She was elected a fellow of the American Physics Society in 1947 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1980, and to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1972.         Born in Mannheim, Germany, she earned a doctoral degree at the University of Munich in 1935 and moved to England to do research at Imperial College in London.         She did research and taught at the University of Illinois from 1939 to 1950, when she became the first woman with a Ph.D. in physics on the Brookhaven faculty.         Dr. Goldhaber founded the Brookhaven Lecture Series in 1960. She was a co-founder of Brookhaven Women in Science, which furthers the advancement of women scientists and began in 1979. She retired from Brookhaven in 1977 but returned in 1985 as a research collaborator, an association she continued until 1990.         Over the years, she was an adjunct professor at Cornell University and the Johns Hopkins University. She also was an adviser and consultant  at the National Research Council, the National Science Foundation and many other scientific bodies.         Besides her husband of 59 years, she is survived by two sons, both theoretical physicists, Dr. Alfred Goldhaber of Setauket, N.Y., and Dr. Michael Goldhaber of Oakland, Calif.; a sister, Liselotte Leoni of Nice, France, and two grandchildren.         In 1984, the Phi Beta Kappa society selected her as a Visiting Scholar, an honor that sent her to eight campuses for the year. In an interview at the time with The New York Times, she said that her path into science had been clear because she fell in love with numbers at the age of 4 and decided to study physics and mathematics as a teen-ager in Munich.         She declined to settle for the future of a high school teacher, as other  girls with similar interests might have, or a lawyer, as her father wanted, she said.         ''I said, 'I'm not interested in the law,' '' she recalled. ''I wanted to understand what the world is made of. That actually turned out to be a good thing because when the Nazis came -- I'm Jewish -- I had to leave the country, and physics was something that could be done anywhere.''       
         Martha Ellis Gellhorn, who as one of the first female war correspondents covered a dozen major conflicts in a writing career spanning more than six decades, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 89.         Ms. Gellhorn was a cocky, raspy-voiced maverick who saw herself as a champion of ordinary people trapped in conflicts created by the rich and powerful. That she was  known to many largely because of  her marriage to Ernest Hemingway, from 1940 to 1945, caused her unending irritation, especially when critics tried to find parallels between her lean writing style and that of her more celebrated husband.         ''Why should I be a footnote to somebody else's life?'' she bitterly asked in an interview, pointing out that she had written two novels before meeting Hemingway and continued writing for almost a half-century after leaving him.         As a journalist, Ms. Gellhorn had no use for the notion of objectivity. The chief point of going to cover anything, she felt, was so you could tell what you saw, contradict the lies and let the bad guys have it.         ''You go into a hospital, and it's full of wounded kids,'' she once said. ''So you write what you see and how it is. You don't say there's 37 wounded children in this hospital, but maybe there's 38 wounded children on the other side. You write what you see.''         Though best known for her groundbreaking journalism, Ms. Gellhorn was also an accomplished fiction writer, author of 5 novels, 14 novellas and 2 collections of short stories, many of which were based on people and incidents she encountered during her prodigious travels.         Fresh out of Bryn Mawr College in 1927, she began writing for The New Republic, then became a crime reporter for a local newspaper in Albany. Ms. Gellhorn got to Europe by writing a brochure for the Holland American Line and traveled throughout the continent. Later, she met Harry Hopkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's confidant, and talked her way into a job with the New Deal, wandering America and writing about the effects of the Depression on ordinary people.         She went to Spain in 1937 with nothing but a knapsack and $50, covered the conflict for Collier's Weekly and became Hemingway's lover.         ''In Barcelona, it was perfect bombing weather,'' she wrote in a typical dispatch in 1938. ''The cafes along the Ramblas were crowded. There was nothing much to drink; a sweet fizzy poison called orangeade and a horrible liquid supposed to be sherry. There was, of course, nothing to eat. Everyone was out enjoying the cold afternoon sunlight. No bombers had come over for at least two hours.''         She covered the blitz in London. On D-Day, she stowed away on a hospital ship and snuck ashore as a stretcher bearer. She got British pilots to let her ride along on night bombing raids over Germany. When the Allies liberated Dachau, she was there to write about it.         ''Behind the barbed wire and the electric fence,'' she wrote of her visit to Dachau, ''the skeletons sat in the sun and searched themselves for lice. They have no age and no faces; they all look alike and like nothing you will ever see if you are lucky.''         She covered Russia's war against Finland in 1939, trekked across China with Hemingway in 1940, and became increasingly critical of the United States, which she saw as a ''colonial power,'' eventually settling abroad for good. She covered Vietnam, Nicaraguan contras, the Arab-Israeli conflict and, at the age of 81, the United States invasion of Panama. It was only when war came to Bosnia that she gave it a pass.         ''Too old,'' she said. ''You have to be nimble for war.''         Ms. Gellhorn's war correspondence was collected in ''The Face of War'' in 1959. She always focused on ordinary foot soldiers and civilians, ignoring the generals. Her peacetime journalism was collected in ''The View From the Ground'' in 1988.         Among her novels were ''A Stricken Field'' (1940), set among refugees in Prague just before the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, and ''Liana'' (1944), about the marriage of a mulatto woman and a rich white man in the French Caribbean.         Many reviewers felt Ms. Gellhorn was even more successful as a writer of novellas, and she was highly praised for ''The Weather in Africa'' (1988), three novellas set on that continent, and ''The Novellas of Martha Gellhorn'' (1993).         Ms. Gellhorn sometimes took criticism from political conservatives, who painted her as a left-leaning dilettante whose writing was often didactic and sentimental. Others  criticized her vivid journalism as being, stylistically, too much like fiction and her terse fiction as being, stylistically, too much like journalism.         But her longevity and the compelling pull of her life story overrode such criticisms. A heroine to generations of young women correspondents for her fight to get equal treatment and a place on the front lines with male colleagues, she was also a romantic figure for her wartime relationship with one of the century's most famous writers and her subsequent rejection of him.         Ms. Gellhorn's father was a doctor in St. Louis with progressive notions and her mother, whom she adored, was a suffragist and social reformer who sometimes took her daughter  with her to rallies and protests.         Her father pulled her out of a convent school when he discovered the nuns were teaching female anatomy with a textbook that had its pictures covered and transferred the girl to a progressive coeducational school of which her mother was a co-founder.  Later, at Bryn Mawr, Ms. Gellhorn changed her major from English to French, which became useful for her  journalistic work in Europe. In 1934, she was among a group of American students invited to tour Nazi Germany, and she never forgot her first encounter with Fascism. When she returned to the United States and was working for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, she befriended Eleanor Roosevelt and spent some time, as the First Lady's guest, at the White House. She also wrote a collection of novellas about it, ''The Trouble I've Seen'' (1936).         Her first marriage, in 1933 to Bertrand de Jouvenel, a French pacifist who was the son-in-law of the novelist Colette, ended in divorce.         In 1936, she wandered into a bar in Key West, Fla., and met Hemingway. They drank, became friends and, the next year, when she showed up in Madrid, she picked up again with Hemingway and other war correspondents. She married the author in 1940, becoming his third wife.         They traveled and worked together, living between conflicts at a villa in Cuba. In 1945, Ms. Gellhorn left Hemingway, walking out after an argument at London's Dorchester Hotel. She was the only one of Hemingway's wives to leave him, and he never forgave her. ''His hatred of her was a terrible thing to see,'' one Hemingway biographer noted. She left, she said, because he was jealous and bullying.         Ms. Gellhorn's third marriage, to T. S. Matthews, an editor at Time magazine, also ended in divorce. She said she just found married life too boring.         After World War II, Ms. Gellhorn adopted a son in Italy and raised him, largely on her own, in Mexico and other countries, where she supported herself with a string of articles for women's magazines.         She is survived by her son, George Alexander Gellhorn of London, and a brother, Alfred Gellhorn of New York.         Ms. Gellhorn had decided that she could no longer live in the United States, and moved from Cuba to Italy to Mexico to Kenya until finally settling in Britain, where she spent her  last 15 years shuttling between a small cottage in Wales, an apartment in London and the world's trouble spots. Her South Kensington apartment became a kind of salon for writers and foreign correspondents.         Bill Buford, the fiction editor at The New Yorker who was previously the editor of Granta, an English literary magazine, wrote about Ms. Gellhorn and her work: ''Reading Martha Gellhorn for the first time is a staggering experience. She is not a travel writer or a journalist or a novelist. She is all of these, and one of the most eloquent witnesses of the 20th century.''         She also wrote a highly regarded travel book in 1979, ''Travels With Myself and Another,'' that was an often humorous recounting of some of her more uncomfortable jaunts to remote corners of the globe, some  with Hemingway, whom she referred to only as Unwilling Companion.         Her first love continued to be a crusading brand of nonfiction. ''Journalism is education for me,'' she wrote. ''Writing is payment for the chance to look and learn.''         She wrote on an old, battered typewriter and had to quit in 1992 when a cataract operation left her with diminished eyesight. She could no longer see the keys and felt she was too old to learn how to dictate.         But she never lost her bite. She chain-smoked, drank and ate what she pleased. ''It bores me, all that health stuff,'' she said. She told one woman who came to interview her late in life that she had to stop. ''This conversation is so boring I think I'm going to faint,'' she said.         Ms. Gellhorn had little use for most war reporting after the Vietnam War, saying that the press' role in ending that conflict had taught military leaders a lesson.         ''They realized the power of the press and have been controlling it ever since,'' she said. ''Look at the Gulf War. If you wanted to go out and say to a soldier, 'How is it, kid?,' you had to bring a minder so the kid says nothing.         ''It seems to me that they feed war reporters at these ridiculous briefings in the ballroom of hotels miles from anywhere.'' The public, she said, needs to realize that it is not getting the full story.         Looking back on a life that was colorful enough for any novel or reportage, Ms. Gellhorn once confessed: ''I'm overprivileged. I've had a wonderful life. I didn't deserve it but I've had it.''       
         Dr. Mary Catherine Raugust Howell, a pediatrician who championed medical careers and better health care for women and who was the first woman to become an associate dean at Harvard Medical School, died yesterday at her home in Watertown, Mass. She was 65.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Dr. Howell attracted the attention of a male-dominated establishment in 1973 with an ironically titled critique of the status quo, ''Why Would a Girl Go into Medicine? Medical Education in the United States: A Guide for Women'' (Feminist Press). Since Dr. Howell was a Harvard associate dean at the time, she decided to publish it under the pen name Margaret A. Campbell.         Her study of discrimination against women in medical schools, she declared in her foreword, was written ''to inform and encourage women medical students of the past, present and future and to promote radical change in medical education and in the care of patients.''         While quotas were not acknowledged in the admissions offices of medical schools, she wrote, practice suggested otherwise. A ''man doctor, woman nurse'' mentality reigned, she said, and with it the attitude that it was imprudent to waste expensive medical school training on a woman if she was unlikely to practice the profession because of marriage and  motherhood.         Dr. Howell acknowledged authorship of the book a few years later.  Her facts and figures were used as  ammunition by many groups pressing to gain a fairer role for women in the medical field. The prospects of women in medicine were eventually enhanced by Federal legislation against sex discrimination.         Dr. Howell was also active in the women's health movement. She was  a founding member of the National Women's Health Network, which was formed in the 1970's to lobby for better health care for women.         ''By 1975,'' said Cynthia Pearson, the network's executive director, ''there were over 2,000 community-based women's health groups that either provided direct services and education and an alternative to traditional male-dominated medical care or were engaged in efforts to change the system. Mary helped organize the first national women's health conference, which brought individual women and representatives of grass-roots women's health groups to the Harvard campus.''         Dr. Howell also contributed to Working Mother magazine and to ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' from the Boston Women's Book Collective, whose 25th anniversary update was published by Touchstone in 1996.         Mary Catherine Raugust was born on Sept. 2, 1932, in Grand Forks, N. D., the daughter of a businessman and a former public-school teacher. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1954, studied linguistics and originally wanted to become a musician. She married Robert Jordan of Weston, Conn., and had a son, Nicholas, but the marriage failed. She then decided to become a pediatrician.         ''She started to think she wanted to care for kids and went into pre-med,'' said Samuel Howell, her son by a second marriage. ''She was always very concerned about children and the institutional way in which medicine treats them. She fought against that all her life, trying to de-institutionalize medicine.''         In interviews later in her life, Dr. Howell told of the slights, condescension, jokes and outright hostility she endured as a medical student and intern from school administrators, faculty members and male students. Even female patients often feared that a female doctor was inherently inferior, Dr. Howell said.         But, persisting, she earned a Ph.D. in developmental psychology and an M.D. at the University of Minnesota in 1962; she earned a doctor of laws degree at Harvard University in 1991.         Dr. Howell trained in pediatrics, psychotherapy, bioethics and geriatrics at various institutions as she pursued her career as a practicing doctor and educator, starting as an instructor in child development at Minnesota in 1962. She joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School as an instructor in pediatrics in 1969, rising to become an assistant professor of pediatrics and chief of the behavior unit in the Children's Service of the Massachusetts General Hospital.         Dr. Howell was appointed associate dean for student affairs in 1972, becoming the highest-ranking woman at the medical school at the time, and served until 1975. She viewed her appointment as a kind of tokenism.         ''Prior to my appointment,'' she said in an interview in 1979, ''a committee of students and faculty had asserted the need for a woman administrator, and Harvard got tremendous mileage out of my appointment. Student affairs are traditionally places where your job is to keep students quiet and out of everyone's hair. The administration expected us to act as student pacifiers rather than student advocates.''         Shortly after her appointment, Dr. Howell sent out questionnaires to female medical students throughout  the country, asking them about their status and attitudes toward them. Their responses reminded her of her own painful journey to become a doctor, she said, and she decided to use them as the basis for what became her book for Feminist Press.         After leaving Harvard in 1975, she had a pediatric practice in York, Me.,  for a year. Based on her experiences there, she wrote another book, ''Healing at Home: A Guide to Health Care for Children'' (Beacon Press, 1978) She returned to the Boston area to practice pediatrics and psychotherapy.         From 1992 to 1994, she was a member of the Division of Medical Ethics at Harvard Medical School.         Dr. Howell's second marriage, to Dr. A. Ervin Howell of Fairmont, Minn., ended in divorce.         In addition to her sons Nicholas Jordan, of Weston, Conn., and Samuel Howell, of Manhattan, she is survived by three other sons, Aaron Howell, of Medford, Mass., Eli Howell, of Eugene, Ore., and Ned Raugust, of Concord, Mass.; two daughters, Sarah Howell, of Framingham, Mass., and Eve Howell, of Boston; a brother, Tony Raugust of Minneapolis, and one granddaughter.       
         Jean Blackwell Hutson, who as curator and then chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture helped make it the world's main public repository of materials on people of African descent, died on  Wednesday at Harlem Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Harlem.         From 1948, when the Schomburg Center was known as the Schomburg Collection, until 1980, when she retired as its chief, Mrs. Hutson harnessed her powerful will to assemble an archive of documents, books and works of art that reflected the experience not just of African-Americans, but of peoples throughout the African diaspora.         Under her supervision, the library grew to 75,000 volumes from 15,000 volumes. She assembled an important collection of historical material from Haiti, as well as of African art, and persuaded her childhood friend, Langston Hughes, to donate a portion of his papers to the center. A friend of Romare Bearden, Dorothy West, Richard Wright, W. E. B. DuBois and other figures of the Harlem Renaissance, Mrs. Hutson helped make the Schomburg the cultural center of Harlem.         Even when people, both black and white, during the integrationist movement of the 1940's and early 50's, questioned the need for a separate archive devoted entirely to black experience, Mrs. Hutson championed it. And in the years when the Schomburg's budget was faltering, she fought for financing, and lobbied the State Legislature for money.         ''She had an exacting personality,'' said Howard Dodson, the present chief of the Schomburg. ''She ran a tight ship and had an astute way of getting what she wanted done.  Once her mind was set on doing something, there was no stopping her.''         She was born in 1914 in Sommerfield, Fla., where her father, Paul O. Blackwell, was in business as a  farmer. Her mother, Sarah Myers  Blackwell, was an elementary school teacher. When she was 4, she and her mother moved to Baltimore while her father remained in Florida to run his business, commuting back and forth to Baltimore to visit his family.         Through her baby sitter, who ran a boarding house, she met the poet Langston Hughes. Hughes was then a student at Lincoln University in Oxford, Pa., and went to Baltimore on weekends. Their friendship endured. Throughout his life he referred to her as his ''baby sister,'' and when Mrs. Hutson came to Harlem as a young woman, Hughes made sure she met the leading writers and artists.         At 15, Mrs. Hutson was class valedictorian at her graduation from Douglass High School in Baltimore, then an all-black high school in a segregated system. The school had exacting standards and emphasized the study of black history and literature. One of her teachers was Yolande Du Bois, the daughter of W. E. B. DuBois.         She attended the University of Michigan, then switched to Barnard College. In 1935, she became the second black woman to graduate from Barnard; the first was Zora Neale Hurston.         Mrs. Hutson wanted to be a psychiatrist but took up library science with the goal of financing medical studies. In 1936 she received a master's degree from the Columbia University School of Library Service.         Her first job was in the New York City Public Branch Library system. As a librarian in the Bronx, Mrs. Hutson noticed that there were few Spanish-language books that would appeal to the borough's Spanish population, and she arranged to buy some. In 1939, she married Andy Razaf, a lyricist who wrote songs for Fats Waller. The marriage ended in divorce eight years later.         In 1950 she married John Hutson, a fellow employee at the Countee Cullen branch library. Mr. Hutson died in 1957. They had one daughter, Jean Frances, who died in 1992. Mrs. Hutson left no survivors.         In 1948, Mrs. Hutson was asked to take over the Schomburg, which was based on the private library of Arthur Alphonzo Schomburg, a Puerto Rican of African descent. ''I was drafted for six months to keep the Negroes quiet,'' Mrs. Hutson once said. ''People who grew up in the Depression didn't throw away jobs, so I came.''         With the rise of the black power movement and the success of independence movements in Africa and the Caribbean, interest in the Schomburg grew. In 1962, under her supervision, the library published the Dictionary Catalogue of the Schomburg Collection, which was put on microfilm and made its holdings known to libraries in Europe, Africa and the Americas.         Mrs. Hutson's work in developing the Schomburg caught the attention of President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, who asked her help in building an Africana collection at the University of Ghana. She lived in Ghana in 1964.         During the 1960's and 70's, the situation at the Schomburg grew perilous, with its collections deteriorating in the Countee Cullen branch library, a sparsely furnished, poorly lighted  space without air-conditioning at 103 West 135th Street. In 1971, Mrs. Hutson helped establish the Schomburg Corporation to raise money for a new building.         She ''learned to go to Albany,'' as she said once in an interview. There were many politicians, Mrs. Hutson said, ''who had never seen a black woman up in front of them at the legislature.'' Eventually she helped obtain a Federal grant for the construction of a new building.         In 1981, the new $3.7 million center finally opened, five stories tall, built of red brick and glass, climate-controlled, with an art gallery. By then, Mrs. Hutson had retired as the Schomburg's chief, and had taken a job in the office of library administration at the Public Library's headquarters on 42d Street.         Today, the Schomburg Collection holds some 150,000 volumes, 3.5 million manuscripts, the largest assemblage of photographs in the world documenting black life, and precious artifacts including a 16th-century manuscript, ''Ad Catholicum,'' by Juan Latino, believed to be the first book written by a black man.       
         Irene Kampen, who saw her sometimes strife-torn life as such a sitcom that it took Lucille Ball to portray it on television, died on Monday in Oceanside, Calif. She was 75 and the author of the book that inspired ''The Lucy Show.''         Her family said the cause was breast cancer.         Mrs. Kampen may not have been a born humorist, but she got a good start. Her father, Jack Trepel, a Rockefeller Center florist, was an accomplished magician with the gift of patter, and to hear Mrs. Kampen tell it, her mother, Mary, always had something funny to say and never held her tongue.         By the time she got to the University of Wisconsin, Mrs. Kampen, who was born in Brooklyn and later lived in Great Neck, N.Y., was funny enough to become editor of the campus humor magazine.         After graduating in 1943 with a degree in journalism, she worked as a copy girl at the old New York Journal-American. A child of her era, she wanted to be a conventional housewife and mother, and for a while she got her wish.         After her marriage to Owen Kampen, an artist and illustrator whom she had met in college, the couple settled in Levittown, on Long Island, where Mrs. Kampen kept house, took care of her young daughter, and, in a concession to her training, contributed society columns to the weekly Levittown Tribune.         In 1954, to be closer to Mrs. Kampen's parents, the couple built a house in Ridgefield, Conn., and might have settled into an idyllic New England life if Mr. Kampen hadn't had an affair with the architect's wife.  The resulting divorce was as bitter as any, but Mrs. Kampen came through it with a sure-fire sense of the absurd.         It wasn't easy being a divorced mother in a tiny New England town in the 1950's. Mrs. Kampen took in another struggling divorced mother to help make ends meet.         But for all the economic hardship and social stigma, she not only made the best of it; she also took notes.  And when she turned them into a book, ''Life Without George,'' in 1961, she had a new career.         Her timing was close to perfect. The book came out just as Lucille Ball, whose divorce from Desi Arnaz had undercut the premise of her famous ''I Love Lucy'' television series, was casting around for a new format as a working mother. ''Life Without George'' fit the bill.         The success of the book and of the television series, which ran from 1962 to 1968, helped persuade Mrs. Kampen to continue mining her life for comedy. Although she had barely mentioned her husband in ''Life Without George,'' she tried her hand at serious, cathartic fiction with ''We That Are Left,'' a thinly disguised 1961 account of her marriage.         For the 1965 ''Europe Without George,'' she returned to humor with a vengeance.         Taking no chances during a summer research vacation, she ordered her college-age daughter to go out and have fun and adventures in every city they visited.         Her daughter chafed a bit, but provided enough good subject matter that for a while she became a virtual subsidiary of the family enterprise. When she and her boyfriend wanted to go skiing, for example, her mother insisted on going along, not simply as a chaperone but because she wanted to take notes. Mrs. Kampen recounted the adventure in ''Last Year at Sugarbush'' (1965).         Similarly, her daughter's wedding became ''Here Comes the Bride, There Goes the Mother'' (1967), and while Mrs. Kampen did not accompany the couple on their honeymoon, she was right there when they went to graduate school at the University of Wisconsin, turning out ''Due to Lack of Interest, Tomorrow Has Been Canceled,'' the story of a 45-year-old divorced woman who returns to college in the hippie era.         Mrs. Kampen, whose other books include ''Are You Carrying Any Gold or Living Relatives?,'' a 1970 account of a trip to the Soviet Union, also wrote widely for magazines, turned out self-deprecating columns about her life for local newspapers and talked her way repeatedly around the world as a cruise-ship lecturer.         As she got older, the travails of aging provided a fount of material.         In addition to her daughter, Christine Gutherie of San Francisco, Mrs. Kampen is survived by her companion, Louis Ferioli, and a sister, Joyce Miller of Washington.       
         Bella S. Abzug, New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist, politician and lawyer, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77.         She died of complications following heart surgery, said Harold Holzer, who was her spokesman when she served in Congress. She had been hospitalized for weeks, and had been in poor health for several years, he said.         Ms. Abzug represented the West Side of Manhattan for three Congressional terms in the 1970's. She  brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character. Often called just Bella, she was recognizable everywhere by her big hats and a voice that Norman Mailer said ''could boil the fat off a taxicab driver's neck.''         She opposed the Vietnam War, championed what was then called women's liberation and was one of the first to call for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. Long after it ceased to be fashionable, she called her politics radical. During her last campaign, for Congress in 1986, she told The New York Times, ''I am not a centrist.''         Bella Abzug was a founding feminist, and an enduring one. In the movement's giddy, sloganeering early days, Ms. Abzug was, like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, an icon, the hat bobbing before the cameras at marches and rallies.         After leaving the House in January 1977, she worked for women's rights for two more decades. She founded an international women's group that worked on environmental issues. And she was a leader of a conference of nongovernmental organizations that paralleled the United Nations' fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.         Even then, she continued to rankle.  Former President George Bush, on a private visit to China that coincided with the Beijing conference, said to a meeting of food production executives: ''I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around. Bella Abzug is one who has always represented the extremes of the women's movement.''         When told of Mr. Bush's remark, Ms. Abzug, 75 and in a wheelchair, retorted: ''He was addressing a fertilizer group? That's appropriate.''         Her forceful personality and direct manner made her a lightning rod for criticism from those who opposed the idea of holding a women's conference. After Bob Dole, then the Senate majority leader, said he could not imagine why anyone ''would want to attend a conference co-chaired by Bella Abzug,'' she responded that she was not running the meeting but simply participating with more than 30,000 other women over how best to achieve equal rights.         But much of what Ms. Abzug agitated for -- abortion rights, day care, laws against employment discrimination -- was by that time mainstream political fare.         In Congress, ''she was first on almost everything, on everything that ever mattered,'' said Esther Newberg, Ms. Abzug's first administrative assistant and one of many staff members who quit but remained devoted. ''She was first to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, first to call for an end to the war.''         Ms. Abzug made enemies easily -- ''Sometimes the hat and the mouth took over,'' Ms. Newberg said -- but Ms. Abzug saw that as a consequence of a refusal to compromise, as well as a matter of sport. Of her time in the House, Ms. Abzug wrote in a journal that was published in 1972 as ''Bella,'' ''I spend all day figuring out how to beat the machine and knock the crap out of the political power structure.''         She worked relentlessly at organizing and coalition-building. A founder of Women Strike for Peace and the National Women's Political Caucus, she spent a lifetime prodding for change, with a lawyer's enthusiasm for political channels, through organizations from the P.T.A. to the United Nations.         She made friends easily, too. ''She's fierce and intense and funny,'' said her longtime friend Gloria Steinem. ''She takes everyone seriously. When she argues with you fiercely, it's because she takes you seriously. And she's willing to change her mind. That's so rare.''         Her First Speech, In a Subway Station         Bella Savitzky Abzug was born on July 24, 1920 in the Bronx, the second daughter of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father, Emanuel Savitzky, whom Ms. Abzug later described as ''this humanist butcher,'' ran (and named) the Live and Let Live Meat Market on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan.         She said she knew from the age of 11 that she wanted to be a lawyer, and not long afterward gave her first public speech, in a subway station, while collecting for a Zionist youth organization. She went from Hunter College, where she was student body president, to Columbia University Law School, where she was an editor of The Law Review, to a practice representing union workers.         Ms. Abzug traced the wearing of her trademark wide-brimmed hats to those days. She once recalled: ''When I was a young lawyer, I would go to people's offices and they would always say: 'Sit here. We'll wait for the lawyer.' Working women wore hats. It was the only way they would take you seriously.         ''After a while, I started liking them. When I got to Congress, they made a big thing of it. So I was watching. Did they want me to wear it or not? They didn't want me to wear it, so I did.''         All the while, she was a leftist and an agitator. Later, exasperated with her Congressional aides, she wrote: ''I just don't understand young people today, quite frankly. Our struggle was political, ideological and economic, and we felt we couldn't make something of ourselves unless we bettered society. We saw the two together.''         In the 1950's, Ms. Abzug's law practice turned to other cases identified with the left. One client was Willie McGee, a black Mississippian convicted of raping a white woman and sentenced to death. Ms. Abzug, who was pregnant at the time, argued the case in Mississippi while white supremacist groups threatened her. Though the Supreme Court stayed the execution twice, Mr. McGee was eventually executed.         She also represented people accused of Communist activities by Senator Joseph McCarthy's Congressional committee and its counterpart in Albany.         In the 1960's, Ms. Abzug became an antiwar activist. A founder of Women Strike for Peace, she became its chief lobbyist, protesting nuclear testing and, later, the Vietnam War. She organized insurgent Democrats into other groups, too, becoming a leader of the movement against President Lyndon B. Johnson and a prominent figure in the 1968 Presidential campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy.         During those years, Ms. Abzug started navigating New York City politics. She and her husband, Martin, moved from Mount Vernon, the Westchester suburb where they had raised their two daughters, to a town house at 37 Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In 1970, Ms. Abzug ran for Congress.         The 19th Congressional District, which snaked from lower Manhattan  to the West 80's, had four registered Democrats to every Republican and had been represented in Congress for seven terms by Leonard Farbstein, a  solid but rather somnolent liberal. Ms. Abzug won the Democratic primary with 54 percent of the vote.         Campaign Became A Women's Crusade         At this point, Bella Abzug became national news, a flash of local color in a political year. She seemed to be everywhere, clapping backs and jabbing biceps. Her campaign headquarters next to the Lion's Head, a writers' and journalists' bar in Greenwich Village, was also a day-care center for her legions of female volunteers. The women's crusade she led brought considerable, if sometimes derisive, attention.         Though she eventually took 55 percent of the vote, she had genuine Republican opposition, unusual in an era when New York's main political action consisted of various Democratic factions knifing one another. The Republican-Liberal candidate was Barry Farber, a well-known radio talk show host. Mr. Farber drew many Democrats who resented Mr. Farbstein's humiliation or were simply put off by Ms. Abzug's style.         To her chagrin, Mr. Farber accused Ms. Abzug, who advocated direct negotiations between Israelis and Arabs, of flagging in her support of Israel. For years after that, she made a point of stating her Jewish credentials, dating to childhood: her family was religious and she went regularly to synagogue (though she was bothered that women were relegated to the back rows of the balcony), studied Hebrew and was enrolled for a time at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         When Ms. Abzug went to Washington, she sought an appointment to the Armed Services Committee. She wanted a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam and she vowed to take on the military-industrial complex. She wanted to end the draft. She wanted national health insurance, money for  day-care centers and housing, and more money for New York City, all to be paid for with billions siphoned from the Pentagon's budget.         She got little of this, but during the next six years ''she was indefatigable,'' Ms. Newberg recalled. ''She yelled a lot,only because she couldn't get everything done.'' And if she couldn't, Ms. Newberg added, it was partly because ''her agenda was too pure for her moment in time.''         Ms. Abzug did become expert at parliamentary rules, worked them skillfully and was famously well prepared for every vote, hearing and committee spat. The ''sunshine law'' requiring governing bodies to meet publicly came out of a subcommittee she headed. She coaxed funds for New York from the Public Works Committee. She was a co-sponsor of  the women's equal rights amendment. ''She was one of the most exciting, enlightened legislators that ever served in the Congress,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, with whom Ms. Abzug sometimes collaborated and sometimes sparred.         From her first day on Capitol Hill -- the day she dismayed her colleagues by introducing her Vietnam resolution -- Ms. Abzug derided the Congressional club, the seniority system, the log-rolling and back-scratching. She did not spare fellow Democrats; when she spoke of liberals, it was usually dismissively. She badgered the House leadership over committee appointments and votes.         She badgered the President, too. Invited to a reception at Richard Nixon's White House, she accepted (while writing in her journal, ''Who wants to listen to his pious idiocies?''), then announced to Nixon in the receiving line that her constituents demanded a withdrawal from Vietnam.         For all of her railing against Democrats who went along to get along,  Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill named her one of his dozen assistant whips, and by most accounts she worked well with some of the crustiest fixtures in the House.         Still, a 1972 report by Ralph Nader  estimated that Ms. Abzug's sponsorship of a measure often cost it 20 to 30 votes. Her reputation as an irritant came from all quarters. Jimmy Breslin wrote of a campaign worker who repaired to the Lion's Head one night, holding his side and swearing never to work for Ms. Abzug again. ''She punched me,'' he explained, in a quarrel over scheduling. The next day, Mr. Breslin reported, Ms. Abzug called the aide. ''Michael, I called to apologize,'' she said. ''How's your kidney?''         Mr. Breslin also recounted the Congresswoman's introduction to Sol Linowitz, the former chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a Democratic Party luminary: ''Are you the man that used to be head of the Xerox?'' Ms. Abzug asked. ''That's right,'' Mr. Linowitz replied. ''I'm glad to meet a big shot,'' Ms. Abzug said. ''I'm in hock $35,000 on my campaign.''         Ms. Abzug acknowledged loneliness in her years in Congress. ''Outside of Martin and the kids, I don't feel very related to most people at this point,'' she wrote in 1971. ''I feel detached in social situations. I'm always thinking about other things, about Congress, about the issues, about the political coalition I'm trying to organize. It never leaves me. I even have trouble relating to some of my closest friends, though God knows I still love them, even if they don't know it.''         Always, she returned to Manhattan to spend weekends with her husband.         She had married Martin Abzug in 1944. The two New Yorkers met on a bus in Miami, when both were on the way to a Yehudi Menuhin concert. Mr. Abzug, a stockbroker and an author of two published novels, had next to no interest in politics. In an interview in 1970, he murmured, while his wife was out of the room, ''The political bug is a curious bug.'' But he was, she said, her best friend and supporter, and ''one of the few unneurotic people left in society.''         Corrosive Ambition Hampers a Career         Ms. Abzug's own ambition was too corrosive for many people, even -- or, perhaps, especially -- for her fellow New York Democrats. When the State Legislature sliced up her district in 1972, they urged her to challenge one of the two conservative incumbent Democrats in adjoining districts, Representative John J. Rooney or Representative John M. Murphy. Instead, she opposed a liberal Democrat, William Fitts Ryan, in the 20th District, encompassing the Upper West Side and the Riverdale section of the Bronx.         The primary was bitter and, eventually, politically expensive to Ms. Abzug. Bill Ryan was one of the earliest heroes of the city's insurgent Democrats, an early opponent of the  Vietnam War and a genuinely well-liked man who, as many of his constituents knew, was waging a gallant fight against cancer.         Mr. Ryan defeated Ms. Abzug in the Democratic primary but died before the general election. The Democratic County Committee appointed Ms. Abzug as the candidate to replace him, but she was challenged by Mr. Ryan's widow, Priscilla, who ran on the Liberal line. Ms. Abzug won in November, but she had made dedicated enemies who believed she was an overly aggressive politician who would not hesitate to attack anyone who got in her way. Ten years later, she was denied a seat in the state's delegation to the national party's biannual conference because New York leaders considered her disruptive.         In 1976, she gave up her House seat to run for the Senate. She lost in the primary, to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, by a margin of only 1 percent. Two more campaigns quickly followed. (In a 1978 interview, she said: ''I'm a politician. I run for office. That's my profession.'') She lost to Edward I. Koch in a crowded mayoral primary in 1977. The next year, running for the House again, she lost, again by just 1 percent, to a little-known Republican, S. William Green.         She was appointed co-chairwoman  of President Jimmy Carter's National Advisory Committee on Women, and then, after disagreeing with him over economic policy, was dismissed. The majority of the committee members resigned in protest. Ms. Abzug, unapologetic, said with a shrug, ''I've got to find myself another big, nonpaying job.''         Her next and last campaign was in 1986, this time for a House seat in Westchester County. She won the primary in a burst of the old, ebullient campaigning style, but lost in November to Joseph J. DioGuardi, the Republican incumbent.         It was during that campaign that Martin Abzug died. Her friends said Ms. Abzug never recovered. Nine years later, she said, , ''I haven't been entirely the same since.''         There was one more bid for office, for her old House seat on the Upper West Side, when she announced her candidacy to replace Representative Ted Weiss on his death just before the 1992 election. But she was quickly eliminated from the field at the party convention.         During the next decade, Ms. Abzug suffered from ill health, including breast cancer, but continued to practice law and work for women's groups. She wrote a book, ''Gender Gap,'' with her old friend Mim Kelber. She started a lobbying group called Women U.S.A. and founded the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a group that works with international agencies.         In addition to her daughters, Eve and Liz, Ms. Abzug is survived by her sister, Helene Alexander of Great Neck, N.Y.         ''I've been described as a tough and noisy woman, a prizefighter, a man hater, you name it,'' Ms. Abzug said of herself in ''Bella.'' ''They call me Battling Bella, Mother Courage and a Jewish mother with more complaints than Portnoy.''         ''There are those who say I'm impatient, impetuous, uppity, rude, profane, brash and overbearing. Whether I'm any of these things or all of them, you can decide for yourself. But whatever I am -- and this ought to be made very clear at the outset -- I am a very serious woman.''       
         Baroness Lestor of Eccles, a crusading British politician who spoke out against apartheid in defiance of her Government's policies and who struck a blow on behalf of single mothers when she won the right to adopt two children on her own, died in a hospice in London on Friday. She was 66 and had been suffering from motor neurone disease.         Lady Lestor had two great causes in her life: the fight against racism and the fight for the rights of children, and was never afraid to criticize her party when she disagreed with its policies.         She was briefly chairman of the Labor Party in 1977-78 and served as a junior minister in several Labor Governments in the early 1970's, but was perhaps too uncompromising in her beliefs to rise to a higher office. She was, an admirer once said, ''the heart and soul of the Labor Party.''         Joan Lestor was born on Nov. 13, 1931, in Vancouver, British Columbia, to parents steeped in the international labor movement. Her mother, Esther, had been a machinist in a textile factory in East London who, as a teen-ager, became a shop steward for the garment workers' union; her father, Charles, a journalist and actor, was a leading member of the Canadian Socialist Party and later, when the family returned to England, of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.         Ms. Lestor graduated from London University with a diploma in sociology and went to work as a nursery school teacher, opening a nursery school in her own home six years later. At the same time she pursued a career in politics. Disillusioned by what she considered the extremism of her father's party, she joined Labor at the age of 24, won several local elections and was elected to Parliament in 1966. She remained there, with a four-year break, until 1997.         She immediately threw herself into the issues that consumed her, introducing a bill to tighten regulations on nursery schools and providers of child care; fighting the Government's attempt to stop paying social security benefits to unwed mothers, and working to insure that abandoned wives could obtain financial support from their husbands.         She was passionate about the rights of abused children, saying in a 1989 debate that while it was necessary to ''strike a balance'' between the rights of children and the rest of the family, ''in my book, the rights of the children are paramount.''         Her jobs in the Labor Governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan often became jeopardized by the rigor of her principles. In 1974, when she was appointed a junior minister in the Foreign Office with special responsibility for African affairs, she earned the nickname ''the African Queen'' and repeatedly clashed with her superiors over her strong anti-apartheid views.         Ms. Lestor was then moved to a ministerial job in the Education Department. But she resigned after a year in protest over spending cuts that threatened the jobs of thousands of teachers and forced the postponement of her goal to change the age when students left state-financed secondary schools to 16, from 15.         With the Conservatives in power through the 1980's and into the 1990's, Ms. Lestor worked as the opposition's chief spokeswoman on a number of issues, including children and the family, juvenile crime and race relations. She resigned from her last opposition post, as spokeswoman for overseas development, in 1996, saying that she was too ill to continue.         In 1997 she was made a Baroness and elevated to the House of Lords.         A flamboyant, warmhearted woman who listed her hobbies in Who's Who as ''playing with children and animals,'' Lady Lestor relished adversarial politics and was not shy about telling people what she thought, in the plainest possible language.         When she heard that Rupert Allason, a fellow Member of Parliament and an espionage expert, was about to accuse her publicly of spying for the K.G.B., she confronted him and showered him with invective. ''Perhaps I used words no lady should,'' she conceded later.         She was married briefly as a teen-ager in 1948, but the marriage was dissolved and she never remarried. She wanted children, nonetheless, and fought for the right to adopt them herself, despite being single.         When she won her case, she cried with happiness, and went on to adopt her son, David, in 1967, and her daughter, Susan, in 1969. She loved being a grandmother, and caused roars of laughter in Parliament when she announced, in a wicked nod at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who had grandly used the royal ''we'' in noting the birth of her first grandchild, that ''we too became a grandmother.''         When she received her peerage, she said she celebrated by baking muffins for her grandchildren; having them, she said, was ''even better than being in love.''       
         Kasey Cisyk, an opera-trained singer who never made it to the Met but whose haunting coloratura soprano became one of the world's most listened-to voices, died on March 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 44 and had been the singing voice of the long-running ''Have You Driven a Ford Lately?'' advertising campaign.         Her family said the cause was breast cancer.         In the capricious world of show business, she never enjoyed splashy success, but in the backwaters of her profession, where most singers, after all, spend their entire careers, Miss Cisyk, a tiny, slender woman with a smile as big as her heart, made her share of waves.         She worked as a backup singer for Carly Simon and Quincy Jones; she dubbed the Oscar-winning title song for the 1977 movie ''You Light Up My Life,'' and in the demanding world of commercial jingles, she was a star, one whose very anonymity was a critical asset.         It allowed her, for example, to amass a list of credits that included such archrivals as ABC, NBC and CBS; McDonald's and Burger King, American and Delta airlines and even Coke and Pepsi.         And for all her long run with Ford, Miss Cisyk also sang in the service of Chevrolet, Cadillac and Toyota.         It was her work for Ford that made her the envy of her colleagues. From the time she became the voice of Ford in 1981 until the campaign was finally retired two months ago, hers was the most ubiquitous voice in the land. In 1989, when the campaign was nearing the midpoint of its 17-year run, an industry record for a corporate soloist, Ford executives estimated that Miss Cisyk had been heard by a cumulative audience of 20 billion.         Maybe not what she had in mind when she was studying opera at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan, but not at all bad for a Queens-born daughter of a Ukrainian virtuoso who wanted her to play the violin.         Miss Cisyk, whose father maintained a studio on the Lower East Side, learned the instrument when she was 5 (she also studied ballet), and after graduating from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, she dutifully accepted a violin scholarship to Mannes.         By the time she graduated she had switched to classical voice training, won encouraging praise for roles in student opera productions, and sung  ''Rigoletto'' in Ghent on a New York State scholarship in Belgium.         For all her promise, Miss Cisyk, whose father died when she was 17, was drawn away from opera and into the world of jingles by the pressing need to make a living.         She found work singing in clubs in New York, but for a while in the mid-70's she despaired of breaking into the tight-knit world of commercials. For months after she had circulated tapes to advertising agencies she heard nothing.         Then the executives got around to listening to the tapes, and the calls started coming in, slowly at first, but after six months of sporadic work, an entire industry seemed to make the simultaneous discovery that her voice was money in the bank.         Suddenly she was in such demand that a typical day, she later recalled, would begin with a 9 A.M. session for Trans World Airlines, followed by Coca-Cola at 11, Hartz Mountain at 1 P.M., Eastern Airlines at 2, Datsun at 3, L'Eggs at 5, McDonald's at 6, and, after all that, a recording session from 8:30 P.M. to 3 A.M.         By the time Ford came calling in 1981, she had learned to pace herself.         After an early marriage and divorce, she married Edward J. Rakowicz, a recording engineer, had a son, Edward W., now 7, and became as devoted a mother as she had been a dedicated singer.         But even after her cancer was diagnosed in 1992 and she began the long, painful ordeal of therapy, Miss Cisyk, who is also survived by her older sister, Maria, a concert pianist and teacher who lives in Ridgefield, Conn., continued to work, singing her last professional jingle just a few months ago.         She may never have made it to the Met or even had a popular hit record in the United States, but she was not a complete unknown in the world of music.         Miss Cisyk, whose given name was Kvita (Ukrainian for flower), adopted the professional name Kasey from her initials, intending to reserve Kvita for an opera career that never happened. She eventually found a use for it after all.         A woman who cherished her Ukrainian heritage, Miss Cisyk formed her own production company in 1988 and recorded two C.D.'s, one  (''Kvita'') of Ukrainian folk songs, the other (''Kvita Two Colors'') of Ukrainian love songs.         Both have been wildly popular among the 100 million far-flung Ukrainian expatriates and in Ukraine, where the woman who worked in the backwaters of American show business was regarded as a leading performer and is very much a household name.       
         Cardiac patients who were lucky enough to make it to Houston in the days Michael E. Debakey and Denton E. Cooley were pioneering open heart surgery at Methodist Hospital were doubly fortunate that the nurse in charge of the operating room was Fannie Lou Spelce, a well-grounded, no-nonsense woman with a scalpel-sharp eye for detail and a spirited commitment to professional excellence.         Mrs. Spelce, who had to overcome considerable odds to make it to the pinnacle of her profession and who earned acclaim as a folk artist known as the Grandma Moses of Texas, died at her home in Austin on April 11. She was 89 years old.         A native of the little Ozarks town of Dwyer, Ark., and the first member of her farm family to attend college, Mrs. Spelce, who was born in 1908, completed four years of nursing training in Fort Smith, Ark., spent a high-kicking year in New York honing her skills at the city's leading hospitals, then returned to Arkansas to begin a troubled marriage and a hopscotching career working in a series of small-town and big city hospitals from Arkansas to California.         A single mother long before the term was coined, Mrs. Spelce often held two jobs, but still had so much trouble making ends meet she sometimes could not afford a babysitter for the night shift, so while living in California she put her two sons to bed in a car outside the Berkeley hospital rather than leave them home alone.         If Mrs. Spelce demonstrated some remarkable perseverance in dealing with the vagaries of modern life, the well-spring of her character eventually became manifest, so much so that when she died at her home in Austin, Mrs. Spelce was remembered less for her distinguished nursing career than as an acclaimed folk artist who had for 20 years turned out oil paintings of life on an Arkansas farm in such rich and vivid detail that it was apparent that her childhood had not been a distant memory but something she had carried with her close to the surface throughout her life.         Mrs. Spelce's remarkable talent led to a one-woman show in New York, her inclusion in a number of folk art anthologies and renown as the Grandma Moses of Texas.         Her emergence as an artist came about by accident. Leaving Dallas at the end of the 1950's to be near her sons, who had settled in Austin after graduation from the University of Texas, she took a job as a nurse at a private school, a position that gave her a year-round home in the school infirmary and left her with free time in the summer.         When a friend signed up for an oil painting class at a gallery and asked Mrs. Spelce to join her, she agreed, saying she had always wanted to draw.         The first day, according to family legend, when the teacher arranged a classic still life and told his students to go to work, Mrs. Spelce spent the first part of the class working in a tiny area at the center of the canvas until the teacher told her she was supposed to use the entire surface. Too ashamed to make a new start in public, Mrs. Spelce spent the rest of the class cleaning off her work, then took the canvas home, painted the still life from memory, took her work in the next day and sheepishly asked the teacher if that was what he had in mind.         The teacher was so thunderstruck by the painting and by his student's raw, unschooled talent that he blurted out that she was a primitive. ''I may be old,'' Mrs. Spelce retorted, ''but I'm not primitive.''         Encouraged to paint what she wanted, Mrs. Spelce drew on her childhood, sometimes using old photographs as a guide but mainly relying on her memory to create scores of paintings marked by painstakingly detailed foregrounds and shimmering, impressionistic backgrounds.         Her best known painting, ''The Quilting Bee,'' took a year to produce, partly because Mrs. Spelce, using a magnifying glass and a single-hair brush, painted the scene's window curtains thread by thread.         Folk art is rarely fashionable, but after a son took several of her paintings to New York, the art dealers were so impressed that a bidding war broke out among them until Mrs. Spelce agreed to a show at the Kennedy Galleries in 1972.         Although her work included portraits of family members and some urban scenes, Mrs. Spelce's favorite subject was her childhood farm, a decidedly busy and happy place, according to her renderings, and one that clearly gave her a much recollected contentment in her long nursing career.         In addition to her sons, Neal and Bennett, both of Dallas, Mrs. Spelce is survived by two sisters, Inez Robertson of Jackson, Calif., and Marie Colvett of Grass Valley, Calif., and two grandchildren.         Correction:  May 22, 1998, Friday  An obituary on April 19 about Fannie Lou Spelce, a nurse who became a prominent folk artist, misspelled the name of the Arkansas town where she was born and misidentified both the residence of Mrs. Spelce's sons and the town in which she lived before moving to Austin, Tex. Her birthplace is Dyer, not Dwyer. The sons, Neal and Bennett, live in Austin, not Dallas. Mrs. Spelce previously lived in Houston, not Dallas. This correction was delayed by inadvertent misrouting at The Times.       
         Mary Bancroft Boulton, a psychotherapist who helped introduce to New York City the practice of transactional analysis, which tries to help a patient correct self-destructive behavior patterns in relationships with other people, died at her home in Greenwich Village on May 30. She was 86.         Transactional analysis became popular after Dr. Eric Berne published ''Games People Play'' in 1964 (reissued in paperback by Ballantine Books in 1996). Dr. Boulton studied with Dr. Berne in San Francisco, then brought the new therapy to New York in 1966 when she founded the New York Transactional Analysis Seminar with Dr. Marian Weisberg and Dr. Barbara Rosenfeld.         Transactional analysis, often done in group therapy, delves into the multiple roles each person plays, as a child or parent, for example. One of Dr. Boulton's sons, John Bancroft, said, ''She would often say to me, 'Well, that's your child speaking,' or, 'That's your parent speaking.' ''         Dr. Boulton was also concerned with the roles thrust upon her patients, particularly women, by society.         In one article, she said patients not only needed to escape from the smothering influence of demanding parents but also needed to defy ''the 'big guns' of our culture -- traditional religious teaching, educational practice, literature, television, and the toys and games which are prescribed for boys and girls.''         The New York seminar, modeled after one run by Dr. Berne, was open to any psychotherapists who wanted to learn the new therapy, Dr. Weisberg said.         The seminar met until 1973, when Dr. Boulton and Dr. Weisberg opened the Gotham Institute for Transactional Analysis, a training institute that closed in 1978. Dr. Boulton continued her private practice until she retired in 1990.         Dr. Boulton was born Mary Elizabeth Holzman in Cincinnati on Aug. 9, 1911. She received a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Cincinnati in 1932 and a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania in 1935. She received her Ph.D. in 1980 from Northern Indiana University.         She married Frank Bancroft in 1935, and they were both active in left-wing causes.         Mr. Bancroft died in 1959. Dr. Boulton married John Wallace in 1962; the marriage ended in divorce.         Dr. Boulton married Schroeder Boulton in 1965, and their home in Greenwich Village became a gathering spot for people in civil rights and antiwar work, Mr. Bancroft said.         Dr. Boulton is survived by her husband; three sons, Carter Bancroft, of Huntington, N.Y., and Michael and John Bancroft, both of Seattle; three stepdaughters, Janet Boulton, of New York, Nancy Boulton, of Lincoln, Mass., and Tiffany Wallace, of Lexington, Ky., and seven grandchildren.       
         Maureen O'Sullivan, a leading Hollywood actress in the 1930's and early 40's best known for playing Jane to Johnny Weissmuller's Tarzan in the series of popular jungle adventure movies, died yesterday at the Scottsdale Memorial Hospital in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 87. Ms. O'Sullivan, who was the mother of the actress Mia Farrow, had homes in Phoenix and Grantham, N.H.         One of the brightest of ingenues, the actress appeared in more than 60 films, from ''Tugboat Annie'' to ''Pride and Prejudice,'' starring with everyone from Robert Taylor to the Marx Brothers. But she was always identified with the lovely, legendary Jane, teaching the niceties of civilization and romance to the yowling Tarzan, Edgar Rice Burroughs's King of the Jungle. It was a notable pairing of opposites.         Her other movie successes included ''The Thin Man,'' ''The Barretts of Wimpole Street,'' Greta Garbo's ''Anna Karenina,'' ''A Day at the Races,'' ''A Yank at Oxford,'' ''The Crowd Roars'' and ''David Copperfield'' (with W. C. Fields).         Ms. O'Sullivan never studied acting and was modest about her talents, telling a 1986 interviewer: ''I didn't pretend to be an actress. I just tried to be natural, the best I could.''         In another interview, she recalled that the praise she received in 1935 for her performance in the death scene of a child bride in ''David Copperfield'' was not because of her skill, but because of the directorial wizardry of George Cukor. ''They raved about my agonized look and the tears in my eyes,'' she said, ''but it was all because George was twisting my feet off camera.''         She retired from full-time filmmaking in 1942 to bring up the children (eventually seven) she had with her husband, John V. Farrow, a movie writer, director and producer, and made only occasional films until 1963. In that year, Mr. Farrow died of a heart attack. She then moved her family from Southern California to Manhattan.         In 1962, she made her Broadway debut in Sumner Arthur Long's ''Never Too Late,'' playing opposite Paul Ford as a suddenly expectant middle-aged wife. Both also appeared in the movie version of the comedy. After that, Ms. O'Sullivan had an active career as a Broadway actress, starring in ''The Subject Was Roses,'' ''Keep It in the Family,'' ''No Sex Please, We're British,'' ''Charley's Aunt'' and the charming 1980 revival of Paul Osborn's ''Morning's at Seven.''         Woody Allen gave Ms. O'Sullivan her most luminous screen role, when she was 75, in his 1986 hit ''Hannah and Her Sisters,'' in which her children included her daughter Mia. The script required the aristocratic Ms. O'Sullivan to call herself ''a boozy old flirt with a filthy mouth.''         In her major scene, she resumes drinking after her husband (Lloyd Nolan) has repeatedly berated her for flirting with a young television crewman while the couple were acting in a commercial.         Hailing her performance, Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote that Ms. O'Sullivan ''never had five minutes on the screen to equal her work here.''         Ms. O'Sullivan compared Mr. Allen favorably to Mr. Cukor, who was renowned for his skill in directing women.         ''George had a preconceived idea, and he made you do his concept of what he wanted,'' she recalled. ''I liked working with Woody more because I felt he would, in his gentle way, find out in you what you could do and let you do it.'' After the highly public breakup of Mr. Allen and Ms. Farrow, Ms. O'Sullivan was very outspoken about siding with her daughter.         Maureen O'Sullivan was born on May 17, 1911, in Roscommon, Ireland, to Maj. Charles Joseph O'Sullivan and the former Mary Lovatt Fraser. She was educated in convents of the Sacred Heart in London, Dublin and Paris. Desiring an acting career, she read widely and concentrated her studies on writing and music.         When she was 18, she had a chance meeting with Frank Borzage, the American director, who was in Dublin filming ''Song o' My Heart,'' starring the celebrated tenor John McCormack. She passed a screen test to perform as his daughter and went to Hollywood to complete the film. She appeared in several more Fox movies and then won longterm contracts with MGM.         She was first matched with Weissmuller in ''Tarzan, the Ape Man'' in 1932. As Jane Parker, Ms. O'Sullivan was rescued by Tarzan and chose to stay with him in the jungle. Five other Tarzan pictures followed. The last with the two actors (and Cheetah the chimpanzee) was ''Tarzan's New York Adventure'' in 1942.         Her later films included ''Peggy Sue Got Married,'' Francis Coppola's 1986 fantasy in which her granddaughter (played by Kathleen Turner) visits her from the future. ''There's nothing to worry about, dear,'' Ms. O'Sullivan lovingly assures her. ''You're just browsing through time.''         The actress's honors included a Roman Catholic Interracial Council's 1980 award as ''a distinguished Catholic who has worked to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our society.''         Ms. O'Sullivan also wrote ''The Umbrella'' and other short stories.         In 1983, she was married a second time, to James Cushing, a construction company executive.         In addition to Mr. Cushing and Mia Farrow (who lives in Connecticut), she is survived by five other children, Patrick and Theresa, both of  Vermont, John Jr. of Maryland, Prudence of Iowa, and Stephanie of New York City; 32 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren. Michael, her oldest son, was killed in a plane crash in 1958.         As the matriarch of a very large family, she was asked about off-screen motherhood. ''The real way to bind children to you is to let them go,'' she said. ''Clutching is no good; it simply makes them determined to be rid of you. But once they're free, they surprisingly want to come back to you as friends.''         Ms. O'Sullivan was irritated at times about the repeated references to her as Tarzan's Jane, but later accepted it as a kind of folkloric signature.         She said that the famous line ''Me Tarzan, you Jane'' was improvised on the set. The two actors were sitting on a high branch of an MGM tree, and Weissmuller pretended that he was pushing her off, and she pretended that she was pushing back. He said, ''Jane.'' She said, ''Tarzan.'' He said, ''Jane.'' Then he said, ''Me Tarzan, you Jane,'' and the director said, ''Keep it in the script.''       
         Shirley Polykoff, the pioneering advertising woman who came up with a single double-entendre that changed the face, or rather turned the heads, of American society, died on Thursday at her home on Park Avenue. She was 90 and the author of the ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' slogan, which unleashed American women to choose the color of their hair.         In an era when hair color is no longer a fiat of nature but a routine fashion choice, it is easy to forget that as recently as the mid-1950's hair coloring was such an exotic exception to a cultural norm that only 7 percent of American women dared dye their hair, mainly actresses, models and other fast women.         Then in 1956 Miss Polykoff invented the ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' campaign for a tiny Bristol-Myers division known as Clairol. Almost overnight, the slogan became a national catch phrase, and dyed hair (although never thereafter, she made sure, known that way) went from declasse to de rigueur.         Attracted by the slogan and its reassuring tag line, ''Hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure,'' within a decade nearly half of all American women were regularly coloring their hair, and sales of dyes, tints and rinses had soared from $25 million to $200 million a year, with Clairol accounting for more than half the total (as it does today with industry sales of more than $1 billion).         Once the lone female copywriter at the giant Foote, Cone & Belding advertising agency, Miss Polykoff became the agency's lone female executive vice president, the toast of Madison Avenue and the 1967 Advertising Woman of the Year.         For the Brooklyn-born middle daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants, especially one whose mother wanted her to be a boy, the triumph was hardly a fluke. From the time she was 11 and made ''$3 and change'' for 12 hours' work selling coats in a Brooklyn department store, Miss Polykoff had relished proving herself in the traditional masculine role of breadwinner.         By the time she arrived at Foote, Cone & Belding in time to take over the new Clairol account in 1955, Miss Polykoff, who had written her first advertising copy as a teen-age secretary at Harper's Bazaar, had long since established herself as a star in retail advertising, first for a series of department and variety stores, including Bamberger's and Kresge in Newark, then for New York agencies with retail accounts.         As one of the few women in a male-dominated industry selling almost exclusively to women, the traditional household purchasing agents, Miss Polykoff had an advantage over her sometimes obtuse colleagues, particularly those who told her the proposed ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' campaign was too suggestive.         In her 1975 book, ''Does She . . . or Doesn't She? And How She Did It,'' Miss Polykoff recalled that when similarly obtuse executives at Life magazine turned down a 10-page Clairol layout because of the double-entendre, she challenged them to poll the women in the magazine office.         When the dirty-minded executives could not find a single woman who thought the line had any smutty connotation, Miss Polykoff was not surprised. She had realized all along that well brought-up women of the 1950's, the Clairol target audience, would never admit, as she put it, ''that a nice girl ever got an off-color meaning about anything.'' The ad ran, and, as she recalled, ''everybody got rich.''         To some latter-day feminists, Miss Polykoff was somewhat perplexing, on the one hand an obvious pioneering role model for professional women, on the other a woman whose success, which included such campaigns as ''Is It True Blondes Have More Fun?'' and ''If I've Only One Life to Live, Let Me Live It as a Blonde,'' depended on catering to women's vanity as sex objects.         Miss Polykoff, who frankly used her femininity to charm men and who chided modern businesswomen who try to ape men, did not apologize. For all her ambition and outsized success as a woman, Miss Polykoff was cut from a pre-feminist mold, never forgetting, as she often put it, that she was ''a girl first and an advertising woman second.''         Growing up as the awkward middle daughter between two raven-haired beauties, Miss Polykoff, who saw her blond hair as her only physical distinction (at least until she began to develop what she called her ''sexy curves''), was so distraught when her hair began to darken as a teen-ager that she began having a local hairdresser lighten it, just to make the back match the front. That fiction sufficed until her future mother-in-law secretly asked her son the Yiddish foreshadowing of ''Does she  . . . or doesn't she?''         Miss Polykoff also unabashedly put husband and family above her career, going so far as to hold her Foote, Cone salary to $25,000 so as not to earn more than her lawyer husband, George P. Halperin. After he died in 1961, the agency doubled her salary twice in less than a decade, and when she retired in 1973 to open an agency under her own name she had been Foote, Cone's highest paid salaried employee for many years.         She is survived by two daughters, Laurie Zucker of Athens, Ohio, and Alix Nelson Frick of Manhattan, the president of Franklin Spier Advertising; a sister, Lillian Ovberg of Glen Cove, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  June 15, 1998, Monday  An obituary last Monday about Shirley Polykoff, the advertising woman who devised the slogan ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' in 1956 to advertise hair coloring products, referred incorrectly to the ownership of the advertiser, Clairol. The company was independent at the time. It was acquired in 1959 by the Bristol-Myers Company, now Bristol-Myers Squibb.       
         Julia Perles, a longtime Manhattan lawyer who played an important part in bringing about a significant change in New York State's divorce legislation, died early Wednesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla. She was 84 and had lived in Sarasota for about four years.         The cause was not immediately clear, but she had had a fall at her home, said Janet Post, a friend.         Ms. Perles is widely considered to have played the leading role in bringing about the passage of what is popularly known as New York State's equitable distribution law, which went into effect in 1980. The law brought about what its admirers have called a revolutionary change in the practice of matrimonial law and in the rights of marital partners.         At her death, Ms. Perles was still affiliated with the law firm of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon, based in Manhattan, where she became a partner in 1970, having been invited by Louis Nizer to head the firm's matrimonial practice.         She went on to become a senior partner until about eight years ago,  and remained head of her department until she moved to Florida. After that, she continued to be affiliated with the firm and its matrimonial department.         While she was practicing matrimonial law, she became chairwoman of a special committee of the New York County Lawyers Association. The panel's members were respected specialists in marital law who favored getting the equitable-distribution change made in the state law. Committee members communicated with the State Legislature in Albany repeatedly, former colleagues of Ms. Perles recalled, and it took much attention and perseverance to persuade the Legislature to make the change.         Under the law as it was passed in 1980, both spouses, in the event of a divorce, are enabled to share equitably in the assets that either or both of them have accumulated during the marriage, even if title to the property -- a house for instance, or a business -- is in the name of only one spouse. Parties to a marriage did not have that legal right in New York State before the law was passed.         The underlying assumption behind the law is that both parties to a marriage contribute to the acquisition, maintenance and growth of the marital assets.         Ms. Perles's clients over the years included Woody Allen; Nancy Allen, the actress-wife of Brian De Palma, the movie director; the former Eve Ella Sherpick Green, the first wife of Harry B. Helmsley, the New York real estate titan; David Merrick, the producer; and Ethel Scull, who once was called the doyenne of the pop art world.         Ms. Perles was a former president of the New York Women's Bar Association, a fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and a member of the Dirty Thirty, an organization of American lawyers prominent in the field of matrimonial law.         She was born and raised in Brooklyn, and she wanted to be a lawyer from the time she was 12 years old. Rona J. Shays, a close friend, recalled that Ms. Perles used to say that her own mother had not wanted her to go to law school and had said to her, ''No one will want to marry you if they think you're smarter than they are.''         Nevertheless, Ms. Perles went on to attend Brooklyn College, and she received her law degree in 1937 from Brooklyn Law School.         She was an associate in the Manhattan law firm of Schwartz & Frohlich from 1942 to 1952 and then a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Greenbaum Wolff & Ernst before going to Phillips, Nizer.         In 1951 she married Howard Singer. He died in 1989.         Her survivors include a brother, David Perles, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Dorothy West, ''the Kid'' of the  Harlem Renaissance circle of writers and artists in the 1920's who was rediscovered seven decades later when her novel ''The Wedding'' was published and became a best-seller,  died on Sunday night at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard.         Miss West, who began writing stories at age 7 in her family's elegant four-story house in Boston, was not yet 20 in 1926 when her short  story ''The Typewriter'' won a prize from the Urban League's Opportunity magazine. Encouraged, she  moved to Harlem and joined the poets, novelists, musicians and other artists forging a cultural renaissance there. Long before her death, she was frequently described as the last surviving member of that group.         ''We thought we were going to be the greatest writers in the world,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. 'We were all young and we fell in love with each other. We all had the same ambitions: writers and painters and so forth. We were free. . . .We had an innocence that nobody can have now.''         Langston Hughes gave Miss West the nickname ''the Kid'' and took her to Russia in 1932. She asked him to marry her but he declined. Soon she received a proposal from Countee Cullen, the poet who received one of the first Guggenheim Fellowships given to an African-American. She turned him down. She shared an apartment with Zora Neale Hurston, the writer and folklorist, and when guests came to the loft of Wallace Thurman, the novelist and editor, she was always there, sitting on the floor.  She had a bit part in the original stage production of ''Porgy and Bess.'' Claude McKay, already established as a poet and novelist, scolded her for not writing more.         ''We were a beautiful, young group,'' she told a Boston Globe interviewer in 1989. 'We drank too much, though. We drank too much.''         Miss West's first novel, ''The Living Is Easy,'' was not published until  1948, when the Harlem Renaissance had long faded. Her second, ''The  Wedding,'' about the aspirations and anxieties of black people living on Martha's Vineyard, appeared in 1995. Both were written at her family's former vacation home on the  Vineyard, where she had lived year-round since 1947 and was a columnist for The Vineyard Gazette.         At her celebrity-studded 90th birthday party on the island in 1997, which drew hundreds of well-wishers, she was called ''a national treasure'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton.         Miss West's stories and novels used brisk narratives, an eye for detail and wit to explore the aspirations of well-to-do blacks and the interplay of race, class and intraracial tensions in America. Her work was not overtly political, tending to more lyrical depictions of vanity, longing, love and misunderstanding.         ''Color is important, but class is more important,'' Miss West often said in the dozens of interviews she gave after ''The Wedding'' was published by Doubleday and made into a  miniseries by Oprah Winfrey.         Critics praised her storytelling and her pioneering descriptions of  conflict within the black middle class. ''There is an abundance of  psychological and historic richness to her characters,'' Elizabeth Benedict wrote in The Washington Post in 1995, ''and she can be wickedly eloquent about the costs of living in a world where the shadings in the color of one's skin are more important than the bonds between blood relatives.''         Miss West was born on June 2, 1907, in Boston, the only child of Isaac and Rachel West. Her father, born a slave, built a fruit and vegetable business that lifted the family into the slim ranks of Boston's black upper middle class. Her mother, a generation younger, ''spirited, fearless, sassy and smart,'' brought many of her 18 siblings and their families to live with them.         Family members ''ranged in color from the blond child to me,'' Miss  West wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' a collection of short stories and essays published in 1995. ''We were always stared at. . . . My mother prepared us. As she marched us down our front stairs, she would say what our smiles were on tiptoe to hear, 'Come on, children, let's go out and  drive the white folks crazy.'         ''She said it without rancor, and she said it in that outrageous way to  make us laugh. She was easing our entry into a world that outranked us  and outnumbered us. If she could not help us see ourselves with the humor,  however wry, that gives the heart its grace, she would never have forgiven  herself for letting our spirits be crushed before we had learned to  sheathe them with pride.''         The sisters and cousins defended  each other against outsiders, but at home squabbles were melodramatic, Miss West said. ''Surrounded by all these different personalities, each one wanting to be first among equals, I knew I wanted to be a writer.  Living with them was like living inside a story.''         Her work was first published when she was 14, in The Boston Post, and she soon became a regular contributor. After graduating from the Girls' Latin School at 16, she attended Boston University and the Columbia University School of Journalism.         In 1932, she and 20 other black Americans including Langston Hughes, were invited to visit the Soviet Union to work on a proposed movie about racism in America. The film was never made, but Miss West remained in the Soviet Union with Hughes for a year, returning to the United States only when she learned of her father's death.         There remains some question about whether she and Hughes were romantically involved, although she proposed to him in a letter in 1933. In a 1995 interview with The Boston Globe, she said that she never particularly wanted to marry -- ''Seemed like the man just became the woman's child'' -- but had wanted a child.  The memory of how she learned she could not was still painful decades later: the white doctor telling her briskly, ''There are already enough black people in the world.''         Miss West had no immediate survivors, although she remained close to many of her cousins.         In 1934, she founded Challenge, a quarterly magazine intended as a showcase for younger black writers and ''to recapture in the mid-30's the literary vitality of the Harlem Renaissance, which had not survived the Depression.'' Her subsequent magazine, New Challenge -- which reflected the belief of its associate editor, Richard Wright, that art is a weapon -- survived only briefly in 1937.         Miss West became a welfare investigator in Harlem (a job that was the source for several short stories)  and joined the Depression-era Federal Writers Project. In 1940, she began contributing two short stories a month at $50 apiece to The New York Daily News, an association she continued until 1960.         In the summer of 1947, she left New York for good, moving to Martha's Vineyard and the two-bedroom cedar-shingled cottage in Oak Bluffs that her father had bought. She lived there the rest of her life, once writing: ''I have lived in various places, but the island is my yearning place.  All my life, wherever I have been, abroad, New York, Boston, anywhere, whenever I yearned for home, I yearned for the island.''         ''The Living Is Easy'' was published the next year. In this semiautobiographical tale, the strong-willed, light-skinned Cleo Judson -- modeled on Miss West's mother -- tries to remake her darker-skinned  daughter, and breaks up her own  marriage to a former slave who had made himself ''the Black Banana King.'' The book satirizes upper-crust black Bostonians.         In the late 1940's, Miss West began writing columns for The Vineyard Gazette.. While caring for ailing relatives in the now-winterized cottage, she was also slowly writing another novel, published as ''The Wedding'' in 1995. (''The Richer, The Poorer,''  gathering 13 essays and 17 stories Miss West wrote between 1926 and 1987, came out later the same year.)         Starting in 1992, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, then a book editor for Doubleday, had visited the cottage once a week in the summers to work on the long-stalled novel with Miss  West. Mrs. Onassis died shortly before its publication, and Miss West dedicated it to her memory, writing,  ''Though there was never such a mismatched pair in appearance, we were perfect partners.''         Set in the black community on Martha's Vineyard during the 1950's, the novel is a gently ironic story of a beautiful, blond, privileged young black woman, Shelby Coles, who is torn about her planned marriage to a white jazz musician. Using flashbacks from the wedding day to many past generations, it delves into interracial and intraracial bigotry. Miss  West's belief in integration and her penchant for romance coalesced in the final line she gave Shelby Coles: ''Color was a false distinction; love  was not.''         Oprah Winfrey used the novel for a two-part miniseries this year. ''It shows a world that most people have rarely seen, a world where black  families are all highly educated, very successful, living in Martha's  Vineyard,'' Miss Winfrey said.         An energetic conversationalist and inveterate storyteller who was less than five feet tall, Miss West kept her distance from the political upheavals of her lifetime. She went to Communist Russia with Hughes and the others, she wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' because ''I liked them.'' In the 1960's and 70's, Miss West was not active in the civil rights movement and found radicals like the Black Panthers discomfiting.         ''I'm a creative writer,'' she said late in life. ''I'm not a black with a  chip on my shoulder.'' Instead, she often said: ''Color is nothing when you know people.''       
         Shari Lewis, who used her estimable skills as a ventriloquist and puppeteer to win 12 Emmy Awards and the hearts of parents and their children for four decades with a woolly hand puppet named Lamb Chop, died on Sunday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 65 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The cause was complications from uterine cancer, which was diagnosed in June. Ms. Lewis had been undergoing chemotherapy for six weeks, said her spokeswoman, Maggie Begley.  She was thought to be doing well but then developed pneumonia, she said.         Ms. Lewis's illness caused her to cut short her production in Vancouver of the latest television series she was creating for PBS, ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.'' The series began last January and has been a mainstay of PBS programming for children. A spokesman for PBS said yesterday that three remaining episodes will be broadcast in the fall.         This year marked Ms. Lewis's 50th anniversary as a performer. Her career started in 1948 when she appeared in a local NBC show in New York and pulled a rabbit out of a hat (her father had taught her the trick only the day before). Her last PBS series before ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' was ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' which ran from 1989 to 1995. The show won five Emmys in five years as well as a New York International Film Festival Gold Award and many other prizes. She also created holiday specials, including ''Lamb Chop's Special Hanukkah,'' on PBS in 1995, and ''Shari's Passover Surprise,'' with Dom DeLuise as a guest.         Earlier this year, Ms. Lewis said she got the idea for ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' during a conversation with her husband, the publisher Jeremy Tarcher, in which they decided that what children liked most was music, pizza and the beach. The show features Mr. DeLuise as a cook and Chancz Perry as an orangutan who delivers pizza by skateboard.         Ms. Lewis was acknowledged to have all the instincts of a multifaceted entertainer. Although she was never a schoolteacher, she knew how to reach children with her puppet  sidekicks, chief among them being Lamb Chop, an ageless curly- haired creature who would interrupt Ms. Lewis with all manner of observations and questions. Lamb Chop was arguably her most beloved puppet, but in the eyes of children who watched her shows, Charlie Horse and Hush Puppy weren't far behind.         ''I'm a role model,'' she said. ''It's really very funny because I never play teacher. I never play parent. I play older playmate.'' She did this most convincingly even in her 60's.         She was a playmate who loved good music and throughout her career she invented ways to encourage children to love it as she did. And so, when she created ''Lamb Chop Loves Music,'' Ms. Lewis played the piano in the show, which led Lamb Chop to insist that she wanted to learn to play too. Ms. Lewis then told Lamb Chop that her desire to learn piano wasn't enough, that she had to do much more. Lamb Chop had to learn all the instruments, Ms. Lewis said. Lamb Chop agreed, whereupon a collection of instruments came to life to provide a lesson about woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion.         Ms. Lewis felt that ''musical training teaches something that is seldom learned in any other manner: namely, that if you stick to what you are trying to do, you will, eventually, 'get it.' '' She was convinced that the study of a musical instrument builds  neurological connections and better study habits.         She did not limit herself to using her sock puppets to persuade children that they ought to learn an instrument. She took to the podium and conducted symphony orchestras in the United States, Canada and Japan, offering music she thought children would like, especially the sounds of Beethoven, Bizet, Mozart and Stravinsky.         She wrote 60 books for children, including ''Magic For Nonmagicians,'' ''Things That Kids Collect,'' ''One-Minute Bedtime Stories,'' ''One-Minute Favorite Fairy Tales'' and ''One-Minute Greek Myths.'' She also made many recordings, filmstrips and videos for children.         Shari Lewis was born on Jan. 17, 1934, in New York City. Her spokeswoman and family members said she was 65, although the birth date listed in reference books would have made her 64.         She was the daughter of Abraham B. Hurwitz, a college professor who doubled as a magician, and Ann Hurwitz, a music coordinator for the New York City Board of Education and an accomplished pianist. Her mother was an energetic woman who began teaching her daughter piano at the age of 2. But Ms. Lewis said often that she was not a natural pianist and that her passion for music began the day she tucked a violin under her chin.         She studied music theory and orchestration, as well as piano and violin at the High School of Music and Art; dance at the School of American Ballet, and acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She even found time to take baton-twirling lessons.         She seemed to learn ventriloquism on her own. When she was a girl, her father thought he heard a voice coming out of a closet in the Hurwitz's apartment. When he discovered that his daughter had been able to throw her voice there, he found a former vaudevillian to coach her.         She attended Columbia University  and in the 1950's was married briefly to Stan Lewis. She married Mr. Tarcher in 1958. He survives her, along with their daughter, Mallory. Both her husband and daughter collaborated with her in her projects.         Ms. Lewis did not initially gravitate to puppeteering. Her skills in acting and dancing earned her roles in touring company and summer stock productions of ''Damn Yankees,'' ''Bye, Bye, Birdie'' and ''Funny Girl.'' She also performed in nightclubs and casinos and did dramatic roles in television.         Her first big break in show business came in 1952 when she appeared on Arthur Godfrey's televised ''Talent Scout'' show. In 1957 she introduced Lamb Chop on ''Captain Kangaroo,'' which led to her own morning television program for NBC, ''The Shari Show.'' Ms. Lewis's puppets were a staple on NBC from 1957 to 1963.         From 1968 to 1976, she was in London, doing her own television series on BBC-1 every Sunday night, as well as specials that were seen in Canada and Australia.         Ms. Lewis returned to children's television in the United States with ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along.'' She said her work kept her young: ''If you follow your heart, your heart sings and you just dance to that music.''         Peggy Charren, a longtime champion of better television programming for children and a close friend of Ms. Lewis's, recalled yesterday what it was like when Ms. Lewis, accompanied by Lamb Chop, showed up in Washington in 1993 to appear before the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, which was holding hearings on how to strengthen the provisions of the Children's Television Act of 1990.         Ms. Lewis vehemently defended the need to strengthen such protection and then informed Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat  from Massachusetts and chairman of the subcommittee, that Lamb Chop wanted to testify, too. Mr. Markey readily agreed.         Lamb Chop turned to Ms. Lewis and said, ''O.K., you can go now.''         ''If I go, you don't talk,'' Ms. Lewis replied.         So Ms. Lewis remained and Lamb Chop, who always rose to the occasion, gave an impassioned speech about the need for Government to care about children and children's television and to protect young viewers from junk. ''It was one of those things that nobody who was there will ever forget,'' Ms. Charren said.         In Washington yesterday, Ms. Lewis's accomplishments as an educator were praised by Richard W. Riley, the Secretary of Education.         ''By combining humor with teaching and entertainment,'' he said, ''Shari taught us we can laugh and learn at the same time.''         Correction:  August 8, 1998, Saturday  An obituary on Tuesday about the ventriloquist and puppeteer Shari Lewis misstated the name of her first show for NBC television, in 1957. It was ''Shariland,'' not ''The Shari Show.'' From 1960 to 1963, her program was called ''The Shari Lewis Show.'' ''The Shari Show,'' a syndicated program, began in 1975.       
         Jean Fair Mitchell, a violin-playing, jig-dancing Scottish-born educator who guided the venerable Brearley School for girls from the white-glove 1940's through the armband 1960's without missing a beat, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital near her home in Manhattan. She was 88 and had been the Brearley headmistress from 1947 to 1975.         Brearley, or the Brearley as it tends to be known by those who have trod its halls at 83d Street and the East River, has been a forward-looking New York institution since it was founded in 1884 to provide an education for the intellectually gifted daughters of the New York elite.         And by Miss Mitchell's time, its modern character had largely been set by her redoubtable predecessor, Millicent Carey McIntosh, whose departure in 1947 created the opportunity for a remarkable academic trade, one in which Brearley sent Mrs. McIntosh to Barnard College to become dean (and eventually president) and Barnard dealt Miss Mitchell, a member of its English faculty, to Brearley as headmistress.         For all the high-spirited comment it occasioned, the swap was largely a coincidence. After scrutinizing 75 candidates in a five-month search for Mrs. McIntosh's successor, the Brearley trustees announced that Miss Mitchell had been the board's first choice.         If her first decade or so presented few challenges in an era that is, after all, recalled as the quiescent 1950's, Miss Mitchell, a short, husky woman of verve who declaimed the poetry of Robert Burns in authentic dialect and Scottish burr, wasted little time in putting her own stamp on the school. Brearley had made social history by welcoming Jewish students as early as the 1880's, but Miss Mitchell promptly advanced its commitment to social diversity by recruiting its first black students, an effort aided by a Rockefeller Foundation grant to provide scholarships for needy minority students.         She also left her mark on Brearley students. For a woman who had such an austere public persona that girls would sometimes quake before being sent to her office for discipline, Miss Mitchell proved to be a pussycat in private, a warm and understanding woman who seemed to identify with troublemakers, perhaps because as a schoolgirl she had been one herself.         A native of Kirkcaldy, a Scottish town known less for its heather, she liked to point out, than for a large linoleum factory, Miss Mitchell was apparently such a hell-raiser during her school days that when she became headmistress at Brearley, the headmaster of her former school congratulated her as a ''poacher turned gamekeeper.''         Miss Mitchell, who would sometimes tell horror stories about the corporal punishment girls endured at Scottish schools, came away with such an aversion to punishment of any kind that she became famous at Brearley for her reluctance to suspend even the most recalcitrant troublemakers.         Her identification with the aspirations, frustrations and occasional fractiousness of the young was so complete that when the 1960's brought a wave of youthful unrest and rebelliousness over the Vietnam War, she quietly defused the anger among Brearley students, granting upperclassmen, for example, a day off to participate in an antiwar demonstration.         While Brearley students were as rebellious as any teen-agers in the 1960's, Miss Mitchell tended to be so understanding and accommodating that she left the rabble-rousers with little to complain about. When, for example, students decided that Brearley's infamous blue tunic and skirt uniforms, which they had long complained made them look like pears, were symbols of regimentation and oppression, she allowed students to wear more or less whatever they wanted.         Miss Mitchell, who was credited with strengthening science and mathematics courses, also responded positively to student complaints that the Brearley curriculum was not relevant to modern society. But the changes she authorized, like allowing students to substitute Spanish for German and complete their Latin requirements before high school, did not reach the level of some 1960's academic silliness and left the tough core curriculum unscathed.         Miss Mitchell, who received a master's in English from the University of Edinburgh, trained to be a teacher, spent five years teaching at an Edinburgh girls school, then came to the United States in 1936 as a postgraduate fellow at Smith College. She later joined the Smith faculty and taught at Sarah Lawrence for a year before going to Barnard in 1944.         For all her devotion to education, Miss Mitchell, whose father was an engineer, came close to pursuing a music career. At the time she was offered her first teaching post, he was also offered a job as violinist with the Edinburgh Symphony.         She apparently chose education over music as a career because she knew she could always pursue her love of music on her own, as she did at Brearley, where she would play chamber music with students, and at her summer home (a converted one-room schoolhouse) in Blue Hill, Me., where she was deeply involved with the Kneisel Hall music school.       
         Muriel Humphrey Brown, who grew from a shy girl from South Dakota into a confident woman during political campaigns for her first husband, Hubert H. Humphrey, and then was named to fill his seat in the Senate at his death in 1978, died today at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. She was 86 and lived in Plymouth, Minn.         In recent years, Mrs. Brown appeared rarely in public but on Tuesday stood at the side of her son, Hubert Humphrey 3d, Minnesota's Attorney General, when he won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination for governor.         ''Hubert would have been proud,'' she said after her son's victory.         There were many victories in the lives of Hubert and Muriel Humphrey and many setbacks as well. After Humphrey served as Vice President under Lyndon Baines Johnson, he lost to Richard M. Nixon in 1968 when Johnson decided against seeking re-election.         Humphrey had also been defeated for his party's Presidential nomination in 1960 by John F. Kennedy. Muriel Humphrey was at her husband's side for these elections and when he died after returning to the Senate, she was a logical and sentimental choice to succeed him until the 1978 election, when she did not run to keep the seat.         Because of her shyness she had to work at the roles that came to her.         ''If someone had told me what would be happening to me today,'' she said after the Democrats nominated Humphrey for President in 1968, ''well, it would have been an awful thing to have thought of. I just wanted to be a wife.''         Hubert Horatio Humphrey ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the constant campaigner of the constant candidate.         In her roles as the wife of a public figure and in her own brief time in the Senate, Muriel Humphrey supported the social programs that her husband championed. She pressed for the right of a woman to have an abortion and, when her granddaughter Vicky was born mentally disabled, she became involved in work for people with mental disabilities.         In 1988, when President George Bush disparaged liberalism, Muriel Humphrey responded: ''There's something I've been wanting to say for a long time. I'm a liberal and I'm proud of it. In fact, I was probably a little more liberal than Hubert was. I just wanted to say that.''         By then she was Muriel Humphrey Brown, having married Max Brown, a widowed Nebraska businessman who had been a classmate in Huron.         In addition to her husband and her son Hubert 3d, Mrs. Brown is survived by a daughter, Nancy Solomonson, and two other sons, Bob and Douglas, all of suburban Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.

Hubert Horatio Humphrey ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the constant campaigner of the constant candidate.         The Humphreys met in the early 1930's when Muriel was a student at Huron College. They married in 1936, and Mrs. Humphrey worked as a bookkeeper at a utility company to put her husband through college.

         They were the Thelma and Louise of Nazi Poland, and if Hollywood hasn't tumbled to their story, it may be because Blanca Rosenberg and Maria Rosenbloom had too many hair-raising escapes, too many improbable rescues -- and far too much unremitting horror in between -- for a single script to handle.         Then again, for all the appeal of the wily and intrepid heroines -- the blond, blue-eyed Bronislava, as Mrs. Rosenberg was known, and her brunet sidekick, Maria -- Mrs. Rosenberg's 1993 memoir, which described in rollicking and harrowing detail how the two young women survived the Holocaust while posing as Catholic peasants, left the story unfinished.         While it continues for Dr. Rosenbloom, a retired professor at the Hunter School of Social Work who lives in Manhattan, the story has now ended for Mrs. Rosenberg, and with satisfying flair.         Her death on Sept. 11 at her apartment in Manhattan -- at the age of 85, in her own bed, after a long, peaceful retirement and a distinguished career as an assistant professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work -- was a triumphant flick of her hand, almost six decades coming, to the German soldiers who had arrived in the small city of Kolomyja in eastern Poland (now Ukraine) on July 3, 1941, and tacked up posters that declared in three languages, ''Death to All Jews.''         As Mrs. Rosenberg made clear in her book, ''To Tell at Last'' (University of Illinois Press), it did not take too many aktions in the increasingly depopulated Kolomyja ghetto for it to become apparent that the Nazi regime intended to kill each and every Jew in Poland -- including those, like Mrs. Rosenberg and Dr. Rosenbloom, who had documents identifying them as essential workers at a clothing factory.         At the time of the German invasion, Mrs. Rosenberg, a native of Gorlice who had studied law at the University of Cracow, was the 27-year-old wife of a doctor who had escaped the Nazis by accepting a medical assignment with the retreating Soviet Army, leaving her behind with an infant son, Zygmund, and her adored younger brother, Romek.         Mrs. Rosenberg's son, siblings, parents and other relatives died in the Holocaust, but her husband survived. The couple were divorced after the war, and she promptly married an old flame, Sam Rosenberg, a gynecologist who became a psychiatrist in New York. Dr. Rosenberg died in 1982.         After watching her brother virtually volunteer for death during a mass ''selection,'' Mrs. Rosenberg escaped to the nearby city of Lwow armed with a birth certificate, supplied by her compassionate factory manager, belonging to a Polish Catholic woman who had died.         If she had kept to herself, Mrs. Rosenberg might have had a safer time of it. But she was continually befriending those, like Dr. Rosenbloom, whose appearance increased the likelihood that they would be unmasked.         As a ground-zero account of life on the run, Mrs. Rosenberg's book is filled with crosscuts between cities and a dizzying array of hurried apartment changes, narrow escapes and ruthless shakedowns by police officers, greedy landlords and freelance extortionists.         In one scene, for example, the young women escape through a back window of a military hospital in Lwow, where they had been working, as the police are coming in the front door (they had been betrayed by one of Dr. Rosenbloom's former college classmates who had spotted her in a bookshop). This is swiftly followed by a scene in which they make their way in disguise past wanted posters with their pictures (from their hospital identifications) at the Lwow train station, which is in turn followed by their arrival in Warsaw -- in the midst of the abortive ghetto uprising of April 1943 -- and their immediate arrest on suspicion of being Jews.         The two women spent the last months of the war working for German families in Heidelberg.         Mrs. Rosenberg said that she originally wrote her book in 1948 as a way to deal with the paralyzing guilt she felt as a Holocaust survivor, and that she published it to satisfy her brother Romek's last request that she stay alive to tell the story of the Kolomyja ghetto to the world.         She is survived by twin sons, Alex of Athens, Ga., and Mark of Coimbatore, India, and two grandchildren.       
         Frances Hamerstrom, who discovered a passion for observing nature as a young girl in Boston and pursued that passion throughout a life spent mostly in Wisconsin, died on Aug. 29 at Edgewater Haven, a nursing home in Port Edwards, Wis. She was 90.         An author, conservationist and wildlife biologist, she died three days after her last foray into the grassy fields near her rural home in Plainfield, Wis., which she shared with a great horned owl that assisted her in attracting hawks.         Bought and preserved through her fund-raising campaigns, the grasslands near Mrs. Hamerstrom's home shelter some 2,000 greater prairie chickens. The species, similar to the grouse, was stabilized largely through Mrs. Hamerstrom's efforts after farming and other human activities had shrunk its native prairie habitat.         There on the prairie, she informally taught hundreds of visitors. Sometimes she would lead them to the nest of a kestrel, a type of falcon, where she would keep a baby bird warm inside her shirt until it was measured and banded. Then she would often load a mouse into a trap to toss it onto the road in hopes of catching an adult kestrel for banding.         Each April and May, her assistants, from Boy Scouts to businessmen, would sit inside a canvas blind before dawn, often in freezing weather, to watch the ritual spring displays of male prairie chickens, who emit a hearty booming sound like a kettledrum that is heard for miles in the still air.         At age 86, on a field trip in Peru to watch the black-collared hawk feed on fish, she broke a hip trying to reach a hunting area while traveling with a guide up a tributary of the Amazon. She was evacuated by canoe. Then, at 87, she went back to Peru and traveled up another river in an effort to observe indigenous hunters.         Among her 12 books was ''Harrier Hawk of the Marshes: The Hawk That Is Ruled by a Mouse,'' the result of her 25-year study of the relationship between the harrier and the vole. It was published by the Smithsonian Institution Press in 1986.         Mrs. Hamerstrom and her husband, Frederick, met and married on the East Coast and then both attended the University of Iowa, where Mrs. Hamerstrom, always proud that she had flunked out of Smith College, received a bachelor's degree in 1935. They also both went to the University of Wisconsin at Madison, where they studied with the conservationist Aldo Leopold, the author of ''Sand County Almanac.'' Mrs. Hamerstrom received a master's degree there in 1940.         In the 1930's, Frances Hamerstrom was one of the first women to ''crash the barrier into the all-male wildlife research profession,'' said Dr. Ray Anderson, a retired professor at the University of Wisconsin at Stevens Point. She also became a crack wing-shot with a Parker 20-gauge shotgun and wrote a book called ''Is She Coming, Too?'' about the hunting trips she had taken at her husband's side. Both of them worked for the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Her husband died in 1990.         Mrs. Hamerstrom, who was born in Needham, Mass., is survived by two children, Elva Hamerstrom Paulson of Roseburg, Ore., and Alan Hamerstrom of Arnold, Md.; two granddaughters, and a brother, Putnam Flint of Weston, Mass.         To allocate her time, Mrs. Hamerstrom applied the ''Hamerstrom Rule of Thirds'': a third for the worthless red tape that your boss requires; a third for doing what is wanted of you; a third for doing exactly what you please.         She lived for 50 years in a house with no running water that had not been painted since the Civil War and had no heat aside from a few cast-iron wood-burning stoves. She only occasionally swept around the piles of turtle shells, snowshoes, wildlife gear, books and files, all of which served as evidence of what it was that pleased her.       
         IN November 1939, shortly after Adolf Hitler touched off World War II, a British writer commented about the two World Wars: ''The last one was a soldier's war. This one is everybody's.''         ''And so it was,'' said an octogenarian, Ruth Kornblum, who lives in White Plains. She flew planes for the Army Air Forces in World War II and will mark another Veterans Day on Nov. 11.         Soon after Europe went to war in 1939, American men volunteered or were drafted as America prepared. But women went to war, too, going into factories, into desk jobs and into the military. Mrs. Kornblum, then Ruth Kupferberg of Eastchester, was one of them. At 25, she was single and a registered nurse. She first volunteered to join a military hospital unit but ended up as a civilian flier of military planes. The United States was still at peace early in 1941 when she was introduced to a man who operated a flying service at Little Ferry, N.J., and in the course of the friendship he taught her how to fly the company's seaplane.         The two most famous American women in aviation at that time were Amelia Earhart, who had disappeared in the Pacific while on an around-the-world flight in 1939, and Jacqueline Cochran, who in 1953 became the first woman to break the sound barrier.         When Britain went to war, Ms. Cochran, an ambitious and daring woman, recruited 22 American female pilots to ferry warplanes in Britain. They flew Hurricanes, Mosquitos and Lancaster bombers from factories to Royal Air Force bases. Ms. Cochran once flew a bomber across the Atlantic to Britain on a lend-lease delivery.         When the United States entered the war, Ms. Cochran and the volunteers were ordered home. She made a pitch to President Franklin D. Roosevelt and to General of the Army Henry H. (Hap) Arnold, chief of the Army Air Forces, to get women involved in military flying to free men for combat air duty. There were already plenty of experienced female pilots; 500 of them belonged to the Women Flyers of America.         The Government moved slowly but finally arrived at a compromise. It gave the female fliers civil service status for what was really a military job -- ferrying planes around the country from factories to air bases and from one base to another. They eventually received uniforms that looked like officers' uniforms, wore wings and insignia that looked like officers' issue and had meals at the officers' mess at air bases. Like the men, they went through close-order drill every morning to make them march like a military group. But they were civilians under military jurisdiction. Ms. Cochran wanted officers' commissions for the female fliers, but there was pressure on Congress from thousands of civilian men who also wanted Army Air Forces commissions.         Mrs. Kornblum said that at the time her desire to learn to fly intensified and that she asked to be relieved of her enlistment in a military nursing group. She quit her nursing job and continued her flying lessons. Her objective was to attain the essential 35 hours of solo flying because Ms. Cochran, who was director of the newly organized Women's Airforce Service Pilots, had sent out a call for volunteers. As a result, 25,000 women applied, and Mrs. Kornblum was one of the 1,860 accepted as WASP's for training in April 1943. She switched from seaplanes to land planes and in winter even trained on planes equipped with skis.         The WASP's were trained at Avenger Field in Sweetwater, Tex. Mrs. Kornblum and the other hopeful aviators paid for their own transportation to get there. They were in training for six months and got a $150 monthly salary, which was increased to $250 upon graduation. It was the same instruction given the male Air Corps recruits.         Mrs. Kornblum was in the sixth group to receive instruction. They studied meteorology, navigation, engines and the Morse code, and learned how to load cargo in a plane.         Searching her memory back 65 years, Mrs. Kornblum said: ''I really enjoyed it. Texans were friendly to us, inviting us to barbecues, and one rancher even sent over buffalo steaks -- remember, meat and a lot of other things were rationed.         ''We all had parachutes, and they taught us what to do if we had to bail out. However, we didn't actually make any practice jumps. Except for one girl. She got her induction to parachute jumping by mistake. ''She was flying solo in a single-engine, open-cockpit plane when she made a training spin that turned it upside down. She had neglected to tighten her seat belt and went flying into space. Luckily, she pulled the rip cord, like she had been trained, and came back to earth safely.''         Mrs. Kornblum continued: ''But, you know, you don't learn everything in class. I was flying a Cub from El Paso, Tex., to Rome, N.Y. -- an awfully long distance for a plane that flew 80 miles an hour. I had no instruments, just a compass, and I had to go over a 9,000-foot-mountain. And it was cold because we had open cockpits and no heater. That plane generally flew at 3,000 feet. I had to circle round and round, gaining a little altitude each time, until I finally got even with the peak. I cleared the top so close I could see bugs on the ground! Then I immediately had to look for a landing field because I needed gas. That trip took a week.''         But she did not think of herself as particularly courageous. Still feisty at 81, Mrs. Kornblum said: ''We all loved to fly, and we were doing our bit for the war. That's all.''         She recalled another flying incident, saying: ''Another time, we were in a group, five or six planes, flying west out of Lockhaven, Pa., and we ran into massive head winds. We weren't too high, and when we looked down on the highway we could see cars and even Amish horse and buggies traveling faster than we were. We had no radio contact, but when we saw the group leader descend -- with no airfield in sight, we all followed and landed in a grassy field to wait until the wind subsided. We had to go to a farmhouse to telephone our destination that we'd be late. The group leader told them, 'Not to worry, we're all in one piece.' ''         While Mrs. Kornblum was flying AT6's and Cubs, other WASP's flew B-17 Flying Fortresses, A-20 Havoc attack bombers and P-51 Mustang pursuit planes.         In 1977, through the intercession of Senator Barry M. Goldwater of Arizona, the WASP's were recognized for wartime military service and awarded honorable discharges, given medals and veterans' benefits.         Mrs. Kornblum does not fly anymore, but she is still active and, except for a little arthritis, fit.         One of her volunteer activities is doing ''a bit of everything'' for the Fort Hill Theater group, but she does not act herself. ''I do not perform,'' she said. ''I get cold feet!''       
         Lila Katzen, a sculptor whose abstract works have adorned spaces from Fordham University's campus at Lincoln Center to the United States Consulate in Hamburg, Germany, died Sept. 20 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 72  and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Philip.         Ms. Katzen was born and raised in Brooklyn. Early in life, when she realized she wanted to be a painter, she began studying at the Art Students League in Manhattan and later graduated from Cooper Union. Ms. Katzen also studied with the abstract painter Hans Hofmann.         She began her career as a painter and as early as 1955 had a solo exhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art. A decade later she began working with plastic, and in 1968 she created a multicolored plastic floor with ribbons of black and gold for the Architectural League of New York. In 1970, she made a series of light tunnels for the Sao Paulo Biennale in Brazil, and in 1988 she was the American representative to World Expo 88 in Brisbane, Australia, where she exhibited a 20-foot-high sculpture of Cor-Ten steel.         Ms. Katzen's work is in the permanent collection of museums across the country, including the National Gallery of Art, in Washington, the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford and the Milwaukee Art Center.         Throughout her life Ms. Katzen was a visiting professor at schools around the country, including Wichita State University, Lehman College in New York and Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Denize, and a son, Hal, all of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Haru Matsukata Reischauer, a journalist and author who was influential in diplomatic affairs in the 1960's as the wife of the United States Ambassador to Japan, died on Sept. 23 in La Jolla, Calif. She was 83.         The cause of death was heart failure, a former colleague said.         Mrs. Reischauer's deep understanding of both Japanese and American cultures and mores made her highly qualified to ease tensions between the two countries in the early 60's. As the embassy's First Lady, she was crucial, her former colleagues said, in bringing a psychological end to the postwar occupation of Japan.         She grew up in Tokyo, the daughter of a prominent Japanese statesman and a mother who was an American of Japanese descent. As a child, she had an American tutor, and she graduated from Principia  College in Illinois.         Late in life, she traced the roots of her family's tradition of statesmanship and their appreciation of America. In ''Samurai and Silk: A Japanese and American Heritage'' (Harvard University Press, 1986) she told the story of her two grandfathers: one, born to a peasant family, became a wealthy silk merchant in New York; the other, from a samurai family, rose to be Prime Minister twice and a powerful Finance Minister responsible for overhauling Japan's financial system in the 19th century.         Not until the end of World War II -- which she spent in Japan, feeling ''totally out of place,'' said a colleague from her embassy days -- did her bicultural background become useful.         ''Suddenly, everything opened up,'' said George R. Packard, who is now president of the U.S.-Japan Foundation in New York. During the 1950's, she wrote regularly about Japan for The Saturday Evening Post and The Christian Science Monitor.         But it was through her husband that she became an major influence in establishing friendly relations between the United States and Japan. The writer James Michener introduced her to Edwin O. Reischauer, a widower with three children and a Harvard professor of Japanese Studies. As teen-agers, it turned out, they had gone to the same Tokyo high school, where she had had a secret crush on him.         Robert Immerman, a senior research associate at Columbia University's East Asian Institute, who also worked at the American Embassy when she was there, said that before her marriage in 1956, ''she was never at home in either culture.'' Afterward, he said, she moved easily in both. ''Somehow that relationship fulfilled her.''         In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Mr. Reischauer Ambassador to Japan. ''Relations seemed to be coming apart,'' Mr. Packard said. The Japanese Government was under pressure at the time from groups on the left that wanted to end the security arrangement with the United States.         In those tense times, Mrs. Reischauer could easily have found herself distrusted by both the Americans and the Japanese. Instead, said Mr. Packard -- who was then a special assistant to the Ambassador -- she became widely respected, even esteemed.         She came to be considered Japan's most popular woman, after the Empress. She went out of her way to be considerate with embassy employees, said Mr. Immerman, a junior embassy officer at the time. For instance, she opened the swimming pool, long reserved for the Ambassador's family, to everyone. She brought in influential Japanese people ignored by earlier administrations -- intellectuals, writers and leaders of citizens' groups.         She and her husband were a team.  Before making decisions, Mr. Reischauer would consult with his wife, Mr. Immerman recalled.         ''She had a major role in helping him shape U.S. policy,'' he said.         In 1966, at the conclusion of his appointment, the Reischauers returned to Cambridge, Mass., and to Harvard. Later, they went to California. Mr. Reischauer died in 1990.         One stepson, Robert D. of Bethseda, Md., following the family tradition of public service, went on to become director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.  She is also survived by two stepdaughters, Ann Heinemann of La Jolla and Joan Simon of Larchmont, N.Y.; two sisters, Naka Rawthroen of Los Angeles and Mari Bruck of Studio City, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.         Mr. Packard described her role in bringing together the United States and Japan. ''She, herself, was a bridge,'' he said. ''She represented an America that was friendly and respectful to Japan.''       
         Alicia Parla, a sinuous Cuban-born beauty who had a brief but incandescent run as the international Queen of the Rumba, died of cancer on Tuesday at her home in Miami. She was 84 and was recalled as the teen-age sensation who became the toast of New York and Paris, captivated crowned heads of Europe and taught the rumba to the Prince of Wales, Josephine Baker and a generation of Depression-weary revelers.         O.K., it wasn't the rumba. As purists never tire of pointing out, the dance by that name that swept America and Europe in the 1930's and became an Arthur Murray staple was such a tame, watered-down version of the Afro-Cuban original that it was closer to a dance the Cubans call the son.         Never mind. The authentic street rumba of Havana, whose extravagant, explicit gestures seem more suggestive of mating than of a mating dance, is not something one would have actually wanted to do on a dance floor before the 1980's, or ever on stage.         Whatever its pedigree, in Miss Parla's hands, or rather hips, the dance the world came to know as the rumba was such an appealing sight that she and it became overnight sensations.         For Miss Parla, at least, it took some doing. A native of Havana, where her father was a prominent doctor, she attended a convent school in Key West, Fla., then moved to New York with her mother during a period of political instability in Cuba in the 1920's.         Fortunately, as she pointed out in a 1995 interview with John Dorschner of The Miami Herald, her father, a man so strict that he would never have countenanced dancing as a career, stayed behind in Havana.         Not that her mother was not strict, too. From the time she was 9, Miss Parla recalled, her mother warned her almost daily that if she did not remain a virgin she would never find a man to marry her.         It was advice that Miss Parla seems to have taken to heart, in part, perhaps, because her admitted teen-age ambition was to marry a millionaire.         Her father had other ideas, insisting that his daughter obtain a measure of self-sufficiency by learning to type, ''until a millionaire comes along, as he put it.''         A dutiful daughter, Miss Parla obliged, but since she was a little girl her real passion had been dancing, and when a man who ran a dance studio in her apartment building marveled at her skill, she began to get the notion that she might actually become a professional.         She got her chance in 1931 after she began working as a 17-year-old cigarette girl at a Greenwich Village nightclub, a job she was able to take over her mother's objections only after promising never to let her father know, agreeing to let her mother serve as on-the-job chaperone and threatening suicide, something Miss Parla did with alarming regularity throughout her life.         Then came the inevitable night that the club's Spanish dancer became ill. Miss Parla volunteered to take her place, and, well, she was such a hit and gained such confidence that when the celebrated Cuban band leader Don Azpiazu issued a call for a rumba dancer for a gig at the Paramount a few weeks later, Miss Parla tried out, along with 150 other hopefuls, and got the job.         During rehearsals she was paired with a man, but she found him so clumsy and the whole experience so embarrassing that she persuaded Mr. Azpiazu to let her dance alone, as she did from then on. ''The rumba is very sexual,'' she explained, ''and I didn't like doing it with a partner.''         The decision may well have been crucial in allowing the rumba's eventual acceptance by a puritanical world, since for all Miss Parla's sensuous gyrations, the sight of a woman dancing alone was simply not as sexually suggestive as a couple dancing together.         It was the Paramount engagement that helped make the Azpiazu recording of ''El Manisero'' (''The Peanut Vendor'') a national hit and the foundation of the rumba craze of the 1930's.         After touring the United States with the Azpiazu orchestra (a musician's wife serving as her chaperone), then dancing with another orchestra at the Tavern on the Green in Central Park, Miss Parla (and her mother) joined Mr. Azpiazu for a European tour in 1932.         It was during an engagement in Monte Carlo that Miss Parla caught the eye of two future kings of England, Edward, the Prince of Wales, and his brother Albert, the Duke of York, who later became King George VI. The next day Edward summoned Miss Parla to his villa to teach him the rumba, as she did (with her mother tagging along). ''He got it,'' she said. ''He was very good.''         When another of her Monte Carlo conquests, Maurice Chevalier, asked her to go to Nice with him for the night, Miss Parla declined, saying, as she recalled, ''Oh, Mr. Chevalier, I'm so sorry. I'm a virgin.''         For all her triumph in Monte Carlo, Miss Parla was hardly prepared for what happened when she opened in Paris that July. When she made her entrance walking down a grand staircase wearing a slave scarf and a costume decorated in red, white and blue, the colors of the Cuban flag, the crowd went wild, she recalled, and began shouting ''Vive La France.''         Miss Parla later learned that it was Bastille Day and that the crowd had taken it as a tribute to France when she appeared wearing the colors of the French flag. The next day,  she was hailed by critics as ''the Cuban Mariana,'' (the French Uncle Sam, she was told) and the name stuck. Within weeks, ''Mariana scarfs,'' copied from her costume, were on sale in chic French shops, Miss Parla had taught Josephine Baker to rumba and had made a side trip to Brussels, where King Leopold was so enchanted he gave her a box of chocolates so big she danced on it for him.         After a triumphant return to the United States aboard the Ile de France in 1933, Miss Parla spent a year dancing at Mon Paris nightclub, where she was hailed by Walter Winchell as ''that lovely Havana torso flipper.'' Finally bowing to her father's wishes, she returned to Havana at the end of 1934 and married a few months later. She was not yet 21, but her reign as the Queen of the Rumba was over.         After her first husband, the playboy son of a wealthy rancher, discovered he couldn't keep her down on the finca after she'd seen Paree, Miss Parla obtained a divorce and later married Guillermo Amuchastegui, a celebrated jai alai player who took her all over the world, and she hobnobbed with the likes of Orson Welles and Esther Williams (when she wasn't in Cuba hobnobbing with Ernest Hemingway).         When Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Miss Parla, by then married to a Batista government official, fled to the United States and settled in Miami. To make ends meet the former Queen of the Rumba, her father's daughter to the end, spent 20 years working as a typist.         Miss Parla is survived by a daughter, Ileana Comas, and a sister, Zilia Navarete, both of Miami, and two grandsons.       
         Dr. Marcia L. Storch, an innovator in women's health care, died Nov. 9 at her home in Tenants Harbor, Me. She was 65.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         She was best known as a private practitioner who was widely influential in changing the rules of treatment for women in the 1970's. Until then, relatively few women practiced as gynecologists and fewer still in the field that came to be known as feminist medicine, in which women were encouraged to take a hand in making informed medical decisions for themselves.         ''She was the first self-declared feminist physician,'' said Barbara Seaman, a medical historian.         Phyllis Chesler, a co-founder of the Women's Health Network and author of ''Women and Madness,'' called Dr. Storch ''both a pioneer and role model in feminist medicine.''         Dr. Storch was born in Pittsburgh. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and the Medical College of Pennsylvania. In 1971 she moved to New York City.         She directed the Adolescent Gynecology and Family Planning Clinic at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, which provided treatment as well as information on birth control and sexually transmitted diseases to tens of thousands of disadvantaged teen-agers.         Before Dr. Storch, Ms. Seaman said, women were expected to take orders and leave the thinking to their gynecologists.         According to Ms. Seaman, Dr. Storch insisted that patients in her downtown Manhattan practice take an active part in deciding everything from what form of birth control to use to whether to attempt childbirth without painkillers. And she aggressively promoted care for neglected problems like premenstrual syndrome and menopause.         After her retirement from private practice in 1989, she sought a wider audience for her approach to medicine as a television and radio producer. She created specialized programming for family physicians on the Lifetime medical network, and later became the head of Ob/Gyn news for the Medical News Network.         Dr. Storch is survived by Jean Hewitt, her partner of 20 years, and a  sister, Suzanne Storch of Inverness, Calif.         (American Medical Association)  Marcia L. Storch wanted patients to help make the decisions.       
         Paula Kissinger, a refugee from Nazi Germany who held the Bible at the White House in 1973 when her first-born son, Henry, was sworn in as Secretary of State, the highest Cabinet post in her adopted land, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday in Manhattan. She was 97.         From the time she arrived in America in 1940 with her husband and two young sons until the time she died, Mrs. Kissinger lived in the same apartment in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, where  she was well known and well regarded by the once large German-Jewish  emigre community there.         It was Mrs. Kissinger -- the practical one in the family -- who decided that they had to leave Germany when Hitler came to power. Dr. Henry Kissinger told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that his father was reluctant to recognize the growing evil around him. ''My father was lucky he had an earthy wife who made all the decisions,'' he said.  ''She looked after necessities.''         She got in touch with a cousin in New York, and it was soon arranged.  ''It was my decision, and I did it because of the children,'' she told Mr. Isaacson. ''I knew there was not a life to be made for them if we stayed.''         Mrs. Kissinger was born Paula Stern in 1901 into a prosperous middle-class family in Leutershausen. In 1922, she married Louis Kissinger.  He was 35; she was 21. They moved to Furth, where he was a teacher, and within the year their first son, Heinz Alfred, was born. He took the name Henry when the family came to the United States. The next year a second son, Walter Bernhard, arrived. Both sons, as well as six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, survive Mrs. Kissinger.         When she arrived in New York she quickly mastered the language and, to supplement the money earned by her husband and her sons, she became a cook and a caterer in Washington Heights. She refused to leave the neighborhood, even after her husband died 10 years ago and her elder son asked her to move in with him and his wife downtown.         Several years ago, she fell in her kitchen and was unconscious for several hours. She was put on a life-support system, but when doctors wanted to remove it, her son Henry refused. When the doctors explained that she wouldn't be able to think or speak, he replied, ''You don't know my mother.'' After being unconscious for days, she awoke and asked him, ''What day is it?'' When he told her it was Tuesday, she said, ''Cancel my 10 o'clock dentist appointment.''         She returned to Germany a few times, once when Dr. Kissinger was given an honorary degree. She was struck by the unreality of it all.  ''First you get chased away, and then you get treated like royalty,'' she told a reporter. Back home, when her son came to visit, the neighborhood was all excited and she admitted to being proud: ''They say, 'My son the doctor.' What should I say, my son the Aussenminister?' ''       
         Jean Dalrymple, who abandoned a nascent acting career to become a successful publicist, then an even more successful manager of concert artists and finally a dynamic producer of musicals and plays for City Center and other stages, died on Sunday at her Manhattan home, across the street from City Center. She was 96.         Miss Dalrymple's stature in the New York theater world was enhanced by her uncanny ability to lure just the right actor for a particular role at a price that City Center, with its limited budget, could afford. Her skillful productions nourished and entertained audiences there from the 1940's through the 60's.         Among the center's offerings during her tenure as director of its theater and light-opera companies were plays by Shakespeare and Shaw, Sartre and Tennessee Williams, with actors like Jose Ferrer, Charles Boyer, Franchot Tone, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, Charlton Heston, Helen Hayes and Tallulah Bankhead. She also revived musicals by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Frank Loesser, Rodgers and Hart, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.         The productions were quite polished. Indeed, after an opening of one Rodgers and Hammerstein revival, Miss Dalrymple received a floral tribute from the composers with a note that said, ''We wish last night had been the Broadway opening.''         In her day, Miss Dalrymple was one of a handful of formidable female producers; the others included Cheryl Crawford and Irene Selznick. She was as tough as they were, a woman in perpetual motion, but she did not seem that way.         ''Jean always had a kind of solid serenity about her,'' said Robert Whitehead, the producer. ''She had a great determination to get things done, but she was always very feminine, very pretty. She was an extraordinary person.''         Franchot Tone, an actor whose work Miss Dalrymple always admired, thought of her as ''the tenderest little lady.'' But a writer from The Cleveland Plain Dealer described as her as ''as fragile as a Fragonard painting but hep and with a sense of timing like a Garand rifle.''         In addition to luring actors, she was also able to persuade producers to give the City Center sets and costumes when their plays and musicals ended their runs. Thus, her revival of ''My Fair Lady'' featured the original costumes.         Creating a 'Temple' For Performing Arts         City Center, for which Miss Dalrymple worked so long and hard, was established on West 55th Street in 1943 by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and City Council President Newbold Morris, who wanted it to be a ''temple for the performing arts,'' offering productions for a top price of $2.         Miss Dalrymple was there at the very beginning. Her success with their dream was such that when the center turned 50 in 1993 and called itself ''a glorious home for dance, music, opera and dozens of extraordinary musicals and plays,'' there were many who thought the phrase an understatement of what Miss Dalrymple had accomplished.         Initially serving as volunteer director of public relations and as a member of its board, Miss Dalrymple remained at the middle of City Center's publicity apparatus even after she started producing and directing. At the same time, she served as personal manager to performing artists like Leopold Stokowski, Mary Martin, Jose Iturbi, Andre Kostalanetz, Nathan Milstein and Lily Pons.         Jean Dalrymple was born on Sept. 2, 1902, in Morristown, N.J., to George and Elizabeth Collins Dalrymple. There was no shortage of money in her family; her grandfather, an officer in the Civil War, had founded a coal and lumber business that sustained the family very well.         When she was 9, she finished a short story, ''The Spinning Top,'' and sold it to a Newark newspaper for $1. Encouraged by this success, she wrote more stories for a Philadelphia paper, receiving $5 for each one. But even in those days, she thought of writing as secondary to her goal of becoming a stage director.         After completing her secondary education, Miss Dalrymple moved to New York, studied secretarial skills at a business school and got a stenographer's job on Wall Street when she was only 16. She even made a respectable sum in the market before the crash of 1929. The crash propelled her out of Wall Street and into vaudeville. She created an act with her beau Dan Jarrett and worked with James Cagney and Cary Grant on the Keith-Orpheum circuit.         During this period, she tried her hand at playwriting; ''Salt Water,'' written with Mr. Jarrett, was produced by John Golden. She was hired by Golden as an understudy, casting director, play doctor and press agent, and her skill in handling the press so impressed him that he encouraged her to work at it full time.         It also impressed Ward Morehouse, the drama critic for The New York Sun, so much so that in 1932 he proposed marriage. It was not a successful union, but in the five years they were together, they collaborated on a screenplay, ''It Happened in New York,'' which was made into a movie by Universal Pictures.         Miss Dalrymple was married in 1951 to Maj. Gen. Philip de Witt Ginder, who died in 1968. No immediate family members survive. The funeral will be held on Thursday at 1:30 P.M. at the West Point chapel.         Miss Dalrymple was one of the founding members of the American Theater Wing, the theater service organization. In 1939 she was its first publicity volunteer, and during World War II, she trained speakers who sold war bonds during the time of the Stage Door Canteen.         By 1940, Miss Dalrymple was working as an independent press agent, much sought after because of her contacts. Among the Broadway plays for which she handled the publicity were ''Mr. and Mrs. North'' (1941), ''One Touch of Venus'' (1943)  and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1944).         In 1945, she turned to producing. Her first effort, a collaboration with Marc Connelly, was ''Hope for the Best,'' a comedy by William McCleery, who had been Sunday editor of the newspaper PM. She did not leave the publicity business but pursued more producing ventures, among them ''Brighten the Corner'' (1945) and ''Burlesque'' (1946).         Meanwhile, she began to devote more of her energy to developing productions for the newly formed City Center, which was started in the old Mecca Temple that had been built years before by the Shriners. It had been taken over by the city for nonpayment of taxes and it stood idle, except for its occasional use as the site for Civil Service examinations.         Early productions included Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town,'' mostly because it required no scenery and was inexpensive to produce, and ''Porgy and Bess,'' which the center snared as it was completing a national tour.         Miss Dalrymple was especially proud of her production of ''Porgy.'' ''I had an overwhelming desire to restore it to its original form and present it exactly as as George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward had created it, as an opera for the Metropolitan,'' she once recalled.         One Misstep, Angering Sartre         In her 1975 memoir, ''From the Last Row,'' she recalled that Howard Taubman of The New York Times ''loved it'' but that Judith Crist of The New York Herald Tribune said she preferred the original Broadway version. ''I wrote her,'' Miss Dalrymple said, ''and told her she had a tin ear.'' She was pleased that this production of ''Porgy'' sold out and that ''Miss Crist never held my impulsive letter against me.''         In 1948, Miss Dalrymple thought she had scored a coup when she succeeded in getting Jean-Paul Sartre's permission to produce his play ''Les Mains Sales'' in an English adaptation by Daniel Taradash called ''Red Gloves.'' She followed this up by inducing Charles Boyer to make it his first Broadway role.         What began as a coup threatened to become a coup de grace; Sartre read Taradash's adaptation after he gave Miss Dalrymple the go-ahead and was filled with loathing for it. He loudly denounced it publicly as ''a vulgar, common melodrama with an anti-Communist bias.'' When the play opened, Brooks Atkinson echoed Sartre's denunciation and wrote in The New York Times that it was a production that ''looked and sounded bogus.'' It quickly closed.         But she scored many triumphs in the years that followed. Word of her organizational abilities spread and in 1951 the State Department asked her to arrange for what the United States would offer at the Berlin Arts Festival that year. In 1958 the State Department called on her again, this time to arrange for the performances sent by the United States to the Brussels World's Fair, including those by Harry Belafonte, William Warfield, Jose Iturbi and the Juilliard String Quartet.         In 1953, she persuaded Jose Ferrer to star in and direct four plays at the City Center during an eight-week season: ''Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ''The Shrike,'' ''Richard III'' and ''Charley's Aunt.'' To help City Center grapple with its tight budget, Mr. Ferrer and all the cast members in these productions worked for the Actors Equity minimum.         Mr. Ferrer called the center ''this happy beehive of the arts,'' and donated $1,000 to the cause. The season was a critical and box-office success. ''They have made the theater seem like a fresh, exciting, varied form of public art,'' Atkinson wrote in The Times.         In 1956 Miss Dalrymple persuaded Orson Welles to appear in ''King Lear'' (he performed in a wheelchair after breaking a leg in rehearsals) and Tallulah Bankhead to play Blanche Dubois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Both productions earned critical praise.         Among Miss Dalrymple's other warmly received revivals were ''The Beggar's Opera,'' ''Brigadoon'' (with Edward Villela as the villain), ''Pal Joey'' (with Bob Fosse in the title role), ''Guys and Dolls'' (with Walter Matthau as Nathan Detroit) and ''The Pajama Game.''         When her revivals turned a profit, Miss Dalrymple used the money to subsidize City Center's other companies, the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera, both of which moved to Lincoln Center in 1964. Her revivals were doomed in the late 1960's, however, when the city began to experience a series of fiscal crises.         Among Miss Dalrymple's other books were an autobiography, ''September Child'' (1963), ''Careers and Opportunities in the Theater'' (1969), ''Jean Dalrymple's Pinafore Farm Cookbook'' (1971) and ''The Folklore and Facts of Natural Nutrition'' (1973).         As a producer, Miss Dalrymple tended to play down her adroit handling of the press, which is critical in the success of even the most expertly produced play. ''I never went in for theme parties or the crazy events that publicists stage today,'' she said in 1993. ''I simply advertised the facts of the production. At City Center, that was always enough.''       
         If you saw her at all, you'd see her in a cemetery late at night. She'd be clambering about one of those huge cemeteries in Brooklyn and Queens, the ones beneath the flight paths to La Guardia and Kennedy, the ones you can see from certain expressways; the graveyards with comforting names like Evergreen, Mount Neboh and Cypress Hills. She was there on the hottest, stickiest summer night when New Yorkers without air-conditioners couldn't sleep, and she was there when the temperature was below zero and the snow was hip-deep and nobody was awake.         In the moonlight and even when there was no moon, amid the chalk-white and gray polished marble sentries guarding the dead of a great city, Gloria Marie De Martini Stradtner looked only for life in the necropolis.         Mrs. Stradtner, who died on Dec. 22 at the age of 72, looked for stray animals. She looked for the thousands of dogs and cats abandoned every year by people who, having tired of their pets, thought not of bringing them to an animal shelter but of leaving them in a cemetery. Humans may think of cemeteries as woodland-like sanctuaries. But for animals, they are only places to starve to death in the wild.         But Gloria -- as everyone called her -- was determined that this was not to be. Not for her strays.         And so for 50 years or maybe more (nobody can remember when she did not make the rounds of the graveyards at night), she would go forth, lugging large bags of dog food and cat food and big and small traps of the type that cannot hurt animals. She would bait these traps and go back to her car and wait. In an hour or so, she would return to her traps. Sometimes, she would entrap a dozen animals or more in a single night, her prisoners of love. And then she would feed them.         Mrs. Stradtner never had much money, and so to supplement the dog and cat food she bought with her Social Security money she would take jobs working in catering halls, even when she was getting on in years, so she could scoop up the scraps and bring them to her strays in the graveyards. When she was younger, back in the 1950's, she worked as a clerk and data entry specialist for I.B.M. But she did not mind doing menial work in a catering hall. Not if it meant she could feed the animals.         And after she fed them, she would spend the next day making the rounds of veterinarians, imploring their help to neuter the dogs and cats  (they usually charged her reduced fees, which she paid with the money from her modest Social Security check). And then she would visit the shelters, asking them to please take and care for the dogs and cats that New Yorkers did not want.         With her puppies and kittens in tow, she visited shelters outside New York. One was Pegeen Fitzgerald's Last Post Animal Sanctuary all the way up in Litchfield County, Connecticut, near the Massachusetts line. They try to specialize in housing cats there, but when Mrs. Stradtner showed up with dogs from the graveyards of New York, they took in dogs, too.         ''I would estimate she saved thousands of animals,'' said Jeanne Toomey, who runs Last Post. ''She was wonderful. She'd name dogs and cats in the cemetery and she'd bring them up here. Nobody could refuse her.'' She visited animal sanctuaries in Long Island, upstate and in New Jersey, too, and nobody refused her in those places, either.         Sometimes, her friends would go with her on her night visits. Michael Puccino, an executive with a Manhattan computer consulting firm, and his wife, Anne Marie, a veterinary nurse, would help whenever they could. And the cemetery workers helped, too. When it was bitter cold, the workers in at least one cemetery opened the door to a heated mausoleum so the strays could spend the night there. In another cemetery, they built little igloos in the bitterest part of the winter, hoping that Mrs. Stradtner's strays would use them to keep warm.         Mr. Puccino told her more than once that cemeteries are not the safest places to be after dark. But she scoffed at such advice. ''She was the most adventurous, the liveliest individual you'd ever meet,'' Mr. Puccino said. When she was in her 70's, everybody thought she was in her 50's.         Last August, somebody stole her car, which was parked on a Brooklyn street near the house on Chestnut Street where she lived.         ''She called me, and she didn't care about the car,'' Mr. Puccino said. ''She was angry because there were 100 pounds of dog food in the trunk.''         Last summer, there was a dog she was worried about. She called the dog Peekaboo because it peeked around gravestones at her. Peekaboo kept having litters. In one delivery, she had 10 pups. Mrs. Stradtner was determined that Peekaboo be spayed. But Peekaboo was elusive. She would come when Mrs. Stradtner called her name, but no closer than 10 feet. Peekaboo was quite wild, covered with fleas and ticks, and she trusted nobody; life in a cemetery does that to a dog.         One day about six weeks ago, Mrs. Stradtner's speech became slurred. Mr. Puccino spoke to her on the telephone and asked her if she had been drinking. He knew she had not been drinking. She never drank and had not smoked for 20 years.         She stayed with the Puccinos briefly, and Mr. Puccino had her examined at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore. The doctors there said she had cancer. It had started in her lungs and spread to her brain. Then, she moved to Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan; she knew somebody who worked there.         She called Mr. Puccino on Dec. 20, two days before she died. Mr. Puccino said that she wanted to make sure that Peekaboo had been spayed (she was) and that her own two dogs, Lance and Ivy, would be taken care of after she died (he promised her they would be).         The people who knew her and loved her were not sure yesterday about her next of kin. She had been married to a man named Stradtner for three years, maybe 40 years ago. Nobody knew where he was. They had no children. Her sister, Gladys Semino, had predeceased her. Her friends thought, however, that there were cousins.         Somebody found a poem she was believed to have recently written, and at her funeral last Saturday, it was read. It was entitled ''Weep Not'' and began this way:         Do not weep for me when I am gone         For I have friends in the great beyond.         All the little ones I used to feed         Will come to me in my time of need.         They will purr and bark in great delight,         And I will hold and hug them tight.         Oh what a great day that will be         When my furry friends all welcome me.
