         Tanaquil Le Clercq, one of the greatest of American ballerinas, who was George Balanchine's ideal muse and Jerome Robbins's happiest inspiration at the New York City Ballet in the 1940's and 1950's, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 71 and had homes in Manhattan; Weston, Conn.; and Windermere, Fla.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the New York City Ballet said.         In a tragic end to her performing career, the still-young ballerina contracted paralytic polio in 1956 while she was at the peak of her powers. At the time she was also married to Balanchine, his fourth wife. Her luminously elegant style, the freshness of her long-legged wit and her mysterious dramatic perfume had attracted an adoring public. The dance world went into shock.         Yet although she remained paralyzed below the waist, Ms. Le Clercq became a teacher at Dance Theater of Harlem, wrote two books and frequently attended dance performances. In 1998, City Ballet opened its 50th-anniversary season with a tribute to her as a charter member of the company and to her legendary status within it. Ms. Le Clercq acknowledged a tumultuous ovation at the New York State Theater from her wheelchair as Peter Martins, the company's artistic director, presented her with a bouquet.         The tribute included films of her performances and interviews. Robbins, who cast her as the sensuous girl in his ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' summed up her range. ''Tanny,'' he said, ''could do anything.''         With an elongated physique that she used with refinement or humor (Balanchine once cast her as a dragonfly), she epitomized the modernized look in classical dancing that Balanchine was promoting in the United States in the 1940's. As the first City Ballet ballerina personally trained since childhood by Balanchine, she was naturally identified with his major works and the roles he created for her in them. These ballets included ''Symphonie Concertante,'' ''Symphony in C,'' ''Bourree Fantasque,'' ''Western Symphony'' and ''La Valse,'' in which her doomed heroine danced herself to death with chilling fervor.         Nonetheless, she was equally unforgettable in the Robbins ballets and as the stunning white-faced allegorical figure of Sacred Love wafted high above the ground by a male retinue in ''Illuminations,'' which the British choreographer Fredrick Ashton choreographed for City Ballet in 1950. In 1949, she was also willing to experiment in Merce Cunningham's works in Europe.         Ms. Le Clercq was one of those singular dancers whose dramatic projection and brilliant technique could appeal simultaneously to a broad audience and a cultlike following of artists and writers.         She was born in Paris on Oct. 2, 1929. Her mother, Edith Whittemore, was American, and her father, Jacques Le Clercq, was a French poet and writer. Their daughter was named after an Etruscan queen and was 3 when the family moved to New York.         At 7, Ms. Le Clercq began studying with Mikhail Mordkin, the former star of the Bolshoi Ballet. In October 1941, she won a scholarship competition at the School of American Ballet, founded in 1934 by Balanchine, Lincoln Kirstein and others. Ms. Le Clercq also attended the French Lycee and the King-Coit School.         Although Balanchine and Kirstein had no permanent ballet company at this time, Balanchine cast her in 1945 in a student performance of ''Symphonie Concertante,'' a ballet to Mozart. After Kirstein and Balanchine founded Ballet Society in 1946, the precursor to City Ballet, she recreated her role as the second ballerina opposite Maria Tallchief, whom Balanchine had married in 1946.         As a 15-year-old in 1944, Ms. Le Clercq had also appeared in ''Resurgence,'' a short piece Balanchine created for a benefit for the March of Dimes. Balanchine portrayed an evil character, Polio, who caused Ms. Le Clercq to look paralyzed.         Balanchine would later refer to the event as an omen of the polio attack suffered by Ms. Le Clercq while she and Balanchine were on tour with City Ballet in Copenhagen. Her misfortune affected many deeply. Robbins wrote her every day during the first year of her illness.         Balanchine returned to choreography in 1957. But even in 1959, B. H. Haggin, a critic who was especially devoted to the ballerina, wrote that for some spectators, there was ''an aching feeling of loss over the absence of Le Clercq from the works in which they had watched the development of her extraordinary powers as a dancer and as a stage personality.''         Particularly amazing was that Ms. Le Clercq affected so many in a professional career that lasted only 10 years. She was not the only dancer who served as a muse to Balanchine or with whom he had a relationship. After his first wife, Tamara Geva, left him, he lived with the ballerina Alexandra Danilova and subsequently married Vera Zorina and Ms. Tallchief. He married Ms. Le Clercq in 1952, and they were divorced in 1969. There are no immediate survivors.         Ms. Le Clercq created 32 roles for Ballet Society and City Ballet. She danced the dynamic ''Choleric'' variation in the 1946 premiere of Balanchine's ''Four Temperaments.'' In 1949 she appeared in two pieces by Merce Cunningham (''Games and Trio'' and ''Amores'') in a Paris studio.         Kirstein saw her as ''the epitome of Balanchine's lyrically athletic American criterion.'' Repeatedly, she combined French elegance with American energy, as was obvious in her dance-hall girl in ''Western Symphony,'' which Balanchine set to cowpoke tunes in 1954. Strutting on toe and her needle-sharp long legs, she exhibited flair and flounce; vulgarity was anathema to her dancing.         Her work was colored, above all, by a mysterious individuality. Others succeeded her in ''La Valse,'' a neo-romantic work by Balanchine to Ravel. But few could exemplify her pathos and fragility as she threw her head back and plunged a hand into a long black glove.         In some ballets, she was irreplaceable. In ''The Concert'' (1956), Robbins's big comic hit, she was a daffy heroine who struck a serious note with a long introspective solo. Robbins dropped the solo after Ms. Le Clercq stopped dancing.       
         Linda Eder Jamieson Storrow, a former actress, magazine executive and official New York City greeter for the State of New York who was  host for 13 years of a radio program  celebrating those she called ''splendid seniors,'' died at her Manhattan apartment on Jan. 6. She was 90.         The program, called ''Looking Forward'' for its final seven years from 1991 to 1998, when it was broadcast on WYNE in New York, took up  topics from affordable housing to octogenarian sex to tap-dancing in one's 90's. For its first six years, it was called ''What Keeps Us Going'' and was broadcast starting in 1985 by In Touch Networks.         Linda Eder was born in Manhattan on Dec. 11, 1910. Her father was a lawyer whose family owned a large sugar mill in Cali, Colombia, where she spent part of her youth. At the Lincoln School, she developed a passion for acting. She made a bargain with her father that she would attend Skidmore College for one year if she could then leave school to become an actress. She became part of the company of Walter Hampton, a prominent Shakespearean actor, and also had a small part in the Broadway production of ''Cynara,'' which opened in 1931, before her father strongly discouraged her from acting because she might be taking jobs from poor people.         In 1940, she married Francis A. Jamieson, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1933 for his coverage of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby.         When Mr. Jamieson worked as an aide to Nelson Rockefeller in the State Department, she returned to acting for a year, playing a villainess in a radio soap opera broadcast in Washington. As Mr. Jamieson went on to play a prominent role in Mr. Rockefeller's campaign for governor in 1958, she taught reading and acting to poor children as a volunteer. Mr. Jamieson died in 1960. Governor Rockefeller appointed her the state's official greeter of foreign dignitaries in New York City.         In 1962, she married James J. Storrow III, who became publisher of The Nation magazine in 1967. In 1973, he named her associate publisher. She also wrote articles and served as its United Nations observer.         The Storrows turned the magazine over to its next publisher, Hamilton Fish III, in January 1978. Mr. Storrow died in 1984.         She is survived by her daughters, Margot Witty of Manhattan and Frances Jamieson Unger of Silver Spring, Md.; two stepdaughters, Joan-Ellen Jamieson Zucker of Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Margaret Storrow of Brookline, Mass; three stepsons, Gerald Storrow of Somerville, Mass., Peter Storrow of the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, and James Storrow of Stormville, N.Y.; seven grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandson.       
         Dr. Dorothy M. Horstmann, an epidemiologist, virologist, polio pioneer and the first woman appointed as a professor at the Yale School of Medicine, died on Jan. 11 in New Haven. She was 89.         She had Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. I. George Miller, a colleague and professor of virology at Yale.         Dr. Horstmann died as the World Health Organization was on the verge of eradicating polio and four days after the death of Dr. Joseph L. Melnick of Houston, another polio pioneer with whom she worked and wrote scholarly papers.         Dr. Horstmann made significant scientific, educational and public health contributions, and her major scientific achievement was showing that the polio virus reached the brain by way of the blood, a finding that upset dogma and helped make polio vaccines possible.         ''The widely held feeling that the virus grew solely in nerve cells had to be set aside,'' said Dr. John F. Enders, who won a Nobel Prize for developing a technique that allowed the polio virus to be grown in cells.         At the time, scientists believed that the polio virus directly attacked the nervous system because efforts to isolate the virus from the blood of paralyzed patients had failed. The reason they failed became apparent when Dr. Horstmann's team detected the polio virus in the blood of infected monkeys and chimpanzees before signs of paralysis appeared. They found that by the time paralysis developed, antibodies had eliminated the polio virus from the blood.         At Dr. Horstmann's 70th birthday party, Dr. Enders said that ''obviously, the disease behaved like many viral infections'' and that ''everyone was relieved to find that poliomyelitis was not an exceptionally bizarre disease, but similar to others.''         Dr. Horstmann's work contributed to the licensing of an oral polio vaccine developed by Dr. Albert B. Sabin from live, weakened virus. The vaccine was tested among millions of people in what was then the Soviet Union. But in 1959, Western scientists were skeptical about the favorable findings reported by Russian, Polish and Czech health workers.         The World Health Organization then asked Dr. Horstmann to study the incidence of polio in the vaccinated areas. She guardedly concluded that the findings were reliable and that the Sabin vaccine was safe and effective. The United States and other countries then licensed it.         Dorothy Millicent Horstmann was born in Spokane, Wash., on July 2, 1911. She earned her undergraduate degree from the University of California at Berkeley and her medical degree in 1940 from the University of California at San Francisco.         It was a time when doctors were first using sulfa drugs to cure pneumonia. Dr. Horstmann said that the combination of that drug advance, lectures by the renowned microbiologist Dr. Karl F. Meyer and her experience with patients during her internship and residency at San Francisco County Hospital piqued her interest in infectious diseases.         Dr. Horstmann spent an additional year training at Vanderbilt University in Nashville and, in 1942, she went to Yale to perform research under Dr. John R. Paul for a year before becoming a specialist in internal medicine. During a polio epidemic in New Haven in 1943, Dr. Horstmann pitched in. She joined the Yale poliomyelitis unit, and soon decided to devote her career to various aspects of infectious agents.         Dr. Horstmann became a pediatrician at midcareer. In 1961 she received her professorship at Yale, and in 1969 she became the first woman to receive an endowed chair there. It was in epidemiology and pediatrics and named for her mentor, Dr. Paul.         She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and was the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.         Dr. Horstmann is survived by a nephew, Paul Rooney, of Ashland, Ore.       
         Florence Tyson, an early practitioner of creative arts therapy who for many years led a clinic for emotionally troubled people in Manhattan, died on Jan. 18 at her home on the Upper East Side. She was 82.         Ms. Tyson founded the community-oriented Creative Arts Rehabilitation Center in Midtown, on the fringes of the theater district, in 1962 and directed it until 1990. She was then a senior consultant until 1995, when the center ran out of money and had to close.         It was one of the first outpatient clinics in the United States to use music, dance, drama, painting and poetry as therapy.         Born in Brooklyn, Ms. Tyson majored in art at Brooklyn College and had an early career in advertising and as a fund-raiser. She began to practice music therapy in the 1950's when it was new and music in a mental hospital was looked upon as largely recreational.         But based on her experience in mental hospitals, she insisted that the arts could also be effective tools in the treatment of many conditions, including schizophrenia and chronic depression.         She founded and directed a fund that raised money to send unemployed musicians to work with hospital patients.         As the trend of emptying the state's large mental institutions grew, she started her center in a basement and later moved it above a restaurant at 51st Street and Eighth Avenue. Her idea was to keep patients from relapse and readmission.         She elaborated on her approach in a book, ''Psychiatric Music Therapy: Origins and Development.'' First published in 1982, it remains in print as a primer for fellow professionals.         Ms. Tyson is survived by her companion, Saul Lishinsky of Manhattan; a sister, Lillian Cohen of Princeton, N.J.; and a brother, William Tyson of Philadelphia and Cascais, Portugal.         One of her center's staunchest supporters and fund-raisers was Celeste Holm, its president for 18 years. In 1995, the actress offered to sell the Oscar she won for her supporting role in the 1947 film ''Gentlemen's Agreement'' to keep the clinic open, to no avail.         But, in a way, Ms. Tyson's mission had been accomplished. To buttress her belief in it, she liked to quote Friedrich von Schiller, the poet and dramatist, about art ''bringing people to their senses.''         In fact, when the center closed, its trained therapists were able to move on to other such clinics established since she founded hers.       
         Arlene Eisenberg, who with her two daughters wrote ''What to Expect When You're Expecting,'' which became known as the pregnancy bible, died on Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         From girlhood, when she repeatedly read Dr. Benjamin Spock's ''Baby and Child Care'' to qualify for a Girl Scout child care merit badge, to grandmotherhood, when she led the weekly new mothers' group at Ansche Chesed Temple on the Upper West Side, she seemed the perfect mother, but her mission was to tell mothers that they did not have to be perfect.         ''She was my mother, but I lent her out a lot,'' said her daughter Heidi E. Murkoff. ''She was sort of foster mother to the world.''         ''What to Expect When You're Expecting,'' the team's first book in a best-selling series on what to expect from pregnancy, babies and toddlers, was released by the Workman Publishing Company in 1984. Sales were modest at first, but it inexorably climbed to the best-seller list six years later. Without extensive advertising, demand grew by what the authors called ''word of mother,'' with sales now totaling 9.6 million copies in 31 languages.         ''It was quietly marvelous, sort of like Mozart,'' said Peter Workman,  the publishing house president, of the book's success.         In 1999, Good Housekeeping magazine reported that a survey showed that 93 percent of expectant or nursing mothers who had read any book about pregnancy had read it.         Now as common as bibs at baby showers, the book provided common-sense answers to the questions of mothers-to-be. Topics range from diet to delivery to postpartum depression and are arranged by month of pregnancy.         The authors used a question-and-answer format to deal with things people might be shy about asking their doctor, like whether the fetus is aware that the parents are having sex. (No.)         Mrs. Eisenberg said the book responded to a fragmented society in which people often live far from relatives who could reassure them about pregnancy.         ''It used to be you could get all the good information about raising your kids from your mother,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1999. ''But it's all changed. Most young women have never held, never even see, a newborn baby. It's really a shock.''         The first ''what to expect'' book emerged from the 1984 pregnancy of Mrs. Murkoff, Mrs. Eisenberg's younger daughter and a writer who was dismayed that she could find few books about pregnancy that were not excessively didactic and authoritarian -- not to mention full of incomprehensible medical terms. The mother and daughter and another daughter, Sandee E. Hathaway, a nurse, teamed up to fill the void.         They delivered their book proposal to the publisher hours before Mrs. Murkoff gave birth to a daughter, Emma. They delivered the book the day Mrs. Hathaway felt the first kick from the fetus that was to be her daughter Rachel.         The success of the first book led the three to answer readers' pleas for help after birth. In 1989, they published ''What to Expect the First Year,'' and in 1994, ''What to Expect the Toddler Years.'' They also published ''What to Eat When You're Expecting,'' in 1986, and ''The Pregnancy Organizer,'' in 1996. All were published by Workman.         Arlene Leila Scharaga was born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn on June 8, 1934. Her father, Harry Scharaga, headed the Sanitation Department in Queens.         When Arlene was 16, her mother took her to an Eddie Fisher concert at the Paramount Theater. Afterward, they met Mr. Fisher and his young press agent, Howard Eisenberg. Before long, she volunteered to help organize fan clubs for the singer, personally visiting his barber to retrieve locks of the star's hair to send to bobbysoxers around the country.         When there wasn't enough of Mr. Fisher's hair to go around, she would send locks of Mr. Eisenberg's, Mr. Eisenberg said. He began to suspect she was most interested in being around him.         A couple of years later, she said, ''I'm going to be 18 and I don't want to waste any time.''         Mr. Eisenberg asked her to marry him. ''She ran after me until I caught her,'' he said.         She dropped out of Queens College for marriage, but her ambitions and abilities transcended babies. Mr. Eisenberg recounted how he had writer's block on a freelance article for a Sunday supplement that appeared in many newspapers. The day before it was due, Mrs. Eisenberg sat at the typewriter and wrote the entire piece, which with a few revisions, was accepted.         The two wrote articles together for many popular magazines, including The Ladies' Home Journal, McCall's and Sports Illustrated. In 1965, they won the Gold Medal of the National Conference of Christians and Jews for a Look magazine piece, ''The Christian War Against Anti-Semitism.''         The family lived in Garden City on Long Island and in Spring Valley in Rockland County, N.Y., before moving to Manhattan 19 years ago.         When the daughters became adults, the women often collaborated long distance, with various drafts and rewrites conveyed by fax or computer.         Mrs. Eisenberg did not need a guidebook to be a different kind of mother. At a time when breast-feeding was out of favor, she did it with her daughters and a son, Evan. She also insisted on wheat germ and dark bread, prompting her children to envy schoolmates eating white bread in the lunchroom.         In addition to her husband and her son (also a writer), both of Manhattan; Mrs. Hathaway, of Newton, Mass.; and Mrs. Murkoff, of Santa Barbara, Calif., Mrs. Eisenberg is survived by her mother, Mildred Scharaga of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a brother, Victor Scharaga of Washington; and six grandchildren.         Another of Mrs. Eisenberg's legacies is the What to Expect Foundation, which she and Mrs. Murkoff founded after visiting pregnant inmates at Rikers Island, the New York City jail. The foundation is printing a basic pregnancy book written at a lower literacy level for disadvantaged women.         Mrs. Murkoff says she will probably carry on with the next chapter, entirely predictable, in the family's series: ''What to Expect in the Teen Years.'' Emma, whose imminent birth inspired the first book, is 17.       
         Gail Fisher, who won an Emmy Award in 1970 for her portrayal of Peggy Fair, secretary to the gumshoe played by Mike Connors on the CBS television series ''Mannix,'' died on Dec. 2 at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 65.         The cause was kidney failure.         Ms. Fisher's role on ''Mannix'' was the high point of a career that arched from rural poverty in New Jersey to a home in Beverly Hills before descending into problems with drugs and sporadic acting jobs.         At the peak of her career, on ''Mannix,'' whose residuals helped support her later, Ms. Fisher was fiercely proud of her achievement.         ''Well, certain people who had no knowledge of blacks have maybe -- maybe -- learned something because of 'Mannix's' Peggy Fair,'' she said in a 1972 interview. ''Blacks were pretty much alien objects on TV as recently as 10 years ago, you know, and now we're people. I think maybe before it's all over, it's going to be all right, and I'm proud I'm a part of that.''         The series, one of the most violent and longest-running of its era, began  in September 1967 and continued until August 1975. After the first year, to counteract unimpressive ratings, ''Mannix'' was changed, and Peggy Fair, the widow of a police officer who had been a friend of Joe Mannix, was added to the cast.         ''It was really a revolution in casting, you know,'' Ms. Fisher said. ''It was understood by all of us who auditioned that the girl could be anything -- oriental, black, anything -- just a human being. I won.''         Ms. Fisher was also proud of another achievement. ''I was the first black female -- no, make that black, period -- to make a national TV commercial, on camera, with lines,'' she said, referring to a pitch for the detergent All in the early 1960's.         Her achievements bucked discouragement.         ''My friends and family thought I was crazy,'' she said. ''You know, 'But honey, there ain't any black actresses.' ''         But she was determined to be one. She was born in Orange, N.J., and grew up in Potters Crossing, a black section of Edison Township, N.J.         She was one of five children. Ms. Fisher described her mother, Ona, as ''a great lady who brought me up to know there's no such thing as 'I can't.' ''         Ms. Fisher was 2 when her father died. As a teenager she was a cheerleader and a beauty contest winner. She was Miss Transit and Miss Black New Jersey and Miss Press Photographer. She modeled occasionally,  worked in a factory and skipped meals to pay for acting lessons. She studied with Lee Strasberg and  joined what was then the Repertory Theater at Lincoln Center, working with Elia Kazan and Herbert Blau. Mr. Blau cast her as a young firebrand in a 1965 production of ''Danton's Death.''         She took time out for marriage and motherhood and moved to the West Coast, where she had random jobs on minor shows until she auditioned for ''Mannix.''         She was married several times, most notably in 1964 to her personal manager, Joe Levy. The marriage produced two daughters before ending in divorce.         Ms. Fisher is survived by her daughters, Samara Maxe of San Diego and Jole Baerga of Hackensack, N.J.; a brother, Herbert Fisher of Randallstown, Md.; and a sister, Ona Gaither of Alexandria, Va.       
         Emily Vermeule, an emeritus professor of classical philology and archaeology at Harvard University who started her career with the discovery of an ancient Mycenaean tomb and went on to conduct excavations in Greece, Turkey, Libya and Cyprus, died on Feb. 6 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 72.         The cause was heart disease, said her son, Adrian.         ''Professor Vermeule's role in supervising the excavation of a particularly rich Mycenaean chamber tomb in Athens -- and publishing it -- was a wonderful way to get started as a specialist in the Bronze Age of Greece,'' said Sarah Morris, a professor of classics and archaeology at the University of California at Los Angeles and a former student. ''She was only a student then, but this attracted a great deal of attention.''         Gloria Serrari Pinney, a professor of classical archaeology and art at Harvard who was an admirer but never a colleague of Dr. Vermeule, added, ''Her book on Greece in the Bronze Age was for many years a standard in the field.'' Dr. Vermeule (pronounced ver-MULE) became widely recognized as an expert on Mycenaean culture, which flourished from about 1580 to 1120 B.C.         Emily Dickinson Townsend Vermeule was born on Aug. 11, 1928, in New York City. Named for her grandmother, a relative of the poet Emily Dickinson, she graduated from the Brearley School and in 1950 received her bachelor's degree summa cum laude in Greek and philosophy from Bryn Mawr.         Dr. Vermeule earned a master's degree in classical archaeology from Radcliffe in 1954 and a Ph.D. in Greek from Bryn Mawr in 1956.         Her teaching career led her from Bryn Mawr to Wellesley to Boston University to Harvard. From 1970 until her retirement in 1994, Dr. Vermeule was the Samuel Zemurray Jr. and Doris Zemurray-Stone Radcliffe Professor at Harvard, teaching in both the classics and the history of art and architecture departments.         Her books include ''Greece in the Bronze Age'' (1964), which focused on Mycenaean culture; ''Aspects of Death in Early Greek Art and Poetry'' (1979), which won the Philological Association's Charles J. Goodwin Award of Merit; and ''Mycenaean Pictorial Vase Painting'' (1982).         In addition to her son, of Chicago, Dr. Vermeule is survived by her husband, the archaeologist Cornelius Clarkson Vermeule III of Cambridge, and a daughter, Blakey Vermeule of Chicago.       
         Miné Okubo, a Japanese-American artist who recorded in 2,000 drawings and a book what she saw and felt as an internee in American detention camps for Japanese and Japanese-Americans during World War II, died on Feb. 10 in Manhattan. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Okubo, who pronounced her first name mee-neh, was one of 110,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans living in Western states who were evacuated from their homes early in 1942. They were interned by the federal government as a precautionary measure, a move that has been much criticized. Two-thirds of the internees were, like her, American citizens.         She was born to Japanese immigrant parents in Riverside, Calif. Her father worked as a gardener. She received a master's degree in art from the University of California at Berkeley. In 1938 she was awarded a fellowship to study and travel in Europe, but World War II cut short her stay.         Early in the 1940's, she was employed by the Works Progress Administration in San Francisco. While the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera stood on scaffolding and painted murals, she was below, explaining his work to onlookers.         The Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 changed her life painfully for two years. Other members of her family were also interned.         ''Nothing had been prepared or planned for this rushed and forced evacuation,'' she wrote in 1983 in a new edition of her book, ''Citizen 13660'' (University of Washington Press), which originally appeared in 1946. ''There were untold hardships, sadness, and misery.''         She and her brother Toku were sent to an ''assembly center'' in San Bruno, Calif. There they had to live for almost half a year in what had been a horse stall. Later they were sent to ''protective custody'' in the Topaz Relocation Center in the Utah desert. She spent the rest of the two years there and then was released.         ''Because of the injustices and contradictions nothing made much sense'' in the camps, she wrote in 1983, but in them she had the opportunity ''to see what happens to people when reduced to one status and condition. Cameras and photographs were not permitted in the camps, so I recorded everything in sketches, drawings and paintings.'' In a 1947 interview, she said that at the Topaz camp, ''You had to work hard to keep yourself going, and to keep from thinking.''         She sent a drawing of a Topaz guard to an art show in San Francisco. It won a prize, which led to assignments from Fortune magazine to illustrate articles. This freed her from Topaz and brought her to Manhattan, where she made her home until her death.         ''Citizen 13660,'' containing text and 206 drawings, won praise when it appeared. The book was named for the number Miss Okubo was given as an internee. ''The number was on suitcases and everything you owned, all the papers you signed,'' she recalled. ''You became a number.''         She wrote in 1983 that the book had begun ''as a special group of drawings made to tell the story of camp life for my many friends who faithfully sent letters and packages to let us know we were not forgotten.''         A review in The New York Times Book Review in 1946 said: ''In a remarkably objective and vivid and even humorous account,'' Miss Okubo told the whole story of her internment ''in dramatic and detailed drawings and brief text.''         ''The drawings reveal a two-way process at work,'' the review said, ''the gradual demoralization of a group where family ties had ceased to matter under the system of mass living and mass feeding, and the resourcefulness and resilience of these fellow-Americans who tried desperately to turn negative living into something positive.''         After moving to Manhattan, Ms. Okubo did freelance illustration and then resumed painting full time. Her work appeared in solo and group exhibitions at museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.         She is survived by a sister, Yoshi Tanaka of Fallbrook, Calif.       
         Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the lyrical author and aviator whose marriage to Charles A. Lindbergh brought her both joy and tragedy, died yesterday at her home in Passumpsic, Vt. She was 94.         Their daughter Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her 1998 memoir ''Under a Wing'' (Simon & Schuster) that her mother had suffered adverse effects from her advancing age and from strokes and was ''often confused in her mind, and in fragile health.''         Anne Morrow Lindbergh scored an immense literary success in midlife with her 1955 book ''Gift From the Sea'' ( Pantheon), which was a philosophical meditation on women's lives in this century. It was on the nonfiction best-seller list of The New York Times for 80 weeks and was No. 1 for 47 of those weeks. In the book's first 20 years in print, more than five million copies were sold in hard-cover and paperback editions.         Mrs. Lindbergh was the author of more than two dozen books of prose and poetry, including five volumes of diaries; her work was often acclaimed by critics and popular with readers. Despite the literary distinction that she achieved, her life was largely shaped by two dramatic experiences when she was in her 20's. One was blissful, one was anguished. They were reflected in the title of a volume of her diaries: ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead'' (1973, Harcourt, Brace).         The first experience came in 1927 when Anne Morrow, then a 21-year-old senior at Smith College, arrived for the Christmas holidays in Mexico City, where her well-to-do father, Dwight W. Morrow, was the American ambassador.         'He Is Taller Than Anyone Else'         There she met Charles Lindbergh, whose courageous solo flight across the Atlantic had made him a hero of mythic proportions and the most famous man in the world. He was staying with her family, and the sight of the boyish aviator tugged at her heartstrings.         ''He is taller than anyone else,'' she wrote in her diary. ''You see his head in a moving crowd, and you notice his glance, where it turns, as though it were keener, clearer and brighter than anyone else's, lit with a more intense fire. What could I say to this boy? Anything I might say would be trivial and superficial, like pink frosting flowers. I felt the whole world before this to be frivolous, superficial, ephemeral.''         Two years later the man known as Lucky Lindy married the shy, literary Miss Morrow. The glamorous Lindberghs were seldom out of the news as they made pioneering flights to Latin America and Asia, becoming ''the First Couple of the Skies.'' As the critic Alfred Kazin observed, ''To millions around the world -- reading of the Lindberghs flying everywhere in their own Lockheed Sirius seaplane, looking at photographs of the 'perfect'-looking couple ('the Lone Eagle and his mate') landing in Siberia, China, Japan -- the Lindberghs seemed to enjoy the greatest possible good fortune that a young couple could have.''         But that second experience came four years later, on the evening of March 1, 1932, in Hopewell, N.J., where the Lindberghs were at home with their 20-month-old son, Charles Jr., and a nurse, Betty Gow. The nurse looked in now and then on Charlie as he slept in his crib.         ''At 10 Betty went in to the baby, shut the window, then lit the electric stove, then turned to the bed; it was empty, and the sides still up,'' Mrs. Lindbergh wrote later in a letter to her mother-in-law. At first Miss Gow  thought Lindbergh had taken his son from the crib for a joke, Mrs. Lindbergh continued, adding poignantly, ''I did, until I saw his face.'' Lindbergh, looking down at his diminutive wife, said, ''Anne, they have stolen our baby.''         The Lindberghs were soon enveloped in the horror of the kidnapping, the discovery of the child's body on May 12, more than 10 weeks later, and the subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a carpenter, for Charlie's murder in 1936.         They had always been ''intensely private persons with an austere, restrained, glowingly creative sense of life,'' Mr. Kazin wrote. Both had a fear of crowds and nothing, even Lindbergh's 1927 landing in Paris, had prepared them for the carnival of reporters, photographers, con artists, curiosity-seekers, vandals and  crazy people who had invaded their lives after their baby was kidnapped. Americans would not experience a similar flood of publicity until the O. J. Simpson murder trial of the 1990's.         The Literary Career She Always Wanted         Mrs. Lindbergh would never get over her child's death but she went on to bear five more children and to have the literary career she had dreamed of. The historian Geoffrey C. Ward wrote in 1998 that '''Gift From the Sea' became a source of inspiration for a whole generation of wives and mothers -- 'the great vacationless class,' she called them -- who, like herself, were beginning to search for more fulfilling lives once their children had grown and moved away.''         Mrs. Lindbergh echoed many women's concerns with observations like this: ''What a circus act we women perform every day of our lives. Look at us. We run a tightrope daily, balancing a pile of books on the head. Baby-carriage, parasol, kitchen chair, still under control. Steady now! This is not the life of simplicity but the life of multiplicity that the wise men warn us of. It leads not to unification but to fragmentation. It does not bring grace; it destroys the soul.''         Lewis Gannett wrote that her 1938 best seller, ''Listen! The Wind,'' had ''caught the poetry of flight in a web of words as no other book on flying has yet contrived to do.'' Alfred Kazin admired her as ''a lyricist of action.''         Millions of Americans respected  Mrs. Lindbergh,too. The readers of Good Housekeeping magazine voted her one of their 10 most admired women in 1975, when she was 69 and had a flock of grandchildren . This admiration was expressed over and over during her long life -- notably by letter-writers at the time of the kidnapping. And after the poet John Ciardi reviewed ''The Unicorn and Other Poems'' (Random House) in The Saturday Review and called her poetry ''inept, jingling, slovenly, illiterate,'' the magazine was soon rocked by what its editor, Norman Cousins, called ''the biggest storm of reader protest in our 33-year history'' -- most of it from Mrs. Lindbergh's female admirers.         The respect for Mrs. Lindbergh also survived bitter controversy over her 1940 book ''The Wave of the Future,'' a short, hazy manifesto, written while World War II raged in Europe. She wrote that she did not endorse communism or fascism, but that she saw them as inevitable effects of what she called the ''wave of the future.'' She also said she hoped the United States could avoid entering the conflict. And, in a letter, she wrote that she was beginning to feel that Hitler was ''a very great man, like an inspired religious leader -- and as such rather fanatical -- but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power.''         'Both Very Blind In the Beginning         ''The Wave of the Future'' was widely criticized when it appeared. Rabbi Abraham D. Shaw of Baltimore, for example, said in a speech in 1941 to a gathering of the Union of American of American Hebrew Congregations that it was the epitome of defeatism, and that in it Mrs. Lindbergh had counseled surrender to what he called the ''anti-religious, anti-ethical hordes.''         In later years, Walter S. Ross wrote in his 1967 biography ''The Last Hero: Charles A. Lindbergh'' that the book ''took so astral a view of the world that it made the crimes of the Nazis seem to bulk no larger than the inadequacies'' of the democracies.'' Some friends said they thought Mrs. Lindbergh had written the book at least partly to please her husband, who at that time was an ardent advocate of the United States' staying out of the war.         Mrs. Lindbergh herself later acknowledged that she and her husband had been ''both very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst evils of the Nazi system.'' But she said that she had warned him that he would offend many Americans with an isolationist speech that he prepared to give in September 1941 in Des Moines, in which he warned Jews of retribution for being among the leading ''war agitators'' along with the British and the Roosevelt Administration. Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her book that years later her mother told her: ''If only he had listened to me. I told him what would happen if he listed 'interventionist' groups in that way . . . 'the British,' 'the Roosevelt Administration,' and 'the Jews.' I told him he would be called anti-Semitic.''         Mrs. Lindbergh recalled that he replied, ''But I'm not!'' and that she said: '' 'It doesn't matter. That's what will happen.' But he didn't believe me.''         When he gave the speech, he said: ''The leaders of both the British and Jewish races, for reasons which are understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war. We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own interests, but we also must look out for ours. We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to lead our country to destruction.''         Later Mrs. Lindbergh wrote in her diary: ''He is attacked on all sides, Administration, pressure groups, and Jews, as now openly a Nazi, following a Nazi doctrine.''         In her diary volume called ''War Within and Without'' (1980), she said she experienced a ''profound feeling of grief'' over what her husband had said and decided it was ''at best unconsciously a bid for anti-Semitism. It is a match lit near a pile of excelsior.''         Some friends said that the above-the-battle stance that she evidenced in ''The Last Wave'' and in other writing -- her diaries during the mid-'30's made scant mention of the large political and social questions of the day -- was a reflection, in part, of her privileged, sheltered upbringing.         Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906, in Englewood, N.J. Her father became a multimillionaire partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company, who went on to become a Republican Senator from New Jersey. Her mother was Elizabeth Reeve Cutter Morrow, an educator and poet who was Smith College's acting president in 1939 and 1940 and who publicly criticized her daughter and son-in-law for their America First views.         Young Anne attended Miss Chapin's School in Manhattan, where her family maintained an apartment, and went on to Smith, where she won two literary prizes before she graduated in 1928. When she met Lindbergh, she was an intensely shy and romantic woman, only a bit over 5 feet tall, with grave blue eyes and a demure, schoolgirlish manner.         ''To be deeply in love is, of course, a great liberating force,'' she observed in the introduction to ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead.'' ''The sheer fact of finding myself loved was unbelievable and changed my world, my feelings about life and myself. I was given confidence, strength and almost a new character. The man I was to marry believed in me and what I could do, and consequently I found I could do more than I realized, even in that mysterious outer world that fascinated me but seemed unattainable. He opened the door to 'real life,' and though it frightened me, it also beckoned. I had to go.''         Mrs. Lindbergh wrote that before her marriage she had seen her husband-to-be more or less as ''a knight in shining armor, with myself as his devoted page.''         Was this a good basis for marriage? ''Hardly,'' she concluded. ''But it was a role I could play until I grew up. It was not a bad beginning.''         In 1929 the young couple were wed in a simple Protestant service in the drawing room of the Morrow family's hilltop manor in Englewood.  Just before the wedding began, Lindbergh strode out into the garden and picked a bouquet of larkspur and columbine for his bride to carry. Their marriage was the lead story on the front page of The New York Times and newspapers all over the world.         For their honeymoon the couple cruised to Maine in Lindbergh's motor launch, and the traveling continued in the first years of their marriage. Mrs. Lindbergh went with her husband, who was active in commercial aviation and scientific research, on many aerial journeys to Europe, to Asia, and to the Caribbean, where he was charting airplane routes.         She learned to navigate, to operate a radio, to pilot a plane. In 1930 she became the first woman to get a glider pilot's license in the United States. That same year she was co-pilot and navigator when her husband broke the transatlantic speed record. In 1934 she became the first woman to to receive the Hubbard Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society. Her first book, ''North to the Orient'' (Harcourt Brace), which became a best seller in 1935, was an account of one of their aerial voyages.         After living in a farmhouse in Princeton, the Lindberghs moved into a house that they had built on a 400-acre tract of land in the remote borough of Hopewell, near Trenton. It was there that their child was kidnapped. ''Everything is telescoped now into one moment, one of those eternal moments -- the moment when I realized that the baby had been taken,'' she wrote in her diary. In that ''first flash of horror,'' she wrote, she had seen in her mind's eye ''the baby dead, killed violently.''         ''Everything since then has been unreal,'' she continued. ''It has all vanished like smoke. Only that eternal moment remains. I feel strangely a sense of peace -- not peace, but an end to restlessness, a finality, as though I were sleeping in a grave.''         The hysteria and confusion attached to ''the Crime of the Century''  included weeks of negotiation with the kidnapper, the unavailing delivery of $50,000 in ransom money at a Bronx cemetery and many sensations and false leads. The baby's body was discovered in some nearby woods; he had been killed by a blow on the head soon after the kidnapping. Eventually, Mr. Hauptmann was traced through a banknote that had been part of the ransom. He was put on trial in Flemington, N.J., and Mrs. Lindbergh went on the witness stand for the prosecution to identify a flannel shirt -- made from an old petticoat of hers -- that had been found on the murdered baby. Tears brimmed in her eyes, but she never lost her composure.         After the trial, the Lindberghs tried to go on living in the United States, but there were threats on the life of their second child, a son named Jon, who was born on Aug. 16, 1932, and other harassments, largely from cranks and aggressive reporters. Late in 1935 the Lindberghs moved to England to seek escape from what Lindbergh called the ''tremendous public hysteria'' that surrounded him in the United States. On May 12, 1937, their third child, a boy named Land was born in a London nursing home, where Mrs. Lindbergh had registered under an assumed name.         She accompanied her husband on his visits to aviation-industry plants in France and in Nazi Germany. But she was not present at a stag dinner in 1938 at the American Embassy in Berlin, when Hermann Göring, whom Hitler had named Air Minister in 1933, presented Lindbergh with a high German decoration.         Mr. Ross, the Lindbergh biographer, wrote that when, after the dinner, Lindbergh showed the medal-box to his wife, ''she opened it and glanced at the medal and looked away. Then she said, without the slightest trace of emotion, 'the Albatross.''' She was right. Lindbergh was widely criticized in the United States for having accepted a medal from the Nazi Government.         In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the Lindberghs moved back to the United States, where Lindbergh's isolationist pronouncements made him widely unpopular. Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband to gatherings of isolationists and did not take public exception to his views. She said later that he had been ''used'' by the Nazis but that he had been genuinely ''astonished and impressed by the rapid growth of German air power,'' while also recognizing the danger it posed.         A. Scott Berg's 1998 biography of her husband, ''Lindbergh'' (Putnam), which drew on previously inaccessible family papers provided by Mrs. Lindbergh, showed that she was more aware of the flaws in Charles Lindbergh's character than had been thought. Mr. Berg reported problems in Mrs. Lindbergh's marriage that were painful for her, among them her husband's frequent absences, his bossiness, argumentativeness and emotional remoteness. After the birth of each of their six children, Mr. Berg wrote, Lindbergh would take his wife away on long plane journeys, some lasting weeks, as a way of ''weaning'' her from her children. He was angry at her displays of emotion (even after the kidnapping and murder of their child), and he would scold her if she complained she was having trouble with her writing.         Summing up, Mr. Berg wrote that the couple's relationship was ''a complex case history of control and repression, filled with joy and passion and grief and rage.'' He said in a 1998 interview that there was no doubt that Lindbergh ''deeply loved his wife and children, but that love manifested itself in unusual ways. It's ironic that it was Lindbergh who fostered his own wife's feminism. He very much wanted her to stand on her own two feet and, in helping her do so, created so much independence that it almost separated them.''         Falling in Love With Other Men         In the summer of 1939, Mr. Berg wrote, Mrs. Lindbergh, ''living less with Charles than through him, only knew that she was feeling incomplete and unfulfilled -- and mildly depressed.'' And then she, ''most unexpectedly, found inspiration, and even more, as she fell in love with another man.'' The man was Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the renowned French aviator-author, who visited the Lindberghs at their house in Lloyd Neck, N.Y. Mrs. Lindbergh and Saint-Exupéry talked in French, just the two of them, for hours. She was thrilled and bewitched when he spoke to her about her writing.         But she did not leave her husband for Saint-Exupéry, who already had both a wife and a paramour. He vanished in 1944 on a reconnaissance mission.         Charles Lindbergh's abhorrence of any display of emotion or weakness took a toll on his family. Mrs. Lindbergh suffered from depression and in defiance of her husband had daily psychotherapy sessions for a time, wrote Susan Hertog, a freelance journalist and photographer, in her biography ''Anne Morrow Lindbergh'' (Doubleday, 1999).         In ''Lindbergh'' Mr. Berg wrote that she became close to Dr. Dana W. Atchley, an internist affiliated with Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, who also had a difficult marriage. ''The friendship of these two longing souls blossomed into a love affair in 1956,'' Mr. Berg wrote, ''and continued for the next few years.''         Mrs. Lindbergh discussed with friends the possibility of a divorce, Mr. Berg reported, but she realized that she did not want one.         They continued to lead lives that were largely sheltered and secretive until Charles Lindbergh, suffering from cancer, died in 1974 at age 72 on the Hawaiian island of Maui. He and his wife were married for 45 years and it was the only enduring relationship of his life. In her later years Mrs. Lindbergh spent much of her time in her secluded house in Darien, Conn., where she edited her diaries and letters for publication. Mrs. Lindbergh's elder daughter, Anne Spencer Lindbergh, who was also a writer, died in 1993. In addition to her daughter Reeve, Mrs. Lindbergh  is survived by her sons Jon, Land and Scott.         Reeve Lindbergh had a baby son who died in 1985 at almost exactly the same age as Anne Morrow Lindbergh's firstborn. Reeve's baby was known as Jonny, and she wrote in her book: ''Jonny too died in the night, and I, like my mother before me, was apart from my son during his last moments. I too thought that the baby was safely asleep in his crib.''         Jonny's death, while he and his mother were staying with Anne Morrow Lindbergh in Connecticut, was caused by ''a seizure related to infant encephalitis,'' his mother wrote. When she went to wake him the next morning, he was dead. His body was already stiff and blue.         Reeve recalled that she and her mother made the necessary emergency telephone calls, and ''Then, because she insisted upon it, my mother and I went and sat together with Jonny's body, in two chairs, next to the crib where he had gone to sleep the night before.''         As they sat, Anne Morrow Lindbergh said: ''I never saw my child's body after he died. I never sat with my son this way.''         Seeking Balance Between Solitude and Communion         Here are some excerpts from Anne Morrow Lindbergh's books ''North to the Orient'' and ''Gift From the Sea'':         All afternoon we had flown over miles and miles of perfectly flat treeless land, mottled with lakes and marshes. Toward evening we came upon a gray glassy lake, bounded by gray bleak shores a little higher than the marshes. And on shore, the only points of accent in that monotonous landscape, stood three or four white houses. This was Baker Lake. We circled over the flagpole . . . the church steeple, and cut across the dull satin water of the lake to the little group of people on shore. As we pushed near the sandy bank I had a closer view of the land, gray again -- no trees, no hills, nothing but gray moss, gray water, and a gray sky. How could anything live there, even animals? For this was the trading post. . . .         My husband switched off the motor. The propeller clicked around idly and stopped. There was no noise except the lapping of our wash against the sand. The group of men on shore, a few white men, and Eskimos in pointed Santa Claus hoods, came forward. The Canadian mounted officer, tall and handsome in his red coat, put out a hand to us. ''We've reserved tickets for the show tonight. I hope you'll come!''         ''What's that?'' said my husband, not knowing whether to laugh or not, as he looked at the four lone houses. Great guffaws from the group.         When I jumped out, the three or four Eskimos drew back. Then two little Eskimo boys came up shyly and followed me about. Their bright eyes shone under their caps as they searched my face and costume curiously.         ''You see,'' explained one of the traders, ''you're the first white woman they've ever seen. There's never been one here before.''  -- From ''North to the Orient''  (1935, Harcourt, Brace)         To be a woman is to have interests and duties, raying out in all directions from the central mother-core, like spokes from the hub of a wheel. The pattern of our lives is essentially circular. We must be open to all points of the compass: husband, children, friends, home, community; stretched out, exposed, sensitive like a spider's web to each breeze that blows, to each call that comes. How difficult for us, then, to achieve a balance in the midst of these contradictory tensions, and yet how necessary for the proper functioning of our lives. How much we need, and how arduous of attainment is that steadiness preached in all rules for holy living. How desirable and how distant is the ideal of the contemplative, artist, or saint -- the inner inviolable core, the single eye.         With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in general run counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel.         What is the answer? There is no easy answer, no complete answer. I have only clues, shells from the sea. The bare beauty of the channelled whelk tells me that one answer, and perhaps a first step, is in simplification of life, in cutting out some of the distractions. But how? Total retirement is not possible, I cannot shed my responsiblities. I cannot permanently inhabit a desert island. I cannot be a nun in the midst of family life. I would not want to be. The solution for me, surely, is neither in total renunciation of the world, nor in total acceptance of it. I must find a balance somewhere, or an alternating rhythm between these two extremes; a swinging of the pendulum between solitude and communion, between retreat and return. In my periods of retreat, perhaps I can learn something to carry back into my worldly life. I can at least practice for these two weeks the simplification of outward life, as a beginning.  -- From ''Gift From the Sea''  (1955, Pantheon)       
         Dale Evans, who won the hearts of millions of Americans as she rode alongside her husband, Roy Rogers, in western films and on ''The Roy Rogers Show'' in the early years of television, died yesterday at her home in Apple Valley, Calif., east of Los Angeles. She was 88.         Miss Evans had not been on a horse since childhood and her hopes for a Hollywood career were sputtering when she was cast opposite John Wayne in her first Western, ''In Old Oklahoma,'' in 1944. She went on to become an accomplished sound-stage equestrienne, playing opposite rugged, handsome and likable cowboys in dozens of Westerns before she met and married Rogers, the King of the Cowboys, and composed the couple's enduring theme song, ''Happy Trails to You.''         By the 1950's she was a fixture on the sagebrush-epic landscape of snarling men, delicate ladies and roaring oil gushers. And with the dawn of television, she became a fixture in the minds of millions of children who tuned in to ''The Roy Rogers Show'' and saw her moseying  along on her buckskin horse, Buttermilk, while Rogers rode his beloved golden palomino, Trigger, the Smartest Horse in the Movies.         Miss Evans's break had come years earlier, while she was working as a $12-a-week stenographer in Dallas. While she was transcribing a letter, her boss suggested that she appear on a radio program that the company was sponsoring . She did, and soon was singing on regional radio hookups. By 1940 she was the featured performer on a CBS radio network program, ''News and Rhythm,'' and was heard on the Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy program.         She was also appearing at the Gay Paree supper club in Chicago, where her showstopper was ''Will You Marry Me, Mr. Larramie?''         One night an agent offered not marriage but a screen test, opposite Bing Crosby in ''Holiday Inn.'' She did not get the part in the film, which also starred Fred Astaire and featured such Irving Berlin hits as ''White Christmas.'' But 20th Century-Fox signed her to a one-year contract.         She moved to Republic in 1943 and was cast opposite Wayne in ''In Old Oklahoma'' (it was later retitled ''The War of the Wildcats''), a romance about a swaggering, no-nonsense oil driller. The following year, she was cast in ''The Cowboy and the Señorita.''         The cowboy was Roy Rogers, a rugged, handsome and likable man but, by his own account, ''no great shakes'' as a talker.         Miss Evans was no señorita -- at the time, she was married to her second husband, Robert Dale Butts, a pianist. They divorced in 1945, and the following year, Rogers's wife died after giving birth to a son, Roy Rogers Jr.         Miss Evans and Rogers made eight films together in 1946, including ''My Pal Trigger.'' She admitted to having trouble with Trigger: she made the mistake of patting his neck.         ''He is a very highly cued horse,'' she said. ''He is cued to rear when you touch that spot on his neck. He stood straight up on his hind legs. I slipped off that dish I was sitting on, and fell flat on my -- I fell off in the dust.''         Her fans complained that Rogers seemed to care more about Trigger than he cared about her. ''How that spurious cowhand can be content to kiss a horse when he has Miss Evans on the lot every day I cannot imagine,'' Robert C. Ruark wrote in The World-Telegram in 1946, ''but the inflexible law of westerns is that the hero shall never smooch the heroine.''         Once, she said, he came close.  ''They were going to let Roy kiss me on the forehead'' in one film -- she said she could not remember which. The idea was to show that he was sorry for pushing her under a bed to keep her from getting hurt in a rough-and-tumble scene. ''But they had a conference and decided against it,'' she said. ''The kids, you know, so I never even got kissed on the forehead. I just get knocked under beds.''         Miss Evans wore outfits of fringes, satins and studs that were every bit as sartorially splendid as those sported by her husband. Thousands and thousands of red-blooded American girls wore Dale Evans outfits and cast-iron six shooters in their matching holster sets as a kind of proto-feminist reach for equality with their brothers.         Dale Evans -- born Frances Octavia Smith on Oct. 31, 1912, in Uvalde, Tex. -- once said that her favorite role was Toni Ames, a newspaperwoman in ''Don't Fence Me In,'' which was released in 1945. ''I like to be active in a role, and hate namby-pamby heroines,'' she said. ''Toni was a pleasant departure from the usual western role, in which the girl just stands around while men do violent and admirable things.''         Miss Evans appeared in the 1950's with the evangelist Billy Graham, and in the 1960's she joined a group of other actors in pressing for a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public schools.         She also began writing inspirational books like ''Angel Unaware'' (Revell, 1953) the story of her daughter Robin, who was born in 1950 with Down syndrome and heart problems and died a few days before her second birthday. ''Angel Unaware'' sold 400,000 copies in two years; Miss Evans gave the profits to the National Association for Retarded Children.         Contrary to common practice at the time, when such children were institutionalized, and contrary to Hollywood myth making, in which fans were not to know that perfect couples sometimes had imperfect children, Miss Evans and Rogers had kept Robin, who was their first child, at home with the family.         It was a large family from the start. Rogers had been a widower with three children, an adopted daughter named Cheryl, a son, Roy  Jr., and another daughter, Linda Lou, and Miss Evans had a son, Thomas Frederick Fox Jr., from an earlier marriage that she had entered into when she was 14. To help them overcome their grief over the death of Robin, the couple adopted a Korean War orphan they named Deborah Lee.         On Aug. 17, 1964, Deborah Lee, then 12 years old, was killed in a church bus-car collision near Oceanside, Calif. The following year, John David (Sandy) Rogers, an abused child whom they adopted after one of their many goodwill visits to an orphanage, choked to death in a military hospital in Germany. An 18-year-old Army private, he had complained of feeling ill after dining at an enlisted men's club. After he died, Miss Evans wrote a book, ''Salute to Sandy.''         They also raised a foster child from Scotland, Marion Fleming, and a Choctaw Indian child, Mary Little Doe, called Dodie.         Roy Rogers died in 1998 at age 86.         Roy Rogers Jr. runs the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum in Victorville, Calif., at the edge of the Mojave Desert and seven miles from the Rogers-Evans ranch, named the Double-R Bar Ranch like the one in their television series.         There, amid all the memorabilia of a time in America when the good guys were polite singing cowboys who wore white hats and fought fairly and never cussed, is a glass case holding a stuffed Trigger, together with Miss Evans's horse Buttermilk and the couple's German shepherd, Bullet.         At the peak of their popularity in the late 1940's and early 50's, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had more than 2,000 fan clubs around the world and hundreds of licensed products from lunchboxes to comic books bore their names and faces.         Their rodeo set a box-office record at Madison Square Garden and they were the only couple to be chosen grand marshals of the annual Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, Calif.         Miss Evans had almost as many credits for songwriting as she did for acting. She wrote or composed more than 25 songs, including ''Aha, San Antone,'' which sold more than 200,000 copies, and ''The Bible Tells Me So.'' She made 30 children's records, . including one that featured her own songs, ''Happy Birthday, Gentle Savior.''         ''I would love to be an evangelist,'' Miss Evans said, ''but I think God has revealed to me that I can serve him best by just remaining at my post.''         Correction:  February 10, 2001, Saturday  An obituary of the film and television star Dale Evans on Thursday  misstated the name of the Chicago supper club where she performed in the early 1940's. It was Chez Paree, not Gay Paree.       
         Debra E. Bernhardt, a labor historian who spearheaded a successful three-year drive to obtain landmark status for Union Square Park in Manhattan, died on Thursday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, said her sister, Andra Bernhardt Ladd.         The head of the Tamiment Library and the Robert F. Wagner Labor Archives at New York University, Dr. Bernhardt devoted her career to documenting the lives of the largely unsung men and women who built New York City and, day in and day out, nudged it along: sandhogs and seamstresses, pipe fitters and child welfare workers, secretaries and short-order cooks.         She was the author, with Rachel Bernstein, of ''Ordinary People, Extraordinary Lives'' (New York University Press, 2000), a book of photographs and oral histories of working New Yorkers that grew out of an exhibition of the same name at the Museum of the City of New York.         At her death, Dr. Bernhardt was at work on Labor Arts, a Web site devoted to the art and artifacts of working people, scheduled to make its debut in May.         As a public historian, Dr. Bernhardt immersed herself in the kinds of workaday narratives that traditional academic historians, with their eyes trained on the powerful, often overlook. She described her work as ''documenting the undocumented,'' a phrase that neatly encapsulated the particular challenge of public history: how to chronicle the lives of people not in the habit of generating collections of personal papers, boxed and ready for posterity.         But what these people did have was stuff -- leaflets, lapel buttons, picket signs and photographs -- and part of Dr. Bernhardt's job was to persuade them that each of these dusty artifacts was a window on a bygone union election, organizing drive or strike; she would acquire many of them for the Tamiment Library, a research collection devoted to radical movements in the United States from the Civil War onward, as well as for the Wagner Archives, dedicated to labor studies.         ''The dustbin of history is lighter because of her,'' said Miriam Frank, a colleague at N.Y.U.         Debra Ellen Bernhardt was born on May 9, 1953, in Nuremberg, West Germany, where her parents were civilian employees of the United States Army; she was raised in Iron River, Mich., where several members of her Danish-American family worked in the iron mines. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Michigan, a master's from Wayne State University and, in 1988, one of the first doctorates from N.Y.U. in public history.         In conjunction with her dissertation, she produced ''New Yorkers at Work,'' an eight-part series broadcast on National Public Radio. In 1995, Dr. Bernhardt received the John Commerford Award, the highest honor of the New York Labor History Association, and, this year, the Distinguished Service Award from the New York City Central Labor Council.         Dr. Bernhardt is survived by her sister, of Lafayette, La.; her parents, Harold and Marcia Bernhardt, of Iron River; and by her husband, Jonathan Bloom, and her children, Alexander and Sonia, all of Brooklyn.         Despite her professional prominence, Dr. Bernhardt remained intensely proud of her own working-class roots. She sang in the New York City Labor Chorus; her business cards bore the logo of the union shop that printed them, as did her son's bar mitzvah invitations. She was known to her friends as Debs -- shorthand not only for Debra, but also for Eugene V.         And it was largely as a result of Dr. Bernhardt's efforts that in September 1998, Union Square Park was declared a national historic landmark by the National Park Service. The square was the cradle of American labor history -- a perennial home to anarchists, Communists, socialists, unionists and assorted rabble-rousing orators, and the site, in 1882, of what was later recognized as the first Labor Day parade.         ''No one realizes that the eight-hour day was won by working people on these streets, in this park,'' Dr. Bernhardt told The New York Times in 1998, as she sat in Union Square, once ringed by union halls and threadbare left-wing publishers and now by upscale restaurants and chain retailers. ''We wanted to celebrate the fact that ordinary people were able to express their rights to free speech and assembly on this spot.''       
         Maria Karnilova, a charter member of American Ballet Theater who channeled her comic gifts and vitality as a dancer into an award-winning career as an actress on Broadway, died on Friday in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.         A versatile performer, Ms. Karnilova won a Tony Award in 1964 when she portrayed Golde, opposite Zero Mostel as Teyve, in ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' She was also nominated for a Tony for her role as Hortense in ''Zorba'' in 1968 and was praised for her hilarious performance in 1959 as Tessie Tura, a stripper in ''Gypsy.'' She played Golde again in the 1981 revival of ''Fiddler.''         Ms. Karnilova's career after 1946 was focused on Broadway and television as well as opera and regional stage productions. From the 1940's through the 60's, these included ''Miss Liberty,'' ''Two's Company,'' ''The Beggar's Opera,'' ''Kaleidoscope'' and ''Bravo Giovanni.'' Nonetheless, she often spoke of ballet as her first love. ''There is nothing more wonderful than being onstage,'' she once said of dancing.         She started her professional career in 1927 in the Children's Ballet of the Metropolitan Opera and joined the corps when Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, was founded in 1939. As a soloist, she excelled  in comic ballets like Antony Tudor's ''Judgment of Paris,'' Michel Fokine's ''Bluebeard,'' David Lichine's ''Helen of Troy'' and Agnes de Mille's ''Three Virgins and a Devil.''         Ms. Karnilova was occasionally seen in classical solos, as in ''Aurora's Wedding,'' the last act of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' and in Tudor's dance dramas. (She was the former mistress in his ''Jardin aux Lilas.'')         In 1943, John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, noted that she was originally listed in programs as Maria Karniloff but was now called Karnilova. Whatever her stage name, he was taken with her vibrant personality. When she portrayed the sixth wife in ''Bluebeard,'' he wrote, ''She dances the role excellently and plays it with charm and a nice comedy sense.''         When she was cast in the mime role of Giselle's mother in 1944, Mr. Martin wrote, ''Who should turn up but Maria Karnilova, of all people, playing delightfully and obviously having the time of her life.''         Ms. Karnilova was a soloist when she left Ballet Theater in 1946 to appear in ''Call Me Mister,'' a Broadway revue, and a series of musicals, many directed or choreographed by Jerome Robbins, a close friend from her corps days at Ballet Theater. In 1958-59, she appeared as a guest in ''The Concert'' in Robbins's short-lived troupe, Ballets: U.S.A.         Ms. Karnilova was born in Hartford on Aug. 3, 1920, to Russian parents, Phillip Dovgolenko and Stephanida Karnilovich Dovgolenko. After the family moved to Brooklyn, Mr. Dovgolenko went to the box office of Loews State, a movie house in Manhattan, and asked where his daughter could take ballet lessons. The cashier pointed to the Metropolitan Opera House, then on West 39th Street. Ms. Karnilova began studying with Margaret Curtis at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School and trained later with Fokine, Tudor, Edward Caton and Anton Dolin.         After appearing in small groups headed by Fokine and Mikhail Mordkin, whose company was the nucleus of Ballet Theater, she danced with the Salmaggi Opera at the Hippodrome in New York and in ''Stars in Your Eyes,'' a Broadway musical. She then joined Ballet Theater and later appeared there as a guest in 1955-56 and in 1959. She was the ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera Company in the 1952-53 season.         Ms. Karnilova met her husband, the actor George S. Irving, in the cast of ''Call Me Mister'' and married him in 1948. He survives her, along with a son, Alexander of Oceanside, Calif.; a daughter, Katherine Irving Stark of South Salem, N.Y.; and three grandchildren.       
         Beatrice Straight, a graceful and versatile actress who won both an Oscar and a Tony Award, died on Saturday in North Ridge, Calif. She was 86 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif., for most of the last 10 years.         Because she came from a wealthy  family, the Whitneys (her mother was Dorothy Payne Whitney), she never had to act for a living but was dedicated to the art of theater. When she became successful, she continued to choose roles for their challenges rather than for their ability to further her career.         Onstage and in films, Ms. Straight projected an image that was dignified but with strong emotional undercurrents. She brought believability to whatever role she undertook, acting in classics as well as contemporary plays and movies.         In the original Broadway production of Arthur Miller's ''Crucible'' in 1953, she was the essence of Elizabeth Proctor. Reviewing the play in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said that both Ms. Straight and her co-star, Arthur Kennedy, were superb, adding that in performance, she was ''reserved, detached, above and beyond the contention.'' That role earned her a Tony as best supporting actress.         In 1977 she won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for her performance in Sidney Lumet's ''Network'' as the wife William Holden's character spurns. The role was brief but noticeable, behind the dramatic fireworks, a familiar place for Ms. Straight.         She had a variety of roles in plays by Shakespeare, Shaw, Chekhov, Ibsen and Tennessee Williams. In 1982 she scored another film success in ''Poltergeist'' as a psychologist moonlighting as a parapsychologist.         Beatrice Whitney Straight was born in Old Westbury, N.Y. Her father, Willard Dickerman Straight, was a banker and former official in the State Department. She attended the Lincoln School in New York and Dartington Hall Community in Devonshire, England, a school founded by her mother and stepfather, Leonard Elmhirst.         She made her Broadway debut in 1935 in ''Bitter Oleander.'' After she persuaded Michael Chekhov, Chekhov's nephew, to join her in forming an acting school and company, the Dartington Hall Players in England, they brought the troupe to the United States, where she performed in Shakespeare. Then she continued on Broadway as Olivia in ''Twelfth Night,'' Emily Dickinson in ''Eastward in Eden'' and Lady Macduff in ''Macbeth,'' with Michael Redgrave.         In 1948 she succeeded Wendy Hiller as Catherine Sloper in the Broadway production of ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of Henry James's ''Washington Square'' in which she played opposite Peter Cookson. After the run, she and Mr. Cookson married. It was a second marriage for both.         In 1950 Ms. Straight played the governess in ''The Innocents,'' an adaptation of James's ''Turn of the Screw'' produced by Mr. Cookson. In his Times review, Mr. Atkinson said that Ms. Straight acted ''with force, sensitivity and old-fashioned charm, in a style that Henry James would have been compelled to applaud.''         She continued to act on and off Broadway, playing opposite Richard Kiley in Robert Ardrey's ''Sing Me No Lullabies'' and opposite Van Heflin in the Broadway version of Rod Serling's television play ''Patterns.'' She also had the title role in Racine's ''Phèdre.''         In 1967 she was in ''Everything in the Garden,'' Edward Albee's adaptation of a play by Giles Cooper. In 1973 she played Mrs. Alving in a Roundabout Theater production of Ibsen's ''Ghosts'' and in 1979 was Gertrude to William Hurt's Hamlet at the Circle Repertory Company.         Among her many television appearances, she was Goneril to Orson Welles's King Lear in an abbreviated version of the play on ''Omnibus,'' and Rose Kennedy in ''Robert Kennedy and His Times.'' In 1986 she was in Mr. Lumet's film ''Power'' and in 1991 played Goldie Hawn's mother in ''Deceived.''         Throughout her life, Ms. Straight was also a producer and teacher. As a founder of Theater Incorporated, she was instrumental in bringing the Old Vic, with Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson, to the United States. In 1981 she helped revive Michael Chekhov's School of Theater in New York.         Ms. Straight's husband died in 1990. She is survived by her sons, Gary Cookson, an actor in New York, and Tony Cookson, a writer and director in Santa Monica, Calif.; two stepchildren, Peter Cookson Jr. of Irvington, N.Y., and Jane Coopland of Hawaii; a brother, Michael Straight of Chicago, a former deputy chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         Despite her patrician background, Ms. Straight always regarded herself as a working actress. ''I may have been born in society,'' she once said, ''but I was never part of anything but theater.''       
         Graziella Sciutti, an Italian soprano and opera director whose purity of sound and deft characterizations won her admiration in Mozart, Puccini and Verdi roles, died on Monday in Geneva. She was 73 and lived in Geneva and London.         The cause of death was cancer, according to The Associated Press.         Ms. Sciutti was born in Turin on April 17, 1927, and studied at the Santa Cecilia Conservatory in Rome. During her student years she was a soloist in a performance of Bach's ''St. Matthew Passion,'' conducted by Herbert von Karajan. She made her formal debut as Lucy in Gian-Carlo Menotti's ''Telephone'' at Aix-en-Provence in 1951, and she remained an important presence at the festival for many years. Among the roles she sang there were three of the Mozart roles that quickly became signature pieces for her, Susanna in ''Nozze di Figaro,'' Despina in ''Così Fan Tutte'' and Zerlina in ''Don Giovanni.''         She also created the title role of Henri Sauguet's ''Caprices de Marianne'' at Aix-en-Provence in 1954, the same year she made her Glyndebourne debut as Rosina in Rossini's ''Barbiere di Siviglia.'' She sang Carolina in Cimarosa's ''Matrimonio Segreto'' in the inaugural performances of the Piccola Scala, in Milan, where she went on to sing a broad repertory that included roles in Piccini's ''Buona Figliuola,'' Donizetti's ''Don Pasquale,'' Rossini's ''Comte Ory'' and Paisiello's ''Nina Pazza per Amore.''         Ms. Sciutti made her Covent Garden debut in 1956, and her American debut, at the San Francisco Opera, in 1961. She was also a member of the Vienna State Opera roster for several years, where her most successful roles were in the Mozart operas and as Nanetta in a Luchino Visconti production of Verdi's ''Falstaff.'' And she sang at the Salzburg Festival for nearly 20 years.         In 1977 Ms. Sciutti sang in and directed a production of Poulenc's ''Voix Humaine'' at Glyndebourne, preparing her way to give up the stage and become a director. She staged productions of ''Le Nozze di Figaro'' and Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore'' at the Canadian Opera, and in 1983 she made her New York directing debut with a highly praised staging of Puccini's ''Bohème'' at the Juilliard School. In 1984 she revised Colin Graham's production of ''Così Fan Tutte'' at the Metropolitan Opera. Her 1995 staging of ''La Bohème'' at the New York City Opera won an Emmy Award after it was broadcast as part of the ''Live From Lincoln Center'' series in 1997.         Ms. Sciutti taught at the Royal College of Music in London and gave master classes at the Lyric Center of Chicago, at the Juilliard School and as part of the Merola Opera Program at the San Francisco Opera.         She is survived by a daughter, Susanna.       
         Nyree Dawn Porter, who entranced millions of television viewers around the world when she starred as the beautiful Irene, trapped in a loveless marriage in the BBC adaptation of John Galsworthy's ''Forsyte Saga'' in the late 1960's, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 61.         Her agent said she died unexpectedly but gave no further details.         Produced by Donald Wilson to coincide with the centenary of Galsworthy's birth, the 26-part ''Forsyte Saga,'' which recounted the lives and loves of an upper-middle-class merchant family in London from 1879 to 1926, was first broadcast in 1967 and went on to attract more than 100 million viewers in 26 countries. It was shown in the United States on public television starting in 1969.         For Ms. Porter, whose performance won her an award from the Society of Film and Television Arts as best actress and designation by Queen Elizabeth II in 1970 as an officer of the Order of the British Empire, ''The Forsyte Saga'' proved to be a mixed blessing.         She said that afterward, BBC regarded her as ''our Irene'' and turned aside her agent's efforts to have her cast in other major roles. And her private life was shadowed  by her success and her travels as an actress. Her husband, Bryon O'Leary, an actor who had been a childhood friend and was often thrust aside by ''Forsyte'' fans eager to meet Irene, died in 1970 of an overdose of whiskey and barbiturates.         In 1976 Ms. Porter married another actor, Robin Halstead. Before they divorced in 1987, they had a daughter, Tayla, who survives her.         After ''Forsyte,'' Ms. Porter said, ''I waited for the movie offers to pour in, but they just didn't.''         Nevertheless, she remained busy. She starred in several British television series and continued to act on the stage and in films. In 1998 she played the ballerina Margot Fonteyn in the film ''Hilary and Jackie.''         Ms. Porter was born in New Zealand on Jan. 22, 1940. She was given a Maori name, Ngaire, meaning little heart-shaped flower, but for clarity she changed it to Nyree, its phonetic pronunciation. She left New Zealand for England in 1958.         In a few more years, her work in ''The Forsyte Saga'' would win her one critic's designation as ''the first romantic sex symbol of the telly age.''       
         Rita Hunter, the British soprano famed especially for her performances as Brünnhilde and Norma, died last Sunday in Sydney, Australia. She was 67.         Possessed of an immense voice, forthright and ringing, Ms. Hunter in her prime, which coincided roughly with the 1970's, seemed ready to take over from Birgit Nilsson as the world's leading Wagnerian soprano. In 1975, when the two singers appeared together at the Metropolitan Opera in ''Die Walküre,'' Ms. Hunter as Brünnhilde and Ms. Nilsson switching from that role to Sieglinde, it was as if the bequeathing -- or the challenge -- were being staged.         But the process stalled. When Ms. Hunter began to have difficulty controlling her voice, her gifts of native ability and robust good sense were insufficient.         Rita Nellie Hunter was born on Aug. 15, 1933, in Wallasey, England, where her father was a boilermaker. She had singing lessons with Olive Lloyd and Harry Burgon, and appeared in ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' when she was 14. She also studied with Edwin Francis in Liverpool.         In 1954 she joined the chorus of the Sadler's Wells Opera, in London, and continued her training with Edward Renton. Three years later she joined the Carl Rosa Opera and married a colleague, the baritone John Darnley-Thomas. She found herself back in London when the Carl Rosa and Sadler's Wells companies merged in 1959, but before resuming her career, she won a scholarship that allowed her to study for six months with the great soprano Eva Turner.         After that she went to her husband's teacher, Redvers Llewellyn, and began to get important roles at Sadler's Wells, including Senta in ''The Flying Dutchman'' in 1964, her first Wagner. In 1968 she had a baby, but was soon preparing for the English National Opera's ''Ring,'' under the conductor Reginald Goodall.         That ''Ring,'' which began with ''Die Walküre'' in 1970 and was completed in 1973, was a triumph, thanks partly to Ms. Hunter's boldly sung and magnificent Brünnhilde. She went on to sing -- apart from her Met Brünnhilde in the spring of 1975 -- the title role in ''Norma'' in San Francisco in October that year and at the Met immediately after. Her other roles included Abigaille in ''Nabucco'' (New Orleans, 1978), Turandot (Welsh National Opera, 1979) and Leonora in ''Il Trovatore'' (Welsh National Opera, 1980). She also repeated her Brünnhilde in the Seattle ''Ring'' of 1980.         She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1980.         In 1981 she signed a three-year contract with the Australian Opera, and sang Brünnhilde, Isolde, Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni,'' Aida, the ''Trovatore'' Leonora, Norma, and Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana.'' She elected to remain in Australia, and, though she did rather little stage work after 1985, was much in demand for concerts and recitals in Australia, Britain and the United States. Her autobiography, ''Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie,'' came out in 1986.         Her husband died in 1994. She is survived by her daughter, Mairwyn.       
         Judith Moses, a television news producer and teacher who also worked to expose the abuses confronted by journalists working on dangerous assignments abroad, died at home in Manhattan on Saturday. She was 61 and lived in Manhattan and Kent, Conn.         The cause was liver cancer, her husband, Harry Moses, said.         Mrs. Moses was on the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a human rights organization in Manhattan that focuses on the rights of reporters overseas. She produced public affairs documentaries and news programs for numerous networks and film companies over a 25-year career in journalism.         Her most recent work included the U.S. News & World Report/Freedom Forum series ''World@Large,'' which is broadcast on WNET, Channel 13, in New York.         Mrs. Moses, a Fulbright scholar, was an adjunct professor of journalism at the New York University Graduate School of Journalism last year and had taught in 13 African countries since 1991 as part of the United States Information Agency's Visiting Scholars Program, her husband said. She also trained human rights monitors in recording violations on videotape.         Since 1989, Mrs. Moses had been a principal in the Mosaic Group, a media company she founded with her husband in 1985. A PBS series that she produced with the Children's Express News Magazine won Peabody and Emmy Awards. From 1979 to 1989, she was an investigative producer for ''20/20,'' the ABC News magazine.         Mrs. Moses was born in Charleston, W.Va., and graduated from Smith College in 1962. After studying on a Fulbright scholarship in Germany, she worked as a translator, then began her career in news as an associate producer at ABC News, her husband said.         In addition to her husband, a producer for ''60 Minutes II,'' she is survived by their daughter, Anne Moses, and a granddaughter, both of San Francisco.       
         Adele Dellenbaugh Hofmann, a pediatrician who helped tailor medical science to the needs of teenagers, died on Friday at a hospital in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 74 and lived in nearby Laguna Beach.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         A practitioner of pediatrics for nearly 50 years, Dr. Hofmann was a leader in a movement to redefine how health professionals treated minors. She blended her knowledge of endocrinology, pediatrics, psychology and general medicine to shape  adolescent care into a pediatric specialty.         Dr. Hofmann was a founder of the Society for Adolescent Medicine, based in Blue Springs, Mo. and served as its president in 1976-77. The next year she founded the Section on Adolescent Health as a unit within the American Academy of Pediatrics; the section now gives an award in her name.         Dr. Hofmann contended that the passage to adulthood and emancipation meant difficult years for both child and parent.         ''What we're talking about is a decade,'' she once said, ''an age of human growth and development that has tremendously unique things happening emotionally and biologically.''         Over the years she published many articles on the legal rights of minors, teenage behavior and sexuality, and youths with special risks. Dr. Hofmann and Dr. Donald Graydanus wrote the authoritative textbook ''Adolescent Medicine.'' First published in 1986, it won an award from the American College of Internal Medicine the year after and went into its third edition in 1997 at McGraw Hill, where it remains in print.         She also wrote ''The Hospitalized Adolescent'' (1976), which received an American Nurses Association award, and ''Consent and Confidentiality in Child and Adolescent Care'' (1984).         Adele Dellenbaugh was born in Boston, a granddaughter of Frederick Samuel Dellenbaugh, an artist, writer and explorer. She graduated from Smith College in 1948 and from the University of Rochester Medical School in 1952.         She trained at Babies Hospital of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and was a National Foundation Fellow in Endocrinology at Presbyterian Hospital. She directed pediatric and adolescent programs at New York University, Bellevue Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital and Beth Israel Hospital in New York. After moving to California, she was affiliated with the Children's Hospital of Orange County and the University of California at Irvine.         Dr. Hofmann's marriage to Dr. Frederick G. Hofmann ended in divorce. He died in 1992. She is survived by a daughter, Annie Gardiner of Oakland, Calif., and a son, Peter, of Middletown, Conn.       
         Yvonne Dionne, a member of the first recorded set of quintuplets to survive more than a few days, died on Saturday morning in a Montreal hospital. She was 67.         She died of cancer, said Carlo Tarini, a family spokesman.         When they were born in 1934 to an already large, poor farm family in Callander, in Ontario, Yvonne, Emilie, Marie, Cecile and Annette together weighed 13 and a half pounds on an old potato scale.         They developed from a single egg before the days of fertility treatments, and became instantly famous, seemingly a cheery miracle in the midst of the Great Depression.         But, isolated from playmates and their own parents, they did not share that cheer. Quintland, the residence-cum-sideshow where paying visitors could view them three times a day through one-way glass, outstripped Niagara Falls as a Canadian tourist attraction.         The Canadian ''Little Women'' brought an estimated $500 million to Ontario over the nearly 20 years they lived there.         They met the Queen of England, christened warships and graced the cover of Life magazine, but when Yvonne first left home at 19, Mr. Tarini recalled her saying, she could not tell the difference between a nickel and a dime.         ''Multiple births should not be confused with entertainment, nor should they be an opportunity to sell products,'' she and her two surviving quintuplets wrote in an open letter to the parents of the McCaughey septuplets that was published in Time magazine in 1997. ''Our lives have been ruined by the exploitation we suffered.''         The first inkling of their profit potential came shortly after their birth when their father, Oliva, signed a contract to display them at the Chicago World's Fair. Public outrage ensued, and the government took the ''quints'' from their parents' care. At Quintland, the doctor who delivered them, Allan Dafoe, became their primary caretaker.         But that did not protect them from becoming a sideshow. The Dionne sisters appeared in advertisements for everything from Puretest Cod Liver Oil to Lysol and Palmolive. Because the rights to their image had been sold, they said later, their parents were not allowed to photograph them and visits from Oliva and their mother, Elzier, were discouraged.         Meanwhile, Dr. Dafoe became one of the world's most celebrated doctors, writing newspaper columns on the quints' daily schedule and even about the pebbles in Callander, which were said to enhance fertility. In 1936 the quints appeared in their first of several movies, ''The Country Doctor,'' based on the life of Dr. Dafoe.         Even their exploitation, seemingly, was exploited, in books like ''The Dionne Legend: Quintuplets in Captivity.'' In 1965, the sisters published their own plaintive memoirs: ''We Were Five: the Dionne Quintuplets' Story.'' In 1998, they sued the government for the separation from their parents and won $4 million.         After a custody battle, their father regained custody of them from the state when they were nearly 10 years old. But in a second book, ''Family Secrets: the Dionne Quintuplets' Autobiography,'' published in 1994, the three surviving quintuplets said that he had sexually abused them, an accusation that their other siblings denied.         The sisters, raised Roman Catholic, were in and out of convents, both as students and initiates. At 20, Emilie died of suffocation during an epileptic seizure.         At 21, the remaining sisters each got $250,000 from a trust fund of their childhood earnings, and shortly afterward they took a determined stab at normalcy, moving into an apartment in Montreal and thus beginning a long estrangement from their parents.         Three of the sisters eventually married and had children, later divorcing. Marie, who had been hospitalized for nervous depression and had placed her two daughters in foster care, died in 1970 of a blood clot. Yvonne is survived by Annette and Cecile Dionne and five of eight other siblings.         Yvonne Dionne, considered the most artistic of the sisters, made several attempts to join a convent before settling in St. Bruno in the home of her sister, Annette. She became a librarian and lobbied the government on behalf of the Duplessis Orphans, children, many of whom were born out of wedlock, who were placed in psychiatric wards in the 1950's, Mr. Tarini said.         She also traveled to Europe and India.         Cecile Dionne once called Yvonne ''the most reserved and perhaps the most individual of us.''       
         Imogene Coca, the saucer-eyed, rubber-faced comedian who teamed with Sid Caesar on NBC's ''Your Show of Shows'' and kept America's Saturday night television audiences in stitches for five years in the early 1950's, died yesterday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 92.         Her leer was superb, her wink epochal. Her eyebrow could rise to moronic bewilderment or descend to gold digger torch time. Her chin could jut out with the indignation of a dowager caught cheating at canasta or vanish into the pathos of an abandoned woman. And the wide, silent mouth could curl into almost anything: outrage, boredom, smugness, sweet innocence, and on and on.         To millions, that face -- elfin, mischievous, wistful -- was the funniest thing on television in television's golden age. With Mr. Caesar, who was the top star and got most of the punch lines, Ms. Coca spoofed movies, society matrons, marital bliss and everyday life with extraordinary pantomimes, with a chanteuse voice that seemed always on the edge of a screech, with toe dances that laid waste to Debussy's ''Afternoon of a Faun.''         A child of vaudeville performers who lived out of a trunk and put her on the stage as an 11-year-old song-and-dance girl, Ms. Coca drifted from nightclubs in the 1920's to variety shows and Broadway revues in the 1930's. She was often out of work until her television career began, and then it was rags to riches: $10,000 a week, a $1 million contract.         From 1949, when they began tickling television audiences in the ''Admiral Broadway Revue,'' the forerunner of ''Your Show of Shows,'' to 1954, when they split up, Ms. Coca and Mr. Caesar were one of television's most hilarious and successful combinations, reaching peak audiences of more than 25 million people that swamped the competition.         ''Your Show of Shows'' did more than dominate the Saturday night viewing habits of the American household. The 90-minute show started the careers of some of the nation's most successful writers and performers and set comedic standards that gave rise to Carol Burnett, Gilda Radner, Lily Tomlin and others. For many viewers old enough to remember, the show still represents television comedy at its most inventive.         Sex, politics and religion were out of bounds for television comedy in that era. So ''Your Show of Shows,'' which also starred Carl Reiner and Howard Morris and at various times counted Mel Brooks, Neil Simon and Woody Allen among its writers, had to be fashioned out of the broader terrain of everyday life, which gave the comedy a timeless, classic quality.         Blending lunatic fantasy and more contortions than a fun house mirror, Ms. Coca caricatured the foibles of housewives, spinsters, opera singers, ballet dancers, pouting flappers and haughty socialites, while Mr. Caesar provided the stoicism of a luckless schlemazel and wacky foreign accents -- memorably, a fastidious Prussian with a ''geschmutzik'' monocle who dons a bemedaled tunic and braided military cap and barks orders at his aide-de-camp: ''Brushin' a Prussian!'' ''Perfuma-schpritzen!'' -- then marches off to his job as a doorman.         The sketches were never about very much, often just an idea: a wife trying to hide the fact that she has just smashed up her husband's car, a roof leaking on an elegant dinner party, a catered boardroom lunch that lurches into chaos over who gets the chopped liver as a slavering chairman lusts after a pickle wagged by his vice chairman.         In one pantomime, Ms. Coca, Mr. Caesar, Mr. Reiner and Mr. Morris were life-size mechanical figures on a Bavarian town clock, trotting out to strike the hours -- hammer on anvil, a splash of water from a dipper, a wheezing bellows -- until the thing goes madly, progressively to pieces, leaving all the quaint lederhosen figures drenched, battered and sprung.         In another, Ms. Coca was a wife posing for her amateur photographer husband, who could not quite satisfy himself about her face. Poking here, pushing there, he kept rearranging her features, which froze where he put them. Finally, he got it right: her left eye shut in a grotesque wink, the right following him around the room like a searchlight. The husband-and-wife routines -- dubbed ''The Hickenloopers'' -- became a staple of marital rapture and catastrophe.         In ''The Sewing Machine Girl,'' a sendup of sweatshops, Ms. Coca, with Mr. Reiner as a badgering, leering boss, worked faster and faster, drooping lower and lower, until at last she gave up, did a whirling dervish dance of consumption, collapsed in death throes and, sprouting wings, flew up to heaven on wires.         In ''From Here to Obscurity,'' a parody of Fred Zinnemann's film ''From Here to Eternity,'' Ms. Coca played the hard, innocent bar girl and Mr. Caesar her boxing-bugler soldier, tragic lovers in Hawaii on the eve of war. At last, they are alone together on a beach, in swimsuits under the moonlight. You can hear the romantic music, the waves rolling in.         ''I love you,'' she says passionately.         They start to embrace.         And water -- about a bucketful -- splashes in their faces.         ''I love you,'' he says gamely.         Dripping, bedraggled, shivering, she can hardly keep a straight face as another bucketful hits them.         ''There's one thing I have to ask,'' he says.         ''Yes?''         ''Did you bring a towel?''         Ms. Coca's musical satire came from a well-trained but not powerful voice. She could turn a Wagner aria into a nightmare of brow-knitted concentration, quavering glissandos and narrow escapes from tonal disaster -- just the reverse of a young singer approaching a difficult passage, the mezzo-soprano Risë Stevens once said. ''You're always deathly afraid the young singer will never make the last note,'' she said. ''With Imogene, you're always afraid she will.''         Her dance spoofs were also a result of years of training, and were far more subtle than most audiences realized, extracting humor not by stumbling around but by finely exaggerated professional movements. In ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' she traipsed off in amorous pursuit of a prancing satyr, eventually making her capture by pouring salt from a shaker over his little goat tail.         But it was Ms. Coca's flexible face and her talents as a pantomime that delighted most audiences. ''Imogene can look so abandoned that you wonder if she ever had anybody to abandon her in the first place,'' a friend said. And Max Liebman, who produced and directed ''Your Show of Shows'' for NBC, said, ''The great thing about Imogene is that one nostril never knows what the other is doing.''         At the height of her success, Ms. Coca, who won an Emmy as the best actress of 1951, was making $10,000 a week. After ''Your Show of Shows'' ended in 1954, NBC gave Ms. Coca her own half-hour show and a 10-year, $1 million contract. She was paid half that sum in the first year, but her show faltered and she gave up the balance of the contract.         Ms. Coca subsequently appeared in nightclubs, Broadway plays, films and many television specials. In 1958, she and Mr. Caesar were reunited for an ABC program that ran 18 weeks. And in 1967, ''The Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, Howard Morris Special'' won an Emmy Award for the year's best variety show. But, critics said, the old Caesar-Coca magic was not quite there.         From 1950 to 1954, they had made 160 editions of ''Your Show of Shows.'' Those were the years before videotape, when television was live and programs -- classics or not -- vanished into the ether. But Mr. Liebman, the producer, kept ''Your Show of Shows'' on kinescopes, 16-millimeter films.         Last year, like a long-delayed punch line, the staff of the City Center in Manhattan found 47 dusty boxes of long-lost scripts and other memorabilia (but no kinescopes) from ''Your Show of Shows,'' the ''Admiral Broadway Revue'' and other pioneering television productions. They had been stashed away in a closet in an office suite where Mr. Caesar, Ms. Coca and their writers created shows, and had apparently lain undisturbed for nearly 40 years.         In 1973, Mr. Liebman and Mr. Caesar created and released ''Ten From 'Your Show of Shows,' '' a selection of some of the best skits in a 35-millimeter enlargement that went into the nation's movie houses and was enthusiastically received by critics and audiences. Videotapes have since made ''Ten From 'Your Show of Shows' '' widely available to a new generation of fans.         Among its offerings, ''At the Movies'': A poor sap (Mr. Caesar) goes into a theater to relax. He chews 10 sticks of gum while eating handfuls of popcorn. A woman (Ms. Coca) comes in and sits next to him. She begins to squirm and fidget with her skirt. Soon, they are both squirming and fidgeting.         Her jealous boyfriend (Mr. Reiner) enters and accuses them of meeting secretly. The lovers quarrel. The sap moves over one seat, trying to stay out of it. To defy her boyfriend, she moves over and kisses him. (''I'll kiss the fathead if I want!'') Enraged boyfriend attacks unresisting sap. Finally, the lovers make up and depart, arm in arm, leaving the bystander mauled and in tatters.         In 1963, Ms. Coca starred with Jack Lemmon in the film ''Under the Yum Yum Tree'' and in a television comedy called ''Grindl,'' about the adventures of a maid. She later appeared in nightclubs and regional playhouses and in 1979 was in a Broadway revival of ''On the Twentieth Century.''         Imogene Coca was born in Philadelphia on Nov. 18, 1908, the daughter of José Fernandez de Coca, a violinist and vaudeville band leader, and Sadie Brady Coca, a dancer who also performed in a magician's act.         When the Cocas were not on the road, home was a tumultuous Philadelphia household where singers, dancers, actors, gag men and acrobats kept life in a constant swirl. An only child, Imogene spent her early years in the theaters where her parents worked. At the age of 5, she began piano lessons; at 6, singing lessons, and at 7 dancing lessons.         She went to school in Atlantic City for several years, but by the age of 11 was performing in vaudeville. At 13, she was singing in a slinky black dress at the Dixie in Manayunk, Pa., and at 15 was performing in Jimmy Durante's Silver Slipper Club in New York. She made her Broadway debut at 17 in the chorus line of ''When You Smile'' in 1925.         For years, she bounced from show to show, when employed at all. Finally she got a lucky break. Shivering in a chilly theater while rehearsing for Leonard Sillman's ''New Faces of 1934,'' Ms. Coca, a lesser light to Henry Fonda and other young stars, wrapped herself in someone's huge coat and began clowning around: a fan dance with flapping ends. Mr. Sillman saw it and put it in the show. The show flopped, but critics hailed Ms. Coca as a rising comedian.         In another flop, ''Fools Rush In,'' she met Robert Burton, an actor. They were married the day after the play closed in 1935. Mr. Burton, who became a record company executive, died in 1955. In 1960, Ms. Coca married King Donovan, an actor she had met on a summer theater tour. They often performed together in plays and variety shows. Mr. Donovan died in 1987.         Ms. Coca had no survivors.         A small woman -- 5 feet 3 and 100 pounds -- Ms. Coca was shy offstage, a gentle, unassuming, sensitive person, friends said.         Someone who worked with her remembered that once in the chaos of a rehearsal for ''Your Show of Shows'' on a night when the cast was tired and nerves were frayed, when lines were lost and nobody believed it would all come together for the cameras at 9, Ms. Coca suddenly twisted her face into an appalling moue.         The tension dissolved in an uproar of laughter.         ''She had the wonderful faculty of understanding,'' the friend said.         Correction:  June 7, 2001, Thursday  An obituary of the comedian Imogene Coca on Sunday referred incorrectly to a Broadway production of ''On the 20th Century'' in which she appeared. It was the original one, which opened in 1978, not a 1979 revival.       
         Louise Sulzberger, who was active in New York City social service work for many years and was a member of the New York State Commission on Aging and the community planning board for the Upper East Side, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 103.         Mrs. Sulzberger was the wife of David Hays Sulzberger, a stockbroker who was the brother of Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times from 1935 to 1961. Her father was Hugo Blumenthal, a banker and philanthropist who was president of the Mount Sinai School of Nursing for many years.         Louise Mayer Blumenthal, who was born in New York and educated at Miss Jacobi's, a private school, founded and directed the Yorkville Neighborhood Club, a recreation center for older people. She served as a nurse's aide at Roosevelt Hospital during World Wars I and II. She was named to Community Board No. 8 by former Mayor Edward I. Koch.         An avid golfer, Mrs. Sulzberger was women's champion of the Century Country Club in Purchase, N.Y., in 1929, 1933 and 1939, and won several Westchester County championships and New York State senior tournaments.         David Hays Sulzberger died in 1962. Mrs. Sulzberger is survived by two daughters, Jean Sulzberger and Ann S. Sand, both of New York City, and by 7 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Ellen S. Straus, died in 1995.

         Eudora Welty, whose evocative short stories, notable for their imagery, sharp dialogue and fierce wit, made her a revered figure in contemporary American letters, died yesterday at a hospital near her home in Jackson, Miss. She was 92.         She was plagued by health problems and had been confined for some time to her home, where she had lived since high school and where she wrote most of her stories, novels, essays, memoirs and book reviews.         As a short-story master, Miss Welty is often mentioned by critics in the same breath as Chekhov, but she was  dismissed early in her career as a regionalist and did not earn widespread critical respect until she was no longer young. When recognition came, she accepted it with the ease, modesty and grace that had become her hallmarks.         She was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her novel ''The Optimist's Daughter.'' She also received the National Book Critics Circle Award, the American Book Award, several O. Henry Awards and the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. She was inducted into the French Legion of Honor and received the Medal of Freedom in 1980, presented, she said happily, by ''one of my great Southern heroes, President Jimmy Carter.''         Late in 1998 Miss Welty said she was ''excited and delighted'' to learn that she had become the first living writer to be included in the prestigious Library of America series of collected works by United States literary giants. The library's break with its long tradition of choosing only dead authors for its series of definitive collections ushered Miss Welty into a pantheon that includes Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Edgar Allan Poe and William Faulkner.         For decades she was pigeonholed by critics who placed her with Faulkner, Katherine Anne Porter, Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers as a writer of the so-called Southern School. Her reputation as a regional and apolitical writer was often cited as a reason for her failure to win a Nobel Prize. But her work, like that of those other Southern writers, transcended region and possessed a universal relevance and appeal.         ''It is not the South we find in her stories, it is Eudora Welty's South, a region that feeds her imagination and a place we come to trust,'' Maureen Howard said when she reviewed Miss Welty's ''Collected Stories'' in 1980. ''She is a Southerner as Chekhov was a Russian, because place provides them with a reality -- a reality as difficult, mysterious and impermanent as life.''         A Clan of Readers         Eudora Welty was born on April 13, 1909, in Jackson, the daughter of Christian Webb Welty, an Ohio native, and the former Chestina Andrews, who had been a West Virginia schoolteacher. The Weltys settled in Jackson shortly after their marriage, and Mr. Welty became an executive of the Lamar Life Insurance company. They also had two sons younger than Miss Welty.         The Weltys were devoted to books and learning. In ''One Writer's Beginnings,'' Miss Welty's 1984 memoir based on a series of lectures she gave at Harvard, she recalled the exhilaration she felt when she fell under the spell of books.         ''It had been startling and disappointing to me to find out that storybooks had been written by people, that books were not natural wonders, coming up of themselves like grass,'' she wrote. ''Yet regardless of where they came from, I cannot remember a time when I was not in love with them -- with the books themselves, cover and binding and the paper they were printed on, with their smell and their weight and with their possession in my arms, captured and carried off to myself. Still illiterate, I was ready for them, committed to all the reading I could give them.''         Miss Welty was a daily visitor to the local Andrew Carnegie Library, where she was allowed what she later called ''a sweet devouring'' -- a ration of two books a day by the stern-faced librarian. Several decades later, in 1986, the building was replaced; the new one was named the Eudora Welty Library.         Miss Welty learned to read before starting public school and began turning out stories as a child.         ''It took Latin to thrust me into a bona fide alliance with words in their true meaning,'' she wrote. ''Learning Latin (once I was free of Caesar) fed my love for words upon words, words in continuation and modification, and the beautiful, sober accretion of a sentence. I could see the achieved sentence finally standing there, as real, intact and built to stay as the Mississippi State Capitol at the top of my street, where I could walk through it on my way to school and hear underfoot the echo of its marble floor and over me the bell of its rotunda.''         'Listening for Stories'         Miss Welty said she discovered stories in daily life. ''Long before I wrote stories, I listened for stories,'' she wrote in 1984. ''Listening for them is something more acute than listening to them. I suppose it's an early form of participation in what goes on. Listening children know stories are there. When their elders sit and begin, children are just waiting and hoping for one to come out, like a mouse from its hole.''         Miss Welty attended the Mississippi State College for Women, where she helped to start a literary magazine, and then the University of Wisconsin, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1929. After college Miss Welty told her parents that she wanted to be a writer, but she said that her father insisted that she ''learn something to fall back on'' to support herself, so she took advertising courses at the Columbia University School of Business.         Back in Jackson in the early 1930's, Miss Welty wrote for a radio station and contributed society items to The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. During the Depression she got a publicity job at the Works Progress Administration, which enabled her to travel throughout Mississippi. She was troubled and fascinated by the people she saw and took hundreds of snapshots with a cheap camera, developing her prints in her kitchen at night. In 1971 Random House published a collection of these pictures, ''One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression.'' The book's stark, often grim black-and-white photographs revealed that Miss Welty's long-admired sense of observation was not limited to the ear.         ''I learned quickly enough when to click the shutter,'' she said later, ''but what I was becoming aware of more slowly was a story-writer's truth. The thing to wait on, to reach there in time for, is the moment when you see it. In my own case, a fuller awareness of what I needed to find out about people and their lives had to be sought for through another way, through writing stories. I knew this, anyway: that my wish, indeed my continuing passion, would be not to point the finger in judgment but to part a curtain, that invisible shadow that falls between people, the veil of indifference to each other's presence, each other's wonder, each other's human plight.''         The Depression pictures were exhibited in New York in 1936, the same year that Miss Welty, who had sent dozens of unsolicited stories to magazines, finally made her first sale. A small literary magazine called Manuscript accepted ''Death of a Traveling Salesman,'' the often anthologized recounting of the last day in the life of a lonely, ill and frightened shoe salesman who loses his way in rural Mississippi. Before he dies of a heart attack, he realizes fleetingly how little he has understood about himself and others.         It was the first of several stories published in small magazines. ''None of these publications paid, not really,'' Miss Welty recalled years later. ''Oh, I think The Southern Review was giving $25 a story, but it took two years before an agent could place one of my stories in a national magazine.''         Life at the P.O.         Miss Welty began to attract attention after The Atlantic Monthly published two of her stories destined to become classics: ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' and ''A Worn Path.'' The first, one of the most popular of the dozens that were to be printed in the years to come, is a first-person explanation by a small-town postmistress of why she is moving out of her eccentric family's home to live at the post office. The second won Miss Welty her first of six O. Henry Awards.         Early admirers of her short stories pressed Miss Welty to try her hand at a novel, but she resisted for several years. Her first hardcover book was a 1941 short-story collection, ''A Curtain of Green,'' with an introduction by Katherine Anne Porter, who had encouraged her early on. ''A Curtain of Green '' sold only 7,000 copies in 30 years, but the 17 stories in the collection became widely known and valued through their inclusion in many anthologies and college textbooks.         The editor and critic James Olney said of ''A Curtain of Green'': ''The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber 'Death of a Traveling Salesman' to the hallucinatory 'Flowers for Marjorie,' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces of 'Clytie' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece, from the jazzy 'Powerhouse' to the satiric 'Petrified Man,' from the wildly comic 'Why I Live at the P.O.' to the dignified 'A Worn Path' (the 'grave, persistent, meditative' sound of old Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the tone at the outset).''         ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' combined Miss Welty's antic sense of humor with her pleasure in language. As the narrator prepares to leave her family's home, she says: ''So I hope to tell you I marched in and got the radio. And they could of all bit a nail in two, especially Stella-Rondo, that it used to belong to, and she well knew she couldn't get it back, I'd sue for it like a shot . . . The thermometer and the Hawaiian ukulele were certainly mine, and I stood on the stepladder and got all my watermelon-rind preserves and every fruit and vegetable I put up, every jar.''         An Internet Legacy         Many years later Eudora, the widely used e-mail program, was named after Miss Welty because its designer, Steven Dorner, said he had been processing so much e-mail that he felt like the Welty character who lived at the post office.         In 1941 Miss Welty followed ''A Curtain of Green'' with ''The Wide Net and Other Stories,'' and in 1942 she published ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' a novella that later became a successful musical in an adaptation by Alfred Uhry and Robert Waldman. Her first full-length novel, ''Delta Wedding,'' appeared in 1946.         Three years later, a group of stories set in Morgana, an imaginary small town on the Mississippi Delta, was published under the title ''The Golden Apples.'' All of Miss Welty's gifts for compression, metaphorical language and poetic structure were on display. So was her genius for using the details of daily life to illuminate the mysteries of the heart. In the story ''The Whole World Knows,'' she charted a doomed meeting between a young couple who were estranged:         ''There in the flower beds walked the same robins. The sprinkler dripped now. Once again we went into the house by the back door. Our hands touched. We had stepped on Tellie's patch of mint. The yellow cat was waiting to go in with us, the door handle was as hot as the hand, and on the step, getting under the feet of two people who went in together, the Mason jars with the busy cuttings in water -- ''Watch out for Mama's!'' -- a thousand times we had gone in like that. As a thousand bees had droned and burrowed in the pears that lay on the ground.''         During World War II, Miss Welty was briefly on the staff of The New York Times Book Review and sometimes contributed reviews under the pseudonym Michael Ravenna. But she returned to Jackson during the 1950's, when her mother and brothers fell seriously ill. For almost 15 years, from the mid-50's to the late 60's, she published just a few short stories, some book reviews and a children's book, ''The Shoe Bird'' (1964). During this period she cared for her family and worked on two novels. Some writers speculated that she also suffered some spiritual ordeal or artistic crisis. After the deaths of her mother and brothers, she returned in the 70's with the novels ''Losing Battles'' and ''The Optimist's Daughter.''         Miss Welty's stories often reflected the fruits of her wide reading and special interests. ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' for example, incorporates elements of folklore, fairy tales, classical myths and legends of the Mississippi River and the Natchez Trace, the road of pioneer days that stretched from Natchez, Miss., to Nashville.         In ''Delta Wedding,'' Miss Welty concentrates on the frenzied activities of the extended Fairchild family in the week before the marriage of a daughter to the plantation's overseer, who is considered by several of the Fairchilds to be an intruder unworthy of admission into the family.         Fiction of Family Life         That book, as well as the short novel ''The Ponder Heart'' (1954) and her longest one, ''Losing Battles'' (1970), are examples of Miss Welty's preoccupation with family life. They focus on weddings, reunions and funerals, which all bring family members together to recall the past, criticize and lavish praise on one another and settle old scores.         Her novels and stories expose the foibles to which large clans are prone, their tendencies to resist change, squelch individuality and ostracize outsiders. Miss Welty often shifts points of view to accomplish this, but in ''The Ponder Heart,'' she  demonstrates her extraordinary ear for dialect and a sense of the ridiculous as she tells the entire story as a comic monologue by Edna Earle Ponder, a garrulous hotel manager. This novel was adapted for the stage by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov and became a hit when it opened on Broadway in 1956.         Commenting on many critics' observations that ''Losing Battles'' and her other works carried a strong sense of place, Miss Welty said: ''I think Southerners have such an intimate sense of place. We grew up in the fact that we live here with people about whom we know almost everything that can be known as a citizen of the same neighborhood or town. We learn significant things that way. We know what the place has made of these people, what they've made of the place through generations. We have a sense of continuity and that, I think, comes from place.''         And because she was in her particular place in the racially discordant 60's, she said, ''I was one of the writers who received dead-of-night telephone calls, when I was harangued by strangers saying, 'Why are you sitting down there writing your stories instead of out condemning your society?' ''         ''I didn't need their pointers to know that there was injustice among human beings or that there was trouble,'' she continued. ''I had been writing about that steadily right along, by letting my characters show this. I see as my privilege writing about human beings as human beings with all the things that make them up, including bigotry, misunderstanding, injustice and also love and affection and whatever else. Whatever else makes them up interests me.''         Miss Welty made one notable exception to her rule against direct crusading when Medgar Evers, the black civil rights leader, was shot to death by a sniper in Jackson in 1963.         ''I did write a story the night it happened,'' she said. ''I was so upset about this, and I thought: I live down here where this happened and I believe I must know what a person like that felt like -- the murderer. There had been so many stories about such a character in the stock manner, written by people who didn't know the South, so I wrote about the murderer intimately -- in the first person, which was a very daring thing for me to do.''         In the Mind of an Assassin         The story, ''Where Is the Voice Coming From?,'' was rushed into print in The New Yorker only days after Evers's killer was arrested. Taking up only two pages, it was a chilling journey into the mind of a bigoted psychopath. Hailed as a disturbingly effective examination of the roots of racial hatred, it has since been included in many anthologies.         Miss Welty never married. (Marriage, she said, ''never came up.'') She leaves no immediate survivors.         Although she was a shy person, she had many friends who were writers, among them Porter, Robert Penn Warren, Elizabeth Bowen, V. S. Pritchett, Cleanth Brooks, Shelby Foote, Walker Percy, Elizabeth Spencer, Ross MacDonald and Reynolds Price. She also had an enduring friendship with Diarmuid Russell, the agent who fiercely and devotedly represented her.         Her friends often spoke of her innate courtesy, which led her to seldom turn down requests for interviews. Those conversations usually took place at her home, and she often offered her interviewer bourbon and a home-cooked meal. She was warm and humorously self-deprecating.         One unlikely caller was Henry Miller. Miss Welty's mother, who had heard that Miller was a writer of obscene books, banned him from  their house. When Miss Welty did see him, she reported that he was ''the dullest man I ever saw in my life.''         ''He wasn't interested in anything outside himself,'' she said, ''that was the truth.''         In 1943, Faulkner wrote an unsolicited letter to Miss Welty after he had by chance read ''The Robber Bridegroom.''         ''You're doing all right,'' he said. That letter was hung near her wooden desk in an upstairs room in the Tudor-style house that her father built on Pinehurst Street in 1925, when she was 16.         ''The writing of a novel is taking life as it already exists,'' Miss Welty said. ''What distinguishes it above all from the raw material, and what distinguishes it from journalism, is that inherent is the possibility of a shared act of the imagination between its writer and its reader. There is absolutely everything in great fiction but a clear answer.''         Correction:  July 25, 2001, Wednesday  An obituary of the author Eudora Welty yesterday misstated the number of O. Henry Awards she received for short stories and misidentified the first of her stories to win one. The total was eight, not six. The first was for ''Petrified Man'' (1939); ''A Worn Path'' won in 1941.       
         Frances R. Horwich, the amiable educator who engaged millions of preschoolers as the host of the pioneering children's program ''Ding Dong School'' in the 1950's, died yesterday. She was 93.         Ringing an old-fashioned school bell to start the show, she would look into the camera, warmly wish a good morning and ask, ''How are you today?'' She paused so that toddlers at home, watching a somewhat matronly figure in swept-back hair and wearing a wool jacket, could answer. And they often did, thanks to her kindly, conversational style.         Then, ''Miss Frances'' would tell stories or demonstrate activities, like making pipe-cleaner figures or clay models. She used inexpensive, familiar toys and interspersed her presentation with unobtrusive lessons:         ''Ask your mother where to play with it,'' for a homemade musical instrument.         ''Be sure your sleeves are rolled up,'' for a messier project.         The half-hour show ended with a five-minute summation of the material.         ''Ding Dong School'' began on a Chicago station, WNBQ, in 1952. It was so popular that after six weeks, NBC picked up the program, and soon it was seen in at least 36 cities, with viewership reaching three million. The program was broadcast live at 10 a.m. on weekdays for four years, going to WNET in New York in 1959.         ''Ding Dong School,'' directed and produced by Reinald Werrenrath Jr., was one of a series of high-quality, innovative broadcasts by WNBQ that became its own of golden age of television, said Jeff Kisseloff, a television historian.         Unlike many of the children's show hosts of the period, Ms. Horwich ''actually taught kids things,'' Mr. Kisseloff said. And rather than the ''high-tech, dazzly stuff'' of today, ''it was her sitting in front of a piano or a drawing table,'' he said.         ''The intent was to educate the kids plainly and straightforwardly,'' he said. ''The fact was that it worked. You didn't need all the bells and whistles to keep kids watching.''         Its daily competitors at the time were ''Captain Kangaroo'' on CBS and ''Mickey Mouse Theater'' on ABC. A few years later, the successors to ''Ding Dong School'' appeared: ''Sesame Street'' and ''Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.''         In her era, a far simpler time when there was no Cartoon Network or hip, irony-tinged children's programs, Ms. Horwich won acclaim. She received a George Foster Peabody award in 1953.         ''She imbues in the youngsters a sense of friendliness, confidence and faith that is truly magical television,'' The New York Times television critic, Jack Gould, wrote that year. ''She is a teacher, yes, but she is also a very genuine friend of the tots who sit entranced before the receivers.''         When she began promoting the products of sponsors, however, Mr. Gould called the step ''heartbreaking.''         ''The program is too important in too many homes to be allowed to go astray through regrettable short-sightedness,'' he wrote.         In interviews, Ms. Horwich seemed better at saying what children's programming should not be.         ''I don't think a television program should make a child's life complicated,'' she said in a 1955 interview. ''It should not get him into trouble with his parents. Sometimes very innocently a television program teaches a child a trick that is not socially acceptable and, therefore, gets him into trouble. It is not socially acceptable to throw a pie at someone or to fill someone's hat with water,'' she added, perhaps a not-so-subtle jab at Bozo the Clown.         She also deplored the violence of Westerns and crime programs, though added that normal children could handle it.         What television should do is appeal to their interests, open ''new doors and windows'' of enlightenment and help children learn to be resourceful, Ms. Horwich said.         Frances Rappaport was born in Ottawa, Ohio, on July 16, 1908, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1929. She earned her doctorate in education from Northwestern University in 1942.         In 1931, she married Harvey L. Horwich, who was later a technical consultant to the United States Air Force. Mr. Horwich died in the early 1970's. The couple had no children.         For more than two decades before first ringing the ''Ding Dong'' bell, Ms. Horwich worked in education. She taught first grade, supervised nursery schools in Chicago, was a principal, and held professorships in education at the University of North Carolina and Roosevelt College in Chicago.         But her biggest class was filled with the millions of children in America's living rooms born just a few years after World War II.         ''Our little school gives them a sense of belonging,'' she said.       
         Elizabeth Yates, a writer whose books, many of them for children, were more than enough to fill a library shelf, died on Sunday at a hospice in Concord, N.H. A resident of Peterborough, N.H., she was 95.         Ms. Yates published her first book in 1938 and wrote more than 50 others into the mid-1990's. Many remain in print, including one that has taught young readers about black history in New England for half a century.         First published in 1950, ''Amos Fortune, Free Man'' traced the story of an adolescent African prince sold into slavery and brought to this country. Ms. Yates became aware of him when she happened upon his grave in a New Hampshire cemetery.         Intrigued by the inscription, she painstakingly researched his life and found how he, a complex man with a deep sense of honor, bought his freedom and built a home, a family and his own successful business as a skilled weaver and tanner. Like 25 other books by her, it was illustrated by her friend, the British artist Nora Unwin. It won the 1951 Newbery Medal and was translated into several foreign languages, as were some of her other books.         She also wrote an autobiographical trilogy and biographies of some strong-willed people. Among the latter was ''Prudence Crandall'' (Aladdin, 1955), about a teacher who defied Connecticut law in 1833 when she opened a private girls' school that accepted black and white pupils as equals.         Elizabeth Yates was born in Buffalo and went to school there and in Mamaroneck, N.Y. Living in Europe in the 1930's she started writing travel articles for American newspapers, including The Christian Science Monitor and The New York Times.         Back in this country she helped organize writers' conferences and lectured at Christian Writers and Editors Conferences in Green Lake, Wis.         She was active as an environmentalist. One of her books, ''The Road Through Sandwich Notch'' (Greene, 1972; reprinted 1984) helped to discourage development of that part of the White Mountains and to turn it into a national forest. She donated her Peterborough home, along with 45 acres of land, to the State of New Hampshire and the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests.         Her husband, William McGreal, died in 1963.       
         Kim Stanley, whose infrequent but luminous stage portraits brought her to the edge of greatness, but who ultimately shrank from the pressures of performance and stardom, died yesterday at a hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 76 and lived in Santa Fe.         She died after a prolonged illness, said her daughter Rachel Ryder Zahn.         In plays like William Inge's ''Picnic,'' Horton Foote's ''Traveling Lady'' and, especially, Inge's ''Bus Stop,'' Ms. Stanley captivated Broadway audiences and dazzled the critics in roles that ranged from a gauche young tomboy to a gallant abandoned wife to a well-traveled wisecracking nightclub singer.         She seemed able to take on almost any part and make it come convincingly alive. In the 1955 ''Bus Stop,'' she played Cherie, a worn-at-the-edges nightclub singer -- she calls herself a chanteuse -- who finds herself sitting out a snowstorm in a Kansas diner with her fellow bus passengers, one of whom is a swaggering cowboy. Their sparring not only won laughs, but also touched the heart.         Ms. Stanley, who later admitted to being tone deaf, even managed a deftly comic rendition of ''That Old Black Magic.'' Brooks Atkinson, in The New York Times, summed up her work as superb and called it a ''glowing performance that is full of amusing detail -- cheap, ignorant, bewildered, but also radiant with personality.''         Ms. Stanley had already won accolades two years earlier as the hoydenish teenager Millie Owens in ''Picnic.'' Then, cast as Georgette Thomas, a young mother whose husband has deserted her in Mr. Foote's 1954 drama ''The Traveling Lady,'' Ms. Stanley so dominated the stage that she was given star billing two days after the play's premiere.         There were more good reviews for her stage work in the years that followed. She appeared in ''A Clearing in the Woods,'' ''A Touch of the Poet,'' ''Cheri,'' ''A Far Country'' and ''The Three Sisters,'' among other plays, but nothing came close to her success in ''Bus Stop'' except her performance in the 1958 film ''The Goddess,'' one of her rare forays into Hollywood.         In that film Ms. Stanley won praise as a glamorous actress whose life is emotionally barren, managing to project glamour even though she was quick to concede she was no celluloid siren. She soon decided she did not much like acting for the cameras. The fragmented nature of movie making frustrated her. It was, she said, like ''shooting pool in the dark.''         Kim Stanley, whose original name was Patricia Reid, was born on Feb. 11, 1925, in Tularosa, N.M. Her parents were divorced when she was a young girl, and she and her three brothers were raised by her mother, an interior decorator who moved the family from New Mexico to Texas. Often lonely as a child, she wrote poetry and dreamed of becoming an artist or, at the very least, the local May Queen. She acted in school plays, attended the University of New Mexico and eventually graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Texas.         Her acting experiences in school had kindled a spark, she later said, but she was still thinking of pursuing a graduate degree and perhaps a career in medicine. Then she was approached by a director of the Pasadena Playhouse, who by chance had seen her perform in a college production and offered her a scholarship. She stayed at the California theater only a year, but it was enough to change the course of her life. The compass pointed toward Broadway.         After a season of walk-ons with a stock company in Louisville, Ky., where she'd gone at the urging of a friend who was working there, she boarded a Greyhound bus for New York. After a few fruitless months of making the rounds, talking to agents and trying to see producers, she turned to modeling dresses and then worked as a waitress at a hotel. She also went through a brief marriage to another aspiring actor, Bruce Hall.         The Off Broadway theater was in its infancy, but Ms. Stanley (she had taken her maternal grandmother's maiden name some years before) took an unpaid job with a Greenwich Village group called the Interplayers and lived off the money she had earned as a model. She met other promising newcomers, among them Gene Saks, Sidney Lumet and Michael V. Gazzo (later to write ''A Hatful of Rain'') and soon found herself in a new group called Off Broadway Inc.         She joined the Actors Studio, where she met and worked with the Studio's guru, Lee Strasberg, and later described him as the person ''who made it possible for the whole world to open up for me.'' Method acting, she said, was the key to becoming ''as free as possible.''         In 1949 she put her training to work at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, acting opposite Anthony Franciosa in Gertrude Stein's ''Yes Is for a Very Young Man,'' a production that drew good reviews and calls from theatrical agents. More good notices followed her next appearance, as St. Joan at the Equity Library Theater, and when the producer Kermit Bloomgarden called to invite her to replace Julie Harris in Lillian Hellman's ''Montserrat,'' she made the leap to Broadway.         Ms. Stanley married for the second time in 1949, to another actor, Curt Conway, with whom she had a son, Jamison, and a daughter, Lisa, and soon found herself torn between the conflicting demands of family and career. Performance pressures also began to take their toll, and even after her shining success in ''Bus Stop,'' stories began to circulate about her profound malaise each night at curtain time. By 1957 she had been though another divorce and remarriage, this time to the actor and director Alfred Ryder, by whom she had another daughter, Rachel. Her children survive her, along with a brother, Justin, and three grandchildren.         By the end of the 50's there were other signs of trouble. In 1958 she appeared with Helen Hayes and the British actor Eric Portman in ''A Touch of the Poet'' by Eugene O'Neill. Atkinson hailed Ms. Stanley and Ms. Hayes as ''the two finest actresses of their respective generations.'' Nevertheless, after opening night Ms. Stanley missed a number of performances. It was no secret by then that she and Portman were not on speaking terms, and it was no great surprise when Ms. Stanley abruptly left the play, blaming Portman for slapping her in one scene with what she said was excessive enthusiasm. Portman in turn declared, ''I don't go bashing people in the face,'' but Ms. Stanley was gone for good.         Such conflicts aside, she was still working at perfecting her art. ''To keep it fresh, I try to begin all over again in each performance,'' she told an interviewer. In 1959 she played a middle-aged woman in love with a handsome 19-year-old (Horst Buchholz) in ''Cherie,'' adapted by Anita Loos from two novels by Colette and set in France in the years just before and after World War I. Atkinson found her performance ''magnetic and illuminating.'' Two years later, in Henry Denker's semi-documentary 1961 play ''A Far Country,'' directed by her husband, Alfred Ryder, Ms. Stanley won praise as a young woman afflicted by hysterical paralysis who is helped by the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud.         In 1964 Ms. Stanley returned to the source of her first inspiration as an actress and appeared as Masha in an  Actors Studio Theater production of Chekhov's ''Three Sisters,'' directed by her old mentor, Lee Strasberg, and co-starring Geraldine Page and Shirley Knight. It was to be Ms. Stanley's last appearance on the New York stage.         The same year, in the British film thriller ''Seance on a Wet Afternoon,'' her portrayal of a sinister London medium who, with her compliant husband (Richard Attenborough), schemes to kidnap a child, won her rave reviews and an Oscar nomination as best actress. Writing in The Times, Bosley Crowther described Ms. Stanley's portrait of the woman as ''a humble, cloying shrew -- an insidiously diabolic creature, and yet a pitiful victim.'' She did not win an Oscar, although the New York Film Critics gave her their best actress award. Moviegoers were not to see her again for 18 years.         In little more than a decade she had established herself as one of Broadway's most brilliant actresses although, oddly, she never won a Tony Award. She had a number of television appearances to her credit, appearing in various dramatic series and winning an Emmy in 1963 for her work in a ''Ben Casey'' episode about mercy killing. But there were only the two Hollywood films, ''The Goddess'' and ''Seance.'' And for a long while that was the sum of her career: brilliant but all too brief. She returned to her native New Mexico, put aside the stresses of performing, did some teaching in Santa Fe and nursed her ambition to have her own ensemble of actors.         By 1979, however, she was back in New York as artistic director of a troupe of actors in a small theater in SoHo. ''I want to be involved with the great plays,'' she told an interviewer, and admitted that she missed acting and intended to act again. For one thing, she said, ''before I get too old, I'd like to do Hedda Gabler,'' and, she added, she wanted to make ''a serious film about Virginia Woolf.''         As it turned out, she did neither, but she did return to films in 1982 in ''Frances,'' in which she played the ambitious, devouring mother of the actress Frances Farmer (Jessica Lange). Her performance brought her a second Oscar nomination, this time for best supporting actress. The next year, she had a small part as a barnstorming pilot in ''The Right Stuff.'' And she returned to television in 1984, winning her second Emmy in the role of Big Mama in a PBS production of Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' with Ms. Lange and Tommy Lee Jones.         There the story ended. Ms. Stanley spent her last years quietly, back in New Mexico. ''You can't be good in the theater unless you've immersed yourself in the marvelous detective story of the human spirit,'' she once told an interviewer. ''But it's difficult, terribly difficult.''         In her case the mystery remained unsolved. She had, in effect, achieved her childhood dream of becoming the May Queen, but chose to leave the parade before its end.         Correction:  August 27, 2001, Monday  An obituary of the actress Kim Stanley on Tuesday misstated the surname of her son and misidentified his father. The son changed his name to Jamison Clift from Conway in the 1980's. His father was William Brooks Clift Jr., not Ms. Stanley's second husband, Curt Conway.         The obituary also omitted a film credit for Ms. Stanley. The Actors Studio production of ''The Three Sisters'' in which she played Masha was videotaped in 1965 and transferred to film and released in 1977.       
         Vicki Hearne, a writer who trained animals and used her poetry and prose to express her belief that pets possess courage, wisdom and intellect, died on Tuesday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. She was 55 and lived in Westbrook, Conn.         The cause was lung cancer, family members said.         Ms. Hearne, who trained animals and their owners at Silver Trails: The Animal Inn, turned her childhood love of dogs and horses into a life's work and the foundation of a philosophy of human and animal relations and communication that was articulated in her best-known book, ''Adam's Task: Calling Animals by Name'' (Knopf, 1986). In her writing she used real animals she had encountered to show that pets have not only an intellect, but also a desire to achieve and be challenged and a capacity for moral understanding.         Michiko Kakutani, in a review in The New York Times, wrote that ''Adam's Task'' ''emerges, at once, as an informed defense of animals' capacity for understanding and commitment and a philosophical meditation on the nature of learning, responsibility and language.''         Yi-Fu Tuan, in a review of ''Adam's Task'' in The New York Times Book Review, wrote that Ms. Hearne went ''out of her way to test her reader's credulity.'' He cited the book's example of a pit bull named Belle, who, he wrote, was ''capable of sizing people up 'not as bite prospects, but as problems in moral philosophy and metaphysics.' ''         ''After many excesses of this kind,'' he continued, ''I, a person who seldom can size up another metaphysically, begin to feel so inferior that I find myself retaliating by refusing to grant even the management of a 'happy grin' (as distinct from a happy smile?) to a puppy.''         And Ms. Hearne, addressing the topic from a different slant, wrote in 1984: ''These days, there is a rule among scientists against attributing human traits to animals. There used to be a rule against attributing human traits to God. So, though the definition of anthropomorphism has changed, its role as a buttress supporting the intellectual establishment's fondest superstitions has remained the same.''         Ms. Hearne may be best remembered for her defense of the much-maligned pit bull in the 1980's, when the breed's presumed ability to fight to the death was the stuff of news and urban legend. In an opinion article for The Times, she noted that an untrained eye could not always make the distinction between a pit bull and related breeds and, further, that, despite myths about lethal double jaws, pit bulls bit people less often and less seriously than many other common pets like Labrador retrievers and cocker spaniels.         In her poem ''The Bull Terrier,'' she wrote:         Their legs and backs         Should seem to be         Merely the motive         Power for the low         Broad, implacable         Jaw. They will never         Hurt a child and never         Leave justice undone,         They are justice.         She became the human hero in the story of Bandit, a dog in Stamford, Conn., who took a bite out of an intruder and ended up sentenced to death, becoming a symbol in the battle of pet owners against ordinances that banned particular breeds of dogs or put the lives of dogs deemed vicious into the hands of officials who, Ms. Hearne posited, might have a broad definition of the word.         Bandit, not a pit bull at all, but an American bulldog, endeared himself to Ms. Hearne immediately. ''Even in the most bulldoggy'' of pit bulls, she wrote, recalling the dog, ''there is something -- a sprightliness in the stance, some suggestion of the possibilities of tap dancing and vaudeville, some impish gleam of the eye to suggest the terrier.''         Bandit escaped death after Ms. Hearne challenged the authorities and won custody of the dog for three months of training. Instead of a savage beast, she found a genteel nature she described as ''terribly black tie.''         Ultimately, Bandit came to live with Ms. Hearne. Her account, ''Bandit: Dossier of a Dangerous Dog,'' was published by HarperCollins in 1991, and her experiences with Bandit were the subject of a documentary film, ''A Little Vicious.''         Victoria Elizabeth Hearne was born Feb. 13, 1946, in Austin, Tex. She worked as a self-employed animal trainer beginning in 1967. She earned a bachelor of arts degree in English at the University of California, Riverside, in 1969 and was a Stegner Fellow in Poetry at Stanford University during a year of study there.         She worked as a lecturer in creative writing at the University of California, Riverside, from 1980 to 1984 and as an assistant professor of English at Yale from 1984 to 1986. From 1989 to 1995 she was a visiting fellow at the Institution for Social and Policy Studies at Yale.         In addition to ''Adam's Task,'' she was the author of ''Animal Happiness'' (HarperCollins, 1994) and a novel, ''The White German Shepherd'' (Atlantic Monthly Press, 1988); three volumes of poetry: ''Nervous Horses'' (University of Texas Press, 1980), ''In the Absence of Horses'' (Princeton University Press, 1984) and ''The Parts of Light'' (Johns Hopkins, 1994); and many essays and articles.         She is survived by her father, Willie Hearne; her husband, Robert Tragesser; a daughter from a previous marriage, Colleen Mendelsohn; and a brother, James Hearne.       
         Diana Golden Brosnihan, who lost a leg to cancer at 12, won a gold medal in disabled skiing at the 1988 Calgary Olympics and played a key role in public appreciation of disabled athletes, died Saturday at a hospital in Providence, R.I. She was 38.         Her cancer returned in 1992 and again in 1997.         ''I like to live each day like an adventure,'' she once said.         She did that so well that Sports Illustrated once wrote that she was ''most likely to be remembered as the woman who, perhaps more than any other athlete, brought crossover credibility to the disabled sports movement.''         She was inducted into the Women's Sports Foundation International Hall of Fame in 1997. The citation read, ''She persuaded the ski world to treat all athletes the same, regardless of ability or, in her case, disability.'' She was also inducted into the National Ski Hall of Fame that year.         Brosnihan, who grew up in Lincoln, Mass., outside Boston, learned to ski at 5. At 12, she developed bone cancer in her right leg, resulting in amputation above the knee. When she awakened after surgery, her first words were, ''Will I still be able to ski?'' Six months later, she was skiing.         As a high school sophomore, she discovered that she could jog on crutches. In her junior year, the high school ski coach asked her to join the team. She did, and a year later she won the downhill in the world handicapped championships.         ''If you had ever told me that I would make being an athlete my profession, I would have laughed at you, and my family would have laughed at you,'' she once said. ''It was not even a dream.'' But it became a reality. It also became an albatross, and from 1982 to 1985, she took two and a half years off from skiing.         ''It gave me time to find my identity apart from my skiing so that when I came back to skiing it was something I wanted to do for me and not because I needed that image from other people,'' she said.         She used one ski and two outriggers (forearm crutches with ski tips attached). Later, never using an artificial leg, she abandoned the outriggers in favor of regular ski poles so she could go faster.         She rejoined the national disabled team and persuaded potential corporate sponsors to support the team as they would any other. She persuaded the United States Ski Association to allow disabled skiers to compete in national championships against able-bodied skiers.         That open-competition policy became known as the Golden Rule, and she took advantage of it. She might finish last, 20 seconds behind a renowned skier like Tamara McKinney, but said she would come closer next time. She often did.         Against other disabled skiers, her success was overwhelming. From 1986 to 1990, she won 10 world and 19 United States championships. In the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, when disabled skiing was a demonstration sport, she won the gold medal in the giant slalom. The United States Olympic Committee voted her the female skier of the year, ahead of able-bodied skiers.         In 1991, the Women's Sports Foundation gave her the Flo Hyman award, which had previously gone to Martina Navratilova, Evelyn Ashford, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Chris Evert.         That year, she retired (for the last time) from competition and took up rock climbing and mountaineering. Then the cancer returned, leading to bilateral mastectomies, the loss of her uterus and an attempted suicide. Again, she turned herself around, climbed Mount Rainier and continued as a motivational speaker.         In 1997, the cancer returned again and spread to her spine, pelvis and lungs. She stopped giving motivational speeches, saying she could not be upbeat anymore and could not force a smile.         At Dartmouth, where she received a degree in English literature in 1984, she casually met Steve Brosnihan, who became a freelance cartoonist for New England newspapers. They met again in 1996 and were married in August 1997 between her chemotherapy sessions.         She is survived by her husband, of Bristol, R.I., her mother, a brother and a sister.         To the end, Brosnihan fought for dignified treatment and perceptions of the disabled. ''You think about women,'' she said, ''and people used to pat us on the back and say: 'Isn't that sweet? She's competing.' Now they don't do that anymore. It's the same with the disabled. People treat us with dignity.         ''To me it has to do with the dignity of each person. Each person is worthy of respect, so it's a matter of if I choose to live with that dignity myself.         ''Sometimes, stereotypes make me laugh. Like when people introduce you as courageous. Often, I've heard it on television, 'We're talking with a girl today who had cancer when she was 12, beat the odds and now she skis.' I say: 'Now wait a minute. I don't just ski. I'm the best in the world and I train my heart and soul out for this and I ski 150 days and I work out in the weight room, and to me courageous doesn't imply any of that.'         ''Athletes don't want to be courageous. They want to be good.''         In 1988, she skied on screen for three minutes in a feature-length movie, ''Escape to Ski.'' Warren Miller, who made the film, became an instant fan.         ''After you're with her for a few minutes, you totally forget her handicap,'' he said. ''She has her act together, and it's not an act.''       
         Jane Greer, whose dolorous but luminous dark eyes and world-weary beauty made her the ideal femme fatale opposite Robert Mitchum in ''Out of the Past'' and ''The Big Steal,'' film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday in Los Angeles.  She was 76.         The cause was complications of cancer, her son Alex Lasker said.  When ''Out of the Past'' was remade 37 years later as ''Against All Odds,'' she came out of semi-retirement to play the mother of the character she had originally played in 1947.         She was never a big star, at least not by the standards of her day, and she was mostly relegated to melodramas. But when a later generation of movie buffs became attracted to Hollywood's black-and-white twisty yarns of the 1940's, they were quite taken by Miss Greer, whose face was best viewed through cigarette smoke in a bar.         In ''Out of the Past,'' she appears with both Mitchum and Kirk Douglas, who plays the heavy, Mitchum's former employer. Mitchum is trying to forget about his shabby past but is recruited by his old boss and ordered to Mexico to find Miss Greer.         The movie's crosses and double- crosses were nowhere nearly as opaque as those of ''The Maltese Falcon,'' but when Bosley Crowther reviewed it for The New York Times, he wrote that its 97 minutes of back stabbing and double-dealing were such that they had to be ''reckoned by logarithmic tables.''         Bettejane Greer was born on Sept. 9, 1924, in Washington. She started her show business career as a big band singer. During World War II, when she was about 19, her mother, who worked for the War Department, saw to it that Jane was one of three young women selected to model uniforms for the new Women's Army Corps.         Howard Hughes, the movie maker with a legendary affinity for beautiful women, saw her photograph and signed her to a personal contract. He made it clear that he didn't want her to marry anyone.         ''I found him rather endearing, like a child,''Miss Greer said of Hughes in one interview. ''His idea was to go to the amusement park,'' she said, adding, ''He won a large collection of Kewpie dolls for me.''         The photograph of Miss Greer in a WAC uniform was published in Life magazine, where it attracted the attention of Rudy Vallee, the crooner.  He called Life and tried unsuccessfully to get her address.         He found it anyhow, and proposed after a whirlwind courtship. Miss Greer accepted. The marriage lasted from 1943 to 1945. Miss Greer dropped the ''Bette'' from her name, and since she didn't think that Mr. Hughes had been using her to her best advantage at R.K.O., bought back her contract for $7,572, payable at $25 a week. When she was almost paid up, she asked Mr. Hughes to forgive the last $50. He refused.         She married Edward Lasker in 1947, the same year she made ''Out of the Past'' and ''They Won't Believe Me,'' with Robert Young and Susan Hayward; they were later divorced.         Among her other movies were ''I Married a Communist'' (1949) with Paul Lukas and Robert Ryan; ''Somebody Loves Me'' (1952), ''Down Among the Sheltering Palms'' (1952) and ''Run for the Sun'' (1956) with Richard Widmark and Trevor Howard, all made at MGM.         In 1957, she also appeared with James Cagney in ''Man of a Thousand Faces,'' the story of Lon Chaney, the silent star. After ''Billie,'' which she made in 1965 with Patty Duke and Jim Backus, she made few movies.         In addition to her son Alex, she is survived by two other sons, Lawrence and Steve; a twin brother, Don, and two grandchildren. Her companion, Frank London, an acting coach, died in January.         Years later, when one of her sons told her that she was ''Queen of Film Noir,'' she told him she really didn't know what film noir was.       
         Dame Dorothy Tutin, one of the most versatile and admired of British actresses, died on Monday in London, where she lived. She was 71.         She had been suffering from leukemia, said her agent, Michael Whitehall.         During her long and rich career, Ms. Tutin played almost all of Shakespeare's leading female roles, from Ophelia and Juliet to Portia and Lady Macbeth. She also did a full range of plays by Chekhov, Ibsen and Strindberg, played Sally Bowles in the London production of ''I Am a Camera,'' and acted in plays by John Osborne and Harold Pinter.         In her roles, she projected a quiet elegance, whether she was playing queens, which she often did, or commoners. Although she was petite (5 foot 3), she could be majestic, a commanding presence with a distinctive mellifluous voice. For her performances, she won a mantel-full of awards. Last year she was made a dame, joining Judi Dench, Maggie Smith and other actresses of equal stature.         Her theatrical breakthrough came in 1953 when she played the painfully neurotic wife in Graham Greene's first play, ''The Living Room.'' Writing about her, Kenneth Tynan said ''Miss Tutin's performance is masterly: the very nakedness of acting. In her greatest sorrow she blazes like a diamond in a mine.'' On various stages -- at the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Royal Court, the National Theater and on the West End -- she continued to blaze for the rest of the 20th century.         She was born in London. As a young woman, she studied music, but was unsure about a career until her father suggested that she apply to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. Although she failed her first audition, she was soon accepted. After making her professional debut in ''The Thistle and the Rose'' in 1949, she joined the Bristol Old Vic. Her work at the Old Vic in London led to her first movie role as Cecily opposite Michael Redgrave in the 1952 film of ''The Importance of Being Earnest.''         Although she later played Polly Peachum in Laurence Olivier's film of ''The Beggar's Opera'' and was in ''The Shooting Party'' with James Mason and John Gielgud, most of her acting was in the theater.         In the 1950's, after ''The Living Room,'' she played, among other roles, Sally Bowles, Joan of Arc in ''The Lark,'' Archie Rice's daughter (opposite Olivier) in ''The Entertainer,'' and a panoply of Shakespearean characters at Stratford-on-Avon. An actress of unquenchable modesty, she once said, ''Shakespeare is so rich and complex that you know perfectly well you can never do it well enough . . . but it's good to play something beyond you in every way.''         In 1963 she came to Broadway in the Shakespeare anthology ''The Hollow Crown.'' Two years later she scored a London success as Queen Victoria in ''Portrait of a Queen.'' In 1968 she and her husband Derek Waring (as Prince Albert) brought the play to Broadway.         She is survived by her husband, their daughter, Amanda, and son,  Nicholas, both of whom are actors.         Frequently, she diversified her career by undertaking contemporary roles, in 1971 playing the wife in the original London production of Harold Pinter's ''Old Times.'' Reviewing the play, Harold Clurman said that all three actors, Vivien Merchant, Ms. Tutin and Colin Blakely ''not only express the play but seem to contain it in its incisiveness, its own kind of elegance and its brilliant mystery.''         Later she acted in a revival of ''A Kind of Alaska'' by Mr. Pinter and in the premiere production of his ''Party Time.'' She also starred opposite John Wood in Tom Stoppard's adaptation of Arthur Schnitzler's ''Undiscovered Country'' at Britain's National Theater. In 1989 she played the actress Desiree in a revival of ''A Little Night Music.''         Throughout her life, she remained devoted to the stage. Explaining that commitment and her desire to be challenged, she said, ''The marvelous thing about the theater is that it happens that night and it dies every night with you and the next morning it's all to be done again. I hate anything permanent.''       
         Ethel Redner Scull, who with her husband, Robert, achieved fame and social status in the 1960's by building one of the first major collections of Pop and Minimal art and becoming the subject of an Andy Warhol portrait, died on Monday at a retirement home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack followed by a stroke, her son Jonathan said.         Once an ardent partygoer and a devoted fashion buff, Mrs. Scull lived with her husband in an art-filled apartment on upper Fifth Avenue and wore creations by designers like Halston, Adolfo and Yves St. Laurent. But after the Skulls divorced in 1975, she had to curtail her way of life, eventually moving to a small one-bedroom East Side apartment.         Her parting with Scull, a taxi tycoon, after a 30-year marriage, involved her in more than a decade of litigation with him and with his estate; he died in 1986 at 70. One of her major grievances, she said, was that although she had fully participated in their art purchases, her husband tried to take sole credit for them.         After they parted in 1974, she told an interviewer in 1986, she could not get access to 35 paintings he had earlier put in storage when their apartment was being redecorated. And she had ''not enough for a sea urchin to live on,'' she said.         In the litigation she went after what she said was rightly hers: half the paintings, property and money that the couple had acquired. In 1985 a State Supreme Court justice finally awarded her a 35 percent share in Scull's art holdings, including $2.5 million worth of paintings and more than $1 million in cash from paintings sold since 1973.         Both sides met at a warehouse to divide the works in 1986. By the flip of a coin, Mrs. Scull won one of the most important, Jasper Johns's 1959 ''Out the Window.'' Later that year she sold it at auction for $3.63 million, then the highest amount paid for a work by a living artist. Calling its departure devastating, Ms. Scull said, ''I'm losing the Johns because I need money to live on.''         But prolonged physical therapy for a back injury and a penchant for spending, her son said, gradually ate up the money and her alimony. Meanwhile her active social life ground to a halt. ''When you're not giving parties and not having the big shots of the world over, you're not invited,'' she said. ''And if your name is not in the columns, you fade away from the scene.''         Besides Jonathan, of Manhattan, Mrs. Scull is survived by two other sons, Adam, of Miami Beach, and Stephen Paul, of Los Angeles; a sister, Lillian Kaplan of New York and Florida; and two grandchildren.         Ethel Redner was born in the Bronx in 1921. Her father, Ben Redner, owned a taxicab company, and she led a privileged life. A tall, striking woman with a mane of tawny hair, she met her future husband, when she was 23.         At the time she was studying advertising art at the Parsons School of Design, which she described as ''more of a finishing school then.'' In 1944, after a five-month courtship, she married Scull, who had dropped out of high school during the Depression and had an up-and-down career as a freelance illustrator and industrial designer.         At first the couple lived in a small apartment near the Museum of Modern Art, and Mrs. Scull studied at the Art Students League, where she painted realist canvases.         When her father retired, he gave shares in the business to his three sons-in-law. Within a few years Scull had built up his share into a fleet of 130 cabs with 400 drivers. By that time the couple lived in a house in Great Neck, N.Y., bought for them by Mrs. Scull's father. But the couple were culturally and socially ambitious and soon began looking for a larger theater than suburbia.         At Mrs. Scull's prompting, they found it in Manhattan, where, with the rise of Abstract Expressionism, the art world was beginning to generate glamor and profits. At first the Sculls collected Abstract Expressionists but in the early 1960's discovered a world of newer, younger artists like Warhol, Robert Morris, Mark di Suvero and Larry Poons.         In 1965 they auctioned off part of their Abstract Expressionist collection and used the money to start the Robert and Ethel Scull Foundation for the encouragement of unknown artists. It commissioned environmental works from aspirants like Walter de Maria and Michael Heizer and gave artists stipends, bought them food and clothes and paid for their materials.         Mr. Scull also backed the Green Gallery, a showplace for innovative art founded by Richard Bellamy, for the five years of its existence.         Their patronage established the Sculls, at first considered upstarts in the art world, as big-time players. Giving lavish parties themselves, they soon were celebrities.         Gossip and art writers sought them out, and Mrs. Scull regularly made the fashion pages. In 1963 Warhol did her portrait, ''Ethel Scull 36 Times,'' comprising 36 silk-screen images made from snapshots taken in a Times Square photo booth. The couple was cast in plaster by the sculptor George Segal, with Mrs. Scull wearing a Courrèges dress. They established a base in East Hampton, N.Y., then the art world's summer summit.         But in 1973, when they auctioned 50 works by up-and-coming artists for $2.2 million, at the time a record for contemporary American art, they were castigated by some artists and critics, among them Robert Rauschenberg, because they had acquired the art so cheaply. Mr. Rauschenberg accused the Sculls of infidelity and the auction house of encouraging profiteering.         Later, asked by an interviewer about accusations that he and his wife bought art for investment and for social climbing, Mr. Scull replied: ''It's all true. I'd rather use art to climb than anything else.''       
         Barbara Matera, a costumer who for five decades dressed the casts of the New York City Ballet, the Metropolitan Opera, movies and more than 100 Broadway shows, died on Thursday at the New York University Medical Center in New York. She was 72 and had homes in Manhattan and Athens, N.Y.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said her husband, Arthur.         Long considered an exemplar of her craft, Ms. Matera took the sketches of designers and breathed life into them, creating costumes the legendary showman David Merrick once called the best he had ever seen on Broadway. Barbara Matera Ltd., the shop she founded in 1968 with her husband, produced the costumes seen in the current Broadway productions of ''Beauty and the Beast,''  ''Aida,''  ''The Lion King,''  ''Kiss Me, Kate,''  ''42nd Street'' and the forthcoming ''Mamma Mia.''         Born Barbara Gray in Kent, England, Ms. Matera began her career in the costume shops of the Adelphi Players, Covent Garden, the Ballet Romberg, Stratford-on-Avon and the Old Vic. She moved to the United States in 1960.         Here, she became the archetypal costumer in the worlds of opera, ballet, theater and film, collaborating with the designers Irene Sharaff, her mentor; Theoni V. Aldredge; Patricia Zipprodt; Tony Walton; Julie Taymor; William Ivey Long; Freddy Wittop; and Desmond Healy.         Armed with bolts of fabric, she would enter her workroom and begin her magic, draping and fitting her clients in a way that accentuated their assets and diminished their flaws. Always, her work had something secret and special: beneath a crinoline or a tutu, for instance, she would tuck a tiny silk rosebud.         As the costumer for the American Ballet Theater, Ms. Matera outfitted the soloists and corps of ''Swan Lake,''  ''Othello,''  ''Snow Maiden,''  ''Theme and Variations'' and ''Gaieté Parisienne.'' For the New York City Ballet, she not only constructed and refurbished costumes, but designed them for productions including ''Sinfonia Mistica,''  ''Tanspiel,''  ''Five,'' and ''Baroque Variations.''         She also dressed the dance companies of Paul Taylor, David Parsons, Lar Lubovitch and Eliot Feld, and the San Francisco and Houston Ballets.         But it was her work on more than 100 Broadway plays and musicals for which Ms. Matera was perhaps most acclaimed, particularly the original 1972 production of ''Follies,'' whose lavish costumes won their designer, Florence Klotz, a Tony Award and increased the adulation of Merrick. Later, she would make the costumes for his ''42nd Street.''         Ms. Matera's Broadway credits include ''A Chorus Line,''  ''A Little Night Music,''  ''La Cage aux Folles,''  ''Dreamgirls,''  ''Sunday in the Park With George,''  ''Sugar Babies,''  ''Nine,''  ''City of Angels,''  ''Angels in America,''  ''Into the Woods,''  ''Grand Hotel,''  ''Crazy for You,''  ''Sunset Boulevard'' and the recent revival of ''Annie Get Your Gun.''         Among her film credits are ''The Great Gatsby,''  ''Death on the Nile,''         ''The Age of Innocence,''  ''The Addams Family,''  ''Moonstruck'' and  ''Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.''         But her work was not limited to show business. She outfitted performers as disparate as Dame Joan Sutherland and Mick Jagger. She also made the purple crystal-encrusted gown that Hillary Rodham Clinton wore at her husband's first presidential inauguration.         Ms. Matera's work was the subject of a 1996 exhibition at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts titled ''Inside and Out: The Costumes of Barbara Matera.''         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Pauline Ritchie-Fallon, of Lymington, England.       
         Sallie M. Wheeler, an Anheuser-Busch heiress who led a successful campaign to return the nation's oldest and most prestigious horse show to Manhattan, died on Friday at her home in Keswick, Va. She was 70.         Mrs. Wheeler, a lifelong equestrian, led efforts to return the National Horse Show to Madison Square Garden after it moved to the Meadowlands in New Jersey in 1989. With its audience full of black ties and evening gowns, the show had been a highlight of the high society calendar. But, facing financial burdens, it began to lose its luster in the 1980's.         The show, a Manhattan mainstay since 1883, relocated to the Meadowlands amid rumors of impending bankruptcy. In New Jersey, the show increased in size and eliminated its debt but began to lose what Mrs. Wheeler saw as its greatest asset: its prestige.         Mrs. Wheeler believed the National Horse Show was synonymous with its original location, Madison Square Garden. Throughout the show's history, and even during its seven years at the Meadowlands, fans referred to the show as simply the Garden. The horse show is among four events that have been held at the four different Madison Square Garden buildings. Mrs. Wheeler contributed her time and fortune to make sure it went back there.         With much fanfare, the show returned to the Garden in 1996. To herald its homecoming, Mrs. Wheeler arranged for Seventh Avenue to be shut for a parade of Budweiser Clydesdales.         The heyday of the show was over, however. What was once a weeklong event was condensed into four days and eventually into two and a half. And its stature in the New York social scene was only partly restored.         Mrs. Wheeler's love of horses stemmed from her childhood. She was born Sallie Marie Busch on Aug. 22, 1931, in St. Louis to Catherine Milliken Busch and Adolphus Busch III, who became president of Anheuser-Busch in 1934.         Mr. Busch and his brother, August A. Busch Jr., were partners at the brewery and were accomplished horsemen. As a child growing up on Grant's Farm, once the home of Ulysses S. Grant, Sallie rode horses, and when her father died in 1946, August Busch helped rear her. She began to ride competitively, and at 15, she made her first National Horse Show appearance.         Supported by her stake in the family company, Sallie made a living of her love of horses. In 1965, she married Kenneth M. Wheeler, a professional horse trainer. During their more than 35 years of marriage, they raised and trained hundreds of champion horses at their farm in Keswick and participated in equestrian shows around the country.         Among the most prominent and successful exhibitors in the horse world, the Wheelers won thousands of blue ribbons, an average of 200 to 300 each year. In 1987, the American Horse Shows Association named Mrs. Wheeler its horsewoman of the year. In 1999, the organization gave the Wheelers its lifetime achievement award.         Upon receiving that award, Mrs. Wheeler said: ''It is rare that two people have so fully enjoyed a career in a profession and a hobby in a sport such as Kenny and I have been privileged to. We both realize that none of this would be possible without the fabulous animals we do dearly love and appreciate.''         Mrs. Wheeler's first marriage, to Robert Motch, ended with his death.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Wheeler is survived by five children, Sallie M. Motch of Cold Spring, N.Y., Robert Motch of Carthage, Mo., Kenneth M. Wheeler Jr. of Memphis, Gordon L. Wheeler of Harrodsburg, Ky., and Douglas B. Wheeler of Keswick, Va., and nine grandchildren.       
         Dorothy McGuire, who came to Hollywood from Broadway to repeat her 1941 stage success in the title role in ''Claudia,'' and went on to have a long and distinguished film career playing sensitive, intelligent and steadfast women, died yesterday in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 83.         Miss McGuire broke her leg three weeks ago and then developed arrhythmia, said her daughter, Mary Hackett Swope.         Miss McGuire is perhaps best remembered for her portrayal of Katie Nolan, the mother in the 1945 film of Betty Smith's novel ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn.'' Dealing with the hardships of tenement life in Williamsburg, the film marked Elia Kazan's directorial debut in Hollywood. It also starred James Dunn, who won an Oscar as best supporting actor for his performance as Miss McGuire's doomed husband; Peggy Ann Garner, who received a special Oscar for her role as their daughter Francie; Joan Blondell; and Lloyd Nolan.         The following year, Miss McGuire gave what Leonard Maltin and other critics called ''an unforgettable performance'' in Robert Siodmak's ''Spiral Staircase,'' playing a mute  servant menaced in a strange household that might be harboring a psychopathic killer.         In 1947 Mr. Kazan summoned her again, this time to play opposite Gregory Peck in Moss Hart's adaption of ''Gentlemen's Agreement,'' Laura Z. Hobson's novel about anti-Semitism. The film earned an Academy Award for best picture, and Mr. Kazan received his first Oscar as best director. Celeste Holm won an Oscar as best supporting actress for the film, and Miss McGuire was nominated for best actress but lost to Loretta Young in ''The Farmer's Daughter.''         Another signature role that showcased Miss McGuire's ability to project simplicity, warmth and forbearance was that of the wife of Jess Birdwell (Gary Cooper) and the mother of Josh Birdwell (Anthony Perkins) in ''Friendly Persuasion,'' William Wyler's 1956 film about a Quaker family living in southern Indiana during the Civil War.         Miss McGuire remained strongly interested in the stage long after she established herself as a movie actress. In the mid-1940's, she, Mr. Peck, Jennifer Jones, Joseph Cotten, Mel Ferrer and other actors formed  the La Jolla Players, a repertory company in California. Over the years, she also appeared in several stage productions in New York, including an adaptation of Sherwood Anderson's ''Winesburg, Ohio'' in 1958 and Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' in 1976. Walter Kerr, reviewing ''The Night of the Iguana'' for The New York Times, said Miss McGuire played the role of the spinster ''with great charm and intelligence.''         Dorothy Hackett McGuire was born on June 14, 1918, in Omaha, Neb., the daughter of Thomas Johnson McGuire, a lawyer, and Isabelle Flaherty McGuire. She showed an early talent for the stage and began to act in the Omaha Little Theater.  Her parents' marriage failed, and after her father's death when she was 14, she was sent to a convent school in Indianapolis, where she pursued her interest in acting and played the role of the Virgin Mary in one production. (Years later, she was cast again as the Virgin Mary in George Stevens's 1965 film, ''The Greatest Story Ever Told.'') After leaving the convent school, she went to Pine Manor Junior College in Wellesley, Mass., where she was president of the Mimes and Masks drama club.         Graduating from Pine Manor at 19, she came to New York, determined to work as an actress while supporting herself as a model. If anyone asked what she liked to do in her spare time, she would say that she enjoyed Edna St. Vincent Millay's poetry and Debussy's music.         In 1938 she got a break of sorts, when she was selected to be Martha Scott's understudy in Thornton Wilder's hit play ''Our Town.'' When Miss Scott went to Hollywood, Miss McGuire took over the role. She did well, but the critics had already seen the play, and her efforts went largely unnoticed, except by her fellow actors. In the late 1930's she played in the road company of ''My Dear Children'' (a vehicle for John Barrymore) and appeared with Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong and Maxine Sullavan in ''Swingin' the Dream,'' a musical version of Shakespeare's ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' that flopped.         But in 1941 she heard that the producer John Golden and the author Rose Franken were looking for someone to play the title role in ''Claudia,'' Miss Franken's play  about a child-wife. Miss Franken and Mr. Golden had already auditioned  and rejected 208 actresses for the role, made familiar by Miss Franken's 2 novellas and 22 short stories about the character.         Miss McGuire was so intimidated by the prospect of auditioning for the role that she almost didn't try out. She knew that she tended to be rather mechanical when she read lines for the first time and didn't think Miss Franken would approve of her. But Miss Franken saw through the stiffness of the audition and concluded that Miss McGuire would be perfect for the part.         She was right; the production was a great success. Writing in The Times, Brooks Atkinson said that although Miss McGuire was ''a little inexperienced as an actress, she is personally genuine; the charm she radiates across the play is not merely a theater mannerism.''         Miss McGuire's appearance in ''Claudia'' earned her a special award from the Drama League for the best performance in 1941 by a young actor. She went on tour with the play in June 1942 and a year later arrived in Hollywood to recreate the role on film with Robert Young as her husband, David. ''Claudia'' was a hit, and so was its sequel, ''Claudia and David,'' in which Claudia becomes a mother.         The next two decades proved to be especially productive for Miss McGuire. Among her films were ''The Enchanted Cottage'' (1945), in which she and Young starred again, and  ''Till the End of Time'' (1946), in which she played a war widow, and Robert Mitchum and Guy Madison portrayed veterans trying to cope with civilian life. In 1950 she toured with the La Jolla Players in Tennessee Williams's ''Summer and Smoke,'' and also starred with Burt Lancaster and Edmund Gwenn in ''Mister 880,'' a charming movie about a small-time counterfeiter.         In 1951 she returned to Broadway to appear opposite the young Richard Burton in ''Legend of Lovers,''  Kitty Black's adaptation of a play by  Jean Anouilh. Although critics liked Miss McGuire, they did not approve of the production, and it closed after only 22 performances.         Her other films included ''Invitation'' (1952), ''Three Coins in the Fountain'' (1954), ''Trial'' (1955), ''A Summer Place'' (1959) and William Inge's ''Dark At the Top of the Stairs'' (1960). During this period she also acted in television, especially for the Hallmark Theater.         She also had roles in the films ''Mother Didn't Tell Me'' (1950), ''I Want You'' (1951), ''Callaway Went Thataway'' (1951), ''Make Haste to Live'' (1953), ''This Earth Is Mine'' (1959), ''The Remarkable Mr. Pennypacker'' (1959), ''Swiss Family Robinson'' (1960) and ''Flight of the Doves'' (1971). She was a voice actor in ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull'' (1973).         Miss McGuire was married to John Swope, a photographer and producer who died in 1979. Miss McGuire is survived by her daughter and a son, Mark Swope.         After her husband's death, she accepted fewer roles. But she did appear in a Los Angeles production of Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest'' in 1982 and in Phil Penningroth's ''Ghost Dancing,'' a 1983 television movie in which she played a frail, eccentric widowed farmer  who dynamites a reservoir in a battle over water.         Reviewing it in The Times, John O'Connor said that Miss McGuire was ''an actress whose presence has been unfailingly elegant'' and that she gave ''a performance of powerful dignity.'' It was praise she was used to hearing.       
         Kay Teer Crawford, whose sympathy for high school girls who did not make the cheerleading squad in her Texas hometown led her to start one of the first of the drill teams, died on Aug. 29 at her home in Redondo Beach, Calif. She was 88.         Her son Kim said the reason earlier reports of her death listed her as 83 was that she had lopped five years off her age when she was 75 to increase her employment opportunities. Almost until her death, she actively promoted drill teams not just as entertainment but as a sport.         Mrs. Crawford, a cheerleader herself, came up with the concept of having sequined young women prancing about at sporting events around the time Gussie Nell Davis had the same idea with her Flaming Flashes in Greenville, Tex. Miss Davis went on to form the celebrated Kilgore Rangerettes of Kilgore College in Kilgore, Tex.         A Kilgore College history reports that Miss Davis began the Greenville troupe in 1928, two years before Mrs. Crawford started the Sergeanettes at Edinburg High School in Edinburg, Tex. But Janet Mar, Mrs. Crawford's personal assistant, insists that her boss was first with the inimitable combination of high-spirited marching, dancing and kicking that became an American tradition.         Whatever the chronology, Mrs. Crawford's contribution to the world of drill teams looms large. She brought the idea from Texas to Southern California, where she spent many years adding show-business glamour to plain old Texas strutting. She provided drill teams for 10 Super Bowls, 4 Rose Bowls and 7 Pro Bowls, and at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, she put 1,268 drill team members through their lively paces.         Two years later, at the rededication of the Statue of Liberty, she fielded a team almost that large, including all-stars from every state. The next year, she helped orchestrate a celebration surrounding a mass by Pope John Paul II at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.         David Wolper, who produced the Olympic and Statue of Liberty shows, said: ''Kay recruited, trained and prepared thousands of young drill team girls for the events, and when Kay trained them, they were perfect. We have lost a real champion.''         Kay Waweehie Teer, whose mother was half-Cherokee and half-Comanche, was born on a farm near Granger, Tex., on Aug. 16, 1914. Her father moved off the farm to become the sheriff of Hidalgo County, Tex., where he made his wife and only child deputies so they could travel with him over the vast territory on official business.         He died shortly after moving to Edinburg to take a different law enforcement job. Mrs. Crawford and her mother then squatted in a succession of vacant houses, stealing from gardens to eat. Eventually, they moved in with relatives.         Mrs. Crawford won a coveted cheerleader position, but hated facing the envy and resentment of the 90 girls who did not make it. Inspired by the marching of Reserve Officer Training Corps cadets at a nearby junior college, she asked her principal to start what she at first called a spirit group, something that all the girls could join the next year. Her idea was accepted, and the Sergeanettes took the field in the fall of 1930.         ''All of the women were included,'' Ms. Mar said. ''Nobody got left out.''         Mrs. Crawford then worked her way through what is now Pan American University, where she earned an associate's degree, while cleaning toilets for money and wearing damaged clothing to make ends meet. She earned a bachelor's degree from Baylor University and a master's degree from the University of Texas, writing a thesis titled, ''The Educational Value of Drill Teams in the High School Curriculum.''         She took her drill team idea to El Centro High School in El Centro, Calif., and from there to San Diego High School and Santa Monica High School. She added props, from canes to matador capes, and persuaded a friend in the fabric business to develop nylon pompoms as a more versatile substitute for paper ones.         She then taught physical education and coached drill teams at Santa Monica College, whose president, Richard Moore, said, ''With her batons, hats and costumes, she established college pride, no matter what the prowess of the athletic crew.''         Mrs. Crawford coached cheerleaders for the University of Southern California, the University of California at Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League and the Los Angeles Express of the defunct United States Football League.         She opened a drill team summer camp, started an international competition for drill teams, founded and edited a magazine on the subject of drill teams, and wrote what some consider the definitive textbook on the subject.         Her husband, James H. Crawford, died several years ago after 54 years of marriage. A teetotaler, Mrs. Crawford met him while she was volunteering to greet returning veterans at a bar; he was the one wearing a marine uniform while drinking a glass of milk, their son Kim said.         Mrs. Crawford is survived by Kim, who lives in Dana Point, Calif.; another son, Jay, of Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.; a daughter, Jan Crawford of Torrance, Calif.; nine grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Crawford did not achieve her loftiest ambition. She had been heartily campaigning to make drill team competitions an Olympic sport.       
         Gloria Foster, the distinguished stage actress who portrayed generations of African-American characters in plays like ''In White America'' and ''Having Our Say,'' died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was diabetes, said Clarence Williams 3rd, her former husband.         Born in Chicago and reared by her grandmother, Ms. Foster studied at the Goodman Theater School of Drama and made her professional debut in the County Theater at the University of Chicago.         In 1963 she moved to New York and walked into an open audition for Martin B. Duberman's ''In White America,'' a dramatic overview of the black American experience from life aboard 18th-century slave ships to the 20th-century crusade for civil rights.         Soft-spoken and polite and with a Mona Lisa smile, Ms. Foster won her role over dozens of seasoned New York actresses. She soon found herself onstage at the Sheridan Square Theater in Greenwich Village, portraying no fewer than 27 characters.         It was a performance that won her ample attention from New York critics and producers. Writing in The New York Times, Howard Taubman called Ms. Foster ''the most moving of all'' the actors in the play. He later wrote that she ''shook New York'' in that role. In particular he cited her portrayal of the teenage black girl who was the first to integrate Central High in Little Rock, Ark. Life magazine also singled out the scene, and later published a two-page spread on Ms. Foster. She won an Obie Award for that performance, one of three she would receive.         Judith Rutherford James, who produced ''In White America,'' soon cast Ms. Foster again, in 1965, this time as Medea at the Martinique Theater on West 32nd Street, an Off Broadway house that has since vanished. That performance won Ms. Foster another Obie in addition to a Theater World Award, and officially established her as a formidable classical actress.         In later decades, Ms. Foster took on a range of classical roles, including Titania and Hippolyta in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' Andromache in ''The Trojan Women'' and the mother in ''Blood Wedding.'' Many of these productions were produced under the auspices of the New York Shakespeare Festival, whose longtime producer, Joseph Papp, also cast Ms. Foster as modern-day characters, including Miss Molly Hoffenburg in Bill Gunn's ''Forbidden City,'' for which she won a third Obie in 1989.         Perhaps more than awards, however, Ms. Foster's career was notable for the directorial talent that sought her out, including Andrei Serban, who chose her for his Clytemnestra in ''Agamemnon,'' in a 1977 production at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, and Joseph Chaikin, who cast her as the central character in ''Trespassing,'' in 1982.         Ms. Foster also worked in film and television, playing a supporting role in the movie ''Nothing but a Man'' (1964). Younger hipster audiences were later introduced to Ms. Foster in the 1999 hit ''The Matrix,'' in which she played the Oracle, a mystical seer who sends the movie's hero (played by Keanu Reeves) on his reality-bending mission.         Though familiar Off Broadway, Ms. Foster became famous on Broadway in 1995 as Sadie Delany, the gracious 103-year-old whose story, and that of her more vinegary 101-year-old sister, Bessie, was told in Emily Mann's ''Having Our Say.''         The play, based on the sisters' best-selling memoir, opened at the Booth Theater to near-unanimous good reviews, including stellar notices for Ms. Foster and her co-star, Mary Alice. So seamless were the performances that audience members standing at the stage door often mistook the two actresses for the actual centenarians, offering to help Ms. Foster and Ms. Alice navigate the sidewalk.         In 1999 Ms. Foster made her last appearance, in a revival of ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' alongside Ruben Santiago-Hudson, at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts. Again, as she had throughout her career, Ms. Foster turned her natural reserve into a strength as Lena Younger, the matriarch at the play's center. The mother is the last to leave the stage, a moment that was tailor-made for Ms. Foster's quiet power.         No immediate family members survive.       
         The statuesque performer who won fame as Dagmar, a dumb-as-a-fox blonde on one of television's first late-night shows, died on Tuesday at her home in Ceredo, W.Va. She was 79.         She was born Virginia Ruth Egnor in nearby Huntington and was renamed Jenny Lewis when she came to New York to model and act. She was given the name Dagmar when she became a character in ''Broadway Open House,'' a vaudeville-style mix of music and jokes, which ran on NBC in 1950 and 1951 and was a forerunner of ''The Tonight Show.''         Standing 5 feet 11 inches in her heels, Dagmar combined ''the voluptuous curves of a Venus, the provocative grace of a young Mae West and the virtue of a Girl Scout,'' Murray Schumach wrote in The New York Times in 1950.         Not to say that sexual innuendo was ignored. Once when she played the president in a comedy sketch, she said: ''I've had a very busy day. I passed 19 vetoes and vetoed 19 passes.''         She was billed as a singer on the program, but seldom sang. Instead, she recited poems and treatises -- she called them treasises -- in a delightfully ingenuous, deadpan manner.         Dagmar's significance transcended beating Cher and Madonna to first-name-only status. Her necklines were debated on the floor of the House of Representatives, and when her salary soared from $75 a week to $3,000, the government's Wage Stabilization Board took public notice.         In a 1951 profile illustrated with photographs by Alfred Eisenstadt, Life magazine called her a ''national institution.''         Her casual attitude about names came early, when she asked to be called Ruthie instead of Virginia. ''It's easier to spell,'' she explained.         She graduated from Huntington High School and Huntington Business College, according to Huntington Quarterly, a local journal. She then went to work for a finance company, but quit because. she said, she felt sorry for all those people''who had to pay and didn't have enough to eat.'' She also worked as a waitress, sandwich maker, soda jerk and cashier. Two of her three husbands, Angelo Lewis and Dick Hinds, a bandleader, were from Huntington. The third was Danny Dayton, an actor. All died before her.         She is survived by her sisters Jean Nichols of Miami, Mary Ann Wolfe of Huntington and Theresa Jacobs of Vancouver, Wash.; and her brothers Jack Egnor of Tuback, Ariz., Robert Joseph Egnor and Dan of Huntington.         As an aspiring actress in New York, her first job was modeling sweaters. She was hired on a show-by-show basis for the new NBC show ''Broadway Open House.'' She was told to wear a low-cut gown, sit on a stool and act dumb. When the host, Jerry Lester, asked where she was from, she smiled brightly and answered, ''West Virginia.''         ''Where's that?'' Mr. Lester demanded. She drawled, ''In West Virginia,'' convulsing the host and the audience.         Soon she was receiving 8,000 fan letters a month, more than half of them from women. She lived in a Central Park South penthouse, and was often seen in the Stork Club.         She went on to perform in the theater, summer stock and Las Vegas. She was a regular on ''Holiday Squares.'' Mitch Miller persuaded her to record a duet with Frank Sinatra.         During her run as one of television's early stars, she told an interviewer she thought she was becoming Dagmar. That meant being a ''gentlewoman among roisterers'' in Mr. Schumach's phrase.         When the heckling got out of hand as she recited yet another inane poem, Dagmar would say in a plaintive southern accent, ''Please, you're tinkering with my art.''       
         Jacqueline T. Babbin, a television producer who won an Emmy Award for ''Sybil,'' a 1976 TV drama, died on Oct. 6 at her home in Kent, Conn. She was 80.         The cause was cancer, said Shirley E. Herz, her longtime friend and former publicist.         Ms. Babbin produced dozens of shows, but it was ''Sybil,'' the story of a woman whose harrowing childhood provoked multiple personality disorder, that earned an Emmy Award for outstanding drama or comedy special. The NBC show, which won a Peabody Award as well, received four Emmys, including one for Sally Field, who had the title role.         Ms. Babbin's career spanned nearly five decades and took her from producing for the theater to doing so for films and television.         She was born in Manhattan on July 26, 1921, and graduated from Smith College in 1941. After several years  working on Broadway productions, including ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' she rose through the television ranks and became one of the first women head producers. She, in turn, hired many other women.         She produced several network television series, including ''Armstrong Circle Theater'' and ''DuPont Show of the Week.'' She also produced live television adaptations of ''The Human Voice'' (starring Ingrid Bergman), ''The Philadelphia Story,'' ''Miracle on 34th Street,'' ''The Bells of St. Mary's'' and ''The Scarlet Pimpernel.''         In 1968, Ms. Babbin established her own production company, Clovis. Under that banner, she produced CBS's ''Children's Hour'' in 1969 and won a Peabody Award for ''J.T.,'' one of its installments. Ms. Babbin also produced CBS's ''Beacon Hill,'' a short-lived but critically acclaimed 1975 series about a rich Boston family and its servants that resembled the British series ''Upstairs, Downstairs.''         Soon after ''Beacon Hill,'' Ms. Babbin became vice president of novels and mini-series at ABC. She produced ''All My Children'' from 1982 to 1986 and ''Loving'' from 1990 until her retirement a year later.         During her retirement she published two mystery novels, ''Prime Time Corpse'' (which was later renamed ''Bloody Special'') and ''Bloody Soaps.'' She was working on her third book, ''Bloody Networks,'' at her death.         Ms. Babbin's marriage in the late 1940's to Alan Shayne, a former president of Warner Brothers Television, ended in divorce. No immediate family members survive.       
         Ruth Goetz, a playwright who collaborated with her husband, Augustus Goetz, on ''The Heiress'' and other plays, died Friday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. She was 93 and had been living in the Actors' Fund Home in Englewood.         ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of the Henry James novel ''Washington Square,'' brought the Goetzes great success when it opened on Broadway in 1947. They also wrote the screenplay for the 1949 film version directed by William Wyler. The play was revived in 1995 by Lincoln Center Theater and received Tony Awards for best revival and for Cherry Jones as best actress.         Through her work with the Dramatists Guild and the Young Playwrights Festival, Mrs. Goetz became known as a mentor and encourager of young playwrights. ''Ruth would go anywhere to see a play and was always searching out new writers,'' John Guare said this week. ''She was also a wonderful keeper of the record of our times and knew who was what and when.'' Sinclair Lewis, H. L. Mencken, Dorothy Parker and George S. Kaufman were among her many friends.         She was born in Philadelphia in 1908 and had her first indoctrination into theater from her father, Philip Goodman, a theatrical producer. At the beginning of her career, she was a story editor and costume designer. After she and Mr. Goetz were married in 1931, they began writing plays together. Their first, ''Franklin Street,'' written with Arthur Sheekman and based on Mr. Goodman's autobiography, closed out of town.         Their next, ''One-Man Show,'' which had a brief run on Broadway in 1945, was set in the world of art dealers and was about the relationship between a father and daughter.         Searching for a subject, Mrs. Goetz suggested to her husband that they dramatize ''Washington Square,'' about a domineering father and his painfully shy daughter. After the couple finished the play, a producer persuaded them to contrive a happy ending, in which the daughter, Catherine, reconciles with her faithless suitor. The play, then named ''Washington Square,'' was a failure in Boston.         The Goetzes rewrote it, restoring their original ending. With Jed Harris as the director, the play was recast with Basil Rathbone as the father and Wendy Hiller as the daughter. When ''The Heiress'' opened on Broadway, Brooks Atkinson wrote a harsh review in The New York Times, saying that the James ''story cannot be dramatized.''         ''We hadn't put the novel onstage,'' Mrs. Goetz said years later. ''It was a different story -- the daughter's finding herself through her tragedy.'' Other reviews were favorable, and the play became a Broadway hit, running for 410 performances.         Soon it was an international success both on the stage and on the screen, and, Mrs. Goetz said, ''it gave James, long in his grave, the best seller he never had.'' The movie version starred Ralph Richardson, Olivia de Havilland and Montgomery Clift (as Catherine's suitor). For her performance, Ms. de Havilland won an Academy Award as best actress. The play has been revived frequently, and in 1974 it was transformed into an opera.         The Goetzes followed ''The Heiress'' with their adaptation of ''The Immoralist'' by André Gide, which opened on Broadway in 1954. In his review in The Times, Mr. Atkinson said, ''Magnificently acted by a company led by Geraldine Page and Louis Jourdan, 'The Immoralist' is an admirable piece of work that retains the integrity of Gide and does credit to the taste of the Goetzes.'' In the play, James Dean made his Broadway debut in a small role as a native houseboy.         Together, the Goetzes wrote the screenplay for, among other movies, ''Carrie'' (1952, adapted from Theodore Dreiser's ''Sister Carrie'' and starring Laurence Olivier) and ''Stage Struck'' (1957). ''The Hidden River,'' adapted from a Storm Jamison novel, starring Robert Preston, was their last Broadway collaboration. It, too, was in 1957, the year that Mr. Goetz died.         On her own, Mrs. Goetz wrote ''Sweet Love Remember'd,'' a play about her husband. During the first week of the tryout, the star, Margaret Sullavan, died, and the play closed in New Haven. Mrs. Goetz later adapted ''L'Amour Fou'' by André Roussin into ''Madly in Love.''         She is survived by her daughter, Judy Goetz Sanger, a poet, and a granddaughter, Katie Firth, an actress. Both live in Manhattan.         Speaking about the art of playwriting, Mrs. Goetz said, ''Dramatization is imagination made palpable, or visible, or understandable -- instantly.'' It is, she said, ''the imaginer's highest moment.''       
         Etta Jones, a great and permanently underrated jazz singer who for three decades toured constantly with her musical partner, the saxophonist Houston Person, died on Tuesday at her home in Mount Vernon, N.Y. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, said Joe Fields, the manager of her record label, High Note.         Born in Aiken, S.C., and reared in Harlem, Ms. Jones early on developed wily devices for a small voice.  She used silence, the sound of the breath, a quick yodel here and there, lyric readings that drew out or shut down syllables idiosyncratically, and a sliding pitch that made her an extraordinary blues singer. Billie Holiday was the most obvious and famous precedent for her style, and she was capable of astonishingly close Holiday impersonations, though she rarely let her audiences hear them.         But her hard-edged blues sensibility owed something to Dinah Washington, while her highly improvised phrasing came from horn players like Sonny Stitt. Ms. Jones always cited as an influence Thelma Carpenter, a onetime Count Basie vocalist who became a heavy-vibrato torch singer. Neither a shouter, a whisperer nor a bebopper, Ms. Jones clung fast to a set of jazz standards from the 1940's and 50's, and tunes by composers like Sammy Cahn, her favorite, whose songs are the subject of her 1999 album, ''All the Way.''         With Mr. Person, her musical partner of more than 30 years, Ms. Jones toured the country, still playing often to primarily black audiences, but also by the late 90's appearing twice a year at the Village Vanguard in Manhattan and at international jazz festivals; she was an evergreen presence in the New York jazz world, and kept up her concert schedule until two weeks before her death.         At 15, Ms. Jones sang at the Apollo Theater's amateur night in the summer of 1944, and immediately after her performance she auditioned for and won a job singing with Buddy Johnson, who led a 19-man band. Johnson's group played in a common vernacular jazz style of the 40's -- a mixture of rhythm-and-blues and jump blues -- and, as a second-tier group not as popular as the likes of Basie, Ellington and Eckstine, the band toured black-only clubs and auditoriums throughout the country.         Her job was as a temporary replacement for Ella Johnson, Buddy Johnson's sister, who was on a maternity leave. When Ella Johnson returned to the band, Ms. Jones began working for different groups until the early 1950's, among them the Harlemaires and bands, from medium-size to big, led by Barney Bigard, Pete Johnson, Earl Hines, J. C. Heard and Sonny Stitt.         In 1952 she began eight years of semiretirement, singing intermittently. Finally, in 1960, she was contracted by Prestige Records, and recorded ''Don't Go to Strangers,'' which became a Top 40, million-selling hit, changing her weekly income, as she once put it, from $50 to $750.         By the end of the 1960's, she had developed a trusting partnership with Mr. Person, a big-toned saxophonist. In performance they developed a conversational style of answering each other's lines. ''He knows exactly what I'm going to do,'' she once said. ''He knows if I'm in trouble; he'll give me the note. He leaves me room.'' They were always billed equally, an unusual arrangement for any jazz singer. Starting in 1976, they began recording for Muse, which later changed its name to High Note, and Mr. Person became her manager and record producer through 18 records.         She had three Grammy nominations, for the ''Don't Go to Strangers'' LP in 1960, ''Save Your Love for Me'' in 1981 and ''My Buddy'' in 1999. But she never recorded for a major label; her temperament was decidedly unlike a diva; and outside of the small period of time around ''Don't Go to Strangers,'' she never commanded high concert fees.         Ms. Jones is survived by her husband, John Medlock, of Washington; a granddaughter, Lia Greatheart-Mitchell of Mount Vernon; and sisters Edna Taylor of Akron, Ohio, and Georgia Johnson of Aiken.         Her new and final High Note album appeared in stores on the day she died, ''Etta Jones Sings Lady Day.''       
         Diana van der Vlis, the blond-haired, blue-eyed actress who caused a stir on Broadway in the 1950's hit ''The Happiest Millionaire,'' died on Monday in a hospital in Missoula, Mont., where she had a home. She was 66.         The cause of death was uncertain pending an autopsy, said her husband, Roger Donald, who said his wife had had respiratory problems.         A child of international origin -- she was born in Toronto to a Scottish mother and a Dutch father -- Ms. van der Vlis studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts in London and acted in Canada before moving to New York in the spring of 1956.         There, in one of her first auditions, she landed the plum role of Cordelia Biddle, daughter of Col. Anthony J. Drexel Biddle, the eccentric socialite and title character of ''The Happiest Millionaire,'' a popular comedy drawn from Ms. Biddle's memoir.         Acting opposite Walter Pidgeon, Ms. van der Vlis won the type of reviews that would secure her position as one of Broadway's most sought-after ingénues. Writing in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called her ''an uncommonly talented young lady'' who ''plunges into the temperamental whirlpool of Cordelia's adolescent emotions and makes a stunning performance out of them.'' She was nominated for a Tony Award for her performance.         Much work followed. In the next few years, Ms. van der Vlis played in the Broadway productions of ''Comes a Day,'' ''A Mighty Man Is He,'' ''A Shot in the Dark'' and Gore Vidal's ''Visit to a Small Planet.''         Ms. van der Vlis also appeared in films and on television series like  ''The Man From Uncle'' and ''The Fugitive.'' Her films included ''The Incident'' (1967) and Roger Corman's ''Man With the X-Ray Eyes'' (1963).         Later, Ms. van der Vlis also appeared in two soap operas, ''Where the Heart Is'' and ''Ryan's Hope.''         In addition to her husband, Ms. van der Vlis is survived by a son, Matthew, of Los Angeles, and a daughter, Adrienne of New York.       
         Barbara Tropp, an innovative San Francisco chef, restaurateur and author of books about cooking, died on Oct. 26 at her apartment in San Francisco. She was 53 and had a second home in the Napa Valley.         The cause was ovarian cancer, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.         Ms. Tropp, a former Princeton student of Chinese and Chinese culture,  became a leading chef of the new American cuisine who liked to combine French and Chinese culinary concepts.         She delighted in serving the unexpected at her celebrated San Francisco restaurant, China Moon. For example, in 1988, when Asian influence on American cooking was felt most strongly on the West Coast but was spreading throughout the nation, Ms. Tropp served a Chinese pizzette, using Chinese scallion bread as the base. Atop the bread she placed coriander-flavored pork sausage and stir-fried wild mushrooms.         She wrote and taught about cooking as well as serving as chef at the restaurant for a decade. She sold it in 1996 because of poor health.         Her ''China Moon Cookbook'' (1992, Workman) was one of the first books that successfully brought together Chinese and European-American mainstream cooking.         The book won an award from the International Association of Culinary Professionals.         Ms. Tropp's other book was ''The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking: Techniques and Recipes'' (1982, Morrow).         Ms. Tropp grew up in Springfield, N.J., and became interested in China in high school. She graduated from Barnard College and received a master's degree in Chinese literature and art from Princeton. Then she learned about Chinese cooking as a student of poetic structure at the National University in Taiwan.         There ''classic Chinese with refined taste taught me how to eat and how to live,'' she told Craig Claiborne of The New York Times in a 1981 interview. She returned to the United States to work toward a Princeton doctorate in Chinese poetry and, she recalled, ''I had to learn to cook the food I had gotten used to eating in Taiwan.'' So she did.         Mr. Claiborne wrote that she ''speaks and writes fluent Mandarin, and this has given her a fine grasp of the meaning of Chinese cooking and menu terms.'' He said he had asked her why one of her dishes was ''called strange flavor eggplant, and she explained that it came from the word, 'guai,' which in Chinese poetry and art criticism can mean odd or weird.''         Last month she received the President's Award of the organization Women Chefs and Restaurateurs, of which she had been a founder.         Surviving are her husband, Bart Rhoades; two stepsons, Andrew and Matthew Rhoades; a stepdaughter, Elizabeth Rhoades; and a sister,  Nhumey Tropp.       
         Patricia A. Locke, who worked for decades to preserve American Indian languages and became a pioneer in an effort to grant the tribes greater authority in the education of their children, died on Oct. 20 at a hospital in Phoenix. She was 73 and lived in Wakpala, S.D., on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Winona Flying Earth.         Ms. Locke, of Lakota and Chippewa heritage, won a MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 1991 for her work to save tribal languages that were growing extinct throughout the United States.         The award followed more than two decades of her advocacy for better education of Indians. In the 1970's, she was appointed to the Interior Department Task Force on Indian Education Policy, and eventually helped write legislation granting tribes the authority to set up their own education departments instead of following state requirements.         Education departments and tribal education codes were ultimately created among more than 30 tribes around the country, and Ms. Locke also helped 17 tribes establish colleges they controlled.         Patricia Ann McGillis was born on Jan. 21, 1928, on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation in Idaho. She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1951. She married Charles E. Locke in 1952; they divorced in 1975.         Ms. Locke taught for more than 40 years, from elementary to university level, and lectured on Indian issues throughout the United States. She worked to protect sacred Indian sites and, starting in 1993, was national coordinator of a coalition that pushed for passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act Amendments, federal legislation adopted in 1994 that allowed use of peyote for religious purposes.         Ms. Locke's Indian name was Tawacin Waste Win, which, her daughter said, means ''she has good consciousness -- compassionate woman.''         Besides her daughter, who lives in Wakpala, she is survived by a son, Kevin Locke, also of Wakpala, a performing artist who works to preserve Lakota music; five grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.       
         Rosemary Brown, who as a middle-aged widow living in a London suburb in the 1960's said she had been in contact with history's most illustrious composers, offering as evidence hundreds of piano miniatures that she said Beethoven, Bach and others had ''dictated'' to her, died on Nov. 16 in London. She was 85.         The odd experiences she described -- which included shopping with Liszt (he was interested in the price of bananas) and watching television with Chopin (he was appalled) -- found a resonant audience in the era of the Beatles and flower power. More intriguingly, they attracted expert scrutiny and some approbation from such luminaries as Leonard Bernstein, along with tidal waves of more or less good-natured ridicule from most of the music establishment.         Mrs. Brown's credibility as a medium was buttressed by her own musical ignorance. She had just three years of piano instruction and could not play by ear or extemporize. There was no record player or radio in her home and she said she never went to concerts.         ''I seemed to lose control of my hands; it was as though someone were guiding them,'' she said of the first time she received a piece of music from Liszt.         Peter Katin, an outstanding interpreter of Chopin, was pleased to record many of the piano works, while the composer Humphrey Searle published an essay noting the similarity of Mrs. Brown's Liszt pieces with his later official compositions. Mr. Bernstein suggested he could ''buy,'' meaning accept, a piece by Rachmaninoff, but not much else.         André Previn, then conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, said that if the newfound compositions were genuine, they would best have been left on the shelf.         But the British composer Richard Rodney Bennett seemed entirely convinced, at least at the time. He said that when he was having trouble with a composition of his own, Mrs. Brown passed along Debussy's recommendation. It worked.         ''If she is a fake, she is a brilliant one, and must have had years of training,'' he said in an interview in Time magazine. ''Some of the music is awful, but some is marvelous. I couldn't have faked the Beethoven.''         Regardless of how much Western music may or may not have been enriched by posthumous contributions channeled by Mrs. Brown, there was scant doubt of her entertainment value. She set off waves of interest in several appearances on British Broadcasting Corporation radio shows, the first in 1969. In the United States, she played at Town Hall in New York and appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson, telling him that her sources said there was no sex in heaven.         She described the various composers in often humorous detail. Beethoven, she said, was no longer deaf and had lost ''that crabby look.'' Debussy wore ''very bizarre clothes'' and was ''a hippie type.'' Chopin kept screaming something in French; it turned out to be a warning that her bathtub was overflowing.         Later she enjoyed visits from the ghosts of other celebrated people, including Shakespeare, Van Gogh and St. Paul. All the visits, she contended, were intended only to prove the existence of an afterlife.         Rosemary Dickeson was born on July 27, 1916, in southwest London. Her father was an electrician and her mother a catering manager. The family's apartment was above a dance hall, and she won dance contests as a girl. But her father vetoed a dancing career.         The most significant event of her youth occurred when she was 7. She had a vision of an elderly man with long white hair, wearing a black gown. He said he was Liszt. ''He told me that when I grow up, he would give me music,'' she said.         ''I've always had the ability, ever since I can remember, to see and hear people who are thought of as dead,'' she said in an interview with Newsweek.         In 1943, she contracted polio, which left her left side weak. When she was 15, she took a job as a clerk at the post office. When walking home from work one day, she said a voice told her to take a different route. A bombing raid struck her usual route.         In 1948, she got an upright piano and took lessons for the third time; as always, they lasted about a year.         In 1952, she married Charles Brown, a government scientist who had once worked as a gardener for King Farouk of Egypt. In 1961, her husband and her mother died. She began visiting spiritualists active in the emerging New Age thinking.         In 1964, she suffered an accident at the school kitchen where she worked and resumed playing the piano during her long recovery. That was when Liszt returned, as promised. She recognized him immediately, she said, and he arranged for the other composers to come, acting ''like sort of a reception desk.''         They took different approaches. Chopin told her what notes to play and pushed her fingers down on the right keys. Beethoven and Bach liked her to sit at a table and take dictation with a pencil. Schubert tried to sing his compositions, but ''he hasn't a very good voice,'' she said.         She was supported by contributions from people who believed in the occult. She wrote three books on her channeling, and made a number of recordings, some featuring her playing the easier pieces, the last in 1988. In the mid-1980's, the visits ceased as she fell into ill health. She is survived by a son and a daughter.         She always declined to ask her musical visitors the questions that outsiders thought would prove their existence. When Time offered her a list of 20 questions, she replied, ''I cannot push a button and call on the composers just like that.''         But when she needed notes for an album cover in 1970, Sir Donald Tovey, a musicologist, was pleased to provide them. ''It is the implications relevant to this phenomenon that we hope will stimulate sensitive interest,'' he said.         He had died in 1940.       
         Catherine Voorsanger, an associate curator of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Monday in New York City. She was 51 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of melanoma, said her family.         Ms. Voorsanger worked at the Met since 1983, contributing actively to the increasingly visible field of post-Federal American decorative arts. Her main area of concentration was 19th- and early-20th century American furniture, but she arrived there after studying American 19th-century painting and architecture and, at the Met, conducting extensive research on John LaFarge's stained glass and the American Aesthetic Movement. These subjects seemed to make her unusually well equipped to help shatter the prevailing stereotype of 19th-century American furniture as uniformly dark, heavy and ornate, not only in her curatorial work but also in scholarly writing, lecturing and postgraduate teaching.         A prime example of her work was ''Herter Brothers: Furniture and Interiors for a Gilded Age,'' an exhibition organized in 1994 with Alice Cooney Freilinghuysen of the Met's decorative arts department, and Katherine S. Howe of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. She also oversaw research, helped select the objects and contributed to the catalogs for ''In Pursuit of Beauty: Americans and the Aesthetic Movement'' (1987) and ''American Paradise: The World of the Hudson River School'' (1988). Her 88-page ''Dictionary of Architects, Artisans, Artists and Manufacturers'' in the ''Aesthetic Movement'' catalog has become a standard reference in the field.         With John K. Howat, former chairman of the department of decorative arts at the Met, Ms. Voorsanger organized last year's ''Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861,'' which traced the beginning of New York's ascendancy as a cultural capital. The exhibition's catalog won the New-York Historical Society's Henry Allen Moe Award for art-historical writing, and was also the first exhibition catalog to make the New York Public Library's annual Books to Remember list of 25 outstanding publications.         At the Met she also coordinated the updating and computerizing of the documentation for the thousands of decorative objects in the Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American Art, a vast open-storage display that opened in 1989, and organized the 1994 exhibition ''The Decorative Arts of Frank Lloyd Wright in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.''         Ms. Voorsanger was born Catherine Hoover in Oakland, Calif., in 1950. She earned a B.A. in art history from Smith College in 1972, and, later, a master's and a doctorate from the City University of New York. From 1972 to 1979 she worked as assistant curator and then curator at the California Historical Society in San Francisco. During this time she was a protégé of Alfred Frankenstein, a well-known San Francisco art critic.         In 1979 she returned to New York to become a senior researcher for the painting collection of New York City, initiating a site review and conservation inspection of some 300 19th-century works in public buildings throughout the five boroughs.         Ms. Voorsanger is survived by her husband, Bartholomew Voorsanger, an architect who designed the renovation of the Asia Society and the expansion of the Morgan Library; her mother, Beatrice Slater, of San Rafael, Calif.; and her sister, Holly de Montmarin, of Paris.         Correction:  December 29, 2001, Saturday  A obituary on Dec. 14 about Catherine Voorsanger, an associate curator of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, omitted several survivors. They are her father, Robert C. Hoover of Piedmont, Calif.; her brother Robert C. Hoover II of Alameda, Calif.; her half-sister, Whitney Hoover of Piedmont, Calif.; and her half-brothers, John S. Hoover of Los Angeles and Samuel S. Slater of Ketchum, Idaho.       
         LAST week, as the fiercely partisan legislators of the virtually bankrupt Nassau County turned blue in the face during an all-night fight over their 2002 budget, the inner schoolmarm, dormant since she left teaching for politics, emerged in the presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs. The county was just a few days and decimal points from a budget takeover by a state-appointed board, and instead of finding a solution to a $45 million deficit, from her vantage point, its legislators were behaving like kindergartners.         So she indulged in a momentary power trip, something she says she avoided in two years of playing peacemaker among 18 colleagues. Tired of banging her gavel and yelling for order in her court, she pressed an index finger to the mute button, effectively smothering every microphone in the room. The silence was shocking, and restorative: they reverted to adults.         Around 4:30 a.m., the exhausted legislators crept home after a budget was approved for perusal by the not-quite-lame-duck county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, who yesterday vetoed parts of it and cut a proposed property tax increase to 9 percent from the 15 percent that Ms. Jacobs and her fellow Democrats had supported. The budget now goes to the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the state chaperon, which has the power to take over the county's finances if it does not accept the budget. Though she admits to being ''on pins and needles,'' on that overlong evening Ms. Jacobs, a loquacious 62-year-old Democrat, was the only one to go home chuckling. Pushing the panic button was more fun than expected.         ''I don't like to use it,'' she says of the magical mute. ''I don't look at myself as Judge Judy, but I'll tell you the truth, I've learned to stop the nonsensible rhetoric when it gets really destructive. And that night it was out of control.''         She's still chuckling about it, her plump frame nestled into a brown leather couch in the den of the Woodbury split-level she says she has seen very little of in the past two years of budget crises. She loves her $67,000-a-year job, spending 10 or 11 hours a day at the office or out among the public that awarded her a third term and 80 percent of the vote as the representative for the county's Legislative District 16. This pit stop on the home front is such a rarity that she even had to reintroduce herself to the U.P.S. deliveryman who showed up with a package to add to the pile of wrapped Hanukkah presents (she has four grandchildren) in the dining room. ''He was shocked to see me here in broad daylight,'' she said.         Her silver Lexus with the vanity plates 1 JUJU rests in the driveway after a morning trip to the Woodbury Jewish Center to explain the proposed 15 percent tax increase to 150 elderly residents; she thinks she won them over by being honest. Her kitchen is Martha Stewart spotless, and why not? She confesses that it's hardly used. That enticing vanilla cake on the pedestal, the limes and lemons in clear canisters, the bowl of vegetables: all fakes. ''I never baked a cake that looked that good back when I actually cooked.''         But she is quite proficient with budget ingredients. According to her, without the 15 percent tax increase, Nassau, the black sheep of the state's counties for receiving a $45 million bailout to protect its bonds from junk bond status (''Embarrassing!''), won't have a workable 2002 budget. That's what she warned her morning audience. ''The response I got was, 'Just fix it already!' ''         But the Republicans continue to holler for cuts, and Ms. Jacobs, her color deepening beneath her pale perm, her manner revealing how she earned the reputation as ''the lady with the hammer'' back in her civic activist decades, insists that cuts are not a cure.         ''They have not been participants, they've been obstructionists,'' she says of the Republicans, then quotes a letter from the minority leader, Peter Schmitt, in response to her request to specify cuts. ''He said, 'My grandmother always used to say, if you have weeds in your garden, don't point to weeds in mine.' Now that is not an answer. Rhetoric is so cheap but so unrealistic at a time of distress like this,'' she adds. She says that if Democrats had had the stranglehold on Nassau County, she probably would have been a Republican; she's contrarian that way.         MS. JACOBS, who moved from Queens to Woodbury with her husband, Sid, in 1967, was politicized by a classic case of ''not in my backyard'': she awakened to the rumble of bulldozers ripping apart cornfields to make space for a decidedly unbucolic Geico insurance building. She and her neighbors protested, babes in arms, and were hauled off to the town offices for a talking-to by the police chief. ''We were the original Mad Mothers of Woodbury,'' she says. Next came her days of RAGE, an acronym for Residents Against Garbage Expansion.         She ran unsuccessfully for the Oyster Bay Town Board in 1977, but when the County Board of Supervisors was replaced by the County Legislature in 1995, she won a seat, a powerless seat. ''In 1996 there were six Democrats out of 19 legislators; if we'd all left for California for five years, nobody would have cared,'' she says. In 1999, the Democrats gained a majority and Ms. Jacobs became presiding officer, a position she hopes to retain despite backing a friend, Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, in the primary against Thomas R. Suozzi, the incoming county executive. That decision is expected this weekend, and Ms. Jacobs is not sweating it.         ''I don't mean to be corny,'' she says, ''but I like to believe you are what you've been.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Faith Hubley, a three-time Academy Award winner whose 50 animated films often combined elements of myth, jazz and a deeply felt humanism, died on Friday in New Haven. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         For more than 45 years Ms. Hubley made a film a year, an achievement that Dan McLaughlin, head of the animation workshop at the University of California at Los Angeles, called unbelievable. Her first 21 films were made in partnership with her husband, John, before his death in 1977. Her newest film, ''Northern Ice, Golden Sun,'' came out of the lab just a few days ago; its premiere is to be tomorrow at U.C.L.A., and it is to be shown Jan. 8 at the Museum of Modern Art as part of a celebration of Ms. Hubley's life.         Exploring what she called mythic landscapes, Ms. Hubley used primitive myths, magic and music and, in three classic films, the recorded voices of her four young children to comment on the world as it was, is and should be. A jazz fan who sometimes played the cello in her films, she used the works of Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Carter and Quincy Jones as background for what has been described as ''filmic poetry.'' Although the visual images of her later films evoke Miró and Klee, Ms. Hubley has described her films as close to cave painting. ''Northern Ice, Golden Sun,'' not quite seven minutes long, paints the deep attachment the Inuit feel toward the earth.         Ms. Hubley once said that the central thread that runs through her impressionistic, dreamlike and often whimsical films is ''human development, with a strong emphasis on the importance of children as people and on the environment people live in.''         When Faith and John Hubley married in 1955 and began making films together, they had only two marriage vows, according to Ms. Hubley. ''One was to eat with the children,'' she said. ''The other was to make one independent film a year.''         The Hubleys kept both promises, and filmmaking became a family affair. They won their first Academy Award in 1959 for ''Moonbird,'' an impressionistic account of young children at play whose unique soundtrack was the recorded voices of their two sons, Mark and Ray. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would not change the name of the category in which they won from ''cartoons'' to ''animated films'' until 1971, but the Hubleys were already expanding cartoons beyond Disney.         Their second Oscar came in 1962, for ''The Hole,'' in which two construction workers debated nuclear destruction. Their third, in 1966, was for the buoyant ''Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature,'' in which the band plays on as more and more people crowd into its automobile.         The Hubleys' work was the subject of a retrospective in 1998 at the Museum of Modern Art.         Until John Hubley's death during heart surgery, Ms. Hubley was considered the lesser partner in their work. When they met, he was already well known. At Disney he had worked as an art director on ''Bambi,'' ''Dumbo,'' ''Pinocchio,'' and ''The Rite of Spring'' episode of ''Fantasia.'' Staunchly pro-union, he had left Disney during a bitter strike in 1941 and then was a founder of United Productions of America, where he helped move animation away from Disney with the creation of ''Mr. Magoo'' and ''Gerald McBoing-Boing.''         Ms. Hubley, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, had bolted from home at the age of 15 without finishing high school. Reticent in interviews about her childhood except to say that her parents had ''made no room for children,'' she created an intimate self-portrait on film in the 25-minute ''My Universe Inside Out'' (1996), which hints at child abuse and her parents' burning down the family house.         At 18, Ms. Hubley went to Hollywood. Because World War II had emptied the studios of young men, she got a job as a messenger at Columbia. She worked her way up to sound-effects editor, music editor and script clerk, and dreamed of being an independent filmmaker.         History gave her a shove in the right direction. Because of John Hubley's political activism, they were blacklisted. Returning to New York, they fed their growing family by working on commercials and educational films. Their first independent film, ''Adventures of an *,'' was finished the year after their marriage, right on schedule.         ''We could have been rich,'' Ms. Hubley recently told a reporter. ''But I told John, 'If you're an artist, you can't be a huckster.' ''         The Hubleys earned an Oscar nomination for ''Windy Day'' in 1968. This time the voices of the children were those of their two daughters, Emily and Georgia. In ''Cockaboody'' (1973), Emily and Georgia played at being grown-up mothers and glancingly mulled the death of their own mother.         When John died, the Hubleys were working on their 21st film, ''The Doonesbury Special.'' Finished by Ms. Hubley, Garry Trudeau and their longtime animator, Bill Littlejohn, the film became their seventh to be nominated for an Oscar.         After her husband's death, Ms. Hubley turned to larger themes and more abstract images. ''Step by Step'' (1979) projects mother love against the impossibility of protecting children in a world of foul water and limited food. ''Seers and Clowns'' (1994), which was animated by Ms. Hubley, both her daughters and Mr. Littlejohn, uses the words of Chief Seattle against metamorphosing images of wisdom and folly.         ''Faith was always timid about doing animation,'' said Mr. Littlejohn, who first worked with Ms. Hubley on the 1962 film ''The Hole.'' ''The strengths of her films were her brilliant designs and her strong ideas. And making one film a year is a standard no one else has approached.''         Ms. Hubley's solo films, usually a combination of her watercolor paintings and cel animation, often dealt in a poetic way with the treatment of women (''Witch Madness,'' 1999) and with pre-Christian myths. ''The Big Bang and Other Creation Myths'' gives no more credence to the scientific explanation of the beginning of the world than it does to half a dozen primitive beliefs.         At the time of her death, Ms. Hubley was a senior critic in the department of art at Yale University. In addition to her four children, she is survived by six grandchildren.         To the end, Ms. Hubley loved being an independent filmmaker. As she told an interviewer a few months ago: ''I am willing to pay the price: total financial anxiety all the time. I don't have any greed illusions. I need to eat, and that's that.''
