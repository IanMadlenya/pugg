         Marilyn Costello, the principal harpist of the Philadelphia Orchestra for 46 years and a respected teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music, died on Jan. 5 at her home in Philadelphia. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, said Ann Diebold, a spokeswoman for the Curtis Institute.         Ms. Costello was born in Cleveland and began her musical studies as a pianist. She made her public debut in a concert at the Cleveland Museum of Art when she was 6, and won prizes in several competitions while a teen-ager. She decided to study the harp when she was 14, after running her hands across the instrument's strings backstage at a concert of the Cleveland Orchestra.         Her principal studies were with Carlos Salzedo, the composer and harpist, at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, and it was during her second year as a student there, in 1945, that Eugene Ormandy, the conductor, invited her to join the Philadelphia Orchestra. She was the orchestra's second harpist for about half a season, and was appointed principal harpist in 1946, a position she held until her retirement in 1992.         Ms. Costello joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute in 1962, and taught harpists who eventually took positions in many of the world's great orchestras, including the Berlin Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony and the National Symphony.         She is survived by her husband, L. Daniel Dannenbaum; a son, Daniel George Dannenbaum, and two stepdaughters, Marianne Kierstead of Merrimack, N.H., and Alison Lang of Lillooet, British Columbia.       
         Hilda Morley, an American poet who gained wider recognition late in life, decades after she first published her imagist free verse, died on Monday at Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead, London. A former resident of Sag Harbor, N.Y., she was 81 and had moved to London last year to continue work on a biography of her late husband, the avant-garde composer Stefan Wolpe.         The cause was liver failure after a fall at home, said a spokeswoman for her publisher, Moyer Bell.         Ms. Morley published five books of poetry in which she articulated emotions and feelings in free verse, but a type of verse as measured as dance  or music. She was a ''master of that ability,'' Robert Creeley, a fellow poet, said.         She wrote that her poetry was shaped by the visions of Abstract Expressionism, which can create metamorphoses. Artists like Klee and Picasso, she said, gave her the means to create word canvases depicting the world around her.         Born Hilda Auerbach in Manhattan, Ms. Morley considered herself an inhabitant of the world. She was educated in New York, Haifa (in what was then known as Palestine), London and at Wellesley College, Ohio State University and New York University.         Along the way she taught English at a private school in England and at Walden School in New York, where she also worked as a researcher for the Zionist Youth Commission and as a Hebrew translator for the Office of War Information.         Starting in the 1940's, she intermittently lectured at Rutgers University. After her marriage in 1952, she taught English literature at Black Mountain College in North Carolina. Once recognized as a poet, she took academic assignments, lecturing, leading poetry workshops and judging poetry. She was a resident poet at Northeast Missouri University in 1992.         Ms. Morley is survived by a stepdaughter, Katherina Wolpe of London.         The first collection of her previously published poetry was ''A Blessing Outside Us'' (1976). It was followed by three others that remain in print: ''What Are Winds and What Are Waters'' (1993), ''To Hold in My Hand: Selected Poems, 1953-83'' (1984) and ''Cloudless at First'' (1988).         Her final collection was ''The Turning,'' which has just been published. It includes ''Fiesta, Ibiza,'' her evocation of a place she savored:         Warm crystal         of my little         city;         the fishes         swim over the bay,         rooftops swooping         with light,         the wreaths & garlands         bursting gently         in night's element,         the sunlit branches         exploding         softly,         the sea baring         its lights         burning         the unshadowed joys       
         Linda Eastman McCartney, the wife of the former Beatle Paul McCartney and a photographer whose portraits of 1960's rock stars have become classics, died on Friday in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the McCartneys were vacationing. She was 56.         The cause was breast cancer that spread to her liver, said Geoff Baker, a family spokesman.         Besides her work as a photographer, Ms. McCartney performed as a keyboardist and backup singer in two of her husband's post-Beatles bands, Wings and the unnamed ensemble that toured in 1989 and 1993. She was a staunch campaigner for animal rights and vegetarianism and, starting in the late 1980's, she turned her passion for vegetarian cooking into an industry. She published two cookbooks, ''Linda McCartney's Home Cooking'' in 1989 and ''Linda's Kitchen'' in 1996, and in 1991 started a line of frozen vegetarian dinners.         As the wife of a musician who had long been a teen-age heartthrob and was the last Beatle to be married,  Ms. McCartney first attracted the ire of her husband's fans, and eventually the respect of many of them. When the McCartneys were married in London on March 12, 1969, hundreds of crying girls packed the sidewalk outside the Marylebone Register Office. Later, when she toured with Mr. McCartney, she took considerable criticism for her modest keyboard and vocal technique.         But the McCartneys' 29-year marriage was uncommonly steady by the standards of the celebrity world of which they were a part but from which they generally remained aloof, spending most of their time on a farm in West Sussex, England. They  never spent a night apart, except for the 10 days Mr. McCartney spent in a Tokyo jail after he was arrested for marijuana possession; indeed, their disinclination to be separated was part of Mr. McCartney's reason for having his wife in his touring band.         And Mr. McCartney, the composer of some of the rock era's most beautiful love songs, has consistently told interviewers that all his romantic  ballads written after 1968 were about Linda. Those songs include everything from ''Maybe I'm Amazed'' and ''The Lovely Linda'' on his first post-Beatles album, ''McCartney'' (1970), ''Long-Haired Lady'' on ''Ram'' (1971) and ''My Love'' on ''Red Rose Speedway'' (1973) to more recent songs like ''We Got Married'' and ''Figure of Eight'' on ''Flowers in the Dirt'' (1989) and ''Somedays'' on ''Flaming Pie'' (1997), his most recent studio album.         Mr. McCartney was not the first to compose a song about Ms. McCartney. Her father, Lee Eastman, was a prominent show business lawyer in New York and one of his clients, Jack Lawrence, wrote ''Linda'' for her in 1947 when she was 6. Buddy Clark had a hit with the song that year, and it was later recorded by Perry Como and Jan and Dean.         Ms. McCartney also wrote a few songs, including the reggae-style ''Seaside Woman,'' which she and Mr. McCartney released as a single in 1977 under the name Suzy and the Red Stripes, and ''The White-Coated Man,'' which she wrote with Carla Lane and released (also as Suzy and the Red Stripes) on an animal-rights charity disk, ''Animal Magnetism,'' in 1994.         She was born Linda Louise Eastman on September 24, 1941, and grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. As she often pointed out, without ever dispelling the assertion entirely, she was not related to the Eastmans of the Eastman-Kodak photography empire. In fact, her father had changed his name from Epstein.         She described growing up in artistic and materialistic surroundings, with a status-conscious mother and a father whose friends and clients included the artist Willem de Kooning and the songwriters Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Arlen.         Ms. McCartney attended Sarah Lawrence College and the University of Arizona. While a student in Arizona, she married and had a daughter, but the marriage ended in 1963.         Soon afterward, she took up photography, and in 1965 she returned to New York, where she began photographing rock groups, starting with the Dave Clark Five and the Rolling Stones. During the next few years she befriended and photographed dozens of rock stars, including Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, the Animals, Janis Joplin, the Mamas and the Papas, Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa, the Beach Boys and the Grateful Dead. A widely reproduced picture of the Beatles that she took at a press party for the release of ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' in 1967 captured the group on the eve of its greatest artistic triumph.         Her photographs appeared in Rolling Stone and other rock magazines, and in 1992 she published several hundred of them as a book, ''Linda McCartney's Sixties: Portrait of an Era.''         Ms. McCartney met her future husband while photographing the Beatles in London in 1967, and the pair carried on an occasional romance for more than a year. In September 1968, Mr. McCartney asked her to move to London, from which point they became inseparable. Although she took some stunning pictures of the Beatles at work, she left most of them unpublished until she assembled her ''Sixties'' book. Her photographs of Mr. McCartney, however, adorned some of his post-Beatles album covers, and in one of his early television specials, ''James Paul McCartney,'' he is shown singing a medley of his songs while his wife did a photo shoot.         In addition to Mr. McCartney and the daughter from her first marriage, Heather, Ms. McCartney is survived by three children from her marriage with Mr. McCartney: Mary, Stella and James; and by her brother John, who is now Mr. McCartney's lawyer and business manager, and two sisters, Laura and Louise.         Besides ''Sixties,'' Ms. McCartney published several other books, including ''Linda's Pictures,'' ''Sun Prints,'' ''Photographs'' and ''Road Works.'' Celebrities were by no means her only photographic subject. Plants, animals, natural patterns on rock faces and people she encountered on her travels engaged her interest and were captured with a touching refinement in many of her pictures. Her work has also been the subject of exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Royal Photographic Society in Bath, England, and at more than 50 galleries around the world.         Correction:  April 21, 1998, Tuesday  The obituary of the photographer Linda McCartney yesterday gave an incorrect name in some copies for the most recent studio album by her husband, the former Beatle Paul McCartney. It is ''Flaming Pie''; ''Off the Ground'' was the one before that.         Correction:  June 11, 1998, Thursday  The obituary of Linda McCartney on April 20 misstated her college background. She attended only the University of Arizona, not Sarah Lawrence College as well. The obituary also misstated the given name of her first husband in some copies. He was Melvin See, not Bob. The errors were pointed out in E-mail received from a reader yesterday.       
         Clara Rockmore, a musician who was trained as a violinist but became famous principally as a soloist on the theremin, an early electronic instrument, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         The theremin, invented in 1920 by Leon Theremin, produces a pure, eerie, sliding tone that has been compared to a disembodied, wordless soprano voice or an enchanted cello. In recent years, thanks in part to the 1994 film ''Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey,'' the instrument has developed a cult following, as has Ms. Rockmore, who appeared in the movie. She was also the focus of a video documentary, ''Clara Rockmore, the Greatest Theremin Virtuosa,'' released last month.         Describing Ms. Rockmore's performances, Steve Martin, the director of the theremin film, said, ''Clara is to the theremin what Andres Segovia and Jimi Hendrix combined are to the guitar.''         Ms. Rockmore was born Clara Reisenberg in Vilna (now Vilnius) in Lithuania. She showed considerable talent as a violinist before she was 4, and in 1915 she became the youngest musician ever admitted to the St. Petersburg Conservatory. Her principal teacher there was Leopold Auer, whose other students had included Mischa Elman and Jascha Heifetz.         In the mid-1920's, Ms. Rockmore moved to New York, where she resumed her studies with Auer, who had also immigrated. After a few years, however, she began to have muscular and joint problems that curtailed her career as a violinist. At around the same time, she met Theremin and decided to study his electronic instrument. She became his student and close friend; for her 18th birthday, he made her a cake that lit up and revolved whenever anyone approached. Ms. Rockmore's influence on the instrument itself included suggesting structural changes to improve its articulation.         Ms. Rockmore gave one of the first theremin concerts in the United States, in 1934. The composer Anis Fuleihan wrote a concerto for her, and she performed as a soloist with several orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Toronto Symphony.         Ms. Rockmore is survived by a sister, Anna Sherman of Manhattan.       
         Betty Carter, one of jazz's great singers and a composer and arranger whose groups were virtual schools for generations of jazz musicians, died at home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn on Saturday. She was 69.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her friend Ora Harris.         Ms. Carter sounded like no one in jazz, with her own diction, her own phrasing and her own sense of pitch. Though she was firmly inside the jazz-singing tradition, she was an abstractionist as well, and for her words were pliable. On her early material -- she began a solo recording career in the mid-1950's -- her light, pure voice sounded instrumental, with curved, beautifully shaped notes. It was immediately noticeable that she was after something different, and that her technique, always extraordinary, was there to work for her ideas. It was equally clear that she was a jazz musician first and a singer second.         About a decade after beginning her recording career, Ms. Carter refined her originality into a style that became the template for modern jazz singing. On ''Look No Further,'' recorded in 1964, Ms. Carter uses her voice against the bass, then as the band comes in her note choice mirrors the experimentation of instrumentalists like John Coltrane and Miles Davis; during the same session she recorded ''My Favorite Things,'' a composition associated with Mr. Coltrane. Her improvisations were explosive, tumbling out in great leaps at a velocity that expressed unfettered artistic freedom.         But it was artifice. Ms. Carter was one of jazz's most articulate small-group arrangers, and few musicians have ever controlled tempo the way  she had; woe to the young musicians in the band who could not navigate the shockingly abrupt tempo changes or keep up with Ms. Carter's fastest or slowest tempos. Her snapping fingers, marking off the time, sent generations of musicians back to the practice room, chagrined.         In her hands a standard or her own compositions often contrasted some of jazz's slowest tempos with some of its fastest. She wasn't afraid to pare down the instrumentation of a group for a while, singing against piano or bass, orchestrating the arrival of other instruments. And the constant tempo-changing gave the impression of emotional extremity and careful control of the artistic environment. She sculptured sound, and it made her concerts some of the most moving experiences in jazz, a mixture of the emotional power of the songs' texts and the sheer joy of her imagination.         ''I started to change my material to keep the musicians interested,'' Ms. Carter said in a 1992 interview with The New York Times. ''What do you do with a chorus and a half? You change things, stretch them out, change speed. Most musicians I played with were so good they could do what was necessary.''         Ms. Carter grew up in Detroit, which in the 1940's and 1950's was a good environment for jazz musicians, with the city producing some of the best musicians of the time.         Detroit was a stop on the jazz circuit, and a young Ms. Carter sang with Charlie Parker, who came through town. One of her nicknames was Betty Bebop, a tribute to her interests. In 1948 she began working with Lionel Hampton and his band, staying with the vibraphonist until 1951, when, during a performance in New York, she decided to remain there. During the same time she recorded the female part for King Pleasure's version of ''Red Top,'' singing a vocal rendition of Gail Brockman's original trumpet solo.         In New York in 1955 and '56, Ms. Carter began recording for Epic Records and generally taking in the  city. In 1957, she recorded with Wynton Kelly and other peers; her work was irregular partly because her style was more jazz than cabaret, and partly because she tried to avoid  the abusive working situations that have plagued jazz.         In 1961 Ms. Carter recorded what has become a classic album, ''Ray Charles and Betty Carter,'' with Mr. Charles; it features the pair singing astringent duets including a famous version of ''Baby, It's Cold Outside.'' Ms. Carter worked with Mr. Charles from 1960 to 1963, the year she toured Japan with Sonny Rollins and recorded an orchestral album for Atco Records.         Through the 1960's Ms. Carter struggled with her career, recording with Roulette Records in the late 1960's, during which the avant-garde and pop music rendered some artists identified with an older style commercially irrelevant. But in 1969 she started her own recording company, Bet-Car Productions, and on that label she released her albums.         In 1988 Ms. Carter began a relationship with Verve Records that included the reissue of the Bet-Car label along with the recording of a series of new albums. That same year she released ''Look What I Got!,'' which won a Grammy, and in 1994 she recorded an album, ''Feed the Fire,'' with the pianist Geri Allen, the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette.         Also during the 1980's Ms. Carter, finally recognized for her innovations, became a concert draw internationally. She recorded duets with Carmen McRae, and she kept turning out well-rounded musicians, having trained them in her trio. Included in the alumni from the 1980's and the 1990's were the pianists Cyrus Chestnut, Benny Green, Stephen Scott, Marc Cary, Darrell Grant and Travis Shook. And her choice of drummers was extraordinary, having hired Greg Hutchinson, Clarence Penn, Winard Harper, Troy Davis and Lewis Nash. She began receiving numerous awards, including the National Medal of Arts given last year by President Clinton.         In 1993 she began the Jazz Ahead series at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a program that featured young and promising musicians.  This year the Jazz Ahead series was invited to appear at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.         Ms. Carter is survived by two sons, Myles and Kagle Redding, both of New York City. A marriage to James Redding ended in divorce.         ''The survival of jazz culture takes priority,'' Ms. Carter said in the interview with The Times. ''The survival of this culture depends on people playing it and living the life. The young guys playing it in 20 years will be taking the music somewhere else. There was a period where, in jazz, the music sent people away. But it's now back to making people feel better, putting happy smiles on their faces. When I was coming up, that's what jazz was about. It wasn't about money. It was about how happy you could make people.''       
         Nancy Topf, a choreographer, dancer and teacher, died last Wednesday in the crash of Swissair Flight 111 off Nova Scotia. She was 55 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Topf performed with many choreographers in the post-modernist and more traditional new modern-dance scene in New York City during the 1960's, among them Art Bauman, Elizabeth Keen, Katherine Litz and Deborah Hay. She began a  career as an independent choreographer and performer in 1969, becoming known for minimalist dance that was highly physical with an implicit emotional quality and that often incorporated geometric patterns.         Reviewing Ms. Topf's ''Garden Gate'' in 1991 in The New York Times, Jack Anderson wrote of unhurried, rooted movement that embodied architectural characteristics of the performance space. ''Reaching and swinging motions'' of the arms, Mr. Anderson wrote, suggested the dancers had ''grown wings, an illusion that invested 'The Garden Gate' with the strange exhilaration of a dream of flying.''         In 1974, Ms. Topf appeared in the first formal showing of contact improvisation, an influential form of fluid physical improvisation based in the gaining and losing of balance. She developed a technique of neuromuscular retraining, which involved a repatterning and realignment of the body that many dancers found helpful for healing chronic injuries and focusing on their creative work. Ms. Topf had a private practice in New York and was also an internationally known teacher. When she died she  was flying to Geneva to teach.         A graduate of the University of Wisconsin, Ms. Topf received her primary training from Merce Cunningham and Barbara Clark but also studied with Robert Joffrey, Anna Halprin, Steve Paxton and the H. B. Studio. She also wrote about contact improvisation and reviewed dance for publications including Dance Magazine, The New York Times and The Village Voice.         Ms. Topf is survived by her husband, Jon Gibson, a composer with whom she often collaborated, and a son, Jeremy, both of Manhattan; her mother, Celia Topf Straus of Lauderhill, Fla., and three sisters, Bobbi Straus of Port Washington, N.Y., Peggy Schwartz of Amherst, Mass., and Margie J. Topf of Boston.       
         Pauline Julien, who sang songs of passion and of tender love, died on Wednesday in Montreal. The chanteuse, who was 70, was most strongly identified with the songs she sang in the cause of a separate and independent Quebec.         Ms. Julien took her own life at her home after leaving a note saying she did not want to be revived, said her sister, Fabienne Julien. She said the singer suffered from aphasia, a condition that severely limits the power to use or understand words, and had grown despondent as the disease progressed.         In a singing career that spanned more than 35 years and two continents, Ms. Julien became a beloved figure to French-speaking audiences who were touched by her stirring performances and forceful style. She recorded 22 albums containing more than 200 songs, including about 30 that she composed.         She popularized homespun Quebecois music in France and helped revive the popularity of sophisticated French music in Quebec. She interpreted the music of Kurt Weill and the Quebec composer Gilles Vigneault. One of her most popular songs was called ''Tonight I Feel Tender,'' a ballad that became a theme that she performed at many performances.         But from the time she first returned to Quebec from Paris in the late 1950's she formed part of the inspirational soul of the separatist movement in Quebec. She fell in love with the Quebecois poet and journalist Gerald Godin, a staunch separatist, and fought with him for Quebec separatism.         During a crisis in Quebec in 1970 when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sent the Canadian Army into the streets of Montreal in response to separatist violence, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were among a number of Quebecers who were swept off the streets and briefly jailed.         After Mr. Godin was elected to the province's assembly in 1976, the year the separatist party won control of the provincial government, she appeared regularly at major separatist rallies, leading huge crowds in song and fiery speeches.         She played a major role in fighting for women's rights and in obtaining the right to abortion in predominately Catholic Quebec.         ''Madame Julien lived intensely,'' said Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec. ''Her voice, the words of her songs -- above all on the question of love, friendship and her country -- her charisma and her passionate character are deeply etched in our collective memory.''         Ms. Julien was born in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, in 1928. She studied drama in Paris in the 1950's and  began singing there in bistros and bohemian clubs.         Jean Paul Goay, Ms. Julien's brother-in-law, said that on the night before she died she insisted on being taken to a show in Montreal where an old friend, the French comedian Raymond Davos, was performing. ''She told him then that they would never see each other again, but he didn't understand exactly what it signified,'' Mr. Goay said.         In the early 1990's, after 30 years of a common-law marriage, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were formally married. He died of a brain tumor in 1994.         In her later years Ms. Julien retired from active performing and traveled to Africa to work with the poor in Burkina Faso and other French-speaking countries.         She is survived by two children, Pascale and Nicolas, both of Montreal, from her first marriage to Jacques Galipeau, which ended in divorce.       
         Barbara Thornton, a singer and musicologist who, with Benjamin Bagby, founded and directed Sequentia, the medieval music ensemble, died last Sunday at the Caritas hospice in Cologne, Germany. She was 48 and lived in Cologne.         The cause was complications from a brain tumor, Jon Aaron, her manager, said.         Ms. Thornton, whose soprano voice had a mezzolike hue and a texture that gave it a distinctive character, was a specialist in the music of the 12th-century abbess Hildegard von Bingen, and it was largely because of Ms. Thornton's performances and recordings with Sequentia that Hildegard and her works have lately become the focus of scholarly and popular interest.         In 1982, when Sequentia toured with a production of Hildegard's ''Ordo Virtutum,'' an allegorical work in which the soul is confronted by both the Virtues and the Devil, Hildegard was virtually unknown outside a small circle of musicologists and students of medieval sacred works. Since then, the ensemble has recorded virtually all of Hildegard's extant music for the Deutsche Harmonia Mundi label, including two versions of ''Ordo Virtutum.'' When Sequentia offered its production again last summer, at the Lincoln Center Festival, it was a popular draw, and one of at least three versions of the work presented in New York City this year.         Ms. Thornton was born in Summit, N.J., and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. During a tour with the Sarah Lawrence European Chorus in the early 1970's, she decided to continue her studies in Europe, and coached in the operatic repertory with teachers in Amsterdam, Zurich and Cremona, Italy. Her growing interest in early music led her to Basel, Switzerland, where she enrolled at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, from which she received an advanced diploma in 1977.         She met Mr. Bagby, a singer and medieval harpist, in Basel in 1974, and started Sequentia with him in 1977. Like many early-music ensembles, Sequentia expanded and contracted as the music required, sometimes using solo voices and a single accompanying instrument, sometimes drawing on a men's choir, the Sons of Thunder; a women's choir, Vox Feminae, and medieval harps, strings, flutes and hurdy-gurdy.         Besides its Hildegard series, Sequentia recorded three disks of sacred works from Spanish monasteries -- including the ''Codex las Huelgas'' and works composed for King Alfonso X (''El Sabio'') -- as well as several collections of courtly love songs and a compilation of sacred and secular works by Oswald von Wolkenstein, a knight, poet and composer who straddled the 14th and 15th centuries.         She is survived by Mr. Bagby, her companion; her parents, Fletcher and Margaret Thornton of Exeter, N.H., and two sisters, Susan Frey Starbuck of Seattle and Anne Thornton Bridges of Woodstock, Vt.       
         Her first writings to reach print ran shoulder to shoulder with Ernest Hemingway's. For her first published poetry she was grouped with William Carlos Williams and Marianne Moore. She made it to Paris ahead of both Hemingway and F. Scott Fitzgerald. She was a leader of the University of Chicago school of imagist poets, and if hers is not a household name, by the time she died on Monday at the age of 99 in the house in Los Altos, Calif., she had occupied for two-thirds of a century, Janet Lewis had the satisfaction of knowing she had written poetry throughout the 20th century and seen it published and praised in every decade since the first.         Her reputation has seemingly been eclipsed by that of her late husband, Yvor Winters, the poet, professor and critic who wrestled Hart Crane's ''Bridge'' into print and made Stanford -- and Los Altos -- a magnet for three generations of poets. Yet there are many who will assure you that when the literary history of the second millennium is written at the end of the third, in the category of dazzling American short fiction her ''Wife of Martin Guerre'' will be regarded as the 20th century's ''Billy Budd'' and Janet Lewis will be ranked with Herman Melville. (Though, to be fair, her prose is more often likened to Stendahl's.)         What makes her accomplishments even more impressive is that over the course of a a career in which she wrote hundreds of poems, a single collection of short stories, a couple of children's books, a handful of novels, the words to five operas and one acclaimed masterpiece, Miss Lewis pursued a literary life in which the focus was on the life and the life was one of such placid equilibrium and domestic bliss that she had to reach deep down in her psyche -- and far back in the annals of criminal law -- to find the wellspring of tension that produced some of the 20th century's most vividly imagined and finely wrought literature.         She also had to find the time.         As she once observed, women of prodigious literary output, like Willa Cather and Edith Wharton, tended not to have children. As the mother of two, Miss Lewis willingly put her work aside when her children were young and cheerfully accepted other duties as well. ''It's a question of what you want to do with your life,'' she once said. ''You might also want to take care of your husband.''         The daughter of a poetry-spouting English professor, Miss Lewis was born in Chicago and grew up in Oak Park where she and her 1899 contemporary, Ernest Hemingway, contributed their first works to the same high school literary magazines, she deriving inspiration by summering even deeper in the north woods than he and finding a lifelong fascination with nature and the natural flow of life.         Her sentiments were expressed in a 1922 poetry collection, ''The Indians in the Woods,'' in a series of stories later included in a 1946 collection, ''Good-Bye, Son and Other Stories,'' and in a 1932 narrative, as she called it, ''The Invasion,'' the multi-generational account of a Scotch-Irish-Indian family.         After two years at a junior college, Miss Lewis completed her education at the University of Chicago, majoring in French while joining the famous Poetry Club and meeting Mr. Winters, who had spent time at a tuberculosis sanitarium in Santa Fe, N.M.         After a brief stay in Paris after graduation in 1920, Miss Lewis returned to Chicago but soon contracted tuberculosis herself and spent five years at the same sanitarium, engaging in a passionate correspondence with Mr. Winters and eventually marrying him and following him to California, where she threw herself into a satisfying domestic life that included tending to her husband's registered Airedales, harvesting the fruit from the adjacent orchard and serving as a sort of serene den mother to an extended, animated family of her husband's awed acolytes.         One of the first and by far the fiercest and most controversial of the New Critics and a man of cocksure opinions, for all his fabled influence on 20th century American poetry, Mr. Winters may have made his greatest contribution to literature when his wife, whose life was virtually without drama, complained that she had trouble finding suitable plots and he gave her a chance copy of a 19th-century compilation of famous old legal cases.         By the time she had finished it, Miss Lewis had all but abandoned poetry and embarked on what turned out to be three short historical novels, ''The Wife of Martin Guerre'' (1941), ''The Trial of Soren Qvist'' (1947) and ''The Ghost of Monsieur Scarron'' (1959), all based on actual cases and so compellingly imagined and told that she inspired the 1956 ''Wife of Martin Guerre'' opera by William Bergsman, who asked her to write the libretto. The composer Alva Henderson was so impressed he got her to write the libretto for his 1976 opera, ''The Last of the Mohicans,'' and two others.         The historical novels, Miss Lewis said later, represented the ''heavy thinking'' of a literary career that did not include her poetry. Her poems, she said, were always personal, a quiet corner of her life.         Devastated by her husband's death in 1968, Miss Lewis, who never took his name off the mailbox and maintained his writing shed as a shrine, sought to deal with her grief by revisiting the Southwest, rediscovering her fascination with the local Indians and producing a series of memorable poems.         For Miss Lewis, who is survived by a daughter, Joanna Thomson of Madison, Wis.; a son, Daniel Winters  of Davis, Calif., and three grandchildren, her family was always more important than her work, and her life is well reflected in her final collection, ''The Dear Past,'' (1994) with poems covering most of the century.         Under the influence of her husband, she had done her share of experimenting, but the woman who had begun her career by taking part in the imagist revolution that sought to strip poetry of its former artifice, ended it the same way, using spare, lyrical language to describe and celebrate the simplest scenes of nature.  For a woman who charmed generations of troubled poets and other literary figures with her almost otherworldly serenity, looking back over the domestic scenes of a long, literary life it would be hard to find a more compelling image of Miss Lewis -- or one more evocative of the flesh-and-blood life beneath the surface of 20th-century literature -- than one of the many at the family's house after a warm, rollicking meal with the couple's dearest friends.         You may have to close your eyes to conjure up the sight, but there they are forever, two 1899 contemporaries standing side by side at the kitchen sink, Janet Lewis washing, Vladimir Nabokov drying.         So Enmeshed In Daily Life         These poems by Janet Lewis are both from ''Poems Old and New; 1918-1978,'' Swallow Press/Ohio University Press, 1981.         Mild and slow and young,         She moves about the room,         And stirs the summer dust         With her wide broom.         In the warm, lofted air,         Soft lips together pressed,         Soft wispy hair,         She stops to rest,         And stops to breathe,         Amid the summer hum,         The great white lilac bloom         Scented with days to come.         ''Girl Help'' (1927)         Ah, the woods, the woods         Where small things         Are distinct and visible,         The berry plant,         The berry leaf, remembered         Line for line.         There are three figures         Walking in the woods         Whose feet press down         Needle and leaf and vine.         'The Indians in the Woods'' (1922)       
         Flora Roberts, a dynamic play agent who represented many important theater artists, died on Saturday at New York Hospital. She was 77, and lived in Manhattan and Bridgewater, Conn.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her associate Sarah Douglas.         Stephen Sondheim, Tina Howe, Alfred Uhry, Maury Yeston and others were greatly indebted to Ms. Roberts, who encouraged them to challenge themselves. As she said in an interview earlier this year, ''writers are causes.'' When she believed in someone, she devoted herself wholeheartedly to nurturing the career of that client.         As Mr. Sondheim said, she was ''a protector and an idealist'' who cared more about the work than the contract. She was not known for her power as a negotiator but for her perspicacity in reading scripts and in analyzing a play in production. Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, said Ms. Roberts had ''a real ability to think like a producer, feel like an artist and act like an agent.''         A perfect personification of her first name, Ms. Roberts gave new meaning to the word flamboyant. She was, Ms. Howe said, ''a woman of enormous style, heart, experience, courage, intelligence -- a real original.'' As round as she was short, and fond of wearing large red hats, Ms. Roberts was one of the most colorful people in the American theater, bursting with energy and with a gravelly voice that approached that of a basso profundo. She was outspoken with her ideas and comments and thought nothing of castigating a client if she felt that a play was worthy of improvement.         Her greatest talent was in her instinctive reaction to fine work, no matter where it came from. As she said, ''Fortunately, I have a finger on the pulse.'' Years ago, Frank Loesser sent her a composer who had written a musical that he considered very noncommercial. She listened to the composer play one song on the piano in her apartment, and it gave her goose bumps. The song was ''Sit Down, John''; the musical was ''1776.'' She recommended that the composer, Sherman Edwards, work with Peter Stone (not her client) as a book writer. Then she guided the show to its Broadway success.         When she received a script of ''The Gin Game,'' she wondered who would want to do ''a two-character play about old people,'' then noticed a photograph on her wall of Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in ''The Four-Poster.'' She called Mr. Cronyn, and, buoyed by his enthusiasm, the play quickly rolled into production. The author, D. L. Coburn, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977, one of many honors awarded to Ms. Roberts's clients, including Pulitzers for ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' Mr. Sondheim's ''Sunday in the Park With George'' and ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' a play that she suggested Mr. Uhry write when he was thinking of doing a television mini-series.         She met Mr. Sondheim in the early 1950's when he was working on his first show, ''Saturday Night,'' and he became her longest-running client. From ''West Side Story'' onward, she made creative contributions to his musicals.         Last season, shows that Ms. Roberts represented filled theatrical marquees: Ms. Howe's ''Pride's Crossing,'' the revivals of ''Anne Frank'' and ''1776,'' and, carried over from the previous season, Mr. Uhry's ''Last Night of Ballyhoo'' and the musical ''Titanic.''         Ms. Roberts was born in the Bronx, and studied at the Manhattan School of Music and Hunter College to become an opera singer. At one point she sang for Arturo Toscanini. She remembered that he said, ''Molta musica, but a small voice.'' Eventually, she became something of a diva in real life, and switched from opera to torch songs, which she often sang for friends.         After graduation, she worked as an all-purpose assistant to Kermit Bloomgarden, the producer. One day in the mid-1940's Mr. Bloomgarden gave her a new play to read, Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' When the playwright asked what she thought of it, she offered  frank criticism. In response, Ms. Hellman told the producer to give his assistant a raise, adding, ''She's right, and I don't think I can fix it.''         ''I got a raise,'' said Ms. Roberts, ''and she tried to fix it.''         That same year, Arthur Miller submitted a play (later titled ''All My Sons'') to Mr. Bloomgarden and she advised him to produce it. Able to present only one play at a time, he chose Ms. Hellman's instead, but with Ms. Roberts's encouragement, subsequently produced ''Death of a Salesman.''         In the 1950's, because of her interest in playwrights, she became an agent. One of her first clients was Ira Levin, then a television writer. She got him an assignment adapting the Mac Hyman novel ''No Time for Sergeants,'' first for television, then for Broadway, and she discovered the play's star, Andy Griffith.         Although most of her clients were writers, Ms. Roberts also represented a few directors (Susan Stroman) and designers (Jennifer Tipton). Frequently she had solicitations to join major talent agencies, but she remained fiercely independent and placed great emphasis on personal loyalty. As she said: ''I really love most of my clients. That's a privilege when you're on your own.''         She is survived by her sister, Janet Sovin of Berkeley, Calif., and her brother, David, of Huntington Station, N.Y.         Ms. Roberts's major passions were theater and horses. She owned a racehorse, Allaway, and often visited Belmont Park. At the track or on Broadway, she relied upon her experience and her assessment of form and potential. Sometimes she just took a flier and followed her intuition, as when she bet on a horse named ''Comedy Tonight'' because Mr. Sondheim had written a song by that name. Naturally, she bet on the horse to show, and it did. About her other preoccupation, she said, ''I gamble on the theater every day.''       
         Mildred Baker, an arts administrator and trustee emeritus of the Newark Museum, died on Dec. 9 at the Florence Nightingale Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 93 and was a longtime resident of the Chelsea Hotel in Manhattan.         Born into a musical family in Brooklyn and named Mildred Sophia Weiss, Mrs. Baker became deeply involved with museums and art galleries after marrying an artist, Emil Holzhauer, in 1925. In 1935 she went to work for the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration, later becoming its assistant director. She traveled the country selecting artists' works for more than 500 shows that circulated among more than 100 regional centers.         Soon after the W.P.A. closed its doors in 1943, Mrs. Baker joined the staff of the Newark Museum, where she organized a pioneering show called ''Black Artists'' in 1944.         She became the museum's assistant director in 1949 and its associate director in charge of exhibitions, membership and special events in 1953. Besides being responsible for many additions to the permanent collection, Mrs. Baker founded and was the first editor of ''News Notes,'' the museum's monthly bulletin. After her retirement in 1971, she was elected to the museum's board of trustees.         In the 1960's, she was vice chairman of the Commission to Study the Arts in New Jersey, which led to the creation of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, on which she served until 1975.         Mrs. Baker and Mr. Holzhauer were divorced in 1940, and seven years later she married Jacob Baker, a business executive, and they moved into the Chelsea Hotel. After Mr. Baker's death in 1967 she became a close friend of fellow hotel residents, including the composer Virgil Thomson. The two dined together every Saturday night in the Chelsea Hotel apartment of their friends, Gerald Busby, a composer, and Sam Byers, an advertising executive.         Mrs. Baker, who was a member of the board of the Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation, the Friends Committee of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and the Cosmopolitan Club, remained at the Chelsea until she suffered a stroke last month.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Judith Arron, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall since 1986, died on Friday at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. She was 56 and lived in Chappaqua, N.Y.         The cause was breast cancer, Carnegie Hall officials said yesterday.         Ms. Arron presided over probably the most momentous years of Carnegie Hall since its rescue from the wrecking ball in 1960. The exhaustive $60 million renovation of the hall in 1986 happened on her watch, as well as the seasonlong and highly festive centennial celebration of 1990-91.         Ms. Arron used the refurbishment of Carnegie Hall's smaller Weill Recital Hall as an opportunity to transform it from a rental space to an important venue for events produced by the Hall. They included debut series, chamber music events, jazz concerts and a new music series administered by the Carnegie Hall Composer's Chair, which is currently held by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich.         Under Ms. Arron, the Hall promoted and extended educational programs, with workshops overseen by musicians like Robert Shaw and Pierre Boulez. In partnership with the Hall's president, the violinist Isaac Stern, and its chairman, Sanford Weill, Ms. Arron began an endowment campaign in 1995 and had raised $87 million to date.         Ms. Arron came to Carnegie Hall from Cincinnati, where she was the Cincinnati Symphony's manager and the director of its May Festival. Her work in developing educational programs there in 1969 was admired in orchestra circles. Before that, Ms. Arron had worked for the American Symphony Orchestra League and a Government arts program.         Ms. Arron was born in Seattle and graduated from the University of Puget Sound with a performance degree in cello and piano. Her husband, Ronald D. Arron, is a violinist with the Met Orchestra.         Mr. Stern said yesterday that Ms. Arron's health in the last two weeks had been ''touch and go'' but that her eight-and-a-half-year battle with cancer had been ''a miracle'' and a victory of ''will and heart over doctors and medicine.''         At her death, Ms. Arron was preparing to bring yet another performing space to Carnegie Hall, a below-ground area long occupied by the Carnegie Hall Cinema to be equipped with high-tech appurtenances and intended for smaller opera productions and experimental work.         Ms. Arron is survived, in addition to her husband, by two sons, Joseph and Edward of Manhattan; her parents, Richard and Berenice Hagerty La Quinta, Calif.; a sister, Colleen Fretz of Belize, and two brothers, Richard Hagerty Jr. of Modesto, Calif., and Dale Hagerty also of La Quinta.         Correction:  December 25, 1998, Friday  An obituary on Monday, and in some copies on Sunday, about Judith Arron, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, misstated the position of her husband, Ronald D. Arron, in the Metropolitan Opera  Orchestra. He is a violist, not a violinist.
