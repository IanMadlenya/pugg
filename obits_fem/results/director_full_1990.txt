        Rose Kushner, a vigorous and tenacious advocate for women with breast cancer, died Sunday of the disease. She was 60 years old and lived in Kensington, Md.         Rose Kushner, a vigorous and tenacious advocate for women with breast cancer, died Sunday of the disease. She was 60 years old and lived in Kensington, Md.         Ms. Kushner gained national recognition in 1975, when she wrote about her battle with breast cancer in a book, ''Why Me? What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer to Save Her Life,'' published by W. B. Saunders Company in Philadelphia. She became an influential voice questioning standard medical procedures and was a leader in the movement to change the way the disease is treated.         Many of the steps she advocated, especially less radical surgery, were at first rejected by leading breast cancer experts but are now common practice.         As the founder and director of the Breast Cancer Advisory Center in Kensington, Ms. Kushner provided women with crucial information about their options when facing breast cancer.         'Poetic Justice' in Award         She was a member of the National Breast Cancer Advisory Board from 1980 to 1986 and was appointed last year to the American Cancer Society's Breast Cancer Task Force.         This year, Ms. Kushner will be awarded the Society of Surgical Oncology's James Ewing Award for outstanding contributions by a lay person to the fight against cancer. This is ''poetic justice,'' said her husband, Harvey D. Kushner, because the society's members had ''booed her off their stage in 1975,'' after she had challenged their standard treatments.         ''A lot of people heard about her and trusted her,'' said Dr. Bruce A. Chabner, director of the division of cancer treatment at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.         At the time of her death, Ms. Kushner was lobbying to encourage the Federal Government to require that health insurance companies cover mammograms.         A psychologist and medical writer, Ms. Kushner turned single-mindedly to her breast cancer crusade in 1974, when she found a lump in her breast but refused to submit to the then routine ''one step'' procedure.         In the mid-1970's, women would be anesthetized, the lump would be removed for biopsy on the spot and, if it was malignant, the breast would be removed. The patient would learn only upon awakening whether she had lost a breast. Ms. Kushner believed that women needed time after a cancer diagnosis to find the best surgeon to remove the breast.         She railed against the one-step procedure and, after 18 telephone calls, finally found a general surgeon to remove just her lump. She later found a breast cancer specialist to remove her breast when the lump proved cancerous.         Role in Changing Practice         Now, the one-step procedure that Ms. Kushner abhorred is no longer done.         ''She is probably the single most important person in leading to this major change in breast surgery,'' Dr. Chabner said. Although there was medical evidence that the one-step procedure was not advisable, Dr. Chabner added, ''I don't think the public would have accepted it or even known about it if she had not been so persistent in her efforts.''         Later, Ms. Kushner became an advocate for increased use of lumpectomy, in which the malignant lump is removed but the rest of the breast is left.         Ms. Kushner was born in Baltimore and graduated from the University of Maryland in 1972.         She is survived by her husband, Harvey; her sons, Gantt of Silver Spring, Md., and Todd of Rockville, Md.; a daughter, Lesley Kushner of San Francisco, and her brothers, Isaac and Meyer Rehert of Baltimore and Paul Rehert of West Palm Beach, Fla.

        India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         Mrs. Edwards was unanimously elected to the national committee in 1950. She was first associated with the committee as a volunteer in the 1944 Presidential campaign. From 1945 to 1947 she was executive secretary of the women's division, which she served as associate director before becoming the committee's vice chairwoman.         Mrs. Edwards remained active in the Democratic Party for more than 30 years, through several generations of Democratic politicians, including Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.         For 22 years before she became active in politics she was on the staff of The Chicago Tribune, where she was society editor and woman's editor. She left the paper to marry her third husband, Herbert T. Edwards, a State Department official, and moved to Washington in 1942. Mr. Edwards died in the late 1970's.         Campaigning With Truman         Mrs. Edwards accompanied Mr. Truman, her political hero, on his 1948 campaign tour, where she repeatedly expressed her confidence in his victory at the polls.         At one point the President turned to her and sighed. ''India,'' he said, ''sometimes I think there are only two people who believe I will win. You and me.'' ''That's enough,'' she replied. Largely because of Mrs. Edwards's influence, Mr. Truman appointed more women to top jobs than any preceding President. Among them were Eugenia Anderson as Ambassador to Denmark, Perle Mesta as Minister to Luxembourg, Ruth Bryan Rohde as an alternate delegate to the United Nations and Georgia Neese Clark as Treasurer of the United States.         Explaining how she worked to increase the number of women in Federal jobs, Mrs. Edwards recalled: ''Sometimes I felt like a ghoul. I'd read the obits, and as soon as a man had died, I'd rush over to the White House and suggest a woman to replace him.''         Mrs. Edwards, who was named for her mother and her grandmother, was born in Chicago and grew up in Nashville. Her memoirs, ''Pulling No Punches,'' were published by G. P. Putnam's in 1977.         Mrs. Edward's daughter, India Moffett Williams, died in 1979, and her son, John Holbrook Moffett, died in World War II. She is survived by five grandchildren.

Evelyn Ames, a poet and prose writer whose works on wildlife and the environment were praised by reviewers as graceful and intense, but not sentimental, died on Thursday at St. Johnland Nursing Home in Kings Park, L.I. She was 81 years old and had homes in Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., and Martha's Vineyard.         ''A Glimpse of Eden,'' recounting a safari in East Africa, joined ''a poet's urge to describe her experience in beautiful and even fanciful terms, and a thinker's urge to generalize about it,'' wrote Orville Prescott in a 1967 review in The New York Times.         ''She strikes just the right note when she remarks on the bond of sympathy she felt for lions,'' the critic wrote, concluding, ''It takes a poet like Evelyn Ames to see the 'tender affection' of lions.'' John C. Devlin of The Times termed the work ''sharp-eyed and lyrical.''         Other volumes included ''In Time Like Glass: Reflections on a Journey in Asia'' (1974); ''Only the Loving,'' a 1952 novel; and two books of poetry: ''The Hawk From Heaven'' (1957) and ''Dust on a Precipice'' (1981).

She left in 1968 to become ballet mistress of the Manhattan Festival Ballet. She also taught at Juilliard School and the Manhattan School of Dance, and for many summers at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. She continued to teach at Manhattan School into her 90's. Among her students were Melissa Hayden, Hugh Laing, Nora Kaye, Carmen Mathe, Paul Taylor and Sallie Wilson.         Injury Ended Performing         Miss Craske was born in Norfolk, England. She began her professional career dancing in music halls. Serge Diaghilev chose her for his company in 1920 after seeing her in a class taught by Cecchetti. When a serious foot injury forced her to stop performing, Cecchetti asked her to help him teach at his London studio. In 1931, she set off for India to study with Meher Baba, an Indian guru. She remained with him for seven years and continued as a disciple for the rest of her life.         An austere, private woman with a sense of humor, Miss Craske was an extremely popular teacher who was known for the consistency and clarity of classes in which she would sometimes spend hours on a single step. ''She was a tiny woman - maybe all of five feet tall - with little feet in pink ballet slippers,'' a student, Nancy Reed, told Klasina VanderWerse for a 1983 feature on Miss Craske in Ballet News. ''She'd wear bell-bottomed trousers to teach in, and her feet would dart out of the trousers like hummingbirds, the pants flapping.''         Like Cecchetti, Miss Craske stressed exact technique and attention to detail in her teaching, emphasizing balance and encouraging her students to pay attention to the quality of movement and the anatomical and physiological workings of the body.         Friendly Competitiveness         Miss Craske was thought by many to have influenced Tudor's choreographic style, though she herself dismissed the notion. She and Tudor ''nipped'' at each other's teaching, as one student put it, as colleagues at the Metropolitan, with Tudor sometimes teaching students wild variations on the strict steps and gestures she had taught them the day before.         Like Tudor, however, she believed that movement must ''mean something,'' as she put it. ''There is no room in the world for dancers running around and around the stage and then kicking their right ear,'' she said in a 1983 interview. ''That doesn't mean a thing.''         Miss Craske retired from teaching in 1986, moving to Myrtle Beach, where she had served as a director of the Meher Spiritual Center for 11 years.         She was the author of two standard references on the Cecchetti technique: ''The Theory and Practice of Allegro in Classical Ballet,'' written with C. W. Beaumont in 1950, and ''The Theory and Practice of Advanced Allegro in Classical Ballet,'' written with Derra de Moroda in 1956. She also wrote ''The Dance of Love,'' published in 1980, and the recent ''Still Dancing with Love,'' a journal of her work with Meher Baba.       
        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''       
        Lillian Lidman Greneker, a sculptor and inventor who created movable mannequins, died on Jan. 28 at the nursing home of the Actors' Fund in Englewood, N.J. She was 95 years old.         Lillian Lidman Greneker, a sculptor and inventor who created movable mannequins, died on Jan. 28 at the nursing home of the Actors' Fund in Englewood, N.J. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Greneker was also an architect, contractor, bricklayer and corporation president. She received her architectural and building experience when she drew plans for and built four large stone houses and several small ones in Mount Kisco, N.Y.         Married to Claude P. Greneker, who was for many years publicity director for the Shubert theater interests, she became interested in mannequins when her husband wanted to use some in a theater stunt. To Mrs. Greneker's astonishment, she found that most mannequins were virtual statues and, in 1937, decided to make her own.         She began by forming heads and hands of cellophane and moved on to papier-mache, developing the flexible waist and adding mobility to the mannequins manufactured by the Greneker Corporation. She became president of the company.         The mannequins had carpenter-made joints and rubber ribs, for pliable body parts; horsehair wigs, and theatrical makeup. They appeared in the windows of Fifth Avenue stores like Bergdorf Goodman, Bonwit Teller and B. Altman.         Mrs. Greneker also created a series of thimble tools - paintbrushes, pencils, screwdrivers and the like - that could be attached to fingertips. They did not catch on.         In World War II, her factory in Pleasantville, N.Y., turned to military work. At the request of the United States Rubber Company, she invented and manufactured forms for self-sealing gasoline tanks for Navy warplanes.         After the war she turned to portrait sculpture, and her heads of actresses were widely exhibited.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Daphne Barritt-Vane Arnstein, an arts patron who founded the Harlem Cultural Council and was a co-founder of the Jazzmobile, died of heart disease Saturday in Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Daphne Barritt-Vane Arnstein, an arts patron who founded the Harlem Cultural Council and was a co-founder of the Jazzmobile, died of heart disease Saturday in Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Arnstein and the pianist and composer Billy Taylor founded the Jazzmobile 25 years ago to bring summer programs of free live music performed by prominent musicians to various New York neighborhoods. She served on the board of Jazzmobile, which also conducts year-round workshops, lectures and demonstrations. For her role in Jazzmobile's creation, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller presented Mrs. Arnstein with the New York State Council on the Arts Award.         Mrs. Arnstein also founded Bands of Steel, a music training program; Festival on the River, and Speakeasy, a dialogue between grade school children and the elderly. She served on the jazz council of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians and took part in the breakfast feeding program of St. Peter's Lutheran Church.         Mrs. Arnstein, a native of Tonbridge, England, came to the United States in 1941. She worked for Russian War Relief, became director of the Westchester Chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews and president of the Utopia Day Care Center in Harlem.         Surviving are two sons, Simon, of Baltimore, and Nelson B., of Santa Monica, Calif.; a daughter, Gemma Rettman of Eugene, Ore., and two grandchildren.

Grace O'Brien O'Neill, a child psychologist who developed innovative programs for the New York City Department of Health in the 1950's, died of cardiac arrest on Feb. 15 at Reston Hospital in Virginia. She was 87 years old and had lived in Leonia, N.J., for 60 years.         Mrs. O'Neill, working for the Health Department, was a pioneer in ''well baby'' treatment, in which pediatricians monitor the development of healthy children. She later became director of the World Federation of Mental Health.         She was born in Kansas City, Mo., and received bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology from the University of Minnesota. At the Cleveland Child Guidance Institute, which she joined after leaving the university, she made studies that led to acceptance in the United States of the psychological test created by Hermann Rorschach in Switzerland in 1921.         She is survived by a son, Eugene, of Reston; two daughters, Sheila, of Westport, Conn., and Mona Sharkey of Elverson, Pa.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

        Li Zhen, a veteran of the Long March and the first woman to become a general in China, died on March 11, China Daily said today. She was 83 years old.         Li Zhen, a veteran of the Long March and the first woman to become a general in China, died on March 11, China Daily said today. She was 83 years old.         President Yang Shangkun and military officers paid last respects to her on Thursday, the newspaper said. It did not give the cause of death.         Miss Li was promoted to major general in 1955 and until 1988 was the only woman serving as a general in the Chinese Army, China Daily said. The 3.5 million-member army is now believed to have four women who are generals.         Official biographies say she was born in Liuyang, in Hunan Province, and given away by her parents at age 6. In 1926, she fled her husband and joined the Communist Party. She took part in the 1927 Autumn Uprising in Hunan, Mao's first attempt to lead peasants in revolt against the authorities.         She took part in the 1934-35 Long March, the Red Army's epic escape from the ruling Nationalists to northern China, and held political positions in the army. The Communists defeated the Nationalists and took power in 1949.         She served as director of the Political Department of the Chinese military force in Korea during the Korean War.

Victoria Crandall, a theatrical producer who for three decades staged Broadway musicals for summer audiences in Maine, died Sunday at a hospital in New York. She was 81 years old.         Miss Crandall, a resident of Wiscasset, Me., had been in New York to cast roles for the Maine State Music Theater's coming season.         Miss Crandall, a former concert pianist, in 1959 founded the Brunswick Summer Playhouse, which later became the Brunswick Music Theater. The name was changed again two years ago to the Maine State Music Theater, with Miss Crandall serving as executive director and artistic director.         The theater, on the Bowdoin College campus, rejected packaged shows in favor of originally designed productions. Over the last three decades, Miss Crandall staged 186 productions with audiences totaling more than 1.5 million people.         Born in Cleveland to Swedish immigrants, Miss Crandall was a graduate of the Eastman School of Music in Rochester. She went on to become a rehearsal pianist, working with performers like Ethel Merman and Jimmy Durante and with composers and lyricists like Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe.

        Helen Hoke, who wrote nearly 100 children's books and set up and ran children's book divisions in five publishing companies, died of bronchial pneumonia on Monday in a nursing home in Bethesda, Md. She was 86 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         Helen Hoke, who wrote nearly 100 children's books and set up and ran children's book divisions in five publishing companies, died of bronchial pneumonia on Monday in a nursing home in Bethesda, Md. She was 86 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         Humor, natural history, the supernatural and witchcraft were the subjects of many of Ms. Hoke's books. She also specialized in anthologies of ghost stories, one of which she wrote with her grandson, Franklin Hoke.         Among her other books for young readers were ''The Horse That Took the Milk Around,'' ''Too Many Kittens,'' ''Factory Kitty'' and ''Grocery Kitty.''         In the late 1930's, Ms. Hoke inaugurated and managed children's book departments at several publishing houses, including Henry Holt, Reynal & Hitchcock and Julian Messer. In the 1940's, Ms. Hoke, whose first marriage, to John Hoke, had ended in divorce, married Franklin Watts, founder the New York publishing company that bears his name. She became the company's vice president and director of international projects.         She and her husband established Franklin Watts Ltd. in London in the 1960's, and Ms. Hoke worked there into the 1970's before returning to the United States. Ms. Hoke also organized Helen Hoke Associates, which represented authors, and oversaw publication of books from inception to marketing. Her son, John Hoke, said she was ''awfully good at finding new authors.''         In the 1970's she began naming her books with what she called ''Terrific Triple Titles.'' Among these books were, ''Witches, Witches, Witches,'' ''Jokes, Jokes, Jokes'' and ''Nurses, Nurses, Nurses,'' an anthology of short stories, poems and excerpts from biographies and novels.         Jean Vestal of Franklin Watts said one of Ms. Hoke's contributions to children's book publishing was her early support of the Bologna International Children's Book Fair in Italy, which has become an important element in the industry.         Ms. Hoke and her son, a photographer and writer, wrote ''Music Boxes: Their Lore and Lure'' in 1957. It was her 32d book and her first nonfiction work.         Ms. Hoke was also executive director of the Julia Ellsworth Ford Foundation, which conducted annual children's book competitions.         Surviving are her son, who lives in Bethesda, and four grandchildren.       
        Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan.         Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         During her 20 years as curator, Dr. Szladits scoured England to bargain for diaries and first editions; in this country, she cajoled American authors to think of the Berg first when parting with their papers. In the faintly discernible accent of her native Hungary, she was fond of joking, though without affectation, ''Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.''         Everyone from the president of the library to her assistants called Dr. Szladits by her first name. She, in turn, was on a first-name basis with her precious manuscripts. When she spoke of ''Tom,'' she meant T. S. Eliot, of ''Wystan,'' W. H. Auden, and of ''Virginia,'' her greatly admired diarist and novelist, Virginia Woolf.         Sitting in her cramped office off the Berg's reading and exhibition rooms on the third floor of the library on Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, Dr. Szladits liked to reach for the exact quotation from one of the tens of thousands of documents in the collection.         'We Protect the Written Word'         Last year, when she mounted a show on diarists, it included 50 of her famous authors, including James Boswell, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville and, of course, Virginia Woolf, whose manuscripts in 33 volumes are one of the prizes in the Berg. She liked to quote ''Virginia,'' who said, ''Fortunately, intellect has no gender.''         Dr. Szladits considered the Berg not a musty repository of the past but a working collection that was used by biographers from all over the world.         ''We protect the written word at the Berg,'' she told Whitney Balliett, who wrote a profile about her in The New Yorker on Dec. 31, 1984 - the first such article about a librarian in the magazine's history. ''It is a research collection, not a museum. It has to be used. It is alive. My role at the Berg is to stand still and allow the collection to grow. In fact, I try to make time itself stand still here. I try to create quiet and the timelessness that allows for the pursuit of truth.''         Auden's Handwritten Notebooks         Born in Budapest, she immigrated to the United States in 1950 and became a naturalized citizen in 1956. After receiving her doctorate in Hungary, she did postgraduate work at the Sorbonne in Paris, University College in London and Columbia University. She joined the New York Public Library in 1955 and was appointed curator of the Berg Collection in 1969.         Among her most significant acquisitions were Auden's handwritten notebooks. She also established or expanded files on Conrad Aiken, H. G. Wells, Muriel Rukeyser, Evelyn Waugh, Samuel Beckett, William Faulkner, May Sarton, Washington Irving, Walt Whitman and Oliver Wendell Holmes.         ''I am buying in eternity,'' Dr. Szladits once remarked.         Paul Fasana, the library's Andrew W. Mellon Director of Research Libraries, said yesterday: ''Lola was an original. Her standards, for herself and others, were high and at times unattainable. Her dedication to the ideal of literary scholarship was fierce. But she was also loving and human.''         Dr. Szladits was married to Charles Szladits, a professor of law at Columbia University, who died in 1986.         A memorial service will be held on May 5 in the Celeste Bartos Forum of the library, and a book fund in her name will be established for the Berg Collection.       
        Sister Thea Bowman, a nationally active black educator who with song, prayer and persistent exhortation urged the Roman Catholic Church to embrace the culture of African Americans, died of cancer on Friday at her home in Canton, Miss. She was 52 years old.         Sister Thea Bowman, a nationally active black educator who with song, prayer and persistent exhortation urged the Roman Catholic Church to embrace the culture of African Americans, died of cancer on Friday at her home in Canton, Miss. She was 52 years old.         Eight months ago, at a semiannual meeting of the nation's Catholic bishops in South Orange, N.J., Sister Thea, suffering from breast and bone cancer, brought the assembly to its feet with an address depicting the black experience in America. She then asked the prelates to cross arms, clasp hands and sing ''We Shall Overcome.''         ''You've got to move together to do that,'' she told them.         But the work of Sister Thea, a Canton native who was the granddaughter of a slave, was far more than symbolic.         She was director of the Office of Intercultural Affairs for the Diocese of Jackson, Miss., and served on the faculty of the Institute of Black Catholic Studies at Xavier University in New Orleans. Last year, Mary Lou Jennings of Stowe, Vt., and the Rev. Thomas F. X. Hoar of Winooski, Vt., established the Sister Thea Bowman Black Catholic Educational Foundation to provide financial support for black students at all educational levels.         ''She was an outstanding woman,'' said Bishop Joseph Houck of the Diocese of Jackson. ''She was proud of her heritage and totally dedicated to the vision of Jesus Christ for love and growth of all people.''         Sister Thea was to receive the Laetare Medal, the oldest and most prestigious award given to American Catholics, at the University of Notre Dame's commencement exercises on May 20. The award will be posthumously presented, the university said Friday.         Working and Praying Together         Much of the work of Sister Thea, the only black member of the Franciscan Sisters of Perpetual Adoration, was done through music.         ''When I came into the Catholic Church in the 1940's,'' she said in an interview in 1987, ''we had to leave behind us the music that was an expression of the spirituality of our home, community and upbringing. People were teaching us uniformity.''         The uniformity began to break down in the early 1960's, she said, when the Second Vatican Council encouraged expressions of ethnic heritage. She recorded an album of 15 spirituals, ''Sister Thea: Songs of My People,'' in 1988.         ''There's a black church that transcends denominations,'' Sister Thea said in the 1987 interview. ''If we work together, play together, stand together, pray together, then we can create a new heaven.''         She is survived by three cousins, Barbara Barber, Anita Scott and Johnie Middleton, all of Jackson.       
        Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         Greta Garbo, the enigmatic and elusive star of some of Hollywood's most memorable romantic movies of the 1930's and a 50-year focus of curiosity and myth, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 years old.         A hospital spokesman, Andrew Banoff, saying he was respecting the wishes of the family, provided no details of her death, and said services would be private.         The Swedish-born actress had a classic beauty and a natural talent for conveying deep emotions before a camera. Her performances in such classics as ''Anna Christie,'' ''Grand Hotel,'' ''Queen Christina,'' ''Anna Karenina,'' ''Camille'' and ''Ninotchka'' were an arresting mix of urbaneness and vulnerability, with a glint of mockery.         The Screen's Great Sufferer         The finest element in a Garbo film was Garbo. She invariably played a disillusioned woman of the world who falls hopelessly and giddily in love. Tragedy is often imminent, and her tarnished-lady roles usually required her to die or otherwise give up her lover. No one could suffer like Garbo.         Mysterious and aloof, she appealed to both men and women, and she exerted a major influence on women's fashions, hair styles and makeup. On screen and off, she was a remote figure of loveliness.         Garbo's career spanned only 19 years. In 1941, at the age of 36, she made the last of her 27 movies, a slight comedy called ''Two Faced Woman.'' She went into what was to be temporary retirement, but she never returned to the screen.         Yet generations later, her best movies were shown on television, in sold-out retrospectives and in revival houses, and she remained one of the greatest screen actresses, evergreen, eternally young.         In the 1930's she was called ''the screen's first lady,'' the standard against whom others were judged. Andre Sennwald wrote in The New York Times that she was ''the most miraculous blend of personality the screen has ever seen.'' Alistair Cooke termed her ''every man's fantasy mistress.'' The French called her ''La Divine.'' And Kenneth Tynan concluded, ''What when drunk one sees in other women, one sees in Garbo sober.''         For more than half a century, the actress remained an enigma, ''the Swedish sphinx,'' because of her deep fear of reporters and other strangers and her insistence on guarding her privacy. Ironically, in seeking to avoid publicity, she became one of the most publicized women in the world.         Her penchant for privacy broke all of Hollywood's rules, said her biographer, John Bainbridge. Except at the start of her career, he wrote in ''Garbo,'' she ''granted no interviews, signed no autographs, attended no premieres, answered no fan mail.''         A declaration often attributed to her was, ''I want to be alone.'' Actually she said, ''I want to be let alone.''         Her screen image was exotic and inscrutable, while her private life was simple, even mundane. In a rare statement to reporters she acknowledged, ''I feel able to express myself only through my roles, not in words, and that is why I try to avoid talking to the press.''         Garbo's aloofness frustrated the press, which published thousands of photographs of her frantically clutching a drooping hat over her face as she shopped or raced for a train, ship or plane.         Speculations About Her Escorts         Her presumed love affairs - she was never known to have married - were the subject of voluminous gossip and speculation. Over the decades her frequent escorts included the actor John Gilbert; the conductor Leopold Stokowski; the nutrition theorist Gayelord Hauser; Baron Erich Goldschmidt-Rothschild, an art connoisseur, and George Schlee, a figure in haute couture.         Garbo's movies earned her more than $3 million, a record at a time of low income taxes, and her frugality and astute investments, particularly in Manhattan real estate, increased her wealth. Her life had begun in virtual poverty.         Greta Lovisa Gustafsson was born in Stockholm on Sept. 18, 1905, the daughter of Karl Alfred and Anna Lovisa Gustafsson. Her father was an unskilled laborer of peasant stock who was often out of work.         The family lived in a shabby district of Stockholm, and Greta had to leave school at the age of 13 to help care for her seriously ill father. Every week she took him to a charity clinic, where they had to wait hours for his treatment. She vowed to build her life so she would never be financially dependent.         Her father died when she was 14 and she had to go to work, first as a latherer in a barber shop and then as a salesclerk in a department store.         Her beauty soon gained her a role in a short film sponsored by the store, a part in a publicity short for a bakery and then a leading role as a frolicking bathing beauty in a slapstick feature, ''Peter the Tramp.''         She won a two-year scholarship to Stockholm's Royal Dramatic Theater Academy, where she was discovered by Mauritz Stiller, a famous, worldly and flamboyant director. He and Victor Seastrom were the leaders of the golden age of Swedish silent movies.         The 40-year-old Mr. Stiller took absolute command of the professional and private life of the 17-year-old novice. He named her Garbo and cast her as the ingenue in his film epic of Selma Lagerlof's novel ''Saga of Gosta Berling.''         Doubts in Sweden, A Hit in Berlin         The four-hour movie drew mixed notices in Stockholm, but a three-hour version was a hit in Berlin, where reviewers found Garbo ''a soul-revealing Nordic princess.'' Her next role was as a poor prospective prostitute in ''Streets of Sorrow,'' directed by G. W. Pabst.         Louis B. Mayer, the production chief of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, saw ''Gosta Berling'' in Berlin and offered Mr. Stiller a contract. He accepted on condition that his plump protegee also be hired. Mr. Mayer agreed reluctantly, muttering, ''In America, men don't like fat women.''         The first of Garbo's 24 Hollywood movies, all made for M-G-M, was ''The Torrent,'' a 1926 melodrama starring the Latin lover Ricardo Cortez. The daily rushes revealed the young actress's extraordinary film-acting talent, and her salary was raised before the movie was released.         As soon as a camera began rolling, the awkward girl with the moody eyes and large hands suddenly and charismatically sprang to life. Now slimmer and only 20, she played a seductive Spanish peasant who becomes an opera star. She was an overnight sensation.         Mr. Stiller, still smarting from being barred from directing ''The Torrent,'' began directing her in ''The Temptress,'' a variation of ''The Torrent'' starring another Latin, Antonio Moreno. The director had repeated arguments with M-G-M executives and was abruptly dismissed in mid-shooting. He went to Paramount Pictures, but soon also antagonized executives there, and they let him go. Unable to hold a job in Hollywood, he returned to Sweden in 1928. Within a year, he died of several ailments at the age of 45.         His death devastated Garbo, who was said to feel deep guilt for many years for not returning to Sweden to see him. His dynamic personality set the pattern for her later lovers.         A Movie Succeeds And Rumors Fly         Her third Hollywood role was a heartless adulteress in ''Flesh and the Devil,'' co-starring John Gilbert, the epitome of silent-movie masculinity. Their love scenes, peppered with suggestive gestures and language, were electrifying. Reports of a Garbo-Gilbert romance swept the country, and their passionate on-screen lovemaking was regarded as a reflection of their off-screen lives. The gossip fueled the movie's triumph.         M-G-M then co-starred the couple in ''Love,'' a 1927 modern-dress version of Tolstoy's ''Anna Karenina,'' another huge success.         In only two years, Garbo became a superstar. By shrewd negotiating, threatening to return to Sweden and staging a strike, she also won unheard-of raises. In only three years, her weekly salary soared from $350 to $5,000, and six years later she won a record $270,000 per movie.         She made seven more silent films in two years, ''The Divine Woman,'' portraying Sarah Bernhardt; ''The Mysterious Lady''; ''A Woman of Affairs,'' which was adapted from the novel ''The Green Hat'' by Michael Arlen; ''Wild Orchids''; ''The Single Standard,'' and ''The Kiss.'' All made money despite the new dominance of sound movies.         Off screen, there were continuing rumors of a Garbo-Gilbert love affair, with photographers invariably dogging them. There was gossip about an abortive elopement and reports of a wedding ceremony at which she failed to appear. At any rate, apparently weary of the actor's overbearing bravado, she ended the relationship in 1929.         Talkies were destroying the careers of many Europeans, and M-G-M delayed Garbo's sound debut more than two years. She was astutely presented in an adaptation of Eugene O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' where her accent was appropriate. The publicity slogan was simply: ''Garbo Talks!''         Her speech was heavily accented and husky, but this new dimension of the Swedish enigma gave her even greater stature, and the movie played to packed houses across the country. Her opening line of dialogue was widely quoted and became classic:. She wearily enters a waterfront saloon and orders the bartender to ''Gimme a visky with chincher ale on the side -and don't be stingy, baby.''         Garbo's other early sound movies included ''Susan Lenox: Her Fall and Rise'' (1931), co-starring Clark Gable; ''Mata Hari'' (1932), with Ramon Novarro, and a version of Luigi Pirandello's mystical play ''As You Desire Me'' (1932), co-starring Melvyn Douglas, in which she adroitly portrayed an amnesiac.         An adaptation of Vicki Baum's novel ''Grand Hotel'' featured four other stars - John and Lionel Barrymore, Joan Crawford and Wallace Beery -but Garbo, as a fading ballerina, stole the movie. The film, directed by Edmund Goulding, won an Academy Award as the best picture of 1932.         M-G-M honored Garbo's distaste for publicity and her insistence that all visitors be barred from her sets. When close-ups were shot, black screens were placed around Garbo and the camera. Asked why she objected to visitors, she said: ''When people are watching, I'm just a woman making faces for the camera. It destroys the illusion.''         Questioned about the screens, she said, ''If I am by myself, my face will do things I cannot do with it otherwise.''         Old Co-star Tries To Regain Career         Despite these demands, her directors and other associates respected her thorough professionalism and lack of temperament and admired her graciousness.         ''Queen Christina'' (1933) gave Garbo a long-sought chance to portray the eccentric 17th-century Swedish monarch. She co-starred with Mr. Gilbert in an effort to bolster his sagging career. Sound had revealed his thin voice, totally inadequate for his image of a dashing lover. He did well in ''Queen Christina,'' but his career continued to wither. He drank heavily, and died of a heart attack in 1936 at the age of 41.         The largely fictional ''Queen Christina'' provided Garbo with one of her most radiant roles. The tragic film ended with an enormous five-and-a-half-second-long close-up of her face as she stood on the prow of a ship. The queen has given up her throne for her lover, who is now dead. She is taking his body back to Spain and then faces a voyage to nowhere.         Her breathtaking and mystical expression has often been likened to that of the Mona Lisa. Rouben Mamoulian, who directed, told her the audience must use its imagination to interpret her thoughts, and instructed her ''to make your face a mask, to think and feel nothing.''         Recalling the movie after 50 years, Mr. Mamoulian revealed in a 1983 interview that Garbo had often directed herself. ''When we got to the first intimate scene, she asked me to leave the set.'' he said. ''I asked her why. She said, 'During these scenes I allow only the cameraman and lighting man on the set. The director goes out for a coffee or a milkshake.' I replied, 'When I'm directing a movie, I don't go out for a milkshake.' Reluctantly, she agreed I could stay.''         Garbo's title roles in ''Anna Karenina,'' with Fredric March, and an adaptation of Alexandre Dumas fils's ''Camille,'' co-starring a youthful Robert Taylor, were two of her finest performances. They won her the New York Film Critics Awards for best actress in 1935 and 1936.         She never received an Oscar for best actress. But in 1955 the motion picture academy sought to make amends by awarding her a special Oscar for ''a series of luminous and unforgettable performances.''         Comedy Is Tried To Reclaim Fans         By the late 1930's Garbo's box-office appeal was declining, and M-G-M's solution was to have her do her first comedy. The vehicle was ''Ninotchka,'' a brilliant satire written by Billy Wilder, Charles Brackett and Walter Reisch and directed by Ernst Lubitsch. Garbo superbly played a humorless, self-absorbed Soviet envoy who is humanized by Paris and the urbane Melvyn Douglas. The slogan for the 1939 movie read, ''Garbo Laughs.''         Her second comedy was ''Two Faced Woman,'' a frivolous, heartless farce and her only unsuccessful movie. Meanwhile, the European market, which provided the major income from her pictures, was largely cut off by World War II, and M-G-M refused to meet her salary demands. She announced her retirement.         During the war, Garbo was criticized for not aiding the Allies. But in 1976, in a book titled ''A Man Called Intrepid: The Secret War,'' William Stevenson disclosed that she had helped Britain by identifying high-level Nazi sympathizers in Stockholm and by providing introductions and carrying messages for British agents.         Garbo hoped to return to movies after the war. There were repeated reports over two decades of projects that were to include her, but, for various reasons, none ever materialized.         In later years, Garbo called herself ''a wanderer'' and traveled often to Switzerland, the French Riviera and Italy, though she became an American citizen in 1951. For more than 40 years her home base was a Manhattan apartment on East 52d Street, overlooking the East River.         She was as secretive about her relatives as about herself, and the names of her survivors could not immediately be learned.         Usually alone, Garbo regularly strolled, shopped and browsed in the East 50's and 60's, where New Yorkers savored fleeting glimpses of her haunting face. She wore fashionable but simple outfits, large hats and flat shoes and almost no makeup.         The occasional descriptions of her offered by friends suggest she had a childlike innocence and was selfish and self-absorbed. They deplored the aimlessness of her life. But another friend, Jane Gunther, said, ''She has a poetic magic, so difficult to describe, and all one knows is that one wants this in one's life.''         Assaying Garbo's art and life, John Bainbridge offered this tribute:         ''She did nothing that was second-rate. She had dignity and nobility. Like so many great actresses, she may never have possessed a particle of intellectual power, but she had genius before the camera because she was guided by a secret, sublime, infallible instinct to do the right thing in the right way. So unerring was her instinct that it produced the illusion of a most subtle intelligence.''         The Films Before the Solitude         These are Greta Garbo's most important films. Her first talkie was ''Anna Christie.''

        Helene Pons, a leading costume designer for almost four decades until her retirement in 1965, died of kidney problems yesterday at a private clinic in Rome. She was within two weeks of her 92d birthday.         Helene Pons, a leading costume designer for almost four decades until her retirement in 1965, died of kidney problems yesterday at a private clinic in Rome. She was within two weeks of her 92d birthday.         Mrs. Pons designed and executed the costumes for such shows as ''Our Town,'' ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' ''Babes in Arms'' and ''The Time of the Cuckoo.'' She also executed the designs for scores of other shows, including ''My Fair Lady,'' ''Camelot,'' ''Kiss Me Kate'' and ''Pal Joey'' and for many productions of the Metropolitan Opera Company, American Ballet Theater and the New York City Ballet.         She once noted that one of her most troublesome stage designs was the slip worn by Barbara Bel Geddes in the original 1955 production of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' The slip was remade several times because ''she had to be decent,'' Mrs. Pons said. ''Yet it had to look just like any ordinary slip you buy in a store,'' she added.         Known for her fractured pronunciation - speaking French with a Russian accent and English with a French accent - she was also, at times, impatient and explosive. She was said to have once screamed at an assistant, in one breath, ''You go to hell and be sure to get back here by 4:30!''         Running a Studio         Mrs. Pons, the former Helene Wermicheff, was born on April 30, 1898, in Tiflis in the Caucasus of Russia. She was educated in Switzerland and in 1920 went to Paris to study art. There she met and married George Pons, technical director of the Chauve Souris, a theater company organized by Soviet emigres.         The company traveled to England and, in 1922, to New York City, where Mrs. Pons and her husband established a studio for the design and execution of stage costumes in 1923. Mrs. Pons was in charge of the designs and Mr. Pons, who died in 1959, took care of the business side of the firm.         ''She has an intuition,'' Mr. Pons once said. ''I have accuracy, but she is an artist.''         Mrs. Pons, who spent the years after her retirement living in New York, California and Rome, entered the Rome clinic in August.         She is survived by a daughter, Giselle Marziale, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, all of whom live in Rome. Burial is to take place tomorrow at the Marzione family tomb in Verano Cemetery in Rome.         Correction:  April 24, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Friday about the costume designer Helene Pons misidentified the designer of the slip worn by Barbara Bel Geddes in the original 1955 production of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' It was Lucinda Ballard, not Mrs. Pons.       
        Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Lady Keith, known to her friends as Slim, had just completed her memoirs, ''Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life,'' which is to be published later this year by Simon & Schuster.         Known for her wit and charm, she was a sought-after guest, a close friend of Ernest Hemingway, the Selznicks and much of Hollywood and New York society. Truman Capote, who called her ''Big Mama,'' was one of her closest friends until he wrote ''Answered Prayers,'' an article that caricatured New York society. After the article was published in Esquire she never spoke to Mr. Capote again.         In her later years her circle of friends included Mike Nichols and Jerome Robbins.         Married Hawks and Hayward         A native of Salinas, Calif., she acquired her title from her third husband, Lord Kenneth Keith, a British merchant banker, whom she married in 1962.         She was Mary Raye Gross at her birth on July 15, 1916, but her mother changed her name to Nancy. She grew up to be the kind of beauty that was sought after in Hollywood, although she never appeared in films. In her early 20's she became a regular guest at San Simeon, the Hearst estate, and in 1941 Gary Cooper gave her away when she married Howard Hawks, the director and producer. Their daughter, Kitty Hawks, survives her.         In 1946, 150 fashion editors and stylists named ''Slim'' Hawks the best-dressed woman of the year. The runner-up was the Duchess of Windsor. At the time, Mrs. Hawks was quoted as saying, ''I have a tall, skinny frame that clothes look well on. Seriously, just say that I'm a great believer in simplicity in clothes.''         In her Hollywood years she was credited with discovering and promoting such stars as Lauren Bacall, Joanne Dru and Ella Raines, all of whom resembled her somewhat in their casual, long-limbed type of good looks.         Two days after she and Mr. Hawks were divorced in 1949, she married Leland Hayward, the movie and theatrical producer, at the Manhasset, L.I., estate of William S. Paley. She and Mr. Hayward divorced in 1959 and three years later she married Kenneth Keith. They were divorced in 1972. ''I was married to each for about 10 years,'' she said at the time. ''I guess that's about all I can hack.''         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Theodora Andersen, of Burlingame, Calif., and four stepchildren, Alastaire Keith and Camilla Mackesson, the children of Lord Keith, and William Hayward and Brooke Hayward Duchin.

        Lotte Jacobi, a fourth-generation photographer who fled Nazi Germany in 1935 and won fame with her sensitive portraits of scientists, statesmen and luminaries in the arts, died of pneumonia on Sunday in the Havenwood Nursing Home in Concord, N.H. She was 93 years old and lived in Deering, N.H.         Lotte Jacobi, a fourth-generation photographer who fled Nazi Germany in 1935 and won fame with her sensitive portraits of scientists, statesmen and luminaries in the arts, died of pneumonia on Sunday in the Havenwood Nursing Home in Concord, N.H. She was 93 years old and lived in Deering, N.H.         In 1979, when she was 83 and was being honored in an exhibition of 10 outstanding 20th-century female photographers, she told an interviewer: ''If it had come 20 years ago, I might have been able to appreciate it. Now it's a strain. I have too much else to do.''         Mrs. Jacobi made her portraits in Germany and the United States over six decades. Her subjects included Albert Einstein, Eleanor Roosevelt, the Soviet director Konstantin Stanislavsky, the theologian and philosopher Martin Buber, the actor and singer Paul Robeson, the poets Marianne Moore, W. H. Auden and Robert Frost, the cellist Pablo Casals, and the writers W. E. B. DuBois and Thomas Mann.         Miss Jacobi's portrait of the writer Theodore Dreiser is currently on exhibition at the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, which has several Jacobi portraits in its collection, as do other museums including the Museum of Modern Art in New York.         Fourth Generation in the Art         Though best known for her portraits, between 1946 and 1955 she made a notable series of photo abstractions called ''Photogenics,'' experiments with light and shadow. She also photographed street scenes in New York, nature scenes in New Hampshire, and people and landscapes in the Soviet Union, Central Asia and her native Germany.         Miss Jacobi was born in Thorn, West Prussia. Her great-grandfather, Samuel Jacobi, learned photography from Louis Daguerre, who gave his name to an early picture-making process. Her grandfather and father took up the camera in turn, and as a beginner she was encouraged to start out by making her own camera.         In Berlin she eventually specialized, photographing personalities in the arts, theater and dance. She moved to New York in 1935 and opened a studio with her sister, Ruth. She moved to Deering in 1955 and continued working actively through the 1970's. In 1981 she donated her archives, consisting of 47,000 negatives, to the University of New Hampshire.         She is survived by her sister, Ruth, who lives in a nursing home in Mission Viejo, Calif.

She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         She had been suffering from cancer, said her son, Timothy.         Known as Lois Moran throughout her career, she made her first film, in France, at the age of 14 and gained fame the next year when she starred with Ronald Colman in Samuel Goldwyn's ''Stella Dallas.''         In her film career of more than two dozen movies, Miss Moran combined an artist's versatility with romantic appeal. F. Scott Fitzgerald was said to have based the character Rosemary on her when he wrote ''Tender Is the Night.''         By the age of 20, she had already made four movies for Fox Studios, where she was under long-term contract. But she played leading roles for other studios as well, among them parts in ''Padlocked,'' ''Reckless Lady,'' ''The Road to Mandalay,'' ''Don't Marry,'' ''Mammy'' and ''The Men in Her Life.''         In the early 1930's, after studying singing, she moved to musicals, making her Broadway debut in ''This Is New York.'' She was the leading woman in George Kaufman's satire ''Of Thee I Sing'' and also starred for four years in ''Let 'Em Eat Cake.''         But in 1935, after marrying Col. Clarence M. Young, an Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Miss Moran slowed the pace of her career. She retired permanently in 1954 after co-starring with Robert Preston in the television series ''Waterfront.''         Miss Moran was born in Pittsburgh but, while still an infant, moved to Paris with her mother, a physician's widow. There she joined the Paris Opera Corps de Ballet, where she was spotted by a director who cast her in a movie.         She returned to the United States and starred as Belle Bennett's daughter in ''Stella Dallas.'' After that film's success, the offers poured in. She did one or two films at each of the major studios before signing her long-term contract with Fox.         For some time after her retirement, she and her husband lived and traveled throughout the country. But when Mr. Young retired as a vice president of Pan American World Airways more than 20 years ago, the couple moved permanently to Sedona.         Miss Moran's only immediate survivor is her son, who lives in Sedona.

Bertha Lindsay, the last surviving eldress of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming, known as the Shaker Society, died Wednesday at her home at Shaker Village in Canterbury, N.H. She was 93 years old.         She apparently died of a stroke, said Dr. Scott Swank, director of the village.         Sister Ethel Hudson, who is 94, is now the last of a community of Shakers in Canterbury that once numbered 400 men, women and children. The community, founded in 1792, was a communal society of shared property; followers were devoted to celibacy, living simply and pacifism. The Shakers in Canterbury once owned about 4,000 acres, most of which is being preserved. About 690 acres remain, and efforts are under way to have that too remain free of development.         There is one other Shaker community in the country, in Sabbathday Lake, Me. It has four covenanted members and four others who follow the Shaker practices.         History of Sect         The Shakers, who included free-form and choreographed dance in their worship, were an offshoot of the Shaking Quakers from England. They are thought to have derived their name from a belief that shaking from religious fervor was a manifestation of inner spiritual experience.         Miss Lindsay came to Canterbury in 1905 as an orphan. She lost her sight when she was 90 years old and put her remaining energies into making audio recordings about the history of the movement. ''I want people to know we did have fun and plenty of it,'' she said in an interview.         She is survived by a niece.

She was 103 years old. During a career as a volunteer that began in the early years of the century, she was active in many organizations, including the Welfare and Health Council, now the Community Council of Greater New York; the National Urban League and the American Red Cross.         On her 80th birthday in 1967, Mount Sinai was joined by the United Hospital Fund, the United Jewish Appeal, the New York Association for New Americans, the Play Schools Association, the New York City Y.W.C.A., the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and the Smith College Club of New York - all of which Mrs. Hirsch served for long periods as an officer, director, trustee or founder -in paying special tribute to her.         She contributed money as well as her time, benefiting institutions like Smith College, from which she graduated in 1907 at the age of 19; Northwestern University Law School, from which her father, Levy Mayer, graduated, and Princeton, where she endowed scholarships in memory of her husband, Walter A. Hirsch, a lawyer, who died in 1938, and their son, Lawrence, who died in 1960.         'I Do What I Can'         Mrs. Hirsch also worked on behalf of many political candidates and frequently wrote to legislators on issues about which she or her organizations were concerned.         Seven years ago, when she was 96 years old and still active as a Mount Sinai trustee, a post she assumed in 1932, Mrs. Hirsch was asked why she had worked so long as a volunteer.         ''I never know how I'm going to feel tomorrow,'' she said. ''But I do what I can when I can. This work is still very important to me.''         She was born in Chicago and came to New York to stay in 1909, when she married Mr. Hirsch. She spoke French, Italian and German, and the couple traveled extensively around the world.         Throughout her life Mrs. Hirsch had a flair for the unconventional. As an undergraduate at Smith, she managed to have her own horse and buggy by persuading a farmer to board the animal and keep her secret from the college authorities.         Honored by Smith College         At Smith, she was a member of the executive committee for many years. In 1968, she was awarded the Smith College Medal, given to those who ''exemplify in their lives and service to their community or to the college the true purpose of liberal arts education.''         In 1940, two years after her husband's death and in the year in which both her daughter and her son left home to marry, Mrs. Hirsch took a suite at the Pierre for six months, to give herself time to decide where to live permanently. She never moved, bought her suite when the Pierre went cooperative and at her death was the Pierre's longest-term resident.         She is survived by her daughter, Carol Kridel of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.

         Eve Arden, the caustic comedienne featured in dozens of films as a heroine's wry and wisecracking best friend, a warmhearted but sassy schoolteacher or secretary, died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The actress said she was born on April 30, 1912, but Ron Lisell, a spokesman for the family, said she was 83. Her death was caused by heart disease, Mr. Lisell said.         Miss Arden made her Broadway debut in the "Ziegfeld Follies" of 1934, but although she often appeared in plays in New York and on the road, she was chiefly a Hollywood actress. She was best known as the sardonic but likable English teacher in the radio and television series "Our Miss Brooks," which ran from 1948 until 1957. The series earned her an Emmy award as best actress for 1953.         The tall and languid Miss Brooks, noted for her exquisite comic timing and a knack for making the most of a throwaway line, received featured billing in more than 100 movies, including "Stage Door," "The Marx Brothers at the Circus," "No, No, Nanette," "Bedtime Story," "Cover Girl," "Anatomy of a Murder" and "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs." In 1945 she received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her performance in "Mildred Pierce."         The actress, whose original name was Eunice Quedens, was born in Mill Valley, Calif., near San Francisco. She was reared by her divorced mother and an aunt. Both encouraged her to act in school plays. At 16, she said, "I was dumped by my mother and aunt at the Henry Duffy office in San Francisco and told to get a job acting, which I did."         She joined the Duffy stock company, which performed in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and she later switched to the Bandbox Repertory Theater, which toured the "citrus circuit" in Southern California.         Miss Arden was a seasoned 21-year-old actress when she got a job in "Low and Behold," a forerunner of the "New Faces" revues produced by Leonard Sillman. The producer Lee Shubert saw a performance at the Pasadena Playhouse and offered Miss Arden a part as a showgirl in the 1934 "Ziegfeld Follies" on Broadway. And he told her to shed her real name.         Eunice Quedens did so by studying the labels of cosmetic jars on her dressing table and, she said, "stole my first name from Evening in Paris and the second from Elizabeth Arden."         Eve Arden won her first theatrical accolade in 1935 when she was featured with Jimmy Savo in "Parade."The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: "Count on the credit side Eve Arden's lorgnette humor which turns a song entitled 'Send for the Militia' into highly amusing satire." That and other reviews helped to win Miss Arden a featured role in the 1936 "Ziegfeld Follies." As Fannie Brice's understudy, she starred in several performances. Success, With the Help of a Cat         Miss Arden made her film debut in a 1937 grade-B melodrama called "Oh, Doctor," in which she disastrously played a gun moll. But her big break came that same year when the director Gregory La Cava cast her in what was to have been a small role in "Stage Door," starring Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers.         The actress built up her supposedly minor role with the aid of a slothful cat named Henry, which hung around the set. Having noticed that the sluggish Henry hardly ever moved, Miss Arden called Mr. La Cava's attention to the fact that the cat liked to sleep draped over her shoulders. The director was amused, and he included many shots of Miss Arden wearing the live cat as a fur piece. She was long remembered as the "girl with the cat."         In three years Miss Arden appeared in more than 20 films, becoming typecast in roles characterized by brittle, caustic humor. Trying to get away from that stereotype, she returned to Broadway and won praise for her featured roles in the Kern-Hammerstein musical "Very Warm for May" in 1939, the revue "Two for the Show" in 1940 and Cole Porter's "Let's Face It" in 1941, in which she appeared with Danny Kaye.         Miss Arden nearly stole the 1944 war movie "The Doughgirls" from three stars by enlivening her role as a tough-talking Russian guerrilla, punctuating her flines in ractured English lines with funny and risque gestures with her sniper's rifle.         Other featured roles followed, most of them putting Miss Arden back in what she considered the rut of the coldly tart-tongued and vitriolic cynic. It mattered not, she said, that audiences always responded to her with laughter; she did not like seeing herself in those roles, which were carried over into radio shows in which she starred with Jack Haley and Jack Carson.         "I just don't like that dame," she said in 1952. "She is hard-boiled, unsentimental and not me."         With "Our Miss Brooks," Miss Arden was able to alter her image, keeping the snappy, sardonic lines but giving the schoolteacher character a warmly affectionate and self-deprecating side.         That television series went off the air in 1957, and Miss Arden appeared in only an occasional film until 1967, when she began a two-season run co- starring with the comedienne Kaye Ballard in the NBC television show "The Mothers-in-Law." She also appeared as a school principal in the films "Grease" in 1978 and "Grease II" in 1982, and in "Under the Rainbow" in 1981.         Miss Arden's second husband, Brooks West, an actor, died in 1984.         Survivors include two daughters, Liza and Constance, and two sons, Douglas and Duncan.         Correction:  November 17, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Tuesday about the actress Eve Arden misstated the date of her film debut. It was in 1929, when she appeared under her original name, Eunice Quedens, in "The Song of Love"; it was not in 1937.       
         Lisa Kirk, a cabaret performer who won Broadway acclaim in the late 1940's singing "The Gentleman Is a Dope" in the musical "Allegro" and "Always True to You (In My Fashion)" in "Kiss Me, Kate," died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 62 years old and had homes in New York City and Malibu, Calif.         Miss Kirk died of lung cancer, said her husband, the lyricist and producer Robert Wells. He said she had known of her illness for only two weeks, after seeing doctors because of a slight cough and mild fatigue. "She had never been ill in her life," he said. "She didn't drink, and she didn't smoke. It's unbelievable."         In the late 1960's, Miss Kirk was injured in an autombile accident that threatened to end her career. But she started "training like a fighter," she recalled later. When she appeared in 1972 at the St. Regis Sheraton Hotel in New York City, John S. Wilson of The New York Times wrote that "she is dancing and singing as though nothing had ever happened." Inspired by Cole Porter         Miss Kirk said at the time: "I kept thinking of Cole Porter, who had both legs crushed in a riding accident 10 years before he wrote 'Kiss Me, Kate.' It was seeing his determination to get better that made me work so hard."         When Miss Kirk performed at Rainbow and Stars last year, Mr. Wilson praised her "warm, easy projection" and said, "Her long career has given her polish, presence and a solid foundation of songs by Rodgers and Hammerstein, Cole Porter and Jerry Herman with which she is associated."         Brought up in Roscoe, Pa., Miss Kirk studied at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. She appeared in New York nightclubs and on Broadway in "Good Night Ladies." But it was Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Allegro" that brought her fame in 1947. Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" the following year cemented her reputation.         Brooks Atkinson of The Times wrote, "Having startled the town last season by singing 'The Gentleman Is a Dope' as though she meant it, Miss Kirk is captivating it this year as a fully accredited hoyden with a sense of humor."         "Given a sardonic song like 'Always True to You (In My Fashion),' " he wrote, "she can translate it into pert and gleaming buffoonery."         Miss Kirk told an interviewer in 1956 that she had not realized at first that she had comic gifts. "I had the vague idea of becoming a new Helen Morgan," she recalled. "With that in mind, I practiced a song before a mirror and framed it in what I considered appropriate gestures. When I did it for a director and some backers of a show, those men fell off their seats laughing. I could see that the laugh wasn't ridicule. They were amused."         In 1964 she returned to Broadway, stepping into Meredith Willson's musical "Here's Love." In 1974 she appeared in "Mack and Mabel," a Broadway show with music and lyrics by Jerry Herman. She was in a 1984 revival of Noel Coward's "Design for Living" at the Circle in the Square theater and appeared in London last summer in Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant."         She is survived by her husband.         A funeral service is planned for Friday at 11:15 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, Madison Avenue and 81st Street.       
         Edith Schaffer Phillips, a former official of the American Broadcasting Company, died on Friday at her home in Lake Worth, Fla. She was 82 years old.         She had suffered from Parkinson's disease for more than three years, said her son, Jonathan, of Manhattan.         Mrs. Phillips was one of few women working in corporate law when she began her legal career, all of which was spent working for ABC and its predecessor, Paramount Pictures. Among her associates were Adolph Zucker, Charles deHilles and Stanton Griffith.         When Paramount Pictures lost its subsidiaries in antitrust actions, Mrs. Schaffer joined what was to become ABC. She was an officer of ABC, as well as an officer and director of several of its subsidiaries, including ABC Films, Paramount Records and Westminster Records. She retired in 1967.         She was a native New Yorker and a 1930 graduate of St. John's Law School.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her husband, D. John Phillips; a daughter, Lynn Raglione of Manhattan, and two brothers, Al and Irving, both of Sarasota. Fla.       
         Jo-Ann M. Cox, a partner in the New York accounting firm Ernst & Young, died at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 45 years old and also lived in Sea Bright, N.J.         Ms. Cox died of cancer, a sister, Cynthia Schmidl, said.         Ms. Cox was born in Newark and raised in Union, N.J., where she attended grammar and high schools. She received a bachelor's degree in accounting at Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1967 and later earned a master's degree in international finance from Pace University.         She joined Ernst & Young about 20 years ago and spent her entire career with the company, specializing in auditing. She became a partner in 1985. Ms. Cox was also a director of Inwood House, a home for unwed mothers in New York City.         Ms. Cox is survived by her mother, Olga Wagner, of Union, and two sisters, Sonia Wagner, of Brigantine, N.J., and Mrs. Schmidl, of Middletown, N.J.       
         Hortense W. Gabel, a former New York State Supreme Court justice who was a longtime advocate for housing and civil rights and whose career was shattered when she was accused in the Bess Myerson case, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         She died of heart failure, her daughter, Sukhreet, said.         Mrs. Gabel served on the Civil Court and State Supreme Court for 17 years. In December 1988 she was acquitted of charges that she had abused her powers by improperly reducing the alimony payments of Ms. Myerson's companion, Carl A. Capasso, in exchange for a job for her daughter in the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which Ms. Myerson headed.         Mrs. Gabel had a long and distinguished career in government before assuming the Civil Court bench in 1970. That career began after Mrs. Gabel, already active as a reform Democrat, attended a dinner party in 1948 given by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, the founder of the American Jewish Congress; discussion at the party centered on the formation of a group that would champion the cause of blacks discriminated against in housing.  Enforced Rent Laws         By the mid-1950's, as a director of the Committee on Discrimination in Housing, she was involved in trying to expose abuses in the urban renewal program in New York City and helped draft a report that was highly critical of Robert Moses, the builder who reshaped much of the city.         As head of New York City's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, she dreamed of a slumless New York, and her enforcement of the rent-control laws uncovered overcharges and conspiracies, saving tenants millions of dollars. She also developed rehabilitation programs for sections of Harlem, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.         Later, as a consultant to and vice president of the Center for Community Change, Mrs. Gabel helped develop housing programs in cities and states across the country.         In her several decades of public service, she served as an assistant New York City corporation counsel, general counsel and first deputy administrator of the New York State Temporary Housing Rent Commission and assistant to the mayor for housing and New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Commissioner, a position she held from 1962 to 1965. Mrs. Gabel was also a consultant to the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.         She served as an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1973 and as an acting Family Court judge in 1974. She was appointed to fill a vacancy on the State Supreme Court by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975. She was known as a compassionate judge who supported civil rights and women's causes. In 1986, she was named judge of the year by the National Association of Women Judges, an organization she helped found in 1979.         The organization's president, Justice Christine Durham of the Utah Supreme Court, said in a 1987 interview that Justice Gabel was revered as "one of the grand dames of the New York legal community, who has been a mentor and supporter of women in the profession for decades."         Justice Gabel resigned in 1987 under the cloud of criminal and misconduct investigations that led to the Myerson indictments.         A jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan found Mrs. Gabel, Ms. Myerson and Mr. Capasso not guilty of charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery. The central issue in the case was whether Mrs. Gabel, who was the judge handling preliminary motions in Mr. Capasso's divorce case in 1983, had received a bribe from Ms. Myerson, then New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, in the form of a job for Sukhreet Gabel as a special assistant to Ms. Myerson.         The hiring, the prosecution said, was an inducement to reduce Mr. Capasso's weekly support payments to his wife to $500 from $1,500. Mrs. Gabel had been seeking a job for her daughter. Family Drama         The case was full of bizarre twists and personal dramas. The two-month trial was dominated by the nine days of testimony against her mother by Sukhreet Gabel, the prosecution's star witness, who also taped two telephone conversations with her mother without her knowledge and provided prosecutors with some of her mother's documents.         Mrs. Gabel and her husband, Dr. Milton Gabel, were portrayed during the trial as the protective parents of a troubled woman, and seemed torn between wanting to support her in her moment in the spotlight and hoping that her testimony would not sway the jury.         After the verdict, an exuberant Mrs. Gabel held hands with her daughter outside the courthouse and shouted, "Hooray, we won!"         "This is the best judicial experience I have ever had," she said.         Hortense Wittstein Gabel, known as Horty to her friends, was born Dec. 16, 1912, in the Bronx. She attended public schools in the city and graduated from Hunter College in 1934. Three years later she graduated from Columbia University Law School and worked in her father's law firm. She left in 1944 to marry Dr. Gabel, then an army dentist, and in the war years was a reporter at Fort Hood, Tex., before returning to New York.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Sybil Phillips. They both live in Manhattan. Dr. Gabel died in July.       
         Joan Bennett, an actress who matured from a winsome blonde ingenue in movies of the 1930's to a sensuous brunette femme fatale in film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday evening at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 80 years old.         She died of cardiac arrest, said her daughter, Shelley Wanger.         Miss Bennett got her basic training playing opposite such major stars as Ronald Colman in "Bulldog Drummond" (her first important role, at the age of 19 in 1929), George Arliss in "Disraeli" (1929) and John Barrymore in "Moby Dick" (1930).         She portrayed a personable waitress trading wisecracks with Spencer Tracy in "Me and My Gal" (1932), a pert sister competing with Katharine Hepburn in "Little Women" (1933) and a psychiatrist's young wife slipping into insanity in "Private Worlds" (1935).         The leading mentor of Miss Bennett's career was a celebrated producer, Walter Wange. In 1938, two years before they were married, he made "Algiers," a major hit that introduced Hedy Lamarr to American audiences. Miss Lamarr's dark Viennese beauty captivated audiences around the country. Capitalizing on the sudden vogue, Mr. Wanger had Miss Bennett become a brunette for a scenic melodrama called "Trade Winds," and she began an entirely new career.         A Change of Personality         Combined with her sultry eyes and husky voice, the new look gave her an earthier, more arresting personality. She won praise in two 1940 melodramas -- "The House Across the Bay" and "The Man I Married" -- and came into her own in three film noir thrillers directed by Fritz Lang: as a Cockney prostitute in "Man Hunt" (1941), a mysterious model in "The Woman in the Window" (1944) and a vulgar blackmailer in "Scarlet Street" (1946).         She also won praise as a shrewish, cuckolding wife in Zoltan Korda's "Macomber Affair" (1947), as a deceitful wife in Jean Renoir's "Woman on the Beach" (1947) and as a tormented blackmail victim in Max Ophuls's "Reckless Moment" (1949).         Then, easily shifting images again, she was an elegant, witty and nurturing mother in two classic film comedies directed by Vincente Minnelli: "Father of the Bride" (1950) and "Father's Little Dividend" (1951), co-starring Spencer Tracy and Elizabeth Taylor.         Later in 1951, Miss Bennett was a principal in a major Hollywood scandal. Mr. Wanger shot and wounded her longtime agent, Jennings Lang, in a Los Angeles parking lot, accusing him of being a home wrecker. Miss Bennett later attributed her husband's outburst to desperation over large financial losses.         To avoid further notoriety, Mr. Wanger pleaded guilty to a reduced charge and served 100 days at a minimum-security prison farm. Mr. Lang soon recovered, but Miss Bennett's film career did not. Before the shooting, she had starred in more than 60 movies. After it, at the age of 41, she was offered only a handful of roles.         Bad Timing         In a 1981 interview, she contrasted the judgmental 1950's with the sensation-crazed 70's and 80's. "It would never happen that way today," she said, laughing. "If it happened today, I'd be a sensation. I'd be wanted by all studios for all pictures."         The Wangers divorced in 1965, after 25 years of marriage.         As movie offers dwindled, Miss Bennett turned to the stage and made successful national tours in such plays as "Susan and God," "Bell, Book and Candle," "Once More With Feeling," "The Pleasure of His Company" and "Never Too Late."         She also lent her presence and prestige to television's top gothic soap opera, "Dark Shadows," which ran from 1966 to 1971 and attracted a major cult following. The series, which also dealt with a guilt-ridden vampire (Jonathan Frid), has been frequently rebroadcast.         Associates invariably applauded Miss Bennett for professionalism and dedication. In her 1970 autobiography, "The Bennett Playbill," written with Lois Kibbee, she said her experience with "Dark Shadows," in which she played the mistress of a haunted mansion, had given her new regard for daytime television performers.         Miss Bennett was celebrated for not taking herself too seriously. In 1986, she remarked, "I don't think much of most of the films I made, but being a movie star was something I liked very much."         Theatrical Lineage         Joan Bennett was born on Feb. 27, 1910, in Palisades, N.J. Her parents were Richard Bennett, a flamboyant matinee idol, and Adrienne Morrison, an actress whose lineage went back five generations to strolling players in 18th-century England. The couple's elder daughters, Constance and Barbara, also became actresses.         Miss Bennett attended St. Margaret's, a boarding school in Waterbury, Conn., and L'Hermitage, a finishing school in Versailles, France. At the age of 16, she married John Marion Fox, whom she later described as a playboy and drunkard. At 17, she had a daughter, Diana, and at 18, she divorced Mr. Fox.         That same year, her father got her the ingenue role in a Broadway melodrama, "Jarnegan," in which he starred as a lecherous, brawling movie director. She received good notices, and after a five-month run, he helped her get her first movie contract. She soon succeeded in "Bulldog Drummond" and over the next decade starred in 33 films. Her major early setback was a final-round loss of the role of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh.         About Hollywood in the 1930's, Miss Bennett recalled: "The industry held a combination of nuts, talents, charlatans and geniuses, all of whom were learning, bumbling and creating with fury and innocence. The colorful types had a passionate love for the business, not just for the money. Today, it seems to me, it's strictly a big business, based on dollars and cents."         Miss Bennett is survived by her fourth husband, David Wilde, a former critic and publisher whom she married in 1973; four daughters, Diana Anderson of Los Angeles and Melinda Bena of Chappaqua, N.Y., from her second marriage to Gene Markey, a film writer-producer whom she married in 1932 and divorced in 1937, and Stephanie Guest and Shelley Wanger, both of Manhattan, from her marriage to Mr. Wanger, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Miriam Stern, an agent for songwriters and a former executive director of the American Guild of Authors and Composers, died on Sunday at Doctors Hospital. She was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pancreatic cancer, said Lynnae Crawford, of the Songwriters Guild of America.         When Miss Stern resigned in 1969 as executive director of the American Guild of Authors and Composers, now known as the Songwriters Guild of America, she had been associated with the organization for 22 years.         Before joining the guild, Ms. Stern worked for six years as road manager for the band leader Sammy Kaye.         In the summer of 1970, Miss Stern formed a corporation to represent estates of composers whose reversionary rights had been disregarded by the British Music Publishers Association. The test actions she organized resulted in a decision by the House of Lords to establish such rights as stated in a 1911 statute that she was instrumental in uncovering.         Miss Stern is survived by a niece, Susan Klein.       
         Eugenia Delarova Doll, a ballerina with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo and a dance and music patron, died on Thursday at New York Hospital. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Doll died of complications following surgery for a brain tumor, said Robert Fizdale, the pianist, who was a longtime friend.         Mrs. Doll, born in St. Petersburg, left the Soviet Union in 1926. The next year she performed in Paris with the Folies-Bergere, where she met Leonide Massine, the choreographer and dancer, at the stage door and soon after became his second wife. The Massines moved to New York City in 1928 and danced at the Roxy Theater until 1931.         Mrs. Doll joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1933, dancing as Eugenia Delarova. She originated character roles in several ballets choreographed by Massine, then ballet master and a choreographer and dancer with the company. Among the roles were the Flower Girl in "Gaite Parisienne."  Opened a Flower Shop         The couple were divorced in 1938. Mrs. Doll opened a flower shop on Madison Avenue and appeared on Broadway as a dancer and actress in shows like "Simple Simon" and "The Lady Comes Across." She married Henri G. Doll, an industrialist, inventor and director of research and development at Schlumberger Ltd. Their house on East 78th Street became a second home for musicians and dancers from all over the world, particularly Russian emigres, who were befriended and helped by the Dolls.         Mrs. Doll was an enthusiastic balletgoer, who recommended to Massine that he hire "a fantastic dancer" named Jerome Robbins "to do all his parts," as she later put it. Mr. and Mrs. Doll later commissioned Mr. Robbins's "Other Dances."         This year, Mrs. Doll gave a total of $3 million to American Ballet Theater, the New York City Ballet, the School of American Ballet and the American Friends of the Paris Opera and Ballet. Mrs. Doll also contributed to the Dance Theater of Harlem, the Joffrey Ballet and the companies of Paul Taylor and Alvin Ailey, as well as the American Symphony Orchestra, Carnegie Hall, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and the French Institute/Alliance Francaise. In 1986 she was named an Officier de L'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the French Government for her support of the Paris Opera Ballet.         Mrs. Doll is survived by her husband.       
         Marjorie Montrose Christiansen, a college administrator, died on Friday at Springmoor Health Center in Raleigh, N.C. She was 65 years old and lived in Chapel Hill, N.C.         She died of cancer of the lung and brain, her husband, Elliot, said.         Mrs. Christiansen served as acting dean of studies at Fordham from 1968 to 1971 after being assistant to the dean of students at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y. She was director of the University of North Carolina's fellows program for eight years before retiring in 1988. She was a past president of the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a sister, Jean Kullander of Savannah, Ga; two daughters, Catherine Hollenberg of Clarks Summit, Pa., and Laura Morse of Wellesley, Mass, and three grandchildren.       
         Mila P. Conanan, the director of operating rooms at the Allen Pavilion of the Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center, died on Thursday at Holy Name Hospital in Teaneck, N.J.

         Anne Revere, an actress who won acclaim for her screen portrayals of wise, protective motherly characters until her career was cut short by the 1950's Communist blacklist, died yesterday at her home in Locust Valley, L.I. She was 87 years old.         She died of pneumonia, Dr. Howard B. Gotlieb, the director of collections and curator of her archives at Boston University, said.         The stately, spirited character actress won a 1945 Academy Award as the mother of Elizabeth Taylor in "National Velvet." Miss Revere was also nominated for supporting Oscars for playing the mothers of Jennifer Jones in "The Song of Bernadette" (1943) and of Gregory Peck in "Gentleman's Agreement" (1947).         Miss Revere was also the understanding mother of John Garfield in "Body and Soul" (1947) and of Montgomery Clift in "A Place in the Sun" (1951). Her salt-of-the-earth motif was her straight hair carefully combed into a practical bun.         From 1934 to 1951, she was much in demand, appearing in nearly three dozen films, including "The Howards of Virginia," "Old Acquaintance," "The Keys of the Kingdom," "Fallen Angel," "Dragonwyck" and "Forever Amber." But then she was blacklisted by the industry and barred from films for 20 years for refusing to testify about Communist links before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         The actress voluntarily resigned from the board of the Screen Actors Guild in 1951 because she believed her silence on Capitol Hill had barred her from making further films.  Back to the Stage         "Nobody went to jail because they were Communists," she said in an interview in 1975. "They went to jail for contempt. But the awful thing about the whole bloody era was that whether you answered or didn't, cooperated or not, you were dead in the business."         Miss Revere left Hollywood to seek roles on the stage, where she had trained, and starred in regional theaters and stock and occasionally on Broadway. She won a 1960 Tony Award for portraying a rigid spinster opposite Maureen Stapleton and Jason Robards in Lillian Hellman's drama "Toys in the Attic."         Anne Revere was born in Manhattan on June 25, 1903. Her father, Clinton, was a stockbroker, and she grew up on the Upper West Side and in Westfield, N.J. She earned a Bachelor of Arts at Wellesley College in 1926 and studied at the American Laboratory School in New York City with Maria Ouspenskaya and Richard Boleslavsky.         Miss Revere honed her craft in stock and regional theaters. Her first Broadway triumph was in Lillian Hellman's first play, the 1934 drama "The Children's Hour," as one of two ill-fated teachers at a girls' school falsely accused of lesbianism. The long-running play led to other leading stage roles and her Hollywood contract.         Samuel Rosen, a stage director who was Miss Revere's husband of 49 years, died in 1984. She is survived by a sister, Winn Revere Smith, of Cross River, L.I.
