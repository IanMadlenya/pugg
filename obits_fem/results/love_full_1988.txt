Martha Love McCagg Snow, an architect, died of colon and stomach cancer Wednesday at her daughter's home in Edison, N.J. She was 83 years old and lived in Bronxville, N.Y.         Mrs. Snow designed hospitals in Brooklyn, Georgia and North Carolina, as well as houses in the Northeast.         She is survived by her husband, Richard; a daughter, Dr. Caroline O. McCagg of Edison; a son, Edward K. McCagg of Seattle; two sisters, Dorothy Love Saunders of Bryn Mawr, Pa., and Mary Love Glenn of Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., and three grandchildren.       
        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until the time of her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting women of her time. Mystery in Sculpture         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev, Russia, in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in Russia until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest.         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Isaac Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise Nevelson was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland, Me., asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she was married to Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. A Variety of Influences         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left.         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him that she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture As Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious internal surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date. By JOHN RUSSELL         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan.

A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.

She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left. Such was her compulsion to work hard and move on that she seemed to be reliving in microcosm the trauma of enforced migration that was endured by hundreds of thousands of European refugees in the 1930's and was shortly to be experienced by even greater numbers of people.         Mrs. Nevelson felt such things in her whole body, as a great dancer feels them; and with her well-developed sense of theater and her first-hand experience of the film studio, where whole environments are no sooner built than they are dismantled, she gradually felt her way toward the work for which she eventually became famous. Celine Was a Suitor         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism.

Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.       
        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known artists, died Sunday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known artists, died Sunday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting people of her time. Known for Wall Sculptures         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev in the Ukraine in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in the Ukraine until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest. A Feeling For Wood         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Mr. Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she married Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. Constant Change, Constant Work         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left. Such was her compulsion to work hard and move on that she seemed to be reliving in microcosm the trauma of enforced migration that was endured by hundreds of thousands of European refugees in the 1930's, and shortly to be experienced by even greater numbers of people.         Mrs. Nevelson felt such things in her whole body, as a great dancer feels them; and with her well-developed sense of theater and her first-hand experience of the film studio, where whole environments are no sooner built than they are dismantled, she gradually felt her way toward the work for which she eventually became famous. Celine Was a Suitor         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she later said of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built an Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition, not just a ''show,'' but a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture as Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.

In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture.

Mara Lynn Conrad, a dancer in Broadway musicals, movies and television, died of liver cancer on April 6 in Freeport, the Bahamas. She was 59 years old.         Mrs. Conrad's career as a dancer spanned nearly 40 years, including television appearances on the Ed Sullivan, Groucho Marx and Milton Berle shows during the 1950's and 1960's. She performed in ''Stop the World,'' ''New Girl in Town'' and about two dozen other Broadway musicals, road shows and revivals. Her film credits included roles in ''Let's Make Love'' and ''Last Train From Gun Hill.''         Mrs. Conrad is survived by her husband, Harold, and a son, Casey, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Robert Mosier, of Sebring, Fla.       
        Eva Novak, an actress who starred as Tom Mix's love interest in 10 of his westerns and did her own stunts as well, died of pneumonia on Sunday at the Motion Picture Country Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 90 years old.         Eva Novak, an actress who starred as Tom Mix's love interest in 10 of his westerns and did her own stunts as well, died of pneumonia on Sunday at the Motion Picture Country Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 90 years old.         Miss Novak, who was born in St. Louis, came to Hollywood as a teen-ager. She worked in slapstick comedies and was a bathing beauty for Mack Sennett. Among her films as leading lady for Tom Mix were ''Sky High'' and ''Trailin'.'' She also was the leading lady in three films for William S. Hart.         In 1921 she married William Reed, a director and stuntman, and the couple went to Australia in the late 1920's to make a series of westerns there.         She returned to the United States in the 1930's and appeared in a number of films directed by John Ford, an old friend, who cast her in such classics as ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' ''Stagecoach'' and ''Fort Apache.'' She also played a nun in ''The Bells of St. Mary's.''         Miss Novak is survived by her sister, Jane, 2 daughters, 10 grandchildren, and 15 great-grandchildren.       
        Mildred Gillars, known during World War II as Axis Sally for her propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany, has died. She was 87.         Mildred Gillars, known during World War II as Axis Sally for her propaganda broadcasts for Nazi Germany, has died. She was 87.         Ms. Gillars, who died Saturday, had moved here after her release in 1961 from Federal prison, where she served 12 years after her conviction for treason.         In her trial in 1949, Ms. Gillars said she was born in Portland, Me., in 1900. She said she attended Ohio Wesleyan University but left before graduating and traveled to Germany, where she took a radio job in 1940.         ''Hello, gang,'' her broadcasts to Allied forces began. ''Throw down those little old guns and toddle off home. There's no getting the Germans down.''         After the war, American military officials found her living in cellars of bombed-out buildings in Berlin. She was returned to the United States in 1948 and charged with treason.         Ms. Gillars testified that she had fallen in love with a German Foreign Service officer who talked her into making the broadcasts.         She was convicted and sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison. She served 12 years at Alderson, W.Va. After her release, she moved to Columbus and taught music at a kindergarten.         There was no announcement of her death. A private funeral was held, said her attorney, James Sauer.         He knew of no surviving relatives.       
        Mildred E.

She was 87 years old and lived in Columbus.         Mildred E. Gillars, nicknamed Axis Sally by American soldiers in World War II for her Nazi propaganda radio broadcasts, died of cancer of the colon last Saturday at Grant Medical Center in Columbus, Ohio. She was 87 years old and lived in Columbus.         An American living in Berlin, she broadcast programs in English to the Allied forces in Europe and North Africa, messages designed to heighten loneliness, fatigue and the futility of fighting Germany. After the war she was arrested and brought to the United States, where she was tried and imprisoned for treason.         Her trial in 1949 attracted enormous public attention, as much for the soap-opera quality of Miss Gillars's life as for her crime.         She was sentenced to 10 to 30 years in prison and was fined $10,000. After serving 12 years, she was released on parole from the Federal Reformatory for Women in Alderson, W.Va. She then taught music in the convent school of the Sisters of the Poor Child Jesus in Columbus. Release From Prison         Miss Gillars was born Mildred Elizabeth Sisk in Portland, Me., but she changed her name. She attended Ohio Wesleyan University from 1918 to 1922. After her release from prison, she returned to the university and graduated in 1973 with a bachelor's degree in speech.         Conflicting reports about her life abroad say that she studied piano in Dresden, modeled in Paris and was a dressmaker's assistant in Algiers and an English teacher in Berlin. She arrived in Berlin in 1934 and broadcast in English on the German radio before the war. Arrest in 1946         When she was arrested in 1946, Miss Gillars said she had moved to Germany to marry a German citizen, who later died. The man was Max Otto Koischwitz, a former professor at Hunter College in New York who was an official in the German Foreign Office.         At her trial, Miss Gillars fascinated the public and the press with her flamboyance and cool self-possession. She cut a theatrical figure in tight-fitting black dresses, long silver hair and a deep tan. She had scarlet lips and nails. Miss Gillars ''has the hair of Mother machree and she wears it in the manner of Rita Hayworth,'' Richard H. Rovere wrote in The New Yorker of Feb. 26, 1949.         She sent a frisson through the trial when she described her obsessive love affair with Mr. Koischwitz, who was married. The program she was convicted of participating in, ''Vision of Invasion,'' was written by her lover. It was broadcast on May 11, 1944, only weeks before the June 6 invasion of Normandy. Mr. Koischwitz was reported to have died in the Soviet capture of Berlin in the spring of 1945.         After the war, Miss Gillars was found roaming, hungry and homeless, near Frankfurt am Main, seeking to regain her American citizenship. At her trial, she was said to have renounced American citizenship while living in Germany and American officials reported that in 1941 she had refused repatriation.         In 1950, a Federal appeals court upheld her conviction. It noted in its ruling that she had received the highest salary of all broadcasters on German radio.         After prison, her life in Columbus was quiet and reclusive. She had an unlisted telephone number and her records at Ohio Wesleyan are sealed. She is survived by at least one half-sister, who asked not to be identified.       
        Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Berlin, the last of whose four novels, ''The Best of Families,'' was published in 1970, was also a prolific short-story writer and contributed several articles to The New Yorker before her marriage to Mr. Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926. Mr. Berlin observed his 100th birthday last May 11.         Their marriage was one of the most sensational social events of the 1920's, for it united the famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, with the former Ellin Mackay, a Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's fortune for love.         The Municipal Court wedding came after several events that made it clear that Ellin Mackay, one of the great beauties of her time, was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill society heiress.         She had all but turned her back on the exclusive so-called 400, which ruled her mother's day, choosing the new ''cafe society.'' She said she preferred the ''dizzy twenties'' to the ''dull old days'' when she was one of New York's most celebrated debutantes. Abandoning 'Polite Society'         Miss Mackay wrote what her friends called her ''saucy but amusing'' opinions in articles for The New Yorker. In one article she defended her generation's abandonment of the Junior League and ''polite society'' for the gayer life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.         ''It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ''They go to find privacy.''         That article shocked society and newspaper editorial writers, as did one that followed in The New Yorker dated Dec. 25, 1925, titled ''The Declining Function,'' in which she explained how, as a liberated young woman, she intended to seek her joys as she liked.         More portentous was her statement, ''Modern girls are conscious of their identity and they marry whom they choose, satisfied to satisfy themselves.'' Less than a month later she married the widowed Mr. Berlin, who was 15 years her senior and an immigrant Russian whose fame as a songwriter failed to impress the Mackay social circle.         The marriage so infuriated her father, Clarence Mackay, whose fortune was based in the Postal Telegragh Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, mining and several other inherited interests, that he barred her from his home and threatened to disinherit her. They were not reconciled until five years later. Marriage of 62 Years         The marriage, during which Mr. Berlin wrote several songs just for her, including ''Always'' and ''The Song Is Ended,'' was a true love match and was to last 62 years.         Ellin Mackay was born March 22, 1903, on her father's $6 million estate in Roslyn, L.I. Her mother was the former Katherine Duer, a successful writer. An aunt, Alice Duer Miller, was to become the author of the long, popular World War II poem ''The White Cliffs of Dover.''         She was also a granddaughter of John W. Mackay, an Irish immigrant and one of the Nevada pioneers who made fortunes from the Comstock Lode. He parlayed his fortune into diversified business interests that made him a billionaire.         Miss Mackay was educated in private schools and took special courses at Barnard College. She was a debutante during the season of 1922-23, when her father gave her a ball at the Ritz-Carlton.         Mr. Mackay, who had been divorced in 1913, doted on little Ellin, and he took her on several trans-Atlantic crossings. Because of their close relationship, he was all the more unwilling to give his blessing to the ''unsuitable'' Mr. Berlin.  In the first few years of her marriage, Mrs. Berlin put aside her budding writing career to have a family. Their only son, Irving Berlin Jr., died in infancy, and they had three daughters. Short Stories and Novels         In 1933 she began contributing short stories to The Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal and other popular magazines. Her first novel, ''Land I Have Chosen,'' was published in 1944. Depicting the evils of Nazi Germany, the novel was sold to the movies for $150,000, then a record. Her other novels were ''Lace Curtain,'' 1948; ''Silver Platter,'' a 1957 semifictional account of her Nevada pioneer forebears, and ''The Best of Families.''         Mrs. Berlin was re-baptized in the Catholic faith in the 1930's, and throughout her life she worshiped at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where a funeral will be held at 2 P.M. Tuesday. She was a major supporter of the Girl Scout movement.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Berlin is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett, of New York; Linda Louise Emmett, of Paris, and Elizabeth Irving Peters, of New York; a brother, John W. Mackay, of Locust Valley, L.I.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
        Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died today, relatives said. She was 78 years old.         Barbara Woodhouse, the dog trainer whose teaching methods and kindly manner made her an international celebrity, died today, relatives said. She was 78 years old.         Her family said she died in a hospital in Buckinghamshire, northwest of London, having suffered a second stroke a month ago. She had a first stroke in 1984.         ''We shall miss her very much but she had been very ill for some time,'' Mrs. Woodhouse's son, Patrick, said today.         In the 1970's and early 1980's, millions of dog owners in Britain and the United States watched Mrs. Woodhouse schooling pets on the BBC television program ''Training Dogs the Woodhouse Way,'' which became widely syndicated in this country. Before long, loyal viewers were telling their dogs, ''Walkies!'' as her byword caught on. With Love and Breath         Her book, ''No Bad Dogs, The Woodhouse Way,'' was a bestseller in 1982.         She insisted that any dog could be trained and showed that they could be taught within minutes with ''tone of voice, telepathy and a little bit of loving.'' Her way of getting to know an animal was to breathe into its nose.         Mrs. Woodhouse's smiling, bespectacled face, framed by short gray hair, became a familiar sight on television talk shows. In 1980, she was ''flabbergasted'' to be named female television personality of the year in Britain.         ''She had an amazing ability with animals,'' her husband, Dr. Michael Woodhouse, said.         The Woodhouses lived in Croxley Green in Hertfordshire north of London.         The daughter of a clergyman, Mrs. Woodhouse developed her knack with animals as a child when her mother boarded dogs. She learned she could stop their barking by talking to them in a quiet voice. Innkeeper for Man and Beast         She trained dogs as her three children were growing up, and at one time ran a hotel for dogs and their owners.         She made her first dog-training film, ''Love Me, Love My Dog,'' in 1955 using a Great Dane, Juno. It was shown in movie theaters around the country. Her first record album, in 1967, had advance sales of 25,000.         Mrs. Woodhouse said she received 400 letters a day when the television program was running.         She once said that because of the television appearances, she could not go out in public without being asked for her advice.         The public recognition could be helpful, she said. Once, going through passport control at a London airport, the inspector said: ''Oh, here's the dog lady. No need to see your passport. Walkies!''       
        Bonita Granville Wrather, a child film star of the 1930's and a longtime executive in the Wrather Corporation, a complex of oil, entertainment and real estate businesses founded by her husband, Jack Wrather, died of cancer yesterday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 65 years old and had homes in Holmby Hills, Calif., and         Bonita Granville Wrather, a child film star of the 1930's and a longtime executive in the Wrather Corporation, a complex of oil, entertainment and real estate businesses founded by her husband, Jack Wrather, died of cancer yesterday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 65 years old and had homes in Holmby Hills, Calif., and London.         As Bonita Granville, the actress was the epitome of malevolent little girls, particularly in ''These Three,'' Lillian Hellman's heterosexual film adaptation of her play about lebsianism, ''The Children's Hour.'' The performance won the actress a 1936 Oscar nomination.         Among her more than 50 other movies were ''Ah, Wilderness!'' (1935), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Maid of Salem'' (1937), ''Quality Street'' (1937), ''Now Voyager'' (1942) and ''Hitler's Children'' (1943). The spunky blond actress also played the inquisitive title role in the ''Nancy Drew'' detective-reporter series. A Family of Entertainers         She was born in Manhattan on Feb. 2, 1923, into a family of entertainers and went on the stage at 3. She became a leading lady in films of the late 40's and retired from the screen in 1947 to marry Mr. Wrather. She appeared occasionally in television plays and, in 1958, became the associate producer of her husband's popular ''Lassie'' television series and later its producer.         Mr. Wrather was a founding member of the ''kitchen cabinet'' of prominent Californians who encouraged Ronald Reagan to run for Governor in 1967, and he and his wife were close friends of the Reagans. In a statment by the White House yesterday, the President and his wife lauded Mrs. Wrather as ''a warm and caring friend'' who had for so many years ''enriched our lives with her sparkling personality, her wonderful sense of humor, her loyalty and her love.''         Mrs. Wrather held a series of major executive posts in the Wrather Corporation and succeeded her husband as board chairman after his death in 1984, holding the post until last January, when the company was sold to the Walt Disney Company and Industrial Equity (Pacific) Limited, a Hong Kong investment concern. Civic Appointments         Mrs. Wrather was the chairman of the American Film Institute, a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center and of Loyola Marymount University, a director and former president of the Los Angeles Orphanage Guild, a member of the advisory committee of the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles, a founder and board member of the Los Angeles Music Center and a board member of the Women's Council of the Public Broadcasting Service's Channel 28 there.         For her work on the ''Lassie'' television series and for talks around the country in behalf of environmental conservation, Mrs. Wrather received a Boy Scouts of America National Award and a National 4-H Congress Conservation Award.         Surviving are two daugthers, Molly Dolle and Linda Finocchiaro; a son, Christopher, and nine grandchildren, all of the Los Angeles area.       
        When asked, after a trip to Egypt, how she liked the pyramids, the sculptor Louise Nevelson replied, ''Too small.'' The response, said the art dealer Arnold Glimcher, typified her sense of ''grandeur,'' her ''great expectations'' for herself and everyone around her.         When asked, after a trip to Egypt, how she liked the pyramids, the sculptor Louise Nevelson replied, ''Too small.'' The response, said the art dealer Arnold Glimcher, typified her sense of ''grandeur,'' her ''great expectations'' for herself and everyone around her.         Mr. Glimcher's anecdote was one of many wonderful stories told about the irreverent and irrepressible sculptor at a memorial service held yesterday in the Medieval Court of the Metropolitan Museum. Mrs. Nevelson died at her home in SoHo on April 17 at the age of 88.         Among the more than 250 people who attended were stellar figures from the worlds of art, fashion and the movies. They included the artists Jasper Johns, Marisol, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal and Saul Steinberg; the art dealer Leo Castelli; the actress Sigourney Weaver; the musician John Cage; the couturier Arnold Scaasi; the photographer Arnold Newman, and the museum directors Philippe de Montebello, Richard Oldenburg and Robert Buck, along with William Luers, the Metropolitan's president. Also in attendance were Mrs. Nevelson's son, Mike Nevelson; her sister-in-law, Lillian Berliawsky, and her longtime assistant, Diana McKown. Between tributes spoken by friends, a quintet played music by Beethoven, Mozart and Ludwig Thuille, a 19th-century German composer. Rearranging 'Mountain Woman'         At the gathering, William Lieberman, director of the department of 20th-century art at the Met, described Mrs. Nevelson as ''a great artist, a wonderful woman, an elegant lady and a good and generous friend.''         Mr. Glimcher, Mrs. Nevelson's dealer for many years, drew laughter from the guests by telling of her reluctance to exhibit ''Mountain Woman'' -an early work that she had always disliked - in her 1967 retrospective at the Whitney Museum. As the curator kept insisting on it, ''she was more and more unhappy,'' he said.         Shortly before the show opened, Mrs. Nevelson requested that Mr. Glimcher help her ''rearrange'' it. ''She asked us to carry 'Mountain Woman' across the room, and at midpoint she said, ''Drop it,'' Mr. Glimcher recalled. ''We did, and the work was 'rearranged' to her satisfaction, in a thousand pieces.'' A Telegram at Yaddo         Hilton Kramer, editor of The New Criterion, a magazine of the arts, told of writing one of the earliest reviews of Mrs. Nevelson's work in the mid-1950's. It was the first in her long series of sculptural environments known as ''walls.'' He said that later, at Yaddo, the writers' retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., he was summoned to the telephone by Western Union with a telegram from Mrs. Nevelson. ''The telegram read, 'I love you,' '' Mr. Kramer recalled.         Despite her later success, he went on to say, Mrs. Nevelson ''remained extraordinarily independent of her reputation and other people's reputations.'' And he cited her belief that ''you can be anything you want to be'' as ''the key to her artistic ambitions, her esthetic audacity and the personal freedom she achieved as woman as well as artist.''         Barbaralee Diamonstein, a member of the New York City Landmarks Commission, a writer on art and architecture and a longtime friend of Mrs. Nevelson, described the sculptor -known for her theatrical garb and personality almost as much as for her art - as ''all collage:her work, her conversation, her ensembles.''         ''A complex cross between a princess and a peasant, an egalitarian with some surprisingly elitist concerns,'' she said, ''Louise was a living assemblage who accurately mirrored her startling and stunning constructions.'' 'I Always Knew I Was Great'         Speaking also of Mrs. Nevelson's belief in herself as a vital factor in her work, Miss Diamonstein recalled once asking her how she had survived during her many years of obscurity before success. ''I always knew I was great,'' Mrs. Nevelson replied. The short program was ended by the playwright Edward Albee, who said Mrs. Nevelson had understood ''perhaps better than any artist I've known, that she was her art.'' And he told of interviewing the sculptor with a tape recorder for an article he was writing. ''She said she didn't mind,'' he said. ''I tested it out and it worked well. Then, when I actually put it on the table, she said 'What's that?' She passed her hand over it a few times. I asked the important questions. When I got home, my tape recorder was blank. It was simply that Louise was a wizard and those of us who knew her, knew her work, we knew she was a wizard, did we not?''       
        Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Miss Graham, who also served as a war correspondent in Europe in World War II and who at various times had her own Hollywood-based radio and television shows, is probably best remembered for her love affair with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose last unhappy years she described in her first book, ''Beloved Infidel,'' published in 1958.         That book concentrated on the Pygmalion and Galatea aspect of the relationship between the novelist and Miss Graham, in which he created a ''college of one'' for her, drawing up lists of books she read to complete ''the education of a woman,'' as her book was subtitled. 'The Very Best Portrait'         ''Beloved Infidel,'' which Miss Graham wrote in collaboration with Gerold Frank, became an international best seller, received critical approval for its warmth and authenticity, and was hailed by Edmund Wilson in a long review in The New Yorker as ''the very best portrait of Fitzgerald that has yet been put into print.''         Born into poverty in an East London slum, Miss Graham parlayed a native intelligence and her great good looks, under the guidance of several worldly and cultivated men, into a reputation as a bright, brittle and often witty sophisticate.         She labored under no illusions, however, and late in life characterized herself as ''a fascinating fake who pulled the wool over Hollywood's eyes.'' She was also not above turning her talent for abrasive criticism of ''the lightweight pinheads of Hollywood'' upon herself.         For example, in ''The Rest of the Story,'' published in 1964, she wrote: ''Sitting at my typewriter, banging out the items, I sometimes laugh as I stir my witch's brew, putting in the onions and the herbs to give indigestion to people I don't like or to those I think have slighted me, the great me. And it's true that I sometimes mistake my typewriter for my teeth, because the more I bite the more my column will be read.'' A Hard Childhood         Miss Graham's real name was Lily Shiel, which ''to this day horrifies me to a degree impossible to explain,'' she wrote in ''Beloved Infidel.'' When she was an infant, she said, her father died of tuberculosis, and her childhood was characterized by a string of Dickensian hardships. For six years she lived with her mother, a domestic, in a rented basement room, then wound up in an orphanage. As a young woman, she put in a brief stint as a domestic, which she hated, and then went to work in Gamage's department store as a toothbrush demonstrator. Miss Graham said she got the job because she was pretty and had a dazzling smile and perfect teeth, ''thanks to a sweets-deprived childhood in the orphanage.''         At Gamage's she met her first Pygmalion, Maj. John Graham Gillam, who employed her in the iron and steel company in which he was an executive, taught her table manners and coached her to free herself of her Cockney accent. After their marriage, she adopted the name of Sheilah Graham, studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and finally was hired as a chorus girl by C. B. Cochran, the British equivalent of Florenz Zeigfeld, who put her in a 1927 musical revue called ''One Dam Thing After Another.'' When the star fell ill, Miss Graham went on in her place, and, of course, was a smashing success, she said.         Cochran signed her to a contract for other shows and she soon began selling articles about show business to the penny press. She recognized that as a writer she possessed a quality of ''salable mediocrity,'' she said, and decided to carve out a career in journalism. At Home in Hollywood         In 1933, Miss Graham said, she moved to New York and for two years wrote for The New York Mirror and The Evening Journal. In 1935 she was offered North American Newspaper Alliance's syndicated Hollywood column, and she moved to Los Angeles. She divorced Major Gillam in 1937.  She felt at home in Hollywood, more so than she had in New York, she said, because ''Hollywood was notorious even in London for the ignorance of the people who made the films - no one could embarrass me with erudite conversation.''         It was in July 1937, at a party given for her by Robert Benchley to celebrate her engagement to the Marquess of Donegall, that she met Fitzgerald. It was love at first sight for both of them, she said. She broke off her angagement and entered into an affair with Fitzgerald that was to last more than three years, until Dec. 21, 1940, when he died in her arms.         The years with Fitzgerald were, for Miss Graham, both idyllic and harrowing. The famed novelist was in failing health, fighting an epic and losing battle with alcoholism. He looked upon himself as a burned-out case, and he was having trouble turning out movie scripts to pay for his daughter's education and his wife Zelda's mental asylum bills.         But they were devoted to one another and Miss Graham gave him not only her love and patience but also a measure of peace of mind. She served as the model for Kathleen, the heroine in ''The Last Tycoon,'' the Fitzgerald novel that was unfinished at his death.         ''I was never a mistress,'' Miss Graham said. ''I was a woman who loved Scott Fitzgerald for better or worse until he died.'' War Correspondent in England         After his death Miss Graham returned to England as a war correspondent. It was there that she met, and married in 1941, Trevor Cresswell Lawrence Westbrook, an executive of the company that manufactured the Spitfire fighter plane. Before the marriage ended in divorce in 1946, they had two children, Wendy and Robert. A brief third marriage, in 1953, to a man she identified only as ''an American of Polish ancestry with an unpronounceable name,'' also ended in divorce.         Miss Graham resumed her Hollywood column after the war and, to earn as much money as she could, also wrote for magazines and conducted a radio show and a television show, ''Hollywood Today,'' in the mid-1950's. By 1964 Time magazine could report that Miss Graham had ''deposed Hopper and Parsons as doyenne of the Hollywood columnists,'' appearing in 178 newspapers, compared to about 100 for Miss Hopper and 69 for Miss Parsons.         Miss Graham also produced several more books, three of them centering on Fitzgerald - ''The Real Scott Fitzgerald,'' ''The Rest of the Story'' and ''College of One.'' That volume, published in 1967, after Miss Graham found the handwritten Fitzgerald ''curriculum'' he created for her, listed his favorite books and musical works that he insisted she become familiar with. Other Graham books included ''The Garden of Allah,'' ''Confessions of a Gossip Columnist'' and the steamy autobiographical novel ''A State of Heat'' (1972). She also published ''Hollywood Revisited'' in 1985.         Miss Graham is survived by her daughter, Wendy Fairey, who is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Brooklyn College; her son, Robert Westbrook, now living in Khania, Crete; and by three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in New York next month.       
        Veronica Castang, an actress who performed on and Off Broadway, on television and in a film, died of ovarian cancer on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 50 years old.         Veronica Castang, an actress who performed on and Off Broadway, on television and in a film, died of ovarian cancer on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 50 years old.         Miss Castang made her Broadway debut in 1966 in ''How's the World Treating You?'' Her other New York plays included ''The National Health,'' ''Whose Life Is It, Anyway?'' ''Cloud 9'' and ''After the Prize.'' She often appeared in plays produced at the Phoenix Theater and the Manhattan Theater Club, including ''Sea Marks,'' a two-character play in which she also starred on television.         On television, Miss Castang starred in ''The Elephant Man''; in ''The Widowing of Mrs. Holyroyd''; in the PBS series ''Theater in America''; in the movie ''A Doctor's Story,'' which also starred Art Carney; as a guest on the sitcom ''Kate and Allie,'' and in episodes of the soap operas ''As the World Turns'' and ''All My Children.'' In a Drama by Howard Fast         In 1982, she played the American-born wife of David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, in the two-person drama ''David and Paula'' by Howard Fast, at the 92d Street Y. Richard F. Shepard called her performance brilliant. Writing in The New York Times, Mr. Shepard said Miss Castang ''expresses exactly the right degree of basic love, laced with exasperation, common sense and a strong will of her own.''         Miss Castang was a native of London and studied at the Sorbonne and at Questor's Theater in London.         She is survived by her stepfather, Clive Baker of London, and an aunt, Hilda Castang of Battle, England.       
        Pannonica de Koenigswarter, a patron of jazz performers, died Wednesday of heart failure at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 74 years old.         Pannonica de Koenigswarter, a patron of jazz performers, died Wednesday of heart failure at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 74 years old.         The Baroness de Koenigswarter offered sustanance and care to many musicians who needed help. The saxophonist Charlie Parker died in her home in 1955, and the composer and pianist Thelonious Monk lived there from 1970 until his death in 1982. Recently she had been influential in helping Barry Harris's Jazz Cultural Theater to survive.         A member of the English branch of the Rothschilds, Baroness de Koenigswarter moved to the United States in the early 1950's. As a teen-ager she had fallen in love with jazz, and she quickly became a part of the jazz world. She counted among her friends Charlie Rouse, who also died Wednesday; Coleman Hawkins, Tommy Flanagan, Barry Harris and many other important jazz musicians. They returned her affection: Mr. Monk wrote the tune ''Pannonica'' for her; the pianist Horace Silver wrote ''Nica's Dream'' and the saxophonist Gigi Gryce wrote ''Nica's Tempo.''         She is survived by three daughters, two sons and one grandchild. There is to be a memorial service on Dec. 11 at St. Peter's Church, 54th Street and Lexington Avenue.
