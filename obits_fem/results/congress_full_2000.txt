         Ingrid G. Brainard, a dance historian and teacher of historical dance, died on Feb. 18 at her home in West Newton, Mass. She was 74.         The cause was a heart attack, said Tristram Perry, a spokesman for the Boston Conservatory, where Dr. Brainard taught.         Dr. Brainard received a doctorate in musicology from the University of Gottingen in Germany, writing her dissertation on ''The Choreographer of the Court Dances of Burgundy, France and Italy in the 15th Century.'' Her area of expertise extended through dance of the 18th century.         In addition to reconstructing and staging the dances, Dr. Brainard lectured and wrote for publications including the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the Dance Research Journal, the Harvard Dictionary of Music and Die Musikforschung.         One of the first fellows of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Studies in Cambridge, Mass., Dr. Brainard was an artist in residence at Northeastern University and served as a director and chairwoman of the Congress on Research in Dance. She also founded the Cambridge Court Dancers. She had taught dance history at the Boston Conservatory since 1983.         Her marriage to Paul Brainard ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Christopher, of Newton.       
         Gisele Freund, the German-born photographer who was best known for her portraits of France's literary elite and was a founding member of Magnum Photo Agency, died today in Paris. She was 91.         Ms. Freund was one of Europe's most prominent photographers and a pillar among French feminist intellectuals after fleeing Nazi Germany and settling in Paris in the 1930's.         In the course of her long career, she went on about 80 photographic assignments around the world, mainly for Time and Life. But she is most noted for being in a lot of places with a lot of famous people.         She captured a windblown Andre Malraux on a Paris rooftop, Boris Pasternak, Aldous Huxley and Andre Gide at a congress for the defense of culture; Walter  Benjamin sitting on a bench in the Bibliotheque Nationale; Vladimir Nabokov, Michel Leiris, Henri Michaux and Jean Paulhan in the editorial offices of the magazine Mesures and James Joyce playing the piano for his son, Giorgio.         She specialized in conveying the attitude of her subjects. She focused on hands, body posture and clothing. Reviewing an exhibition of her life's work in 1979, Hilton Kramer wrote in The New York Times that she excelled in ''brilliant documentation rather than originality.''         In a 1996 interview, Ms. Freund said she read her subjects' work and often spent hours discussing their books with them before taking a portrait.         ''This was essential to gaining their confidence,'' she said of Sartre, de Beauvoir, Malraux and Breton. ''I tell many young photographers to do the same thing, but so often they don't want to read about their subjects, they just want to take pictures. For me, at least, studying my subjects first and knowing them personally was essential to taking a good picture.''         Born in Berlin in 1908 to wealthy Jewish parents who collected art, Ms. Freund was given her first camera at the age of 12. As a university student studying sociology in Frankfurt, she became a political activist protesting the rise of Hitler's National Socialism. In 1933 she fled Germany, escaping just as the police were about to arrest her.         She arrived in Paris carrying only a small suitcase, a camera and some film recording the early stages of Nazi violence. She pursued her doctoral studies at the Sorbonne, where her thesis on photography in France in the 19th century met with some skepticism because photography was not considered a serious study.         She used her camera to make a living. But what began as economic necessity rapidly developed into a serious vocation. Although still living the life of a refugee who had become stateless, by 1936 she had scored a double triumph.         Her dissertation was published as a book by Adrienne Monnier, the Paris bookseller who stood at the center of French literary life in the period between the two world wars. And the first of her picture stories was published by the new Life magazine.         Ms. Monnier, whom Ms. Freund met while browsing in her Left Bank bookshop,  became her lifelong mentor and companion, introducing her to the Parisian intellectual set and encouraging her to pursue photography.         Her use of color clashed with the prevailing style of retouched black-and-white studio portraits, but she persevered, saying that color was ''closer to life.''         The Nazi invasion of France in 1940 interrupted her career and she fled again,  first to southern France and then to Argentina, where she worked until the war's end.  In later years Ms. Freund became well known in her adopted France, winning the National Grand Prize for Photography in 1980. She took the official photograph of  Francois Mitterrand, a Socialist, at his presidential inauguration in 1981.         But she gave up photography in the mid-1980's, saying she wanted to spend her  time reading. Her modest Paris apartment did not have a single photograph on the walls, but there were piles of books.         In a statement, President Jacques Chirac praised her today as ''one of the world's greatest photographers.''         ''She was able, better than anyone, to reveal the essence of beings through their expressions,'' he said.         Prime Minister Lionel Jospin hailed Ms. Freund as an ''unparalleled sociologist and reporter who traveled the world with a generous and lucid approach to places and events faraway.''         Her agent, Nina Beskow, said that Ms. Freund had been briefly married ''for paper reasons.'' There were no immediate survivors.         Ms. Freund's portrait of Malraux on the rooftop -- wrapped in a trench coat with a cigarette dangling from his mouth -- is among her most best-known photographs. But when the portrait was adapted for a French postage stamp, the cigarette was famously airbrushed out, in a nod to the times.       
         Margaret Connors Driscoll, the first woman to be chief judge of the Connecticut Juvenile Court, died on Tuesday at the Carolton Chronic and Convalescent Hospital in Fairfield, Conn. She was 85 and lived in Bridgeport, Conn.         Judge Driscoll was named to the juvenile court in 1960 and was chief judge there from 1976 to 1978. An opponent of mandatory sentences and long confinement for juveniles, she was president of the National Council of Juvenile Court Judges in 1976 and 1977.         From 1978 until she retired in 1985, she was a judge on the Connecticut Superior Court.         In 1944, she was the Democratic candidate for Congress from Fairfield County. She was beaten by the Republican incumbent, Clare Boothe Luce.         She was born and reared in Bridgeport and graduated in 1935 from Wellesley College. She received her law degree in 1938 from Yale Law School, one of five women in the class.         Her husband of 48 years, John J. Driscoll, who was president of the Connecticut State Labor Council for 24 years, died in 1994.         She is survived by a son, David, of Chevy Chase, Md.; a sister, Jerri Reilly of Fairfield; and a grandson.       
         Dr. Harriet Lange Rheingold, a child psychologist and research professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina, died on April 29 at a retirement center in Chapel Hill, N.C. She was 92.         Dr. Rheingold did not begin her specialized research until she was 45, after 20 years of patient care and undergraduate teaching. She made a name for herself nationally in the next 20 years with her work in developmental psychology.         She focused on the social and exploratory skills of infants and young children. Her interests ranged from infant sociability and responsiveness to independent behavior and the development of valued traits like sharing, helping and caring.         Her teaching and writings helped to change the way psychologists view normal infant behavior by helping to shape the recognition that infants interact with their environment from birth. Her books included ''The Infant Separates Himself From Her Mother,'' published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1970.         A native New Yorker, she graduated from Cornell University in 1928 with a degree in philosophy and earned a master's in psychology at Columbia University in 1930. She then was a research fellow, psychologist and assistant professor at Rockford College in Illinois.         In 1955 she received a Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Chicago. She was a research psychologist at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., before joining the North Carolina faculty as a research professor in 1964.         In 1985 she organized a symposium, ''Toward a Unified Science of Behavioral Development,'' for the Society for Research in Child Development. The same year she also addressed the 18th World Congress on Early Childhood Education in Jerusalem.         Dr. Rheingold is survived by her husband, Dr. Don W. Hayne; two sons, Paul D. Rheingold of Rye, N.Y., and Dr. Arnold L. Rheingold of Wilmington, Del.; six grandchildren, and two great-grandsons. Her first husband, Dr. Joseph D. Rheingold, a psychiatrist, died in 1978.       
         Anna Sosenko, the songwriter who wrote ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' the manager of Hildegarde -- the legendary cabaret personality who made the song famous -- and the impresario of stage specials that featured such performers as Mary Martin and Ethel Merman, died Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Ms. Sosenko lived, traveled and collected art with Hildegarde for 23 years, and when their partnership splintered in 1956, Ms. Sosenko went on to produce star-studded theatrical events for the benefit of the Friends of Theater and Music Collection of the Museum of the City of New York. She was the force behind tributes celebrating Joshua Logan, George Abbott, Dorothy Fields and Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II.         ''I do this because it means that once a year I get to work with champions,'' she told The New York Times in 1979. ''I know more about stars than anyone. When I produced 'The Raleigh Room' on radio, everybody worked for me. Alan Lerner was my chief writer. I got Tallulah to sing. Do you know what the great stars were? They were mysteries. They didn't spill their guts every Monday, Wednesday and Friday. They had romance and allure. I wish we had more of that today.''         Ms. Sosenko began collecting letters and manuscripts of theatrical and literary personalities early in her career. As the friend and colleague of many international celebrities, she was also the recipient of many such communications and eventually became a leading dealer in the field. She gave up her small shop near Lincoln Center some time before her death but continued to deal privately from her apartment.         Ms. Sosenko donated a good part of her letter and manuscript collection  to the Library of Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, the theater archives of Georgia State University and Rutgers University. Her extensive archive of the business transactions of George and Ira Gershwin was acquired by the Music Division of the Library of Congress.         Ms. Sosenko was born in Camden, N.J., on June 13, 1909, the daughter of Rebecca and Simon Sosenko. Ms. Sosenko's mother ran a restaurant, and occasionally rented rooms, and that was how the Hildegarde-Sosenko relationship began. Hildegarde was then Hildegarde Sell, the daughter of German immigrants who had left her native Milwaukee and was working as an accompanist to singers of varying luster. She rented a room from Ms. Sosenko's mother, and soon the young women became fast friends.         Eventually, the pair made their respective ways to New York -- Hildegarde plugging some of Ms. Sosenko's songs (and not so incidentally some written by Irving Berlin). Over the course of her career, Ms. Sosenko wrote the music and lyrics for more than 15 songs, among them ''I'll Be Yours,'' ''Ask Your Heart'' and ''Why Don't They Leave Us Alone?'' and the English lyrics for ''J'attendrai.'' The idea for her most famous  song, ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' popped into her head one day, she said, when she and Hildegarde were cycling in France and got their French and English mixed up when they stopped to ask for directions.         Ms. Sosenko created, packaged, promoted and managed Hildegarde, who became one of the most celebrated cabaret stars of 1930's and 40's. Usually billed as The Incomparable Hildegarde, an orchid bestowed on her by Walter Winchell, she was booked by Ms. Sosenko into  plush hotel cabaret rooms and supper clubs at least 45 weeks a year. At one engagement in 1946, she was paid $17,500 a week and 50 percent of the gross over $80,000. She was on the cover of Life magazine in 1939, had a Top 10 radio show and traveled with her own orchestra and several dozen pieces of luggage. Her recordings of such songs as ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup,'' ''The Last Time I Saw Paris'' and ''Lili Marlene'' became worldwide hits. Revlon introduced a Hildegarde shade of lipstick and nail polish, a nursery named a rose for her and a linen company, picking up on the way she signed her autograph, introduced a ''Bless You'' handkerchief.         Hildegarde's admirers ranged from enlisted men and officers during World War II to King Gustaf of Sweden and the Prince of Wales, later the Duke of Windsor.         Ms. Sosenko and Hildegarde were equal partners. They lived in a 10-room apartment in the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan and toured Europe and America together. The two acquired an impressive art collection, selected by Ms. Sosenko. She bought works by such artists as Renoir, Manet, Mary Cassatt and Fernand Leger, and a black and white charcoal study by Grant Wood done for his ''Daughters of the American Revolution.'' The collection was sold in the mid-1950's at what was then The Parke-Bernet Galleries.         Ms. Sosenko was also a theater archivist and historian who in 1976 mounted an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York of 75 years of the great stars who appeared on Broadway for the Shuberts -- Lillian Russell, the Barrymores, Al Jolson, Josephine Baker, the Marx Brothers.         An intense, gregarious and outspoken woman, Ms. Sosenko was known for her business acumen and did not suffer fools, gladly or otherwise. She never hesitated to correct or contradict, and such was the force of her personality that she was rarely challenged even when, on occasion, she was wrong. She was once described as having a voice, when angry, ''that could bring back Judge Crater.''         Ms. Sosenko, who is survived by a brother, Jay Jerome, and a sister, Ruth Goodman, both of Cherry Hill, N.J., had no false modesty.         ''I've probably had the biggest people in show business work for me,'' Ms. Sosenko once said, referring to her benefits and the galaxy of stars she enticed to participate, among them Julie Andrews, Rex Harrison, Liza Minnelli, Sid Caesar, Natalia Makarova and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. ''They know when I do a show, it's going to be a great show because I only do great things,'' she said. ''If they're not great, I'm not interested.''         But she did have a sense of humor of sorts. No one knows why she and Hildegarde parted in the mid-1950's, but they eventually made up. Two days after she turned 85, Hildegarde was performing at the Russian Tea Room in 1991 and, of course, offered a rendition of her 1934 signature song, ''Darling, Je Vous Aime Beaucoup.'' She observed that it was a song she never grew tired of singing. Ms. Sosenko, who had composed it and was one of many friends and well-wishers in the audience, brought down the house when she countered, ''But I'm tired of it.''       
         Phyllis Propp Fowle, a New York lawyer who was the first woman to be an officer of the Army judge advocate general's corps, died Thursday in Manhattan. She was 92 and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.         She was also the only woman in the corps to serve overseas during World War II. Colonel Propp, as she was known to her former Army colleagues, was made a distinguished member of the corps at a banquet in her honor in April 1999 at the Judge Advocate General's School in Charlottesville, Va.         A native of Laurel, Iowa, and a 1930 graduate of the University of Iowa, she earned her law degree there and was the only woman in the law school's class of 1933. She was working in the legal department of the Federal Land Bank in Omaha in 1942 when Congress opened the Army to women by creating the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps. She was in the first group to sign up.         As a captain in 1942, she persuaded the Army to transfer her to the judge advocate general's corps. In January 1945 she reported to European Command headquarters in Paris.         She rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and processed hundreds of legal cases in Frankfurt and Heidelberg, Germany. One involved the Hessian crown jewels, purloined by three Army officers from Kronburg castle outside Frankfurt. Early in 1947, when the Army discharged all its women, it asked Colonel Propp to remain as the civilian chief of legal assistance, which she did until 1951.         From then until the 1970's, while she was in private practice in Manhattan, she served as an advocate general in the Army Reserve, encouraging female law students to follow her path into the corps. She formally retired from practice two years ago.         Mrs. Fowle is survived by her husband, Farnsworth Fowle, a retired New York Times reporter and former foreign correspondent, whom she married in Europe 49 years ago.       
         Ruth Rubin, a scholar, collector and performer of Yiddish folk songs who lugged a tape recorder into hundreds of immigrants' living rooms in an effort to preserve a vanishing cultural tradition, died on Sunday in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 93.         A resident of the Sarah R. Neumann Nursing Home, she formerly lived in Manhattan.         One of the first women to become a prominent folklorist, Mrs. Rubin was also among the first American scholars to document the culture of Eastern European Jews, anticipating by decades the Yiddish revival of the 1970's. Starting in the 1930's, she amassed a collection of about 2,000 songs -- love ballads, lullabies, songs of the factories and streets -- still considered unparalleled in its scope.         ''It is arguably the most important collection, because it's so early,'' said Steven Zeitlin, the director of City Lore, the New York Center for Urban Folk Culture. ''Much of the material dies with the succession of generations. She was collecting songs from the people that learned them in the old country.''         Mrs. Rubin, whose books included ''A Treasury of Jewish Folksong'' (1950) and ''Voices of a People: The Story of Yiddish Folksong'' (1963), also performed the songs in concert and on records. Her studio recordings, first made for Folkways in the 1940's, are available through the Smithsonian Institution.         ''Eastern European Yiddish folk song,'' Mrs. Rubin wrote in the preface to ''Voices of a People,''  ''reflects vividly the life of a community of many millions over a period of many generations. In the songs, we catch the manner of speech and phrase, the wit and humor, the dreams and aspirations, the nonsense, jollity, the pathos and struggle of an entire people.''         Unlike klezmer music, which was performed primarily by men at public occasions, the songs Mrs. Rubin collected flourished in more intimate, domestic settings -- in the kitchen, over the cradle -- and were sung almost exclusively by women, a group largely ignored by the cultural chroniclers of her day.         ''While Irving Howe was writing 'World of Our Fathers,' she was, in a sense, at work on the world of our mothers,'' Mr. Zeitlin said.         Mrs. Rubin was born Rifke Rosenblatt in Montreal on Sept. 1, 1906, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Bessarabia. As a young woman she moved to New York, with its swirling ferment of Yiddish music, literature and theater, and in 1929 published a volume of her own poems in Yiddish. In 1932 she married Harry Rubin, who died in 1971; the couple's only child, Michael, died in 1959. Mrs. Rubin is survived by a sister, Esther Spivack Marks, of Toronto.         In the mid-1930's Mrs. Rubin began to concentrate seriously on folklore, going on to study with the eminent Yiddish scholar Max Weinreich and, during World War II, translating diaries smuggled out of ghettos and Nazi camps. With the end of the war and the revelation of the extent of the Holocaust, and of its sweeping destruction of Yiddish culture, Mrs. Rubin became even more determined to preserve a piece of what remained by making field recordings.         Dragging her bulky reel-to-reel tape recorder from house to house in cities in Canada and the United States, she captured well-known songs like ''Roizhinkes Mit Mandeln'' (''Raisins and Almonds'') and lesser-known material like ''A Brivele der Maman'' (''A Little Letter to Mama'') and ''Oy, di lumpn /zey zenen shpionen'' (''Oh, the lumpen /  they are spies'').         In the last decades of the 20th century, Mrs. Rubin's work was a cornerstone of the Yiddish revival movement. With an older generation of Jewish singers dying off, young musicians who wanted to learn Yiddish folksongs turned to her books and records. Mrs. Rubin's field recordings are now housed in various collections, including the Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York.         Mrs. Rubin earned a Ph.D. in 1976 from Union Graduate School in Cleveland, writing her dissertation on the songs of Jewish women. She received an honorary doctorate from the New England Conservatory of Music and YIVO's Lifetime Achievement Award, among other honors.         Although she performed in prestigious concert halls like Town Hall and the Carnegie Recital Hall, Mrs. Rubin regarded these appearances not as recitals but as links in a chain of cultural transmission she hoped would stretch far into the future.         ''She didn't try and put on any great airs,'' recalled the folk singer Pete Seeger, a longtime friend who occasionally performed with her. ''She just sang a song very simply. She was mainly interested in seeing that the song got out so that other people would learn it and sing.''       
         Jane Prizant Gilman, a lawyer who was long active in civic, civil  rights and political organizations, died June 7 in Middletown, N.Y. She was 73 and lived in Hudson, N.Y., and Middletown.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         Born in Manhattan, Mrs. Gilman studied at Adelphi University and St. John's University before she received her law degree from New York University in 1950. In 1956, she moved to Orange County and became a partner in the firm of Gilman, Gilman & Guerreiro.         She held leadership positions in the Orange Association for the Help of Retarded Children, the County Health Organization and local branches of the N.A.A.C.P. and the League of Women Voters.         In the mid-1950's, she was a lawyer for the Temporary Commission on the Courts of the State of New York, a panel on court reform known as the Tweed Commission.         In April, the Orange County Human Rights Commission honored her for her pro bono work for poor women and others needing legal help. She was in private practice in Middletown until her death.         She was married in 1957 to Benjamin A. Gilman, a law partner and fellow Republican, and in 1972 worked in his successful campaign for Congress. Her own bid for the nomination for state attorney general in 1978 was rebuffed by the party organization in Albany.         After her divorce that year from Representative Gilman, she married Manuel G. Guerreiro, a former judge on the Family Court of New York City, who died in 1994. She is survived by a daughter, Susan Harts of Bedford Hills, N.Y.; two sons, Jonathan P. Gilman of Flemington, N.J., and Harrison P. Gilman of Middletown; a stepdaughter, Beatriz A. Guerreiro-Rowe of Darien, Conn.; a stepson, Matthew Guerreiro of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.       
         Mary Benson, an author, journalist and political campaigner who wrote passionately about the struggle for racial equality in her native South Africa,  died at home in London on Monday, her literary agent, Felicity Bryan, said. She was 80.         Miss Benson's books included a novel, ''At the Still Point,'' and biographies of Nelson Mandela and Winnie Mandela, his wife at the time, written while Mr. Mandela was still serving his long prison term and decades before he would become president of South Africa. In her memoir, ''A Far Cry: The Making of a South African,'' Miss Benson told how her early racial prejudice gave way to a wholehearted repudiation of white minority rule in South Africa.         Along the way, she grew close to many of the leading figures in the anti-apartheid movement, and her tiny apartment in St. John's Wood became an unofficial refuge for South Africans working for the cause in London.         It was Miss Benson whom Mr. Mandela sought out one evening in 1962 when, after slipping illegally out of South Africa to raise support in West and East Africa, he made a quick side trip to London. She had been expecting Oliver Tambo of the African National Congress; when she opened the door, Mr. Mandela was standing beside him.         ''I can't think what I gave them to eat, because I am a very indifferent cook, but it was quite an extraordinary evening,'' Miss Benson recalled in 1996, describing how Mr. Mandela paced up and down her apartment, brimming with ideas. ''He talked so excitedly and with such enthusiasm. It was unforgettable.''         Mary Benson was born into the privileged world of country clubs and servants in white South Africa in 1919. Passionate about films and bored by life at home, she traveled to Hollywood on a cargo ship as a teenager, using a mix of charm and determination to win interviews with Jimmy Stewart and other movie stars, about whom she then wrote.         Restless and daring, Miss Benson served as an aide to various British generals in the Middle East, North Africa and Europe. She worked as a volunteer with displaced persons after the war, before becoming secretary to the director David Lean.         It was not until 1948, when she read Alan Paton's ''Cry, the Beloved Country'' that Miss Benson saw her country with new eyes and discovered the cause that was to be her life's passion. She began a correspondence with Mr. Paton (she was also to develop intense correspondences and lifelong friendships with Athol Fugard, among others) and campaigned in London for the rights of black Africans. She helped found the Africa Bureau with the Rev. Michael Scott, an Anglican priest who championed Namibian independence and with whom she fell in love.         Miss Benson returned to South Africa in 1957, becoming secretary of the defense fund for the 156 people, Mr. Mandela among them, who had been charged with treason for opposing the country's apartheid laws. Compelled to leave the post when she became ill with a debilitating form of arthritis that was to dog her throughout her life, Miss Benson turned her attention to writing. When the African National Congress was banned, she continued to support its leaders, visiting Mr. Mandela when he was forced underground and at least once accompanying him in a car in which he posed as her chauffeur.         Among Miss Benson's first books was a history of the outlawed African National Congress, published in the United States as ''South Africa: The Struggle for a Birthright.'' In 1964, after reporting on the political trials that resulted in long prison terms for the A.N.C.'s members, Miss Benson was placed under house arrest and her passport was confiscated. She left the country in 1966, returning only once in the next 24 years -- for a month in 1968, to be at her father's deathbed -- but continued to write about South Africa through the late 1990's. She never married.         Among other projects, Miss Benson also edited Athol Fugard's ''Notebooks'' and wrote a number of radio plays for the BBC. She was also the author of ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater.''         On the occasion of Miss Benson's 80th birthday in December, Mr. Mandela sent a message from South Africa. ''It reminds me of all the great help you gave to me and my family while I was in prison,'' he wrote. ''I send you all my thanks and appreciation of your generous friendship over half a lifetime.''         Correction:  June 23, 2000, Friday  An obituary yesterday about the South African writer Mary Benson misstated the title of one of her books. It is ''Athol Fugard and Barney Simon: Bare Stage, a Few Props, Great Theater,'' not ''Athol Fugard and Barney Smith.''       
         Bertha Holt, whose family's struggle to adopt Korean orphans in the 1950's led to a movement that found American homes for thousands of children from overseas, died on Monday at her home in Creswell, Ore., after a stroke on July 24. She was 96.         Mrs. Holt first attracted national attention when she and her husband, Harry, adopted eight abandoned children whose fathers were American soldiers.         In 1954, Mrs. Holt, a nurse, and her husband, who was a farmer and a lumberjack, went to a high school auditorium in Eugene, Ore., to watch a film about Amerasian children in South Korean orphanages.         ''We had never heard of such poverty and despair,'' Mrs. Holt later wrote in ''The Seed from the East,'' one of her four books on adoption. ''We had never seen such emaciated arms and legs, such bloated starvation-stomachs and such wistful little faces searching for someone to care.''         At first, the Holts sent money to South Korean orphanages but soon decided that the children needed families. They were both about 50 years old, and had already reared six biological children. Each wanted to adopt eight Korean children, Mrs. Holt later recalled, but each was afraid it would be difficult to persuade the other to take so many.         At the time, federal law prevented any family from adopting more than two foreign-born children. But in 1955, Congress passed the Bill for Relief of Certain War Orphans, specifically to allow the Holts to adopt four boys and four girls, ranging in age from infancy to 3 1/2. Adoption laws were eventually changed to make the process easier.         At the Holt house, soon there were children lined up to get a daily dose of vitamins, and the washing machine ran day and night.         Mr. Holt returned to South Korea for more children, while Mrs. Holt found families in the United States willing to take them.         In 1956, they founded the agency that would become Holt International Children's Services. At the time, there was no system in place for international adoptions. The Korean-American children were the first such large group to be adopted.         The Holts, who were Baptist, believed with missionary fervor that the world's orphans were the responsibility of American families. Holt International now handles about 1,000 international adoptions each year from 12 countries. In all, 16,000 foreign-born children were adopted in the United States last year.         Until days before her death, Grandma Holt, as she came to be known, was active in the agency. One of her daughters, Molly Holt, works for the Holt agency in South Korea.         She is also survived by nine other children, Barbara Chambers, Suzanne Peterson, Linda Pack, Robert Holt, Mary Last, Christine Russell, Helen Stampe, Paul Holt and Betty Blankenship; three sisters, Beulah Stronczek, Katherine Stanger and Grace Fisher; a brother, William L. Holt; 19 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.         Though the poverty they had seen in the Korean film footage shocked them, the Holts had seen hard times themselves. Bertha Marian Holt was born on Feb. 5, 1904, in Des Moines. Her father was a schoolteacher and a mail carrier. She received a degree in nursing in 1926, and the next year married a cousin, Harry Holt. The couple moved to South Dakota, where they became ''custom farmers,'' working land owned by others until they had saved enough to buy their own.         In the face of drought and poor farming conditions, Mr. Holt also milled flour and mined lignite coal. But during the Depression, the Holts left their farm for taxes owed and moved to the Willamette Valley in Oregon.         There the Holts prospered, eventually owning a lumber mill, but in 1950 Mr. Holt suffered a heart attack. The Holts turned to prayer, asking God to give them a mission and allow Mr. Holt more time to live. The orphans, they believed, were that mission.         While in South Korea in 1964, Harry Holt suffered another heart attack and died. Many thought the agency would close, but Mrs. Holt took over, traveling endlessly. She also worked to improve conditions at the Il San Center in Korea, built by the Holts as an orphanage and now home to 300 disabled children, and she lobbied other countries to set up adoption programs.         ''She would say, 'You know, I'm just a grandma, but here's what I think,' '' said Susan Soon-Keum Cox, who was adopted through the Holt agency and now works there as a vice president.         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson named Mrs. Holt the National Mother of the Year, and in 1995 she became the only non-Korean to receive the Korea National Merit Award. But, Ms. Cox said, Mrs. Holt liked to say that she preferred the  photographs that children sent from all over the world.         ''She championed the idea that love and a safe, permanent home could transcend differences of nationality, race and ethnic background,'' Hillary Rodham Clinton said in a statement after Mrs. Holt's death.         In letters to agency employees, adopted children and adoptive families, Mrs. Holt spoke frequently of the Lord and quoted the Bible, which she said she had read 40 times.         Those who knew her said she seemed to have enormous energy. In 1996, she set the world record for the 400 meter race in the over-90 age group at the Hayward Classic in Eugene.       
         Loretta Young, the Academy Award-winning actress whose high cheekbones, pale skin and luminous eyes made her a reigning Hollywood beauty of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 87 and lived in Palm Springs, Calif.         Miss Young, who won an Oscar as best actress for her performance in ''The Farmer's Daughter'' in 1947, later became a favorite of television viewers as the glowing star who twirled onto the stage in a designer gown each week to introduce an uplifting drama on ''The Loretta Young Show.'' She retired almost 40 years ago and never returned to the big screen.         Miss Young died at the home of her sister, Georgiana Montalban, the wife of the actor Ricardo Montalban, said Norman Brokaw, the chairman of the William Morris agency and her agent for 50 years. The cause was ovarian cancer, he said.         Hers was an art learned early in life. She first appeared on screen at age 4 as a fairy in the silent film ''The Primrose Ring.'' In 1928, she became a leading lady, starring opposite Lon Chaney in ''Laugh, Clown, Laugh.'' In addition to ''The Farmer's Daughter,'' in which she played an effervescent Swedish-born maid who runs for Congress, she appeared in nearly 100 films, often in the arms of such matinee idols as Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Tyrone Power or Cary Grant.         Her movies included ''Taxi'' with James Cagney in 1932; ''Zoo in Budapest'' with Gene Raymond in 1933; ''Man's Castle'' with Tracy, also in 1933; ''Call of the Wild'' with Gable in 1935; ''The Stranger'' with Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson in 1946; and ''The Bishop's Wife'' with Grant in 1947.         Miss Young's screen image suggested a blend of virtuous poise, sensuality and vulnerability, and in fact, she once admitted to having had ''crushes'' on all of her leading men and to being ''susceptible'' to men in general. Reflecting on her appeal to moviegoers, she told Edward J. Funk, co-author of an unpublished autobiography:         ''My appeal wouldn't have been to the intellectuals or the neurotics. Nor to the shop girls and secretaries -- that would have been Joan Crawford's market. But there were an awful lot of women out there who were like me -- who were willing to play by the rules, didn't sleep around and were very aggressive. A Loretta Young movie had a happy ending; that's what it was geared to: a nice husband, nice lover, no abuse of any kind -- that's what the heroes and heroines were in those days.''         While Miss Young said she considered herself more of a ''movie star'' than an actress, she achieved her greatest popularity as the ''first lady'' of dramatic television, with ''The Loretta Young Show.'' In the half-hour anthology series, which ran on NBC from 1953 to 1961, Miss Young played characters from Queen Nefertiti to a nightclub singer. A trademark of the show was her glamorous entrance.         ''I did that to mollify the show's designer, Marusha,'' Miss Young said in a 1995 interview. ''I initially just walked through the doors, and Marusha was upset because no one would see the wonderful back of the dress.''         So Miss Young, who had studied ballet as a child, asked for a retake in which she entered the set and pirouetted before walking toward the camera. Viewers loved it.         The show at first was an audacious step for her, since at the time a fearful Hollywood was attacking television, a new medium and a formidable rival. Miss Young said friends and advisers warned her that if she appeared on television regularly she would be ''blackballed out of this business'' and ''never get another job.'' But she saw television as the ''wave of the future,'' and signed a contract with NBC and Procter & Gamble to produce and star in the dramatic series.         Miss Young appeared in 165 episodes. A devout Catholic, she ended each show by delivering a homily to the audience. Her show extolled ''respect for law and order and for disciplined deportment and character-building standards,'' she said in her 1961 memoir, ''The Things I Had to Learn,'' written with Helen Ferguson. ''Above all, we want to prove the strength, the good, really, of people.''         Although critics derided the moralistic melodramas as ''Sunday night soap opera,'' the series became one of the most popular on television, earning Miss Young millions of dollars and a reputation as one of the best businesswomen in Hollywood.         In 1972, she was awarded $559,000 by a jury in a breach-of-contract suit against NBC in which she contended that the network had humiliated her through the overseas release of introductory and closing segments of the show showing her in outmoded gowns and hairstyles.         She won the first of three Emmy Awards in 1953, which made her the first actress to win both an Oscar and an Emmy. The annual poll of TV-Radio Mirror readers earned her six consecutive gold medals as their favorite actress, and an episode of the series received the first television Grand Prix at the 1959 Cannes International Film Festival. The series was revived in 1962 as ''The New Loretta Young Show'' and ran for a year.         In 1995, Nostalgia Television, a national cable network, began reruns of the original show, the rights to which Miss Young had turned over to her son, Christopher Lewis, and his wife, Linda, who are film producers.         Perhaps the biggest controversy in her long career arose years after she left the screen. In 1994, her adopted daughter, Judy Lewis, maintained in an autobiography, ''Uncommon Knowledge,'' that she was the daughter of Miss Young and Clark Gable and that she was conceived during the making of ''Call of the Wild,'' in which the two starred.         In 1935 when the film was made, Miss Young was single and Gable was married to Ria Langham. Miss Lewis said that Miss Young was terrified that a scandal would end her career and Gable's, and that she had arranged to give birth in secret, taking more than a year off from work and citing an unspecified illness. Later, Miss Lewis asserted, Miss Young arranged her ''adoption,'' retrieving her from an orphanage where she had been temporarily placed.         For years, Miss Young refused to confirm or deny her daughter's account, dismissing it as ''a rumor from a bygone era.'' After the book's release, mother and daughter did not speak to each other for months.         Mr. Brokaw said yesterday, ''She didn't want to ever publicly acknowledge it.''         Miss Young, whose given name was Gretchen Michaela, was born on Jan. 6, 1913, in Salt Lake City. When she was 2 her parents separated, and her mother moved with her daughters and son, Jack, to Hollywood. She borrowed $1,000 from a Roman Catholic bishop, persuaded a department store to let her have furniture on credit and opened a boardinghouse.         Miss Young attended a convent school and began appearing as a child extra in movies, often working with her older sisters, Polly Ann and Betty Jane.         First National Studio signed her to a contract at age 14, put braces on her teeth and renamed her Loretta, a change she gladly accepted as evidence that she was on her way to becoming a star.         In 1930, at 17, Miss Young eloped with Grant Withers, her co-star in the film ''The Second-Story Murder.'' The marriage was annulled the following year. In 1940, she married Thomas H. A. Lewis, an advertising executive who later became a producer of her television series. The couple, who divorced in 1969, had two sons, Christopher, a producer, and Peter, a guitarist and songwriter.         Strong-willed, independent and rebellious, Miss Young was among the first female stars to command a six-figure salary. In 1939, when she rejected a five-year, $2 million contract with 20th Century Fox to try working as a freelance actress, she was blackballed by the studios. She made only one film, ''Eternally Yours,'' with David Niven, during the next two years.         She owned the rights to ''The Loretta Young Show'' and had control over its content, casting and final editing. And she paid strict attention to the show's moral tone.         During the filming for one episode, ''Come to the Stable,'' about two nuns who come to the United States from France to build a hospital for children, Miss Young became so disturbed by swearing on the set that she came up with the idea of a ''swear box.'' Cast and crew had to contribute up to 25 cents for each offense, and the money was donated to a home for unmarried mothers.         In 1963, at age 50, with movie offers still coming her way, Miss Young left show business. She later acknowledged that her retirement was perhaps premature and that she had always intended to resume her career. Although she was offered more than 150 parts, her last major role was that of an owner of a fashion magazine in ''Lady in the Corner,'' a 1989 television drama.         She lived an almost reclusive life and was rarely interviewed or photographed, although she occasionally appeared in public to promote one of her favorite charities. Her later years were quietly shared with her third husband, Jean Louis, a designer for Columbia Pictures, whom she married in 1994. Mr. Louis won an Oscar of his own in 1956 for his designs for ''The Solid Gold Cadillac.''         Mr. Louis died in 1997. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Montalban, Miss Young is survived by her three children.         Miss Young said that her faith sustained her through the difficult times in her life and that her mother had given her an invaluable sense of worth, independence and flair. In her memoir, she wrote: ''I believe that if we have lived our lives fully and well, and have accomplished, at least in part, the things which we were put here to do, we will be prepared -- mentally, spiritually and physically -- for our separation from this world.''

         Annie Devine, a no-nonsense Mississippi trailblazer for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, died on Aug. 22 at a hospital in Ridgeland, Miss. She was 88 and lived in nearby Canton.         Mrs. Devine, a soft-spoken woman with a ready smile, became deeply involved in the civil rights movement of the early 1960's. She helped organize voter registration drives in Canton and surrounding Madison County, where fewer than 100 of the county's estimated 10,000 black adults were registered.         At the time, blacks in the Deep South were kept from the ballot boxes by legal chicanery and worse; in Mississippi 94 percent of black adults were not registered. Thanks largely to Mrs. Devine, blacks began to show up at the county courthouse almost daily, demanding to register.         She attended the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City along with Victoria Gray-Adams and Fannie Lou Hamer. Their objective was to unseat their state's all-white delegation and be recognized as delegates of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, of which Mrs. Devine was a founder.         After that failed, the three sought to run for the House of Representatives, but were shunned by the white party establishment and blocked from running as independents. When the new Congress was sworn in January 1965, the three women, backed by hundreds of protesters, demanded that the House deny membership to Mississippi's representatives-elect because blacks had consistently been prevented from registering and voting in the state. Their effort, called the Mississippi Challenge, failed in the short run, but led to a nationwide lobbying drive by the Mississippi Freedom Democrats and calls for Congressional investigations into voting in Mississippi. Thus, the three women's resolve fed into the groundswell that produced the Voting Rights Act of 1965.         Annie Devine was born in Mobile, Ala., and reared in Canton. She graduated from Tougaloo Southern Christian College, now Tougaloo College, and taught in the public schools. She was an executive for a life-insurance company before she threw her energies into the civil rights struggle.         In the 1960's she also helped found the Child Development Group of Mississippi. Under its aegis she was a longtime volunteer in the Head Start program, involving parents and marshaling community support.         Mrs. Devine's husband, Andrew, died in 1973. She is survived by two daughters, Monette Watts of Harvest, Ala., and Barbara Russell of Canton; a son, Andrew, of Omaha; a brother, Garfield Heath of Detroit; 8 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.
