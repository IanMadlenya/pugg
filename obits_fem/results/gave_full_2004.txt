         Ann Miller, the long-legged tap-dancer with the lacquered raven hair and Nefertiti eye makeup whose athleticism made her a staple of big-screen musicals in the 1940's and 50's, died on Thursday at a Los Angeles hospital. She was believed to be about 80.         The cause was lung cancer, Esme Chandlee, her friend and former publicist, told The Associated Press.         She was, in her heyday, America's female tap star, inheriting the mantle of Ginger Rogers and Eleanor Powell. She always took a vigorous approach to dancing, and her agent said she could produce 500 taps a minute. Nobody ever disputed him.         As a young actress, she consistently won praise for her roles in movies like ''Easter Parade'' (1948), in which she danced most gracefully with Fred Astaire as she tried to woo him away from Judy Garland; ''Kiss Me Kate'' (1953), in which she portrayed Lois Lane, the nightclub hoofer who became Bianca in Cole Porter's version of ''Taming of the Shrew''; and ''On the Town'' (1949), which paired her with Jules Munshin, the sidekick of Frank Sinatra and Gene Kelly, sailors desperately looking for girls on their 24-hour leave in New York. These, she said, were her favorite movies, and most fans and critics would agree.         She first attracted attention in 1938, when she played the fudge-making, ballet-dancing daughter in Frank Capra's ''You Can't Take It With You.'' And in 1979, after a long hiatus, she made a tremendous comeback, starring with Mickey Rooney in ''Sugar Babies,'' a musical salute to vaudeville that ran for nearly three years on Broadway. She enjoyed the stardom that she felt she had been denied earlier.         ''At MGM I always played the second feminine lead,'' she told the writer Bob Thomas in 1990. ''I was never the star in films. I was the brassy, good-hearted showgirl. I never really had my big moment on the screen. 'Sugar Babies' gave me the stardom that my soul kind of yearned for.''         Johnnie Lucille Ann Collier was born in Chireno, Tex. Her father, John Alfred Collier, was a successful criminal lawyer who counted among his clients Clyde Barrow, Bonnie Parker and Baby Face Nelson. He dreamed of having a son he could call John Jr.; instead, he named his daughter Johnnie. Her mother was the former Clara Birdwell, whose mother was a Cherokee.         The Colliers soon moved to Houston, where her mother saw to it that she studied piano and violin but mostly dancing, partly to build up legs affected by rickets, a condition caused by a vitamin D deficiency that can lead to softening of the bones and deformity.         When Ms. Miller was about 10 her parents' marriage fell apart and her mother took her to California. There she developed a dance routine and performed at meetings of local civic organization. She earned $5 a night, plus tips.         A few years later she was seen by Benny Rubin, a comic and talent scout, who happened to be escorting Lucille Ball. They arranged a movie audition, which led to her first film, a nonspeaking part in ''New Faces of 1937'' for RKO.         Other light films followed, and while she aspired to the romantic roles that were being enjoyed by other dancing stars, like Ginger Rogers and Eleanor Powell, she was offered none.         In the 1940's she appeared in a string of forgettable films. Among them were ''Melody Ranch'' (1940), which is recalled now only because it was the first time Gene Autry kissed a woman for the cameras; ''Time Out for Rhythm'' (1941), a vehicle for Rudy Vallee; ''Priorities on Parade'' (1942), a feel-good movie for soldiers starring Jerry Colonna; ''Reveille With Beverly'' (1943); ''What's Buzzin' Cousin?'' (1943); ''Jam Session'' (1944) and ''Eadie Was a Lady'' (1945).         In 1946 she married a millionaire, Reese Llewellyn Milner. The marriage failed within a year, and she went back to work, winning a big part in perhaps her most memorable film, MGM's ''Easter Parade.'' She got the part only when Cyd Charisse, the first choice for the role, broke a leg, and she had to dance in flats because Fred Astaire was barely taller than she was.         In 1951 and 1952 she appeared in ''Two Tickets to Broadway'' and ''Lovely to Look At,'' a remake of Jerome Kern's ''Roberta.'' Later that decade she was in ''Deep in My Heart,'' a tribute to Sigmund Romberg; ''Hit the Deck,'' set to Vincent Youmans's music; and ''The Opposite Sex,'' a musical version of Clare Boothe Luce's play, ''The Women.''         By the late 50's she had moved from movies to nightclubs and also appeared frequently on television programs like ''The Ed Sullivan Show,'' ''The Hollywood Palace'' and ''Laugh-In.''         In 1969 she scored a Broadway triumph when she took on the title role of ''Mame,'' which had been originated by Angela Lansbury. The critics felt she rivaled Ms. Lansbury, and Clive Barnes said in The New York Times that she gave the show ''a real shot in the arm.''         Jobs were scarce after that, though in 1972 she made a memorable commercial for Heinz's ''Great American Soups'' commercial, in which she danced atop an eight-foot soup can.         She went on the road with touring companies of ''Can-Can,'' ''Panama Hattie,'' ''Hello, Dolly!'' and ''Blithe Spirit.'' Her biggest comeback of all came in 1979, with ''Sugar Babies.''         Two more marriages, to William Moss in 1958 and to Arthur Cameron in 1961, ended in divorce. In between marriages she dated Conrad Hilton, Howard Hughes and Louis B. Mayer, among others. There are no immediate survivors.         In her prime, Ms. Miller's flamboyantly glamorous appearance, especially her hair, which was often a bouffant, lacquered wig, sometimes made her the butt of jokes about falling down and breaking her hair.         In later years, she seemed to revel in making television appearances in her wig and Egyptian-style makeup. In her 1972 autobiography, ''Miller's High Life,'' and in other writings about her serious spiritual interests, she even laid claim to having been Queen Hatshepsut of Egypt in an earlier life.         But she said that throughout her life she wondered ''whatever happened to Lucille Collier from Texas.''         ''There's a part of me that will always be Lucille Collier, and she's just waiting for this long-winded Hollywood love affair to end with the Ann Miller creature.''       
         Fanny Blankers-Koen, a Dutch housewife who emulated her hero, Jesse Owens, and won four gold medals in track and field in one Olympics -- the only woman to do so -- died yesterday in Amsterdam. She was 85.         The International Association of Athletics Federations, which oversees track and field, announced her death on its Web site. Her daughter, Fanny, said she had had serious heart problems over the past several years, Reuters reported, and the track and field federation said she also had Alzheimer's disease.         In the 1936 Berlin Olympics, 18-year-old Francina Elsje Koen (pronounced COON) finished fifth in the women's 4x100-meter relay and sixth in the high jump. Her most memorable moment came, however, when she got the autograph of Owens, the American sprinter who won four gold medals.         The 1940 and 1944 Olympics were canceled because of World War II. In 1940, Koen married her coach, Jan Blankers, 12 years her senior, and by the time the 1948 London Olympics arrived, they were raising a son, Jan, and a daughter, Fanny.         Blankers-Koen held or shared six world records -- in the 100-meter dash, 80-meter hurdles, high jump, long jump, 4x100 relay and 4x400 relay -- but she was 30 years old. No woman in Olympic track that year was older.         At the time, elite track and field was still an amateur sport. She trained only two hours a day, twice a week, and in the winter only on Saturday afternoons. She pedaled to practice with her two children in a bicycle basket behind her. They would build sand castles in the dirt high-jump pit while she worked out.         Her track career upset people.         ''I got very many bad letters, people writing that I must stay home with my children and that I should not be allowed to run on a track with -- how do you say it? -- short trousers,'' she said in The New York Times in 1982. ''But I was a good mother. I had no time for much besides my house chores and training, and when I went shopping it was only to buy food for the family and never to buy dresses.         ''One newspaperman wrote that I was too old to run, that I should stay at home and take care of my children. When I got to London, I pointed my finger at him and I said, 'I show you.' ''         She did. In the 1948 London Olympics, the 5-foot-9, 140-pound Blankers-Koen won four of the nine track and field events for women. First came the 100 meters in 11.9 seconds. Then the 80-meter hurdles in 11.2 seconds, an Olympic record, though she had to survive a three-way photo finish and a huge scare.         For many minutes, the judges examined the finish photo. When the band struck up ''God Save the King,'' she thought it meant that an English rival had won. Instead, the music marked the arrival of King George VI, and moments later Blankers-Koen learned that she had won.         Next came the 200 meters and more painful moments. Before the semifinals, she told her husband she was nervous and wanted to quit the Olympics because of the pressure. ''Two Olympic medals is enough,'' she said.         Years later, her husband remembered in The Times: ''I had to talk much. There is only one chance in your life that you can perhaps win three gold medals, and that's the chance that you will take.''         She cried, then won the 200 final by 7 yards, the widest margin ever in an Olympics, in 24.4 seconds. Then, in the 4x100-meter relay, she took the baton for the anchor leg in fourth place, 5 yards behind the leader, and won a photo finish in 47.5 seconds.         In seven days, she ran 11 races and won them all. When she returned to Amsterdam, she was driven through crowded streets in an open carriage drawn by four white horses. The celebration almost equaled the one held when the city was liberated from German occupation.         Queen Juliana made her a knight in the Order of Orange Nassau. Neighbors gave her a bicycle so she wouldn't have to run so much.         ''I didn't know the Dutch people were so interested in track,'' she said in The Times. ''They never came to any of our meets.''         She was born on a 62-acre farm outside the Dutch village of Baarn, the only daughter of a well-off father who became a government inspector. When she started track at age 15, she was already a good swimmer. The pool director soon told her she had to choose one sport. She chose track, and by 17 she had broken her first national record.         Blankers-Koen kept running after the 1948 Olympics. She won three gold medals in the 1950 European championships and, despite painful boils on a leg, she ran the 80-meter hurdles in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. She became dizzy from medication, tripped on a hurdle and dropped out of the race.         In 1955, she retired from track but kept in shape with running, swimming, cycling and tennis. Her husband died in 1977.         She remained a national hero. When she was 64, her son said in The Times: ''I remember when I was growing up, there were always so many people greeting my mother on the street that I was embarrassed. I'd walk five paces behind her. I don't have that feeling anymore, but I still walk five paces behind her. That's because she walks so fast. Mother still goes everywhere in a hurry.''       
         Charlotte Zwerin, a documentary filmmaker known for insightful depictions of visual and performing artists like Christo, Willem de Kooning, Ella Fitzgerald and Thelonious Monk, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 72.         The cause was lung cancer, her niece Lisa Tesone said.         Ms. Zwerin worked for many years with David and Albert Maysles, early practitioners of the documentary genre known as cinéma vérité, which uses a small camera to capture the drama of daily experience. Her editing for them was of such quality that they gave her credit as the third director of well-known films like ''Gimme Shelter'' (1970), an account of the Rolling Stones' 1969 tour of the United States.         It was her decision to include the band members' reactions to the killing of a fan on the stage of a concert at the Altamont Speedway in Livermore, Calif., the site of the tour's last concert.         ''The real hero of the making of the film was Charlotte Zwerin, who edited it and got a directing credit,'' Stephen Lighthill, a cameraman, said in an interview with Salon.com. ''I was stunned with what she got out of my footage. She compressed it and gave you a sense of a buildup of tragedy that you otherwise wouldn't have.''         Other films she did with the Maysleses included ''Salesman'' (1969), an account of four real-life sales representatives of the American Bible Company, and ''Running Fence'' (1978), a chronicle of the successful efforts of the artist Christo and his wife, Jeanne-Claude, to erect a 24-mile fabric fence in the California hills.         Her own films included ''Thelonious Monk: Straight No Chaser'' (1989), which contained rarely seen clips of the brilliant and eccentric jazz pianist; ''Arshile Gorky'' (1982), a profile of the abstract painter; ''Sculpture of Spaces: Noguchi'' (1995); ''American Masters -- Ella Fitzgerald: Something to Live For'' (1999), a biography narrated by Tony Bennett; and ''Toru Takemitsu: Music for the Movies'' (1994), an examination of the Japanese composer. The Museum of Modern Art had a retrospective of her works last year.         Charlotte Mitchell was born on Aug. 15, 1931, in Detroit and developed her affection for film and music as a child by attending an entertainment event in Detroit called ''Big Band and a Movie.'' First came a live band, then the film, she said in an interview with The New York Times last year.         She attended Wayne State University, where she established a film society before moving to New York and finding work as a librarian at CBS for its documentary series ''The 20th Century.'' She slowly worked her way up to editor, then joined Drew Associates, where Robert Drew was pioneering ''direct cinema,'' as cinéma vérité was also called. She met the Maysleses at Drew.         She told The Times she stopped working with the Maysleses because they would not let her produce. ''They cast an awful long shadow, and it came time for me to get out of it,'' she said.         On her own films she became known for a personal signature characterized by innovative editing. Leonard Feather, a critic for The Los Angeles Times, said that her film on Monk provided ''a closer glance behind the veil of this half-hidden, exotically gifted figure than could ever be observed during his sadly aborted career.''         Ms. Zwerin was divorced from Michael Zwerin, a jazz critic. She is survived by her brother, Charles Mitchell, and sister, Margaret Tesone, both of Detroit.         Correction:  January 31, 2004, Saturday  An obituary of the documentary film maker Charlotte Zwerin on Tuesday misstated the location of the fatal stabbing of a fan at a 1969 Rolling Stones concert shown in ''Gimme Shelter,'' a film she edited. It occurred in front of the stage, not onstage.       
         Elizabeth Kenowsky Fisher, who with her husband, Zachary Fisher, helped bring the aircraft carrier Intrepid to its Hudson River berth as a floating museum, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Her death was announced yesterday by the Intrepid Foundation, which was founded by the Fishers and administers the annual Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Award for Patriotism. Mrs. Fisher had been suffering from Alzheimer's disease since 1990, the foundation said. Mr. Fisher died in 1999.         For many years, Mrs. Fisher was deeply involved in charitable work alongside her husband, a leading New York builder, especially to benefit the country's military, its veterans and their families.         Elizabeth Fisher, born in Allegheny County, Pa., was a Ziegfeld girl and served overseas with the United Service Organizations in World War II, helping entertain the troops, visiting the wounded in field hospitals and volunteering for the Veterans Bedside Network.         More recently, the Fishers provided financial support for families of military personnel lost in the line of duty. They started with the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut in 1983 and kept the effort alive through the Intrepid Fallen Heroes Fund. They began the Fisher House Foundation in 1990 to build ''homes away from home'' for families of hospitalized members of the military and the Fisher Armed Forces Scholarship Foundation to help active and former military personnel and their families.         The Fishers also gave money to the United States Naval Academy, and in the 1970's they led the campaign to refurbish the Intrepid and turn it into a floating museum, contributing millions of dollars to the effort. The Intrepid Sea-Air-Space Museum is berthed at Pier 86, at 12th Avenue and 46th Street.         Four years after Mrs. Fisher's Alzheimer's disease was diagnosed, the Fisher Medical Foundation joined David Rockefeller in providing $5 million for the Zachary and Elizabeth M. Fisher Center for Research on Alzheimer's Disease at Rockefeller University.         Mrs. Fisher is survived by a son, William Crovello of Manhattan.       
         Mary Jean Crenshaw Tully, a founding strategist of modern feminism and former president of the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense and Education Fund, died on Dec. 27 at White Plains Hospital. She was 78 and lived in Armonk, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, N. Linsey Tully.         Mary Jean Tully was an architect and mainstay of the feminist movement that regained momentum in the 1970's. She was most recently a board member and adviser of the Veteran Feminists of America, a gathering of the ''Second Wave'' of the movement.         She was a co-founder of the Westchester chapter of NOW and went on to head the group's national legal arm from 1971 to 1977.         From 1971 to 1981 she was president of the Fund for Women's Rights, founded by Betty Friedan to lobby for the Equal Rights Amendment and other women's rights issues. She founded the Midlife Institute at Marymount Manhattan College and directed it from 1981 to 1986.         In the late 1980's, Ms. Tully gave financial support to the Tully Crenshaw Feminist Oral History Project, which collects interviews with those active in the movement. It became part of the Schlesinger Library on the History of Women in America at the Radcliffe Institute at Harvard.         Ms. Tully started it as the History of NOW and Betty Friedan Project, and it led to reunions of those active in the organization's early days, which in turn gave rise to the Veteran Feminists of America, founded in her Manhattan apartment. Now based in Lafayette, La., it tracks the movement's early adherents and keeps them informed through a Web site, www.vfa.us.         Ms. Tully was also a founder and past co-chairwoman of the National Committee for Responsive Philanthropy and a founding member of the New York State National Women's Political Caucus.         Mary Jean Crenshaw, an Army brat, was born in Fort Sill, Okla., and educated at Stanford University, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of Chicago before she received a master's degree in sociology at Wayne State University. She raised five children and lectured in sociology at Long Island University, Brooklyn, for several years in the late 1960's.         Her involvement with social issues began in the late 1940's, when she was active in the N.A.A.C.P. in Schenectady, N.Y. In 1952, while living in Kansas, she began an association with the League of Women Voters.         Ms. Tully's 1947 marriage to C. Robert Tully, also of Armonk, ended in divorce in 1991. She is survived by three sons, Bruce C., of Manhattan; Scott P., of Pleasantville, N.Y.; and Andrew G., of San Francisco; two daughters, N. Linsey, of Manhattan and Laura L., of Lexington, Mass.; a sister, Carolyn Griffin of San Antonio; and six grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Holm Whalen, an Olympic swimming champion who was expelled from the 1936 Berlin Games in a headline-making drinking episode that brought her a second career as a slightly notorious but glamorous show-business figure, died Saturday at her home in Miami.         The cause was kidney failure, said her sister-in-law, Mary Ann Flotron.         By her own account, she would have been 90 at her death, but her sister-in-law said she was 91.         When she boarded the S.S. Manhattan in New York Harbor on July 15, 1936, with some 330 fellow Olympians bound for the Berlin Olympics, Eleanor Holm Jarrett, as she was then known, stood at the pinnacle of the swimming world. She had captured the 100-meter backstroke at the 1932 Los Angeles Games and had set world records in that event and the 200-meter backstroke. She had not lost a race in seven years and was the first female swimmer to be chosen for three American Olympic teams.         But when the ship docked at Hamburg, Germany, she was no longer a member of the Olympic team. The American Olympic Committee and its president, Avery Brundage, had expelled her from the Games for carousing and breaking curfew, an incident that became one of the most publicized flaps in Olympic history.         Her actions seem tame by modern standards, when sports pages have no shortage of accounts detailing drug abuse, criminal behavior and narcissism. But the tale of Olympic partying and drinking that emerged in 1936 enthralled readers who were hardly used to hearing about athletes' lives beyond the playing fields.         Eleanor Holm was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of a New York Fire Department officer, and learned to swim at the pool near her family's summer cottage in Long Beach, N.Y.         She finished fifth in the 100-meter backstroke at the 1928 Olympics in Amsterdam. Having won a gold medal in the backstroke at the Los Angeles Games in 1932, she was favored to repeat at the Berlin Olympics. But that was before she incurred the wrath of Brundage, the powerful American Olympic chief.         Holm was both a world-class swimmer and eminently worldly. She had married Art Jarrett, a bandleader, singer and fellow graduate of Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn, in September 1933. She had appeared with his band, wearing a white bathing suit and white cowboy hat with high heels, singing ''I'm an Old Cowhand.'' She had bit parts in several Warner Brothers movies.         Two days after the Olympians' ship left for the Berlin Games, Holm was invited to an all-night party for sportswriters on the first-class deck. Her drinking there and her violation of curfew brought a warning from Olympic officials.         Then, during a stopover in Cherbourg, France, she won a couple of hundred dollars playing dice with sportswriters aboard the ship during the afternoon. That night, she attended another party with them.         In an interview for ''All That Glitters Is Not Gold,'' by William O. Johnson, she remembered the moment:         ''This chaperone came up to me and told me it was time to go to bed. God, it was about 9 o'clock, and who wanted to go down in that basement to sleep anyway? So I said to her: 'Oh, is it really bedtime? Did you make the Olympic team or did I?' I had had a few glasses of Champagne. So she went to Brundage and complained that I was setting a bad example for the team, and they got together and told me the next morning that I was fired. I was heartbroken.''         According to ''The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics,'' by David Wallechinsky, the Olympic team doctor had reported that she was suffering from acute alcoholism, but Holm denied it.         Holm maintained that many of her fellow athletes had also been drinking on the voyage because there was no ban on alcohol, and some 200 team members petitioned Brundage to reverse the ban. But Brundage, who ruled amateur athletics in the United States for decades, stood fast.         ''I was everything that Avery Brundage hated,'' Holm said in ''Tales of Gold,'' by Lewis H. Carlson and John J. Fogarty. ''I had a few dollars, and athletes were supposed to be poor. I worked in nightclubs, and athletes shouldn't do that. I was married.''         She went on to recall: ''But he rained on my parade for only a very short time. He did make me famous. I would have been just another female backstroke swimmer without Brundage.''         While Nida Senff of the Netherlands was winning Holm's specialty, the 100-meter backstroke, with American entries finishing third and fourth, Holm joined her sportswriter friends. Hired by the International News Service to file reports on the Games, she became a celebrity presence in the press area, although her articles were ghostwritten.         She also attended receptions held by Hitler and other Nazi leaders. Hermann Goering, the Luftwaffe chief, gave her a silver swastika he took off his uniform. When Holm married Billy Rose, who was Jewish, she had it copied in gold and then placed a Star of David set in diamonds inside it.         After the Olympics, Holm continued in her singing act and was co-featured in the 1938 20th Century Fox movie ''Tarzan's Revenge,'' playing alongside Glenn Morris, the 1936 Olympic decathlon champion, who was cast as Tarzan.         After her divorce from Jarrett in 1939, Holm married Rose, who had obtained a divorce from the comedian Fannie Brice. Co-featured with Johnny Weismuller and then Buster Crabbe, Holm did 39 shows a week at Rose's Aquacade in the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940.         ''I thought I'd never be dry,'' she recalled in ''Tales of Gold.''         ''My hair turned green from the chlorine, and swimming on those cold October and November nights in New York was awful.''         Holm lived with Rose in a five-story, 14-room house on Beekman Place in Manhattan. They were divorced in 1954. She later married Tom Whalen, a retired oil executive, and settled in the Miami area.         She had no children and is survived by two nieces. Whalen died in 1984.         ''I don't swim anymore, I just play tennis,'' she told Dave Anderson of The New York Times in 1984. ''But I still have my 1932 Olympic bathing suit. It's blue with a red, white and blue shield on the front. It's long-waisted with a little skirt. And I don't drink Champagne anymore. Just a little dry white wine.''       
         Barbara Gamarekian, a former reporter on the arts and Washington society for The New York Times who was previously a press aide in the Kennedy and Johnson White Houses, died yesterday in Washington. She was 78.         The cause was peritoneal cancer, said a niece, Rachel Hughes.         Ms. Gamarekian arrived in Washington in 1957 to work on the legislative staff of Senator Hubert H. Humphrey.         She joined the presidential campaign staff of John F. Kennedy and was one of nine assistants to President Kennedy's press secretary, Pierre E. Salinger. She was in charge of photo and television coverage.         ''Ours was not the posh West Wing of television fame,'' she wrote in an article in The Times in 2001 that reflected the kind of observation she brought to her many articles about architecture.         ''The room sported harsh overhead lighting, government-issue furniture and limp, gray-green tie-backs on the windows.''         In 2001, she wrote an article for The Times on her experience in the Cuban missile crisis of 1962, telling of her surreal night in a bomb shelter under the East Wing that she had never known existed.         Last year, some of her other memories of the Kennedy White House were in the news when an interview she gave in 1964 for the John F. Kennedy Library came to light.         In it, she spoke of President Kennedy's romantic liaison with a college-age intern who could not type. Ms. Gamarekian told some details to the historian Robert Dallek when he was researching his book, ''An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963.'' The transcript, which Ms. Gamarekian had originally wanted sealed indefinitely, then became public.         ''Certainly it is something that I never discussed because if you are working for the administration, you feel a loyalty to it,'' she said of the affair in the library interview. ''It is the sort of thing you don't discuss, something you profess complete ignorance of when you attend the inevitable cocktail parties where this is the subject for discussion.''         Barbara Soellner was born Aug. 31, 1925, in Schenectady, N.Y.         In 1966, she was hired as an administrative assistant to the chief of the Washington bureau of The Times and eventually became a reporter specializing in cultural news in Washington.         Her subjects ranged beyond the Kennedy Center and National Endowment for the Arts to include a cookbook by Ralph Nader's mother and how men and women communicate. She became particularly known for her articles on what she called the movers and shakers of Washington. She retired from The Times in 1991.         Ms. Gamarekian, who was divorced, is survived by her brother, Glenn Soellner of Burnt Hill, N.Y., and her sister, Robin Hughes of Schenectady.         Her last article, which appeared in The Times in October, brought a light touch to her musings about losing her hair as a result of chemotherapy.         She said her penciled eyebrows gave her the look of an ''aging 1920's flapper.''       
         Jill Kornblee, an art dealer whose Manhattan gallery handled the work of many well-known contemporary artists early in their careers, died on Jan. 29 in Branford, Conn. She was 84 and lived in Weston, Conn.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Elisabeth Kornblee.         Born in New York City in 1920, Ms. Kornblee studied at Bryn Mawr College and later took art history courses at New York University's Institute of Fine Art. In 1961, with two partners, she bought the Barone Gallery on Madison Avenue near 79th Street. She soon took over her partners' interests and began operating the gallery under her own name.         An energetic dealer, receptive to new talent, Ms. Kornblee gave shows in the 1960's and 70's to a number of artists whose work is now well known. Among them were the British painter Howard Hodgkin, whose first solo exhibition in this country sold out at the gallery in 1973. Others included Dan Flavin, Malcolm Morley, Rackstraw Downes, Al Hansen, Janet Fish, Richard Smith, Peter Phillips, Mon Levinson and Michael Mazur.         She also had close friendships with other dealers, among them Leo Castelli, Ivan Karp, Allan Stone, John Bernard Myers and Betty Parsons. The Kornblee Gallery mounted several shows of work by Ms. Parsons, who was also an artist.         In the mid-1960's Ms. Kornblee moved the gallery to 58 East 79th Street, and in the late 70's to 20 West 57th Street, where it remained until she retired in 1986.         In addition to her daughter Elisabeth, who lives in Boston, Ms. Kornblee is survived by her husband, Dr. Leonard V. Kornblee of Weston; another daughter, Mary K. Gabriel, also of Boston; a son, John C. Kornblee of Rocky Hill, Conn.; and three grandchildren.       
         Lynn L. Seidler, the former executive director of the Shubert Foundation, which provides grants to support live professional theater and dance, died on Thursday while vacationing in the Turks and Caicos Islands. She was 67 and lived in Sanibel, Fla.         The cause was lung cancer, which was diagnosed a year ago, said her husband, Lee J. Seidler.         Ms. Seidler became the foundation's first director in 1975, turning it into one of the largest grant-making institutions for the arts in the country.         Under Ms. Seidler's leadership, the program took an unconventional approach to giving money. Instead of putting funds into bricks and mortar, she set Shubert grants aside for non-profit theaters, drama schools and dance companies in need of help with operating expenses.         The foundation currently distributes several hundred grants each year, ranging from $5,000 to $275,000. Last year it gave $13 million.         Ms. Seidler also founded the Shubert Archive. In 1976 she dusted off a trove of materials that for years had been sitting in boxes in the attics and basements of various Shubert theaters. With six million items, the archive is now one of the largest collections of theater memorabilia in the country.         Ms. Seidler retired from the foundation in 1994.         She was born Lynn Lopatin in New Brunswick, N.J., on Aug. 13, 1936. She received a bachelor's degree in liberal arts from Lake Erie College in 1958 and a master's degree in speech therapy from New York University in 1970.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her father, William Lopatin of Sanibel; a daughter, Laurie, of San Jose, Calif.; and a grandson.       
         Jane Engelhard, a philanthropist and art collector whose many gifts ranged from major donations to the Metropolitan Museum of Art to the Christmas crèche displayed at the White House, died on Sunday at her home in Nantucket, Mass. She was 86.         The cause was pneumonia, her daughter Annette de la Renta said.         As the wife of Charles Engelhard, owner of a vast international business empire, she helped Jacqueline Kennedy restore the White House, regularly made best-dressed lists and was such a fixture of New York society, its own magazines recounted, that socialites affectionately called her ''Our Mother Superior.'' After Mr. Engelhard's death in 1971, Mrs. Engelhard continued to display eclectic taste in her personal collecting, picking up rarities like the original presidential proclamation of the Louisiana Purchase as well as the perhaps predictable Monets.         Her gifts to the Met included the Charles Engelhard Court in the museum's American Wing in 1980. She was a trustee from 1974 until 1981, when she became a trustee emeritus.         She also gave to many smaller institutions, including the Newark Museum and the New Jersey Symphony, paying all of the salary expenses of the orchestra in some years.         Her contributions often went beyond money, as when she and Laurance S. Rockefeller and Brooke Astor in 1976 came up with the idea of planting a grove along the Potomac River to honor President Lyndon B. Johnson. From the administration of John F. Kennedy to that of George W. Bush, she served on committees to preserve the White House.         Jane Pinto-Reis Brian was born on Aug. 12, 1917, in Qingdao, China, where her father was serving as Brazil's ambassador. The family moved to Paris, where she was educated at the Couvent des Oiseaux.         Vogue reported that ''at 16 or so, black-eyed, confident and competent beyond her years,'' she married Fritz Mannheimer, a Dutch banker and, like Mr. Engelhard, thought to be one of the world's richest men. Eight weeks after they wed, Dr. Mannheimer died. The next day, his investment house closed, bankrupt.         She did inherit a microfilm company that copied United States war records and material for the Library of Congress, on whose board she later served. She was executive vice president of the microfilm company. After five years there, she married Mr. Engelhard, whose portfolio (ranging from gold, platinum, diamonds and timber to racehorses like Nijinsky II, a winner of the English Triple Crown) was once referred to as ''a consortium of conglomerates.''         They had houses in Johannesburg, in Maine and on the Gaspé Peninsula of Canada, and apartments in Manhattan, Rome and London. But they spent most of their time at their estate in Far Hills, N.J., where they kept champion golden retrievers and a pet lion roamed.         The Engelhards were active in Democratic Party politics. President Kennedy dispatched them as his representatives on diplomatic occasions.         President Johnson continued to send the Engelhards on diplomatic missions. But they proved even more useful as a bridge between Kennedy and Johnson loyalists.         In addition to Mrs. de la Renta, who lives in Manhattan and Kent, Conn., Mrs. Engelhard is survived by her four other daughters, Susan O'Connor of Missoula, Mont.; Sophie Craighead of Jackson Hole, Wyo.; Sally Pingree of Washington; and Charlene Engelhard of Concord, Mass.; two sisters, Brigitte de la Rochefoucauld of Paris and Madame Jacque Bemberg of Lausanne, Switzerland; 12 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Emily Morison Beck, the self-described literary archaeologist who edited three editions of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, mining sources from sea chanteys to Shakespeare, died on Sunday at her home in Canton, Mass. She was 88.         The cause was kidney failure, her son Gordon M. Beck said.         Mrs. Beck brought an august intellectual heritage, an elephantine memory and bristling energy to refining, enlarging and, sometimes, subtracting from a reference book that few libraries are without.         In the 13th, 14th and 15th editions, appearing in 1955, 1968 and 1980, Mrs. Beck gradually added feminist voices, the singers James Brown and Bob Dylan and the first words spoken on the moon, while remedying past omissions, like that of Dickens's ''Bah! Humbug!'' Excerpts from what she called ''members of the crappy poetry society,'' particularly those who favored nature poems, bit the dust. Robert Lowell was given a new and quite large voice in her Bartlett's. She expanded the entries from Shakespeare and the Bible, the staples since John Bartlett, a bookstore employee in Cambridge, Mass., decided to publish the quotations that he had been collecting in a notebook. But Mr. Bartlett might have been startled by a phrase from the Watergate scandal that appeared in the 15th edition, published in 1980: ''Expletive deleted,'' not to mention ''E.T., phone home.''         Some critics complained that the whole enterprise had become hopelessly arbitrary. Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1981, James Atlas compared the 15th edition of Bartlett's to the 10th anniversary issue of Rolling Stone.         ''It is strange to find on the stately double-columned pages words to songs I listened to while sitting in the parking lot of an A & W root beer stand on Friday nights in high school,'' Mr. Atlas wrote.         Others praised Mrs. Beck's boldness, even down to including an Emerson quotation criticizing quotations: ''I hate quotations,'' it reads, ''Tell me what you know.''         Mrs. Beck's extensive cross-referencing led to many refinements. For example, she traced Kaufman and Hart's ''You Can't Take It With You'' to the ancient Egyptians, the Bible and Theognis, a Greek poet.         Emily Marshall Morison was born on Oct. 15, 1915, in Boston, one of four children of Samuel Eliot Morison, the historian, and Elizabeth Greene Shaw. Newsweek noted in 1990 that she gave as much space to quotations from her father as to those from Herodotus and Thucydides.         Nicknamed Wendy after the character in Peter Pan, she was educated at the Dragon School in Oxford, England, the Concord Academy in Massachusetts and Radcliffe. She worked as an editor for Harper & Brothers and Alfred A. Knopf, and in 1946 married Brooks Beck, one of the first lawyers to represent authors in their negotiations with publishers. When he joined a law firm in Boston, she got a job with Atlantic Monthly Press, editing books.         In 1952 she was given a leave by Atlantic Monthly to help edit the centennial edition of Bartlett's, which was published by Little, Brown in 1955. In the preface she was cited for her ''highly competent and critical service'' but not singled out as the book's editor. During the preparation of that book, she wrote memo after memo, some of which made the case for keeping some of Shakespeare's most famous passages. She thus became the obvious choice to edit the next edition of the book, the 14th, which was published in 1968.         Her pursuit of the origins of quotations was dogged and often ingenious. In stalking a Henry James phrase she wanted to include in the 15th edition, she considered skimming his entire works, but chanced upon a magazine article about Truman Capote that attributed the lines to ''The Middle Years,'' an autobiography of James.         She read the entire book and could not find the lines. Then she noticed a little editor's note at the very end, saying James had taken the title from his short story of the same name. She got a complete collection of James's stories and found the quotation on the next to last page.         ''We work in the dark -- we do what we can -- we give what we have,'' it read. ''Our doubt is our passion, and our passion is our task. The rest is the madness of art.''         Mr. Beck died in 1969. Mrs. Beck is survived by her sister, Catharine Cooper, of Islington, England; her sons Cameron, of Canton, and Gordon, of Larchmont, N.Y.; her daughter, Emily M. Beck, of Larchmont; and three grandchildren.         Her helpers on Bartlett's ranged far beyond the academic experts hired by Little, Brown. The organist at her church told her that the correct title of Thomas Grey's poem was ''Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard,'' not ''Elegy in a Country Churchyard,'' as every edition since John Bartlett had claimed.         Mrs. Beck corrected the error in the 14th.         Correction:  April 1, 2004, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Emily Morison Beck, editor of three editions of Bartlett's Familiar Quotations, misspelled the surname of the poet who wrote ''Elegy Written in a Country Churchyard.'' (Its title had been misstated in Bartlett's, and Mrs. Beck corrected it on advice from the organist at her church.) The poet was Thomas Gray, not Grey.         The obituary also misstated the timing of the book's inclusion of the quotation ''E.T., phone home.'' It occurred after 1982, when the movie ''E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial'' appeared, not in the 1980 edition.       
         Mary Lindsay, who as John V. Lindsay's accomplished, blue-blood wife brought casual elegance and political acumen to his campaigns for New York City mayor and other offices while fiercely protecting the family's limited privacy, died yesterday in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, her daughter Margaret Picotte said. Mrs. Lindsay lived in Hilton Head, S.C.         Mr. Lindsay, who was mayor from 1966 to 1973, died on Dec. 19, 2000, at age 79.         Mrs. Lindsay, whose energy was suggested by her vigorous bicycle rides in Central Park and the countless coffee hours she held during her husband's campaigns, was her husband's most trusted adviser. James Reston described her in The New York Times as ''smarter than 16 Yale men,'' and Mr. Lindsay once volunteered that she was tougher than he was.         ''You can say anything in front of Mary,'' he said in a remark quoted by Vogue magazine in 1969. ''Besides, it'll save me having to tell her all over again.''         Mrs. Lindsay preceded Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis by three years at Miss Porter's School and Vassar and redecorated Gracie Mansion in the fine manner in which the first lady had made over the White House. But Mrs. Lindsay thought designer gowns were a waste of money and bought her clothes off the shelf in department stores. Reflecting her political sagacity, she explained that locally made clothes were a critical part of the city's economy.         Her never-disguised devotion to her children struck a responsive chord with many mothers.         ''I have a strict rule,'' she said in an interview with The New York Post in 1971. ''Nothing is scheduled for me after 4 p.m. That's when Johnnie comes home from school.''         She was also protective of her husband's most precious asset, time -- not to mention his peace of mind.         ''When he needs something done I may scream around the house,'' she said in a 1969 interview with The Times. ''But when he gets home, it's all peaches and cream.''         Mary Anne Harrison was born on Oct. 30, 1926, in Richmond, Va. Her father, Randolph Carter Harrison, was a senior vice president of Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company. Her mother, the former Mary Hawes, was president of the Garden Club of America.         She and her two brothers grew up in Greenwich, Conn. She enjoyed a tomboy's life, developing a reputation for independence. She needed only three years to graduate from Vassar in 1947 with a degree in psychology.         In her last year of college, she and John met when they were members of the wedding party of Nancy Walker Bush, sister of the former president George H. W. Bush, and Alexander Ellis. Mrs. Lindsay told The Post in 1965 that she first thought Mr. Lindsay was ''horrid'' because he did not pay any attention to her.         ''Later, when we knew each other a lot better, he said he had been assigned to be very nice to the groom's younger sister,'' she said. ''I now accept that.''         In 1948, in the kitchen of his parents' home, he asked her to marry him, she said. But he maintained he was only getting a beer.         ''He still says that,'' she said. ''But I know John. If he wanted to get out of something, he would have managed.''         Before her marriage she taught at the Mary C. Wheeler School in Providence, R.I., and at the Buckley School in New York.         They were married in June 1949 and moved into a $63-a-month apartment in Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan, according to Diplomat magazine. Mr. Lindsay was making $3,600 a year with his law firm. After the couple's first two children were born, they moved into a larger Stuyvesant Town residence that cost $83 a month. Eventually, they bought a $10,000 co-op.         She at first thought she would devote herself to being a homemaker. ''I thought it would be glorious,'' she said to The Post. ''Nothing to do but clean and be a good little housewife. I was bored to death.''         She soon got a job at a nearby nursery school until her first child, now Katharine Lake, of Connecticut, was born.         In addition to her, Mrs. Lindsay is survived by two other daughters, Margaret Picotte of Florida and Anne Lindsay of Massachusetts; her son, John Jr. of Connecticut; and five grandchildren.         The demands of motherhood were soon joined by the rigors of campaigning as Mr. Lindsay won three terms as a congressman from the city's ''Silk Stocking District,'' serving from 1959 to 1965.         She described their days at Gracie Mansion as ''beginning with chaos, ending with chaos and with a slight climactic middle.''         The verbal skills of the slender, green-eyed woman were suggested by her answer when asked how she felt when her husband was described as ''the creator of all urban evil,'' by The Post in 1971. She at first snapped that people who criticized Mr. Lindsay were ignorant.         Mrs. Lindsay quickly recovered.         ''Goodness,'' she said, ''criticism is part of our heritage. It's an important feature of this country.''         Robert Price, who helped direct Mr. Lindsay's four congressional races and first mayoral campaign, once gave Mrs. Lindsay the ultimate politician's compliment. He called her ''a political force more powerful than patronage.''       
         Frances B. Schreuder, a Manhattan socialite convicted in 1983 of persuading her teenage son to kill her wealthy father in Utah because of what she considered his stinginess, died on Tuesday at a hospice in San Diego. She was 65.         The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Marilyn Reagan, her sister, said. Ms. Schreuder (pronounced SHROY-der) lived in San Diego.         The murder of Franklin Bradshaw in Salt Lake City on July 23, 1978, provoked intense news coverage and led to two books, two television miniseries and, as recently as this year, a documentary on Court TV.         ''True crime is the hottest game in town,'' J. Anthony Lukas wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the two books, both published in 1985. One was ''My Mother's Request: A True Story of Money, Murder and Betrayal'' (Atheneum) by Jonathan Coleman; the other was ''Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder: A Family Album'' (Doubleday) by Shana Alexander.         ''This is 'Dallas' and 'Dynasty' come to life,'' Bill Wells, the director one of the miniseries, for CBS, said in an interview with The Times in 1986.         The crime indeed involved fascinating characters and plot twists. There was Ms. Schreuder, who bought $40,000 earrings at Tiffany's and sat on the board of the New York City Ballet. Mr. Bradshaw was one of the country's richest men and was known as Utah's Howard Hughes, but he bought his clothes at thrift shops and used a Coors beer carton as a briefcase.         Marc F. Schreuder, the grandson who shot Mr. Bradshaw in the back and head with a .357 Magnum, testified at his mother's trial that she had told him : ''Look, Marc, it is not really killing. It is the right thing to do for us.''         Frances Bernice Bradshaw was born on April 6, 1938, in Salt Lake City. She attended Bryn Mawr but was suspended in 1958 for stealing and forging checks and was told that she could return only if she received psychiatric help.         In the summer of 1958 she lived in Manhattan at the Barbizon Hotel for Women and met Vittorio Gentile, a pearl merchant, at Gino restaurant on Lexington Avenue. They married in 1959 at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and in 1960 had two sons, Lorenzo in February and Marco in December.         After the couple divorced, the sons were called Larry and Marc. Larry, who has changed his last name to Bradshaw, now lives in Los Angeles. Marc Schreuder lives in Provo, Utah. In addition to Ms. Reagan, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Schreuder is survived by a daughter from her second marriage, to Frederik Schreuder. She is Lavinia Schreuder of San Diego.         Mr. Coleman, the author, said in an interview that Frances Schreuder was skilled at manipulating her mother to get money, even as her father tired of supporting her extravagant life in New York. Her $360,000 donation to the New York City Ballet was the largest lump-sum contribution in the company's history up to that time.         At the time, news reports said she made contributions to the ballet and other New York causes, but Ms. Reagan said in an interview yesterday that Mrs. Schreuder's mother, Berenice Bradshaw, actually made most of them.         Mr. Bradshaw made his fortune by starting a chain of auto parts stores and acquiring federal oil and gas leases. Ms. Schreuder came to believe she might be disinherited, and her simmering resentment blossomed into a murder plot that at one point involved hiring what turned out to be a bogus hit man for $5,000.         The summer before the killing, when her sons went to Salt Lake City to work in their grandfather's company, she gave them poison to put in his food, Mr. Coleman said.         After the murder, the police first suspected a transient. But a year later, the murder weapon surfaced in Manhattan, and the police traced Marc Schreuder's journey days before the killing, to Utah by way of Texas, where he bought the murder weapon.         Although Mrs. Bradshaw spent $2 million on the legal defense of Marc Schreuder and his mother, Marc Schreuder was convicted of second-degree murder in 1982 and served 12 years in prison. Ms. Schreuder was convicted of first-degree murder the next year and was imprisoned for 13 years.         Marc Schreuder testified against his mother, saying she must be stopped, according to Mr. Coleman's book. ''I'm doing this for Lavinia,'' he said of his sister. ''Someone should care about Lavinia.''         Ms. Schreuder, who earned two sociology degrees while in prison, worked briefly for the Marriott Corporation in Salt Lake City before moving to San Diego. She inherited a comfortable income from her mother, despite family members' efforts to invoke a statute barring convicted killers from inheriting anything from their victims. A judge ruled that the law did not govern Berenice Bradshaw's choice of heirs.         Correction:  April 10, 2004, Saturday  An obituary on April 1 about Frances B. Schreuder, a Manhattan socialite convicted in 1983 of having arranged the murder of her father in Utah, misstated the time elapsed before the murder weapon was found and referred incorrectly to the college work she completed in prison. The weapon, a handgun, was found two years after the murder, not one. She earned a degree in psychology, not two in sociology. The article also misstated the title of a book about the case by Jonathan Coleman. It is ''At Mother's Request: A True Story of Money, Murder and Betrayal,'' not ''My Mother's Request.''       
         Janet Akyuz Mattei, an astronomer who studied variable stars, ones that wink and twinkle like cosmic eccentrics, and helped coordinate an international fan club that kept track of them, died on March 22 at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston. She was 61 and lived in Littleton, Mass.         The cause was acute myologenous leukemia, the American Association of Variable Star Observers in Cambridge, Mass., announced. Dr. Mattei, an international authority in her field, had been the group's director and staff astronomer since 1973.         The association, founded in 1911, collects and coordinates reports -- hundreds of thousands a year -- sent in by observers, many of them amateurs, from around the world.         Dr. Mattei was an expert who sorted variable stars by their characteristics, like the eruptive, cataclysmic type, or the pulsating variable with very slow and steady beat. The Sun, by comparison, despite its 11-year external sunspot cycles, is not counted among the variables. (It may become one as it decays, in a few billion years.)         The Web site of the association (aavso.org) advises that there are more than 30,000 variable stars known and catalogued for their changes in brightness, caused by internal forces that make them pulsate, shrink and swell. Thousands more are suspected of such behavior.         Dr. Mattei garnered information from some 600 observing posts, amateur and professional, operating large telescopes, both earthbound and mounted on space satellites. She analyzed the material, conducted visual and photometric studies of heavenly bodies, like dwarf novae, and kept the scientific community up to date on them.         She also made the association's database available to educators and helped amateur astronomers get their turn on the Hubble Space Telescope. In turn, she helped NASA select eligible amateurs in the 1980's and 1990's.         Dr. Mattei published about 180 papers on variable stars. She was the principal investigator for her association's education programs, financed by NASA, ''Partnership in Astronomy'' and ''Hands-On Astrophysics: Variable Stars in Math, Science, and Computer Education,'' which she also co-directed.         Janet Akyuz was born in Bodrum, Turkey. She came to this country as a Wein Scholar at Brandeis University, from which she graduated in 1965. She received two master's degrees in astronomy: from Aegean University in Izmir, Turkey, in 1970, and the University of Virginia in 1972, as well as a Ph.D. in astronomy in Izmir in 1982.         Before she became director of the variable-stars association, she briefly served as an assistant to her predecessor and taught physics and astronomy at the American College Institute in Turkey and Aegean University. She was also a teaching assistant at the Hayden Planetarium in New York in 1971 and a researcher at the Maria Mitchell Observatory in Nantucket in 1969.         Dr. Mattei is survived by her husband of 31 years, Michael Mattei; her mother, Bulisa Akyuz of Izmir; two brothers, Yusef Akyuz of Sudbury, Mass., and Hayim Akyuz of Izmir; and two sisters, Kadem Senkal of Istanbul and Beki Notrika of Tel Aviv.         Correction:  April 14, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on April 2 about Janet Akuyuz Mattei, an astronomer who tracked variable stars, gave an outdated name for the hospital in Boston where she died. It is Brigham and Women's Hospital, no longer Peter Bent Brigham.       
         Rosemary Park Anastos, an advocate for women's education and the liberal arts and a former president of Barnard College and Connecticut College for Women, died April 17 at her home in Los Angeles, said a niece, Joan Citron. She was 97.         Dr. Park, as she was known professionally, came from a family of academics: her mother was a teacher, her father and brother were also college presidents. When she left the Barnard presidency in 1967 after five years, she became the first woman to be a vice chancellor at the University of California. At her Barnard inauguration in 1963, she said that ''to avoid becoming a nursery school to the university with custodial and elementary responsibilities only,'' the college must make its liberal arts more sophisticated. She said that meant moving beyond acquiring facts to the mastery of subjects like advanced mathematics, political and economic theory and classical philosophy.         At Connecticut, where she was president from 1947 to 1962, she expanded the student body by one-third, strengthened the curriculum, built major new buildings and was a tireless fund-raiser. She made the campus a national center for modern dance and generally enhanced the college's reputation. When Yale gave her an honorary degree in 1958, it said she had been a major force in ''adding a bright star to the galaxy of liberal arts colleges for women.''         At Barnard, she followed a similar agenda, strengthening the curriculum, adding major buildings and raising money. But she left after five years, pulled by her marriage in 1965 to Milton Vasil Anastos, a professor of Byzantine Greek at the University of California, Los Angeles. He died in 1997. Dr. Park is survived by her stepson, Milton V. Anastos Jr., of Warwick, R.I., and several nieces and nephews.         Of her departure for California, David Truman, dean of Columbia College, wrote in Barnard's alumnae magazine that although she was the only woman at many Columbia meetings, her wisdom and humor gave weight to her advice and made her ''one of the best men in the university.''         Not all of her dealings with Columbia were harmonious, however, as she related in an interview with Helen S. Astin, a U.C.L.A. colleague, in ''The Higher Education of Women: Essays in Honor of Rosemary Park.'' When she proposed a new science laboratory for Barnard, she said, Columbia discouraged her, saying its labs were sufficient. But, she said, Barnard did not control those labs, and the absence of its own lab would send a signal ''that it didn't believe in science for women.'' Barnard built a new lab.         Born in Andover, Mass., Dr. Park was the oldest of four children of J. Edgar Park, a minister raised in Ireland who became president of Wheaton College, in Massachusetts, and Grace Burtt Park, who taught Greek and mathematics. Her brother, William E. Park, was president of Simmons College, in Boston.         She studied German at Radcliffe and graduated summa cum laude. She later studied at the University of Bonn in 1930 and in 1934 earned a Ph.D. at the University of Cologne. She began teaching German part time, first at Wheaton, then at Connecticut College, where she became dean of freshmen, academic dean, acting president, then president.         She spoke and wrote widely on education, the role of women and other topics, often breaking from conventional wisdom. She told parents that they should encourage their children to take courses in advanced mathematics and French, because society would need scientists and linguists. She said that schools facing teacher shortages should think about using television and older students to help with the teaching; both, she said, had proved effective.         She often leavened her seriousness with wit. In one speech, she took a swipe at English usage: ''At some point in most of the professions, the regrettable expression 'load' arose: case load, patient load, teaching load,'' she said. ''Artists, as far as I know, do not refer to picture load, poem load or concert load.''         Although she supported women's education, she was not a zealot. In her interview with Dr. Astin, Dr. Park said that women's colleges were ''particularly important for girls who develop slowly,'' but said men might benefit ''from the same kind of protective environment.'' She predicted that women's colleges would become less necessary, and she won authority to establish Connecticut College for Men and then admitted men as graduate students.         She was an energetic fund-raiser at a time when it was not always viewed as dignified. To raise $3.1 million for Connecticut College, she crossed the country, meeting with executives who questioned the need to finance women's education.         She became a vice chancellor at U.C.L.A. in 1967, and then a professor. In 1980, she helped develop the Plato Society, a U.C.L.A. study program for retired people. Until a few months ago, she was a member herself, taking courses like ''Romantic Composers'' and ''Brain and Memory.''       
         Winson Hudson, a civil rights campaigner in rural Mississippi who flaunted her contempt for Ku Klux Klan intimidation by wearing a bright red dress the many times she marched up to the courthouse to try to register to vote, died on April 24. She was 87.         Her grandson Kempton Horton said she died at a hospital in Jackson, Miss., that she had fought to desegregate.         In 1963, Mrs. Hudson brought the first suit to desegregate schools in a rural Mississippi county and won the case the next year. In 1965, a black child attended a previously all-white school.         She began trying to register to vote at the Leake County courthouse in 1937 and finally succeeded in 1962, but not before repeatedly having to write out and then explain a lengthy passage from the state Constitution. (White registrants merely had to explain this clause: ''All elections shall be by ballot.'')         In Mrs. Hudson's failed attempt to register in 1961, someone slipped a small card to her. It read: ''The Eyes of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Are Upon You.''         The next year, she dispensed with yet another abstruse constitutional passage, this time under the eyes of Robert F. Kennedy's Justice Department.         The Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed literacy tests and poll taxes. Mrs. Hudson soon signed up 500 new voters.         She became chairwoman of the county chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1961 at the urging of her friend Medgar Evers, the N.A.A.C.P. leader who was murdered in 1963. She kept the post for 38 years, fighting and winning battles to stop banks from prejudicial lending practices and bringing phones and paved roads to her poor county.         From inviting civil rights workers to sleep on her floor, to bringing Head Start to the community center she created, Mrs. Hudson achieved much -- but not national fame. Most histories of the civil rights movement do not mention her.         ''Mrs. Hudson was one of the unsung, unheralded heroes of the civil rights movement,'' Vernon E. Jordan Jr., who knew her as director of the Voting Education Project of the Southern Regional Council in the 1960's, said in an interview.         ''Her work represents the essence of what took place,'' he continued. ''There's a lot written about the leaders but not much about the contributions of the Mrs. Hudsons of the world.''         Bob Moses, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Mississippi field secretary in the 1960's, talked in an interview about the reign of terror of white supremacists whom he said wanted to eliminate the leadership of the N.A.C.C.P. He called Mrs. Hudson ''a part of that very small network of people who not only survived but actually found ways to struggle.''         He continued, ''It is inconceivable that the movement could have happened the way it did in Mississippi without these people.''         Last year, Mrs. Hudson said in an interview with The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., that it had been ''a lonely walk.'' But her fierce, righteous attitude was her armor. This was a woman who wrote her own funeral service.         ''The more they did to us, the meaner we got,'' she said in an interview for John Dittmer's 1994 book, ''Local People: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi.''         Mrs. Hudson looked the part, not least because she was big. Patricia Derian, who fought for integrated schools in Mississippi as a young mother and was an assistant secretary of state in the Carter administration, said in an interview, ''When she walked in a room, it was a little bit like having a battleship arrive.''         Ms. Derian added, ''When you gave her a hug she was soft, and that was all the soft you got out of her.''         Winson Gates was born in Harmony, in central Mississippi, on Nov. 17, 1916, the 10th of 13 children born to John Wesley Gates and Emma Kirkland, neither of whom ever tried to register to vote.         This family history was reported in the book, ''Mississippi Harmony, Memoirs of a Freedom Fighter'' (Macmillan, 2002), written by Mrs. Hudson and Constance Curry.         Mrs. Hudson was 8 when her mother died, and she and her siblings were raised by her father on a 105-acre farm until the land was seized by a white doctor to whom the family owed money.         A more sinister family memory, mentioned in an oral history by the Southern Regional Council, was her father's mentally ill brother being lynched by a white mob.         In 1936, Winson Gates married Cleo Hudson, whose family owned 500 acres in Harmony, a center of black property owners since Reconstruction. She went to work as a teacher at Harmony School and took on the additional chore of managing the lunchroom. The principal reprimanded her for giving free bread to hungry children.         During periods when her activism made it hard to get a job, she did manual labor. She said she could ''saw as much wood as any man.'' In civil rights work, she said she could do more than a man because a man would be in greater physical danger.         In 1937, Mrs. Hudson and her sister Dovie began a habit of going to the courthouse and trying to register ''for the heck of it,'' she wrote in the book. They conscientiously paid the poll tax, later outlawed, despite not being allowed to vote.         When Northern civil rights activists arrived to join local people in the Freedom Summer of 1964, she let the visitors sleep in her house, even after it was bombed. Her husband told James Chaney, a native of the area who would be killed with Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner that summer, not to go to Philadelphia ''because they'd kill you in Neshoba County.''         Mrs. Hudson is survived by her daughter, Annie Maude Horton, of Carthage, Miss.; her brother, Osly Gates of Portland, Ore.; two grandsons and three great-grandchildren.         Her legacy is also marked by Hudson Road, which runs near her house. In 1976, she mobilized the newly powerful black vote to at last pave the streets of Harmony. Before that, paving stopped at the town line.         Correction:  May 12, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Winson Hudson, a pioneer of the civil rights movement in Mississippi, misstated the year in some copies for the killing of the rights worker James Chaney, who had been warned by her husband against going to Philadelphia, Miss. It was 1964, not 1963.       
         Rita R. Fraad, a collector and patron of American art, died on Sunday at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 88.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her daughter Sara F. Henderson.         Starting in the late 1940's, Mrs. Fraad assembled a noted private collection of 19th- and 20th-century American art, from which she lent and donated to museums and galleries. Among her principal beneficiaries was her alma mater, Smith College, with its nationally respected art museum.         Others included the Brooklyn Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Smithsonian American Art Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she sat on the visiting committee on American art and sculpture.         She was also a trustee of the Archives of American Art, a part of the Smithsonian Institution that promotes research in the visual arts and amasses artists' papers and other memorabilia.         Rita Rich Fraad, a lawyer's daughter, was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from Smith College in 1937, a year before her marriage to Daniel Fraad Jr. Mr. Fraad had just joined the Allied Maintenance Corporation, a modest building service founded by his father in 1888.         While her husband built Allied Maintenance -- later Ogden Allied Maintenance -- into one of the country's leading fuel suppliers to airlines, Mrs. Fraad saw to their private art collection. It brought together works by Homer, Eakins, Sargent, Prendergast, Hassam, Bellows and Hopper, among others.         In her later years she focused on contemporary American works on paper and regularly gave them to the Smith College museum, either drawing works from her collection or buying them for the museum.         Mrs. Fraad was a member of the museum's visiting committee, an advisory panel, until last year. She established an endowment fund for American art at the Smith museum, where a sampling of her collection, called ''Realism Today,'' was exhibited in 1988.         Her husband died in 1987. Mrs. Fraad is survived by Ms. Henderson and another daughter, Dr. Martha F. Haffey, both of Manhattan; a sister, Janet Bradley of Tulsa; six grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Rosemary Breslin, a journalist and screenwriter who wrote a piquant memoir about her own stubbornly undiagnosable illness, died yesterday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47.         The cause was cardiac and renal failure associated with a blood disorder, family members said. Fourteen years ago, she began suffering increasingly serious bouts of what she thought was influenza but was later labeled an autoimmune blood disorder.         In the 1990's, Ms. Breslin and her father, Jimmy Breslin, the Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper columnist, both published books about their life-threatening illnesses and gave joint interviews about them.         Mr. Breslin's book, ''I Want to Thank My Brain for Remembering Me'' (Little, Brown and Company, 1996), was about his successful operation for a brain aneurysm. Ms. Breslin's book, ''Not Exactly What I Had in Mind: An Incurable Love Story'' (Random House, 1997), was about coping with regular and painful blood transfusions while also growing into a marriage and career.         In 1992, Ms. Breslin married Anthony Dunne, an independent builder of movie sets who later became a producer of documentary films. In 1993, while she was briefly a writer for ''NYPD Blue,'' Ms. Breslin was hospitalized for a month at U.C.L.A. Medical Center. She recovered and was able to write her book and, in 2000, help her husband establish an Internet venture, HauteDecor.com, a virtual interior design center that foundered, like many other Web ventures of the time.         In 2002, Ms. Breslin and Mr. Dunne won awards for two documentaries related to the aftermath of Sept. 11, 2001, ''Women of Rockaway'' and ''A Smile Gone, But Where?''         Ms. Breslin graduated from Hamilton College. In addition to her husband, father and stepmother, Ronnie M. Eldridge, a former City Councilwoman, she is survived by her sister, Kelly, and her brothers, James, Kevin, Patrick and Christopher.       
         Doris Dowling, who made an impression as a husky-voiced character actress in the film classics ''The Lost Weekend,'' ''The Blue Dahlia'' and ''Bitter Rice,'' died on June 18 in Los Angeles. She was 81.         Her death was announced by Lee Redmond, a family friend.         Ms. Dowling was the brunette sibling of a well-known blond actress of the era, Constance Dowling. The sisters appeared together when Doris made her Broadway debut in the 1940 hit musical ''Panama Hattie.''         She was back on Broadway briefly in ''Banjo Eyes'' (1941), ''Beat the Band'' (1942), ''New Faces of 1943'' and, later, in a revival of ''The Women'' (1973). But she spent the better part of her career in Hollywood and in Italy, where Constance had gone to work as an expatriate.         After an unheralded beginning in an earlier Raymond Chandler movie, ''And Now Tomorrow'' (1944), she made an auspicious appearance in ''The Lost Weekend'' (1945), an Oscar-winning film starring Ray Milland as an alcoholic. Ms. Dowling played Gloria, the available barfly with a heart whom he meets on his downward spiral.         In ''The Blue Dahlia'' (1946), a Raymond Chandler thriller starring Alan Ladd, she was the faithless wife who is murdered.         In Italy, Ms. Dowling took the part of Francesca, a gangster moll hiding among rice workers, in ''Riso Amaro'' (1949). The film gave the actress Silvana Mangano her sensational start and opened as ''Bitter Rice'' in this country in 1950.         Ms. Dowling made several more pictures in Italy and France, among them Orson Welles's version of ''Othello'' (1952), in which she played the small role of Bianca; Welles portrayed the Moor.         After returning to this country, she was a frequent guest star on television into the 1980's, and appeared often on the stage in Los Angeles.         Ms. Dowling was married three times. In 1952 she became the seventh of the bandleader Artie Shaw's eight wives. Her marriage to him was dissolved, but their son, Jonathan Shaw, survives, according to The Associated Press. In 1960 she married Leonard B. Kaufman, a television producer, who also survives her.         Constance Dowling died in Los Angeles in 1969. She was 49.       
         Myra Waldo, a writer who filled bookshelves with advice on places to see and their cuisines, died Sunday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 88 and formerly lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         Starting in the mid-1950's, Ms. Waldo wrote more than two dozen travel guides and cookbooks, which she periodically updated. Her ''Serve at Once: The Soufflé Cookbook'' of 1954, for instance, was revised as ''The Soufflé Cookbook'' in 1961 and, reissued in 1990, remains in print. A book she wrote in 1955 with the actress Gertrude Berg, ''The Molly Goldberg Cookbook,'' based on Ms. Berg's famous television character, was reissued most recently in 1999.         Myra Waldo was born in Manhattan and attended Columbia University. In 1937 she married Robert J. Schwartz, a lawyer, who died in 1997. She used her maiden name professionally.         Ms. Waldo worked on special projects for the Macmillan Publishing Company in the late 1960's. From 1968 to 1972, she was on the air as food and travel editor of WCBS radio, a job that led to her 1971 ''Restaurant Guide to New York City and Vicinity,'' which she continued to revise into the 1980's.         Her first book, as editor, was ''The Complete Round-the-World Cookbook,'' featuring recipes gathered by Pan American Airways (Doubleday, 1954, revised 1973).         There followed books about Roman, Northern Italian, Spanish and Asian food, about meals at restaurants that accepted the Diners Club card, and others about barbecues and desserts and cooking with wine. She wrote ''The International Encyclopedia of Cooking'' and ''The Dictionary of International Food and Cooking Terms'' (Macmillan, 1967).         Ms. Waldo's travel guides to Europe were each updated several times. She later added guides to South America, the South Pacific and Japan. She was a consultant to airlines and hotels.         Ms. Waldo is survived by her sister, Naomi Waldo Holtzman of Oakland, Calif.         Correction:  August 4, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on Thursday about Myra Waldo, an author of travel guides and cookbooks, gave an incomplete title for a book she wrote with the actress Gertrude Berg. It was ''The Molly Goldberg Jewish Cookbook,'' not ''The Molly Goldberg Cookbook.''       
         Phoebe Brand Carnovsky, an actress and distinguished acting teacher who was a founding member of the influential Group Theater, died on July 3 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan, her son, Stephen Carnovsky, said. She was 96.         Phoebe Brand, as she was known professionally, joined Lee Strasberg and others in 1931 to form the Group Theater, a radical company that dealt with social issues confronting the United States during the Depression. It was there that Strasberg advanced the Method approach to acting.         The Group presented the premieres of many plays by Clifford Odets, the troupe's resident playwright, and Ms. Brand played several roles, including that of Hennie Berger in Mr. Odets's masterpiece, ''Awake and Sing!'' She also starred in ''Golden Boy'' as Anna, the thoughtful sister of the hero, a sensitive boxer. The company disbanded in 1941.         Ms. Brand's husband, the Shakespearean actor Morris Carnovsky, died in 1992. In addition to her son, Stephen, of Los Angeles, she is survived by a niece, Katy Brand Dilkes of Cortland, N.Y., whom she raised.         Ms. Brand was born in 1907 in Syracuse and grew up in nearby Ilion, N.Y., where her father was chief mechanical engineer for Remington typewriters.         Petite and pretty, she got her professional start at 18 when the producer Winthrop Ames hired her to perform in a series of Gilbert and Sullivan revivals.         ''I played a lot of princesses,'' she would often say of her early career.         In the 1940's, the Carnovskys moved to Hollywood to work in film. But in 1952, Elia Kazan, a former member of the Group Theater, named them as Communists in the McCarthy hearings, and they were blacklisted. It was at this time that Ms. Brand began to teach acting technique.         In 1956, John Houseman broke the blacklist and asked Mr. Carnovsky to take part in the American Shakespeare Festival. In the early 60's, with her husband's career as an actor re-established, Ms. Brand helped found Theater in the Street, a troupe that toured neglected city neighborhoods and gave free outdoor performances of classic plays.         She made her film debut in 1994, at the age of 86, playing Marina in Louis Malle's ''Vanya on 42nd Street.''         Ms. Brand continued to teach acting technique until the end of her life. She held her last class a week before her death. The subject was her favorite: the plays of William Shakespeare.         Correction:  July 17, 2004, Saturday  An obituary of the actress and acting teacher Phoebe Brand Carnovsky on Monday misstated the forum in which the director Elia Kazan named her and her husband, the actor Morris Carnovsky, as Communists. It was the House Committee on Un-American Activities, not hearings conducted by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.       
         Anne Gorsuch Burford, a Colorado conservative who was chosen by President Ronald Reagan as his top environmental regulator only to resign under Congressional fire 22 months later, died Sunday in Aurora, Colo. She was 62.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Stephanie Gorsuch of Denver, said.         In appointing her administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, President Reagan made Ms. Burford a leader in his effort to bring economic discipline to environmental cleanup and to give the states greater enforcement powers on matters like clean air and water, policies she had earlier advocated on the state level. Critics contended that the policies weakened federal environmental enforcement to please polluting industries.         This fundamental difference in perspective reached a climax in a battle between a subcommittee of the House of Representatives, which demanded thousands of pages of documents relating to toxic waste cleanup, and Ms. Burford, who refused to hand them over. She said she would go to jail rather than surrender them to Congress.         Eventually, the White House gave up its claim of executive privilege to keep the documents secret, and Ms. Burford resigned on March 9, 1983.         In her tenure as the second-ranking woman in the Reagan administration, after the United Nations Ambassador Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, Ms. Burford showed sharp intelligence, as well as a taste for confrontation with environmental groups.         Environmentalists like Gaylord Nelson, chairman of the Wilderness Society, accused her of ''a wholesale dismantling'' of environmental advances, but Ms. Burford insisted that she was bringing cost-effective market forces to the regulation of pollution.         Anne Irene McGill was born on April 21, 1942, in Casper, Wyo. Her father, a surgeon, moved the family to Denver when she was an infant.         She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Colorado in two years and finished law school there at 20, then became the youngest woman admitted to the Colorado bar. She used a Fulbright scholarship to study criminal law in India.         She worked for a bank and then as an assistant district attorney for Jefferson County, Colo., and as deputy district attorney for the City of Denver. After working at two state regulatory agencies, she became a lawyer for Mountain Bell Telephone.         In 1976, she was elected to the first of two terms in the Colorado House of Representatives, where she was a member of a group that called itself the Crazies for its members' passionate devotion to states' rights and opposition to federal energy and environmental policies. She was named outstanding freshman legislator and worked on legislation concerning hazardous wastes and vehicle emissions.         In 1964, she married David Gorsuch, whom she divorced in 1982. The next year, she married Robert Burford, a rancher who was then head of the Interior Department's Bureau of Land Management. He died in 1993, while divorce proceedings were in progress. Ms. Burford returned to private law practice after her resignation.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her sons, J.J. Gorsuch of Denver and Neil Gorsuch of Vienna, Va.; her mother, Dorothy McGill of Denver; her sisters, Mary Edwards of Severna Park, Md., Theresa Peace of Lincoln, Neb., Dorothy McGill of El Paso, Tex., Veronica Urban of Santa Cruz, Calif., and Rosie Binger of Littleton, Colo.; a brother, Joe McGill of Plano, Tex.; and four grandchildren.         James Watt, who became Mr. Reagan's interior secretary, and James Coors, the Colorado brewing and energy magnate, sponsored Ms. Burford for the E.P.A. post. Her confirmation was held up for months as senators debated her qualifications and questioned her agenda, but the outcome was never in serious doubt.         When her nomination hearing was finally held on May 1, 1981, she began by speaking lyrically of her own environment.         ''As a long-term Coloradan,'' she said, ''I come before you with a deep appreciation of the unique beauties which we enjoy in our environment -- the majesty and grandeur of the Rocky Mountains, the openness and sense of space of our eastern plains.''       
         Yoko Watanabe, a Japanese soprano who was renowned for the gracefulness and intensity of her portrayal of Cio-Cio-San, the tragic title character of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly,'' died on July 15 at her home in Milan. She was 51.         A Japan Opera Foundation official announced her death to The Associated Press but did not give a cause. Miss Watanabe learned she had cancer in 2000.         Miss Watanabe was born in Fukuoka, Japan, in 1953 and early on, hoped to make a career as a dancer. She began studying Japanese dance when she was 3 and ballet when she was 6, but gave up dancing when her teachers said she was too tall and broad-shouldered for a professional career. She then took up the piano and became an accomplished player.         Miss Watanabe gave recitals until she was 18, but she was already thinking about the opera stage. When she was 16, she attended a performance of ''Madama Butterfly'' that, she said later, changed her life.         ''I knew immediately that I wanted to sing opera,'' she told The New York Times in 1988. ''When the performance was over, I went to the stage door and asked the soprano who sang Cio-Cio-San -- Kuniko Kozono -- to please teach me. And she did.''         From there, Miss Watanabe continued her studies at the University of Japan in Tokyo. A competition victory in 1976 took her to La Scala in Milan, where she continued her studies. Miss Watanabe had won second prize in that Tokyo competition. The first-prize winner was Renato Grimaldi, an Italian tenor whom she married and who survives her.         Another competition victory led to Miss Watanabe's professional debut, as Nedda in Leoncavallo's ''Pagliacci,'' in Treviso, Italy, in 1978. She made her La Scala debut in 1985 as Liù in Puccini's ''Turandot,'' and in her 20-year career she sang other major Puccini heroines as well as roles in works of Mozart, Verdi, Gounod and Bizet.         But the portrayal for which she was best known was Cio-Cio-San, the geisha who marries an American naval officer and is abandoned by him. It was as Cio-Cio-San that she made her debuts with the Royal Opera in 1983, the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1986, and the Metropolitan Opera in 1987.         Reviewing her Met debut for The New York Times, Will Crutchfield described Miss Watanabe's tone as having ''more metal than cream in it'' but praised her ''heartfelt portrayal'' and the subtleties of her characterization. Part of her success, too, came from the way she balanced Western and Japanese acting styles.         ''I am Japanese, and my figure is Japanese,'' she said, ''but the music is Italian, so I try not to do too much of what we would think of as Japanese theatrical movement. In Japanese theater, our movements are very small. We walk in small steps, we make small gestures. I don't believe those would really convey the character of Butterfly fully to the public. After all, this is a very dramatic opera.''         Miss Watanabe collapsed during a performance in December 1999 and retired a month later when her doctors diagnosed her cancer.       
         Ellen Auerbach, a photographer best known for innovative portraits and advertising images made during the Weimar Republic in Germany in the early 1930's, died on Friday at New York Weill Cornell Center , according to a friend, the artist Christine Graf. She was 98 and lived in Manhattan.         While in her twenties, together with her colleague and friend Grete Stern, the then Ellen Rosenberg formed a commercial photography studio in Berlin named Ringl & Pit. It was during the days of the liberal Weimar Republic, and they were intent on cracking what had been the male-dominated field of photography.         From 1929 to 1933 the two women collaboratively produced advertising, still lifes and studio portraits that reflected the energetic, experimental style of their mentor, Walter Peterhans, a professional photographer who taught at the legendary Bauhaus design school. Their pictures were part of a wave of innovation in European design and photography that today is referred to as the New Vision, and that temporarily erased distinctions between commercial and artistic motives in photography.         The partnership of Mrs. Auerbach and Ms. Stern produced offbeat, often humorous photographs, frequently of women, which were influenced by both Constructivism and Surrealism. One of their best-known advertising pictures, for a hair product called Pétrole Hahn, shows a lifelike female mannequin holding a bottle of lotion; only on close inspection is it clear that the hand in question belongs to a real woman. In their portraiture, they sometimes depicted their sitters with eyes closed or half shut, as if dreaming. In addition, they experimented with mirrors and with unusual camera angles in an attempt to disrupt familiar perspectives.         Relatively little of Ringl & Pit's work has survived, but it was reproduced and exhibited widely at the time it was made. In 1933, Mrs. Auerbach and Ms. Stern received first prize at an international exhibition in Brussels for ''Komol,'' an advertising still life constructed like a collage out of layers of paper, wire screen and artificial curls of hair.         Despite their success, the photographers closed their studio the same year, shortly after Hitler came to power. Weimar was finished. Ms. Stern and Mrs. Auerbach, who were both Jews, were among the fortunate few who realized what was happening. (''In a country with concentration camps, you cannot live,'' Mrs. Auerbach remembered, and they quickly left Germany.)         Mrs. Auerbach emigrated to Tel Aviv, London and, in 1937, the United States. Ms. Stern left for London and later Argentina.         Mrs. Auerbach continued her career as a photographer through the 1950's, although she gave up the rigors of the studio for more anecdotal and lyrical forms of documentation. She photographed the artists Fairfield Porter and Willem de Kooning with a casual directness in 1944, and in the mid-1950's accompanied Eliot Porter on a trip to photograph Mexican churches. But her interests were increasingly focused on children and the psychology of childhood development. In 1965 she began working as an educational therapist at the Educational Institute for Learning and Research in New York, where for 19 years she taught children with learning disabilities.         Ellen Auerbach was born Ellen Rosenberg in Karlsruhe, Germany, on May 20, 1906. After high school she decided to become an artist and studied sculpture for three years at an art school in Karlsruhe and, in 1928, at the Academy of Art in Stuttgart. While studying there her uncle gave her a camera, and it led her to abandon sculpture for photography, primarily because she thought she might earn a living. She sought out Walter Peterhans in Berlin, where he maintained a successful commercial studio, and asked to be his student. He agreed, and for these lessons Mrs. Auerbach was joined by another private student, Grete Stern.         The two young women quickly became fast friends. When Mr. Peterhans decided to shut down his Berlin studio and move to Dessau, they arranged to take over the premises and to operate as Ringl & Pit. According to the photographers, the studio name was simply a combination of their childhood nicknames: Grete Stern was called Ringl and Ellen Rosenberg was called Pit. But in addition, the name had the advantage of being ambiguous in terms of gender and ethnicity.         When the rise of Hitler forced the women to dissolve their partnership in 1933, Ms. Stern moved to London and opened a studio there. Mrs. Auerbach and her future husband, Walter Auerbach, a stage designer and photographer, moved to Tel Aviv, then part of Palestine, and opened a studio specializing in portraits of children. The Auerbachs were divorced in 1945. Ms. Stern died in 1999, in Buenos Aires, at age 94. Mrs. Auerbach has no immediate survivors.         Interest in her early work from the Ringl & Pit studio was kindled in this country in the 1980's, when museum curators and private collectors began to research European Modernism of the 1920's and 1930's. The San Francisco Museum of Modern Art added two Ringl & Pit prints to its collection in 1983 and in 1987 reproduced them in the book, ''Photography: A Facet of Modernism.''       
         Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the psychiatrist whose pioneering work with terminally ill patients helped to revolutionize attitudes toward the care of the dying, died Tuesday at her home in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 78.         She died after losing consciousness last week, according to her son, Kenneth. She had recently suffered a series of infections. As she neared her own death after debilitating strokes in the late 1990's, Dr. Kübler-Ross appeared to accept it, as she had tried to help so many others to do.         ''I always say that death can be one of the greatest experiences ever,'' she wrote in an autobiography in 1997. ''If you live each day of your life right, then you have nothing to fear.''         Dr. Kübler-Ross was credited with helping end centuries-old taboos in Western culture against openly discussing and studying death. She also helped change the care of many terminally ill patients to make death less psychologically painful, not only for the dying, but also for their doctors and nurses -- and not least for the survivors.         Although the care she sought is by no means universal, she profoundly changed the way the medical profession is asked to look at death. Her greatest influence came through her writings, especially her 1969 best-seller, ''On Death and Dying,'' which remains in print around the world.         She also gave many lectures and distributed tape recordings of them, conducted extensive research into what she described as the five stages of death based on thousands of interviews with patients and health care professionals and did groundbreaking work in counseling dying patients.         She was a powerful intellectual force behind creating a hospice system in the United States through which palliative care and psychological support are provided for many terminally ill people. And she helped to turn thanatology, the study of physical, psychological and social problems associated with dying, into an accepted medical discipline.         ''Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was a true pioneer in raising the awareness among the physician community and the general public about the important issues surrounding death, dying and bereavement,'' Dr. Percy Wooten said when he was president of the American Medical Association in 1998.         Dr. Wooten said her work was part of the basis for the A.M.A.'s efforts to encourage the medical profession to improve care at the end of life.         The A.M.A was one of her early supporters, though many of its members at first vigorously opposed her.         In the later part of her career, she embarked on research to verify the existence of life after death, conducting, with others, thousands of interviews with people who recounted near-death experiences, particularly of those declared clinically dead by medical authorities but later revived.         Her prestige generated widespread interest and devoted followers.         The work aroused deep skepticism in medical and scientific circles. Her assertions that she had evidence of an afterlife saddened many colleagues, some of whom said she had abandoned rigorous science and had, perhaps, succumbed to her own fears of death.         ''For years, I have been stalked by a bad reputation,'' she wrote in her 1997 autobiography, ''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying.'' ''Actually, I have been pursued by people who have regarded me as the Death and Dying Lady. They believe that having spent more than three decades in research into death and life after death qualifies me as an expert on the subject. I think they miss the point. The only incontrovertible fact of my work is the importance of life.''         Whatever scientists think about her views of life after death, they continue to be influenced by her methods of caring for the terminally ill. Before ''On Death and Dying,'' terminally ill patients were routinely left to face death in a miasma of loneliness and fear, because doctors, nurses and families were generally ill equipped to deal with death.         Dr. Kübler-Ross changed that for many, though by no means for all, dying people. By the 1980's, the study of dying became part of medical and health-care education in United States. ''Death and Dying'' became an indispensable manual, both for professionals and family members.         Weighing barely two pounds at birth, Elisabeth Kübler was the first of triplets born to Ernst and Emma Villiger Kübler on July 8, 1926, in Zurich.         By the sixth grade, she wanted to be a doctor. But her father angrily opposed the plan, telling her she could resign herself to being his secretary in the office supply business that he managed or spend the rest of her life as a maid.         ''That's all right with me,'' she said she replied.         After her schooling, she volunteered at the largest hospital in Zurich to help refugees from Nazi Germany. When World War II ended, she hitchhiked through nine war-shattered countries, helping open first-aid posts. In Poland, her visit to the Maidanek death camp narrowed her professional goal. She would become a psychiatrist to help people deal with death.         She received her medical degree from the University of Zurich in 1957. Within a year, she moved to the United States; married Dr. Emanuel K. Ross, an American neuropathologist she had met at the university; began her internship at Community Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y.; and become a research fellow at Manhattan State Hospital.         At the hospital, she was appalled by what she called the routine neglect and abuse of dying patients. After badgering her supervisors, she was allowed to develop programs under which to give the patients individual care and counseling.         In 1962, she became a teaching fellow at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. A small, outwardly shy woman who spoke with a heavy German accent, she was nervous when asked to fill in for a popular professor and master lecturer. At first, she was ignored.         But the hall became noticeably quieter when she brought out a 16-year-old patient who was dying of leukemia and asked the students to interview her. Now it was they who seemed nervous.         When Dr. Kübler-Ross prodded the students, they asked the patient about blood tests, chemotherapy and other clinical questions. Finally, the teenager exploded in anger and began posing her own questions.         What was it like not to be able to dream about the high-school prom? Or going on a date? Or growing up? ''Why won't people tell you the truth?'' she demanded.         When the lecture ended, many students had been moved to tears.         ''Now you're acting like human beings, instead of scientists,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross said.         Her lectures began to draw standing-room-only audiences of medical and theology students, members of the clergy and social workers -- but few doctors.         In 1965, Dr. Kübler-Ross became an assistant professor in psychiatry at the University of Chicago Medical School, where a group of theology students approached her for help in studying death. She suggested a series of conversations with dying patients, who would teach the professionals.         At first, staff doctors objected to the program, arguing that patients should be shielded from thoughts of death. Avoiding the subject entirely, particularly when treating the young, physicians and therapists would meet a dying child's questions with comments like, ''Take your medicine, and you'll get well,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross wrote in ''On Death and Dying,'' which incorporated her account of the Chicago seminars.         She said that children instinctively knew that the answers they received about their prognoses were lies and that the deceit made them feel punished and alone. With an associate, the Rev. Carl Nighswonger, she interviewed dying patients at Billings Memorial, the university's teaching hospital, while the theology students observed from a one-way glass. The terminally ill were eager to talk.         To bring public pressure to change hospital standards, she agreed to a request by Life magazine in 1965 to interview a seminar patient, Eva, who said that her doctors had treated her arrogantly. The Life article angered the hospital administrators, who said the hospital wanted to be famous not for its dying patients, but rather for those it saved. Doctors were ordered not to cooperate further, and the lecture hall for her next seminar was empty.         But the hospital switchboard was overwhelmed with calls in reaction to the article; mail piled up, and Dr. Kübler-Ross was invited to speak at other colleges and universities.         As for Eva, Dr. Kübler-Ross recounted, she ended up dying cold and alone. Gradually, the medical profession moved toward accepting new approaches to treating the terminally ill, although living wills and patient care directives do not always prevent patients from being subjected to neglect or to invasive medical care at the end of life.         From her patient interviews, Dr. Kübler-Ross identified the five now famous stages that many patients go through in confronting their deaths. Often, denial is the first stage. As his condition worsens and denial is impossible, the patient displays anger, the ''Why me?'' stage.         That followed by a bargaining period. ''Yes, I'm going to die, but if I diet and exercise can I do it later?'' When the patient sees that bargaining will not work, depression often sets in.         The final stage is acceptance, a period in which the patient is ready to let go.         Not all dying patients follow the same progression, Dr. Kübler-Ross said, but most experience two or more stages. Moreover, she found, people who are experiencing traumatic life changes like divorces often experience similar stages. Another conclusion she reached was that the acceptance of death came most easily for people who could look back and feel that they had not wasted their lives.         Among the patients whom she interviewed in the late 60's was a woman, Mrs. Schwartz, who had been pronounced dead but hours later was found by a nurse to be alive. Dr. Kübler-Ross said Mrs. Schwartz was able to repeat conversations of others that occurred around her when she was clinically dead, including a joke told by a doctor. Doctors and medical students called the episode a hallucination, but Dr. Kübler-Ross thought it merited further investigation, and she began to an effort to verify existence after death.         At a psychiatric workshop, she was quoted as saying: ''I know for a fact that there is life after death,'' and promptly received a barrage of criticism from scientists. The disapproval, plus what she called institutional politics, caused her to leave hospital work in 1973.         By then, she was receiving requests from around the world to give seminars on death and dying, and she began to speak at workshops for the dying about what she called ''life after life,'' a happy condition in which physical pain and mental anguish are absent.         She and associates talked to thousands of patients like Mrs. Schwartz and said they found common strains in the interviews. Patients reported that their experiences after clinical death were remarkably free of pain; that they were aware of precisely where they were at death and of seeming to float out of their bodies; that they seemed not to be suddenly alone but still with family members or friends; that they felt as if they were guided to a place of psychic energy, light, love and warmth greater than any they knew in life; and that they did not want to return.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross became increasingly interested in spiritual phenomena, she sought her own out-of-body experience. Robert Monroe, an engineer from Virginia who wrote ''Journeys Out of the Body,'' invited her -- at a time when, as it turned out, she was seriously ill with a bowel obstruction -- to participate in experiments with a group of physicians, psychiatrists from the Menninger Foundation and engineers. She lay on a waterbed in a small laboratory, connected with polygraphs and earphones through which she heard tapes of waves, as she was instructed on how to relax.         ''I was on the ceiling,'' she recounted. ''I was so excited that you couldn't believe it. It was really the highlight of my life.''         She repeated the experiment, and she said her illness disappeared.         In her lectures, she began describing more of her out-of-body experiences, some of which she said were at first terrifying but ultimately uplifting. She also talked of encountering spirit guides, including Mrs. Schwartz, who, she said, appeared 10 months after her death and told Dr. Kübler-Ross to continue her work, promising, ''We will help you.''         In the late 70's, Dr. Kübler-Ross built a center on 42 acres in the hills of Escondido, Calif., where she and others could ''expound theories of survival of the spirit after death in the form of a living entity.''         When skeptics challenged her accounts of spirit guides, she said people in the modern age had difficulty accepting them, because they ''are no longer in touch with their own spirituality.''         In 1976, she fell under the sway of Jay Barham, a former Arkansas sharecropper who had founded the Church of the Facet of Divinity and said he was able to channel spirits and communicate with them. Dr. Kübler-Ross talked about setting up a worldwide network of franchised centers with him and his wife to counsel on the problems of dying and living. His program was investigated by the San Diego district attorney's office because of accusations of sexual misbehavior. She severed ties with him, and years later acknowledged that she had been mistaken about him and that he had deceived many people.         Dr. Kübler-Ross's reputation was seriously damaged, and her credibility waned. Moreover, her channeling sessions, combined with a heavy travel schedule, contributed to the breakup of her marriage, and her husband left her in 1979.         Her center in California burned, and the police suspected arson. In 1984, she set up another center, in Virginia, to care for children with AIDS. That center also burned, in 1994, and again arson was suspected. After the second fire, she moved to Scottsdale to be near her son, Kenneth, a freelance photographer.         That year, when Dr. Ross was dying, he moved to a condo in Scottsdale near Dr. Kübler-Ross, and she and Kenneth cared for him. Dr. Kübler-Ross is also survived by a daughter, Barbara Ross Rothweiler, a clinical psychologist, of Wausau, Wis.; and one of her triplet sisters, Eva, of Basel, Switzerland; and two granddaughters.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross's health failed in the late 90's, she acknowledged that she was in pain and ready for her life to end. But she said: ''I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no death the way we understood it. The body dies, but not the soul.''       
         Helen K. Copley, former publisher of The San Diego Union-Tribune and its predecessors and a prominent philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in La Jolla, Calif. She was 81.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the newspaper said.         Mrs. Copley began working at the Union Tribune Publishing Company as a secretary in 1953. She became the publisher in 1973, taking the position after the death of her husband, James S. Copley. She retired in 2001.         Until 1992, the company's two flagship newspapers, The San Diego Union and its afternoon sister paper, The San Diego Tribune, were the major competing papers in the city. Responding to declining circulation numbers and a drop in advertising, Mrs. Copley merged the two papers into The Union-Tribune, a morning paper. It is now the third-largest newspaper in California, with a daily circulation of 355,000. The Sunday circulation is 445,000.         As the population grew in San Diego, Mrs. Copley dealt with growing competition from smaller papers and a regional edition of The Los Angeles Times. In her first years as publisher, she sought to meet with all 1,500 employees of the company in small groups in an effort to improve morale. Under her tenure, The San Diego Tribune won two Pulitzer prizes.         Copley Press Inc., which owns the Union-Tribune Publishing Company, publishes eight other daily newspapers, in California, Illinois and Ohio. Keeping Copley Press in family hands was a priority for Mrs. Copley, and she turned it over to her son, David C. Copley, when she retired.         Margaret Helen Kinney was born in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, on Nov. 28, 1922. After a stint in the Waves in the 1940's and a brief marriage, she moved to San Diego with her mother in 1951.         In 1953, Mrs. Copley answered an ad for a job at the Union Tribune Publishing Company. She began working as a secretary for Mr. Copley, who had become chief executive of Copley Press after the death of his father, Ira C. Copley, who started the company in 1905. In 1965, she married Mr. Copley; eight years later, he died of brain cancer.         Mrs. Copley, whose worth was estimated to be $960 million by Forbes magazine last year, gave millions to the San Diego Symphony and the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art. She also underwrote the construction of a library at the University of San Diego.         In addition to her son, David, of La Jolla, Mrs. Copley's survivors include a sister, Mary Frances Davison of Santa Maria, Calif.; a brother, Frank E. Kinney of Cedar Rapids; and two stepchildren from her husband's first marriage, Michael Copley of San Diego and Janice Obre of New York.       
         Gloria Emerson, a journalist and author who wrote with angry dignity about the effects of war on Americans, Vietnamese and Palestinians, was found dead by friends and the police yesterday morning in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 75 and left no immediate survivors.         The medical examiner's office said that it had not ruled on the cause of death. Her physician, Karen Brudney, said Ms. Emerson had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, which she feared would leave her unable to write, and she left many notes at the apartment indicating that she had taken her own life.         Both as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times in Vietnam in the early 1970's and later as a writer of nonfiction books and a novel, Ms. Emerson wrote passionately about ordinary people and soldiers ground up by the machinery of war in places like Vietnam, Gaza and Algeria.         War as she wrote about it was not ennobling but debasing, a misery that inflicted physical suffering and psychic damage on civilians, children, and soldiers on both sides. Her literary model was Graham Greene, whose dark portrayal of the early days of the American war in Vietnam influenced her articles and her style. ''Loving Graham Greene'' was the title she gave her novel, published by Random House in 2000.         She was working in the London bureau of The Times in 1969 when, as she wrote in an obituary she left with a covering note that was dated Tuesday, ''Ms. Emerson requested that she be sent to Vietnam because she had been in that country in 1956 and wanted to go back to write about the Vietnamese people and the immense unhappy changes in their lives, not a subject widely covered by the huge press corps who were preoccupied with covering the military story.''         Her articles from Vietnam, many reported with the help of Nguyen Ngoc Luong, her interpreter, brought alive for many readers people who had been an abstraction, the Vietnamese whose ''hearts and minds'' the United States went to war to win, but lost to communist adversaries who prevailed despite millions of casualties.         One of her articles after the unsuccessful South Vietnamese attempt to cut off North Vietnamese supply lines in Laos in 1971 reported how Sergeant Co, an infantry platoon leader, clung to the skids of an American helicopter to get out alive. '''Each helicopter could have been the last one, so what choice was there for me?' he asked. 'Only the madmen would stay and politely wait for the next helicopter.'''         Her literary voice was always gravely serious. In person, she was well dressed, precise in speech and eccentrically funny.         She was constantly giving money to veterans, refugees and street beggars. She could be possessive and domineering, especially toward the photographers whose work she thought would outlast her articles published with them; the words she compared to ice cubes that melted in the sun.         As Ms. Emerson put it in her own obituary: ''Her dispatches from Vietnam won a George Polk Award for excellence in foreign reporting, and, later, a Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications. Her nonfiction book on the war, 'Winners & Losers' (Random House, 1977), won a National Book Award in 1978 but she described it as 'too huge and somewhat messy.' Its subject was the effects of the conflict on some Americans, or 'an absence of the effect,' as she once said.''         Typical of ''Winners & Losers'' were lines like these, about Joseph (Teddy) Humber Jr., who lost both his legs in a mine explosion in Vietnam in 1972 and came home to his family in Westboro, Mass. ''Teddy did not seem to always know what the others were saying,'' she wrote. ''He seemed busy with something else; perhaps it was pain. He sat at the table without moving, often without hearing.''         Another book in 1985, ''Some American Men,'' published by Simon & Schuster, ranged further into the souls of her countrymen and their afflictions in sports and love as well as in war. ''Gaza, a Year in the Intifada,'' about a year she spent with Palestinians in what she called ''an occupied land,'' was published by The Atlantic Monthly Press in 1991.         ''Made to feel inferior, treated with contempt and cruelty, the Gazans struggled to transcend their own feelings of helplessness,'' she wrote then.         ''The book provoked hostility among friends, and others felt it was anti-Israel, but Ms. Emerson insisted this was not the reason for writing it,'' she explained later, in the obituary she left behind. ''She hoped to provide a primer for those who felt the situation in the Middle East was too complicated or too controversial to understand.''         Born in New York City to William B. Emerson and Ruth Shaw Emerson in 1929, she began her career in The Times's women's news department in 1957, describing herself on her application as a widow, giving her married name as Znamiecki.         ''I applied for a job at The New York Times many years ago, and felt correctly that my life depended on it,'' she explained in a note written just before her death. ''I didn't go to college, I ran away from an alcoholic wretched home and went to work on a hotel giveaway magazine.'' She continued, ''Getting a job on the women's page was a gift from heaven although I hated writing about shoes and clothes, all under the eye of the advertising department who measured editorial mention of retailers. You cannot imagine what it was like in those days.''         She left the paper in 1960 to live in Brussels with Charles A. Brofferio, whom she described as ''an ill-suited husband'' she divorced a year later.         The Times hired her back as a reporter in Paris in 1964 ''on the understanding that I would cover the haute couture collections twice a year,'' she explained. Moving to the paper's London bureau in late 1968, she made her way to Belfast to write some articles about the conflict in Northern Ireland, and in 1970, as she put it, ''I was allowed to go to Vietnam because the war was supposed to be over so it didn't matter if a female was sent. Et voilà!''       
         Julia Child, who turned the art of French cooking into prime-time television entertainment and brought cassoulet to a casserole culture in the two volumes of her monumental ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' died yesterday at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif., two days before her 92nd birthday.         The cause was complications of kidney failure, said a niece, Philadelphia Cousins.         Mrs. Child was a towering figure on the culinary front for more than 40 years. Most Americans knew her as the imperturbable host of the long-running PBS television series ''The French Chef.'' She was a tall, exuberant woman who could make lobster bisque look as easy as toast. But she was also respected by food professionals for the clarity and rigor with which she translated French cuisine for an American audience, most impressively in ''Mastering the Art of French Cooking,'' a work that Craig Claiborne, in The New York Times, said ''may be the finest volume on French cooking ever published in English.''         Mrs. Child was not the first dedicated cook to turn cooking into a spectator sport -- James Beard preceded her on television in 1945, Dione Lucas in 1948 -- but she brought a fresh, breezy approach to daunting material, expressed in her up-the-scales signature signoff, ''Bon appétit!''         ''She demystified French cuisine in a way that had not been done before, in an appealing, straightforward way,'' said Jacques Pépin, who teamed up with Mrs. Child in the cooking series ''Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home.''         A self-confessed ham, she became a darling of audiences and comedians almost from the moment she made her debut on WGBH in Boston in 1963 at the age of 50. On ''Saturday Night Live,'' Dan Aykroyd played her boozily bleeding to death while shrieking, ''Save the liver.'' Jean Stapleton even portrayed her in a musical with sung recipes called ''Bon Appétit!'' in 1989.         ''I fell in love with the public, the public fell in love with me, and I tried to keep it that way,'' Mrs. Child said in an interview last year.         What made Mrs. Child such an influential teacher was her good-humored insistence that competent home cooks, if they followed instructions, would find even complicated French dishes within their grasp. Mistakes were not the end of the world, just part of the game.         In fact, minor slips and mishaps were weekly events on ''The French Chef,'' and none of them seemed to faze Mrs. Child. At the same time, she always put the food before showmanship. She had real respect for recipes, and by example she helped elevate the status of cooking in the United States.         Beginnings of an Outsize Life         Julia Carolyn McWilliams was born Aug. 15, 1912, in Pasadena, Calif. Her father was a wealthy farm consultant and investor; her mother was a housewife with a cook and maid who could make not much more than baking powder biscuits, codfish balls and Welsh rarebit. Julia was the oldest of three siblings, each so tall that their mother boasted that she had ''given birth to 18 feet of children.'' Otherwise, she gave no indication that she would lead an outsize life.         She attended Smith College at a time when ''women could be either nurses or teachers,'' she said, and she had some vague idea of being a novelist or a basketball star. After graduation in 1934 and a stint as a copywriter in between cocktail parties in New York, she returned home. According to her biographer, Noel Riley Fitch, in ''Appetite for Life'' (Doubleday, 1997), her one real job in her hometown, in advertising and public relations, ended when she was fired for insubordination, and rightly so, she always said.         After World War II broke out, she signed up for intelligence work with the Office of Strategic Services, hoping to become a spy, but was sent off as a file clerk to Ceylon. There she met Paul Child, the head of a chart-making division who was 10 years older and several inches shorter. He was also an artist, a poet and a serious food lover who opened up her taste horizons on their travels in China.         They married in 1946 and spent a year in Washington before Mr. Child was sent to Paris by the United States Information Agency. It was a fateful move, because Mrs. Child by then was struggling to learn to cook and her husband was suffering the consequences. French food immediately took her attempts to a higher plane. Out of those early experiments came her core belief: that cooking was an art to be studied, not picked up on the fly.         She threw herself into studies at the Cordon Bleu and later joined the Cercle des Gourmettes, a club where she met Simone Beck and Louisette Bertholle, two cooking enthusiasts who wanted to write a cookbook for the American market but lacked the English to do it. The three became partners in a cooking school they called L'École de Trois Gourmandes in Paris and set to work on their cookbook, even as Mrs. Child followed her husband to postings in Marseille, Bonn and Oslo. In 1956 the couple took up residence in Cambridge, Mass. They continued to visit Europe frequently, maintaining a home near Grasse, in the south of France.         After nearly a decade, Mrs. Child and her partners produced an 800-page manuscript that Houghton Mifflin, the publisher that had originally contracted for it, rejected as too daunting. Judith Jones at Alfred A. Knopf read a later, more comprehensive version and decided it was the detailed, lucid, approachable French cookbook that she, and all of America, had been waiting for.         ''I was jealous,'' said Mr. Pépin, who met Mrs. Child in 1960 and saw the book in manuscript. ''It was just the kind of book I would have liked to do.''         The introduction showed Mrs. Child at her most direct: ''This is a book for the servantless American cook who can be unconcerned on occasion with budgets, waistlines, time schedules, children's meals, the parent-chauffeur-den mother syndrome or anything else which might interfere with the enjoyment of producing something wonderful to eat.'' The book, she wrote, could well be titled ''French Cooking From the American Supermarket.''         As revolutionary as the book was, it might have only gathered cobwebs in bookstores alongside ''Escoffier's Guide Culinaire'' if not for Mrs. Child's way with a whisk on camera. Invited onto a book show on WGBH to talk about ''Mastering,'' she chose to whip up an omelet, beating the eggs in a giant copper bowl. Russell Morash, who became her producer, recalled the sight: ''I thought to myself: Who is this madwoman cooking an omelet on a book-review program?''         Viewers were so taken with the frenzy of cooking and relaxed chatter that Mrs. Child was hired to put together 26 segments, for $50 apiece. Although its host was American and regarded herself as a cook, the program was called ''The French Chef,'' a title that would fit on one line in TV Guide. When stations in Pittsburgh, San Francisco and then New York picked the series up, it was on its way.         ''I think the secret of her appeal was a combination of joy in what she was doing and a deep desire to teach and to teach well,'' said Geof Drummond, who produced Mrs. Child's cooking programs in the 1990's. ''The food was important to her, and it was important to her that you get it.''         With help from her husband she appeared on a set replicating a home kitchen and cooked the dishes of the week, then served them to herself, complete with wine. ''The French Chef'' became the longest-running program in the history of public television; it was followed by ''Julia Child & Company,'' ''Dinner With Julia'' and other series.         The unlikely star whipped through quenelles and coquilles St. Jacques with the greatest of ease, moving on smoothly even after dropping pots or announcing she was about to put a gratin in the refrigerator instead of in the oven where it belonged. Years later, she explained her insouciance by saying that she had demonstrated those same dishes many times at her school in France, whose logo she wore on her signature blue shirt, and that she had the technique down cold.         All her programs were distilled to what she called fundamental lessons. In browning meat, it was as simple as ''hot oil, dry meat and don't crowd the pan.'' She would cook chicken fricassee and coq au vin side by side to show that they were essentially the same dish, one made with white wine, the other with red. She advised viewers to ''plunge right in'' boning a chicken and to ''have the courage of your convictions'' in flipping a potato pancake. Her fearlessness made great television: she roasted ducks, sautéed sweetbreads and stuffed sausages into casings with grunts of effort. She stayed with WGBH even after her series became a national success because it gave her the freedom to cook tripe, kidneys and other offal that she said would not fly on commercial television.         While Mrs. Child has been credited with inspiring a boom in French restaurants, an explosion of fancy food markets and even the arrival of the Food Network, she insisted her original book and program benefited from ''a concatenation of factors'' in the early 1960's. It was an era when Jacqueline Kennedy was raising awareness of all things French, and travel to France, which used to take a week by boat, was shortened to mere hours by plane. Duncan Hines cake mixes and Jell-O salads may have been far more prevalent than chocolate mousse and vinaigrette, but Americans were ready to embrace French food, at least as it was translated by a charismatic compatriot.         Over the years, Mrs. Child devoted herself to her television series while writing companion cookbooks, ending with ''Julia and Jacques Cooking at Home,'' in collaboration with Mr. Pépin, in 1999. For the first books, she would test her recipes upstairs in the open kitchen in Cambridge, Mass., outfitted with a Garland range, while her husband painted in a studio in the basement. When she called, he would come up to photograph her latest creation to give the illustrator something to draw on.         When she wrote recipes, they were long and detailed because, she said, she felt obligated to ensure their success. ''A cookbook is only as good as its worst recipe,'' she said. All 10 of her cookbooks were held up as models of clarity. She was also adamant that cooking was not like free-form jazz: she intended her recipes to be followed to the letter. Her own tastes ran to rather simple food. Overall, she said, she preferred ''la cuisine soignée: long, caring cooking.''         Asked what her favorite meal was, she might mention duck or leg of lamb but would almost always add, ''I love good, fresh food cooked by someone who knows what he's doing.''         She ignored fads and fashions. ''I remember her telling me, 'I hate grilled vegetables,' when those were all the rage,'' Mr. Pépin said. ''She said, 'They're raw and burnt at the same time.'''         As Mrs. Child aged, her role in more and more programs was to sit by as other cooks did the sautéeing. She also appeared regularly on ''Good Morning America'' on ABC in the 1980's.         Mrs. Child was a breast cancer survivor, a cat lover, a fervent advocate of Planned Parenthood and an unabashed sensualist with a sly sense of humor. One year she and her husband sent out Valentine's cards with a photograph of them together in the bathtub in Paris. One of her last projects was to be a memoir of her years in France.         Mrs. Child's obsession with promoting the culinary arts as a profession led to her becoming the first woman inducted into the Culinary Institute of America's hall of fame. She helped establish the American Institute of Wine and Food and, later, Copia: The American Center for Wine, Food and the Arts. In 1986, after the death of her friend James Beard, she led the effort to buy his town house in Greenwich Village and convert it into a nonprofit foundation.         Kitchen Goes to Smithsonian         Mrs. Child was always a star, never a spokeswoman. She prided herself on not granting endorsements because she was devoted to public television, and she was not afraid to mock corporate contributors to her advertising-free programs. She once demonstrated how to break off a part on a Cuisinart food processor to make it less cumbersome to use even as the manufacturer's representatives sat in the audience. And she was known to sue to prevent a restaurant from advertising that it was one of her favorites.         In 1966 she became the first PBS personality to win an Emmy Award. She was awarded a George Foster Peabody Award in 1965, the National Book Award for ''Julia Child and More Company'' in 1980 and the Légion d'Honneur from the French government in 2000. When she moved from her longtime home in Cambridge to a retirement center in her home state, California, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington took her famous kitchen: whisks, stockpots and 800 knives. She also contributed her huge cookbook collection to the Schlesinger Library at Harvard.         She was also active in the International Association of Culinary Professionals. For her 90th birthday, 20 restaurants across the country staged dinners in her honor to raise money for the group to conduct culinary research in France.         Paul Child died in 1994 after a long hospitalization. Julia Child is survived by a sister, Dorothy Cousins, of Mill Valley, Calif., and several nieces and nephews.         To the end, Mrs. Child maintained her image as the ultimate bonne vivante, a California girl with easy French tastes. Whenever she was asked what her guilty pleasures were, she responded, ''I don't have any guilt.''         Despite decades of rumors about her suspiciously relaxed condition on the set, though, she always denied a one-bottle-for-me, one-for-the-pot pattern of cooking. Her husband, in fact, often said that one of his earliest duties was dyeing water with beef extract so that it could pass for red wine on black and white television -- the producers could afford real Burgundy only for the stew, not for the star's glass.         Mr. Drummond, her producer, also debunks another myth. Mrs. Child never dropped a chicken or a turkey on ''The French Chef.'' It was a potato pancake that flew onto the work table when she tried to flip it. She put it back in the pan, pressed it back into shape and said, ''Remember, you are alone in the kitchen, and no one can see you.''         She always refused to speak evil of fast food but admitted she could live without Mexican cuisine, and she never quite saw the point of Italian food. ''I don't think it's a real cuisine because you don't do much,'' she said in an interview last year.         ''I still feel that French cooking is the most important in the world, one of the few that has rules. If you follow the rules, you can do pretty well.''       
         Susan Mary Alsop, who proclaimed that she saw ''no future in being an ordinary person'' and became a celebrated political hostess and later an author, died on Wednesday at her home in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington. She was 86.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, Anne Milliken, her daughter, said.         At 1:46 a.m. on Jan. 21, 1961, John F. Kennedy, after attending his five inaugural balls, showed up, supposedly unannounced, at the doorstep of the Georgetown house then belonging to Mrs. Alsop and her husband, Joseph, the political columnist. Mr. Kennedy stayed 90 minutes and enjoyed some soup and Champagne.         For the next few years, Mrs. Alsop said, she felt she had to have her hair done all the time, ''just in case I'd be asked to the White House.''         The glitter of Mrs. Alsop's social whirl sometimes masked the serious business it facilitated. During the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962, President Kennedy dined at her house with two Soviet experts, the diplomat Charles Bohlen and the philosopher Isaiah Berlin, whose insights helped to inform his judgments in his showdown with Moscow.         Mrs. Alsop was a direct descendant of John Jay, the first chief justice of the United States, and Mr. Alsop called the couple's crowd ''the ever-diminishing group of survivors of the WASP ascendancy.''         Her life sparkled with acquaintances like Churchill and Garbo, and the great Paris designers, including Christian Dior, gave her their latest couture when she was a slim Parisian socialite. As a teenager, she was thrilled to be invited to tea with Edith Wharton, only to find her boring.         At 56, Mrs. Alsop began a writing career, specializing in popular history. One of her four books, ''The Congress Dances: Vienna 1814-1815,'' captured enough spice from that epochal meeting of Europe's leaders that several reviewers said it gave new meaning to affairs of state.         ''It is as if Alsop had attended the festivities herself, and then, returning at dawn, recounted each and every detail so as not to lose a crumb,'' Prince Michael of Greece wrote in a review in The Washington Post.         Susan Mary Jay, the daughter of a diplomat, was born in Rome on June 19, 1918, and grew up in South America, Europe, Washington and New York. She graduated from the Foxcraft School and attended Barnard College.         In 1939, she began working at Vogue as a receptionist, writer and model. She married William S. Patten, who, like her father, was a diplomat. In 1941, they moved to Washington. Her husband's friend Franklin Roosevelt Jr. invited them to supper with his parents at the White House. She said the president shook dry martinis, ''which I adored,'' and served fresh caviar sent by Stalin.         The Pattens then lived in Paris, socializing with people like the Rothschilds, Cecil Beaton and Ho Chi Minh. Mr. Patten died in 1960, and the next year, she married Mr. Alsop, who had been Mr. Patten's roommate at Harvard. She and Mr. Alsop were divorced in 1978, but remained friends and played host at each other's parties. He died in 1989.         Mrs. Alsop is survived by her daughter, who lives in Salt Lake City; her son, Bill Patten, of Worcester, Mass.; seven grandchildren; and a great-grandson.         Lucy Moorhead in her 1979 book, ''Entertaining in Washington,'' called Mrs. Alsop ''glue,'' because she listened intently to loquacious bigwigs, often a key to a good dinner party.         Mrs. Alsop herself suggested that successful Washington get-togethers involve a chimerical brew of power, showmanship and timing.''If you're fortunate enough to get the secretary of state and the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the night of an international crisis ,'' she mused in an interview with The Post in 1987. ''It sounds ghoulish, but it's something you want to have.''       
         Lilian Kallir, a pianist known for her elegant Mozart performances, both as a soloist and in duet recitals with her husband, the pianist Claude Frank, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         Her daughter, the violinist Pamela Frank, said the cause was ovarian cancer.         Ms. Kallir was born in Prague on May 6, 1931, and made her performing debut on radio when she was 4. She left Europe in 1940 and settled in New York, where she continued her piano studies with Isabelle Vengerova and Herman de Grab. She also studied composition, theory and harmony with Hugo Kauder, whose music she later performed in her recitals.         Ms. Kallir's first important performance in New York was an evening of concertos with the National Orchestral Association at Carnegie Hall, in 1949, when she played the Schumann Concerto and gave the premiere of a Concerto by Alan Hovhaness in which she was asked to imitate the sound of a Javanese gamelan, partly by playing on the strings of the piano with a timpani stick. She made her New York Philharmonic debut in 1957.         Ms. Kallir met her husband when they were both students at Tanglewood, in 1947, but they did not marry until 1959. By then Mr. Frank was an assistant to Rudolf Serkin at the Marlboro Festival, in Vermont. They were married at Marlboro; the pianist Eugene Istomin was the best man.         The two pianists began playing recitals together in 1960, in a format that included solo performances by each, as well as at least one collaborative work.         But although their names are inextricably linked as a duet team for many listeners, Mr. Frank said they had actually devoted most their time to performing on their own, mainly because they disliked much of duet repertory. But they did give countless performances of the Mozart works for two pianos.         On her own, Ms. Kallir favored Mozart and Chopin, with Bartok and Kodaly as the forward edge of her repertory. She performed Mozart and Beethoven Concertos with most of the major American and European orchestras, and was a favorite at the Mostly Mozart Festival from its early years.         She was also a devoted chamber music player. She played recitals with the violinist Pinchas Zukerman, the cellist Yo-Yo Ma and the clarinetist Richard Stoltzman. And she performed with the Juilliard, Emerson, Guarneri, Cleveland and Tokyo String Quartets. Ms. Kallir also gave performances with her daughter, who survives her, as does her husband.       
         Trina Schart Hyman, who illustrated an entire shelf of children's books and inspired many others who worked in the genre, died on Friday in Lebanon, N.H. She was 65 and lived in Lyme, N.H.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, said Jean Aull, her partner.         She won the Caldecott Medal, the highest award for authors and artists in her field, for Margaret Hodges's ''St. George and the Dragon: A Golden Legend Adapted From Edmund Spenser's 'Faerie Queen''' (Little, Brown: 1984). She won Caldecott honors three times, for ''Little Red Riding Hood''; ''A Child's Calendar,'' with text by John Updike; and ''Hershel and the Hanukkah Goblins'' by Eric A. Kimmel (Holiday House, 1989).         She joined the staff of Cricket magazine for children as an artist and illustrator in 1972 and became its art director. By the time she left, in 1979, she had established herself as a model for many others looking for a career in children's book publishing.         In all, Ms. Hyman illustrated more than 150 books. Her watercolors, oils and drawings enlivened everything from collected stories to novels to poetry, as well as oft-retold classics like ''Sleeping Beauty,'' ''Rapunzel'' and the Arthurian legends.         She worked with readers as young as toddlers in mind, and she was widely known for opening their eyes to folklore and fairy tales. Her pictures gave form to the imagery conjured up by master storytellers like the Brothers Grimm, Hans Christian Andersen, Mark Twain, Dickens, Chaucer, Dylan Thomas and, not least, Margot Fonteyn's retelling of ''Swan Lake.''         She also wrote her own books, which she illustrated, including ''How Six Found Christmas'' (Holiday House, 1991); ''A Little Alphabet'' (William Morrow, 1993); her retelling of the Grimms' ''Little Red Riding Hood'' (Holiday House, 1983); and ''Self-Portrait: Trina Schart Hyman'' (Addison-Wesley, 1981). Another more recent favorite was ''A Child's Calendar'' (Holiday House, 1999), in which she illustrated poems by Mr. Updike, one for each month.         John Briggs, publisher of Holiday House, estimated her output at millions of copies, with many of her books translated for publication in other countries.         She was born Trina Schart in Philadelphia and grew up in Doylestown, Pa. She studied at the Philadelphia Museum College of Art and the Boston Museum School of Art in the late 1950's and trained for one more year at the Konstfackskolan, the Swedish State Art School, in Stockholm in 1960 and 1961.         Her first work was published in Sweden in 1961, to accompany stories about ''Toffe and the Little Car.'' By the end of the 1960's, she had done more than two dozen book from American publishers like Houghton, Scholastic, Bobbs-Merrill and LittleBrown.         Her marriage to Harris Hyman, of Portland, Ore., ended in divorce.Besides Ms. Aull, Ms. Hyman is survived by her daughter, Katrin Tchana of Fairlee, Vt., for whom she illustrated a retelling of ''The Serpent Slayer and Other Stories of Strong Women'' (Little, Brown; 1998); and two grandsons.       
         Dame Alicia Markova, one of the greatest British ballerinas of the 20th century, co-founder of the company now known as the English National Ballet and a former director of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet, died yesterday in Bath, England, the English National Ballet announced. She was 94.         Famous for her delicacy, Dame Alicia was indelibly associated with ''Giselle,'' the supreme example of 19th-century balletic Romanticism. It was as Giselle that she made her American debut with the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, giving a performance that was thought to set a standard for any other dancer attempting the part. She later performed Giselle as a star of Ballet Theater (as American Ballet Theater was originally called) and as a guest artist with companies around the world. She was so closely identified with the ballet that in 1960 she titled her autobiography ''Giselle and I.''         Audiences never tired of watching Dame Alicia in ''Giselle''; she, in turn, never seemed to tire of dancing it. Reviewing a 1958 performance by Ballet Theater in which Miss Markova appeared as guest artist, John Martin, then the dance critic of The New York Times, remarked: ''Markova has danced the role so many times that she could undoubtedly do it in her sleep; what is so notable is that she never does. She is as fresh, as sensitive, as creatively alert as if she had never done it before; but what a wealth of background she has accumulated for it!''         Lillian Alicia Marks was born in London on Dec. 1, 1910. A knock-kneed child, she was sent by her doctor to a London school called Miss Thorne's Dancing Academy. She astounded her teacher with her ability to do anything asked of her, and she was soon cast in dancing roles in Christmas pantomimes.         Mrs. Marks took her daughter to a London school run by the ballerina Serafina Astafieva. She presented Astafieva with a card bearing the child's name as she had been billed in the pantomimes: ''Little Alicia: The Miniature Pavlova.'' Aghast at this presumption, Astafieva slammed the door in their faces. Later, however, she saw Alicia dance and accepted her as a pupil.         In 1924 the teenage Alicia became the youngest member of Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, the greatest ballet company of its day. She danced her first leading role in 1926, when she portrayed the nightingale in ''Le Rossignol,'' choreographed by George Balanchine to music by Stravinsky. Non-Russian dancers in the Ballets Russes were expected to change their names, and it was Diaghilev who gave the British dancer her professional name. He also gave Miss Markova a governess, who made sure that her charge went to bed early when she was not performing and saw to it that she did not overindulge in chocolates and that she attended no social occasions but chaperoned teas.         After Diaghilev died in 1929, Miss Markova returned to London and became active with both of the pioneering British ballet groups of the day, the Ballet Rambert and the Vic-Wells Ballet, the last of which developed into the Royal Ballet. Because she was already an esteemed dancer, her presence lent prestige to these troupes and, because she was British, she proved that ballet was not something in which only Russians could excel.         In 1934 she formed the Markova-Dolin Ballet with another British dancer, Anton Dolin, the partner with whom she was associated for much of her career. She joined the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938, remaining with it until 1941, when she joined Ballet Theater, where Mr. Dolin was again her partner. In 1945 they formed a Markova-Dolin Ballet in America.         Returning to Britain after the war, they made their troupe the basis of the London Festival Ballet (today's English National Ballet). Mr. Dolin was its first director; Miss Markova was its ballerina until 1952, after which she devoted herself to guest performances. She retired as a dancer in 1963, the year Queen Elizabeth II named her Dame of the British Empire.         Known for her beautiful purity of line and her classic simplicity of movement, Dame Alicia was admired in ''Swan Lake'' and ''Les Sylphides'' as well as in ''Giselle.'' Yet this ethereal ballerina could surprise audiences with her range. She certainly did so with Ballet Theater in 1942 when she danced two contrasting roles. One was Juliet in Antony Tudor's ''Romeo and Juliet.'' In 1946 the dance historian Grace Robert praised that interpretation in ''The Borzoi Book of Ballets,'' writing that ''Markova's deerlike shyness in the first scene, her tragic, controlled despair, the exquisite movement of her hand as she wakes up in the tomb scene, all are unforgettable in their subtlety.''         But this poignant Juliet was tempestuous as the gypsy Zemphira in Léonide Massine's ''Aleko.'' ''The great surprise of 'Aleko' was the superb Zemphira of Alicia Markova,'' Robert wrote. ''Her exquisite 'Swan Lake' and matchless 'Giselle' contained no hint of the fire and quite different sort of dramatic intensity of her gypsy. With sunburnt makeup, wild hair and a vivid red costume, her very appearance was a shock, though a delightful one.''         Dame Alicia, who had occasionally made guest appearances in the ballet sequences of works in the repertory of the Metropolitan Opera, astonished the dance world in 1963 when she accepted an invitation to direct the Metropolitan Opera Ballet. The Met's dance troupe had never been considered important and the opera management had seldom shown much interest in ballet. Nevertheless, in her six years as director, Dame Alicia raised the dancers' technical level and made it possible for the ballet company to present programs of its own.         In 1970 Dame Alicia became a distinguished lecturer on ballet at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, the home school of the Cincinnati Ballet. She remained there until 1974, after which she gave occasional master classes for many organizations, including the Royal Ballet School. She also staged revivals of ballets in which she had starred, and presided over dance festivals and conferences.         A gala was held in honor of Dame Alicia's 80th birthday on Dec. 2, 1990, at the Sadler's Wells Theater in London. On that occasion, Dame Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, spoke in tribute to her.         A tiny black-haired woman, Dame Alicia was just over 5 feet 2 inches tall, and during her dancing years she rarely weighed more than 98 pounds, even though she usually devoured a thick steak after performances.         Her life was as carefully organized as her dancing. She moved through each day with quiet determination and her life was almost entirely devoted to ballet. She never married. Among her few diversions were expensive clothes, classical music and gin rummy, at which she usually won.       
         Susan Sontag, the novelist, essayist and critic whose impassioned advocacy of the avant-garde and equally impassioned political pronouncements made her one of the most lionized presences -- and one of the most polarizing -- in 20th-century letters, died yesterday morning in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 71.         The cause was complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, her son, David Rieff, said. Ms. Sontag, who died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, had been ill with cancer intermittently for the last 30 years, a struggle that informed one of her most famous books, the critical study ''Illness as Metaphor'' (1978).         A highly visible public figure since the mid-1960's, Ms. Sontag wrote four novels, dozens of essays and a volume of short stories and was also an occasional filmmaker, playwright and theater director. For four decades her work was part of the contemporary canon, discussed everywhere from graduate seminars to the pages of popular magazines to the Hollywood movie ''Bull Durham.''         Ms. Sontag's work made a radical break with traditional postwar criticism in America, gleefully blurring the boundaries between high and popular culture. She advocated an aesthetic approach to the study of culture, championing style over content. She was concerned, in short, with sensation, in both meanings of the term.         ''The theme that runs through Susan's writing is this lifelong struggle to arrive at the proper balance between the moral and the aesthetic,'' Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic and an old friend of Ms. Sontag's, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''There was something unusually vivid about her writing. That's why even if one disagrees with it -- as I did frequently -- it was unusually stimulating. She showed you things you hadn't seen before; she had a way of reopening questions.''         Through four decades, public response to Ms. Sontag remained irreconcilably divided. She was described, variously, as explosive, anticlimactic, original, derivative, naïve, sophisticated, approachable, aloof, condescending, populist, puritanical, sybaritic, sincere, posturing, ascetic, voluptuary, right-wing, left-wing, profound, superficial, ardent, bloodless, dogmatic, ambivalent, lucid, inscrutable, visceral, reasoned, chilly, effusive, relevant, passé, tenacious, ecstatic, melancholic, humorous, humorless, deadpan, rhapsodic, cantankerous and clever. No one ever called her dull.         Ms. Sontag's best-known books, all published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, include the novels ''Death Kit'' (1967), ''The Volcano Lover'' (1992) and ''In America'' (2000); the essay collections ''Against Interpretation'' (1966), ''Styles of Radical Will'' (1969) and ''Under the Sign of Saturn'' (1980); the critical studies ''On Photography'' (1977) and ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' (1989); and the short-story collection ''I, Etcetera'' (1978). One of her most famous works, however, was not a book, but an essay, ''Notes on Camp,'' published in 1964 and still widely read.         Her most recent book, published last year, was ''Regarding the Pain of Others,'' a long essay on the imagery of war and disaster. One of her last published essays, ''Regarding the Torture of Others,'' written in response to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by Americans at Abu Ghraib, appeared in the May 23, 2004, issue of The New York Times Magazine.         An Intellectual With Glamour         Unlike most serious intellectuals, Ms. Sontag was also a celebrity, partly because of her telegenic appearance, partly because of her outspoken statements. She was undoubtedly the only writer of her generation to win major literary prizes (among them a National Book Critics Circle Award, a National Book Award and a MacArthur Foundation genius grant) and to appear in films by Woody Allen and Andy Warhol; to be the subject of rapturous profiles in Rolling Stone and People magazines; and to be photographed by Annie Leibovitz for an Absolut Vodka ad. Through the decades her image -- strong features, wide mouth, intense gaze and dark mane crowned in her middle years by a sweeping streak of white -- became an instantly recognizable artifact of 20th-century popular culture.         Ms. Sontag was a master synthesist who tackled broad, difficult and elusive subjects: the nature of art, the nature of consciousness and, above all, the nature of the modern condition. Where many American critics before her had mined the past, Ms. Sontag became an evangelist of the new, training her eye on the culture unfolding around her.         For Ms. Sontag, culture encompassed a vast landscape. She wrote serious studies of popular art forms, like cinema and science fiction, that earlier critics disdained. She produced impassioned essays on the European writers and filmmakers she admired, like Jean-Paul Sartre, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Jean-Luc Godard. She wrote experimental novels on dreams and the nature of consciousness. She published painstaking critical dissections of photography and dance; illness, politics and pornography; and, most famously, camp. Her work, with its emphasis on the outré, the jagged and the here and now, helped make the study of popular culture a respectable academic pursuit.         What united Ms. Sontag's output was a propulsive desire to define the forces that shape the modernist sensibility. And in so doing, she sought to explain what it meant to be human in the waning years of the 20th century.         To many critics, her work was bold and thrilling. Interviewed in The Times Magazine in 1992, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes compared Ms. Sontag to the Renaissance humanist Erasmus. ''Erasmus traveled with 32 volumes, which contained all the knowledge worth knowing,'' he said. ''Susan Sontag carries it in her brain! I know of no other intellectual who is so clear-minded, with a capacity to link, to connect, to relate.''         A Bevy of Detractors         Others were less enthralled. Some branded Ms. Sontag an unoriginal thinker, a popularizer with a gift for aphorism who could boil down difficult writers for mass consumption. (Irving Howe called her ''a publicist able to make brilliant quilts from grandmother's patches.'') Some regarded her tendency to revisit her earlier, often controversial positions as ambivalent. Some saw her scholarly approach to popular art forms as pretentious. (Ms. Sontag once remarked that she could appreciate Patti Smith because she had read Nietzsche.)         In person Ms. Sontag could be astringent, particularly if she felt she had been misunderstood. She grew irritated when reporters asked how many books she had in her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan (15,000; no television set). But she could also be warm and girlish, speaking confidingly in her rich, low voice, her feet propped casually on the nearest coffee table. She laughed readily, and when she discussed something that engaged her passionately (and there were many things), her dark eyes often filled with tears.         Ms. Sontag had a knack -- or perhaps a penchant -- for getting into trouble. She could be provocative to the point of being inflammatory, as when she championed the Nazi-era filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl in a 1965 essay; she would revise her position some years later. She celebrated the communist societies of Cuba and North Vietnam; just as provocatively, she later denounced communism as a form of fascism. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, she wrote in The New Yorker, ''Whatever may be said of the perpetrators of Tuesday's slaughter, they were not cowards.'' And in 2000, the publication of Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' raised accusations of plagiarism, charges she vehemently denied.         Ms. Sontag was born Susan Rosenblatt in Manhattan on Jan. 16, 1933, the daughter of Jack and Mildred Rosenblatt. Her father was a fur trader in China, and her mother joined him there for long periods, leaving Susan and her younger sister in the care of relatives. When Susan was 5, her father died in China of tuberculosis. Seeking relief for Susan's asthma, her mother moved the family to Tucson, spending the next several years there. In Arizona, Susan's mother met Capt. Nathan Sontag, a World War II veteran sent there to recuperate. The couple were married -- Susan took her stepfather's name -- and the family moved to Los Angeles.         For Susan, who graduated from high school before her 16th birthday, the philistinism of American culture was a torment she vowed early to escape. ''My greatest dream,'' she later wrote, ''was to grow up and come to New York and write for Partisan Review and be read by 5,000 people.''         She would get her wish -- Ms. Sontag burst onto the scene with ''Notes on Camp,'' which was published in Partisan Review -- but not before she earned a bachelor's and two master's degrees from prestigious American universities; studied at Oxford on a fellowship; and married, became a mother and divorced eight years later, all by the time she turned 26.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Sontag spent a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, before transferring to the University of Chicago, from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1951. At Chicago she wandered into a class taught by the sociologist Philip Rieff, then a 28-year-old instructor, who would write the celebrated study ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (Viking, 1959). He was, she would say, the first person with whom she could really talk; they were married 10 days later. Ms. Sontag was 17 and looked even younger, clad habitually in blue jeans, her black hair spilling down her back. Word swept around campus that Dr. Rieff had married a 14-year-old American Indian.         An Academic Beginning         Moving with her husband to Boston, Ms. Sontag earned her master's degrees from Harvard, the first in English, in 1954, the second in philosophy the next year. She began work on a Ph.D., but did not complete her dissertation. In 1952 she and Dr. Rieff became the parents of a son, David Rieff, who survives her. Mr. Rieff lives in Manhattan and was for many years his mother's editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. (A journalist, he wrote ''Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West,'' published by Simon & Schuster in 1995.) Also surviving is her younger sister, Judith Cohen of Maui.         After further study at Oxford and in Paris, Ms. Sontag was divorced from Dr. Rieff in 1958. In early 1959 she arrived in New York with, as she later described it, ''$70, two suitcases and a 7- year- old.'' She worked as an editor at Commentary and juggled teaching jobs at City College, Sarah Lawrence and Columbia. She published her first essays, critical celebrations of modernists she admired, as well as her first novel, ''The Benefactor'' (1963), an exploration of consciousness and dreams.         With ''Notes on Camp'' Ms. Sontag fired a shot across the bow of the New York critical establishment, which included eminences like Lionel and Diana Trilling, Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe. Interlaced with epigrams from Oscar Wilde, that essay illuminated a particular modern sensibility -- one that had been largely the province of gay culture -- which centered deliciously on artifice, exaggeration and the veneration of style.         ''The experiences of Camp are based on the great discovery that the sensibility of high culture has no monopoly on refinement,'' Ms. Sontag wrote. ''The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion.''         If that essay has today lost its capacity to shock, it is a reflection of how thoroughly Ms. Sontag did her job, serving as a guide to an underground aesthetic that was not then widely known.         ''She found in camp an aesthetic that was very different from what the straight world had acknowledged up to that point, and she managed to make camp 'straight' in a way,'' Arthur C. Danto, the Johnsonian professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia and the art critic for The Nation, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''I think she prepared the ground for the pop revolution, which was in many ways essentially a gay revolution, through Warhol and others. She didn't make that art, but she brought it to consciousness. She gave people a vocabulary for talking about it and thinking about it.''         The article made Ms. Sontag an international celebrity, showered with lavish, if unintentionally ridiculous, titles (''a literary pinup,'' ''the dark lady of American letters,'' ''the Natalie Wood of the U.S. avant-garde'').         Championing Style Over Content         In 1966 Ms. Sontag published her first essay collection, ''Against Interpretation.'' That book's title essay, in which she argued that art should be experienced viscerally rather than cerebrally, helped cement her reputation as a champion of style over content.         It was a position she could take to extremes. In the essay ''On Style,'' published in the same volume, Ms. Sontag offended many readers by upholding the films of Leni Riefenstahl as masterworks of aesthetic form, with little regard for their content. Ms. Sontag would eventually reconsider her position in the 1974 essay ''Fascinating Fascism.''         Though she thought of herself as a novelist, it was through her essays that Ms. Sontag became known. As a result she was fated to write little else for the next quarter-century. She found the form an agony: a long essay took from nine months to a year to complete, often requiring 20 or more drafts.         ''I've had thousands of pages for a 30-page essay,'' she said in a 1992 interview. '''On Photography,' which is six essays, took five years. And I mean working every single day.''         That book, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism in 1978, explored the role of the photographic image, and the act of picture-taking in contemporary culture. The crush of photographs, Ms. Sontag argued, has shaped our perceptions of the world, numbing us to depictions of suffering. She would soften that position when she revisited the issue in ''Regarding the Pain of Others.''         The Washington Post Book World called ''On Photography'' ''a brilliant analysis,'' adding that it '' merely describes a phenomenon we take as much for granted as water from the tap, and how that phenomenon has changed us -- a remarkable enough achievement, when you think about it.''         In the mid-1970's Ms. Sontag learned she had breast cancer. Doctors gave her a 10 percent chance of surviving for two years. She scoured the literature for a treatment that might save her, underwent a mastectomy and persuaded her doctors to give her a two-and-a-half-year course of radiation.         Out of her experience came ''Illness as Metaphor,'' which examined the cultural mythologizing of disease (tuberculosis as the illness of 19th-century romantics, cancer a modern-day scourge). Although it did not discuss her illness explicitly, it condemned the often militaristic language around illness (''battling'' disease, the ''war'' on cancer) that Ms. Sontag felt simultaneously marginalized the sick and held them responsible for their condition..         In ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' Ms. Sontag discussed the social implications of the disease, which she viewed as a ''cultural plague'' that had replaced cancer as the modern bearer of stigma. She would return to the subject of AIDS in her acclaimed short story ''The Way We Live Now,'' originally published in The New Yorker and included in ''The Best American Short Stories of the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1999).         Although Ms. Sontag was strongly identified with the American left during the Vietnam era, in later years her politics were harder to classify. In the essay ''Trip to Hanoi,'' which appears in ''Styles of Radical Will,'' she wrote glowingly of a visit to North Vietnam. But in 1982 she delivered a stinging blow to progressives in a speech at Town Hall in Manhattan. There, at a rally in support of the Solidarity movement in Poland, she denounced European communism as ''fascism with a human face.''         In 1992, weary of essays, Ms. Sontag published ''The Volcano Lover,'' her first novel in 25 years. Though very much a novel of ideas -- it explored, among other things, notions of aesthetics and the psychology of obsessive collecting -- the book was also a big, old-fashioned historical romance. It told the story of Sir William Hamilton, the 18th-century British envoy to the court of Naples; his wife, Emma (''that Hamilton woman''); and her lover, Lord Nelson, the naval hero. The book spent two months on The New York Times best-seller list.         Reviewing the novel in The Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote: ''One thing that makes 'The Volcano Lover' such a delight to read is the way it throws off ideas and intellectual sparks, like a Roman candle or Catherine wheel blazing in the night. Miniature versions of 'Don Giovanni' and 'Tosca' lie embedded, like jewels, in the main narrative; and we are given as well some charmingly acute cameos of such historical figures as Goethe and the King and Queen of Naples.''         Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' was loosely based on the life of the 19th-century Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who immigrated to California to start a utopian community. Though ''In America'' received a National Book Award, critical reception was mixed. Then accusations of plagiarism surfaced. As The Times reported in May 2000, a reader identified at least a dozen passages as being similar to those in four other books about the real Modjeska, including Modjeska's memoirs. Except for a brief preface expressing a general debt to ''books and articles by and on Modjeska,'' Ms. Sontag did not specifically acknowledge her sources.         Interviewed for The Times article, Ms. Sontag defended her method. ''All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain,'' she said. ''I've used these sources and I've completely transformed them. I have these books. I've looked at these books. There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.''         Ms. Sontag's other work includes the play ''Alice in Bed'' (1993); ''A Susan Sontag Reader'' (1982), with an introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick; and four films, including ''Duet for Cannibals'' (1969) and ''Brother Carl'' (1971). She also edited works by Barthes, Antonin Artaud, Danilo Kis and other writers.         Ms. Sontag was the subject of an unauthorized biography by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock, ''Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon'' (Norton, 2000), and of several critical studies, including ''Sontag & Kael: Opposites Attract Me,'' by Craig Seligman (Counterpoint/Perseus, 2004). She was the president of the PEN American Center from 1987 to 1989.         In a 1992 interview with The Times Magazine, Ms. Sontag described the creative force that animated ''The Volcano Lover,'' putting her finger on the sensibility that would inform all her work: ''I don't want to express alienation. It isn't what I feel. I'm interested in various kinds of passionate engagement. All my work says, be serious, be passionate, wake up.''         A Life of the Mind         For four decades, Susan Sontag's books were published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. These are some of the more notable.

         Agnes Martin, an American painter whose luminous fields of pale color traversed by hand-drawn pencil lines preserved the Romantic spirit of Abstract Expressionism and prefigured the austerities of Minimalism, died yesterday in a retirement community in Taos, N.M.         She was 92 and had lived in New Mexico for many years. Her death was announced by the chairman of the PaceWildenstein gallery, Arne Glimcher, her friend and longtime dealer.         In New York in the 1950's and 60's, Ms. Martin was an integral part of a small, brilliant, diverse community of artists -- Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly and Robert Rauschenberg among them -- who lived in derelict 19th-century shipping lofts in Lower Manhattan and created a new postwar American art.         Yet Ms. Martin was fundamentally a loner. In 1967, when her New York career was taking off, she abruptly left the city, wandered the country for months in a pickup and camper, and stopped making art for seven years. She finally settled in New Mexico, building an adobe house with her own hands on a remote mesa where in winter she was snowed in for weeks at a time. After she resumed painting in 1974 her reputation grew and took on the aura of a legend, and her work was widely collected. She became an inspiration to younger artists, from Eva Hesse to Ellen Gallagher, attracted to her undemonstrative but intensely personal art.         Agnes Bernice Martin was born in Macklin, Saskatchewan, Canada, on March 22, 1912, a descendant of Scottish Presbyterian pioneers. Her father, a wheat farmer, died when she was 2; her mother supported the family by selling real estate. Ms. Martin spent much of her childhood with her maternal grandfather, a gentle, religious man who introduced her to inspirational literature, including John Bunyan's ''Pilgrim's Progress,'' which remained important to her throughout her life.         She had a strong early interest in art, but opted for the financial security of teaching, and in the 1940's moved to New York to study art education at Teachers College, Columbia University. While there she became aware of Abstract Expressionism, the modern style that she felt most in tune with, partly because its artists were of her generation; she and Jackson Pollock were born in the same year. It is possible to view her as the last of the generation of Abstract Expressionists.         After hearing lectures by the Zen Buddhist scholar D.T. Suzuki at Columbia, she became interested in Asian thought, not as a religious discipline, but as a code of ethics, a practical how-to for getting through life.         ''One thing I like about Zen,'' she wrote. ''It doesn't believe in achievement. I don't think the way to succeed is by doing something aggressive. Aggression is weak-minded.''         In Taos in 1954 she did her first semiabstract work. The art dealer Betty Parsons saw it and invited Ms. Martin to join her New York stable, which included Ad Reinhardt and younger artists like Mr. Kelly. The only stipulation was that Ms. Martin return to Manhattan. She did so in 1957, joining Mr. Kelly, Robert Indiana, Lenore Tawney and other artists on Coenties Slip near Wall Street. Barnett Newman, with whose art she felt a particular affinity, had a studio nearby. During the decade she spent there, she developed a fully abstract style based on tight grids and repetitive linear marks.         Then she left New York. Urban renewal was about to drastically alter her downtown neighborhood. The competitive New York art world unnerved her. A relationship may have gone wrong. Ms. Martin, who had a history of psychological crises, said elliptically, ''I came to a place of recognition of confusion that had to be solved.''         Before leaving she gave away all her paint and canvas rolls, hoping young artists would use them. Once she starting painting again in 1974, however, she worked solidly until the end of her life, in a format that seldom varied: six-foot-square canvases on which she drew horizontal graphite lines and painted bands of color with subtly vigorous strokes. She changed her palette from series to series, using pale colors one year, and black, white or gray the next.         She first showed at PaceWildenstein, formerly Pace Gallery, in 1975, and became a mainstay there. Her most recent show was in the spring, and in a departure, the paintings referred back to the geometric forms of her Coenties Slip work.         She had two career retrospectives, one at the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania in 1973, the other at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1992. In 1993 the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam organized a traveling survey of her post-1974 work. A selection of early paintings is on view at Dia:Beacon through April. And an installation of paintings is on permanent view in a specially designed gallery in the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos. Her work is in most major United States museum collections.         Ms. Martin was awarded a National Medal of Arts by President Clinton in 1998 and recently accepted a lifetime achievement award from the Women's Caucus for Art.         Several years ago she moved to the retirement community. There her daily routine seldom varied. She rose early and drove to her nearby studio, where she worked alone from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. One of the few concessions she made to age was to reduce the size of her paintings so that she could continue to move them herself. She never had an assistant.         Although shy in public, Ms. Martin lectured periodically, offering her thoughts on art and life in series of epigrammatic statements that combined Victorian poetry, Buddhist philosophy, transcendentalism, American-style positive thinking and the inspirational literature of her youth. The lectures were collected into a book in 1992, ''Writings,'' which established her as a moral thinker as well as an artist. Some critics consider her words an essential complement to her ineffable paintings.         Like her paintings, her writing was lucid and severe, measured but driven. She insisted that art was not an instrument for social change and, in a post-1960's America highly conscious of racial and sexual identity, her social views tended to be conservative and provincial. Art's value, in her thinking, was in its ability to counteract negative thoughts and emotions, promote psychic calm over chaos, and establish stability in a world of unpredictable and potentially shattering change.         Before her death, Ms. Martin specified that she wanted no memorial service or eulogies. She leaves no survivors.         ''The value of art is in the observer,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times. ''When you find out what you like, you're really finding out about yourself. Beethoven's music is joyous. If you like his music, you know that you like to be joyful. People who look at my painting say that it makes them happy, like the feeling when you wake up in the morning. And happiness is the goal, isn't it?''
