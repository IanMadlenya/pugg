        Jeanne Behrend, a pianist and composer who specialized in American music, died March 20 after a long illness at the Logan East retirement community care center in Philadelphia. She was 76 years old.         Jeanne Behrend, a pianist and composer who specialized in American music, died March 20 after a long illness at the Logan East retirement community care center in Philadelphia. She was 76 years old.         Miss Behrend was born in Philadelphia and made her first public apperarance there at the age of 11. In 1934 she graduated from the city's Curtis Institute, where she studied piano with Josef Hofmann and composition with Rosario Scalero.         Her New York debut followed in 1937 at Carnegie Hall, with a program that included a piano sonata she had composed. Howard Taubman, writing in The New York Times, found fault with the sonata but praised her playing.         Throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, Miss Behrend pursued a considerable pianistic career, concentrating on the music of North and South America. Heitor Villa-Lobos, the Brazilian composer, called her ''a heroine of the Americas,'' and she played often in Latin American countries. In 1959 she founded and directed the Philadelphia Festival of Western Hemisphere Music, and in 1965 she was awarded the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross. Gave Up Composing         As a composer, Miss Behrend produced a variety of mostly small-scale pieces, only some of which were published. After giving up composition in the late 1940's, she explained that she felt opportunities for women in composing were too limiting.         Miss Behrend taught courses in American music and piano at a variety of institutions in Philadelphia as well as at the Juilliard School in New York. A Gottschalk expert, she edited a selection of his piano scores as well as his autobiography, ''Notes of a Pianist.'' She also edited a Stephen Foster song collection and a volume of American fuguing tunes.         Her first husband, Alexander Kelberine, a pianist, died in 1940, and her second husband, George S. McManus, a collector and dealer in books specializing in Americana, died in 1967. Miss Behrend is survived by her sister, Ruth Hagedorn, of Gadsden, Ala.       
        When asked, after a trip to Egypt, how she liked the pyramids, the sculptor Louise Nevelson replied, ''Too small.'' The response, said the art dealer Arnold Glimcher, typified her sense of ''grandeur,'' her ''great expectations'' for herself and everyone around her.         When asked, after a trip to Egypt, how she liked the pyramids, the sculptor Louise Nevelson replied, ''Too small.'' The response, said the art dealer Arnold Glimcher, typified her sense of ''grandeur,'' her ''great expectations'' for herself and everyone around her.         Mr. Glimcher's anecdote was one of many wonderful stories told about the irreverent and irrepressible sculptor at a memorial service held yesterday in the Medieval Court of the Metropolitan Museum. Mrs. Nevelson died at her home in SoHo on April 17 at the age of 88.         Among the more than 250 people who attended were stellar figures from the worlds of art, fashion and the movies. They included the artists Jasper Johns, Marisol, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal and Saul Steinberg; the art dealer Leo Castelli; the actress Sigourney Weaver; the musician John Cage; the couturier Arnold Scaasi; the photographer Arnold Newman, and the museum directors Philippe de Montebello, Richard Oldenburg and Robert Buck, along with William Luers, the Metropolitan's president. Also in attendance were Mrs. Nevelson's son, Mike Nevelson; her sister-in-law, Lillian Berliawsky, and her longtime assistant, Diana McKown. Between tributes spoken by friends, a quintet played music by Beethoven, Mozart and Ludwig Thuille, a 19th-century German composer. Rearranging 'Mountain Woman'         At the gathering, William Lieberman, director of the department of 20th-century art at the Met, described Mrs. Nevelson as ''a great artist, a wonderful woman, an elegant lady and a good and generous friend.''         Mr. Glimcher, Mrs. Nevelson's dealer for many years, drew laughter from the guests by telling of her reluctance to exhibit ''Mountain Woman'' -an early work that she had always disliked - in her 1967 retrospective at the Whitney Museum. As the curator kept insisting on it, ''she was more and more unhappy,'' he said.         Shortly before the show opened, Mrs. Nevelson requested that Mr. Glimcher help her ''rearrange'' it. ''She asked us to carry 'Mountain Woman' across the room, and at midpoint she said, ''Drop it,'' Mr. Glimcher recalled. ''We did, and the work was 'rearranged' to her satisfaction, in a thousand pieces.'' A Telegram at Yaddo         Hilton Kramer, editor of The New Criterion, a magazine of the arts, told of writing one of the earliest reviews of Mrs. Nevelson's work in the mid-1950's. It was the first in her long series of sculptural environments known as ''walls.'' He said that later, at Yaddo, the writers' retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., he was summoned to the telephone by Western Union with a telegram from Mrs. Nevelson. ''The telegram read, 'I love you,' '' Mr. Kramer recalled.         Despite her later success, he went on to say, Mrs. Nevelson ''remained extraordinarily independent of her reputation and other people's reputations.'' And he cited her belief that ''you can be anything you want to be'' as ''the key to her artistic ambitions, her esthetic audacity and the personal freedom she achieved as woman as well as artist.''         Barbaralee Diamonstein, a member of the New York City Landmarks Commission, a writer on art and architecture and a longtime friend of Mrs. Nevelson, described the sculptor -known for her theatrical garb and personality almost as much as for her art - as ''all collage:her work, her conversation, her ensembles.''         ''A complex cross between a princess and a peasant, an egalitarian with some surprisingly elitist concerns,'' she said, ''Louise was a living assemblage who accurately mirrored her startling and stunning constructions.'' 'I Always Knew I Was Great'         Speaking also of Mrs. Nevelson's belief in herself as a vital factor in her work, Miss Diamonstein recalled once asking her how she had survived during her many years of obscurity before success. ''I always knew I was great,'' Mrs. Nevelson replied. The short program was ended by the playwright Edward Albee, who said Mrs. Nevelson had understood ''perhaps better than any artist I've known, that she was her art.'' And he told of interviewing the sculptor with a tape recorder for an article he was writing. ''She said she didn't mind,'' he said. ''I tested it out and it worked well. Then, when I actually put it on the table, she said 'What's that?' She passed her hand over it a few times. I asked the important questions. When I got home, my tape recorder was blank. It was simply that Louise was a wizard and those of us who knew her, knew her work, we knew she was a wizard, did we not?''       
        Irmgard Seefried, a German-born Austrian soprano who gained great success in the postwar years in operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, died of cancer yesterday in Vienna. She was 69 years old.         Irmgard Seefried, a German-born Austrian soprano who gained great success in the postwar years in operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, died of cancer yesterday in Vienna. She was 69 years old.         Though Miss Seefried spent most of her career with the Vienna State Opera, she sang frequently at Covent Garden in London, at La Scala in Milan and at music festivals in Salzburg, Edinburgh, Lucerne and elsewhere. She was also a respected recital and concert singer. She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in November 1953, as Susanna in Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro'' - one of her signature roles.         Miss Seefried was born on Oct. 9, 1919, in Kongetried, a small town in Bavaria. Her father started to give her music lessons when she was a small child, and at the age of 11 she sang the role of Gretel in a performance of Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel.'' She studied at the Augsburg Conservatory, and in 1939 joined the Aachen Opera at the invitation of Herbert von Karajan.         She made her Vienna State Opera debut in 1943, as Eva in Wagner's ''Meistersinger,'' and remained with the company until her retirement in 1980.         Miss Seefried made several concert tours of Europe, the United States and the Far East in the 1950's. In 1953, she and her husband, the violinist Wolfgang Schneiderhan, did a world concert tour together. 'Authority of Style'         From the start of her career, Miss Seefried was praised for the clarity of her voice and her appealing stage presence. Reviewing her Metropolitan Opera debut, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times, ''The shining light of this performance was Miss Seefried, whose beautiful voice and brilliancy and authority of style won her instant recognition.''         During several seasons in the 1950's, she appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony orchestra under the direction of Bruno Walter. Reviewing her 1956 performance of ''Et Incarnatus Est'' from the Mozart Mass in C minor, Howard Taubman said in The Times: ''The top of her soprano may not have the brilliance of some other singers, but she is an artist. She sang with warmth and tenderness and with a richness of understanding.''         Though her repertory came to include works by Hindemith, Poulenc, Berg and other modern composers, she was best known for her work in operas by Mozart, including Fiordiligi in ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' and Zerlina in ''Don Giovanni,'' and by Strauss, including Octavian in ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and the Composer in ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' She also sang Marzelline in Beethoven's ''Fidelio.''         Miss Seefried recorded most of her operatic repertory and several albums of lieder.         She is survived by her husband and two daughters.       
        Pannonica de Koenigswarter, a patron of jazz performers, died Wednesday of heart failure at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 74 years old.         Pannonica de Koenigswarter, a patron of jazz performers, died Wednesday of heart failure at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 74 years old.         The Baroness de Koenigswarter offered sustanance and care to many musicians who needed help. The saxophonist Charlie Parker died in her home in 1955, and the composer and pianist Thelonious Monk lived there from 1970 until his death in 1982. Recently she had been influential in helping Barry Harris's Jazz Cultural Theater to survive.         A member of the English branch of the Rothschilds, Baroness de Koenigswarter moved to the United States in the early 1950's. As a teen-ager she had fallen in love with jazz, and she quickly became a part of the jazz world. She counted among her friends Charlie Rouse, who also died Wednesday; Coleman Hawkins, Tommy Flanagan, Barry Harris and many other important jazz musicians. They returned her affection: Mr. Monk wrote the tune ''Pannonica'' for her; the pianist Horace Silver wrote ''Nica's Dream'' and the saxophonist Gigi Gryce wrote ''Nica's Tempo.''         She is survived by three daughters, two sons and one grandchild. There is to be a memorial service on Dec. 11 at St. Peter's Church, 54th Street and Lexington Avenue.
