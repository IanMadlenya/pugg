         One of the most elegant tennis players ever to grace a grass court, Sarah Palfrey Danzig, a mainstay on the international circuit in the 1930's and an esteemed ambassador of the game thereafter, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 83.         The cause was lung cancer, her husband, Jerry A. Danzig, said.         In addition to being active in the Boston social registry from the 1930's to the 50's, she and her four sisters all claimed national tennis titles at varying points of their lives. But she was the only member of the brood who continued to have a significant impact on the tennis scene upon making the transition from junior to the adult ranks.         In all, Danzig collected 18 Grand Slam titles, most of them in doubles where, because of her uncommon artistry around the net, she was a coveted partner in women's as well as mixed doubles competitions. And her beatific courtside manner made her a favorite with spectators in the United States and abroad, where she garnered 24 titles.         Danzig was born in Sharon, Mass., on Sept. 18, 1912. Early on, she received the attention and instruction of Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman, the progenitor of the international Wightman Cup competition between teams from the United States and  Britain, and a front-runner in making the volley an essential component of women's tennis.         As a result of that association, Danzig not only excelled at the net, but she was also selected to be a member of 10 Wightman Cup teams. Her doubles partners  there -- Helen Jacobs, Helen Wills Moody and Alice Marble -- constituted a veritable Who's Who of women's tennis.         The United States National champion in singles in 1941 and again in 1945, Danzig ranked among the world's top 10 women on six occasions between 1933 and '39. She was the United States doubles champion nine times and captured the Wimbledon doubles title, alongside the equally glamorous Marble, in 1938 and '39.         Danzig rose to prominence on the national scene as a teen-ager. At 14, she won the Junior Grass Court Doubles in 1927 and she began dominating both singles and doubles junior events the following year. By the time she acquired her last  amateur national title in 1945 at a doubles clay-court championship where her partner was Elwood Cooke, the second of her three husbands, Danzig possessed a total of 63 national titles.         "Sarah certainly had all the elements of grace and charm and played a very stylish game," said Virginia Wade, the 1977 Wimbledon champion, who benefited from Danzig's support while still a rookie. "She always treated newcomers to the game as if they were one of the family, and she was a wonderful role model,"         Danzig briefly turned professional in 1947 for an exhibition tour with Pauline Betz before switching her attention to a business career in which she also thrived. Besides performing charitable duties on a revolving list of social committees, Danzig worked for NBC television as a sports editor from 1956 to '57, and in 1965 became an advertising consultant for World Tennis magazine.         Her method for attracting advertising to the magazine was unique and ahead of its time. Instead of wooing corporate clients with the traditional martini luncheon, the health-conscious Danzig booked weekly court time at a mid-Manhattan facility and supervised vigorous tennis matches among writers, editors and business executives. She herself played recreational tennis well into her 70's.         The author of two instructional tennis books, "Winning Tennis and How to Play It" (1946) and "Tennis for Anyone" (1966), Danzig was elected to the sport's Hall of Fame in 1963. This year, a permanent exhibit in her honor will be incorporated into its collection.         She is survived by her husband and two children, Diana Dupont of Hudson, N.H., and Jerry P., of New York, and two sisters, Polly Woodrow of San Jose, Calif., and Joanna Brown of Canton, Mass.       
         Lila Perlstein of Roslyn Heights, L.I., a top bridge player, died yesterday in North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 70 and had cancer, said her son, Jay Perlstein of Pleasantville, N.Y.         Mrs. Perlstein was already ill last year when she placed 16th in the American Contract Bridge League's National Player of the Year standings. She was second among female players, behind a regular partner, Juanita Chambers of Schenectady, N.Y. They won the National Women's Pair Championship in Phoenix in March, and, with others, the National Women's Knockout Team Championship in Atlanta in August.         Mrs. Perlstein won many regional titles and was second in the National Women's Teams in 1976. At one time she was co-owner of the North Shore Bridge Club in Roslyn Heights.         Mrs. Perlstein was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Cornell University in  1945. She is survived by her son and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Helene Wickham Koon, an author, scholar of 18th-century dramatic literature and former professor of English at California State University in San Bernardino, died on Feb. 13 at her home in Hollywood. She was 71.         The cause was emphysema, said Bernard P. Wiesen, a friend.         Dr. Koon was born in Minneapolis, and graduated from the University of Iowa. She pursued an earlier career as an actress, director and writer for theaters and radio stations in California and New Mexico. She opted for academia, however, and in 1969 earned a doctorate in English at the University of California in Los Angeles.         That year she joined the faculty of what was then California State College and was appointed a full professor in 1978. She also served as chairwoman of the department from 1975 to 1980.         Dr. Koon was the author of biographies of Colley Cibber, an English actor and dramatist (1671-1757), and Eugene Scribe, the French playwright (1791-1861). She also published "How Shakespeare Won the West," a study of Shakespearean stage productions during the Gold Rush, and "Dictionary of Gold Rush Performers, " among other books.         The author of numerous articles, she wrote poems and translated French literature and plays.         She is survived by her husband, Charles J. Koon; five sons, Christopher, Robin, Gavin, Nicholas and Lachlan; and six grandchildren.       
         Dr. Jane Marion Oppenheimer, a biologist and science historian whose interests ranged from embryos to the physiological effects of weightlessness in  space, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia after a brief illness. She was 84.         She retired in 1980 as the Kenan Professor Emeritus of Biology and History of Science at Bryn Mawr College, where she had taught and done research for more than four decades. But she continued to teach, write, edit and experiment for several more years and was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences  in 1992 in recognition of her contributions.         Many of Dr. Oppenheimer's scientific papers dealt with experimental embryology, the history of embryology, the development of the central nervous system of fishes and the history of science, particularly 18th-century medicine  in Britain.         Among her books were "Essays in the History of Embryology and Biology" (1967) and "Foundations of Experimental Embryology" (2d edition, 1974). She also edited the English version, in 1986, of "The Autobiography of Karl Ernst von Baer (1792-1876)," about a German-born doctor and anthropologist who had doubts about Darwin's approach to evolution.         She created one of four American scientific experiments done aboard a Soviet  satellite in the first American-Soviet space venture. Using killifish, a small bony junkfish, she helped analyze the effects of weightlessness on the physiology of fish eggs at five stages of their evolution. The work brought her awards from the two nations in 1975: the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Achievement Award and the Soviet Kosmos Award.         Dr. Oppenheimer also won the Wilbur Cross Medal from the Yale Graduate Alumni Association. She was a president of the American Society of Zoologists and an officer in the American Association for the Advancement of Science.         Born in Philadelphia, she was a 1936 graduate of Bryn Mawr and earned a Ph.D. in zoology at Yale University. She returned to Bryn Mawr as an instructor in 1938.         She leaves no immediate family.       
         Lola Beltran, the soulful Mexican singer whose achingly emotional renditions  of mariachi ballads made her known as Lola the Great to generations of Latin Americans, died on Sunday night in Mexico City. During a career that spanned five decades, she made a point of refusing to discuss her age, but she was believed to be in her mid-60's.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Maria Elena Leal, said in newspaper reports.         Among Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, Lola la Grande was held in high esteem for her ability to capture and reproduce in her music what they consider the melancholy essence of life. Song after song found her confronting suffering, loneliness, abandonment or loss with an equanimity that her millions of listeners in the Spanish-speaking world found inspiring and deeply moving.         In a tribute to Ms. Beltran written in 1994, the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes declared that "passion and desire, joy and risk, tenderness and the cry  for existence are the wings of this dove that is the voice of our lady Lola Beltran." Like most Mexicans, he added, "I have spent my life living and writing and loving and traveling with the voice of Lola Beltran close to me, on records, over the airwaves, but above all in the soundtrack of memory."         Ms. Beltran suffered a heart attack on March 16 and had been hospitalized, but she vowed to keep singing "as long as the body holds up." Revived by doctors after her heart had stopped beating for a reported seven minutes, she remarked,  "I fought death with all my might, and God in His infinite compassion has let me live for a little while longer."         Though Ms. Beltran's devotees ranged from presidents to peasants, she was especially admired by her fellow musicians. Her remarkable sense of phrasing, inflection and drama influenced a whole generation of younger vocalists, both men and women, inside and out of Mexico.         "Singers don't come any more real than Lola Beltran," Linda Ronstadt said in  1988 after releasing an album that included several songs associated with Ms. Beltran. "She's a world-class singer, up there rubbing shoulders with Billie Holiday and Edith Piaf."         In both her private and professional life, Ms. Beltran played the role of diva to the hilt. She dressed extravagantly, was fond of furs and ornate jewels  and relished the deference her admirers showered on her. She consequently earned a second nickname, "La Reina," or "The Queen."         Onstage, whether performing for Mexican immigrants at county fairs in Texas or at state dinners for Dwight D. Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle or the King of Spain, her bearing was indeed regal. She would halt her orchestra in mid-measure with an authoritative wave of the hand, or in moments of great emotion clutch the rebozo, or shawl, that was her trademark.         Her origins, however, were modest. Maria Lucila Beltran was born in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa, where her father, Pedro Beltran, was a mine manager. Her mother, a housewife who liked to sing around the house, exposed her daughter both to the hits of the day and older standards.         In her early years, Ms. Beltran sang at family gatherings or to the Carmelite nuns who educated her. But in 1953, with her mother, Maria de los Angeles Ruiz,  in tow as her chaperone, Ms. Beltran moved to Mexico City with hopes of entering show business. She took a secretarial job at XEW, a radio station known throughout Mexico as the home of the Mariachi Vargas, the most popular group of  the genre.         Ms. Beltran later would tell how she pestered the group until they gave her a chance to show off her vocal skills. The purity of her voice and her masterly technique immediately won them over, and within a year she was the star of her own program and the most popular female mariachi singer in Mexico. "Even now, every time I go by the station, I make the sign of the cross," she said in a 1988 interview, as a gesture of gratitude for good fortune.         Through the Mariachi Vargas, Ms. Beltran also met Tomas Mendez, the songwriter who would go on to compose many of her most successful songs. Several of those numbers, "Cucurrucucu Paloma" and "Tres Dias" in particular, became hits everywhere -- the United States included -- and made Ms. Beltran a star throughout the Spanish-speaking world.         "When I hear a song, I want it to tell me something," Ms. Beltran said in the same interview. "It can tell the story of a great love or of a tremendous sadness, but it has to have emotion and truth. The song has to make it worth my  while to sing it."         Though many of Ms. Beltran's contemporaries have long since faded from the scene, she maintained her appeal among those who consider themselves hip and contemporary. The Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar, for instance, used Ms.  Beltran's version of "Soy Infeliz," or "I Am Unhappy," as the opening theme of his 1988 hit, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown."         All told, Ms. Beltran recorded more than 100 albums, with total sales estimated in the tens of millions. She also appeared in more than 50 movies, most of them Mexican musicals of indifferent quality that owed their commercial  success to her remarkable popularity and her dark, keening voice.         Ms. Beltran is survived by her daughter, born of her marriage to the bullfighter and actor Alfredo Leal.       
         Mary Lavin, whose short stories and novels about the conflicts in the hearts  of her fellow Irish men and women transcended mere tales of life in Ireland, died on Monday at a nursing home here. She was 83.         Ms. Lavin was the author of 19 collections of short stories and three novels. She won three Guggenheim Fellowships and a number of literary awards, including  the Katherine Mansfield Prize, in 1961. Her stories appeared regularly in The New Yorker.         Her death was front-page news in The Irish Times, whose chief book critic, Eileen Battersby, called her "one of modern Irish fiction's most subversive voices" and said, "Her art explored often brutal tensions, disappointments and frustrations dictating the relationships within so-called 'normal' families."         Ms. Lavin's favorite form was the short story, which she once likened to "a flash of lightning lighting up the whole landscape all at once." In a 1976 interview she was quoted as saying: "Publishers are definitely unfair to short-story writers. Since the essence of the short story is its conciseness, an addiction to change is an occupational disease and not the self-indulgence publishers think." She also said: "I don't think a story has to have a beginning, middle and end. I think of it more as an arrow in flight."         Critics often compared Ms. Lavin's work to that of other acclaimed Irish writers, including Liam O'Flaherty and Sean O'Faolain, and also perceived echoes of Balzac, Chekhov and Saki. Her writing influenced the work of others, as well, including the novelist William Trevor.         Ms. Lavin said her childhood reading of Jane Austen influenced her writing. She said that, as a realist, her writing was "only looking closer than normal into the human heart, whose vagaries and contrarieties have their own integral design." In an appreciation in The Irish Times, Maurice Harmon, professor emeritus of Anglo-Irish Literature at University College in Dublin, wrote: "She  drew upon her own experience. Her stories explore and reflect the patterns of her life: the return of the little girl from America to the strange, puritanical society of her mother's people" in Western Ireland.         "At the high point of her career," he continued, "she wrote about widows who  refuse to be passive in the face of death, who keep their memories of love and go forth to encounter experience with openness and with the wisdom of years."         Mary Lavin was born on June 11, 1912, of immigrant parents in East Walpole, Mass. When she was 10 the family moved back to Athenry, in Western Ireland. She  wrote her first short story in 1938. Her first collection, "Tales From Bective Bridge," won the James Tate Black Memorial Prize in 1942 and helped establish her career.         Her short-story collections include "The Long Ago" (1944), "The Becker Wives" (1946), "A Single Lady" (1957), "In the Middle of the Fields" (1966) and "The Shrine and Other Stories" (1976). She published her first novel, "The House in Clewe Street," in 1945; her second, "Mary O'Grady," appeared in 1950.         She served as president of the Irish Academy of Letters in 1971.         Ms. Lavin's first marriage was to William Walsh, a lawyer, who died in 1954.  They had three daughters, who survive. In 1969 she married Michael McDonald Scott, a former Roman Catholic priest, who died in 1990. In recent years her health failed and she lived in a nursing home.         Her stories were characterized by arresting opening and closing lines. One story, "Happiness," begins with "Mother had a lot to say" and ends: "Mother made the last effort of her life and grasped at Bea's meaning. She let out a sigh, and, closing her eyes, she sank back, and this time her head sank so deep into the pillow that it would have been dented had it been a pillow of stone." Another, "A Memory," begins, "James did all right for a man on his own," and ends, "Under a weight of bitterness too great to be borne, his face was pressed  into the wet leaves and, when he gulped for breath, the rotted leaves were sucked into his mouth."       
         Erma Bombeck, who mined the everyday lives of housewives and parents for the  mother lode of humor that transformed her into one of the country's most popular newspaper columnists and a best-selling author, died yesterday at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center. Mrs. Bombeck, who made her home in Paradise Valley, Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix, was 69.         Mrs. Bombeck, afflicted for years with polycystic kidney disease, a hereditary ailment, underwent a kidney transplant this month at the hospital, which said she died of complications after the surgery.         Three times a week until about two years ago, and more recently on a twice-weekly schedule, Mrs. Bombeck did what she had done since 1964: sifted greasy ovens, voracious washing machines, sibling rivalry and the predilections  of couch-potato spouses for the nuggets of mirth that won her the devotion of readers who followed her 500- to 600-word columns in some 600 newspapers.         "My type of humor is almost pure identification," she said. "A housewife reads my column and says, 'But that's happened to me! I know just what she's talking about!' "         Fans appreciated Mrs. Bombeck's slapstick approach to housekeeping and family relations.         *Dirty ovens: "If it won't catch fire today, clean it tomorrow."         *The dilemmas of sibling rivalry: "Who gets the fruit cocktail with the lone  cherry on top?"         *Affairs: "If a woman is ever to have an affair, it will be in March. Psychologically, it is a perfect month. The bowling tournaments are over. The white sales on bedding are past. Your chest cold has stabilized and the Avon lady is beginning to look like Tom Jones."         *Male habits: "If a man watches 16 consecutive quarters of football, he can be declared legally dead."         *Housework: "My second favorite household chore is ironing. My first being hitting my head on the top bunk bed until I faint."         *Teen-agers: "Don't ever say you understand them. It breaks down the hostile  relationship between you that it takes to understand one another."         Even at the pinnacle of success, earning $500,000 to $1 million a year, Mrs.  Bombeck made cleaning house, grocery shopping and cooking dinner a part of her weekly routine. "If I didn't do my own housework, then I have no business writing about it," she said. "I spend 90 percent of my time living scripts and 10 percent writing them."         Besides her columns, distributed at the time of her death by the Universal Press Syndicate in Kansas City, Mo., Mrs. Bombeck was the author of more than a  dozen books, including popular successes with titles like "The Grass Is Always Greener Over the Septic Tank" (1976), "If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I  Doing in the Pits?" (1978) and "Motherhood: The Second Oldest Profession" (1983).         From 1975 to 1986 she appeared twice a week on "Good Morning America" on the  ABC network. At various times, she wrote a monthly column for Good Housekeeping, contributed to magazines like Reader's Digest, Family Circle, Redbook and McCall's; lectured; created, wrote and produced the short-lived 1981 ABC television series "Maggie" and saw "The Grass Is Always Greener" turned into a 1978 prime-time CBS television movie starring Carol Burnett as a concerned mother who was Mrs. Bombeck's alter ego and Charles Grodin as her husband.         In 1988, after her previous five books had sold more than 15 million copies,  she signed a three-book contract with Harper & Row valued by publishing experts  at $12 million.         Mrs. Bombeck was a housewife and mother, living outside Dayton in Centerville, Ohio, and advancing toward 40 when she determined to change her life.         "That's when I used to sit at the kitchen window, year after year, watching women like Ruth Gordon, Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Golda Meir carving out their own careers," she said. "I decided that it wasn't fulfilling to clean chrome faucets with a toothbrush. At 37, I decided it was my time to strike out.         In 1964, after the last of her three children started school, she began writing columns. She was, she said, "too old for a paper route, too young for Social Security and too tired for an affair."         Erma Louise Fiste was born Feb. 21, 1927, in Dayton. When she was 9, her father, a crane operator named Cassius Fiste, died of a heart attack at 42. "One day you were a family, living in a little house at the bottom of a hill," she said. "The next day it was all gone."         Mrs. Bombeck, who began writing a humor column at Emerson Junior High in Dayton, worked as a copy girl for The Dayton Journal-Herald after graduating from high school in 1944. She became a reporter there after graduating from the  University of Dayton with a bachelor of arts degree in 1949, the same year she married William Bombeck, a sportswriter who became a high school principal.         Mrs. Bombeck said she chose the subject of her columns because "being a housewife was the only thing in life I could discuss for more than 10 minutes."         She persuaded Ron Ginger, the editor of The Kettering-Oakwood Times, a suburban weekly, to pay her $3 a column, and she was on her way.         In 1992, Mrs. Bombeck underwent a mastectomy after cancer was diagnosed in a  breast, and not long afterward, as her kidneys failed, she began undergoing dialysis at her home.         In addition to her husband, who lives in Paradise Valley, and her mother, Erma Harris, of Sun City, Ariz., Mrs. Bombeck is survived by her three children: Betsy and Andrew, of Phoenix and Matthew, of Los Angeles.       
         Lynn O'Donnell, the producer of the documentary film "Crumb," died in San Francisco on April 17. She was 43. The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Lawrence Wilkinson.         Ms. O'Donnell produced and directed several films, but her greatest critical  success came with "Crumb," a dark portrait of the underground cartoonist Robert  Crumb and his family. Directed by Terry Zwigoff, it won the top prize for documentaries at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival.         Ms. O'Donnell was born in Berkeley, Calif. After earning a degree in film making from San Francisco State University, she worked as an editor in Vienna on the television mini-series "Holocaust" and on German feature films. From 1977 to 1980 she worked at KQED, the San Francisco public television station, where she  became head of production.         After leaving KQED, she produced and directed "Voices of the Tango," a documentary about the Argentine tango singer Carlos Gardel, and produced "Czeslaw Milosz: The Poet Remembers," which was directed by Jan Nemec. She also  produced "Living on Tokyo Time," the first feature by the director Steven Okazaki.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Nora; her parents, Virginia and Ashton O'Donnell, of Woodside, Calif., and three sisters, Sherry Burns, of Cupertino, Calif.; Joan, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Jennifer Conner, of San Rafael, Calif.         Correction:  April 30, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about the producer of the documentary film "Crumb" misspelled her surname in some references. She was Lynn O'Donnell, not O'Connell       
         Barbara McLean, an Oscar-winning Hollywood film editor whose influence at 20th Century-Fox extended far beyond the cutting room, died on March 28 at a convalescent home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 92 and had lived in Newport Beach since her retirement in 1969 after 20 years as head of the studio's editing division.         One of the first women to work as a film editor in Hollywood, Miss McLean, who began as an assistant in the 1920's and cut her first movie, "Gallant Lady," in 1933, knew her place:         For decades it was in the chair next to Darryl F. Zanuck, the Fox studio chief, who relied so much on the judgment of the woman he called Bobby that he rarely made a major decision on anything from costumes to casting without consulting her first.         And when he did, arguments tended to cease. Studio executives knew that when  Mr. Zanuck prefaced a statement with "Bobby says . . . ," he wasn't expressing an opinion but announcing a decision.         There was the time in 1936, for example, when Mr. Zanuck and other executives were watching screen tests, trying to decide between two actors for a leading role. When the projection room lights went up, Mr. Zanuck turned to Miss McLean  as usual, and as usual she didn't disappoint: Don Ameche was good, she said, but the other fellow looked more dashing in the movie's costumes.         "Bobby says . . . ," said Mr. Zanuck, and Tyrone Power got the part in "LLoyd's of London" that made him a star.         Miss McLean, whose scores of credits included "All About Eve," "12 O'Clock High," "The Robe" and "Tobacco Road," won an Academy Award in 1944 for her work  on the documentary "Wilson," a biography of Woodrow Wilson.         But for all her undisputed skills, Miss McLean had to break through entrenched sexual stereotypes to get a job in the first place.         Although other women worked as editors in the 1930's, including Dorothy Spencers, Marjorie Fowler, Margaret Booth and Ada Warren, editing was considered man's work.         In the division of Hollywood labor, women might work as actresses, seamstresses, secretaries or even film lab technicians, where their nimble fingers were even deemed to give them an advantage in the delicate task of cutting and splicing film to a male editor's specifications.         Miss McLean's fingers were as nimble as anyone's, and no wonder. She had been cutting and splicing since she was a teen-ager working in the film lab that her  father, Charles Pollut, operated near the family's home in Palisades Park, N.J.         After she married Gordon McLean, a projectionist, the couple went to Hollywood in 1924. Miss McLean found work as a film technician, then worked as an assistant editor for a number of studios, and in the early 1930's began the long association with Mr. Zanuck, who inevitably selected her to edit his personal productions at Fox.         Miss McLean, whose early marriage ended in divorce, married the director Robert Webb in 1951 after working with him on the movie "David and Bathsheba." Mr. Webb died several years ago.         She is survived by a stepson, James Webb, of Payson, Ariz.       
         Greer Garson, the actress who epitomized a noble, wise and courageous wife in some of the sleekest and most sentimental American movies of the 1940's, died yesterday morning at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. She was 92.         Miss Garson, who had a history of heart problems, had lived at the long-term-care hospital for the last three years, according to Ann Harper, a spokeswoman at the hospital.         Miss Garson became an instant success as a captivating young wife in the sentimental 1939 film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips." She was nominated for an Academy Award for this first film performance and quickly became one of the 10 most popular Hollywood stars.         She received five more Oscar nominations in five years for self-sacrificing portrayals in "Blossoms in the Dust" (1941), "Mrs. Miniver" (1942), "Madame Curie" (1943), "Mrs. Parkington" (1944) and "The Valley of Decision" (1945). She won the best actress Oscar for "Mrs. Miniver," in which she superbly symbolized  the spirit and virtue of a British homemaker in wartime.         With much of the earth ravaged by World War II, the Scotch-Irish actress with titian hair, blue-green eyes and alabaster complexion filled a need for a dignified and intrepid wife-mother figure. Her portrayals were so proper that one sequence in "Random Harvest," a major dramatic hit of 1942, created a sensation when she was allowed to wear kilts and show her shapely legs. Otherwise, she was heavily costumed and wholesomely typecast by Louis B. Mayer.         After the war, because of inferior vehicles and changing tastes, she was unable to escape the mold.         Nonetheless, in her Broadway debut in 1958, Miss Garson won acclaim in a comedy, succeeding Rosalind Russell as the devil-may-care "Auntie Mame." Two years later, Miss Garson received a seventh Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in the film "Sunrise at Campobello."         While preparing for "Auntie Mame" she told an interviewer: "I'm tired of playing four-handkerchief heroines in crinoline roles. I think there's a little  bit of 'Auntie Mame' in every woman -- a kind of counterpart to the 'Walter Mitty' in every man. I think Mrs. Miniver and Auntie Mame would have gotten along real well. Mame's really a doll. She promoted a liveliness and kindliness, and isn't that the best one can do?"         Early on, the actress enjoyed peerless popularity. Nine of her first 11 movies opened at Radio City Music Hall and played at that premier movie palace a total of 64 weeks. In 1978, Vincent Canby of The New York Times offered a tribute in which he deemed Miss Garson "emblematic of everything the Music Hall offered its patrons."         "In her high-toned M-G-M pictures she was invariably serene, polite, elegant  in a slightly unreal way, too good to be true, always prepared to meet any emergency and staunchly middle-class," Mr. Canby continued. "Her pictures were neither inhibited by the Hall nor did they ever look tacky amid all that splendor. Actress and theater were one."         Greer Garson was born on Sept. 29, 1903, in County Down, Northern Ireland, of Presbyterian parents. Her father, George Garson, a businessman, died soon after, and she and her mother, Nina, moved to London. The name Greer was a contraction  of MacGregor, her mother's ancestral name.         She was a frail girl with chronic bronchitis who was comfortable with her many adult relatives but uneasy with people her own age. She recalled a childhood of scrimping, study and an abiding ambition to act despite her family's pressure on her to teach. She received full scholarships from a county  school and from the University of London, where she won honors studying French and 18th-century literature in an accelerated course, with secretarial classes for a backup.         Miss Garson obtained a secure post as a market researcher for a London advertising firm, but gave it up to study acting with the Birmingham Repertory Theater during two years in the provinces, where she received increasingly         favorable notices.         She polished her craft during two years in the West End, starring in eight plays, including Shaw's "Too True to Be Good," and became one of Britain's ablest young stage actresses. Most of the plays were flops, but she was praised  for her talent, drive and professionalism. Envious associates dubbed her Ca-Reer Garson, a tag that trailed her to Hollywood.         In one theater audience in 1938 was the head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Riveted  by her performance, Mayer persuaded her to sign a movie contract for an uncommonly high starting salary of $500 a week. She confirmed his faith by her performance in "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" and further confirmed her skill in an effervescent 1940 film version of Jane Austen's novel "Pride and Prejudice," co-starring Laurence Olivier.         Miss Garson then entered her wartime phase of idealized helpmates, appearing  regularly with Walter Pidgeon. She inherited the mantle of M-G-M's First Lady from Norma Shearer, who had retired, and was indelibly typecast as what she ironically called "Metro's Glorified Mrs."         Her postwar, mostly unsuccessful, movies included "Adventure" (1946), co-starring Clark Gable; "That Forsythe Woman" (1949), with Errol Flynn and Mr.  Pidgeon, and the cameo role of Calpurnia in "Julius Caesar" (1953). In later years, she co-produced several plays in New York, including "On Golden Pond."         Miss Garson's marriages to Edward A. A. Snelson, a British civil servant, and to Richard Ney, an actor 10 years her junior who had played her son in "Mrs. Miniver," ended in divorce. In 1949, she married E. E. (Buddy) Fogelson, an oil  developer and industrialist. The Fogelsons had homes in Dallas and Los Angeles and a ranch outside Santa Fe, N.M., where they were civic leaders. Mr. Fogelson  died in 1987.         The actress's recreations included raising cattle and domestic animals as well as gardening and fishing. She continued to support the performing arts, giving $10 million to Southern Methodist University in Dallas for the Greer Garson Theater, which opened in September 1992. Asked once if she missed Hollywood, she replied: "No. I have at long last learned to be interested in where I am."         She is survived by a stepson, Gayle D. Fogelson, of Dallas.       
         Barbara McLean, an Oscar-winning Hollywood film editor whose influence at 20th Century-Fox extended far beyond the cutting room, died on March 28 at a convalescent home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 92 and had lived in Newport Beach since her retirement in 1969 after 20 years as head of the studio's editing division.         One of the first women to work as a film editor in Hollywood, Miss McLean, who began as an assistant in the 1920's and cut her first movie, "Gallant Lady," in 1933, knew her place.         For decades it was in the chair next to Darryl F. Zanuck, the Fox studio chief, who relied so much on the judgment of the woman he called Bobby that he rarely made a major decision on anything from costumes to casting without consulting her first.         And when he made a decision, arguments tended to cease. Studio executives knew that when Mr. Zanuck prefaced a statement with "Bobby says . . . " he was not expressing an opinion but announcing a decision.         There was the time in 1936, for example, when Mr. Zanuck and other executives were watching screen tests, trying to decide between two actors for a leading role. When the projection room lights went up, Mr. Zanuck turned to Miss McLean  as usual, and as usual she did not disappoint: Don Ameche was good, she said, but the other fellow looked more dashing in the movie's costumes.         "Bobby says . . . " Mr. Zanuck said, and Tyrone Power got the part in "Lloyd's of London" that made him a star.         Miss McLean, whose scores of credits included "All About Eve," "12 O'Clock High," "The Robe" and "Tobacco Road," won an Academy Award in 1944 for her work  on the documentary "Wilson," a biography of Woodrow Wilson.         But for all her undisputed skills, Miss McLean had to break through entrenched sexual stereotypes to get a job in the first place.         Although other women worked as editors in the 1930's, including Dorothy Spencers, Marjorie Fowler, Margaret Booth and Ada Warren, editing was considered man's work.         In the division of Hollywood labor, women might work as actresses, seamstresses, secretaries or even film laboratory technicians, where their nimble fingers were even deemed to give them an advantage in the delicate task of cutting and splicing film to a male editor's specifications.         Miss McLean's fingers were as nimble as anyone's, and no wonder. She had been cutting and splicing since she was a teen-ager working in the film lab that her  father, Charles Pollut, operated near the family's home in Palisades Park, N.J.         After she married Gordon McLean, a projectionist, the couple went to Hollywood in 1924. Miss McLean found work as a film technician, then worked as an assistant editor for a number of studios, and in the early 1930's began the long association with Mr. Zanuck, who inevitably selected her to edit his personal productions at Fox.         Miss McLean, whose early marriage ended in divorce, married the director Robert Webb in 1951 after working with him on the movie "David and Bathsheba." Mr. Webb died several years ago.         She is survived by a stepson, James Webb, of Payson, Ariz.       
         Ilka Tanya Payan, the Dominican-born soap opera star and New York civic leader who played a reluctant but eloquent role in raising AIDS awareness after  disclosing that she was infected with the H.I.V. virus, died on Saturday at her  home in Manhattan. She was 53.         A friend, Carla Fine, said the cause was AIDS.         Although she won wide popularity with her portrayal of the villainous Carmen Delia in the Spanish-language television soap opera "Angelica, Mi Vida" ("Angelica, My Life"), Ms. Payan, who came to New York in 1956 and had appeared  in Spanish-language theatrical productions in New York and elsewhere, had already moved onto a broader stage by the time she made her startling announcement in 1993.         Fearing she would not be able to support herself as an actress indefinitely,  she had become a lawyer in 1981 and had begun a practice in immigration law that drew her increasingly into public affairs, partly because of a column on immigration matters she wrote for El Diario La Prensa.         By 1992, she had become so prominent in Hispanic political and civic circles  that Mayor David N. Dinkins named her to the city's Commission on Human Rights,  a position she relinquished when Mr. Dinkins left office.         When she held a news conference in October 1993, to disclose that she was H.I.V.-positive, her announcement sent shock waves through much of Latin America, particularly the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.         That was partly, she said, because there was such ignorance about AIDS among  the Hispanic populations, and such a stigma associated with the disease, that few Hispanic performers with H.I.V. had been willing to risk public disgrace by  acknowledging their infections.         It was precisely for those reasons, Ms. Payan said, that she had kept her own infection a secret for seven years. The virus, she said, had been detected in her system in 1986, five years after she had been infected by a lover who was an intravenous drug user.         "I wasn't ready to take on H.I.V. and society's rejection," she said, noting  that she had spent years working as a staff lawyer for Gay Men's Health Crisis not because of her own infection but because of the many friends in the theater  who had died of AIDS.         It was a measure of the degree of social rejection of people with AIDS that her own three sisters stopped talking to her after she made her announcement. In response, Ms. Payan assigned herself as a messenger of enlightment.         "My message is, 'Look at me,' " she said in 1993. "I'm a relatively healthy woman. Why must I be looked on as a pariah? I won't accept it."         And she did not. As a spokeswoman for the battle against AIDS, Ms. Payan made numerous public appearances and was widely interviewed by Spanish-language news  organizations.         She also received numerous awards for her work, among them a Medal of Honor presented to her by President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic.         For Ms. Payan, however, there was a more cherished sign that her message was  getting through: since her announcement in 1993, her friend Ms. Fine said yesterday, her three sisters had reconciled with her.         Ms. Payan, who was divorced, is survived by her daughter, Genevieve Gabrielle Gazon of Manhattan, and her sisters, Luisia Payan of Manhattan, Marva Payan of Orange City, Fla., and Lil Palau of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.       
         Mary Perot Nichols, the strong-willed former head of the television and radio stations operated by New York City, and a former columnist and city editor of The Village Voice, died yesterday in the hospice of the Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69.         She died of pancreatic cancer, her family said.         A friend and ally of Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor, for 40 years, Ms. Nichols twice served as president of the WNYC Communications Group, with two radio stations, WNYC-AM and WNYC-FM, and a television station, WNYC-TV, Channel  31, licensed and partly financed by the city.         Ms. Nichols's most lasting professional contribution may have been the creation of the WNYC Foundation in the late 1970's, founded to attract private funds so the communications group could survive despite dwindling city financing. The foundation is awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission to buy WNYC-AM and FM, which are to remain public stations. Last week, the F.C.C. cleared the way for the city to sell the commercial license for WNYC-TV to the ITT Corporation and Dow Jones, which plan to create a sports, financial and entertainment superstation.         Under Ms. Nichols's leadership, the radio station became an important contributor to the city's cultural life and a major producer of programs for National Public Radio, including "Kids America," a live call-in program for children that won several broadcasting awards.         Mayor Koch first appointed Ms. Nichols to head WNYC Communications in 1978 on the heels of the city's fiscal crisis, when budget-conscious politicians called  for sale of the stations. She not only kept them going but also began station renovations.         When she resigned after two years to become director of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, she tossed off a tart farewell: doing creative work  for the city-owned stations was, she said, "a little like trying to cook a gourmet meal with glue on the kitchen floor."         Ms. Nichols left WNYC because of a disagreement with Mayor Koch when he insisted that the radio station run "The John Hour," in which the names of nine  men convicted of patronizing prostitutes were read over WNYC-AM. Mr. Koch theorized that the embarrassing exposure would cut into the prostitution trade and also argued that the Mayor should be allowed to control programming. "The John Hour" ran only once, but there was an outcry, and Ms. Nichols was made "uncomfortable," Mr. Koch said.         But he wooed her back to lead the communications group from 1983 to 1990, when Mayor David N. Dinkins replaced her with his own choice. She then became a  visiting professor of journalism at New York University, a post she held until her death.         Born in York, Pa., Mary Perot grew up near Philadelphia and in Buffalo. Friends say her Main Line family offered her a choice: she could have a "coming-out tea" or a college education. She selected college and in 1948 graduated from Swarthmore College with a degree in political science.         She lived with her husband and three children in Greenwich Village, and was involved in local issues, particularly the effort to stop Robert Moses from putting a road through Washington Square Park. She kept nudging Dan Wolf, a founding editor of The Village Voice, to write about the park. He encouraged her to write about the danger to the park herself, and she did.         Soon she became a mainstay of the young newspaper, first as a reporter, then  as author of "Runnin' Scared," a column about city politics.         A competitive writer with a streak of indignation -- "Mary had the kind of anger that made abolitionists," said a former colleague, Jerry Tallmer, the writer -- she wrote extensively about organized crime and political corruption and was among the loudest critics of the Lower Manhattan Expressway and then Westway. Neither was built.         "Mary had spies everywhere," said Clark Whelton, a former Voice reporter who  is now a speechwriter for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "She seemed to know things  other people never found out. She would do the legwork herself, sit through long meetings, read documents nobody else would read, make connections nobody else would make."         Before she left the paper for good in the mid-1970's, she took two years off  to serve as a public relations aide in the city's Parks Department. It was a heady time, during Mayor John V. Lindsay's first term, and the energetic Parks Commissioner, Thomas P. F. Hoving, staged happenings -- concerts and other events to draw the public to the once placid parks.         "In the revolution of 1966, Mary was a key player," said Henry Stern, the current Commissioner of the Parks Department who was then its executive director. "Hoving was brand new to city government, but she knew all about it. He got the nickname Thomas P. F. Hoving, P. F. for Publicity Forever, but Mary Nichols made it happen."         Ms. Nichols soon grew disillusioned with Mr. Hoving and Mr. Lindsay, who became one of many favorite targets in her columns once she returned to The Voice in 1968.         As The Voice's city editor, she encouraged young writers and seemed to thrive on feuds with politicians and colleagues. Some accused her of trying to promote  the interests of Mr. Koch, her old friend. She acknowledged that she often agreed with him, but asserted that "when I disagreed with him, I let him have it."         Shortly after The Voice's founders sold it in the mid-1970's, a new editor dismissed Ms. Nichols. In 1977, she became communications director to Mayor Kevin S. White of Boston for just under a year. Then, after Mr. Koch's election  that year, she took on the WNYC job.         Ms. Nichols's marriage to Robert B. Nichols, a writer, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two daughters, Eliza Nichols of Williamsburg, Va., and Kerstin Nichols of Hartford, Vt.; a son, Duncan, of Thetford, Vt.; a brother, Charles Perot, and two grandchildren.       
         Eugenia Price, who turned a chance visit to coastal Georgia into a career as  the South's most popular writer of antebellum romantic fiction, died on Tuesday  at a hospital in Brunswick, Ga., not far from her home in St. Simons, the island she made famous through a series of novels. She was 79.         Her companion, Joyce Blackburn, said the cause was congestive heart failure.         Her hoop-skirted heroines tended to be too unremittingly beautiful, her handsome heroes a shade too dashing and their problems a bit too easily solved for Ms. Price to have won serious literary acclaim. But then again, how many acclaimed authors sell more than 40 million books in 18 languages?         That Ms. Price did just that was a tribute both to her ability as a storyteller and her knack for recreating a bygone era with such compelling and authentic historic detail that, according to the St. Simons's Chamber of Commerce, a substantial majority of the thousands of tourists who visit the island each year come there specifically to scout out the houses, marshes and other locales she used in her novels, not to mention the headstones of the actual people she brought back to life as fictional characters.         Ms. Price, a dentist's daughter from Charleston, W.Va., was a precocious student who entered Ohio University at 16 and later studied dentistry at Northwestern University before dropping out of school to pursue a writing career.         Those familiar with the intensely romantic themes of her fiction would not be surprised that she began her career writing soap operas, initially in Chicago and later in New York and Cincinnati, the headquarters of Procter & Gamble.         An intense conversion to Christianity in the late 1940's altered the course of her life and of her writing. Abandoning soap operas, she began turning out inspirational books -- among them "Discoveries," "Beloved World" and "The Eugenia Price Treasury of Faith" -- that won her a wide following long before she turned to fiction.         Indeed, it was while on a tour in 1960 to promote one of her two dozen inspirational titles that she and Ms. Blackburn, who had been living in Chicago, happened to stop off in St. Simons and were so enchanted by the beauty and ambiance of the place that they decided they never wanted to leave.         It was a measure of their immediate and intense devotion to the island that the two women bought cemetery plots there before they built the house they named Dodge after the real St. Simons clergyman who, with his two wives, became the focus of Ms. Price's first novels, "Lighthouse," "New Moon Rising" and "Beloved  Invader."         Those books were such a succcess that she wrote a Florida Trilogy and a Savannah Quartet before a turning out a final Georgia Trilogy, whose return to the familiar St. Simons settings helped propel the first book of the final series, "Bright Captivity" (1991), to The New York Times best-seller list. The third, "Beauty from Ashes" (1995), was also a best seller. Her last book, "The Waiting Time," is to be published next year by Doubleday.         Ms. Blackburn, a writer who subsumed her own career to serve as Ms. Price's live-in editor, is her only survivor.       
         Lily Auchincloss, a philanthropist and major supporter of the Museum of Modern Art, the American Academy in Rome and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Alexandra Herzan.         Mrs. Auchincloss was well known in New York cultural and social circles as an active and generous supporter of the arts with a keen interest in architecture and design.         A trustee at the Museum of Modern Art since 1971, she served on more than one-third of the museum's many trustee committees, including those of painting and sculpture, drawings and prints and illustrated books, and had been chairwoman of the museum's architecture and design committee since 1981.         In the 1990's, the several exhibitions she helped to finance included those of the architects Louis I. Kahn, Rem Koolhaus and Frank Lloyd Wright, as well as "Light Constructions" and "Cy Twombly: A Retrospective."         In 1994, the Modern named the Lily Auchincloss Center for Architecture and Design, a research facility, and 18 architects donated drawings to the collection in her honor. Terence Riley, chief curator of the department of art and architecture, said: "She was not a passive philanthropist. Her generosity came from a belief that the world could be a better and more beautiful place." Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern, said Mrs. Auchincloss was "one of the great, great trustees of our museum and involved with every aspect of its life."         Mrs. Auchincloss was born on April 5, 1922, in Newark. Her father, Arnold Louis van Ameringen, who was born in Holland, founded the International Flavors  and Fragrances Company. Her mother, Hedwig Pfaltz van Ameringen, who died last month at the age of 95, was a major supporter of the New York Philharmonic.         Although Mrs. Auchincloss's first cultural interest was music, her affinity for architecture and design was kindled at Radcliffe College, where she met Philip Johnson, formerly head of the department of architecture at the Museum of Modern Art, and the architect Marcel Breuer, with whom Mr. Johnson was studying  at Harvard. She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe in 1944.         From 1944 to 1958, Mrs. Auchincloss worked in New York City as an editor on magazines and newspapers, including Look, The World-Telegram, The Herald Tribune, Glamour, Harper's Bazaar and McCall's. In 1956, she married Douglas Auchincloss, a writer at Newsweek. They were divorced in 1979.         A lifelong Episcopalian, Mrs. Auchincloss became a trustee of St. John the Divine in 1975, where she founded a committee that supported the cathedral's presentations of art and music. She was especially interested in large free concerts and financed the first performance of Liszt's "Christus" Oratorio in 100 years in 1979 at the cathedral.         In 1991, Mrs. Auchincloss served on the jury for the competition for the design of the cathedral's new wing, which was won by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.         In 1977, Mrs. Auchincloss became the first woman to join the board of the Cooper Union. She also served on the board of Japan Society, and was a director  of the Municipal Arts Society and a Fellow for Life of the Morgan Library.         A member of the board of the American Academy in Rome since 1982, she was a major contributor to the renovation of the Academy's McKim, Meade & White building in Rome.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by a brother, Henry P. van Ameringen of Manhattan; a sister, Patricia Kind of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., and a granddaughter.       
         Jo Van Fleet, who won an Academy Award, a Tony Award and other honors for her portrayal of proud, stoical women, died yesterday at Jamaica Hospital in Queens. She was 81.         Ms. Van Fleet was known as an actress's actress, a highly skilled professional who worked with equal ease onstage, in films and on television. For her first screen appearance in 1955, she won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for playing James Dean's mother in Elia Kazan's film "East of Eden." Two years later, she won a Tony Award as best featured actress for her role as the irritable Jessie Mae Watts in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful."         In her other signature role, in Mr. Kazan's "Wild River," she was Ella Garth, an 80-year-old matriarch who refuses to leave her island home despite the fact that it is about to be flooded by the Tennessee Valley Authority. In that film, Montgomery Clift played a sympathetic Government official.         Over the years she came to be known for playing mothers of diverse ethnic backgrounds, with the range running from naturalistic drama to absurdist comedy. She was Anthony Perkins's mother in "Look Homeward, Angel" on Broadway; the original smothering mama, Madame Rosepettle, in Arthur Kopit's "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad," and Paul Newman's mother in the movie "Cool Hand Luke."         Her maternal gallery included the wicked stepmother in the 1965 television revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella." The same year, she followed Maureen Stapleton as Amanda Wingfield in the 20th-anniversary production of "The Glass Menagerie."         Ms. Van Fleet, who was a member of the Actors Studio, often credited Mr. Kazan with having a major influence on her career. In addition to their film work, he directed her onstage in George Tabori's "Flight Into Egypt" and Tennessee Williams's "Camino Real," in which she created the role of Camille.         She was born in Oakland, Calif., and began her theatrical training at the College of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif. After studying with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse, she made her New York debut in "The Winter's Tale" in 1946. In 1950, she played Regan to Louis Calhern's "King Lear." In the  1950's and 60's, she was often on Broadway and occasionally Off Broadway (in "Rosemary" and "The Alligators," a double bill by Molly Kazan).         With "East of Eden" she began a flourishing movie career. Her other films included "The Rose Tattoo," "I'll Cry Tomorrow," "A King and Four Queens," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral," "This Angry Age," "I Love You, Alice B. Toklas" and "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight." In the 1970's, she often acted in regional theater.         Ms. Van Fleet was married to William Bales, a dancer and choreographer who died in 1990.         She is survived by a son, Michael, of Toronto, and a granddaughter.       
         Theodora Ayer Randolph, who rode the Virginia hunt country long enough and well enough to become known as the first lady of fox hunting, died on Tuesday at her Oakley Farm home in Upperville, Va. She was 90.         It had been years since Mrs. Randolph had donned her dark-blue, gold-collared coat, tucked her auburn hair under her helmet and galloped off over the vast expanse of farmland that makes up the grounds of the 150-year-old landowners' association known as the Piedmont Hunt. But as a master of the Piedmont, she had remained an indispensable presence in the affairs of the nation's oldest and largest fox-hunting entity.         In an area 45 miles west of Washington, where generations-old farms are sometimes acquired by city-bred newcomers unaccustomed to seeing a horde of horsemen thunder across their front yards in pursuit of a pack of hounds in pursuit of a fox, no respecter of property lines, after all, it would be Mrs. Randolph's duty to pay the newcomers a call. Over a cup of tea, perhaps, she would acquaint them with the customs and traditions of the neighborhood, assuring them that the members of the Piedmont Hunt were always careful to close gates they might have opened and to not trample any flower beds near the house.         As a clincher, she would note that as landowners, the newcomers would be eligible to join the Piedmont, an act that would instantly elevate them to the upper reaches of Virginia society.         The widow of Dr. Archibald Cary Randolph, a landed surgeon whose family helped settle Virginia, Mrs. Randolph succeeded her husband as hunt master after his death in 1959. But she was something of a newcomer herself. In an area where the first families of Virginia can be downright condescending to those who trace their ancestry to only the second wave of settlers, Mrs. Randolph achieved social prominence and fox-hunting distinction despite the fact that she was an actual Yankee.         Mrs. Randolph was born Sept. 27, 1905, in Beverly Farms, Mass., and learned to ride at the age of 3. Her father was master of the local Myopia Hunt, and she was fox hunting long before she saw Virginia.         Even so, she readily acknowledged that she received some of her most vivid training in advanced fence-jumping during Virginia visits to her daredevil uncle, General George S. Patton.         Mrs. Randolph -- whose first marriage, to the Massachusetts-born New York investment banker Robert Winthrop, ended in divorce -- married well twice and was born better.         Her father, Charles Ayer, was a member of the family that settled Ayer, Mass., and made a considerable fortune dealing in woolens and patent medicines,  including the 19th-century tonic rage, sarsaparilla.         After her divorce, Mrs. Randolph, who had fallen in love with the Virginia hunt country during her years at Foxcroft, a Virginia boarding school, settled there and renewed her acquaintance with Dr. Randolph, whom she had known as the  dashing master of the Piedmont Hunt during her boarding school days.         After their marriage in 1941, she became active in every aspect of equestrian affairs, breeding show and steeplechase champions, leading a drive to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs and receiving numerous honors for her work, including an honorary degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.         But it was as a highly accomplished horsewoman, one who could take the lead in an organization that prides itself on being the nation's fastest hunt ("Keep  up or go home" is one of its official rules), that she won greatest acclaim.         It was a tribute to her standing, and her reputation for social observation,  that in her later years newcomers tended to come to her.         In an area of such sprawling acreage and long driveways that next-door neighbors tend to drive over when they visit, Mrs. Randolph lived next door to Paul Mellon, not that she could actually see the Pittsburgh banking heir's house from her own.         But she could see his private landing strip from her parlor window and took wry delight in the extravagant idiosyncrasies of the very wealthy. Whenever she  would see the Mellons's private plane land and then take off 10 minutes later, her step-granddaughter and farm manager, Becky Armstrong, recalled yesterday, Mrs. Randolph would take a sip of her tea and nod knowingly: It was only Mrs. Mellon, she would say, come home to fetch a scarf.         Mrs. Randolph is survived by three children from her first marriage, Theodora Hooton of Glen Head, N.Y., Amory Winthrop of Millbrook, N.Y., and Cornelia Bonnie of Prospect, Ky.; five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Ella Fitzgerald, whose sweet, silvery voice and endlessly inventive vocal improvisations made her the most celebrated jazz singer of her generation, died  yesterday at home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 79.         She had been suffering from diabetes and its eyesight and circulatory system  complications for many years. In 1993, both of her legs were amputated below the knees.         A pre-eminent American singer who brought a classic sense of musical proportion and balance to everything she touched, Miss Fitzgerald won the sobriquet "first lady of song" and earned the unqualified admiration of most of  her peers. Musicians from Bing Crosby to Benny Goodman, when asked to name their favorite singer, cited Ella Fitzgerald.         "Man, woman or child, Ella is the greatest," Crosby once said. Mel Torme hailed her as having "the best ear of any singer ever." Until the 1970's, when physical problems began to impinge on her perfect technique, this hefty, unglamorous woman seemed to loom as an immutable creative force in a musical world where everything else was crumbling.         In a career that spanned six decades, Miss Fitzgerald stood above the emotional fray of the scores of popular standards she performed. Stylistically she was the polar opposite of her equally legendary peer, Billie Holiday, who conveyed a wounded vulnerability. Even when handed a sad song, Miss Fitzgerald communicated a wistful, sweet-natured compassion for the heartache she described.         Where Holiday and Frank Sinatra lived out the dramas they sang about, Miss Fitzgerald, viewing them from afar, seemed to understand and forgive all. Her apparent equanimity and her clear pronunciation, which transcended race, ethnicity, class and age, made her a voice of profound reassurance and hope.         Over the decades, Miss Fitzgerald performed with big bands, symphony orchestras and small jazz groups. Her repertory encompassed show tunes, jazz songs, novelties (like her first major hit, "A-Tisket A-Tasket," recorded in 1938), bossa nova, and even opera ("Porgy and Bess" excerpts, recorded with Louis Armstrong). At her jazziest, her material became a springboard for ever-changing, ebullient vocal inventions, delivered in a sweet, girlish voice that could leap, slide or growl anywhere within a range of nearly three octaves.         Great Diction And Vocal Agility         Miss Fitzgerald was renowned both for her delicately rendered ballads and her pyrotechnical displays of scat improvisation. (The jazz historian Barry Ulanov traced the term be-bop to her spontaneous interpolation of the word "re-bop" in  her 1939 recording of "T'Ain't What You Do, It's the Way That You Do It.") She was sometimes criticized for a lack of bluesiness and emotional depth. But her perfect intonation, vocal acrobatics, clear diction and endless store of melodic improvisations -- all driven by powerful rhythmic undercurrents -- brought her nearly universal acclaim.         During her long career, Miss Fitzgerald recorded with Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Louis Armstrong. Her series of "Songbook" albums, celebrating such songwriters as Cole Porter, Harold Arlen, the Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart and Duke Ellington, helped to elevate the work of the best American songwriters to a stature widely recognized as art song.         "I never knew how good our songs were," Ira Gershwin once said, "until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them."         Although most biographies give her birth date as 1918, her birth certificate  and school records show her to have been born a year earlier, on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Va. She was the product of a common-law marriage between William Fitzgerald and Temperance Williams Fitzgerald. The couple separated within a year of her birth, and with her mother and a Portuguese immigrant named Joseph Da Silva, she moved to Yonkers.         As a child, Miss Fitzgerald dreamed of being a dancer. But she also sang and  was attracted to the recordings of Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and the Boswell  Sisters, in particular the group's lead singer, Connee Boswell.         "My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it," she  recalled many years later. "I tried so hard to sound just like her."         As a teen-ager, Miss Fitzgerald developed a dance routine with a friend, Charles Gulliver, which they performed in local clubs. Then in 1932, her mother  died suddenly, and she went to live with an aunt in Harlem.         On Nov. 21, 1934, she made her stage debut in an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater, singing two songs, "The Object of My Affection" and "Judy," in the style of Connee Boswell. She won first prize.         Around this time, she also caught the attention of Chick Webb, the band leader and drummer, who was reluctant to sign her to a contract because she was  gawky and unkempt, a "diamond in the rough," as the band leader Mario Bauza later remembered. But the audience's reaction to her performances persuaded him  to offer her a job, and during the Webb band's residency at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem her reputation blossomed.         "I thought my singing was pretty much hollering," she recalled many years later, "but Webb didn't."         A Novelty Song Made Her a Star         Miss Fitzgerald made her first recording in 1935 ("Love and Kisses," with Chick Webb), and had her first hit with "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," a song she helped  write, adapting the lyric, she later explained, from "that old drop-the-handkerchief game I played from 6 to 7 years old on up." The record became a popular sensation and made her a star. After Webb died in 1939, the young singer was the band's nominal leader until mid-1942, when it broke up. Between her recording debut in 1935 and the demise of the band seven years later, Miss Fitzgerald recorded almost 150 sides, the majority of them novelties and disposable pop fluff.         During this period, she married Benjamin Kornegay, a shipyard worker and petty thief with a criminal record. The marriage ended in annulment after two years. The singer was 30 when she fell in love with the bassist Ray Brown while  they were on tour with Dizzy Gillespie's band. They were married in December 1947, set up housekeeping in East Elmhurst, Queens, and adopted the son of Miss  Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances. They named the boy Ray Jr. While Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on her career, her son was cared for by her aunt Virginia.         The marriage eventually became a casualty of conflicting career schedules, and the couple were divorced in 1953, although they continued to work together.  In 1957, there were reports in the Scandinavian press that she had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a Norwegian impresario. Miss Fitzgerald is survived by Ray Brown Jr. and a grandchild.         As early as 1942 and 43, Miss Fitzgerald began to be influenced by the experiments of such be-bop instrumentalists as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. She incorporated elements of be-bop rhythm and harmony into her singing, and while on tour with the Gillespie band in 1946 she embraced the music wholeheartedly.         A year earlier, she had recorded what would become one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade, a version of "Flying Home" in which she indulged extensively in the phonetic improvisation known as scat. Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness.         Two years later, when Decca released her sensational be-bop version of "Lady  Be Good," Downbeat magazine proclaimed her "as great a master of bop as she has  been of swing."         These achievements were among the high points of a recording career that found Miss Fitzgerald recording in all manner of pop settings. Between 1935 and  1955 she recorded for Decca Records. Under the commercially astute supervision of the producer Milt Gabler, she was teamed with the vocal group the Ink Spots for several hits, including the million-selling "I'm Making Believe" and "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall." She also scored commercially with novelty duets  recorded with Louis Jordan, the most popular of which was "Stone Cold Dead in the Market."         A Huge Change Of Direction         Dictated largely by the fads of the moment, Miss Fitzgerald's pre-1955 pop recording career was an artistically mixed bag and stood distinct from her work  as a swing and jazz singer in nightclubs. One of the artistic high points of the Decca years was a 10-inch long-playing record, "Ella Sings Gershwin," which she  recorded with the pianist Ellis Larkins in 1950.         Miss Fitzgerald's life changed when Norman Granz, the impresario of the popular Jazz at the Philharmonic series, invited her to join the touring jam sessions in 1949 and later became her manager. One of her most popular numbers,  "How High the Moon," evolved into the unofficial signature tune of the series.         Their relationship quickly developed into one of the most productive artist-manager partnerships in the history of jazz. When Miss Fitzgerald's contract with Decca expired, she became the first artist Mr. Granz signed to his new Verve label. It was under his supervision that she undertook the series of landmark "Songbook" albums that brought her voice to a large nonjazz audience.         "I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop," she later recalled. "I thought be-bop was 'it,' and that all I had to do was go someplace  and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman came along, and he felt that I should do other things, so he produced 'The Cole Porter Songbook' with me. It was a turning point in my life."         "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook" became the prototype for a series of anthologies recorded over more than a decade and focusing on individual composers or composing teams, blending familiar standards and lesser-known, usually first-rate songs.         Backed by various studio orchestras, she also interpreted the work of Irving  Berlin, Harold Arlen, Duke Ellington, the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer  and Rodgers and Hart. "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook," a 53-song, 5-LP collection recorded with the arranger and conductor Nelson Riddle in 1959, is widely regarded as the greatest of the collections.         These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing  the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.         From 1956 through the mid-1960's, Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on material that was almost consistently commensurate with her artistry, and her career soared. She made her first feature-film appearance in "Pete Kelly's Blues," in 1955, and in 1957 presented her own concert at the Hollywood Bowl. In April 1958 she gave a Carnegie Hall concert with Duke Ellington to celebrate the release of her four-disk set, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook."         A workhorse who toured from 40 to 45 weeks of each year, Miss Fitzgerald showed the first signs of fatigue when she nearly collapsed on the stage during a concert in Munich in 1965. Five years earlier, Mr. Granz had sold Verve records to MGM, and when her contract came up for renewal in 1966, she was not re-signed to the label, but Mr. Granz moved her to Capitol, where her producer,  Dave Dexter, promised to give her "a totally different sound." These albums, which included a religious record, an album of country music and a Christmas collection, found her groping insecurely for a new pop identity.         Signed briefly to Reprise Records, Miss Fitzgerald tried singing contemporary hits by the Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Marvin Gaye, but rock and soul proved almost as uncongenial to her style as had country.         Basie, Sinatra And Symphonies         She returned to jazz full time when Mr. Granz founded his label Pablo in 1973. Among her many Pablo recordings are four duet albums with the guitarist Joe Pass, made from 1973 to 1986, and another songbook album devoted to the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. She also began performing regularly with symphony orchestras, and in 1974 she teamed with Frank Sinatra and Count Basie for a two-week concert engagement at the Uris Theater in New York that grossed more than a million dollars.         From the early 1970's, Miss Fitzgerald began to have eyesight problems complicated by diabetes, and in 1986 she had heart surgery, but she returned to  the concert stage the next year. Despite ill health, she continued to perform at least once month into the early 1990's. Although her quality of voice slowly deteriorated from the early 1970's, even at the end of her career, her singing retained a remarkable rhythmic acuity.         Offstage, Miss Fitzgerald lived a quiet, self-protective life in a 13-room house in Beverly Hills. Her social life involved a small circle of old friends,  including members of the Count Basie and Duke Ellington orchestras, and other singers, including over the years Carmen McRae, Sarah Vaughan and Peggy Lee.         A model of abstemious self-discipline, she shunned cigarettes and liquor. She was also a person of few words. Shy and extremely sensitive to criticism, she preferred to let Mr. Granz do most of the talking for her.         Asked once how she felt about being "a legend," she replied: "I don't think I noticed it at first. But when Norman Granz and I began recording the 'Songbook'  series in the mid-50's, it just seemed that more people began to like my singing. The awards I started winning didn't make me feel important, but they made me realize people loved me. And then kids started calling me 'Ella' -- half of them never even mentioned 'Ella Fitzgerald' -- just 'Ella.' "         She amassed countless awards and commendations, including honorary doctorates at Yale and Dartmouth, the National Medal of Arts, and 13 Grammy Awards, including one in 1967 for Lifetime Achievement. In 1979 she was given a Kennedy  Center Award for her lifetime in the performing arts.         Accepting an honorary doctorate of music at Yale, she commented with her characteristic modesty, "Not bad for someone who only studied music to get that  half-credit in high school."         Fitzgerald for Home Listening         Ella Fitzgerald was one of the most prolific recording artists in jazz. These are some of her best albums:         "Ella Fitzgerald: 75th-Birthday Celebration" (Decca Jazz). A two-disk, 39-song collection, it includes the cream of the singer's pop output recorded for Decca between 1938 and 1955.         "Pure Ella" (Decca Jazz). These 20 songs recorded in the 1950's with the pianist Ellis Larkins exemplify elegant simplicity and ideal teamwork.         "Ella and Louis" (Verve). In this 1956 collaboration with Louis Armstrong, two titans meet playfully.         "Like Someone in Love" (Verve). This lush collection of 19 ballads recorded in 1957 with Frank DeVol's orchestra is her most romantic album.         "Mack the Knife: The Complete Ella in Berlin" (Verve). This classic live album was recorded in 1960 when the singer was at the height of her powers.         "The Intimate Ella" (Verve). Originally released in 1960 under the title "Ella Fitzgerald Sings Songs From the Soundtrack of 'Let No Man Write My Epitaph,' " the collection of 13 ballads recorded with the pianist Paul Smith is a neglected masterpiece.         "The Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks" (Verve). Taken together, these 16 disks, recorded between 1956 and 1964, constitute the singer's crowning achievement. The tributes to Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer can also be purchased individually. Although the Cole Porter collection,  which was the first, is the most famous, it is not the best. The 53-song Gershwin album, recorded with Nelson Riddle's orchestra, is the artistic peak.         "Ella and Basie: On the Sunny Side of the Street" (Verve). A swinging powerhouse, released in 1963.         "Fitzgerald and Pass . . . Again" (Pablo). The best joint recording by two beautifully matched jazz classicists.         "Fine and Mellow" (Pablo). A wonderful swinging album from 1974, recorded with an all-star small ensemble.         Correction:  June 20, 1996, Thursday         An obituary on Sunday about Ella Fitzgerald misidentified the first feature film in which she appeared. It was "Ride 'Em Cowboy" in 1942, not "Pete Kelly's  Blues" in 1955.       
         Kathy Ahern, a former child prodigy of a golfer who turned professional while still a teen-ager, died on Saturday at her home in Phoenix. She was 47.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, family members said.         Ms. Ahern won three tournaments during her career on the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour, including the 1972 L.P.G.A. Championship, one of the tour's four major championships. She also won the 1970 Southgate Open and the 1972 George Washington Classic.         An accomplished amateur who won the 1964 Texas Public Links Championship at the age of 15, Ms. Ahern was just 17 years old when she joined the L.P.G.A. Tour after her senior year in high school in 1967. As a senior in Dallas, she also won the Texas Amateur and the Texas Junior and was runner-up in the United States Golf Association Junior Amateur.         Before a series of injuries interrupted her playing career in the late 1970's, Ms. Ahern was regularly a factor on the tour. A good ball striker with an excellent short game, she was the runner-up in the 1971 L.P.G.A. Championship, and then won the tournament the next year at Pleasant Valley Country Club.         Although she competed rarely throughout the 1980's, Ms. Ahern remained in touch with the L.P.G.A., sometimes assisting and coaching players, or caddying on tour for her close friend, Sherri Turner.         In May of 1991, it was diagnosed that Ms. Ahern had breast cancer. She underwent a lumpectomy and a series of radiation treatments. The cancer metastasized in 1993, but Ms. Ahern remained an active supporter of the L.P.G.A., attending a tournament as recently as the first week in June.         "Kathy's courage and determination in the face of her illness is an inspiration to us all," L.P.G.A. Commissioner Jim Ritts said. "She was never deterred from showing her love of the L.P.G.A., her family and friends while she was making a lasting impact on the lives of many."         She is survived by her mother, Kay Ahern, and several sisters.       
         Justice Birdie Amsterdam, who achieved several judicial firsts, including being the first woman elected to the New York State Supreme Court, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived on the Lower East Side, just steps from where she was born.         Justice Amsterdam came to be called the "first lady of the judiciary" by her  peers and other admirers, a sobriquet earned during 35 years on the bench.         She was the first woman elected to the Municipal Court in New York County in 1940. She was active in the Democratic Party, but when she was up for re-election in 1949, she carried the endorsements of all three parties, all bar  associations, the Citizens' Union and the American Federation of Labor.         In 1954, she was appointed Acting Justice of the City Court, another first for a woman, and won election to the office the next year.         In 1958, she gained the Supreme Court bench as a Democrat-Liberal, supported  again by a long roster of civic, communal, educational, labor, scientific, philanthropic and religious groups. She served until 1975.         Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, the first woman on the Court of Appeals in Albany, the state's highest tribunal, recalled Justice Amsterdam's trailblazing  achievements in a 1991 article in the New York Law Journal.         The State Supreme Court was more than 250 years old before a woman was elected to it, Judge Kaye wrote, and even today women do not enjoy the status of equals in the legal profession. "Thoughts of Justice Amsterdam's arrival on the  New York State Supreme Court serve to remind of us both of how far we have advanced toward these objectives and how much they continue to elude us," she wrote.         Justice Amsterdam was one of six children of Joseph Amsterdam, a band leader  from Austria. At 12, she taught English to foreign-born neighbors. Growing up in a neighborhood of immigrants and the poor awakened a commitment to social issues that guided her life as a lawyer. Her concerns ranged from playgrounds to summer camps, from slum clearance to shelter for the aged and the infirm, and from medical care to tuition assistance that could give a student a leg up. One of her special interests was the advancement of women in the legal profession.         She graduated on a state scholarship from Hunter College High School at 17. Waiting to meet the age requirement for admission to New York University Law School, she spent a year studying economics, banking and accounting at City College. She took evening classes at N.Y.U. and held a full-time job at Mount Sinai Hospital, keeping records and accounts.         Once she received her law degree in 1922, Mount Sinai doctors helped her practice by steering friends her way. She swiftly established a reputation not only as a skillful lawyer but also as an eloquent friend of the downtrodden, a champion of women's rights and a diligent party worker. She became a Tammany Hall district co-leader on the East Side.         Justice Amsterdam was honored by scores of organizations. "Who's Who of American Women" named her outstanding woman of the year for 1960 in the legal field, citing her "pre-eminent attainments and the inspiration they offer to other women in your profession."         Justice Amsterdam is survived by a sister and brother-in-law, Cynthia and Judge Milton Sanders, with whom she shared a home on Second Avenue for 59 years, as well as another sister, Sybil Chizner of Hollywood, Fla.         Correction:  July 11, 1996, Thursday         An obituary yesterday of Justice Birdie Amsterdam, the first woman elected to New York State Supreme Court, misstated the given name of a surviving sister. She is Ruth Sanders, not Cynthia.       
         Peg Weiss, an art historian, research professor and leading scholar on the Russian modernist Wassily Kandinsky, died on Wednesday at her home in Syracuse.  She was 63.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Volker Weiss, said.         In 1982, Mrs. Weiss was the curator of "Kandinsky in Munich" at the Solomon  R. Guggenheim Museum. She also wrote three books on the artist: "Kandinsky and Old Russia: The Artist as Ethnographer and Shaman," (Yale University Press, 1995); "Kandinsky in Munich, 1896-1914," the catalogue for the Guggenheim exhibition, and "Kandinsky in Munich: The Formative Jugendstil Years," (Princeton University Press, 1979).         Besides being a research professor at Syracuse University, Mrs.  Weiss was also a Getty scholar from 1989 to 1990. Before that she was the chief curator of the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, from 1979 to 1980, and the curator of collections there from 1975 until 1979.         Mrs. Weiss was born in Denver and reared in Massachusetts. In 1950, she moved to Syracuse to study art history, earning her B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Syracuse University. In 1956 she won a scholarship to study art history in Munich, and it was there that she became interested in Kandinsky's life and work.         She taught courses on modern art at colleges and universities across the country, including Cornell University and Columbia University. She was a guest curator at the Guggenheim Museum from 1979 until 1982.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Weiss is survived by two sons, Erick, of Los Angeles and Christopher, of Syracuse.       
         Jessica Mitford, whose book "The American Way of Death" won her enormous popularity as an irreverent muckraker and witty polemicist, died yesterday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Constancia Romilly.         Over the more than three decades that she wrote nonfiction, Miss Mitford railed against those who tried to suppress dissent over the Vietnam War, against a prison system she found to be corrupt and brutalizing, and against a medical profession she thought was greedy and given to unnecessary procedures. She even  exposed the odd doings of her sisters.         But it was "The American Way of Death," published in 1963, that made the British-born Miss Mitford a formidable literary figure in her adopted country. Near her death she was preparing a revision to be published next year by Alfred  A. Knopf.         The thesis of the book, a scathing indictment of the American funeral industry, was that undertakers had "successfully turned the tables in recent years to perpetrate a huge, macabre and expensive practical joke on the American public."         She explored the changing lexicon of death, in which undertakers had come to  call themselves "funeral directors" and "morticians," coffins had become "caskets," and hearses had become "professional cars." In the new order, she said, flowers were "floral tributes" and corpses were always called "loved ones." One of the results of all this, she said, was that the cost of dying was  rising faster than was the cost of living.         She told her readers unsettling things about their neighborhood undertakers,  much to the dismay of the trade, and at the end of the book included a list of medical schools that might have good use for a dead body. She felt strongly that someone's mortal remains would be better off studied by medical students than transformed into a profit center for those in the business of marketing and planning funerals.         The New Yorker hailed the book as a "brilliant journalistic case against the  whole funeral industry," and the work led to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. But not everyone was pleased. James B. Utt, then a Republican  Congressman from California, a state known for its Pharaonic funerals and ornate cemeteries, denounced Miss Mitford as "pro-Communist, anti-American." Mr. Utt said he suspected that profits from the book "no doubt will find their way into  the coffers of the Communist Party, U.S.A." Miss Mitford had been a Communist in the 1940's, an experience chronicled in her memoirs, but had quit the party.         Jessica Mitford was born on Sept. 11, 1917, at Batsford Mansion in Gloucestershire, England, one of seven children and the youngest daughter born to Lord Redesdale (David Mitford) and Lady Redesdale, the former Sydney Bowles.         It was by any measure a family given to eccentricity. One of Miss Mitford's five sisters, Pamela, aspired as a child to be a horse. Another, Diana, wanted to be a Fascist and succeeded in becoming the wife of Sir Oswald Mosley, the ranking leader of Britain's Fascists. Another daughter, Unity, went to Germany,  became a disciple of Hitler, shot herself and died nine years later in a nursing home.         Miss Mitford's eldest sister, Nancy, became a novelist, and is best remembered for "The Pursuit of Love" and "Love in a Cold Climate."         Miss Mitford described her childhood as largely unhappy. She particularly resented that she and her sisters were prevented from going to school because Lady Redesdale did not believe that girls needed it and tutored them at home.         Early in life, Miss Mitford shared a sitting room with her sister Unity, who  adorned it with swastikas. According to her memoirs, Miss Mitford responded by using a diamond ring to carve small hammers and sickles into the windowpanes on her side of the room.         When she was 19, she ran away from home with a second cousin, Esmond Romilly, a nephew of Winston Churchill. Because she eloped, she was cut out of her father's will. In 1939, Miss Mitford quit her job as a market researcher in the  London office of J. Walter Thompson and moved to the United States with her husband. He joined the Canadian Air Force after the war broke out and was killed in action in 1941.         Miss Mitford was a union organizer, a bartender at a Miami restaurant, a clerk in a Washington dress shop and a typist and later an investigator at the Office of Price Administration in World War II.         In 1943, she married Robert E. Treuhaft, a lawyer from Brooklyn, and the couple moved to Oakland, Calif. When Miss Mitford was 38, she decided that she would become a writer. She had largely failed at her other jobs, she wrote, and  "I figured that the only thing that requires no education and no skills is writing."         She produced her first book, "Life itselfmanship," in 1956. It was privately  published and had little circulation. Her second effort, "Daughters and Rebels," an autobiography, was published in 1960 and won praise from the critics. Her next book was "The American Way of Death," which remained on the best-seller list for a year.         Late in life, she was asked what sort of funeral she wanted. An elaborate one, she replied, with "six black horses with plumes and one of those marvelous  jobs of embalming that take 20 years off." She added that she wanted "streets to be blocked off, dignitaries to declaim sobbingly over the flower-smothered bier, proclamations to be issued -- that sort of thing."         Her other books attracted much attention, although none as much as "The American Way of Death." She also wrote "The Trial of Dr. Spock, William Sloan Coffin Jr., Michael Ferber, Mitchell Goodman and Marcus Raskin" (1969), five who were accused of aiding and abetting those who sought to violate the Selective Service Act. Among her other books were "Kind and Unusual Punishment: The Prison Business" (1973), a study of American prisons, which she found wanting in almost everything except brutality; "A Fine Old Conflict" (1977), a memoir of her Communist days; "Poison Penmanship: The Gentle Art of Muckraking" (1979), and "The American Way of Birth" (1992), in which she accused doctors of doing too many Caesarean sections and of not paying enough attention to the possibilities  offered by midwifery.         She also wrote articles for Life, Esquire, The Nation and The San Francisco Chronicle.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband; a  son, Benjamin Treuhaft of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Deborah Devonshire of Chatsworth, England, and Diana Mosley of Paris, and three grandchildren.         Correction:         An obituary of the writer Jessica Mitford on Wednesday omitted the titles of  her surviving sisters and misidentified the hometown of one. One sister is Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire. Her hometown is Bakewell, in Darbyshire; Chatsworth is the name of her house. The other sister is Lady Diana Mosley.         An obituary on July 24 about the writer Jessica Mitford misstated the relative ages of her and her sisters. Ms. Mitford was the second youngest of six daughters. Her sister Deborah was the youngest.       
         Claudette Colbert, the versatile stage and film star whose flair for light comedy cheered audiences during the Depression and for decades afterward, died yesterday at Belle-rive, her home on the island of Barbados. She was 92 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Miss Colbert's wit, gaiety, cupid's-bow mouth and light touch took her from the Art Students League in New York to the height of stardom on Broadway and in  Hollywood. She is best remembered for screwball comedies in which, no matter what situation befell her, she usually managed to keep her aplomb and good humor. Her greatest triumph was playing a runaway heiress opposite Clark Gable's cynical reporter in Frank Capra's film comedy "It Happened One Night," a performance that won her an Academy Award as best actress in 1934.         She could appear worldly and sophisticated yet down to earth, a quality that, combined with attention to camera angles, lighting and other technical details, helped her to sustain a remarkably durable career encompassing more than 60 films and many stage appearances.         In 1981, in her seventh decade in show business, the New York Times critic Frank Rich, praising her performance in the Broadway flop "A Talent for Murder," called her "a lady of piquant, irrepressible, ever-so-amusing common sense." He  cited "her big Betty Boop eyes, curly light hair" and "her low, one-of-the-boys  voice, effortlessly hurling asides like pool balls into every pocket of the house."         "Audiences always sound like they're glad to see me, and I'm damned glad to see them," Miss Colbert told an interviewer in 1978. "If they want you, you want to do it. The feeling never dies."         From 'The Lady Lies' To the Milk of Asses         Miss Colbert had her first film success in 1929, as the heroine of the talkie "The Lady Lies." Her early notable films, all box-office hits, included "The Smiling Lieutenant" (1931), a wistful Ernst Lubitsch comedy; "The Sign of the Cross," a 1932 Cecil B. DeMille spectacular in which she played Nero's sensuous  empress Poppaea, and the 1934 production of "Cleopatra," in which she played the title role.         "The Sign of the Cross" included a memorable scene with Miss Colbert bathing  in what was described by the studio as asses' milk, a scene that became widely admired. The film historian David Thomson wrote six decades later that Miss Colbert had bathed not only in asses' milk but also in "the director's boyish lasciviousness."         Miss Colbert confided in a 1984 interview that the asses' milk was really made from a powdered product called Klim.         "That's 'milk' spelled backward," the star explained. "I was in the pool all  day. The Klim was so warm my bangs came uncurled. When the electricians turned off all the hot lights for an hour it congealed and the Klim turned to cream cheese."         Besides DeMille, directors of her films included George Cukor, John Ford, Gregory LaCava, Mervyn LeRoy and Anatole Litvak. Among her leading men were Maurice Chevalier, Gary Cooper, Joseph Cotten, Melvyn Douglas, Henry Fonda, Fred MacMurray, Fredric March, Ray Milland, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne and Orson Welles.         Her early films were followed by such successes as "Imitation of Life" (1934); "The Gilded Lily" (1935); "Private Worlds" (1935), a drama of a mental institution; "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife" (1938), another Lubitsch comedy; "Midnight" (1939); "The Palm Beach Story" (1942), a Preston Sturges caper, and "Since You Went Away" (1944), a drama of the American home front during World War II.         Her last artistically substantial movie role was as a married American woman  in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in "Three Came Home" (1950). Her performance  was warmly praised by the critics, but the film did not fare well at the box office.         Through much of her movie career she was under contract to Paramount, although she was on loan to Columbia when she made "It Happened One Night." After 1950 her movie roles were largely vignettes. She made her last feature film, "Parrish," in 1961 but went before the cameras again in 1986 for a television movie, "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles."         Miss Colbert's most noteworthy stage vehicles included "The Barker" (1927), a box-office hit in which she played an alluring snake charmer; Eugene O'Neill's "Dynamo," which was produced by the Theater Guild in 1929 and won her considerable prestige, although it was not a popular success, and the fluffy comedy "The Marriage-Go-Round," a smash hit that opened in 1958 co-starring Charles Boyer, with whom she had also appeared in such films as "Private Worlds" (1935) and "Tovarich" (1937).         An important ingredient in her early success in the theater was her skill asa speaker. When talking films took hold and many silent-film stars turned out to have inadequate voices, she was taken on by Paramount.         "Hollywood was not my dream, you know," she said in an interview in 1978. "I  only left Broadway when the crash came. The Depression killed the theater, and the pictures were manna from heaven."         For many years, Miss Colbert was among the top-earning movie stars: some industry analysts calculated that she was the industry's best-paid star in 1938  and 1942. That made it even easier for her to clothe her 5-foot-4-inch frame ultra-fashionably, and for several years she was voted Hollywood's best-dressed  woman.         Despite her long identification with Hollywood, Miss Colbert's dramatic skills were versatile enough that she was among the few major film stars who managed repeatedly to return to the stage to critical acclaim.         Triumphant Returns To the Theater         Her first return to Broadway, after more than a quarter-century and the cooling of her movie career, came in the spring of 1956, when she replaced Margaret Sullavan during the spring and summer in the comedy "Janus." Appearances in other Broadway productions followed, including "The Marriage-Go-Round," and in 1963 she announced that she was bidding farewell to Hollywood for good.         Miss Colbert was born in Paris on Sept. 13, 1903, and was brought to this country as a child by her parents, Georges and Jeanne Loew Chauchoin. Her name was originally Lily Claudette Chauchoin. But she took the name Claudette Colbert (pronounced coal-BEAR) for her first Broadway role, an opening that resulted from an introduction to the playwright Anne Morrison at a tea party in New York  in 1923. Miss Colbert, who was studying at the Art Students League, jokingly suggested that Morrison give her a role in her next play. Morrison gave her a small one in "The Wild Westcotts."         "I just went right onstage, and I learned by watching," Miss Colbert said years later, noting that she had never taken acting lessons. "I've always believed that acting is instinct to start with; you either have it or you don't."         Broadway fame came quickly. In 1927 the young Leland Hayward, who would become a celebrated theatrical producer, told the director Frank Capra that Miss Colbert was "a real headline maker, the finest young actress that's hit Broadway in years."         Mr. Capra was soon directing the silent movie "For the Love of Mike," with Mr. Hayward in overall charge of production and Miss Colbert in the leading female role.         The movie, nade on a shoestring, was a flop. In his 1971 book "The Name Above the Title," Mr. Capra wrote that Miss Colbert, "never easily pleased, said that  for her it was a disaster, and vowed that it would be her first and last film."         Although she changed her mind, Miss Colbert was far from Mr. Capra's first choice for the female lead when he began preparing "It Happened One Night." First he approached Myrna Loy, who turned the part down. So did Margaret Sullavan. So did Miriam Hopkins. So did Constance Bennett.         Finally Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Pictures, suggested Miss Colbert, who grudgingly took on the role. When the movie was being made, Mr. Capra reported, Miss Colbert proved to be firm yet engaging. For one intimate scene, he said: "Claudette refused to even partially undress before the camera. She wanted to feature her acting, not her sex appeal."         By the same token, she refused at first to raise her skirt for the subsequently famous hitchhiking scene, in which the script called for her to demonstrate that a display of leg could stop a motorist.         And so, Mr. Capra recalled: "We waited until the casting director sent us a chorus girl with shapely underpinnings to 'double' for Colbert's. When she saw the double's leg, she said: 'Get her out of here. I'll do it. That's not my leg!' "         During the filming, Mr. Capra asserted, Miss Colbert had "many little tantrums, motivated by her antipathy toward me," but "she was wonderful in the part." Later it was said that she told friends, "I've just finished the worst picture in the world."         When Oscar time rolled around, the film won the five top awards: best picture, best writer, best director, best actor and best actress.         When the Oscar was placed in her hands Miss Colbert said, "I owe Frank Capra  for this."         In later years Miss Colbert also appeared frequently on television, and in that medium, too, it was said that despite her talent she could be difficult. Noel Coward, who worked with her in 1956 on the live telecast of his comedy "Blithe Spirit," recorded in his diary that he found her "extremely tiresome."         "All this is a sad pity," he wrote, "because she is, within her limits, an excellent actress and those limits she imposes on herself.I have for years had a definite affection for her as a person, but these rehearsals are wilting it considerably."         Miss Colbert, who was short-necked, liked to tell of a Coward comment during  those rehearsals: "If she had a neck, I'd wring it." Miss Colbert said the comment had hurt at the time, but agreed that it was funny. She and Coward made  up a year later.         Miss Colbert drew praise for her acting, into her 80's. She co-starred on Broadway with Rex Harrison in "The Kingfisher" in 1981 and shared top billing with him again in the 1985 Broadway revival of "Aren't We All?," a 1923 drawing-room comedy by Frederick Lonsdale that took them to Australia for a five-month tour after runs in London, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Mr. Rich of The Times called her the play's "most alluring attraction" and "simply a wonder" as the tea-sipping Lady Frinton.         Always Appreciative Of Her Film Genre         In 1984, a building at the Kaufman Astoria studios in Queens, where she made  her first 10 films for Paramount, was named after her, and the Film Society of Lincoln Center paid tribute to her lifetime achievement with a gala in her honor. She was also honored by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1989.         For years, Miss Colbert spent six months annually at her beachfront estate in Barbados, where her guests included Ingrid Bergman, Frank Sinatra and Ronald and Nancy Reagan. She remained on Barbados after her stroke three years ago.         In 1928, Miss Colbert married Norman Foster, an actor and director who was appearing with her in "The Barker." They were divorced in 1935, and in December  of that year she married Dr. Joel Pressman; he died in 1968, and she leaves no immediate family members.         Miss Colbert never looked down on the material she was best at. The film studios liked her to do comedy, she once said, "because they made a lot of money off me." But she added: "I did the comedy because all my life I always wanted to laugh myself. There was never anything that gave me as much satisfaction as to be in something amusing."         Emancipated, With a Light Touch         During a career that began in the 1920's and lasted into the 1980's, Claudette Colbert starred in more than 60 films and in plays on Broadway and in  London. These are some of the works in which she appeared.

         Judge Genevieve Blatt, the first woman to be elected to statewide office in Pennsylvania and to serve on the state's appellate court, died on Thursday at a  retirement home in Hampden Township, Pa. She was 83 and a former resident of Harrisburg.         She spent more than 50 years in public service, starting as secretary and chief examiner of the Pittsburgh Civil Service Commission in 1938.         She became a force in Pennsylvania's Democratic Party as a member of the Democratic National Committee and the party's National Policy Committee. She attended every Democratic National Convention from 1932 to 1972 and served as vice chairwoman of the Pennsylvania delegation at the 1956 convention. She was the secretary of the State Democratic Committee from 1948 to 1971.         She was an assistant city solicitor in Pittsburgh in the 1940's. In 1954 she  was elected Secretary of Internal Affairs, a statewide office. She was re-elected in 1958 and 1962 but lost her bid for a fourth term in 1966.         She won a tight race in a party primary to run for the United States Senate in 1964 but then lost the election by 50,000 votes to the Republican incumbent,  Senator Hugh Scott.         In 1972, Gov. Milton J. Shapp appointed her to fill an unexpired term on the  Commonwealth Court, the state's appeals court. She won election on her own the next year, was re-elected in 1983, became a senior judge a year later and retired from the bench in 1993.         For her charitable, cultural and social work for the Roman Catholic Church, she received three papal honors, including the Lady Grand Cross in the Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulcher of Jerusalem.         Genevieve Blatt was born in East Brady, Clarion County. Majoring in economics, she received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Pittsburgh before graduating from its law school.         She is survived by two sisters, Sister Mary Frederick of Greensburg, Pa., and Bernadette B. McCloskey of Los Angeles, and a brother, Joseph A. Blatt of Pittsburgh.       
         Barbara Srenco Brier, a former world bridge champion, died yesterday in Allegheny University Hospitals Center City in Philadelphia. She was 73 and a resident of Miami.         Her daughter, Bonnie Brier of Penn Valley, Pa., said she died of complications after heart surgery.         In 1970 Mrs. Brier won the World Mixed Pairs Championship in Stockholm. Her partner was Waldemar Von Zedtwitz. This was a remarkable accomplishment, as he was 74 years old and had vision problems that made it difficult for him to see the cards. He died in 1984.         She won two national titles, the Open Pairs in 1955 and Mixed Teams in 1965, and was runner-up three times. She won many regional titles.         She was born in Philadelphia and graduated from Cornell University. She worked for many years as a bridge teacher, primarily in Miami.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Jean Hershell of Tinton Falls, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Louise Talma, a composer whose music combined a Neo-Classical spareness, clarity and lyricism with the structural rigorousness of the 12-tone school, died on Tuesday at Yaddo, the artists' colony near Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where she was composing a song cycle with chamber accompaniment. She was 89 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Talma's opera, ''The Alcestiad,'' a collaboration with Thornton Wilder, became the first work by an American woman to be presented by a major European opera company when it had its premiere at the Frankfurt Opera in 1962. In 1974, she became the first female composer to be elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.         A prolific composer who was especially adept at text setting, Ms. Talma wrote dozens of song cycles and choral works on both sacred and secular subjects. She also created a catalogue of colorfully scored chamber works and piano pieces, several of which have been recorded, most notably on a 1987 collection of her works on the CRI label, and on an earlier recording made by the Musical Heritage Society. These include ''Four-Handed Fun'' (1939), a light-spirited piano duet, as well as a set of sharp-edged bagatelles (1955) and the hauntingly beautiful ''Ambient Air'' (1983), a set of vivid evocations of nature for flute, violin, cello and piano.         Louise Juliette Talma was born in Arcachon, France, on Oct. 31, 1906, to American parents who were both professional musicians. She grew up in New York City, and studied chemistry at Columbia University while at the same time studying the piano and composition at the Institute of Musical Art, the predecessor of the Juilliard School. She also earned a music degree at New York University and a master of arts degree at Columbia.         As a student, she won prizes both as a pianist and for her compositions, and her ambition at first was to be a pianist. Between 1926 and 1935, she spent her summers studying with Isidore Philipp in France. In 1928, however, she began studying composition with Nadia Boulanger in Fontainebleau, and by 1935, Boulanger persuaded her to devote herself fully to composition. She continued her formal studies with Boulanger until 1939, and later became the first American to teach at Fontainebleau.         Boulanger's influence can be seen in the carefully etched Neo-Classicism of Ms. Talma's earliest works. In the early 1950's, she began using 12-tone techniques, principally as a way of creating themes rather than as an escape from conventional tonality. Yet lyricism and a sense of a tonal center remained crucial elements of her work, as did an approach to instrumental coloration that alluded to the styles of Ravel and Messiaen and often seemed to have more in common with the French style than with contemporary American works.         Ms. Talma taught at the Manhattan School of Music in the late 1920's, and at Hunter College for more than 50 years. She wrote ''Harmony for the College Student'' and was the co-author, with Robert Levin and James S. Harris, of ''Functional Harmony.'' She was a board member of the League of Composers, the International Society for Contemporary Music, the Fontainebleau Arts Association and the American Music Center.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Bibi Besch, an actress who appeared on many of television's most popular shows and was on the board of the Screen Actors Guild, died last Saturday at the Daniel Freeman Hospital in Los Angeles. Ms. Besch, who lived in Los Angeles, was 54.         She died of cancer, said her sister-in-law, Jenny Besch of Manhattan.         Ms. Besch, a daughter of the actress Gusti Huber and the mother of the actress Samantha Mathis, appeared on such television series as ''Northern Exposure,'' ''E.R.,'' ''L.A. Law,'' ''Law and Order,'' ''Night Court,'' Family Ties,'' ''Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' ''Coach,'' ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Her performances in ''Doing Time on Maple Drive'' and on ''Northern Exposure'' won her Emmy nominations in 1992 and 1993.         Ms. Besch's film credits included ''Steel Magnolias,'' ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,'' ''Tremors,'' ''Betsy's Wedding,'' ''Who's That Girl'' and ''The Promise.'' A director of the Screen Actors Guild from 1990 until her death, Ms. Besch served on many of the organization's committees, among them the national communications committee, the women's committee, the agents relations committee and the women's health task force.         Ms. Besch was born in Vienna, came to the United States as a child and grew up in the Westchester County towns of Mount Kisco and Chappaqua.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Besch is survived by her brother, Andrew Besch of Manhattan; two sisters, Drea Gillogly of Los Angeles and Christina MacDonald of Monceaux, France, and her stepfather, Joseph Besch of Manhattan.       
         Juliet Prowse, the tall, leggy dancer with the sultry smile and the bee-sting lips who became a tabloid celebrity when she offended Khrushchev and captivated Frank Sinatra, died yesterday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 59 and had been a staple of Las Vegas nightclub acts, television specials and touring musicals for more than 30 years.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, a spokesman said.         Although Miss Prowse was an accomplished dancer who had been trained in classical ballet in London and South Africa and had had a successful career in Europe before being discovered in Italy by the choreographer Hermes Pan, Miss Prowse was an unknown in the United States when Mr. Pan recruited her to appear with Mr. Sinatra and Shirley Maclaine in the movie-musical ''Can-Can.''         Then came the day in 1959 when Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, visited the ''Can-Can'' set in Hollywood during a celebrated state visit to the United States and pronounced the entertainment ''immoral.''         Within hours Miss Prowse's scantily-clad image was in virtually every newspaper in America and she was being hailed by Hollywood as another Betty Grable.         Miss Prowse, who knew propaganda when she heard it translated (Khrushchev had been all smiles during the visit, she said), was nonplused. ''Let's face it,'' she said. ''the cancan is a pretty raucous number. It's not exactly 'Swan Lake.' ''         Although she won enthusiastic praise for both her acting and her dancing in ''Can-Can,'' Miss Prowse was two decades late for the era of the big Hollywood musical and she appeared in only a few, largely forgettable movies, among them, ''The Second Time Around,'' with Debbie Reynolds; ''Who Killed Teddy Bear?'' with Sal Mineo, and ''G.I. Blues,'' with Elvis Presley.         But the Khrushchev remark, a romance with Mr. Sinatra (they were engaged for six weeks in 1962) and a simultaneous fling with Mr. Presley made her an enduring darling of the gossip columns and enhanced her popularity as a television and night club performer.         Juliet Prowse, whose father was a British manager for Westinghouse who died when she was 3, was born in Bombay, India, and grew up in South Africa, where she emerged as such a skilled dancer that at 14 she was the ''baby ballerina'' star of the Festival Ballet in Johannesburg.         At 17 she was pursuing her career in London, but had to switch to modern dance when she grew too tall, 5-7, for her partners. ''When I got on my toes,'' she said, ''some of those male partners were way down there.''         A part in the London production of ''Kismet'' led to an engagement at a celebrated topless dance club in Paris, but Miss Prowse was not allowed to appear uncovered.         ''I was considered English,'' she later said. ''In those shows, nudity was the guarded right of the French and German girls.''         She later appeared in Madrid, helped form what amounted to a traveling review and was dancing in Rome when she was spotted by Mr. Pan, Fred Astaire's longtime collaborator, who was so impressed by her grace and skill that he told friends she was the best feminine dancer he had ever seen.         Miss Prowse never became a major movie star, but in the years after ''Can-Can,'' she was rarely out of work partly because, for all her gossip column celebrity, she was a hard-working, disciplined professional whose performances were almost always well received.         She made a virtual career touring in ''Mame' and won such acclaim for her Las Vegas performance in ''Sweet Charity,'' in 1966, that the show was taken to London, where Miss Prowse won the British equivalent of a Tony Award.         After she broke off her engagement with Mr. Sinatra, Miss Prowse settled down to a series of long-term relationships but generally avoided matrimony. There was a brief early marriage she never talked about, and in 1980, just after giving birth to their son, she married John McCook, an actor. They were later divorced.         To those who worked with her, Miss Prowse's most striking feature was neither her long, shapely legs nor her dancing skills, but her sunny disposition and her perpetual good cheer even in the face of one disaster or another, like the time in 1987 when she was mauled by a leopard while rehearsing for a television special called ''Circus of the Stars.''         As her longtime manager, Mark Mordoh, noted yesterday, none of her friends were surprised that Miss Prowse was convinced that the same dedication and hard work that had brought her a successful show business career would lead to a victory over her cancer, discovered in 1994.         ''Even while she was getting chemotherapy,'' Mr. Mordoh said, ''she was teaching yoga classes.''         Miss Prowse is survived by her son, Seth McCook, of Los Angeles; her mother, Phylis Polte; a brother, Dr. Clive Prowse, both of Vanderbijl Park, South Africa, and her companion, B. J. Allen.

Juliet Prowse, whose father was a British manager for Westinghouse who died when she was 3, was born in Bombay, India, and grew up in South Africa, where she emerged as such a skilled dancer that at 14 she was the ''baby ballerina'' star of the Festival Ballet in Johannesburg.         At 17 she was pursuing her career in London, but had to switch to modern dance when she grew too tall, 5 feet, 7 inches, for her partners. ''When I got on my toes,'' she said, ''some of those male partners were way down there.''         A part in the London production of ''Kismet'' led to an engagement at a celebrated topless dance club in Paris, but Miss Prowse was not allowed to appear uncovered.         ''I was considered English,'' she later said. ''In those shows, nudity was the guarded right of the French and German girls.''         She later appeared in Madrid, helped form what amounted to a traveling review and was dancing in Rome when she was spotted by Mr. Pan, Fred Astaire's longtime collaborator, who told friends she was the best feminine dancer he had ever seen.         Miss Prowse never became a major movie star, but in the years after ''Can-Can'' she was rarely out of work partly because, for all her gossip- column celebrity, she was a hard-working, disciplined professional whose performances were almost always well received.         She made a virtual career touring in ''Mame' and won such acclaim for her Las Vegas performance in ''Sweet Charity,'' in 1966, that the show was taken to London, where Miss Prowse won the British equivalent of a Tony Award.         After she broke off her engagement with Mr. Sinatra, Miss Prowse settled down to a series of long-term relationships but generally avoided matrimony. There was a brief early marriage she never talked about, and in 1980, just after giving birth to their son, she married John McCook, an actor. They were later divorced.         To those who worked with her, Miss Prowse's most striking feature was neither her long, shapely legs nor her dancing skills, but her sunny disposition and her perpetual good cheer even in the face of one disaster or another, like the time in 1987 when she was mauled by a leopard while rehearsing for a television special called ''Circus of the Stars.''         As her longtime manager, Mark Mordoh, noted on Saturday, none of her friends were surprised that Miss Prowse was convinced that the same dedication and hard work that had brought her a successful show business career would lead to a victory over her cancer, discovered in 1994.         ''Even while she was getting chemotherapy,'' Mr. Mordoh said, ''she was teaching yoga classes.''         Miss Prowse is survived by her son, Seth McCook, of Los Angeles; her mother, Phylis Polte, and a brother, Dr. Clive Prowse, both of Vanderbijl Park, South Africa, and her companion, B. J. Allen.       
         The actress and film director Christine Pascal, who made her movie acting debut at 21 and directed her first film at 25, has died at the age of 42, her husband's production agency said yesterday in Paris.         The agency, Armedia, founded by Ms. Pascal's husband, Richard Boner, did not give the cause of her death, which it said occurred late on Friday or early Saturday. The newspaper Le Monde said it was suicide.         Ms. Pascal began her film career in 1973 with a role in ''The Clockmaker,'' a well-received movie directed by Bertrand Tavernier and starring Philippe Noiret. Mr. Tavernier also directed her in four other movies, including ''Round Midnight'' (1985), a homage to bebop set in 50's Paris,  and ''Spoiled Children'' (1977), about a blocked writer-director who becomes involved with a younger woman.         She had roles in ''Black Thursday'' (1975), a film by Michel Mitrani about the roundup of Jews in Paris during the German occupation, and ''The Grand Highway'' (1987), the story of a 9-year-old boy who spends three weeks in a rural village.         In 1992 she won the Louis Delluc Prize for directing ''Le Petit Prince a Dit'' (''The Little Prince Said''). The most recent film she directed was ''Adultere: Mode d'Emploi'' (''Adultery: A User's Guide''),  which came out last year and was part of the Hamptons Film Festival.         ''I'm completely in shock, I can't believe it,'' Mr. Tavernier told the radio station RTL. ''She was someone who doubted herself, who experienced depression, whom you had to encourage constantly because she was afraid,'' he added. ''She was extraordinarily sensitive, and she showed it in the films she made as a director and as an actress.''       
         Elizabeth Bottomley Noyce, a microchip millionaire's scorned first wife who showed as much imagination and verve in deploying her half of his Silicon Valley fortune as he had in making it, died on Tuesday at her seaside home in Bremen, Me. She was 65 and had been the state's premier philanthropist and most innovative investor for two decades.         Her lawyer, Owen Wells, noting that Mrs. Noyce had long suffered from emphysema, said the cause was a heart attack.         The daughter of a blue-collar worker from Auburn, Mass., who had to hold two jobs to support his family in the Depression, Mrs. Noyce was majoring in English at Tufts University in the early 1950's and dreaming of becoming a writer when she signed on as costume director of a summer theatrical production and caught the eye of one of the cast members, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Robert N. Noyce.         The couple were married in 1953, and Mrs. Noyce, who had dreamed of writing novels and short stories, became the most dutiful of corporate wives, bearing four children and following her husband from job to job, including a somewhat reluctant move to California for a woman who never felt comfortable away from her beloved New England.         ''We were under the distinct impression that we would try it for a year and if I didn't like it we wouldn't stay,'' she recalled years later, suggesting that her husband had forgotten the bargain: ''We stayed 19 years.''         By then the life of the blue-collar worker's daughter had changed considerably, largely because her husband had become a co-inventor of the microchip, which laid the foundation for the vast personal computer industry, and had helped found three of the industry's premier companies, including the giant Intel Corporation.         Her life changed even more in 1975 when Mr. Noyce left her to marry an Intel executive. Although bitter over the circumstances of the breakup of her marriage, Mrs. Noyce, whose husband died in 1990, managed to console herself somewhat in the divorce. Under California's community property laws she claimed half his Intel stock and all his other assets, including full title to their 50-acre Maine estate, where Mrs. Noyce had been spending summers.         How much she received from the divorce could not be determined yesterday, and a spokesman for Intel, which has a market capitalization of $86 billion, could not say how much stock she owned at the time of her death. Mr. Wells, her lawyer, said, however, that after all her charitable donations, her estate was worth $100 million to $1 billion.         Putting her husband and California behind her, Mrs. Noyce did not so much move to Maine as adopt the state.         In a whirlwind of philanthropy that began almost as soon as she settled into her house on Muscongus Bay and continued the rest of her life, she systematically gave away some $75 million, primarily to Maine charities.         Oh, there would be the occasional out-of-state donation -- a million to Tufts here, a half-million to Harvard there -- but for the most part Mrs. Noyce, whose donations covered the gamut of public causes including education, medicine, the arts and the environment, concentrated her giving in Maine, responding to virtually any cause, charity or public institution in the state that needed money.         Among other things, she built a golf course for the town of Bremen, gave lavishly to the Portland Museum of Art, the Maine Maritime Museum and the University of Maine. When the Cumberland County Civic Center was so pressed for cash that it was looking for a corporate sponsor that would give it money in exchange for the right to give the center its name, Mrs. Noyce came through with a $1.3 million donation that allowed the center to retain its identity.         But for all the acclaim Mrs. Noyce received for her direct philanthropy, including the $15 million in endowments for charitable trusts that make independent grants to Maine charities, Mrs. Noyce gained even more applause when she began pioneering what she called ''catalytic philanthropy,'' investments designed to bolster the state's economy.         In 1991, for example, when out-of-state financial institutions were picking off Maine's banks one by one and it appeared that Maine businesses and other borrowers would soon be at the mercy of distant lenders, Mrs. Noyce blithely created a brand new bank, the Maine Bank and Trust Company with an initial $7.7 million investment that eventually grew to some $14 million.         What made such ''philanthropy,'' especially appealing became apparent when the bank prospered. Mr. Wells, who advised Mrs. Noyce on her investments, estimated yesterday that the bank was now worth at least twice what she paid for it.         During a lull in Maine's construction industry, Mrs. Noyce built five homes to provide jobs for construction workers, and when Maine's leading bakery was threatened with a takeover by a company that intended to move it out of state, Mrs. Noyce came to the rescue, buying the bakery and saving its 1,200 jobs.         Recently Mrs. Noyce had turned her attention to Portland's deteriorating downtown, going on a buying spree in which she acquired about 10 percent of the city's office and retail space. The rehabilitation effort attracted L. L. Bean and other tenants.         Although her efforts won wide praise, there were some rumblings that Mrs. Noyce was becoming too big a factor in the Portland economy and she had recently announced that she had no further designs on downtown property.         For all her wealth, Mrs. Noyce lived fairly simply, shunning the usual trappings of wealth and even driving her own car, most recently a Cadillac, to be sure, but only, she told her friends, because after a wreck in her smaller Oldsmobile, she felt more secure in a larger car.         Although she was always appropriately dressed, Mrs. Noyce had no interest in fashion and even less in travel, preferring to stay in Maine rather than visit the world's resorts.         Not that she was above the occasional indulgence. When she found that the steep driveway to her house became dangerously slick with wintertime ice, she built a more accessible winter home a thousand feet away.         Her only real material weakness stemmed from her love of the water, but it was a tribute to her reputation for innovative ''catalytic philanthropy,'' that when she indulged her passion by commissioning a multimillion-dollar 60-foot yacht a few years ago, the acquisition was not viewed in Maine as an example of conspicuous consumption. Instead the purchase was trumpeted in the Maine press as a rescue of Maine's boat-building industry.         In recent months Mrs. Noyce had apparently developed renewed concern about the state's beleaguered boat builders. She had commissioned a 90-foot yacht.         Mrs. Noyce is survived by a son, William, of Hollis, N.H.; three daughters, Pendred of Weston, Mass.; Priscilla, of Kenya and Margaret, of Montana; two brothers, Frank Bottomley of Ohio and Bruce, of New Hampshire; a sister, Frances Broomhead of Rhode Island, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Lamour, whose sarong-draped charms adorned many films of the late 1930's and 40's, especially the ''road'' pictures she made with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, died yesterday at her home in North Hollywood, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Lamour, a comely brunette who was also a favorite pinup of thousands of G.I.'s during World War II, was in her heyday at a time when the major studios believed that certain actresses needed something of a signature. Veronica Lake peered out from behind the lock of hair that invariably hid part of her face; Miss Lamour had her trademark sarong.  She wore that clinging garment in a series of films, from the 1936 ''Jungle Princess'' through such 1940's comedies as ''Road to Singapore'' and ''Road to Morocco.''         Miss Lamour appeared in seven of the road pictures, in which she was always the exotic but demure girl invariably won by a crooning Mr. Crosby at the expense of a more comedic Mr. Hope. On occasion, Miss Lamour would join Mr. Crosby in a ballad, such as ''Moonlight Becomes You'' or ''Constantly.'' By the late 1940's, her salary rose to a top of around $450,000 a movie.         But she had no illusions about either her acting or singing ability. Asked by an interviewer if she had ever studied acting or singing, she replied, ''No, can't you tell?''         During World War II, Miss Lamour was also known as ''the bond bombshell'' because of the volunteer work she did selling United States War Bonds. In tours around the country, she was credited with selling some $300 million of the bonds. So  effective was she as a saleswoman that the Government put a private railroad car at her disposal when she decided to go on a bond tour.         She received a belated citation for her bond work from the Treasury in 1965, at which time William H. Neal, at that time the director of the United States Savings Bond Division, credited her with being the first star to offer her services to sell war bonds and the originator of the successful Government plan for payroll deductions for those who wanted part of their salaries set aside for war bond purchases.         Her contributions to the war effort did not stop there. She was frequently seen at the Hollywood Canteen, the nightclub for servicemen founded by Bette Davis and John Garfield, where she spent many hours talking to and dancing with G.I.'s.         Miss Lamour was born on Dec. 10, 1914, in New Orleans as Mary Leta Dorothy Slaton, the daughter of John Watson Slaton and the former Carmen Louise La Porte. Her father was a waiter. Her mother, who soon divorced her father, worked as a waitress.         Young Dorothy never finished high school. The family finances were so desperate that when she was 15, she forged her mother's name to a document that authorized her to drop out of school.         Later, however, she did go to a secretarial school that did not require her to have a high school diploma. She regarded herself as an excellent typist and usually typed her own letters, even after she became quite wealthy.         After she won the 1931 Miss New Orleans beauty contest, she and her mother moved to Chicago, where  Miss Lamour earned $17 a week as an elevator operator for the Marshall Field department store on State Street. She had no training as a singer but was persuaded by a friend to try out for a female vocalist's spot with Herbie Kay, a band leader who  had a national radio show called ''The Yeast Foamers,'' apparently because it was sponsored by Fleischmann's Yeast.         She left Mr. Kay's group and moved to Manhattan, where Rudy Vallee, then a popular singer, helped her get a singing job at a popular night club, El Morocco. She later worked at 1 Fifth Avenue, a cabaret where she met Louis B. Mayer, the Hollywood studio chief. It was Mayer who eventually arranged for her to have a screen test, which led to her Paramount contract in 1935.         When she was at her zenith as a star, her fans suggested that an agent had adopted her last name from the French word for ''love'' as a box-office ploy. In fact, the name was close to one in the family; Miss Lamour adapted it herself from Lambour, which was the last name of her stepfather, Clarence, to whom her mother was briefly married.         Miss Lamour's more than 50 films included ''Typhoon'' (1939), ''Johnny Apollo'' (1940), ''The Fleet's In'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942), ''Duffy's Tavern'' (1945),  ''Here Comes the Groom'' (1951), ''Donovan's Reef'' (1962) and ''Pajama Party'' (1964).         The seven movies in which she appeared with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope were ''Road to Singapore (1940), ''Road to Zanzibar'' (1941), ''Road to Morocco'' (1942), ''Road to Utopia'' (1946), ''Road to Rio'' (1948) ''Road to Bali'' (1953) and ''Road to Hong Kong'' (1962). Although Miss Lamour worked closely with Mr. Hope and Crosby for many years, she said that she was not close to them personally.         Miss Lamour's first marriage, to Herbie Kay, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, William  Ross Howard 3d, in 1943 while she was on a bond tour. Mr. Howard, who had interests in the frozen food and advertising businesses, died in 1978.         After she retired from the movies, Miss Lamour remained active. In 1968, she starred in the national road show production of ''Hello, Dolly!'' And in 1969, she was named to the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore, where she then lived. She was active in various causes there for many years. In the 1980's, she worked the cabaret circuit, where she sang many of the songs she had sung in her movies.         In the 1987 film ''Creepshow 2,'' she played a sloppily dressed housewife who gets murdered. ''Well, at my age you can't lean against a palm tree and sing 'Moon of Monakoora,''' she said. ''People would look at that and say, 'What is she trying to do?' ''         While ''Creepshow 2'' was her only film role in two decades, she was frequently seen on television, doing guest shots such shows as ''The Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and, naturally, a few Bob Hope specials.         She is survived by her two sons, John Ridgley Howard and Tom Howard; a stepson, William Ross Howard 4th; a grandson, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  September 24, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Dorothy Lamour yesterday reversed parts of the name of her second husband in some copies. He was William Ross Howard 3d, not William Howard Ross 3d.       
         Dr. Lucy Frank Squire, a radiologist who became known as a medical educator, died on Sept. 15 at her home on the West Side of Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, said her son, Gordon Squire of Williamstown, Mass.         Dr. Squire retired in 1993 as Distinguished Service Professor of Radiology at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn. The center announced her death on Friday.         Born in Washington, she received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University and a degree in 1940 from the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania, now the Medical College of Pennsylvania.         At first, she was unable to decide whether she wanted to be a radiologist or a pathologist, so she chose to take her first year of residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, since it offered six months of radiology and six months of pathology. But the director of the pathology department did not want a female resident, so Dr. Squire turned to radiology.         After completing her residency in 1945 and having a practice in Syracuse, she joined the faculty of the University of Rochester and received a grant to write a radiology textbook for medical students. Her durable and widely used book, ''Fundamentals of Radiology,'' was published in 1964. Its fourth edition (Harvard, 1988), which she wrote with Dr. Robert A. Novelline, is expected to be supplanted by a fifth in 1997.         In 1966, she began teaching part time at Massachusetts General Hospital and at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, now the State University of New York Science Center. From 1972 until her retirement, she was a professor of radiology at the center.         In those years, she was the lead author of another durable work, a series of self-instructional texts for medical students, ''Exercises in Diagnostic Radiology'' (Saunders). She was also a co-author of ''Living Anatomy'' (Hanley & Belfus, 1987).         She received awards from the Radiological Society of North America, the Association of University Radiologists and the Regional Conference on Women in Medicine. In 1987, she won the first Marie Curie Award from the American Association of Women Radiologists.         Her marriage in 1937 to Charles F. Squire ended after a decade.

         Beryl Reid, the versatile British character actress who won a Tony Award in 1967 for her performance in ''The Killing of Sister George'' and was one of the most popular stars on the London stage and on British television, died on Sunday. She was 76.         She had developed pneumonia after undergoing a knee operation, her agent, Robert Luff, said. He would not say where she died.         Ms. Reid, who specialized in eccentric characters, had been a stand-up comic and variety entertainer for 30 years before making the transition to more serious acting. She performed in plays by Joe Orton, Edward Albee and Peter Nichols, as well as in classics for the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater.         She had her greatest success as June Buckridge in Frank Marcus's ''Killing of Sister George.'' June was a lusty, cigar-smoking soap opera actress whose role as a rural nurse named Sister George was being excised from a long-running radio serial. In the play, which was a hit both in London and New York, Ms. Reid and Eileen Atkins portrayed a lesbian couple in a disintegrating relationship.         Friends had warned Ms. Reid not to touch the play ''with a barge pole,'' thinking that the role would damage her image. Instead, it made her international reputation. She later starred in the Robert Aldrich film version, with Susannah York replacing Ms. Atkins. Sister George became her signature role, but it was one of several peaks in her career.         She played the seductive landlady in the film of Joe Orton's ''Entertaining Mr. Sloane'' and recreated that role in a 1975 revival of the play at the Royal Court Theater. Subsequently, she won more admirers in the United States and London through television, especially from her role opposite Alec Guinness in the dramatizations of John le Carre's ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' and ''Smiley's People.'' Ms. Reid was Connie Sachs, George Smiley's former research aide, who, despite her drinking, retained her exceptional memory.         Ms. Reid was born in Hereford, England. Leaving school at 16, she made her debut in 1936 as a music hall performer at the Floral Hall, Bridlington. Before and during World War II, she took part in variety shows and pantomimes. Her comic imagination was certified on the BBC radio series ''Educating Archie,'' in which she created and played two contrasting roles, a schoolgirl in love with a ventriloquist's dummy and an earthy teen-ager with airs.         In 1951, she made her London stage debut in ''After the Show,'' followed by a series of musical revues, in which she demonstrated the transforming ability of a chameleon. She said she usually played 16 to 18 characters in one night and never looked the same. After Ms. Reid appeared in a revue sketch by Harold Pinter in 1959, Harold Clurman called her ''a real artist and trouper with technical command.''         ''Sister George,'' first presented in Bristol and in London in 1965, was her breakthrough. Later she acted in Mr. Albee's ''Counting the Ways'' at the National, in Congreve's ''Way of the World'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company and in Mr. Nichols's ''Born in the Gardens.''         Her films include ''The Belles of St. Trinian's,'' ''The Dock Brief'' (renamed ''Trial and Error'' in the United States), ''Inspector Clouseau'' and Dylan Thomas's ''Doctor and the Devils.''         In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby described her role in ''Joseph Andrews'' in 1977 as ''a battered, flirtatious crone with the manners of a truck driver trying to be dainty.''         Ms. Reid wrote an autobiography, ''So Much Love,'' and was the co-author of ''Cats' Whiskers'' and ''Beryl, Food and Friends.'' In 1986 she was awarded the Order of the British Empire.         Married and divorced twice, she lived in a cottage in Wraysbury, outside London. No immediate family members survive.       
         Eleanor Frances Cameron, an award-winning writer of children's books, died on Friday at Hospice House in Monterey, Calif. She was 84 and lived in Pebble Beach, Calif.         Mrs. Cameron was the author of 17 children's books. She began her writing career in 1950 with ''The Unheard Music,'' her one book for adults, and published her first children's book, ''The Wonderful Flight to the Mushroom Planet,'' in 1954. That book, an adventure about space travel, inspired four ''Mushroom Planet'' sequels.         ''The Court of the Stone Children'' (1973), a complex tale involving ghostly apparitions in modern-day San Francisco, won her a National Book Award. She was a semifinalist for the award in 1979, for ''To the Green Mountains.'' Her other books include ''The Green and Burning Tree,'' ''The Beast With the Magical Horn,'' ''The Mysterious Christmas Shell'' and ''A Room Made of Windows,'' about a girl's journey to becoming a writer.         Mrs. Cameron was born in 1912, in Winnipeg, Manitoba. Her family moved to Ohio when she was 3, and then to California.         She is survived by a son, David, of Santa Monica, Calif.       
         Laura La Plante, an early screen star who made the transition from silent screams to audible sobs and songs, died on Monday at the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 92.         In a career in which she appeared in some 75 films, many in the silent era, Miss La Plante was cast primarily as a comedian but demonstrated considerable dramatic range.         If a villain needed a heroine to tie to the railroad tracks in the face of an onrushing train, for example, Miss La Plante could be counted on to wriggle and squirm convincingly until the hero rescued her in the nick of time.         Perhaps her most famous role was as the heroine in the 1927 silent classic, ''The Cat and the Canary,'' still studied as the progenitor of the English manor house movie thriller, in this case with flashes of comedy.         She also became something of a footnote to Hollywood history as the first woman to sing on screen when she was actually heard singing and sobbing in the original film version of ''Show Boat,'' in 1929.         The daughter of a Missouri farmer with an ear for alliteration, Miss La Plante, who was born on a farm outside St. Louis, really was given that unlikely name at birth, almost. The original version of La Plante, her son explained yesterday, had no ''e'' at the end, but she added one, without prompting by studio executives, after friends pointed out it needed a proper feminine French ending to go with the ''La.''         At a time when movie acting was not regarded as entirely respectable, Miss La Plante, who came to Hollywood with her schoolteacher mother after her parents' divorce, got her first job on a lark, winning a role as an extra at the age of 15.         Within two years, she had won a contract from Universal and was well on her way to becoming one of the most famous women in America, appearing first in Hoot Gibson westerns and the like and then in leading roles opposite Reginald Denny, especially after the director William Seitzer persuaded her to bob and bleach her long brown hair.         She and Mr. Seitzer were married in 1926 and divorced in 1932, three months before Miss La Plante, who had been making a movie in London, married Irving Asher, a producer who had been running the Warner Brothers studio in London.         For all the bride's movie star fame, the couple were upstaged at their wedding by their official witness, Mr. Asher's pal, the former New York City Mayor, James J. Walker.         The next year, while Miss La Plante was staying at Mr. Walker's thatched-roof cottage in Surrey, the house burned to the ground, destroying all the papers and documents he had accumulated during his two years in office before resigning under a cloud in 1932.         Although there were some sniggling suggestions that the papers, at least, had been deliberately torched to hide evidence of the former Mayor's suspected corruption, Miss La Plante's son insisted that the fire had been entirely accidental. Indeed, he said, when his mother, who was ill in bed at the time and eventually had to be carried to safety out a window, was told by a maid that ''the thatch is alight, Mum,'' she shrugged off the news, thinking merely that a cozy fire had been started in the fireplace.         Miss La Plante largely retired from the screen after her marriage, making only a few movies after that while becoming a somewhat offbeat Hollywood hostess.         When friends like William Holden or Hal Wallis came to dine, Mr. Asher inevitably did the cooking, while Miss La Plante, who had learned the art in London from Somerset Maugham's wife, Syrie, wowed the guests with her stunning flower arrangements.         Miss La Plante, whose husband died in 1985, is survived by a daughter, Jill Murray of Mill Valley, Calif.; a son, Tony Asher of Los Angeles, and a grandson.         Correction:  October 22, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Laura La Plante on Thursday misspelled the surname of her first husband. He was William Seiter.       
         Grace E. Bessay, who won a prolonged legal struggle to keep the Federal Government from ousting her from a two-room summer shanty on Cape Cod, died on Oct. 10 in Cambridge, Mass. where she had her main home for 50 years. She was 84.         Her death was reported yesterday by The Associated Press. The cause of death and where in Cambridge she died were not disclosed.         Ms. Bessay, a retired bookkeeper, reached agreement with the National Park Service in 1991 -- shortly before she was to be evicted -- to settle her lawsuit.         Under the settlement, she received a cash settlement and permission to keep on using the primitive cottage -- her longtime summer home, on an eight-acre site -- for 25 more years.         ''I'll be making use of it for all the 25 years,'' she said triumphantly.         Her shanty was one of 17 simple cottages on a small compound, in the dunes of Truro and Provincetown, within the 43,000-acre Cape Cod National Seashore. The cottages were once retreats for writers like E. E. Cummings, Jack Kerouac, Norman Mailer and Eugene O'Neill.         In 1967, the National Park Service claimed the structures as part of the Cape Cod National Seashore. The owners of 16 cottages later signed agreements with the Park Service that let them continue using them for 25 additional years.         But the 17th owner, Andrew Fuller, declined to sign and continued a lawsuit. He died in 1981, and Ms. Bessay, a longtime friend, inherited his shanty and the suit. Just before she settled it, she declared: ''I'm looking for security so they can't come and throw me out.''         Ms. Bessay was born in Akron, Ohio, received a degree from Akron University and also studied at Radcliffe College.       
         Hermine Baron, one of America's top-ranked female bridge players, died in Los Angeles on Sept. 27. She was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her former husband, Arthur Baron of Los Angeles.         For the last 22 years, Mrs. Baron had more master points than any other female player, ending with 22,645 and the title of grand life master. From 1975 to 1983, she was ranked second among all players by the American Contract Bridge League, and was 10th when she died.         In 1964 and 1970, she won the McKenney Trophy, awarded for winning the most points in a calendar year.In 1964, she set a points record.         Mrs. Baron was a member of the United States Women's Team that took third place in the 1968 world championships in Deauville, France, and she competed in the World Women's Pairs Championship in 1978 and 1982. In national competition, she won the Life Master Pairs in 1966 and five other titles: the Women's Teams in 1964 and 1968; the Women's Pairs in 1968 and 1982, and the Life Master Women's Pairs in 1963. She finished second seven times.         Mrs. Baron was born in Omaha and stricken with polio at the age of 13, after which she was confined to a wheelchair.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Jerry Hirschman of Chicago.       
         Mignon G. Eberhart, a highly prolific author of mystery novels who specialized in stories that combined romance and suspense, died yesterday in the Nathaniel Witherell nursing home in Greenwich, Conn., where she lived. She was 97.         In a 60-year career, Mrs. Eberhardt was one of the most popular mystery writers and one of the most highly paid. She wrote 59 books, including novels and several collections of stories. Her first mystery was published in 1929 and her last, ''Three Days for Emeralds,'' in 1988, when she was in her late 80's.         Her novels have been translated into more than 20 languages, and in the 1930's many of them were turned into movies. Several of her books are still in print, and six of her early novels were recently republished by the University of Nebraska Press.         Reviewing Mrs. Eberhart's ''Next of Kin'' in 1982, Newgate Callendar wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book ''contains all of the formulas she has so successfully conjured up through the years -- rich families, nice people, romance, something of a locked-room mystery, lots of suspects.''         Mignon Good was born in Lincoln, Neb., on July 6, 1899. She studied for three years at Nebraska Wesleyan University. In 1923, soon after her marriage to Alanson Eberhart, an engineer, she began writing in earnest.         ''The Dark Corridor,'' a novella, was printed in 1925 in Flynn's, a detective magazine. Her first novel,  ''The Patient in Room 18,'' featured Nurse Sarah Keate, an amateur sleuth who worked with a young detective, Lance O'Leary. With or without Detective O'Leary, Nurse Sarah starred in other Eberhart mysteries and was played on the screen by Aline MacMahon, Jane Darwell and Ann Sheridan. Mrs. Eberhart's other detectives included Susan Dare, a mystery writer, and James Wickwire, a banker.         With her penchant for plucky heroines in distress, Mrs. Eberhart was considered a disciple of Mary Roberts Rinehart, but eventually she became known as a writer of romance mysteries with a touch of the gothic. In this area she influenced writers like Mary Higgins Clark.         Her atmospheric stories often took place in exotic locales: Hong Kong, Lisbon, the Caribbean. Among her books are ''While the Patient Slept'' (her second novel, which won the $5,000 Scotland Yard Prize in 1930), ''Never Look Back,'' ''Call After Midnight,'' ''Run Scared,'' ''Speak No Evil'' and ''With This Ring.'' In collaboration with Robert Wallsten, she adapted her novel ''Fair Warning,'' into a play, ''Eight O'Clock Tuesday,'' which ran on Broadway in 1941.         When she was asked to name her favorite writers, she said that she never missed a book by Agatha Christie or Ngaio Marsh. ''They are old friends, of course. But my real love is for the brotherhood and sisterhood of the genre.'' She added, ''I love mystery writers as a breed, and am so glad to belong.''         No immediate family members survive.       
         Diane Dickerson Montgomery, a former psychiatric social worker and bank officer who was involved in civil rights causes since childhood, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 62 and also had homes in Lubec, Me., and Key West, Fla.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Charles H. Montgomery.         A graduate of the Francis Parker School in Chicago and Mills College in Oakland, Calif., she earned a master's degree in social work at the University of Chicago and went to work for several public and private agencies. She later joined the First National Bank of Chicago as an officer in the trust department.         Her early advocacy of racial equality was inspired by her father, Earl B. Dickerson, a prominent Chicago civil-rights lawyer and 30-year board member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mr. Dickerson, who won major legal battles involving housing segregation in Chicago, took her along as a child when he visited whites-only restaurants, was refused service and sued their owners.         Later, barred from the dining room of a major Chicago hotel, she asked her father's advice. ''Sue,'' he said. She did, and won.         Mr. Dickerson died in 1986.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Stephen Brown of Oak Park, Ill., and Joshua Cohen of Chicago; a daughter, Judith Cohen Brown of Seattle; a stepdaughter, Alison Montgomery of Chicago; a stepson, Douglas Montgomery of Libertyville, Ill., and two grandchildren.       
         Former Representative Coya Knutson of Minnesota, a fierce champion of family farms, medical research and campaign finance reform and the creator of Federal student loans, died at a nursing home in Edina, Minn., on Thursday, her legislative achievements all but overshadowed by her vindictive husband's ''Coya, Come Home'' campaign that led to her defeat after two terms in 1958. She was 82.         Her son, Terry, said the cause was kidney failure.         If there had ever been any doubts that a woman's place is in the House, they must surely have been dispelled in 1954 when the former Coya Gjesdal unseated a six-term Republican and swept into Congress like a whirlwind from northern Minnesota.         There had been women in Congress continuously for more than 30 years, and Mrs. Knutson, although the first from Minnesota, was one of seven elected in 1954. But it is safe to say that the House had never seen anything quite like her.         A Norwegian immigrant's daughter who grew up on a North Dakota farm, graduated from Concordia College in 1934 and spent a year studying voice and piano at the Juilliard School before returning to North Dakota to teach school, she married in 1940 and settled in the little town of Oklee, Minn., just across the state line.         She and her husband operated a small hotel cum cafe until Mrs. Knutson, a populist inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt, got the political bug and made a successful run for the Minnesota Legislature in 1950.         A tireless campaigner who accompanied herself on the accordion while singing her own campaign song in a lilting soprano, she stunned the Minnesota political establishment when she won the 1954 Congressional election, and when she got to Washington she stunned Congress even more.         Despite her lack of seniority, Mrs. Knutson promptly won a place on the House Agriculture Committee. She subsequently initiated the first Federal appropriations for cystic fibrosis research, introduced the first bill calling for the income tax checkoff to finance Presidential election campaigns and originated the idea and the legislation that established the Federal student loan program.         Mrs. Knutson was an independent-minded woman, and she made her share of political enemies along the way. But, despite opposition from some leaders of her own Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, she appeared headed for a long and brilliant career in Congress as her second term drew to a close.         Then, in May 1958, when her party declined to formally endorse Mrs. Knutson for a third term, forcing her to run in a primary to seek re-election, Andy Knutson, the farmhand she had married 18 years earlier, dropped a bombshell.         In an open letter to his wife, he urged her to leave Congress and return to what he described as the ''happy home we once enjoyed.''         Never mind that Mr. Knutson, who had once worked on her father's farm in North Dakota, had not shared a bedroom with his wife for years or that he had regularly beaten her so badly during her visits to Minnesota, as their son later recalled it, that she had to wear dark glasses to hide her black eyes from her fellow members of Congress.         Once the resulting ''Coya, Come Home,'' newspaper headline was carried across the country, it created a firestorm of publicity that accepted Mr. Knutson's story as the plaintive truth and portrayed his wife as an uncaring wife who had abandoned her family for political ambition.         Mr. Knutson later stirred the fire by accusing his wife of having an affair with a legislative aide half her age, but although the charge was a blatant fabrication, Mrs. Knutson refused to denounce her husband.         She managed to win the primary, but lost the general election by 1,390 votes to Odin Langen, a Republican who was 6 feet 4 inches tall and campaigned on the slogan, ''A Big Man for a Man-Sized Job.'' There was never any doubt that the ''Coya, Come Home,'' campaign had cost Mrs. Knutson the election, and as it turned out, her political career.         She failed in a comeback bid in 1960, divorced her husband in 1962, and then spent a dozen years working in the Defense Department in Washington before trying another abortive race in 1977, polling 13 percent of the vote in a primary in which one of her opponents was her former legislative aide.         According to her son, who was adopted when he was 8 over the objections of his father, Mrs. Knutson, a deeply religious woman who frequently cited the biblical passage, ''Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord,'' never expressed bitterness toward her husband.         But she was also apparently content to leave forgiveness to the Lord. When Mr. Knutson died of acute alcohol poisoning in 1969, she did not attend his funeral.         Besides her son, of Bloomington, Minn., Mrs. Knutson is survived by two sisters, Helen Riets of Devil's Lake, N.D., and Crystal Greguson of Edina, two grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Ruth E. Moskowitz of Brooklyn, a justice of the New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, died on Nov. 2 at Mount Sinai Medical Center. A native and lifetime resident of Brooklyn Heights, she was 60.         Her family said the cause was scleroderma, a rheumatological disorder.         Judge Moskowitz first won election to the State Supreme Court in 1982 and was assigned to Criminal Term, Kings County. She was re-elected posthumously this month to a second 14-year term.         She received a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's from the University of Connecticut, then joined the civil rights movement in the summer of 1961. On a mission to integrate a Jackson, Miss., lunch counter, she was arrested and charged with trespassing.         While in solitary confinement in a Mississippi state prison, she made a decision to go into law. She graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1964 and went to work for the Legal Aid Society. She was in private practice when she first ran for Civil Court in 1976.         Over the years, she presided over many cases of Medicaid fraud and official corruption. In 1988, one of her cases produced a memorable encounter with Mayor Edward I. Koch.  At issue was the forbearance she had shown to a score of former parking-meter collectors who had pocketed thousands of dollars. Because they had no prior records, she had accepted their guilty pleas and given them sentences that involved no jail time, fines or restitution. Mayor Koch was moved to appear in person to support the demand for such penalties by the Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman.         The judge scolded the Mayor for his trouble, pointing out that he was lavishing his attention on a case involving ''little people.'' She also faulted what she called the administration's sloppy supervision.         Yes, she told the Mayor, little people become malefactors, too, but they have rights. She added that the defendants ''are going to be treated just the way the big boys are being treated,'' alluding to politically connected officials involved in recent corruption scandals. She declined to amend her decision.         Justice Moskowitz served on professional panels, in the Office of Court Administration and the New York Task Force on Women in the Courts.         She is survived by her husband, Martin Gershon; a daughter, Leah, and two sons, Joel and Robert, all of Brooklyn Heights; a sister, Anne Lyons of Manhattan, and her mother, Gussie Moskowitz, also of Brooklyn.       
         Virginia Cherrill, a 1930's actress who starred as a beautiful, blind flower girl in the classic Charlie Chaplin silent film ''City Lights'' (1931), died late Thursday in a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 88 and had settled in Santa Barbara in 1950.         Miss Cherrill was born near Carthage, Ill. and educated at schools in Kenosha, Wis., and Chicago.         After an early marriage to Irving Adler, a Chicago lawyer, ended in divorce, she went to California to recover and met Chaplin there. He has variously been said to have first noticed her on a California beach and when they were both at a boxing match.         David Robinson, film critic for The Times of London, wrote in a 1985 biography of Chaplin that the actor gave Miss Cherrill the part of the flower girl largely because she portrayed a blind person appealingly, in a test, after he advised her to look at him but ''to look inwardly and not to see me.''         In the movie, Chaplin starred opposite her as a little tramp who fell in love with her. Its final scene, with close-ups of Miss Cherrill, has won special praise. The writer and critic James Agee called it ''enough to shrivel the heart to see, the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies.''         Miss Cherrill starred in several other American-made movies in the early 1930's and met Cary Grant at a film premiere. They were married in 1933, and she went on to retire briefly from movie making.         Their divorce came in 1935. Then she resumed her career, again briefly, in Britain, where she acted in two films. Later she said, ''I was no great shakes as an actress.''         She retired from movie making for good when she began her nine-year marriage to the ninth Earl of Jersey, in 1937.         As the Countess of Jersey, she did charity work in Britain during World War II.         She is survived by her husband of 48 years, Florian Martini, a World War II flying ace.       
         Meridel Le Sueur, who reported on the plight of the poor during the Depression and celebrated the free spirits of early Americans in her fiction for children, died on Nov. 14 in Hudson Memorial Hospital in Hudson, Wis. She was 96 and had lived in the hospital's residential unit in nearby St. Paul, Minn., for the last few years.         Miss Le Sueur, a native of Murray, Iowa, grew up among the radical farmer and labor groups that informed her youth, like the Populists, the Farmers Alliance and the Wobblies, the Industrial Workers of the World. Her first story was published  in a literary magazine in 1927, and she kept writing into her 90's.         Her mother and stepfather, Marion Wharton and Alfred Le Sueur, were ardent socialists who imbued her with an idealism that never left her. Just beyond their Middle Western kitchen the world was filled with  eloquent radicals: Big Bill Haywood, Eugene V. Debs, Lincoln Steffens and Emma Goldman.         Largely self-taught, Miss Le Sueur teamed with kindred souls in literary communal relationships and, sent East by her mother, moved in with Goldman while attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She came to know John Reed and met Theodore Dreiser and Edna St. Vincent Millay at Mabel Dodge's literary salon.         She won acclaim in 1927 for her story ''Persephone'' and again in 1934 for ''The Horse,'' a strange, powerful novella. With her distinctly personal style of journalism, she rendered detailed observation with a sense of political urgency. She reported on bread lines and unemployment offices and on deserted mining towns and desolate farms.         Blacklisted during the McCarthy period, she continued to write, turning out experimental prose works, novels and poems and storing them in her basement in Minnesota.         Her highly praised children's books, in which she interwove history and regional lore in poetic prose, included ''Little Brother of the Wilderness: The Story of Johnny Appleseed,'' ''Nancy Hanks of Wilderness Road: A Story of Abraham Lincoln's Mother,'' ''Sparrow Hawk'' and ''Chanticleer of Wilderness Road: A Story of Davy Crockett.''         Miss Le Sueur's own wilderness relented as collections of her prose began to appear in the 1970's. Her recovery culminated in ''Ripening: Selected Work, 1927-1980'' (Feminist Press, 1982), a clear reflection of how she had listened from childhood to the stories of immigrants and Indian women.         An early milestone in her career was ''North Star Country'' (1945), the story of how Minnesota and Wisconsin were settled. It was reprinted by the University of Nebraska Press in 1984. Her recent work included ''The Dread Road'' (1991), a novel about a mining strike in Colorado.         She is survived by two daughters, Rachel Tilsen of Hudson and Deborah Le Sueur of Graton, Calif.; 8 grandchildren; 27 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Lansing Dulles, an economic specialist for the State Department who played a major part in planning the reconstruction of West Berlin in the 1950's, died on Wednesday in the Knollwood military retirement home in Washington. She was 101.         Her death was reported by The Associated Press on Friday.         Mrs. Dulles, who was sometimes called ''the Mother of Berlin'' for her enthusiastic efforts to revitalize the economy and culture of that battered capital as it recovered from World War II, managed to carve for herself a formidable reputation even though her two brothers, John Foster Dulles and Allen Welsh Dulles, held much higher rank in the American Government.         She was offered the State Department's Berlin desk in 1952, just before Foster Dulles was named Secretary of State.         She quickly saw trouble coming, she said in a memoir published in 1980, because Foster had been criticized for using his influence to get Allen the top job in the C.I.A. and wanted to avoid further accusations of nepotism. She was already a career diplomat, and her West Berlin position came through before Mr. Dulles's appointment, yet once he was in office, he tried to force her out. He did not succeed, she noted with some satisfaction.         Mrs. Dulles said it was difficult for a woman to serve in the State Department in that era.         ''This place is a real man's world if ever there was one,'' she said in 1958. ''It's riddled with prejudices. If you are a woman in Government service you just have to work 10 times as hard -- and even then it takes much skill to paddle around the various taboos. But it is fun to see how far you can get in spite of being a woman.''         Mrs. Dulles was born in Watertown, N.Y., one of five children of a Presbyterian minister and his wife. One ancestor, John Welsh, served as envoy to Britain in Rutherford B. Hayes's Administration, and her grandfather John W. Foster and an uncle, Robert Lansing, each served as Secretary of State, under Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilson, respectively.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College with a major in social sciences, worked in refugee rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in France after World War I and returned to Bryn Mawr to earn a master's degree in labor and industrial economics.         She took odd jobs in the early 1920's -- running a punch press at the American Tube & Stamping Company in Bridgeport, Conn., and working as payroll clerk for a hair net company in Long Island City, Queens.         She also traveled extensively in Europe, studied at the London School of Economics, investigated industrial methods in 75 British firms and received a master's degree from Radcliffe College and a doctorate in economics from Harvard.         In the 1930's she studied and taught economics and finance in Paris, Geneva, Basel, Boston, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Bryn Mawr. She produced scholarly books including ''The French Franc, 1914-1928,'' ''The Facts and Their Interpretation'' and ''The Bank for International Settlements at Work.'' She wrote more than a dozen books in all.         When she was 30 she met David Simon Blondheim, a philologist who, as an Orthodox Jew, was not regarded by her family as marriage material, she indicated in her memoir. She married him anyway, in 1932. In 1934, not long before the birth of their son, Dr. Blondheim committed suicide.         Mrs. Dulles, who used her maiden surname, entered Government service in 1936 as director of financial research for the Social Security Board. In 1942 she moved on to the State Department. At the Bretton Woods international monetary conference in New Hampshire in 1944, she was a prominent member of the American delegation.         The next year, she went to Vienna as the State Department's financial attache. She demonstrated keen bargaining powers -- helping to feed starving Austrians by arranging the barter of horses for German cabbages and potatoes.         Later, as special assistant to the director of the State Department's office of German affairs, Mrs. Dulles was credited with ''working miracles,'' as one biographer put it. She helped to reduce West German unemployment and increase production.         To hasten those developments, she said, she would ''send requests from Berlin for money and rush back to Washington in time to compose favorable answers.'' She wangled more than $1 billion for West Berlin, adorning it with the now-famous Congress Hall, which Berliners for many years fondly referred to as the ''Dulleseum'' and ''Frau Dulles's Hut,'' as well as a hospital and educational centers.         Beginning in 1959, Mrs. Dulles was assigned to studying foreign aid programs and visited 60 countries on behalf of the State Department's office of intelligence and research.         She left the State Department in 1962, after her brother Allen had been dismissed from the C.I.A. in the wake of the Bay of Pigs catastrophe. Leonard Mosley wrote in his 1978 book ''Dulles'' that early in 1962, during the Kennedy Administration, Secretary of State Dean Rusk summoned her and said, ''The White House has asked me to get rid of you.''         Mrs. Dulles, in her memoirs, ''Eleanor Lansing Dulles: Chances of a Lifetime,'' published in 1980, wrote affectionately of her older brothers but did not hesitate to say that since childhood there were frictions among the siblings. She also admitted that her strong personality won her her share of enemies.         She suffered from poor eyesight since childhood and developed deafness but remained active well into her old age.         Her survivors include her son, David, of Washington, and her daughter, Ann Dulles Joor, of Manlius, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Eileen C. Dugan, a Brooklyn Democrat who was elected to her ninth term in the New York State Assembly only on Tuesday, died yesterday at Beth Israel Medical Center. Ms. Dugan, who lived in Carroll Gardens, was 51.         The cause was breast cancer, according to her family.         Gov. George E. Pataki, who served in the Assembly with Ms. Dugan, ordered state flags to be flown at half-staff in her memory.         Since 1991, Ms. Dugan, one of the principal political tacticians in the Assembly, had served as the chairwoman of the Democratic Assembly Campaign Committee, a major fund-raising and strategy-making arm of the party. This year, despite a determined Republican effort, Democrats won an additional seat in the Assembly and will hold 96 of its 150 seats when the new session begins in January.         Ms. Dugan, who won her most recent election with 70 percent of the vote as the candidate of the Democratic and Liberal parties, represented the 52d District, which includes not only Carroll Gardens, but also Bay Ridge, Cobble Hill, Red Hook, Sunset Park, Brooklyn Heights and Boerum Hill.         The district includes much of the Brooklyn waterfront in Red Hook, an area Ms. Dugan was dedicated to revitalizing through the establishment of open space and park land and the introduction of new business. She sponsored legislation that committed funds for studies to accomplish these ends.         At the time of her death, Ms. Dugan was chairwoman of the Assembly's Committee on Economic Development, Job Creation and Industry and a member of the Governmental Employees Committee, the Labor Committee, the Rules Committee and the Ways and Means Committee.         In 1985, five years after she was first elected to the Assembly, Ms. Dugan became the first female member of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, which writes the budget.         As chairwoman of the Committee on Economic Development, she was successful in establishing economic development zones in deteriorating neighborhoods.         As a member of the Subcommittee on Displaced Homemakers, she was active in the passage of legislation to commit funds for training divorced or battered women in marketable skills at centers throughout the state.         Ms. Dugan was born in Carroll Gardens and attended the Grace Institute in Manhattan. She began her career in government in 1974 as a special assistant to the New York City Comptroller .         She is survived by her sister, Patricia Curtin of Sound Beach, L.I., and two brothers, Brian, of Holbrook, L.I., and Brendan, of Brooklyn.       
         Peggy Wattles Pulleyn, whose grandchild's ill fortune moved her to found the Princeton Child Development Institute in 1970, died on Dec. 8 in a freakish accident near her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 85.         According to the Somerset County Prosecutor's office, she was walking on a road in Bedminster when a car driven by a longtime friend, Allison Ewing, backing up to meet her, lurched out of control and struck her. No charges were filed against Mrs. Ewing, 76, who is the wife of New Jersey's senior State Senator, John H. Ewing of Bernardsville.         The institute in Princeton, now caring for about 40 autistic children, has grown into a nationally recognized center that has served as a model elsewhere in the country. Its science-based program, backed by research and staff training, was recognized by the Federal Government in 1983 when it cited the Institute as one of 60 exemplary private schools in the country.         Mrs. Pulleyn felt the need for such a school in 1968 when her family realized that her first grandson, Rollie, was autistic, a still-enigmatic condition with many associated disorders. Her search for a suitable program for the child led her, her daughter and some other parents in the Princeton region to start their own school.         From modest beginnings with 17 children, the institute moved into its own home in Princeton, where a further addition was completed this year. Mrs. Pulleyn was an original board member.         She served as its longtime chairwoman, raising funds for the state-supported institute. Up to her death, she remained active on the board, and was also active in another project: the Magic Shop in Oldwick.         Founded just after World War II, it is a gift shop that initially assisted returning veterans. Since then, it has been a financial supporter of the nearby Bonnie Brae Home for Boys, a boarding institution that teaches troubled children academic subjects and trade skills.         Mrs. Pulleyn, an amateur artist, contributed her work and staffed the counter to sell the Magic Shop's wide variety of children's clothing and other handmade materials. The day before her death, she suited up the shop's Santa for the season.         Peggy Wattles grew up in Buffalo and graduated from Bennett Junior College in Millbrook, N.Y. She was an outstanding amateur golfer who won New York State championships in the 1930's and twice reached the quarterfinals of the United States Women's National Golf Tournament.         Mrs. Pulleyn's husband, Robert, a lawyer, died in 1990. She is survived by her daughter, Pamela Pulleyn Machold of Princeton; a brother, Gurdon W. Wattles of Oldwick; a sister, Elizabeth Wattles of Hightstown, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Barbara Yuncker, a prize-winning science reporter for The New York Post and a longtime leader of the Newspaper Guild, died yesterday. She was 74 and had homes in Manhattan and Canaan, N.Y.         The cause was breast cancer, said her sister, Betty Yuncker Lee.         Ms. Yuncker was twice winner of the prestigious Albert Lasker Award for science writing: in 1966, for a series on the birth-control pill, and in 1968, for a series on the human brain. In 1979, she won a Matrix leadership award from Women in Communications. In her career at The Post, from 1945 to 1986, she  also won local Newspaper Guild Page One and New York Newswomen's Club awards.         Ms. Yuncker, who was born in Greencastle, Ind., graduated from DePauw University in 1943. In 1943, she joined The Wall Street Journal, the first woman to be a copy editor there. She moved to the Post copy desk in 1946, and in 1959  became a science and medical reporter. Later, she was medicine-science editor.         She left newspapers for a year in 1956-57, when she was Deputy Commissioner of the State Commerce Department, writing reports for women working outside the  home.         She was elected guild unit chairwoman at The Post in 1976, while Dorothy Schiff was publisher. When Rupert Murdoch bought the paper in 1977, she became the first Murdoch employee to lead a bargaining committee against the publisher. In 1981, she became a member of the guild's international executive board.         She retired from The Post in 1986.         She is survived by her sister, of Boynton Beach, Fla., two nephews and a niece.       
         Barbara Jordan, the black Congresswoman and scholar who stirred the nation with her Churchillian denunciations of the Watergate abuses of President Richard M. Nixon, died today in her home state of Texas at the age of 59.         Afflicted with multiple sclerosis, Ms. Jordan died from viral pneumonia as a  complication of leukemia, according to officials of the University of Texas in Austin, where she taught.         Ms. Jordan, the first black elected to Congress from Texas after Reconstruction, retired from the House in 1979 after three terms to teach political ethics at the university's Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, never losing her potent talent for public speaking even from the confines of a wheelchair.         Most recently, her rich, impassioned voice was heard once more in Congress when, as chairwoman of the Commission on Immigration Reform, she spoke out last  year against a proposal to deny automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants born in this country. "To deny birthright citizenship would derail this engine of American liberty," she warned with the same eloquence that mesmerized her American audience on July 25, 1974, when Representative Jordan argued for the impeachment of President Nixon.         Ms. Jordan, whom her students recalled as never being without a copy of the Constitution in her purse, rooted that Watergate speech in her faith in the Constitution's promise and in her personal history as a child of the Jim Crow South.         "I felt somehow for many years that George Washington and Alexander Hamilton  just left me out by mistake," she declared, catching the nation's attention with measured, sepulchral oratory from her seat on the House Judiciary Committee. "But through the process of amendment, interpretation and court decision I have  finally been included in 'We, the people.' "         Then, with a smoldering glance across the proceedings of the historic Constitutional crisis, Ms. Jordan added, "My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total, and I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution."         Ms. Jordan was one of American politics' pioneer black women. In 1966, she was elected as the first black state Senator in Texas, and went on to be the first woman and first black elected to Congress from Texas. In 1976, she was the first black woman to deliver a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention, riveting her audience on national television as she spoke magisterially from the stage at New York's Madison Square Garden.         "All blacks are militant in their guts," she told an interviewer during her first Congressional campaign. "But militancy is expressed in different ways."         As a model of the Democratic politician from the New South, Ms. Jordan was less an angry or confrontational liberal than an imposing master of the process  and its details. A consummate politician from her earliest days in the Texas Legislature, Ms. Jordan won a seat on the House Judiciary Committee though only  a freshman by importuning her political mentor and friend, former President Lyndon B. Johnson, to pull some strings.         "She proved that black is beautiful before we knew what it meant," Mr. Johnson said of her. His widow, Lady Bird Johnson, led Texans in mourning their  native daughter. "I feel a stabbing sense of loss at the passing of a good friend," Mrs. Johnson said today.         Ms. Jordan's political prowess saw her ascend to the post of Speaker pro tem  in the Texas Senate six years after having arrived there as a political oddity and an outcast.         The youngest of three sisters, Barbara Charline Jordan was born on Feb. 21, 1936, into the poverty of Houston's Fourth Ward. She attended Houston's segregated public schools and graduated magna cum laude with debating honors from the all-black Texas Southern University. Her father, Benjamin, a Baptist minister, moonlighted as a warehouse clerk to help her pay for college, where her scholarship and assertiveness were honed.         As leader of the debating team, Ms. Jordan, known as B. J. to her friends, later proudly recalled maneuvering the Harvard team to a draw. "When an all-black team ties Harvard, it wins," she said.         Ms. Jordan received a law degree in 1959 from Boston University and was soon  at practice from her family's dining-room table. Eventually, she had a second-story office above a print shop near her family's simple frame house.         "I never wanted to be run of the mill," she told Molly Ivins, the Texas writer who was a friend since 1969 and likened interviewing Ms. Jordan to "a bit like grilling God" because of the care, scholarship and booming authority of her speech.         "We were poor," Ms. Jordan said of her strict but loving upbringing. "But so  was everyone around us, so we did not notice it."         When Miss Jordan was 11, she quit her piano lessons -- a defiant act that angered her father. He told her that the only good jobs for black women were in  teaching music or in performing, and asked her what she intended to do if she could not play the piano. "I don't know," she recalled telling him, "but I'll manage somehow."         As a Congressional newcomer, Ms. Jordan served notice that she had received 80 percent of the vote and would therefore have far broader interests than the Black Caucus agenda, and would hardly be a "female chauvinist."         "You know, Barbara wasn't really that concerned about the guilt or innocence  of Nixon," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat who served with Ms. Jordan on the impeachment hearings. "She was most concerned that the Constitution not be distorted for political reasons."         Some of Ms. Jordan's earliest politicking was as a young lawyer when she directed one of Houston's first voter drives in support of the Kennedy-Johnson ticket in 1960. She lost her first two bids for elective office in rough-and-tumble, racism-tinged bouts. But she succeeded when state legislative  districts were finally redrawn and she became the first black of either sex to be elected to the Texas Senate since 1883.         Even amid the political turmoil of 1974, when Congresswoman Jordan contended  that the Watergate conspirings had put the nation "on the edge of repression and tyranny," the outspoken Texan still led with her optimism. During that summer of the Watergate crisis, she took care to visit the graduates of Howard University  and urge them: "Reaffirm what ought to be. Get back to the truth; that's old, but get back to it. Get back to what's honest; tell government to do that. Affirm the civil liberties of the people of this country. Do that."         Ms. Jordan is survived by her mother, Arylenne; two sisters, Bennie Creswell  and Rose Mary McGowan, and a brother-in-law, John McGowan, all of Houston.       
         Pam Conrad, the author of "Prairie Songs," "Stonewords: A Ghost Story" and other works for children and young adults, died on Monday at her home in Rockville Center, L.I. She was 48.         The cause was breast cancer, said a spokeswoman at the Maria Carvainis literary agency.         Ms. Conrad was born in New York City. She graduated from the New School for  Social Research in 1984.         After writing "I Don't Live Here!" (1983), she won critical praise for "Prairie Songs" (1985), about a pioneer woman who goes mad after moving from New York to the plains of Nebraska.         Ms. Conrad explored sometimes disturbing themes for young readers in her fiction. Her novel "Our House: Stories of Levittown," was a finalist for the 1995 Newbery Medal. She wrote one novel for adults, "Pumpkin Moon" (1994).         She is survived by two daughters, Sarah, of Rockville Center, and Johanna, of Melbourne, Fla.; her parents, Robert and Doris Stampf of Lancaster, Pa.; two brothers, David, of Shoreham, L.I., and Jonathan, of North Valley Stream, L.I.,  and a sister, Melissa, of Ronkonkoma, L.I.       
         Suzanne Prou, a French novelist and militant opponent of anti-Semitism, died  in Paris, where she lived, during the night of Dec. 29-30. She was 75.         Le Monde reported her death on Tuesday, without giving its cause, and called  her "a novelist of bittersweet nostalgia."         Mrs. Prou (pronounced proo) wrote two dozen novels. The best known is "La Terrasse des Bernardini," or "The Bernardini Terrace," published in 1973. It won the Prix Renaudot, one of several French literary awards her works received.         Reviewing that book, William Cole wrote in the Saturday Review, "Madame Prou  weaves an incredibly fine net, the strands of which are passion, deceit, sadism, pride, seduction and burning hate." And the New Yorker said that she made "the charged atmosphere of decaying provincial life as fascinating as a drop of pond  water viewed through the lens of a microscope."         Her first novel, "Les Patapharis," which appeared in France in 1966 and was later published in English as "The Patapharis Affair," won the Prix Femina and was praised by Martin Levin in The New York Times Book Review as a "delicately shadowed work of art." Her last book, "L'Album de Famille," came out last year.         Mrs. Prou embraced a variety of causes during her life. During the German occupation of France she took a stand against anti-Semitism, helping to produce  an underground newspaper that denounced it. She was subsequently made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor.         Over the years, she was also an ardent feminist and supporter of human rights. In 1994, in a long program about AIDS that was broadcast on all French television channels, she gave a harrowing account of how her 26-year-old granddaughter, Erica, had died of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome the previous year.         The novelist was born Suzanne Doreau, the daughter of an army officer and a teacher, in a village near St.-Tropez on the French Riviera. She grew up partly  in Algeria and Indochina, pursued university studies in France -- in Marseilles  and Aix-en-Provence -- received a degree in literature in 1942 and was a schoolteacher for a time.         Her husband, Charles Prou, died earlier. They married in 1944 and had a daughter, Anne-Francoise.       
         Kathryn Marie Hemphill, a top golfer in the 1930's and 40's, died on Wednesday. She was 84.         Hemphill, who was born in Hattiesburg, Miss., and grew up in Columbia, reached the semifinals of the national amateur championship in 1936 and '37. The next year, she was selected for the United States Curtis Cup team. She won a point for the United States, which defeated Britain 5 1/2 to 3 1/2 in Manchester, Mass.         She turned professional in 1946 and moved to Greensboro, N.C. Four years later, she returned to Columbia and went to work for a bank, retiring in 1977.         She was a member of the Women's Golf Hall of Fame in Augusta, Ga.       
         Eleanor Clark, an author best known for the evocative range of her accounts of oystering in Brittany and of the streets of Rome, died on Friday at a retirement home in Boston. She was 82.         Miss Clark, the widow of Robert Penn Warren, was a master stylist whose works won critical acclaim and inspired a devoted private following. Her writings included reviews, essays, children's books and novels.         In a review in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard called a 1975 reissue of  her 1952 book "Rome and the Villa" "perhaps the finest book ever to be written about a city."         But the most telling tributes came from the generations of American and other tourists who followed her steps -- page by dogeared page -- through the city, marveling at each architectural feature that triggered her soaring ruminations on everything from ancient history and early Roman poetry to modern social conditions.         Although she was sometimes described as a travel writer, "Rome and a Villa" is not a traditional travel book. Nor is "The Oysters of Locmariaquer," a somewhat similar book that used oystering in Brittany as a springboard to an excursion through history and culture, and won the 1964 National Book Award for  arts and letters. Each reflected deep scholarship and a lively intuition.         Both in those books and in her norels, including "Baldur's Gate" (1970) and "Camping Out" (1986), Miss Clark seemed especially moved by landscape, an interest that was grounded in her childhood amid the rolling hills around Roxbury, Conn., her daughter, the poet Rosanna Clark, said yesterday.         Born in Los Angeles, Miss Clark was a descendant of early New England settlers. Her father was a mining engineer, and she seems to have inherited her  literary and scholarly bent from her mother, a Vassar graduate steeped in comparative literature.         Miss Clark also attended Vassar and spent much of her time during her college years on visits to Manhattan. She later became a conspicuous part of the city's  intellectual left, writing for The Partisan Review, The New Republic and The Nation. She was viewed as independent-minded with a youthful social conscience and regarded herself for a time as "a Trotskyite sympathizer."         During a trip to Mexico in 1937 she became a translator for Trotsky and was married to one of his secretaries for a brief time.         During World War II she worked for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, interviewing French and Italian diplomats. It was at a party at Katherine Anne Porter's home in the spring of 1944 that she met Mr. Warren, then in the last stages of an unhappy first marriage.         Although she recounted later that she had pursued him, once confiding that it had taken all her guile to get a simple good-night kiss, at the first meeting he seems to have been more taken with her than she with him.  She left the party with one of his friends, the poet Denis Devlin, and, as Mr. Warren later railed  in recounting the meeting to his children, "a bunch of other drunken Irishmen."         After their marriage in 1952, they traveled widely and found a formula for pursuing their separate literary careers. Working in different studies of the converted 17th-century barn that served as their home in Fairfield, Conn., they  wrote from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M. daily, she using the typewriter in the companionship of their cat, he writing in longhand accompanied by their dog.         When Miss Clark was stricken with macular degeneration and almost totally lost her eyesight (a setback described in "Eyes, Etc.," her 1977 memoir), her husband began reading to her at night. He died in 1989.         In addition to her daughter, of Needham, Mass., she is survived by a son, Gabriel, a sculptor, of Wood River Junction, R.I., and four grandchildren.
