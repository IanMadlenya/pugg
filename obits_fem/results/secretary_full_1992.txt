         Gretchen Householder Poston, the White House social secretary in the Carter Administration, died Monday at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 59 years old and lived in Washington.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Poston, who was born in Minneapolis, graduated from St. Mary's College in Leavenworth, Kan., and taught school for six years before moving to Washington, where she became involved in charitable fund raising and Democratic Party activities. She worked for the campaign of every Democratic Presidential nominee from 1964 on.         Mrs. Poston was a founder and co-owner of WashingtonInc., an events-planning company begun in 1967.         In January 1977, she was appointed the White House social secretary, a post in which she organized the visit of Pope John Paul II to the White House and state dinners celebrating the Panama Canal treaty, the Camp David accords and normalized relations with China.         Leaving the White House at the end of the Carter Administration, she returned to WashingtonInc. Among the events she organized there were a dinner for recipients of the Medal of Honor; a tribute to Adm. Hyman Rickover; celebrations marking the 25th anniversary of the National Endowment for the Humanities, the 75th anniversary of the Brookings Institution and the 20th anniversary of National Public Radio, and a dinner honoring the Polish leader Lech Walesa during his 1989 visit to the United States.         In 1990, Mrs. Poston helped establish the Washington Race for the Cure, a five-kilometer run that had been held annually in other cities to raise awareness about breast cancer prevention and to promote support for research to find a cure.         Surviving are her husband, Raymond L. Poston of Washington; four children, Jeffrey L., Carol D., Ramsey R. and Katharene J., all of Washington, and a sister, Diane J. Welch of Kansas City, Mo.       
         Marion F. Schappel, a retired vice president at Citibank and one of the first women there to reach that rank, died on Wednesday at her home in Somers, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of complications of cancer, her family said.         Miss Schappel was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Mahwah, N.J. She started at Citibank when she was 18, after graduation from high school. Her first job was as a page. She worked her way up to become secretary to a branch manager. After years of experience, she often found herself explaining procedures to younger male executive trainees.         In 1961 she was promoted to assistant manager, only the third woman in the bank's 151-year history to hold such a post. By 1964 there were a dozen female assistant managers and she was chosen from them to study at the Stonier Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University. She and 22 other students from other banks that year were the first women admitted at Stonier.         In 1965 she was one of four women promoted to assistant vice president at Citibank and in 1972 became a vice president. Most of her work was in branch banking. She spent 22 years in the branch at the bank's headquarters at 399 Park Avenue in Manhattan and became its manager. She was also manager of the branch in the Pan Am Building. She retired from full-time work in 1987 but continued as a consultant to the bank for three years.         Surviving are two brothers, Robert B. of Pasco, Wash., and Richard B. of Oak Ridge, Tenn.       
         Elizabeth Man Sarcka, a founder of Spring Lake Ranch in Vermont, one of the earliest halfway houses for the mentally ill, died on Sunday at Hampshire House, a community care home in East Montpelier, Vt. She was 98 years old and lived much of her life in Long Island City and Richmond Hill, Queens.         She died of a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Sarcka and her husband, Wayne, established Spring Lake Ranch at Cuttingsville, Vt., in 1932 for people with mental and emotional problems and ran it for 30 years. Their therapeutic approach, based on the participation of both staff members and residents in ranch affairs, attracted national attention.         Retiring to the island of Jamaica in 1961, the Sarckas organized a school for adults in the mountain community of Malvern. After her husband's death in 1969, Mrs. Sarcka returned to Queens.         Active in volunteer work at the United Nations, Mrs. Sarcka was president of the Queens Chapter of the United Nations Association from 1975 to 1979. She also served as executive secretary of the League of Nations Association of Greater New York from 1927 to 1928.         A graduate of Barnard College, she was honored with the distinguished alumna award in 1983 and the Barnard Medal of Distinction in 1985.         Born in New York City, she came from a prominent New York family. Her father, Alrick H. Man, a Wall Street lawyer, developed the community of Kew Gardens in Queens, on property that had been bought by her grandfather, Alban P. Man.         She is survived by her daughter, Anne of Montpelier, Vt.; a niece, Lucy Jinishian of Old Greenwich, Conn., and a nephew, Alrick Man 3d of South Londonderry, Vt.       
         Quaintance Eaton, a writer of books and articles on opera, died on Sunday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.         She died of complications of a stroke, said Bill Cunningham, a longtime friend.         Miss Eaton was born in Kansas City, Mo.,and became a devotee of opera long before moving to New York City in the 1920's. She frequently wrote on the subject for Musical America, eventually becoming an associate editor, and was a contributing editor to Opera News.         In 1957, her book "Opera Caravan," an anecdotal history of the Metropolitan Opera on tour, was praised by Howard Taubman, then chief music critic of The New York Times, as "both diverting and informative."         In the 1960's, she published two histories that have become standard works: "The Boston Opera Company" (1965) and "The Miracle of the Met" (1968). She was also executive secretary of the National Federation of Music Clubs and of the New York City Opera Guild.         Her last book, published in 1987, was "Sutherland and Bonynge: An Intimate Biography," about Dame Joan Sutherland and her husband, the conductor Richard Bonynge.         Miss Eaton was known among opera audiences for the chinchilla coat she wore and for her collection of stylish hats, said to number 250.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Melissa Stutsman Topping, an executive of the Henry Luce Foundation, died on Friday at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 49 years old and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.         She died of complications from cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Topping was the vice president and secretary of the Henry Luce Foundation in Manhattan and principal staff officer of its Clare Boothe Luce Fund. She administered $21 million in grants for scholarships, fellowships and professorships for women in science, to help remedy their under-representation in that field.         She was born in St. Louis and graduated from Vassar College in 1964. After working for a law firm and Citibank, she joined the foundation in 1969, where she progressed from research assistant to program associate, program officer, associate director and vice president.         Mrs. Topping was also a trustee of Pratt Institute, manager of the National Society of Colonial Dames in New York, an advisory council member of the New York Women's Foundation and a past board member of the Women's Prison Association and was also active in the Trust for Cultural Resources.         Surviving are her husband of 14 years, Henry J. Topping Jr., a private investor; her mother, Helen Eades Stutsman of St. Louis; a sister, Nancy Lamb of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, Albert C. Stutsman Jr. of St. Louis; and two stepchildren, Henry J. 4th, and Samantha S. Topping, both of Manhattan.       
         Jean Tilford Palmer, a former director of the Navy Waves and longtime administrator at Barnard College, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.         During World War II, Miss Palmer was a Wave captain, serving as women's reserve assistant to the Navy's director of enlisted personnel. She rose to the position of director of the Waves in 1945.         Upon leaving the Navy, Miss Palmer joined the staff of Barnard as director of admissions in 1946. Three years later, she was appointed general secretary, in charge of the college's development plan.         Remaining in this position for 23 years, Miss Palmer supervised all of the college's non-academic operations from admissions to fund-raising to the design of student dormitories.         Born in Omaha, Miss Palmer was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. Before enlisting in the Naval Reserve in 1942, she served as business manager of the Association of the Junior Leagues of America for 14 years.         For her wartime service, she was awarded a Commendation from the Secretary of the Navy in 1944 and the Legion of Merit in 1946.         She is survived by a brother, Morse Palmer of Delray Beach, Fla.       
         M. F. K. Fisher, the writer whose artful personal essays about food created a genre, died yesterday afternoon at her home on the Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, Calif. She was 83 years old.         She died after a lengthy battle with Parkinson's disease, her daughter Kennedy Wright said. "I think it was probably the effects of the disease coupled with the fact that she was 83 years old," Ms. Wright said.         In a career spanning more than 60 years, Mrs. Fisher wrote hundreds of stories for The New Yorker, as well as 15 books of essays and reminisences. She produced the enduring English translation of Brillat-Savarin's book "The Physiology of Taste," as well as a novel, a screenplay, a book for children and dozens of travelogues.         While other food writers limited their writing to the particulars of individual dishes or expositions of the details of cuisine, Mrs. Fisher used food as a cultural metaphor.         Her subject matter, she said in an interview in 1990, "caused serious writers and critics to dismiss me for many, many years. It was woman's stuff, a trifle." But she was not deterred. In 1943 she wrote in her book "The Gastronomical Me":         "People ask me: Why do you write about food, and eating and drinking? Why don't you write about the struggle for power and security, and about love, the way others do. They ask it accusingly, as if I were somehow gross, unfaithful to the honor of my craft.         "The easiest answer is to say that, like most humans, I am hungry. But there is more than that. It seems to me that our three basic needs, for food and security and love are so mixed and mingled and entwined that we cannot straightly think of one without the others. So it happens that when I write of hunger, I am really writing about love and the hunger for it, and warmth and the love of it and the hunger for it."         In 1963, W. H. Auden called her "America's greatest writer." In a review of "As They Were," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1982) for The New York Times Book Review, Raymond Sokolov wrote, "In a properly run culture, Mary Frances Kennedy Fisher would be recognized as one of the great writers this country has produced in this century."         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F. K.", an hourlong docummentary by a California filmmaker, Barbara Wornum, released in 1992, is a comprehensive view of Mrs. Fisher. Ms. Wornum followed Mrs. Fisher for four years, she said, because the single mother and writer "is the most poetic voice of the working woman in the 20th century."         Mrs. Fisher was the first child of Rex Kennedy, a small-town newspaper owner, and his wife, Edith. Mrs. Fisher wrote of her entrance into the world: "I began in Albion, Mich., and was born there on July 3, 1908, in a heat wave. I leapt forth only a few minutes before midnight, in a supreme effort from my mother, whose husband had assured her that I would be named Independencia if I arrived on the Fourth."         She had two younger sisters, Anne, who died in 1965, and Norah, and a brother, David, who died in 1942. Before she entered kindergarten, Mrs. Fisher's father purchased The Whittier News, a newspaper in Whittier, a predominently Quaker town near Los Angeles, where the Kennedy clan grew up "on the outside looking in," she said.  She was an Episcopalian, and, she said, she was never invited to the home of a Quaker.         "Episcopalians were the third world in Whittier," she said in a recent interview. "I wrote a book about my childhood, and I wanted to call it 'Child of an Inner Ghetto.' " Lessons From the Family Cook         Instead, the book, which was published in 1970, was called "Among Friends." On its cover, a sepia-toned family photograph shows Edith Kennedy, tall, hatted and veiled, looking into the distance, her arm protecting a pouting Anne. Mary Frances stood alone, biting her full, lower lip, staring at the camera. "I was a haughty child," she told an interviewer.         She was removed enough to become a keen observer, and her sharp blue eyes remained pinned on significant moments of communion. She described herself, a well-loved little girl, by depicting a meal that her mother once served: "deep rich, floating puddles of hot cocoa for supper, with buttered toast sogging deliciously in them."         Her tastes and her eye for nuance continued to sharpen through adolescence. Apprenticing with the family cook, she became accomplished in the kitchen.         She also became, she said, "an insatiable reader and scribbler." After brief sojourns at Illinois College, Whittier College, Occidental College and the University of California at Los Angeles, she married a doctoral student, Alfred Fisher, in 1929 and moved to Dijon, France, where he would complete his doctorate in literature.         A beauty and an enchantress, Mrs. Fisher was photographed by Man Ray, but by her own lights, she said, "I wasn't so pretty that I didn't have to do something else." She said she "spent hours in my kitchen cooking for people, trying to blast their safe, tidy little lives with a tureen of hot borscht and some garlic-toast and salad, instead of the fruit cocktail, fish, meat, vegetable, salad, dessert and coffee they tuck daintily away seven times a week."         Her writing had the same ornery passion, the same impetuous urge to soothe her readers, while shaking their souls. Her first book, "Serve it Forth," published by Harper Brothers in 1937, took America by the shoulders and said, "Look, if you have to eat to live, you may was well enjoy it." The theme was repeated in "Consider the Oyster," which was published by Duell, Sloan & Pearce in 1941. Food Sensual and Practical         Her ebullient embrace of the slow, sensual pleasures of the table was matched by her cool acceptance of sudden violence and evil. In a 1942 review of "How to Cook a Wolf," in The New York Herald Tribune, Lewis Gannett wrote that anyone familiar with the writer's earlier work "will recall the faintly Gothic perversity that makes Mrs. Fisher's literature unique."         Mrs. Fisher, on the other hand, saw herself as practical. In "How to Cook a Wolf," for instance, she suggested that when the wolf is at the door, one should invite him and have him for dinner.         In 1943, she published "The Gastronomical Me," (Duell, Sloan & Pearce) followed by "Here Let Us Feast (Viking) in 1946. Her novel, "Not Now But Now," was published by Viking in 1947. Her translation from French of "The Physiology of Taste" was published in 1949, the same year that "An Alphabet for Gourmets" appeared.         "A Cordiall Water," a slender volume of folk cures, was published by Little, Brown in 1961. Three years later, the same publisher brought out "A Map of Another Town," a reminiscence of the years she spent in Aix-en-Provence. In 1968, Putnam published "With Bold Knife and Fork," and Mrs. Fisher joined Julia Child and Michael Field as consultants to the Time-Life book "The Cooking of Provencal France."         Throughout these decades, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters. Her marriage to Mr. Fisher ended in divorce in 1937 and that same year she married the painter Dilwyn Parrish, who died after a lingering illness in 1941. Her daughter, Anna, was born in 1943 and in 1945, she married Donald Friede, a literary agent. Her second daughter, Kennedy, was born in 1946, and she divorced Mr. Fried two years later. An Appetite for Writing         In 1952, Mrs. Fisher and her sister, Norah, rented houses on neighboring vineyards in St. Helena, Calif., an area that, with the exceptions of stays in the South of France, would remain home.         In 1971, she moved to Bouverie Ranch in Glen Ellen, where her house of two sprawling rooms became a salon for visiting writers and food worshipers. She made her final trip to Europe in 1978, writing about Marseilles in "A Considerable Town," published that year by Viking.         Since then, Mrs. Fisher has worked and entertained at Bouverie Ranch. "My life is simple," she said in an interview several years ago. "When I can't write, I read. When I can't read I cook."         Bedridden in recent years, she cooked less and less. But she continued to write. "Sister Age," was published by Alfred A. Knopf in 1983. Northpoint Press (which released new editions of many of her earlier books), published "Dubious Honors," a collection of introductions that Mrs. Fisher wrote for others' books. "The Boss Dog," a book for children, was published by Northpoint in 1991.         In an interview in 1991 she said: "I've lost my appetite. But my mind and heart have never been clearer."         Plagued by diminishing sight and crippling arthritis, her voice reduced to a whisper by Parkinson's disease, she spoke of waking up before 4 A.M. and writing stories in her mind for the hours before her secretary came in to take dictation. According to her agent, Robert Lescher, the writer "has been working on a number of manuscripts which will be published posthumously."         "The purpose of living is to get old enough to have something to say," she said last year. "But by that time, your voice doesn't work and your hands won't obey you so it's tough as hell to find a way to say it all."         Mrs. Fisher is survived by her sister, Norah Barr; two daughters, Anna Parrish, of Portland, Ore., and Ms. Wright of Alameda, Calif., and four grandchildren.

'On the Outside Looking In'         Mrs. Fisher's work has been steadily re-collected and re-released and her books sell briskly. "M. F.

Indeed, his chance to live at all is slim, and if he should survive the arrows of his own outrageous fortune and in the two weeks of his carefree youth find a clean smooth place to fix on, the years afterwards are full of stress, passion and danger. . . ."         "Men have enjoyed eating oysters since they were not much more than monkeys, according to the kitchen middens they have left behind them. And thus, in their own one-minded way, they have spent time and thought and money on the problems of how to protect oysters from the suckers and the borers and the starvers, until now it is comparatively easy to eat this two-valved mollusk anywhere, without thought of the dangers it has run in its few years. Its chilly delicate gray body slips into a stew-pan or under a broiler or alive down a red throat, and it is done. Its life has been thoughtless but no less full of danger, and now that it is over we are perhaps the better for it."

In "An Alphabet for Gourmets," (Viking, 1949), she wrote: "A complete lack of caution is perhaps one of the true signs of a real gourmet: he has no need for it, being filled as he is with a God-given and intelligently self-cultivated sense of gastronomical freedom. He not only knows from everything admirable he has read that he will not like Irish whisky with pineapple chilled in honey and vermouth, or a vintage Chambertin with poached lake perch; but every taste bud on both his actual and his spiritual palate wilts in revulsion at such thoughts. He does not serve these or similar combinations, not because he has been         told         , but because he         knows         ."         Throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, the peripatetic writer and cook lived in California, Switzerland and France, weathered three marriages and reared two daughters.

A Delicious Meal Of a Bookish Kind         Here are nine of the better-known books written by M.F.K. Fisher over the course of six decades. She wrote a total of 15.

         Tiki Freeman, who in the early 1970's became one of the first female cantors in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Eastchester, N.Y. She was 69 years old.         Mrs. Freeman died of cancer, said her husband, Joel.         Mrs. Freeman was born in Brooklyn, to Elias Gilner, one of the founders of the Haganah, the defense force raised by Palestinian Jews during the British Mandate, and Violet Sandheim, who had been private secretary to Henrietta Szold, the founder of Hadassah, the women's Zionist and charitable organization.         Mrs. Freeman's family emigrated to Palestine in the mid-1930's, returning in 1941 as war began to sweep over the area.         Mrs. Freeman graduated from Brooklyn College in 1947. While raising a family, she built a singing career and her repertory ranged from operettas of Gilbert & Sullivan to folk songs and religious music. She was also a stage manager for many productions of Gilbert & Sullivan and other light operas for the Westchester Music Conservatory Opera Company.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Freeman is survived by a daughter, Gail Weed Westcott, of Simsbury, Conn.; two sons, Jonathan, of Yonkers, and Ethan, of London and Vienna; a brother, Rabbi Herbert Gilner of Chambersburg, Pa., and two grandchildren.       
         Helen M. Knubel, archivist of the Lutheran Church, died on Thursday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91 years old. She lived in New Rochelle, N.Y., until she recently entered the Wartburg Nursing Home, in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         Miss Knubel died of respiratory failure, said her nephew, Frederick H. Knubel.         Miss Knubel was considered the foremost archivist of the history of the Lutheran Church in North America. She helped to gather and maintain records of the earliest settlements of Lutherans in the United States and Canada and organized the library and archives of the National Lutheran Council, which coordinated the service work of more than 30 Lutheran groups.         From 1954 to 1966 she was secretary of research and statistics of the National Lutheran Council. From 1967 to her retirement in 1971, she was associate director of the Office of Research, Statistics and Archives to the council's successor, the Lutheran Council in the U.S.A. She also founded and directed the Oral History of Cooperative Lutheranism in America.         Miss Knubel was born in New York City. Her father, Frederick H. Knubel, was president of the United Church in America, from its founding in 1918 to 1944. Her brother, Frederick R. Knubel, was president of the United Lutheran Synod of New York and New England from 1945 to 1957.         Miss Knubel's formal schooling was interrupted at age 15, when she was struck by polio, which forced her to use a wheelchair for the rest of her life. She studied at the New School for Social Research; the Biblical Seminary of New York, the predecessor to the New York Theological Seminary, and the Columbia University School of Library Service.         Among many honors, Miss Knubel was awarded the Distinguished Disciple Award of the Metropolitan New York Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.         In addition to her nephew, Frederick H. Knubel, of Manhattan, she is survived by a niece, Helen Perry, of Milford, N.J.       
         Katharine Bradley Lenhart, a volunteer active for decades in civic and social causes, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan and Waterford, Conn.         Her family said she died after a brief illness.         Born in Nyack, N.Y., Mrs. Lenhart graduated from Vassar College and studied at the Art Students League of New York and the Bank Street College of Education. She worked as a decorator before becoming executive secretary of the Spence School.         Mrs. Lenhart had been active in charities that included the American Red Cross, Bellevue Hospital and the Child Care Volunteers of New York. She was a benefactor and past president of the former Masters Nursery.         Mrs. Lenhart was involved in rehabilitating deserted buildings and transforming vacant lots into pocket parks or gardens in the South Bronx, an experience she turned into a play, "The Greening of Rosita." She was a founding director of West Farms Land Trust in Waterford and sat on the boards of the Hudson River Conservation Society and the Tappan Zee Historical Society.         Mrs. Lenhart is survived by three sisters, Helen B. Buckland of Farmington, Conn., and Mary B. Blake and Elizabeth B. Brookfield, of Nyack, and a brother, Dr. E. Tremain Bradley of Norfolk, Conn.       
         Jean Baer Fensterheim, a writer of personal self-help books and magazine articles aimed especially at women, died on Wednesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Herbert Fensterheim.         A native of Chicago and a 1944 graduate of Cornell University, Ms. Baer scored her first success as an author in 1965 when Macmillan began "Follow Me!," a travel guide for single women looking for a husband abroad. At the time, she was single and the publicity director for Seventeen magazine. The book grew from her experiences during more than a dozen trips to Europe, Latin America and other parts of the world.         This was followed in 1968 by "The Single Girl Goes to Town" (Macmillan). Months after its publication, she married Dr. Fensterheim, a clinical psychologist who also became her co-author. Together, they focused on psychological writings.         Their latest book was "Making Life Right When It Feels All Wrong" (Macmillan, 1988).         Outside the genre, Ms. Baer wrote "The Self-Chosen" (Arbor House, 1982), a book about what she called "the world of the Jewish elite" in the United States since World War II.         She was the secretary of the Overseas Press Club and served on its board of directors.         Ms. Baer is survived, in addition to Dr. Fensterheim, by a sister, Carol Norr of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a brother, Robert Baer of Woodstock, N.Y.       
         Alice Bennett Dunnington, a Government intelligence official during World War II, died on Monday at Beaumont at Bryn Mawr, a retirement home in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 87 years old.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Rodger McKinney, director of the Chadwick Funeral Home in Ardmore, Pa.         During the war years Mrs. Dunnington, a 1925 graduate of Smith College, was a policy planner for the Office of Strategic Services, precursor to the Central Intelligence Agency. As secretary to the service's policy planning committee, she reported to Col. Edward Buxton, Deputy Director of the O.S.S.         Mrs. Dunnington's husband, Walter, died in 1971. She is survived by three daughters, Michelle Osborn of Haverford, Pa., and Washington, Patricia Pynchon of New York and Alexandra Whalen Sears of Lima, Peru; a stepson, Walter G. Dunnington Jr. of New York and Gladstone, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Allen D. Ohstrom of The Plains, Va.; eight grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.         Correction:  July 10, 1992, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Alice Bennett Dunnington, a Government intelligence officer in World War II, identified a daughter incorrectly. She is Alexandra Whelen Sears of Lima, Peru.       
         Florence Flast, the chairwoman of the New York Committee on Public Education and Religious Liberty, died on Saturday at her home in Novato, Calif. She was 71 years old and also had a home in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Blanche Lewis, the treasurer of the committee, which is known as Pearl, of which Mrs. Flast was a national vice president.         She was a principal in a suit -- Flast v. Gardner -- in the United States Supreme Court that gave individual taxpayers the right to go to Federal court to challenge laws that, in their opinion, provide public funds for non-public schools. Mrs. Flast was one of seven taxpayers who sued John W. Gardner, then the Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, to establish that principle under the doctrine of separation of church and state.         The plaintiffs contended that H.E.W. was violating the Constitution by disbursing tax money to benefit private and parochial schools. The Supreme Court agreed to hear arguments in the case in 1967 after a lower court held that the plaintiffs had no standing to sue because the amounts of their taxes involved were negligible. Other Taxpayer Suits         The Court's ruling in 1968 came in an 8-to-1 decision, and other taxpayer suits have followed in which plaintiffs challenged acts of Congress.         When she went to court, Mrs. Flast was the president of the United Parents Associations of New York City, an umbrella group of parent and parent-teacher organizations representing the parents of more than 250,000 public-school pupils.         She also served as an officer of the Community Service Society, one of the city's oldest and most prestigious civic organizations.         Born and raised on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, Mrs. Flast graduated from Hunter College, and was elected to the Hunter Hall of Fame in 1975. She received an Americans United Award in 1969 for serving the cause of public education and church-state separation.         She is survived by her husband, Howard; two sons, Robert, of Westfield, N.J., and Barry, of Novato; a brother, Arnold Fassler of Williamsville, Vt.; a sister, Sue Kellerman of San Rafael, Calif., and three grandchildren       
         Helen Del Monte, the fiction editor of McCall's magazine from 1969 to 1990, died Aug. 21 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Del Monte died of cancer, said her husband, Roy.         A native of Los Angeles, Calif., Mrs. Del Monte graduated from Reed College in Portland, Ore., in 1952 and moved to New York City, where she soon took a job as a secretary at McCall's. She worked there until her retirement in 1990, advancing from secretary to editorial assistant to editor to fiction editor.         During her early career, Mrs. Del Monte worked with such writers as Ben Hecht, John Steinbeck, William Saroyan and Irwin Shaw. She also edited the fiction of newer writers like Alice Adams, Margery Finn Brown, Ron Carlson and Nora Johnson. She was widely considered an editor of great sensitivity and insight, said Roberta Silman, one of the many writers whose work appeared in McCall's during Mrs. Del Monte's tenure.         Mrs. Del Monte is survived by her husband.       
         Alison L. Gertz, who contracted AIDS in a single encounter with a man at the age of 16 and drew international attention by telling her story as a warning to heterosexuals, women and teen-agers, died yesterday afternoon at her family's summer home in Westhampton Beach, L.I.         She was 26 years old and lived in Manhattan. Her parents, Jerrold and Carol Gertz, said she died of AIDS.         When Ms. Gertz first publicly told her story, in an interview with The New York Times in 1989, the AIDS epidemic was widely perceived as confined to homosexual men, intravenous drug abusers and blood-transfusion recipients.         She fit none of those categories. Her story was all the more dramatic because of the privilege she was born into, with artistic talent, affluence, private schools and social prominence. Public Crusader         Ms. Gertz became a crusader, speaking at schools, colleges and public events. She appeared on the cover of People magazine, Esquire named her woman of the year and her story was printed overseas.         Her many television appearances included "20/20," "Good Morning America," "Sally Jessy Raphael" and "Joan Rivers." Some celebrity interviewers became concerned friends. A film she recorded for the World Health Organization was first shown at the United Nations on World AIDS Day in 1989 and has since been shown internationally.         Molly Ringwald portrayed her in "Something to Live For: The Alison Gertz Story," a two-hour ABC network special that was broadcast on March 29. It prompted 189,251 calls to the Federal AIDS telephone line in 24 hours, a record. A majority of the calls were from women.         Dr. Mathilde Krim, co-founder of the American Foundation for AIDS Research, called her a pioneer in educating middle-class heterosexuals.         Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services, has praised the ABC movie and said Ms. Gertz delivered "a powerful message to all Americans about the realities of AIDS." Hopes Suddenly Dimmed         An only child, Ms. Gertz was born in Manhattan and grew up on Park Avenue. Her father, the grandson of a founder of Gertz department stores, is a real-estate investor. Her mother cofounded a national chain of fashion stores, Tennis Lady.         Educated at Horace Mann School, Ms. Gertz studied art at Parsons School of Design. At 22, she was beginning a career as an illustrator.         "I was just, as they say, starting out in life," she said, with hopes of marriage and children.         But she began suffering puzzling ailments that eluded treatment. Finally, in 1988, she checked into Lenox Hill Hospital for tests. The ultimate diagnosis was AIDS.         The mystery of how she had become infected remained; her boyfriend at the time and a previous one tested negative. Eventually she looked up an old friend with whom she spent one romantic evening six years earlier, when AIDS was virtually unknown. He, it turned out, was bisexual and had since died of AIDS.         With medication, Ms. Gertz recovered from her initial illness and started on her mission.         "Unfortunately, a lot of people just flip by" AIDS reports about gay men and addicts, she said. "They think it doesn't apply to them. They can't turn the page on me. I could be one of them, or their daughter, and they have to deal with this." Encouraged Others         She received thousands of letters from around the world. She encouraged others who made their cases public, including Elizabeth Glaser, the wife of a television actor, who addressed the Democratic National Convention, and Mary Fisher, a former aide to President Gerald R. Ford who will speak to the Republican convention.         Friends of the Gertz family founded Concerned Parents for AIDS Research and have raised more than $1 million, and Ms. Gertz's friends hope to carry out her idea for an AIDS care program named Love Heals.         She is survived by her parents, who live in Manhattan.       
         Hope Yandell Hanes, who bred and raced champion horses, died yesterday at her home in Millbrook, N.Y. She was 86 years old.         She died of multiple ailments, her family said.         Mrs. Hanes started racing horses in the 1930's. Her husband, John Wesley Hanes Sr., joined in the venture, and they owned many stakes winners in England, Ireland and the United States. They were involved in the syndication of Nashua, Royal Charger and My Babu.         She was also a patron of the Metropolitan Opera and was an amateur painter, sculptor and writer.         Born in Danville, Ky., Mrs. Hanes grew up there and in Greenwich, Conn. She was educated at Bryn Mawr College, where she formed a lifelong friendship with her roommate, Katharine Hepburn.         She was married for 55 years to Mr. Hanes, who died in 1987. He was an Under Secretary of the Treasury in the Roosevelt Administration, the head of the New York Racing Association and a part owner in the company that made Hanes hosiery and underwear.         Mrs. Hanes is survived by their daughter, Susan H. Caldwell of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, June H. McKnight of Norwich, Vt., and Ormsby H. Matthiessen of Old Lyme, Conn.; a stepson, John W. Hanes Jr. of Alexandria, Va.; a brother, Lunsford P. Yandell of Scottsdale, Ariz.; 16 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Clara Rotter, for many years secretary of The New York Times drama department and a well-known figure in Broadway circles, died on Sunday at her home in Woodside, Queens. She was 82 years old.         She died after a long illness, said her brother Alex, of Queens.         Miss Rotter served as the conduit between the newspaper's critics and those involved in productions. Producers, writers, directors and, of course, press agents knew her well. They also knew her role as intermediary between them and the critics, whom she shielded, as they wanted, from pleadings and promotions. Such was her reputation that a question once put to applicants who wanted to join the theater press agents' union was "Who is Clara Rotter?"         Though frail and diminutive, Miss Rotter had a strong will and a determination to accomplish any chore to ease the paths of critics and reporters.         Brooks Atkinson, the Times drama critic when she came to the department, once sent off a letter and then remarked that he wished he hadn't written it. Miss Rotter worked her way by telephone through the post office hierarchy and was assured that retrieval was impossible. She persisted and learned the home telephone number of the top man. When she called, she was told he was dining at a restaurant. She telephoned him there and, according to colleagues at The Times, the letter was withdrawn. A Friend of the Famous         During her time in the drama department, which began shortly after she joined The Times in 1945, Miss Rotter made many friendships with the famous on Broadway and its auxiliary fields. Her correspondence with the playwright Sean O'Casey resulted in a flood of letters that in themselves constituted a literary legacy now included in the Billy Rose Theater Collection of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts.         During most of her secretarial career, Miss Rotter worked with Mr. Atkinson. When he died in 1984 after retiring from The Times in 1965, he left her $2,500, which she donated to the Brooks Atkinson Memorial Playwright Exchange of New Dramatists to assist talented young playwrights.         Miss Rotter served with several later critics before retiring at the age of 70. For several years she continued to act as liaison in the purchase of theater tickets for the parent New York Times Company.         In addition to her brother Alex, she is survived by another brother, Leonard, of Syosset, L.I.       
         Sayedah Khadijah Faisal, a founder of Brooklyn's first mosque who was known to hundreds of Muslims as Mother Khadijah, died Saturday at her home at the mosque in Brooklyn Heights. She was 93 years old.         Officials of the mosque, the Islamic Mission of America, said she died after a long illness, which they did not specify.         Mother Khadijah founded the mosque in 1939 with her husband, Sheik Daoud Ahmed Faisal, who served as its imam, or spiritual leader, until his death in 1980.         She and her husband worked to bring immigrant Muslims and new American converts to the faith together in one mosque. The success of their effort was evident at her funeral there yesterday, where Muslims from Pakistan and Morocco prayed shoulder to shoulder with American black converts. The mosque is situated in a former mansion at 143 State Street in Brooklyn Heights.         During noon prayers that preceded the funeral, which was attended by several hundred people, the plain pine coffin was kept in the rear of the mosque amid a large group of women who had come to mourn. Afterward, the men of the mosque brought the casket forward for a brief service in Arabic that was centered on the belief that the deceased was merely passing on to another life.         Belquis Abdur Raheem, a teacher at an Islamic elementary school, brought seven of her pupils to the funeral. "It is important for them to see an important part of Islamic history pass on," she said. "All of these children and their parents grew up with Mother Khadijah being known to them as a focal point of Islam."         In addition to being a founder of the mosque, Mother Khadijah served as its secretary and treasurer and led its Muslim Ladies Cultural Society.         For many years, the mosque was the only one in Brooklyn and, as a result, her leadership was broader than Brooklyn Heights. She also traveled around the country with her husband, addressing women's groups on Islam.         Mother Khadijah, who was born in Bermuda, is survived by her second husband, Imam Omar Bey, and by several nieces and nephews in Bermuda.       
         Shirley Booth, an actress whose warmth and versatility brought her acclaim on stage, screen and television, died on Friday at her home in North Chatham, Mass. She was 94 years old.         She died after a brief illness, said David Hunt of the Nickerson Funeral Home in Chatham, who announced her death yesterday.         Miss Booth was celebrated for never giving a bad performance. She portrayed many quick-witted women with acerbic tongues, but gained her greatest recognition for playing an ingratiating but drab, garrulous housewife clinging to wistful illusions in "Come Back, Little Sheba."         In "Sheba," she captivated audiences as Lola Delaney opposite Sidney Blackmer in William Inge's 1950 Broadway play, and then co-starred with Burt Lancaster in the 1952 movie version. Miss Booth's portrayals of a woman struggling to cope with her husband's alcoholism and their barren life together garnered every dramatic award, including a Tony and an Oscar.  'I Like My Work'         In a lighter vein, on television, the actress played the title role of an irrepressible maid on "Hazel" from 1961 to 1966, for which she received two Emmys. When associates deplored her doing the sitcom as demeaning her talents, she gently took issue with them. "Why not enjoy Hazel's success?" she said to a colleague. "I'm as pleased as I can be. I like my work."         She said the only other work she might enjoy as much as acting was interior decorating. For many years, she enjoyed remodeling her Manhattan apartment and 1810 cottage in Cape Cod, Mass.         In 1973, Miss Booth starred in a second television sitcom as a perky widow in "A Touch of Grace." Thirty years earlier, on radio, she had been a wisecracking cashier, Miss Duffy, on "Duffy's Tavern."  In Praise of Talents         She learned her craft by performing in 600 plays in stock companies before she appeared in some 40 plays on Broadway and in a few movies. On the stage she was a gangster's moll in "Three Men on a Horse" (1935), an inquisitive photographer in "The Philadelphia Story" (1939), a caustic writer in "My Sister Eileen" (1940), an anti-fascist teacher in "Tomorrow the World" (1943) and an exuberant gossip columnist in "Hollywood Pinafore" (1945).         Also on Broadway, Miss Booth was an urbane secretary in "Goodbye My Fancy" (1948), a freewheeling aunt in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" (1951), a romantic tourist in "The Time of the Cuckoo" (1952) and an ingratiating researcher in "The Desk Set" (1955).         Her films included "About Mrs. Leslie" (1954), "Hot Spell" (1958) and Thornton Wilder's "Matchmaker" (1958).         In comedies and musicals as well as dramas, reviews of her performances resembled love letters. The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson, reviewing a 1954 Broadway musical, "By the Beautiful Sea," wrote that Miss Booth's acting "radiates all through a large theater and draws an audience close together."         "The stage begins to glow the moment she steps on it and the audience melts, like a crowd of children whose imagination has been captured by someone they trust," he continued. "No one else in the theater has made native decency so human, so triumphant and so captivating."         The actress was born in Manhattan to the former Virginia Wright and Albert J. Ford, a business executive. The young Thelma Booth Ford attended public schools in Brooklyn and Hartford, and dropped out at 14 to seek a stage career, despite angry opposition by her father.         She made her first professional appearance in 1921 in Hartford in a thriller, "The Cat and the Canary," and appeared in stock theater in New Haven for more than a year, under the name Shirley Booth. She made her Broadway debut in "Hell's Bells" in 1925, along with another newcomer, Humphrey Bogart, and then interspersed stock engagements with short-lived Broadway plays for a decade.  For Room and Breakfast         She gained notice in New York by appearing in skits by Dorothy Parker at the Barbizon-Plaza Hotel in return for a room and breakfast. The performances led George Abbott, the producer and playwright, to give her the ingenue's role in "Three Men on a Horse." The comedy's two-year run elevated her from stock and led Mr. Abbott to remark, "I have worked with more actresses than I can count, and to me Shirley is easily tops."         Appraising her own views on acting, Miss Booth said: "I'm lucky. I play characters, not types. I don't care what the part is as long as it's a person I'm interested in, someone I want to introduce to people."         In an interview in 1971, she said: "I'd rather have affection than admiration. Affection is warmer and it lasts longer. I love a good critic. I don't care if he pans me, if he does it elegantly."         Miss Booth was married to Ed Gardner, the Archie of "Duffy's Tavern," from 1929 until their divorce in 1942. Her second husband, William H. Baker Jr., an artist and farmer, died of heart disease in 1951.         She is survived by a sister, Jean Coe of Los Angeles.       
         Dorothy Kirsten, an American lyric soprano who sang leading roles at the Metropolitan Opera for 30 years and was particularly renowned for her performances of Puccini heroines, died yesterday morning at the U.C.L.A. Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         She died of complications from a stroke she suffered on Nov. 5, said Peter Gravina, her longtime press representative.         At the height of her career, in the 1950's and 60's, Miss Kirsten appealed not only to opera fans, who knew her as an attractive, intelligent, thoroughly musical singer and a fine actress, but also to a broader public that knew her from her frequent radio and television appearances or from her performances in the films "The Great Caruso," with Mario Lanza, and "Mr. Music," with Bing Crosby.         On the opera stage, her repertory ran from staples like Mimi in Puccini's "Boheme" to comparative rarities like the title role in Charpentier's "Louise." In her concert and television appearances, she sang not only opera arias but theater and popular songs as well, and she co-starred with Frank Sinatra on the radio show "Your Hit Parade." Musical Heritage         Miss Kirsten was born into a musical family in Montclair, N.J., on July 6, 1910 (although she gave her birth year variously as 1917 and 1915). Her mother was an organist and music teacher. Her great-aunt, Catherine Hayes, had an operatic career and was known as "The Irish Jenny Lind." Her grandfather was a conductor and an early president of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians.         She was drawn to music and acting early in life, but did not set her sights on an operatic career until she had achieved some modest success as a popular singer. After leaving high school when she was 16 years old, Miss Kirsten worked as a demonstrator of Singer sewing machines and as what she called a trouble-shooter at New Jersey Telephone, while studying voice in New York City at night. When she had made some progress and wanted more frequent lessons than she could afford, she agreed to work for her teacher, Louis Darnay, as both secretary and maid in exchange for lessons.         By 1937, she was singing professionally on radio, both as a member of the Kate Smith Chorus and in her own solo spots with several dance orchestras. The soprano Grace Moore heard her in 1938 and became her mentor and benefactor, sending her to Rome for a year of study with Astolfo Pescia, who was Beniamino Gigli's vocal coach. She had planned to spend a second year in Italy and then a year in France, but returned to New York at the start of World War II.         Upon her return in 1939, Miss Kirsten made her professional concert debut in a stage show at the New York World's Fair. She was also reunited with Miss Moore, who recommended her to the Chicago Grand Opera, where Miss Kirsten made her operatic debut as Pousette in Massenet's "Manon" in 1940. Miss Kirsten sang 15 minor roles during her first season and the following year shared the stage with Miss Moore in a Chicago performance of "La Boheme," singing Musetta to Miss Moore's Mimi.         In 1942, Miss Kirsten began to sing leading roles with the San Carlo Opera Company, in Washington and New York City. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1943, and by 1945 had performed with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic and other major orchestras. Starting in September 1943, she had her own radio program, "Keepsakes," which ran for a year.         Miss Kirsten's Metropolitan Opera debut, as Mimi in "La Boheme" on Dec. 1, 1945, was a critical success, and was the start of a 30-year association with the house. In 1971, when she celebrated her 25th anniversary with the company, she reminisced about that debut, and recalled that Miss Moore sat in the first box, at the side of the stage, and threw roses to her. When Miss Moore died in a plane crash in Denmark in 1947, Miss Kirsten sang Schubert's "Ave Maria" at her funeral.         Miss Kirsten's career was centered in the United States, but she did tour Europe and, in 1962, the Soviet Union. There, besides giving recitals, she sang Violetta in a Bolshoi Opera performance of "La Traviata," to considerable acclaim, even though, as she said later, she had to go on without the benefit of a stage rehearsal. Worked With Composers         During her years at the Met, Miss Kirsten sang most of the important Puccini roles, including the title roles in "Manon Lescaut," "Tosca" and "Madama Butterfly," and she starred as Minnie in a revival of "La Fanciulla del West" that helped restore the work to the repertory. She prepared for the title role in "Louise" by going to France to study it with the composer. She also worked with the composer Italo Montemezzi on "L'Amore dei Tre Re" before she performed it in San Francisco and at the Met.         In addition to the Puccini heroines, her repertory included the female leads in Gounod's "Romeo et Juliette" and "Faust," Leoncavallo's "Pagliacci" and Verdi's "Traviata." She sang in the American premieres of Walton's "Troilus and Cressida" and Poulenc's "Dialogue des Carmelites," both in San Francisco.         Miss Kirsten's voice was not huge, but she used it gracefully throughout her long career. When she gave her farewell performance at the Met, on Dec. 31, 1976, Allen Hughes wrote in The New York Times that "she sang and acted the part of Tosca with the vocal control and dramatic acuity of a prima donna in mid-career."         In an article she wrote for Opera News just before that performance, Miss Kirsten attributed her vocal longevity to her refusal to accept roles that she felt were too heavy for her voice.         "I've always believed in the principle of protection, and I never sang a role I felt was not right for my voice," she wrote. "This took courage and drew some criticism along the way, but after 30 years of preserving Puccini's legato and tessitura I don't have to apologize to anyone, do I?"  Video Releases         Miss Kirsten's autobiography, "A Time to Sing," was published in 1982. Recently, several of her television performances on the "Voice of Firestone" program, including the Poker Scene from "Fanciulla," "Vissi d'Arte" from "Tosca" and several popular songs, have been released on tape by Video Arts International. And her recordings of several Romberg operettas have been reissued by Angel Records.         Miss Kirsten's first marriage, to Edward MacKayes Oates, ended in divorce in 1949. In 1951 she married Dr. Eugene Chapman, who died in 1954. In 1955, she married Dr. John Douglas French, a neurosurgeon who was director of the Brain Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles. When Dr. French developed Alzheimer's disease in the early 1980's, Miss Kirsten testified at a hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging, and in 1983 she set up the French Foundation for Alzheimer Research. Dr. French died in 1989.         She is survived by two sisters, Eleanor Parker of Tucson, Ariz., and Ethel Anderson of Lenoir, N.C., and a brother, George, also of Lenoir.       
         Judge Frances Williamson Lehrich, a lawyer and former New York City magistrate, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         She died of a heart attack, said her daughter, Jacqueline L. Becker of Boca Raton, Fla.         Judge Lehrich, who was born in Brooklyn, forged a distinguished legal career at a time when such opportunities were all but closed to women.         A graduate of Girls High School in Brooklyn and Barnard College, Judge Lehrich attended Yale Law School, where she was the first woman to become a member of the Yale Law Journal. She graduated from Yale in 1922 and joined the law firm of Sullivan & Cromwell.         In 1935, she was appointed an assistant corporation counsel of New York City during the term of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia. In 1938 he appointed her secretary to the Board of Estimate and, in 1941, to a 10-year term as a City Magistrate. Judge Lehrich was the third woman in the city's history to be appointed to the bench.         After leaving the bench in 1951, Judge Lehrich continued to practice law and to be active in civic affairs. During the 1960's and 1970's she was a member and chairman of the Arbitration Association of America.         Judge Lehrich's husband, Henry, a lawyer, died in 1966.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a grandson, a granddaughter, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Fannie Bear Besser, who at the age of 20 became one of New Jersey's first female lawyers and did legal work until she was 90, died on Friday at St. Barnabas Hospital in Livingston, N.J. She was 92 years old and lived in East Orange, N.J.         She died of multiple ailments, her family said.         Mrs. Besser, who grew up in Newark, went directly from high school to the New Jersey Law School, now a part of Rutgers University. She enrolled there because it was the only school where she could attend night classes while working days, as a secretary.         She graduated first in her class, at age 20. Because she was under 21, she had to receive special permission from the state's chief justice to take the bar examination.         After practicing general law for four years, she left her career to have her children and rear them.         In the late 1930's she returned to legal work as a volunteer lawyer for various agencies: the New Jersey Board of Mediation, the Army's Legal Department, the Governor's Commission for Refugees after the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956 and the Governor's Landlord-Tenant Committee in the 1960's.         In 1968 she became a full-time volunteer lawyer at the Essex-Newark Legal Services in Orange. There she advised and represented elderly people until her health failed 18 months ago.         Her work was honored by two Army commendations, a New Jersey State Bar award in 1986 and Governor Thomas Kean's Humanitarian of the Year Award in 1989. In 1990, the Rutgers Law School Alumni Association created the Fannie Bear Besser award for public service. She was the first recipient.         She was married for 56 years to Hyman Besser, who founded an accounting firm in Newark. He died 14 years ago.         Surviving are her son, Albert G., of South Orange; two daughters, Edith Segall of Harrison, N.Y., and Ann Scott of Windsor, Maine; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 11, 1992, Friday         An obituary on Sunday about one of the first female lawyers in New Jersey rendered her last name incorrectly in some editions. She was Fannie Bear Besser.
