         Dixy Lee Ray, former chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Governor of Washington, died yesterday at her home on Fox Island, near Tacoma. She was 79.         She had suffered for some months from a severe bronchial condition, said a friend, Lou Guzzo, who is a television commentator.         Dr. Ray, a marine biologist who championed the nuclear industry, was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to the atomic commission in 1972, and served as chairwoman from 1973 to 1975. During her tenure, she raised eyebrows in the nation's capital by living in a mobile home and taking her dogs to the office.         In 1974, she underscored the finding of an Atomic Energy Commission study of nuclear power plant safety: that the chance of mass destruction from a reactor accident was as unlikely as that of a meteor striking an urban area. "There is no question that the nuclear industry comes off very well," she said.         She issued her latest no-nonsense commentary on nuclear issues on Thursday, when she dismissed reports about cold-war-era Federal radiation experiments as alarmist.         "Everybody is exposed to radiation," Dr. Ray was quoted by The Associated Press as saying, adding, "A little bit more or a little bit less is of no consequence." Criticizing Kissinger         The Atomic Energy Commission was eventually abolished and its duties were transferred to the new Energy Research and Development Administration. Dr. Ray was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 as Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans, International Environment and Scientific Affairs.         She resigned from the post later that year, contending that Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger had ignored her office on policy matters.         It was as a Democrat that Dr. Ray was elected in 1976 to one term as the only female Governor her state has had, becoming the nation's second woman to be elected Governor without succeeding her husband. Ella T. Grasso, a Democrat, had been elected Governor of Connecticut two years before.         Dr. Ray, after her surprise victory, said that she supported the Equal Rights Amendment but that women should "stop brooding about being a woman." She told women, "If you want to do something, then train yourself and you've got to be willing to work."         Governor Ray a conservative in fiscal matters and was praised by a lobbyist in the aircraft industry as "the best friend business ever had."         She also angered environmentalists with her support of nuclear power, unhampered growth and oil supertankers.         But she could also be stern in the environmental sphere. In 1979, she ordered the low-level nuclear waste dump at a Federal reservation in Hanford, Wash., one of only three in the nation, closed temporarily after inspectors had found that some radioactive material was being hauled in unsafe trucks.         In 1980, Dr. Ray herself faced a environmental problem when Mount St. Helens repeatedly erupted, ravaging parts of the state with volcanic mud flows, flooding and ash.         While Dr. Ray was Governor, the power of her intellect and her skill as a speaker gave her an aura of great competence. But she was sharp-tongued, highly unconventional for a politician in high office, and became entangled in disputes with reporters and with other public officials.         Dr. Ray was also burdened by disaffection in her own party going into the 1980 Democratic primary and suffered a startling defeat at the hands of State Senator Jim McDermott, who offered himself as "a Governor who listens."         She was christened Margaret at her birth in 1914 in Tacoma, but she later chose the name Dixy Lee. She climbed Mount Rainier, her state's tallest peak, at age 12 -- becoming the youngest girl to do so -- and went on to graduate in 1937 from Mills College, where she also earned a master's degree. She received a doctorate in zoology from Stanford in 1945.         She taught at schools in Oakland, Calif., from 1938 to 1942 and was an associate professor of zoology at the University of Washington from 1945 to 1976.         With Mr. Guzzo she wrote two books: "Trashing the Planet: How Science Can Help Us Deal With Acid Rain, Depletion of the Ozone, and Nuclear Waste (Among Other Things)," published in 1990, and "Environmental Overkill," published this year.         She is survived by her sisters, Marion Reid of Fox Island, Dr. Jean Ray of Long Beach, Calif., Julianna Strong of Salem, Ore., and Elvista Steele of Klatskanie, Ore.       
         Dr. Jeanne Shirley Mintz, an authority on Indonesia and an Asian affairs specialist in the Defense Department, died on Tuesday at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Hospital. She was 71 and lived in Washington.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her Pentagon office said.         At the time of her death, Dr. Mintz was assistant deputy for Asia, Middle East and Southern Hemisphere affairs in the department's Economic Security Directorate. She had worked at the Pentagon for 20 years and was appointed to her current post in 1986. Spokeswoman for Indonesia         Dr. Mintz was born in Queens and graduated from Brooklyn College in 1943. She earned her master's degree and Ph.D. at Harvard University. Harvard announced that it was establishing a fellowship in her name in its Graduate School of Arts and Sciences.         During World War II, Dr. Mintz worked in New York as a political and economic analyst for the government-in-exile of the Dutch East Indies. When Indonesia gained its independence, she became spokeswoman for its delegation at the United Nations, serving until 1951.         She also held senior positions at M.I.T.'s Center for International Studies, the Asia Society in New York, the Special Operations Research office in Washington and the Center for Naval Analyses in Arlington, Va.         She wrote extensively for professional journals and was the author of several books, including "Indonesia: A Profile" (1961), and "Mohammed, Marx and Marhaen, the Roots of Indonesian Socialism" (1965). She was a past president of Executive Women in Government.         Dr. Mintz is survived by two sisters, Cynthia Puritz of Schenevus, N.Y., and Claire Cutler of Manhattan.       
         Dr. Margaret E. Courain, a retired information manager for the Federal Government and the pharmaceutical industry, died Jan. 13 at her home in South Orange, N.J. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, said Jacqueline Algon, a friend.         Starting in 1949 Dr. Courain spent 32 years at Merck & Company in Rahway, N.J., where she developed research information systems and provided development and education programs for corporate management. From 1981 until her retirement in 1987 she served with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Washington, where she was the deputy assistant administrator of its National Environmental Satellites, Data and Information Service.         She is survived by two brothers, Edward and Gerald, and a sister, Helen Courain, all of Bayonne, N.J.       
         Natalie Molostwoff, a former executive director of the School of American Ballet, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         The cause was cancer, said Nathalie Gleboff, the current executive director of the school, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet.         Ms. Molostwoff, whose original name was Natalie Merimanova, was a native of Baku, Azerbaijan, and emigrated to New York City with her mother when she was a girl. In later years, she became a secretary and was hired by the School of American Ballet in 1938.         Eugenie Ouroussow, the school's director at the time, soon discovered that Ms. Molostwoff possessed administrative skills. She became Ms. Ouroussow's assistant. When Ms. Ouroussow died in 1976, Ms. Molostwoff succeeded her as executive director, holding that post until she retired in 1991.         Ms. Molostwoff's first marriage ended in divorce, but she continued to use her married surname professionally.         She is survived by her second husband, the choreographer John Taras.       
         Esther Sherman, a theatrical agent and a vice president of the William Morris Agency, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 56.         The cause was cancer, the agency said.         Ms. Sherman was a native of Newark. She joined William Morris in 1964 as a secretary in the Chicago office and was promoted to assistant in the personal appearance department in New York in 1962. She became an agent in 1973.         One of her first clients was Howard Ashman, who went on to write "Little Shop of Horrors" and "The Little Mermaid." She also represented Edward Albee, Athol Fugard, John Patrick Shanley and Charles Fuller, among others.         She is survived by her brother and sister-in-law, Allan and Susan Sherman, of Toms River, N.J.       
         Ruth Mortimer Lancaster, curator of rare books and assistant librarian at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., died on Monday at her home in Williamsburg, Mass. She was 62.         Her husband, John Lancaster, said she had died of metastatic breast cancer.         Known professionally as Ruth Mortimer, she was a specialist in rare manuscripts and books, especially illustrated books of the Renaissance. Her detailed catalogues of such 16th-century French and Italian books at Harvard University's Houghton Library are standard reference works in the field.         In her honor, a room at Smith's Neilson Library was named the Mortimer Rare Book Room just before her death.         Ms. Mortimer, who was born in Syracuse, became associated with rare books while working as a student assistant in her freshman year at Smith. She graduated summa cum laude and received a certificate at the Shakespeare Institute of the University of Birmingham, England, as well as a master's degree at the Columbia University School of Library Service. Expanded Collections         She spent 18 years at Harvard's Houghton Library before returning to Smith as curator of rare books in 1975. Under her guidance, the Neilson Library added its Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf collections, along with materials ranging from the earliest printed books to contemporary fine-press books.         Ms. Mortimer also lectured in the art department and taught a course on the history of books until a few weeks ago.         She was the first woman to be elected president of the Bibliographical Society of America, serving from 1988 to 1992. In the 1980's she edited, with Mr. Lancaster, the society's quarterly journal. She also wrote many papers and articles for scholarly journals.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Juliet Sieveking Saunders, a former New York City school district superintendent whose doctoral dissertation became the basis for a handbook for the city's elementary school principals, died on Saturday at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. She was 86.         The cause of death was a heart attack, said Jack Bloomfield, a friend.         Mrs. Saunders started her career as a teacher and an assistant principal and then worked as principal at Junior High School 220 in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. In 1969, she was among the first district superintendents to be selected by the newly decentralized community school boards.         In her dissertation, written while she was a student at New York University's School of Education, Mrs. Saunders found that the city's elementary school principals performed an average of 446 different duties as part of their jobs.         The tasks ranged from helping to repair broken windows to fine tuning the school's curriculum. The study concluded that principals spent too much of their time doing routine paperwork and that they should get more help in managing their schools. A handbook for elementary school principals, published by the Board of Education, included much of this information and was edited by Mrs. Saunders.         She was named to the hall of fame at Hunter College, her alma mater, and received the Medal of Honor from the New York Academy of Public Education in 1988.         Mrs. Saunders's husband, Leonard, died in 1967.         She is survived by a nephew, Harry Saunders of Stamford, Conn.       
         Betty Furness, who went from doing television commercials for Westinghouse refigerators to pioneering the field of consumer affairs as a television journalist, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in New York City and Hartsdale, N.Y..         She had been treated for cancer for three years, said her husband, Leslie Midgley.         Her career spanned six decades. She began as a Hollywood actress in the 1930's and became a television spokeswoman for Westinghouse appliances in the 1950's. Between 1976 and 1992 she was a regular contributor to the "Today" program on NBC.         In 1967 President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her his special assistant for consumer affairs, though consumer groups feared that because of her association with Westinghouse, she would go easy on American industry.         She became a forceful advocate for American consumers, one who took strong stands on issues like credit regulation and federal meat inspection.         Elizabeth Mary Furness was born Jan. 3, 1916, in New York City. She was the daughter of an executive for Union Carbide. She attended the Brearley School and Bennett Junior College. Modeling and Acting         Her acting career began at age 14 when she got a modeling job with the John Robert Powers agency. Later Mr. Powers arranged for her to take a screen test.         She eventually went to Hollywood, where she appeared in 35 films, most of them low-budget productions, over the next six years.         Ms. Furness also worked in the theater in summer stock and road productions, among them "Doughgirls" and "My Sister Eileen," then moved to television.         In 1949 she had a small part in a CBS "Studio One" drama production that led Westinghouse to offer her the job as their spokeswoman. That lasted for 11 years.         She added the sentence "You can be sure if it's Westinghouse" to popular language in her live spots for refrigerators and vacuum cleaners.         She went on to do the ads in 1952 at the Republican and Democratic national conventions. Recruiter for Head Start         She first worked for President Johnson during the 1964 presidential campaign. Afterward was hired as a recruiter for the Head Start and Vista programs. In 1967 she became assistant to the President for consumer affairs.         She eventually became executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board and then commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs.         She joined WNBC-TV in New York City in 1974 and later made appearances on the network's "Today" show. As a reporter, she went from responding to consumer complaints to extensive investigations of issues like fetal alcohol syndrome, car safety and product liability lawsuits.         She is survived by her husband ; a daughter, Barbara Green; three stepchildren, Leslie Midgley, Andrea Connors and Peter J. Midgley, and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Barbara Ann Liskin, a specialist in psychiatry for adolescents and young adults who was long associated with Columbia University, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 41 and lived in Ridgefield, N.J, where she had a private practice.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Until last fall, Dr. Liskin was director of Mental Health Services at Barnard College, an assistant professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons, and an assistant attending physician at Presbyterian Hospital. She previously served as director of Young Adult Psychiatry at Columbia.         A native of Englewood, N.J., she was a cum laude graduate of Smith College. She received her medical degree at Columbia, where she also received a master's degree in nutrition.         Dr. Liskin is survived by her husband, Dr. Vincent Bonagura; twin daughters Elizabeth and Rebecca; her parents, Anita and Louis Liskin of Englewood; two brothers, David, of Carmel, Calif., and Max, of Nashville, and two sisters, Diana Chapman of Tokyo and Alisa Clausen of Aabenraa, Jutland, Denmark.       
         Betty Furness, who went from minor acting roles to reknown as a television saleswoman and then became a formidable consumer advocate, died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in New York City and Hartsdale, N.Y.         The cause was stomach cancer, said her husband, Leslie Midgley.         With the cheekbones of a model and the directness of a New England schoolmarm, Miss Furness was one of the true pioneers in television consumer journalism. In her heyday with WNBC-TV in New York, she regularly broadcast the names of errant businesses and shoddy products. She pointed television cameras at stores where New Yorkers had been cheated, and lectured the proprietors. She reported on hamburger that was too fat, on warranties that were too lean, on gadgets that were too temperamental and on business ethics that she saw as seriously flawed. She even scolded Macy's. Park Avenue Upbringing         Miss Furness essentially created a place for consumer advocacy on local television. She also spent a great deal of time off the screen promoting the cause of consumer justice. She was on the board of Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, from 1969 until she retired for health reasons in 1993, and she worked for Common Cause. She also was President Lyndon B. Johnson's special assistant for consumer affairs and was head of the New York State Consumer Protection Board in 1970 and '71. She was Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs in 1973.         Miss Furness, who had surgery for stomach cancer in 1990, was eased out of the "Today" show on NBC in 1992 after 16 years with the program. "This was their idea, not mine," she said dryly as she departed.         Miss Furness, whose original name was Elizabeth Mary Furness, was born on Jan. 3, 1916, in New York City, the daughter of George Choate Furness, an executive with what was then called Union Carbon and Carbide, and Florence Sturtevant Furness. The Furness family was well off and young Betty was raised on Park Avenue and sent to the Bennett School in Dutchess County, N.Y. In 1932, before graduating, she dropped out to become an actress.         It was the Depression, and her father had advised her to learn "something useful." She got summer jobs with the John Robert Powers Modeling Agency, but to her father's dismay earned only $80 in two summers of work. But she was blonde and trim, and Mr. Powers noticed her. He liked the way she used her voice and her gray-green eyes, and he arranged for her to take a screen test at RKO.         The only acting she had done was in school theatricals, but just a year after she left the Bennett School, RKO was touting her as a bright new talent. She had secondary roles in 35 films in Hollywood and later called them all appalling except "Swing Time," which starred Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and "Magnificent Obsession," both produced in the mid-1930's. She left the screen in 1937 and moved to the stage. With few exceptions -- the stock and road productions of "Golden Boy," "My Sister Eileen" and "Doughgirls" -- the career that had started with promise seemed to be going nowhere. Early TV Participant         In 1948, with commercial television just starting, Miss Furness landed a job with the DuMont Television Network, which signed her to do a 15-minute show called "Fashions, Coming and Becoming."         A year later, somebody at Westinghouse saw her in a "Studio One" drama and offered her a job as the company's representative on television. For more than 11 years Miss Furness was a staple on evening television, frequently standing in front of refrigerators and waxing eloquent about their performance.         In 1952, 1956 and 1960, Miss Furness did the Westinghouse commercials during the Republican and Democratic National Conventions and developed a strong interest in politics. She worked for Abraham Ribicoff in Connecticut when he made his first successful race for the United States Senate in 1962. After meeting Lady Bird Johnson and Muriel Humphrey, she also made recruiting trips for Head Start and Vista, the Volunteers in Service to America. Left Rockefeller Job         In 1962, she was the hostess of a five-minute radio show called "A Woman's World," in which she talked about food, clothes, child rearing, family relationships, teen-agers and the aged. Late in 1962, she worked on an ABC-TV show called "Answering Service." The show was nominated for an Emmy Award, but ABC dropped her all the same.         Miss Furness abruptly quit as Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's consumer affairs adviser in 1971, charging that the New York State Legislature did not take her recommendations seriously enough. She ran New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs in 1973. After that she worked briefly for McCall's magazine as a contributing editor and wrote a column for consumers.         Despite the number and diversity of her activities, she was never able to completely shake off her image as a product saleswoman. "I feel I'm a very serious person who wants to do things," she once said, "but people keep talking about refrigerators. I'm tired of telling the story about the refrigerator door that didn't stick, and I'm bored with the image."         In 1937 Miss Furness married Johnny Green, the composer and conductor, with whom she had a daughter, Barbara. The couple divorced in 1943. In 1945, she married Hugh B. Ernst, a radio announcer, who died in 1950. She married Mr. Midgley, a CBS News producer, in 1967.         In addition to her husband and her daughter, she is survived by three stepchildren, Leslie Midgley, Andrea Connors and Peter J. Midgley, and two grandchildren.       
         Lois R. Murphy, an expert on environmental law and a partner in the New York law firm of Cahill, Gordon & Reindel, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 49 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was an acute respiratory incident, her family said.         She was a graduate of Pace University Law School, where she was editor in chief of the Environmental Law Review. She later served as assistant regional counsel of the New York Environmental Protection Agency. She joined Cahill, Gordon as an associate in 1988 and became a partner this January.         She is survived by her husband, Eugene Zuriff; her daughter, Jennifer Reisman of Atlanta; two stepsons, Laurence Zuriff of Washington and Bryan Zuriff of Los Angeles, and a sister, Judith, who lives in Florida.       
         Dr. Dorothy F. Berezin, a child psychologist who served as a municipal welfare official from 1969 to 1978, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was kidney disease, said her daughter, Judith A. Berezin.         Dr. Berezin served as an assistant commissioner and director of child and adolescent services for the New York City Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation Services from 1971 to 1978. Previously she had been chief research scientist at that department involved in program planning.         She was a graduate of Smith College and received a doctorate in psychology from Columbia University Teachers College.         She is survived by two daughters, Judith, of Manhattan, and Joan Berezin of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Muriel R. Cooper, a graphic designer and professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, died on Thursday at the New England Medical Center in Boston. Professor Cooper, who lived in Brookline, Mass., was 68.         She died of a heart attack, officials at M.I.T. said.         Ms. Cooper joined the M.I.T. Press in 1967 as its first art director and helped produce more than 500 books. She began teaching at M.I.T. in 1974, concentrating on the relationship between graphics and technology. She became an assistant professor in 1977 and a full professor in 1988.         Ms. Cooper was a graduate of Ohio State University and the Massachusetts College of Art. In 1992 she was the first recipient of the Robert P. Gersin Design Excellence Award, given to graduates of the Massachusetts College of Art.         She is survived by two sisters, Helene Berger of Boston and Charlotte Lopoten of Philadelphia.       
         Anni Albers, a leading textile artist of the 20th century, died yesterday at her home in Orange, Conn., near New Haven. She was the widow of the abstract artist Josef Albers and was 94 years old.         Mrs. Albers was cured of lymphoma 20 years ago and died of old age, said Dr. Samuel Bobrow, her physician.         "From her earliest days as a student and master at the Bauhaus in the 1920's, Anni Albers was an explorer and form giver in textiles," said Jack Lenor Larsen, the New York designer and textile producer. "And in America, she continued in her role as a prophet, teacher and innovative weaver."  A Reluctant Weaver         Mrs. Albers was the last surviving teacher at the Bauhaus, the German design school founded at Weimar in 1919, and closed by the Nazis in 1933. When she enrolled as a student at the Bauhaus in 1922, she hoped to study wall painting but became a weaver reluctantly, when no other workshop was available.         After she received her diploma in 1930, Mrs. Albers and her husband, whom she had met at the Bauhaus and married in 1925, stayed on as teachers, he in design, she as a part-time instructor in textiles and as the acting director of the weaving workshop. When the Bauhaus moved to Berlin in 1932, they moved with it, and Josef Albers continued teaching while Mrs. Albers worked privately as a weaver.         In 1933, after the Gestapo had padlocked the doors of the Bauhaus, Mrs. Albers met the architect Philip Johnson, then at the Museum of Modern Art, who was visiting Berlin and asked her if she and her husband wished to come to the United States. On his return to New York, he spoke with Edward Warburg, the art patron, who was assisting the founders of the Black Mountain College in North Carolina, a progressive school of the arts.  A Solo Exhibition         Though they spoke no English, and did not know where North Carolina was, the Alberses went. From 1933 to 1939, she was an assistant professor of art at Black Mountain. In 1949, she became the first weaver to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, the museum which owns the finest collection of her works.         Mrs. Albers's textiles reflected the Abstract style in painting in their geometric patterns and complex weaves. She used knotting and intertwining of linked threads to enrich the texture of her works. She also designed fabrics for Knoll International. Her 1926 designs for rugs are now being produced by Larsen Carpet. And her 1950's books, "On Weaving" and "On Designing," are considered a must for enthusiasts and students of design.         When she was 70, Mrs. Albers gave up weaving and became a printmaker, at which she was prolific for more than a decade. She produced many editions for Tamarind Lithography Workshop and Gemini G.E.L., both of Los Angeles, and Tyler Graphics of Mount Kisco, N.Y.  A Cameo Role         In her 80's, she made her debut in films in 1984, playing a cameo role looking at unedited film, in Maximilian Schell's "Marlene."         Born in Berlin and named Annelise Fleischmann, she was the daughter of a prosperous furniture manufacturer. Mrs. Albers began her art studies as a teen-ager studying drawing and painting with Martin Brandenburg, an impressionist painter. She also attended the School of Applied Art in Hamburg before going to the Bauhaus.         She is survived by her brother, Hans Farman of Old Greenwich, Conn.       
         Jane Elizabeth Richmond, a writer with a special interest in films and television, died on Monday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 57 and had homes in Pawcatuck, Conn., and Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Richmond, a native of Westerly, R.I., was a graduate of Barnard College and worked in advertising before turning to editing and writing. As an editor for Partisan Review, she was associated with the Beat writers. She also served as a literary assistant to Mary McCarthy.         Her fiction and nonfiction appeared in Partisan Review, The New Yorker and other publications. She also wrote for television and adapted several short plays from the repertory of the Grand Guignol Theater of Paris for presentation in the United States.         Ms. Richmond is survived by her father, Richard, and a brother, Barry, both of Stonington, Conn.       
         Jean Fredette Ingrao, one of the first women elected to high office in the A.F.L.-C.I.O., died on Thursday at her home in Falls Church, Va. She was 63.         She died of cancer, said Michael Byrne, a spokesman for the labor federation.         Mrs. Ingrao (pronounced in-GRAY-oh) was elected in 1979 as executive secretary-treasurer of the A.F.L.-C.I.O. Maritime Trades Department, which represents workers in 42 unions in the shipbuilding and seafaring trades and in other fields. She retired in 1993.         Mrs. Ingrao, who was born in Washington and attended schools there, began her career in 1950 as an aide to George Meany, then president of the American Federation of Labor. She later served as administrative assistant to the federation's executive secretary-treasurer.         She is survived by her husband, Leonard; two sons, Michael, of Falls Church, and Mark, of Alexandria, Va.; two sisters, Barbara Leonard of McLean, Va., and Mary Schmeich of Gaithersburg, Md., and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Enid R. Peschel, a medical educator and researcher at Yale University, died on Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. Dr. Peschel, who lived in Woodbridge, Conn., was 51.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Dr. Richard E. Peschel.         Dr. Peschel was an adjunct assistant professor of internal medicine and co-director of the program for humanities in medicine at the School of Medicine at Yale. She graduated from Brown University and received a doctorate in French history from Harvard University.         She and her husband wrote "When a Doctor Hates a Patient and Other Chapters in a Young Physician's Life" (1986). She also was the author or co-editor of 10 other books.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Colette, also of Woodbridge, and a sister, Nola Royce of Delmar, N.Y.       
         Mary C. McDonald, a retired assistant director of continuing education for the New York City schools, died on Monday at her home in Rockville Centre, L.I. She was 83.         The cause was chronic kidney failure, her family said.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. McDonald graduated from Hunter College and Columbia University Teachers College. She took a job as a substitute teacher during the Depression, then in the mid-1930's became the Department of Parks director of recreation for Queens.         She returned to the Board of Education in 1948 and specialized in adult literacy and English as a second language. She was also a consultant to the State Division of Higher Education, the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare and the Governments of Egypt and Greece. She retired from the school system in 1971.         Mrs. McDonald is survived by a son, Dr. Brian F. of Rockville Centre; a sister, Anna Gordon of Bayside, Queens, and two grandchildren. Her husband of 34 years, F. Joseph McDonald, died in 1983.       
         Dr. Marion F. Langer, a former executive director of the American Orthopsychiatric Association and an expert on widowhood, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was cancer, said Karen Kun of the association's staff.         Dr. Langer, who had a Ph.D. in sociology from New York University, was on the boards of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in Washington, and the National Coalition Against Censorship.         She was the orthopsychiatric association's executive director from 1953 until she retired in 1988. The association, which has its headquarters in Manhattan, was founded in 1924 by Karl Menninger (1893-1990), the psychiatrist, and others to advance a preventive approach to treating mental illness. Orthopsychiatry offers treatment through a collaborative approach involving such fields as psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric social work and other sciences.         Her writings included a book, "Learning to Live as a Widow," published in 1957. In an interview in 1963, she said that widows usually blame their husbands for dying, although that feeling is irrational.         "Unlike the divorcee, who is expected freely to express her resentment toward her former spouse, the widow is not supposed to be angry," Dr. Langer said. As a result, she said, feelings of anger are repressed and affect the widow's social relationships.         Dr. Langer was born and raised in Newburgh, N.Y. and studied at Smith College and elsewhere before receiving her Ph.D. in 1949. She was assistant director of the Child Study Association of America before going to the Orthopsychiatric Association.         Over the years, she taught at City College, New York University, the Hunter College School of Social Work and elsewhere.         She married Julius Rosenberg, a lawyer, in 1940; he died in 1948. Her 1957 marriage, to Samuel Gruber, also a lawyer, ended in divorce in 1973.         Dr. Langer is survived by a son, Seth Rosenberg of Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Rose Laub Coser, a sociologist and professor emeritus at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, died on Sunday at her summer home in Wellfleet, Mass. She was 78.         Dr. Coser, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., died of kidney failure, her family said.         She taught at Stony Brook from 1968 until her retirement in 1987, after which she moved to Cambridge. At her death she was an adjunct professor of sociology at Boston College, specializing in the family and medical sociology.         She was born in Berlin and reared in Belgium; she came to the United States in 1939. She started studying philosophy at the New School for Social Research but switched to sociology at Columbia University, where she earned her Ph.D. under the supervision of Robert K. Merton. Taught Sociology at Harvard         Dr. Coser began her teaching career as an instructor at Wellesley College. In 1959 she began teaching at the Harvard University Medical School as an assistant professor of sociology in the department of psychiatry, and later became an associate professor. She also taught at Northeastern University in Boston.         She was the author of "Life in the Ward" (1962) and was involved as a contributor to or editor of "Sociological Studies of Health and Sickness" (1960), "Studies in the Hospital" (1963) and "The Family, Its Structure and Functions" (revised in 1974).         Her recent writing includes "Training in Ambiguity: Learning Through Doing in a Mental Hospital" (1979), "In Defense of Modernity: Role Complexity and Individual Autonomy" (1991) and "Laughter Among Colleagues" (1993). All three books remain in print.         Dr. Coser is survived by her husband of 52 years, Dr. Lewis A. Coser, also a sociologist; a daughter, Dr. Ellen C. Perrin of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Steven M. of Melrose, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Joan Harrison, a producer and screenwriter who helped write the scripts for "Rebecca," "Foreign Correspondent" and other films directed by Alfred Hitchcock, died on Aug. 14 in London. She was 83.         Miss Harrison was born in Guildford, Surrey, England, where her father published two local newspapers. After attending boarding school in Kent, she received an honor's degree in philosophy, politics and economics at St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where she occasionally reviewed films for the student newspaper. She later studied at the Sorbonne.         In 1933, she was hired as a secretary by Hitchcock, who was at work on "The Man Who Knew Too Much." A poor secretary by her own description, she soon graduated to reading books and scripts, writing synopses and contributing to scripts. She received her first writing credit on Hitchcock's "Jamaica Inn." From Hitchcock to Hollywood         In 1939, Miss Harrison accompanied Hitchcock to Hollywood, working as his assistant and as a writer on "Rebecca," "Suspicion," "Saboteur" and "Shadow of a Doubt."         In 1941, Miss Harrison went out on her own and was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to write the script for "The Sun Is My Undoing." In 1943, she was hired as a producer at Universal, where her first film was "Phantom Lady," a melodrama starring Franchot Tone. In 1944, she produced and shared the screenwriting credit for "Dark Waters," a thriller starring Merle Oberon.         In the 1940's and 50's, she produced the mystery thrillers "Third Eye," "Uncle Harry," "Nocturne," "Ride the Pink Horse," "Once More, My Darling," "Eye Witness" and "Circle of Danger."         From 1955 to 1962, she produced the television series "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." With Norman Lloyd, she was responsible for selecting stories, hiring writers and directors, casting and supervising the production of each episode. She also produced the television series "Journey Into the Unknown."         She is survived by her husband, the mystery writer Eric Ambler.       
         Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, for nearly two decades the dean of New York University's School of Social Work, died yesterday at her home in South Orange, N.J. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said a university spokeswoman.         Dr. Ehrenkranz, who was credited with enhancing the school's national reputation, joined its staff in 1966 and became its dean in 1977. In her more than 17 years as dean, the school became one of the largest schools of social work in the nation, enrolling more than 1,000 students in undergraduate and graduate programs.         Under her leadership, the school also pioneered the holistic approach to clinical social work and became the first institution in the New York metropolitan area to offer a doctorate in clinical social work.         In recognition of her contributions, New York University had announced that the school would be renamed the Shirley M. Ehrenkranz School of Social Work. Jay Oliva, president of the university, said yesterday that there would be a renaming ceremony on Sept. 19. Was a Former Caseworker         Dr. Ehrenkranz received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College, master's degrees in English from Temple University, in social economy and social research from Bryn Mawr College and in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, and a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia University.         Before joining New York University, she served as a field instructor at the Rutgers University Graduate School of Social Work and a research assistant at the Columbia University School of Social Work. She was also a caseworker and case supervisor in agencies for families and children. She was president of the New York State Association of Deans in 1980-81 and 1988-89.         She is survived by her husband, Fred Kasoff; two daughters, Pamela Ehrenkranz of New York City and Jean LeGrand of Chicago; a sister, Babette Cohen of Rosyln Heights, L.I., and 16 grandchildren.         Correction:  August 27, 1994, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, omitted a survivor. He is her son, Dr. Joel Ehrenkranz of New Vernon, N.J.       
         Christine Lynn Potts, a Russian affairs expert on the staff of the National Security Council at the White House, died on Thursday at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 36.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Miss Potts, who was from Zanesville, Ohio, received a bachelor's degree in political science from Smith College and, in 1982, a master's degree in Russian studies from the University of Michigan. She began her career at the Brookings Institution as a research assistant on Soviet energy and economics.         She then spent two years at the Kennan Institute in Washington and went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1987. She joined the staff of the National Security Council in 1992, specializing in Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs. At the security council she was the principal policy assistant on the economies of the republics of the former Soviet Union.         Miss Potts also served as the executive secretary of a commission established by Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia to foster economic and technological cooperation between the two nations. In that capacity, she helped to arrange the panel's first meeting last September.         She is survived by her parents, Robert and Jean Potts of Callawassie Island, S.C.; and two brothers, Mark, of Bozeman, Mont., and Jeff, of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Jessie Sumner, an Illinois Republican who was the first woman elected to a county judgeship in her state and a conservative member of Congress from 1939 to 1947, died on Wednesday in Iroquois Memorial Hospital in Watseka, Ill. She was 96 and lived in nearby Milford.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Donna Rae Mann, Miss Sumner's assistant.         At her death, Miss Sumner was the president of Sumner National Bank, in Sheldon, Ill., which was founded by her father, Aaron Taylor Sumner. She took the post in 1966.         Miss Sumner was born on a farm in Iroquois County, Ill., grew up in that county and graduated from Smith College in 1920. She studied law at the University of Chicago and at Oxford and Columbia Universities. She worked as a lawyer in Chicago, New York and Milford.         In 1937, she became a judge in Iroquois County before being elected to the House of Representatives in 1938. She held the view, shared by many in her district in east-central Illinois, that the United States should not get involved in the war that was brewing in Europe.         After being elected to the House, she became nationally known as a foe of President Franklin D. Roosevelt and of his New Deal program and other policies. "What do I think of President Roosevelt?" she once asked, and then said she had come "to bury Caesar, not to praise him."         After World War II began in Europe in 1939, she found herself in a minority in Congress in voting against expanding the Navy. She was also among more than 100 representatives who voted, only months before the attack on Pearl Harbor, against extending the draft for a year.         After the United States entered the war in 1941, she criticized the country's allies, the conduct of the war, and Roosevelt Administration measures on the home front. She gained attention for her opposition to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which cared for refugees in Europe after the war, saying that if it was humanitarian, "so is keeping a gigolo."         Miss Sumner decided not to run for re-election in 1946. She then resumed practicing law in Milford and helped manage her family's insurance company, grain elevators and farms, in addition to the bank.         Survivors include a nephew, three nieces, six great-nephews and a great-niece.       
         Nelle Fisher, a versatile dancer and choreographer whose performing experience ranged from Martha Graham to Broadway to television musicals, died on Wednesday at Aldercrest, a nursing home in Edmonds, Wash. She was 79.         She died of complications of Parkinson's disease, said her sister Clare, also of Edmonds.         Miss Fisher was born in Berkeley, Calif., and reared in Seattle, where she received her initial training in ballet and modern dance. After moving to New York City, she appeared with the Martha Graham Dance Company (1938-40), began presenting programs of her own choreography and, in the 40's and 50's, performed in such Broadway musicals as "One Touch of Venus," "On the Town," "Make Mine Manhattan" and "The Golden Apple." In 1957 she choreographed "The Best of Burlesque." She was also a dancer and choreographer for several television revues in the 1950's, including Max Liebman's "Your Show of Shows."         During the 60's and 70's she directed the Memphis Ballet and "The Littlest Circus," a touring pantomime show for children, and taught in the Netherlands and at the North Carolina School of the Arts. Moving back to the Seattle area, she became an assistant to her sister Dorothy, a teacher and choreographer, who died in 1988.         Miss Fisher is survived by her sister Clare.       
         Katherine Elliott, an advocate for simpler and more practical methods of health care for poor people, died on Saturday at the Hospital of St. John and St. Elizabeth in London, where she lived. She was 75.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Veronica Elliott of Washington, said.         Dr. Elliott was among those professionals in an emerging medical field in the 1950's and 60's who stressed that the technology used to meet the health care needs of any population must be appropriate to their own resources and skills.         Recognizing that diarrhea was the greatest killer of children in poor countries, for example, she aided in the development of a simple oral rehydration therapy consisting of a foiled-packet containing a powder that could be mixed with water to provide nutrients the sick child needed to survive.         In an effort to make childbirth safer, she helped to develop kits for midwives with a clean plastic sheet, cotton, soap and an antiseptic razor to cut the umblilical cord.         Dr. Elliott, whose work took her to Pakistan, Thailand, Indonesia, Bangladesh and Iran, also advocated greater reliance on trained medical workers to see to the health needs of people in remote areas.         She received a medical degree from the University of London's School of Medicine for Women and after World War II she joined the National Health Service. She was an assistant director at the Ciba Foundation from 1966 to 1981.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a second daughter, Rose, and a son, Tony, both of London, and six grandchildren.       
         Catherine Filene Shouse, the philanthropist and arts patron who was the founder and major benefactor of the Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts in Virginia, died yesterday at her home in Naples, Fla. She was 98 and also had homes in Washington, Easton, Md., and Vienna, Va., where Wolf Trap is situated.         The cause of death was heart failure, said Carol Harford, a longtime friend who is president emeritus of the Wolf Trap Foundation, which presents the park's arts programs under the auspices of the Department of the Interior.         Mrs. Shouse, the heiress to a retailing fortune, was a lifelong champion of the performing arts whose accomplishments and philanthropic ventures earned recognition from the highest quarters. In 1977, President Gerald Ford gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A year earlier, Queen Elizabeth II had made her Dame Commander of the British Empire. This past October, she was among 12 Americans to receive the National Medal of Arts.         Catherine Filene was born in Boston in 1896. Her grandfather, William Filene, was the founder of the Filene's department-store chain, and her father, Lincoln Filene, founded Federated Department Stores. She graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., in 1918, and earned a master's degree in education at Harvard University in 1923.         Over seven decades, Mrs. Shouse held a remarkable variety of public and private posts. In 1919, she became the first woman appointed to the Democratic National Committee, and in the mid-1920's, she served under President Calvin Coolidge as chairwoman of the First Federal Prison for Women, where she instituted a job training and rehabilitation program.         In the 1940's, she became a dog breeder, importing hunting dogs from Germany and Switzerland and starting her own kennel at Wolf Trap Farm, a tract of land across the Potomac River, 15 miles west of Washington, that she had purchased in 1930.         In 1949, she joined the National Symphony Orchestra's board, and she served as its vice president from 1951 through 1968. In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her to the first board of the National Cultural Center, now known as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to which she was reappointed twice by President Richard M. Nixon. As late as 1991, she was invited by the Yale School of Music to serve on its board.         Mrs. Shouse's most lasting legacy, however, is Wolf Trap. In 1966, at the age of 70, she donated 100 acres of the farm in Vienna to the United States Government to create a national park for the performing arts. There, under the auspices of the Department of the Interior, Mrs. Shouse established the Wolf Trap Foundation to manage the park, arrange programming and raise money, a unique partnership among the public and private sectors for managing an arts center. The park opened in 1971 and since then has been home to performances by some of the world's great musicians, dancers, singers and actors.         In 1982, the main amphitheater burned to the ground, but Mrs. Shouse led the drive to resurrect it, and a new theater, the 7,000-seat Filene Center (half the $18 million cost came from a Congressional appropriation), opened in 1984. It is now visited by some 500,000 people annually.         During her last decade, Mrs. Shouse, who was known to her friends as Kay, suffered from arthritis but remained a familiar figure at Wolf Trap, touring the grounds in a golf cart.         She was married twice, in 1921, to Alvin E. Dodd, a businessman from whom she was divorced in 1930. Two years later, she married Jouett Shouse, the chairman of the Democratic National Executive Committee. Shouse, a lawyer and businessman, had been a Congressman from Kansas and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Coolidge. He died in 1967.         Mrs. Shouse is survived by a daughter, Joan Dodd Tolley of Naples, four grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Moton Hubbard, who was deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs from 1964 to 1970, making her the top-ranking black woman in the Johnson Administration at the time, died on Sunday at her home in Chevy Chase, Md. She was 82.         Ms. Hubbard, who retired in 1970 at the onset of Cushing's disease, an adrenal disorder, died of congestive heart failure, said Marc L. Alper of Rockview, Md., a family friend.         In her State Department post, she worked at developing programs intended to eliminate discrimination against black soldiers during the Vietnam War. She also oversaw the department's public services and news offices.         During World War II, she worked for the Federal Security Agency, helping to organize arrangements for war workers and was a race and human relations consultant. She joined the State Department in 1963 as a coordinator of women's activities.         The daughter of a pioneer in the civil rights movement, Dr. Robert Russa Moton, she grew up on the campus of Tuskegee Institute, where her father had succeeded its founder, Booker T. Washington, as president. She was educated at Boston University.         Her husband, Maceo W. Hubbard, a Justice Department official, died in 1991. She is survived by two sisters, Catherine Patterson of Exeter, N.H., and Jennie Moton Taylor of Indianapolis.       
         Aminda Badeau Wilkins, a retired welfare official and the widow of Roy Wilkins, longtime executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. She was 89 and lived in Jamaica, Queens.         She suffered a brief illness, said Mildred Roxboro, director of development of the N.A.A.C.P.         Born in St. Louis, Mrs. Wilkins trained at the University of Chicago and started her career with a Chicago settlement house and doing case work in St. Louis. After her marriage to Mr. Wilkins in 1929, she moved to New York City and became a supervisor in the Department of Welfare.         She later carried out special projects for the commissioner and served as director of community relations. President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the National Advisory Council on Extension and Continuing Education, and she served on the Department of Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Armed Forces. She retired in 1971 as an assistant commissioner in the city's Department of Welfare.         Mr. Wilkins died in 1981.
