         Teresa Teng, a singer from Taiwan whose love songs won her spectacular fame across East Asia, died suddenly on a holiday in Thailand on Monday. She was 40.         Miss Teng had been having respiratory difficulties since earlier this year, according to the Kyodo News Agency in Tokyo. She reportedly died after an asthmatic attack in the northern resort city of Chiang Mai, where she was vacationing with a French friend.         Kyodo reported that Thai doctors attributed her death to heart failure, but an autopsy had not yet been conducted.         Miss Teng was especially famous in China, where for much of the 1980's she was a litmus test of the political winds: when the authorities eased controls, her music sold briskly in stalls in the tiniest towns; when the hard-liners clamped down, her music was banned.         She was one of the first foreign singers whose music was swept into China after the country started opening up in the late 1970's, and she soon became a symbol of capitalist joys.         Known in Chinese as Deng Lijun, Miss Teng's surname was the same as that of Deng Xiaoping, China's paramount leader. So she was jokingly known as Little Deng, and in some circles she was nearly as famous as he. Even peasants in the countryside were familiar with her songs and brightly colored costumes.         Many other foreign singers became popular in China, but none captured the hearts of the country as she did.         From Singapore to Japan, Miss Teng was a superstar and brilliant linguist. She sang in Mandarin Chinese, Cantonese Chinese, Japanese and English, and in recent years she had lived in Japan and become popular among both the young and the old.         Her songs were bright and mellifluous, and her voice clear and sweet. Among her best-known songs were "The Moon Is a Reflection of My Heart" and "When Will You Return." In a song called "The Story of a Little Town," she sings:         Many are the stories of a small town         Full of joy and happiness.         If you came to this little town,         How much you would reap.         It looks like a painting,         It sounds like a song.         Relatives flew to Thailand today to make funeral arrangements.       
         Phyllis Hyman, a New York jazz singer whose most recent hits included "When You Get Right Down To It" and "Living in Confusion," died yesterday afternoon in Manhattan, a possible suicide, the police said. She was 45.         An assistant to Ms. Hyman found the singer unconscious in her bedroom at 211 West 56th Street around 2 P.M., said Det. Dwight Cunningham, a police spokesman. She died at Roosevelt Hospital at 3:50 P.M.         The police found pills and a note, the detective said. The police did not disclose the contents of the note.         Ms. Hyman, a legal secretary who sang jazz and rhythm and blues and recently performed rap, had a starring role in "Sophisticated Ladies," a Broadway musical that paid tribute to Duke Ellington.

         Helen Singer Kaplan, a pioneer in the field of sex therapy and founder of the country's first clinic for sexual disorders established at a medical school, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Kaplan was considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods.         She agreed with others in the field that sexual difficulties often had superficial origins. But she held that, in case an unconscious conflict lay at the root of the disorder, it could indicate deep emotional problems and require the therapist to resort to more analytical means.         Consequently, her approach was seen as psychosexual therapy, to distinguish it from sex therapy. And her arrival on the scene manifested the way psychoanalysts gradually adapted to new sex-therapy techniques.         Although not so well known to the public as the sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson, Dr. Kaplan was a leader in her field. She also had her differences with the Masters-Johnson team, questioning their advocacy and use of two therapists working together because, she felt, one therapist of either sex would suffice.         Working as a clinical professor of psychiatry, she became the founder, in 1970, of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, one of the country's most prominent psychiatric clinics and part of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center complex. She remained its director until her death.         Born Helen Singer in Vienna on Feb. 6, 1929, she came to the United States in 1940 and became a citizen in 1947. She graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Syracuse University in 1951 and earned a master's degree in psychology at Columbia University in 1952. She got a Ph.D in psychology in 1955 at Columbia.         In 1959, she received her medical degree from New York Medical College, where she completed a comprehensive course in psychoanalysis in 1970.         She trained in clinical psychology at Veterans Administration hospitals and clinics in Montrose, N.Y., and the Bronx, interned at Bronx Hospital and completed her training as a fellow of psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital and New York Medical College-Metropolitan Hospital Center.         There the first phase of her professional teaching career unfolded as she developed and coordinated a basic behavioral science program for psychiatric residents as well as a freshman medical course in psychiatry. She also developed and taught a required course in psychopharmacology.         From 1960 until she established her program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, she was an associate professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College and an associate attending psychiatrist at Metropolitan, Flower and B.S. Coler Hospitals. At Medical College and Metropolitan Hospital Center she also served as chief of psychosomatic and consultation services, co-director of the Behavior Therapy Unit, chairman of the Behavioral Science Teaching Program and director of a program for women residents with children.         She established new programs, including one to train the psychiatric and obstetrics-gynecology staff in human sexuality.         She was appointed a professor of psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in 1970. Aside from directing her program at the Payne Whitney, she was in charge of undergraduate teaching of psychiatry and curriculum development until 1976.         Her human sexuality program included an outpatient clinic for the evaluation and treatment of psychosexual disorders. This generated clinical materials for postgraduate training courses for enrolled physicians and mental-health professionals. Dr. Kaplan was in charge of all education and training programs in human sexuality for Cornell medical students and psychiatric residents at the Payne Whitney.         Dr. Kaplan was credited with 110 publications and 127 lectures and presentations taking in the full range of her specialty.         Several of her books remain in print. These include "New Sex Therapy: Active Treatment of Sexual Dysfunctions" (Random House, 1974), "Disorders of Sexual Desires and Other New Concepts and Techniques in Sex Therapy" (Brunner-Mazel, 1979), "The Evaluation of Sexual Disorders: Psychological and Medical Aspects" (Brunner, 1983), "The Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy" (Brunner; 2d ed., 1987), "How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation" (Brunner, 1989), and, with Donald F. Klein, "Sexual Aversion, Sexual Phobias and Panic Disorder" (Brunner, 1987).         Dr. Kaplan is survived by her husband of 15 years, Charles P. Lazarus; two sons, Dr. Phillip Kaplan and Dr. Peter Kaplan, a daughter, Jennifer Kaplan-D'Addio, all of the Upper East Side; a brother, Frank Singer of California, and two grandsons.         Correction:  August 23, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary on Saturday of Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan, founder of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, omitted a survivor. She is Sofie Kane of Manhattan, Dr. Kaplan's mother.       
         Gloria Wills Landes, a former Broadway showgirl who capped a brief, effervescent career by founding and directing an acclaimed school for aspiring teen-age actors and playwrights, died on Friday at her home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 69.         Mrs. Landes was the director of the SUNY Youth Theater in Purchase, N.Y., until she became ill last year. She had breast cancer, her family said.         If Gloria Wills's days on Broadway had been a Busby Berkeley musical, she would have been the star's funny and bubbly best friend, the one who has her moments in the spotlight but gives up a promising career to marry a rich businessman.         Mrs. Landes's career lasted only three years, but by the time she left a Broadway-bound show in Philadelphia in 1948 to marry Jack Landes, a wealthy silver importer, she had something to tell her grandchildren.  Like hundreds of other stage-struck singers, dancers and actors who have passed through Broadway's revolving door over the years, she had a scrapbook proving that she had been a part of a great tradition.         She may have spent more time auditioning than performing, but she was a Brooklyn girl who could belt out a song, and her persistent auditions at least made an impression on Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein. Rodgers once said she had auditioned for every part in "Oklahoma!" except the villain, Jud Fry.  If she missed a week trying out for the part of Ado Annie, the "girl who can't say no," Hammerstein would ask if she had been sick.         She may not have been a star, but the critic Walter Kerr once called her "one of the funniest things on Broadway," and she had her share of brushes with destiny and Broadway cliches.         In 1945, for example, she was in the chorus of "Carousel" when she discovered new meaning in the old theater good-luck wish of "break a leg." A featured singer got sick, and her understudy, rushing in to replace her, fell down the dressing room steps and actually broke a leg. Mrs. Landes, then all of 19 years old, spent the next six weeks singing "You'll Never Walk Alone."         Then there was the birthday party for "Oklahoma!" She did a comic version of Agnes de Mille's famous second-act ballet that left Miss de Mille in stitches and persuaded Rodgers and Hammerstein to cast her as Beulah, the campus vamp, in the musical "Allegro" in 1947.         That led to a part in the revue "Make Mine Manhattan," with Sid Caesar, but Mrs. Landes, who had doubts about the part and her future in the theater, left the show in Philadelphia to accept what she decided was a better offer: to marry Mr. Landes and live happily ever after.         That is more or less what she did. Several months after she was married, Cole Porter asked her to be Bianca in "Kiss Me Kate," but she was pregnant by then with the first of her four sons.         Unlike many other short-term performers who end up in the suburbs, Mrs. Landes found a second act. After performing in summer stock, she established a school for teen-age performers that was absorbed by the State University of New York at Purchase, where she taught a generation of young actors and playwrights, including Matt Dillon.         Mrs. Landes's husband died in 1989. She is survived by her sons, Mark of Potomac, Md., Dan of Brooklyn, Robert of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Peter of San Rafael, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and a brother, Herbery Wolfson of Wilmington, Del.       
         Benay Venuta, whose career in show business began as a teen-age dancer in 1925 and ended with a bit part in Woody Allen's 1993 movie, "Manhattan Murder Mystery," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter Patricia Winter.         A singer, actress, radio personality, painter and sculptor, Ms. Venuta was best known as an active participant in New York theater for more than 50 years. Her Broadway career began when, as a virtual unknown, she replaced Ethel Merman, who became her close friend, in Cole Porter's "Anything Goes" in 1935.         Ms. Venuta went on to leading roles on Broadway in such shows as "By Jupiter," "Nellie Bly," "Hazel Flagg," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye" and "Copper and Brass." She toured and played summer stock and regional theaters in "A Little Night Music," "Bus Stop," "Gypsy," "Come Blow Your Horn," "Auntie Mame," "Light Up the Sky" and "Pal Joey."         She also performed at Lincoln Center in revivals of "Annie Get Your Gun" and "Carousel."         In Hollywood, Ms. Venuta appeared in films including "The Fuzzy Pink Nightgown," "Call Me Mister" and "Annie Get Your Gun."         Ms. Venuta was named Benvenuta Rose Crooke at her birth in San Francisco in 1911.         In a 1935 interview, she said that when she quit high school to go into show business she "just added a 'ay' to Ben and the rest I guess you can figure."         Ms. Venuta said her grandfather sent her to a finishing school in Geneva. She dropped out (but not before learning French and Italian), went off to London and came home in 1929 to discover her family was broke.         "My father was dead, and I had to go to work," she said. "You know the rest -- nightclubs, radio, hoofing -- then this."         She was speaking of her big break in "Anything Goes."         For much of her life, Ms. Venuta painted and made sculptures, and for a time in the 1970's her Plexiglas sculptures were sold at Bonwit Teller in Manhattan for $150 to $1,500.         Ms. Venuta was married and divorced three times.         In addition to Ms. Winter, she is survived by another daughter, Deborah Herschel, both of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.       
         Lita Annenberg Hazen, a major philanthropist in medical research whose interests encompassed art, music and education, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by complications from lung cancer, a grandson, Nicholas Polsky, said.         Mrs. Hazen had what her daughter, Cynthia Hazen Polsky, called "a great passion for family" and took a personal interest in the activities she supported. She was a friend of most of the scientists whose institutions she helped, and although she was rarely seen at the glittering social events favored by her peers, she had an active social life centered on the arts and science community.         "Medical discoveries were the most exciting and important things that she could imagine, and I don't remember her ever thinking differently or anything that competed with that," Mrs. Polsky said. "She always envisioned that someone would have a better answer."         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust played an important part in numerous medical and scientific programs on both coasts and made significant contributions to cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Opera.         The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island was one of Mrs. Hazen's principal interests. Hazen Tower, a building at the laboratory, commemorates her participation as a founding donor of its Neuroscience Center.         "Lita Hazen was a wonderful patron of pure science, who enjoyed bright and unusual people who would say things that she wouldn't expect," said Dr. James Watson, the Nobel laureate who is director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. .         Dr. Richard A. Lerner, president of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif, said: "She, like Mary Lasker, was one of the great ladies of American science. These kinds of individuals play important roles in science, far beyond the simple ability to donate money. In fact, they become a magnet around which scientists gather."         Dr. Lerner added, "We are losing our 'great ladies of science,' " and he noted that with their death and with no such new individuals on the horizon, "there will not be much to replace them, and a whole culture that fostered science will come to an end."         The Hazen Trust made possible the purchase of land for a science park at the institute and also financed a chair in immunochemistry. A three-building complex at the institute, to be dedicated on Oct. 15, was named in honor of Mrs. Hazen.         Mrs. Hazen was the sixth of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, who founded Triangle Publications and whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, the Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television interests. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom donated considerable portions of their inherited wealth to public institutions. Her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to Great Britain, is a major benefactor of art institutions, and a sister, Enid Haupt of New York, has devoted much of her fortune to public gardens and horticultural institutions, as well as museums and libraries.         In 1963, Mrs. Hazen was a founding sponsor of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, served as a trustee of its medical center from 1976 and contributed, with her siblings, to the construction of the 33-story Annenberg Building at the center, devoted to medical care, education and research. She also provided support for a neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Mount Sinai Medical Center that was named after her and, from 1979 to 1985, a $100,000 annual award for excellence in clinical research. The award, also named for her and administered by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, was divided between the winner and a young medical scientist chosen by the winner.         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Trust, created in 1952, also established significant scholarships and professorships at Mount Sinai, including the Moses L. and Sadie C. Annenberg Professorship in Molecular Biology, the Annenberg Scholarships in Cardiology and the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professorship in Immunochemistry.         Two grants of $1 million each helped establish and finance the Neurosciences Institute and Neurosciences Research Foundation at Rockefeller University in New York. The grants enabled multidisciplinary groups of scientists from around the world to meet and discuss their work. An atrium garden at the university was named in her honor.         In 1980, she initiated a biomedical workshop program at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and a fellowship that paid for the participation of scientists, physicians and administrators. The workshops were also held at other venues, in Stockholm, Venice and at the University of California at Los Angeles and at San Francisco.         Dr. Martin Meyerson, a former president of the University of Pennsylvania who was chairman of the workshops for a decade, noted that she insured that participants ranged from Nobel laureates to junior scientists and that "she relished providing a bit of luxury to them, a good dinner, putting them up in pleasant places."         Dr. Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton University who was a longtime friend, said: "She had a remarkable mind, and had she been born in another generation, she might well have done something herself. She understood what research was about, even in its beginning and theoretical stage."         Mrs. Hazen was born in Milwaukee on Oct. 30, 1909, and attended the Calhoun School in New York. In 1936, she married Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer, film producer, art collector and philanthropist at a double ceremony in which Mrs. Hazen's sister, Enid, was married to the investment banker Ira Haupt.         Mr. Hazen, a former vice president and director of Warner Brothers, wrote the contract between the studio and Edison Vitaphone that resulted in "The Jazz Singer," the first movie with sound. Later, he and Hal B. Wallis, the producer, became partners. Their company, Wallis-Hazen Productions, made films like "Come Back, Little Sheba," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" and "True Grit." During that period, the 1940's to 60's, Mrs. Hazen spent several months each year in Beverly Hills.         It was Mr. Hazen's admiration for Edward G. Robinson's collection of paintings that encouraged Mr. Hazen to become a collector and amass a considerable collection of 20th-century art, including work by Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Leger, Kandinsky, Braque and Picasso. The Joseph H. Hazen Foundation still contributes to a number of arts institutions.         "My mother's interest in art developed with her marriage to my father," Mrs. Polsky said. "My father was more passionate about art but my mother also loved museums and paintings. She was particularly interested in the Impressionists."         Mrs. Hazen's trust made sizable contributions to arts institutions, particularly the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In most cases, the trust provided the funds for purchases, among them two important South Indian bronzes, a 14th-century "Yashoda and Krishna" and an 11th-century "Shiva, Parvati and their son Skanda," for the museum's Irving Galleries of South and Southeast Asian Art.         Mrs. Hazen and her husband also established the Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratory in Oncology and Hematology, in memory of their other daughter, at the Marion Davies Hospital, a unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center. Mrs. Cherry died of lymphoma in 1965 at the age of 32.         Mr. Hazen died in 1994 at age 94, after 58 years of marriage. Mrs. Hazen is survived by Mrs. Polsky of Manhattan; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; a brother, Walter H. Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and three sisters, Mrs. Haupt, Janet Hooker and Evelyn Hall of Manhattan.         Correction:  October 4, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Lita Annenberg Hazen, a leading philanthropist in medical research, misstated her age in some editions. She was 85, not 86.       
         Before she made her Metropolitan Opera debut last Saturday in the title role  of Bizet's "Carmen," Denyce Graves kept telling herself that the Met was simply  another opera house. After all, she had already sung the role at the Vienna State Opera, at the Bastille Opera in Paris and at Covent Garden, 21 productions in the last two years alone.         "I tried to think of this as just another engagement," she said recently, "but nobody would let me do that."         She was referring not only to managers and the news media, but also to her family, friends and former teachers from the tough southwest Washington neighborhood where she grew up, a gritty area near a sewage treatment center and an automobile impoundment lot. More than 50 of her relatives and former neighbors traveled to New York by chartered bus for her Met debut; some 50 more  came by train and car.         For years, most people at home saw Ms. Graves as "some sort of space alien,"  she said, what with her exotic notions of becoming an opera singer. But "a Met debut was something they understood," she said, and the tumultuous standing ovation she got on Saturday night "really clinched it for them." She sings the role again this afternoon and on Wednesday and next Saturday.         Ms. Graves knows that her personal story is the kind of inspirational saga Americans love: a television crew from "60 Minutes" covered her Met debut. "This was not just a move for myself, but for my people, my family," the 30-year-old mezzo-soprano said. "I realize now that what I say affects my family, so I've become more protective of their feelings, my mother's in particular. It's not just my story; it's hers."         Ms. Graves was the second of three children. Her father, an alcoholic, abusive man, left the family when her mother was pregnant with their third child. The children did not see him for again for 18 years, when he turned up, unannounced, at the high school graduation of Ms. Graves's younger sister. By then he had become a minister. They have not heard from him since.         Left alone with three children to raise, Ms. Graves's mother found work as a  clerk-typist at the University of the District of Columbia. (Today, Mrs. Dorothy Graves Kenner, her name from a second marriage, is registrar.) She was out of the house before the children were up, and gone most of the day. "When she got home, we had to have dinner ready," Ms. Graves said. "We did the cooking, dishwashing and cleaning in rotating one-week shifts."         Yet her mother provided a rich, if regimented, family life. Participation in  their fundamentalist Baptist church was mandatory. Ms. Graves sang in the choir  and helped out at Sunday school. At home, her mother dedicated each night of the week to some educational project: one night the children would present oral book reports or speak on assigned topics (like birds, flowers or geography). Thursday was music night, when the family performed gospel as an impromptu vocal group at churches and meeting halls. Popular music of any kind was banned in the house, though Ms. Graves listened to some illicit Michael Jackson on the radio when she was alone. "My mother worked so hard," Ms. Graves said. "She didn't want her babies to be lost to the streets, like so many."         At school, Ms. Graves's singing was encouraged by a strong-willed music teacher, Judith Grove. "I adored her," Ms. Graves said. "I thought she hung the  moon." Ms. Grove directed her to the Duke Ellington School for the Performing Arts, a public high school in Washington. She was accepted immediately. There, she received private voice lessons and attended her first opera: a dress rehearsal for Beethoven's "Fidelio," on a school expedition to the Kennedy Center.         After high school, Ms. Graves made great progress under Helen Hodam, a renowned voice teacher, first at Oberlin Conservatory, and then at the New England Conservatory. In Boston, she took side jobs to support herself: cleaning dormitories, working as an all-night hotel desk clerk. When she decided to enter the Metropolitan Opera Regional Auditions, she had all the makings of a finalist: a lustrous mezzo-soprano voice and a striking stage presence. But her  performance was charged with a special determination. "I had to win," she said.  "I was four months behind in my rent. I couldn't pay for the rented dress I was wearing." Ms. Graves won.         The pressure took its toll. After the competition, her voice failed her. The  problem later turned out to be a treatable thyroid condition. But her performance at the finals in New York City was "a disaster," Ms. Graves said. Demoralized, she quit singing and took a secretarial job.         Yet the word of her promise had spread. The Houston Grand Opera called to invite her to participate in its program for young artists. She declined. When they called twice more, her friends prevailed on her to accept. ("It was a sign, like something meant to be," she said.)         Since then, her success has come steadily. One of her big supporters is Placido Domingo, who sang Don Jose to her Carmen at Covent Garden. They first met in Houston when Ms. Graves sang Emilia in a production of Verdi's "Otello."  "What impressed me immediately about her, aside from her obvious vocal and physical beauty, was an aura of the dramatic about her," Mr. Domingo said recently.         "As Carmen," he continued, "she is so good that the world might want her exclusively for this role. That would be a shame, because she has very much to offer in other parts." In his capacity as future artistic director of the Washington Opera, Mr. Domingo has invited her to sing two other leading roles, which have not yet been announced.         In developing her approach to this signature role, Ms. Graves avoided listening to recordings of celebrated Carmens from the past. Moreover, she counts herself lucky to have done her first Carmen in a modern-dress production  at the Minnesota Opera.         "I didn't want to do a traditional Carmen," she said. "Carmen is an unapologetic modern woman, a woman of the 90's. She speaks constantly about her  freedom, but she is no whore. Her spirit is free. She is attracted to Don Jose precisely because he isn't interested. When she realizes she truly loves him, she becomes afraid and treats him badly. Love means losing your freedom. I think she is essentially a very sad person."         Vocally, she finds the role gratifying, but frustrating. Unlike the other characters, Carmen has no defining "stand-and-deliver aria," as Ms. Graves put it, which makes portraying her true character a challenge. "Carmen sings songs,  but these are set pieces involving other people," she said. Carmen's most famous song, the "Habanera," is a "dramatic miscalculation," according to Ms. Graves, wrongly inserted by Bizet into the score after the premiere at the insistence of the first Carmen, Celestine Galli-Marie. "It's an awkward introduction to Carmen," Ms. Graves said. "In the original version, she enters, sings her few insinuating lines, then leaves, like a black cat crossing the stage. That's much more in character."         Her recent performances include Adalgisa in "Norma" at Zurich, Giulietta in "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" at La Scala, and Dalila in a concert performance of "Samson et Dalila" with the Chicago Symphony under James Levine. She is looking  forward to performing Marguerite in Berlioz's "Damnation of Faust" in Houston and Bonn ("I adore that music"), and hopes someday to sing Blanche in one of her favorites, Poulenc's "Dialogues of the Carmelites."         The sudden attention has left Ms. Graves excited but unaffected. Greeting a visitor in her hotel suite, she curled up on the couch in an oversize sweatshirt and casually stirred gobs of honey into her tea with a dinner knife when no teaspoon was handy. As she relaxed next to her husband, David Perry, an importer of fine classical guitars, she seemed content with the way her life has turned out.         "Perhaps this should be the last interview about the past," Mr. Perry suggested. "From now on, the future will be the story." Ms. Graves nodded quietly.       
         Maxene Andrews, "the one on the left" in the trio of sisters whose string of hit songs in the 1940's made them the dominant radio voice of the home front and an inspiration to American servicemen, died on Saturday at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack, said her longtime manager, Lynda Wells.  Miss Andrews had recently completed a four-week engagement playing herself in the revue "Swingtime Canteen" at the Blue Angel in New York. Ms. Wells said that Miss Andrews had agreed to return to the show in December.         Miss Andrews was a teen-ager when she, her older sister, LaVerne, who died in 1967, and her younger sister, Patty, formed the trio whose close-voiced, enthusiastic style became the vocal parallel of the big bands of the swing era. They became stars almost overnight in 1937, singing English lyrics to the Yiddish song "Bei Mir Bist du Schon."         That success started the sisters on a long series of novelty hits that included "Ti-Pi-Tin," "Hold Tight," "The Jumping Jive," "Beer Barrel Polka," "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy" and "Apple Blossom Time."         "The Beer Barrel Polka" was followed by "The Pennsylvania Polka" and "Strip Polka," while "Rhumboogie" started them on a series of boogie-woogie hits that included "Beat Me, Daddy, Eight to the Bar" and "Boogie-Woogie Bugle Boy."         Their big hits during World War II were "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree" and "Rum and Coca-Cola."         To a nation at war, the Andrews Sisters became a cherished American institution. They could be heard on the radio, on jukeboxes and on movie soundtracks. They made numerous appearances at war bond rallies and they entertained troops, who seemed to regard them as the epitome of American innocence.         The innocence may have been even more authentic than it seemed. Miss Andrews said it was not until years later that she learned that the sly references to "working for the Yankee dollar" in "Rum and Coca-Cola" were suggestive of prostitution in Trinidad.         One of their few ballad hits was the song "I'll Be With You in Apple Blossom Time," which was recorded in 1940 and became Miss Andrews's personal favorite.         The sisters' singing style came naturally to them. "We couldn't read music," Maxene once explained. "But when we heard a song, we heard it in harmony."         Maxene, known as Mackie to her family and friends, was born on Jan. 3, 1916. She organized the trio in 1932, when she was 16. LaVerne was 21 and had been studying piano, while Patty, 14, was the tap-dance champion of Minneapolis, where the sisters were born. From the start, LaVerne was the low voice, Maxene the high voice and Patty the one in between.         From the late 1930's until the early 1940's, the Andrews Sisters sold more than 50 million records, appeared as themselves in 22 films and frequently teamed with Bing Crosby and Glenn Miller on their radio shows.         Although the public always saw the three sisters together, singing in close harmony, their private lives were studded with fallings-out. The group broke up in the early 1950's when Patty decided to become a solo performer. Maxene made her own debut as a solo act at that time at the Blue Angel but canceled after a few nights because she was still thinking in harmony terms. The sisters came together again very soon, however, and remained together until LaVerne's death.         In 1970 Maxene accepted the position of dean of women at Tahoe Paradise College in Lake Tahoe, Calif.         "I laughed when I was offered the position," she said. "All my life I'd been in show business. My schooling was the school of experience. But I had great rapport with young students."         In 1974 Maxene and Patty made their Broadway debuts in "Over Here." The show ran for more than a year, but after it closed, the two never sang together again.         Although they made a joint publicity appearance in 1987 when an Andrews Sisters star was added to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, the two remained estranged, Ms. Wells said yesterday.         In recent years Miss Andrews had pursued an almost full-time career, lecturing, performing in concerts and at nightclubs and, more recently, in musicals. Earlier this year she appeared in "Follies," in Houston and Seattle.         Miss Andrews's marriage to Lou Levy, who managed the sister act, ended in divorce in 1951.         In addition to her sister, of Encino, Calif., Miss Andrews is survived by a daughter, Aleda Hunt, and a son, Peter Levy, both of Salt Lake City; by Ms. Wells, whom she adopted and who lived with her in Auburn, Calif.; Steve Sharpe of Los Angeles, whom she considered a foster son, and one grandchild.         Correction:  October 25, 1995, Wednesday         Subheadings for obituaries on Monday about the singer Maxene Andrews and the writer Kingsley Amis were reversed in some copies. The reference to "a onetime radical" applied to the obituary of Mr. Amis; the one to a "last role" in "a Manhattan revue" was for Miss Andrews's.       
         Leila Mourad, an Egyptian singer and actress who rose to fame in the 1940's and 50's, died on Tuesday, Egyptian newspapers reported today. She was 77.         They said the Jewish-born actress -- who withdrew from the limelight after a  career spanning 39 years -- died of heart failure.         Ms. Mourad's vibrant voice and glamorous on-screen roles dazzled Middle Eastern audiences during the heyday of Egyptian cinema. She retired in 1969 after performing in more than 28 films and recording about 1,000 songs.         The actress, who converted to Islam in the 1940's, is survived by a son, Zaky Fateen Abdel Wahab.       
         Florence Greenberg, a one-time New Jersey housewife who parlayed an unlikely  hit record by a teen-age group known as the Shirelles into an improbable career  as the proprietor of a leading independent label of the 1960's, died on Thursday at the Hackensack University Medical Center. She was 82, and lived in Teaneck, N.J.         As a pioneering woman in the male-dominated world of rhythm-and-blues, Mrs. Greenberg was, by her own later account, a triple anomaly: "a white woman who was in a black business and who couldn't carry a tune."         Maybe so, but she had a finely tuned ear for popular music, a keen eye for talent and a driving ambition, all of which became increasingly apparent in the  1960's.         In addition to a series of hits by the Shirelles, among them "Dedicated to the One I Love," "Tonight's the Night," and Mrs. Greenberg's own composition, "Soldier Boy," her Scepter label produced such 1960's standards as "Louie, Louie," by the Kingsmen; "Twist and Shout," by the Isley Brothers, and "Walk on  By," by Dionne Warwick, not to mention "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head," the  Burt Bacharach-Hal David song, sung by B. J. Thomas on the soundtrack of "Butch  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," which won an Academy Award in 1969.         Mrs. Greenberg traced her success to a day in 1957 when her 16-year-old daughter, Mary Jane, came home raving about the performance of four classmates at a Passaic High School assembly.         Their names were Shirley Alston, Addie Harris, Doris Kenner and Beverly Lee,  but they called themselves the Shirelles, and as soon as Mrs. Greenberg persuaded them to sing for her, she knew that their song, "I Met Him on a Sunday," had the makings of a hit.         A former Republican campaign worker who had translated her political skills into a job peddling songs for a local songwriters, Mrs. Greenberg, who had been  married to an accountant, had already become a familiar figure on Tin Pan Alley, hobnobbing with music-industry hopefuls at the old Turf restaurant on Broadway at 51st Street. She had also joined with two partners to form a label, Tiara Records.         The Tiara release of "I Met Him on a Sunday" was such an immediate success. Within months, Mrs.  Greenberg climbed so many radio-station stairs, sold so many records from the trunk of her car and created such demand that her company  could not handle the orders. So she sold the Shirelles' contract to Decca, an industry giant.         That might have been the end of her career, but, Decca, convinced that the Shirelles would be a one-hit phenomenon, returned the group to Mrs. Greenberg, who formed Scepter to replace Tiara.         Over the next decade, Scepter became an industry sensation as Mrs. Greenberg, whose company eventually occupied an entire floor of 1650 Broadway, repeatedly demonstrated her sure sense of talent.         This was never more evident than the day in 1962 when Mr. Bacharach played a  demonstration record of one of his songs for Mrs. Greenberg, and she told him that while she did not like the song she loved the singer.         The next day, Mr. Bacharach returned, saying he had a signed contract with the singer, a young woman named Dionne Warwick.         Partly because of the long line of hit Warwick releases that followed, Gulf & Western offered $6 million for Scepter in 1965, but Mrs. Greenberg declined to sell.         It was, she later said, a major mistake. Within a decade, as major labels came to dominate the distribution network, Scepter's success had faded, and by the time the company folded in 1977 Mrs. Greenberg had lost everything.         In recent years, Mrs. Greenberg had been cheered by Bette Midler's plans to make a movie of her life, but because Ms. Midler has been unable to secure the required rights from two of the three surviving Shirelles (Ms. Harris died in 1982), the project is dormant.         She is survived by her daughter, Mary Jane Goff of Upper Saddle River, N.J.;  a son, Stanley, of Los Angeles; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Vivian Blaine, who created the role of the ditsy "well-known fiancee" Miss Adelaide in the original production of "Guys and Dolls," died on Saturday at Beth Israel Medical Center North in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Claire Chapman, a friend.         Guys and Dolls," the Frank Loesser and Abe Burrows musical based on stories by Damon Runyon, was the sensation of the 1950 Broadway season, and Ms. Blaine was irresistible as the blond chanteuse at the Hot Box club who was hopelessly engaged to Nathan Detroit (Sam Levene), the operator of the "oldest established  permanent floating crap game in New York."         Ms. Blaine sang "A Bushel and a Peck," "Take Back Your Mink" and "Adelaide's  Lament," which with its refrain "a person could develop a cold," routinely brought the house down. "Sung in the squeaky, nasal New Yorkese that characterizes Adelaide, the Lament is an unforgettable show stopper," Collier's  magazine wrote in 1951. "Night after night, the house listens to Adelaide's complaints in an exhilarated hush."         Ms. Blaine was born in Newark. Originally her last name was Stapleton. While  she was still in elementary school, her father, a theatrical agent, booked $1-a-night singing dates for her at nightclubs, company parties and police benefits. At 14 she began singing with the Halsey Miller Orchestra, and after graduating from Southside High School went on the road with little-known bands.         In 1941, when she was singing at the Governor Clinton Hotel in Manhattan, her picture appeared in a newspaper, and a talent scout for 20th Century Fox invited her to take a screen test. Darryl F. Zanuck, the head of the studio, liked what  he saw and signed her to a contract.         Initially, Ms. Blaine languished. She was assigned some small parts and, after performing on the U.S.O. circuit, appeared in "Jitterbugs" (1943) with Laurel and Hardy. After storming into Zanuck's office and threatening to quit, she won a lead role in the musical "Greenwich Village" (1944). With an eye to the new Technicolor process, the studio dyed her blond hair red and promoted her as "the cherry blonde."         Her films of the 40's were limited to forgettable musicals like "Something for the Boys" (1944), "Doll Face" (1945), "Three Little Girls in Blue" (1946) and "If I'm Lucky" (1945). She did better as Joan Bennett's rival for George Raft in "Nob Hill" (1945) and as the dance-band singer Emily in the Rodgers and  Hammerstein musical "State Fair" (1945).         Ms. Blaine won the role of Adelaide by chance. Cy Feuer and Ernest Martin, the producers of "Guys and Dolls," had turned her down for the part of Sarah Brown, the Mission Doll, telling her that her personality was too strong for the ingenue role. As luck would have it, she ran into the two men several months later on Broadway, at a time when they were having casting problems. A hasty audition was arranged, and Ms. Blaine won the part.         At first it wasn't much, just a few lines of dialogue attached to two songs.  At one point, Ms. Blaine considered dropping out of the production in frustration. "That part was virtually written as the play was rehearsed," said Manny Franks, her husband and agent, in a 1952 interview. "Vivian would suggest  things she had thought out for Miss Adelaide to do. Before long Miss Adelaide became one of the strongest elements in the show, simply because an actress had  put her mind to making something out of nothing."         Ms. Blaine played Adelaide for five years, with a brief interruption to make  the movie musical "Skirts Ahoy." She also played the role in the 1955 film version by Metro Goldwyn Mayer, with Frank Sinatra as Nathan Detroit in a cast that also included Marlon Brando and Jean Simmons. She played the role once more in a 1966 revival of the musical.         She appeared on Broadway in "A Hatful of Rain" (1956), replacing Shelley Winters; "Say, Darling" (1958), "Enter Laughing" (1963), "Company" (1971) and, briefly, "Zorba" (1984).         From 1951 to 1952 she appeared on television in "Those Two," a musical situation comedy with Pinky Lee. She also had roles in the films "Public Pigeon  No. 1" (1957), "Richard" (1972), "The Dark" (1979)" and "Parasite" (1982).         Ms. Blaine was married three times. The marriages ended in divorce.       
         Nancy LaMott, a cabaret singer and recording artist whose unadorned, heartfelt interpretations of songs epitomized the best of what could be called an all-American style of traditional pop singing, died on Wednesday at St. Luke's Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 43.         The cause was cancer, said her manager, Scott Barnes.         In the last two years, Ms. LaMott had achieved a national reputation, and her recently released fifth album, "Listen to My Heart" (Midder Music), recorded with the arranger Peter Matz, received critical acclaim. In a cabaret field typified by showy histrionics, Ms. LaMott was a singularly unaffected voice. She brought to everything she sang a clean, clear sense of line, impeccable enunciation and a deep understanding of how a good song could convey a lifetime's experience.         Ms. LaMott, born in Midland, Mich., was a self-taught musician who began singing with her father's band in her hometown. In the late 1970's, she moved to San Francisco, where she sang at the Plush Room and other local clubs. Arriving  in New York in the early 1980's, she worked as a cocktail waitress and a singer  at the Duplex and Don't Tell Mama. She also did demonstration records of theater songs by composers like Alan Menken, Marvin Hamlisch and Cy Coleman. In 1983, she was featured in the cabaret revue "It's Better With a Band," a show at Don't Tell Mama that featured the lyrics of David Zippel. The next year, she teamed up with Christopher Marlowe, who became her longtime accompanist and musical director.         In 1990, she met the composer David Friedman and his companion, Mr. Barnes, who became her manager. Together with Mr. Zippel they produced her first album,  "Beautiful Baby," in 1991. Four more recordings followed. For her second album,  "Come Rain or Come Shine: The Songs of Johnny Mercer" (1993), she was named best female vocalist by the Manhattan Association of Cabarets. The following year, her third album, "My Foolish Heart," was chosen record of the year by the same organization. Her fourth album, a holiday collection, "Just in Time for Christmas," was released a year ago.         Ms. LaMott was plagued with illness for much of her life. At 17, she was diagnosed with Crohn's disease, an ulcerative intestinal disorder. An operation  in 1993 reversed many of her symptoms and allowed her recording and singing career to blossom. In addition to her recordings, she made television appearances on "Good Morning America," "Live With Regis and Kathie Lee," "Today" and "The Charles Grodin Show."         She is survived by her husband, Peter Zapp, an actor whom she married on her  deathbed; by her parents, Judy and Jack LaMott, and three brothers and three sisters.       
         Roxie Roker, a star of the long-running CBS television series "The Jeffersons," died on Saturday, her publicity agent said. She was 66.         Her family, including her son, Lenny Kravitz, the rock guitarist and singer,  declined to release further details, said the publicity agent, Cynthia Snyder.         Ms. Roker was born in Miami. She grew up in Brooklyn, earned a drama degree  from Howard University in Washington and studied at the Shakespeare Institute in Stratford-on-Avon, England. While holding an office job at NBC in New York in the 1960's, she appeared in Off Broadway shows, including Jean Genet's play "The Blacks." In 1967-68, she was a host of "Inside Bedford-Stuyvesant," a community-oriented show on WNEW-TV.         After resigning from NBC and turning full time to acting, Ms. Roker appeared  onstage with the Negro Ensemble Company in "Ododo" and "Rosalee Pritchet." She won an Obie Award, and was a 1974 Tony nominee for her performance as Mattie Williams in "The River Niger." Her other Off Broadway credits include "Behold! Cometh the Vanderkellans" (1971) and "Jamimma" (1972).         Ms. Roker moved to California when the producer Norman Lear cast her in "The  Jeffersons," a 1975 spinoff of his series "All in the Family." The new show moved Archie Bunker's black neighbors, the Jeffersons, from a blue-collar Queens neighborhood to a luxury apartment house in Manhattan.         The character played by Ms. Roker, Helen Willis, was a black woman with a white husband, Tom (Franklin Cover), television's first interracial couple. They were neighbors of George and Louise Jefferson (Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford), and the Willises' daughter eventually married the Jeffersons' son, Lionel. "The Jeffersons" ran for 10 years.         Ms. Roker later made guest appearances in other television series and specials and returned to the stage. She appeared in a stage production of "The Jeffersons" and toured with Mary Martin and Carol Channing in "Legends."         Her community work, including her role as a board member of the Interagency Council on Child Abuse and Neglect, earned her two citations from the Los Angeles City Council.         A marriage to Sy Kravitz, a former NBC executive, ended in divorce, said a spokesman for Virgin Records, their son's recording company.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her father, Albert Roker, and a granddaughter, Zoe.       
         Berenice Bramson, a soprano who received critical acclaim throughout her career, died on Thursday at her home in Katonah, N.Y. She was 65.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bramson was a native of Omaha. She studied at the Juilliard School of Music and Columbia University before making her solo debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1953. In a review for The New York Times, Ross Parmenter wrote that Ms. Bramson had provided "an absorbing evening of music" and that she "sang with distinction."         Twenty years later, after another recital, Peter G. Davis wrote in The Times: "Very rarely does an unheralded singer stand comparison with international superstars. Berenice Bramson can match talents with any soprano recitalist before the public today."         Ms. Bramson made her operatic debut in 1976 as Lisa in Tchaikovsky's "Queens of Spades" with the Vancouver Opera Company. She also appeared with the New York Grand Opera and the Brooklyn Opera Company. For more than 40 years, she taught voice at her studio in Katonah and several colleges. She gave her last solo recital in New York at Weill Recital Hall in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, Alan; a daughter, Bobbe Dodge of Ossining, N.Y.; a son, Steven of Los Angeles, and two sisters, Belle Lipsett of Kensington, Calif., and Pearl Jacobson of Davis, Calif.       
         Selena, the 23-year-old reigning queen of the Tejano music world, was shot and killed today at a Corpus Christi motel.         Shortly after 9:30 P.M. a 32-year-old woman identified by the young singer's father as the former president of her fan club abruptly surrendered after keeping the police at bay for nearly 10 hours as she sat in a red pickup truck in the motel parking lot with a gun pointed at her temple.         Hundreds of people who had congregated in the cold drizzle watched as she was rushed off in a police car, surrounded by officers.         The killing of the star, who had won a Grammy music award last year and whose recording "Amor Prohibido" ("Forbidden Love") sold 400,000 copies in the United States and many more than that in Mexico, stunned her fans and prompted almost non-stop coverage on Spanish-language radio and television stations here, in Texas's major cities and all along the Mexican border. Many of the stations took calls from distraught listeners and played Selena's songs throughout the day.         The surrender came in a surreal scene with a crowd of reporters, television camera operators and onlookers gathered at an Exxon gas station across the street from the Days Inn motel just off a stretch of Interstate 37 near the Corpus Christi airport. Hundreds of fans, including many weeping teen-agers, converged on the scene throughout the day, a few with tape machines that played recordings of Selena's songs as reporters' beepers and cellular phones rang almost constantly.         Police identified the suspect as Yolanda Saldivar and said they would charge her on Saturday. The singer's father, Abraham Quintanilla, said Ms. Saldivar was a former head of the Selena fan club who three weeks ago was fired from her job at the family's clothing boutique here, Selena, Etc. The stores are due to expand to San Antonio and Mexico in coming months.         "There have been discrepancies," Mr. Quintanilla told reporters at the hospital where his daughter died this afternoon, two hours after she was shot. "And they resulted in her shooting Selena."         Mr. Quintanilla described Ms. Saldivar as a "disgruntled employee" who was fired after money was discovered to be missing from the store. He said that Selena had demanded that the woman return financial documents about the company and that the two women had agreed to meet at the motel.         With her pouting smile, suggestive clothing and theatrical command of a microphone, Selena was often described as the Madonna of the Mexican-American world and was an idol and heartthrob on both sides of the border. Unlike Madonna, though, she also cultivated an image as a cheerful promoter of family values. She was married to Chris Perez, the lead guitarist in her band, Selena y los Dinos.         Tejano music, which has roots both in the oompah music of European settlers in Texas and in Mexican ballads, is a fast-paced mix of accordion, guitars and lyrics in both English and Spanish.         It is hugely popular in South Texas and elsewhere along the border. The recent Tejano Music Awards in San Antonio, which has become a sort of Nashville of the Tejano world, was attended by 45,000 fans. At the ceremonies, Selena walked away with awards for female entertainer of the year, female vocalist of the year, best record of the year and best album. Her "Selena Live" also won the Grammy last year for best Mexican-American album.         "It's got polka in it, a little bit of country, a little bit of jazz," she said in an interview last year with the San Jose Mercury News. "Fuse all those types of music together. I think that's where you get Tejano."         Selena's hit "Fotos y Recuerdos" ("Photographs and Memories") is No. 4 on Billboard Magazine's Latin chart this week.         An assistant police chief in Corpus Christi, Ken Bung, said that Selena, whose full name was Selena Quintanilla Perez, was shot in a room at the motel just before noon and stumbled to the lobby. She was rushed to the Memorial Medical Center and pronounced dead about an hour later.         Born in Lake Jackson, near Houston, on April 16, 1971, Selena began singing with her father's band at age 3. The family later moved to Corpus Christi where she became well-known in local music circles by her teen-age years and eventually became a widely known star.         At the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, a traditional celebration that turns America's fourth-largest city into a cowtown once a year, Selena was the largest-selling draw this year.         "We had 20 performances this year," said Leroy Shafer, assistant general manager of the show. "We had Reba McEntire, George Strait, Clint Black and Vince Gill. She had the highest-selling show concert at our show this year, at 61,041 in the Astrodome."         A concert video made of her performance is to air shortly in Mexico and on some Spanish-language stations in Texas.         Maria Aguirre, a receptionist at KQQK, a popular Tejano music station in Houston, said the switchboard had been flooded with calls since the death was first announced.         "Basically they are just in awe," Ms. Aguirre said. "They cannot believe that it happened. They're calling to reconfirm."         For Tejano fans, she added, "It's almost like the feeling when John Lennon died. She was the queen of Tejano."         Mr. Shafer said: "This lady was destined to be an international superstar. In many aspects she already was. She could sell out any pavilion in South Texas. She was on her way to standing beside Madonna."         In Mexico, her popularity was limited more to the northern border region, within what Mexicans call the onda grupera, or "group wave," a movement of norteno or "ranchera" pop groups that travel the northern and central states of the country, playing dances in the towns and concerts in the cities.         Selena's father had toured nightclubs across Texas in the 1960's with the original version of Los Dinos but did not achieve wide success until he made young Selena, with her belting vocal power, the lead singer. "I think he saw dollar signs," Selena said laughingly in an interview last year, describing the evolution of a family band that included her sister Suzette on drums and her brother Abraham III on guitar.         Industry experts estimated that the shooting would only ripen Selena's celebrity as the Tejano queen who was about to break through to a larger public with her first English language album as well as her first movie role in the forthcoming "Don Juan DeMarco."         "That album was going to open a lot of doors," said John Ortiz, promotion representative for EMI Latin Records. "It will be a great loss. Shewas involved in many things."       
         Tessie O'Shea, a Tony-winning music-hall singer and actress with a bouncy stage personality that cheerfully capitalized on her girth, died yesterday at a nursing home in Leesburg, Fla. She was 82 and lived in East Lake Weir, Fla.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Kathleen Wampola, a friend.         Miss O'Shea was born in Cardiff, Wales, where her father was a newsdealer, and began singing and dancing as a child. She went on her first music-hall tour at the age of 7 and three years later, after appearing in a starring role at the Bristol Hippodrome, she toured variety theaters throughout Britain. At 15, while singing as a summer replacement in a Blackpool revue, she performed "Two-Ton Tessie from Tennessee," a song that became her anthem. "I've always been fat, but I'm limber," she once told a newspaper reporter.         Ms. O'Shea was a headliner with such British revues as "On With the Show" and "High Time," which went to the London Palladium in the 1940's. Such was her fame that in 1944, a limousine picked her up after a show at the Palladium and whisked her to Windsor Castle, where she sang for Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret. She performed for British and American troops during the war, and when it ended she produced "Tessie's Big Show" and "Tess and Bill," which became a BBC radio series.         She also appeared in several British films, including "The Way Ahead" (1945) in which she played herself, "London Town" (1946) and "The Shiralee" (1957).         Miss O'Shea made her stage debut in the United States in 1963 as a Cockney fish-and-chips peddler in the musical "The Girl Who Came to Supper." Her 12 minutes onstage, singing a medley of four songs by Noel Coward, was a show-stopper that won her a Tony Award that year as best supporting actress. It also led to appearances on the Ed Sullivan and "Tonight" shows. She was a regular on the CBS variety series "The Entertainers" in 1964. In 1969, she received an Emmy nomination for her role as a music-hall entertainer in "Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde."         Miss O'Shea appeared in the Broadway shows "A Time for Singing" (1966), "Something's Afoot" (1976) and the flop "Broadway Follies" (1981). In the film "The Russians Are Coming, the Russians Are Coming," she played a prim Bostonian telephone operator. She also appeared in the film "Bedknobs and Broomsticks" (1971).         No immediate family members survive.
