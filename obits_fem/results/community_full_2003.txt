         Celia Stein, a co-founder of The Riverdale Press, died on Jan. 11 at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 90.         Mrs. Stein and her husband, David A. Stein, who died in 1982, founded The Press in their living room in 1950 as a weekly community newsletter, and she remained a member of its management until her death. She also contributed a chronicle of community events and a recipe column, Ceil Selects.         Family-run, The Press now has a paid circulation of about 13,000. It won a 1998 Pulitzer Prize for editorials about schools and other local issues, written by its editor and co-publisher, Mrs. Stein's son Bernard L. Stein.         Celia Leikind was born in Cleveland and graduated from Case Western Reserve University. She came to New York in 1944 with her husband. At the paper, she advanced from society editor to women's editor to co-publisher.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Stein's survivors include another son, Richard L., co-publisher of The Press; three grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.       
         Amy Bess Williams Miller, who helped found Hancock Shaker Village, a restoration of a former Shaker community and a museum, died on Sunday at her home in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 90.         Mrs. Miller, an expert on the Shaker religious movement, was president of Hancock Shaker Village Inc. from 1959 to 1990. The museum and historic site on the border between Pittsfield and Hancock contains many pieces of Shaker handiwork, including Shaker furniture that Mrs. Miller donated.         She also raised funds and directed the restoration of the site, which had been a Shaker community for a century. The Shaker movement, named for the pious trembling of its members, began in 1747 in Britain as a celibate offshoot of the Quakers.         She began her work shortly before the Shakers ended the settlement in 1960, a century after Shakerism had begun to decline, leaving behind more than 12 buildings. At one time, it appeared that a nearby racetrack would acquire the buildings. But a group of Pittsfielders bought them from the remaining Shakers.         Mrs. Miller's writings include ''Shaker Medicinal Herbs: A Compendium of History, Lore, and Uses'' (1998, Storey in association with Hancock Shaker Village).         A doctor's daughter, Amy Bess Williams was born in El Paso and grew up in Worcester, Mass. She graduated from Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield and studied at the Sorbonne.         Her husband, Lawrence K. Miller, who was editor and publisher of The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, died in 1991, after 58 years of marriage,         Her survivors include a daughter, Margo Miller of Boston; three sons, Kelton II, of Shaftsbury, Vt., and Michael and Mark, both of Pittsfield; a sister, Margery Adams of Charlotte, N.C.; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Celine G. Marcus, former executive director of the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association, an East Side social services organization, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 93.         She retired in 1982 after 12 years as the association's executive director and 11 years as assistant to the director.         She spent those 23 years helping to create a network of social services in the association's neighborhood, from 59th to 96th Streets and Fifth Avenue to the East River.         She became the head of a staff of 255, 180 of them volunteers, and addressed problems including crime, truancy, loneliness and aging. The organization is now called the Lenox Hill Neighborhood House.         In 1980, she was a founder of the Neighborhood Coalition for Shelter, which works to provide shelter and other help for Manhattan's homeless.         She was on the boards of the Yorkville Civic Center and several other groups.         In 1983 she was one of the first five winners of the Family of New York Awards, fostered by former Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.         She and her co-winners were honored for helping to establish a community shelter for homeless women. They also led efforts to aid homeless men at a city-run shelter in the Seventh Regiment Armory, at Park Avenue and 66th Street.         Born in Brooklyn, Celine Greenebaum graduated from Barnard. Her social-services career began on the Lower East Side in the Depression and lasted more than 50 years.         Her husband, Joshua Marcus, died in 1988. She is survived by two daughters, Ann Marcus of Manhattan and Dorothy Marcus of the Bronx; a son, Daniel, of Washington; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and two sisters, Marion Epstein of Princeton, N.J., and Helen Joffe of Rochester.       
         Janet Collins, prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House in the early 1950's and one of a very few black women to become prominent in American classical ballet, died on Wednesday in Fort Worth. She was 86 and lived there.         Ms. Collins taught dance, choreographed, performed on Broadway and in film and appeared frequently on television. But she was best known as the exquisitely beautiful dancer who was the first black artist to perform at the Metropolitan, four years before Marian Anderson sang there.         ''She was a great inspiration to me as a child in Trinidad,'' the dancer and painter Geoffrey Holder said. ''What she did by dancing the way she did -- to be prima ballerina at the Metropolitan Opera House -- gave everybody hope.''         Ms. Collins made her New York debut in 1949, dancing in her own choreography on a shared program at the 92nd Street Y. John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, described her as ''the most exciting young dancer who has flashed across the current scene in a long time,'' calling her style an eclectic mix of modern dance and ballet.         ''There is a wonderful sense of aliveness in the dancer's presence and in her moving,'' Martin wrote. ''She is not self-absorbed, but is dancing completely and wholesouledly for an audience. On the other hand, there is no air of showing off about it, no coyness or coquetry, but only an apparent desire to establish and maintain a communicative contact.'' He praised her for the sharp, clean precision, ''the piquant tang, the arresting mental vigor'' of her dancing and choreography.         Ms. Collins's next triumph came the following year on Broadway in the Cole Porter musical ''Out of This World.'' Playing the role of Night, she danced an airborne solo created for her by Hanya Holm. She went from there to the Metropolitan, where she appeared as a principal dancer.         She performed lead roles in ''Aida,'' ''Carmen,'' the Dance of the Hours in ''La Gioconda'' and the Bacchanale in ''Samson and Delilah.''         It was not until two decades after she left the Met, however, that she was to receive major attention again in New York when, in 1974, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater paid homage to her and Pearl Primus as pioneering black women in dance.         Born in New Orleans, Ms. Collins moved with her family to Los Angeles at age 4.         She received her first dance training at a Catholic community center and went on to study primarily with Carmelita Maracci, one of the few ballet teachers who accepted black students, and with Lester Horton and Adolph Bolm.         She auditioned in Los Angeles for the Ballet Russe but said she had been told that she would either have to have special roles created for her or dance in white face.         ''I said no,'' she told Anna Kisselgoff in a 1974 interview in The Times. ''I sat on the steps and I cried and cried.'' But the rejection spurred her, she said, to work even harder, hard enough to be an exception.         Ms. Collins danced with Katherine Dunham and performed with the Dunham company in the 1943 film musical ''Stormy Weather.''         She also danced a solo choreographed by Jack Cole in the 1946 film ''The Thrill of Brazil,'' and worked with the filmmaker Maya Deren.         She toured with Talley Beatty in a nightclub act that was sometimes billed as Rea and Rico De Gard to prevent speculation about the two light-skinned dancers' race.         Ms. Collins was most active during the 1950's, when she toured with her own dance group throughout the United States and Canada and taught at academies including the School of American Ballet, affiliated with the New York City Ballet; Harkness House; and the San Francisco Ballet School.         Ms. Collins is survived by a brother, Earnest, of Fort Worth, and a sister, Betty Wilkerson of Pasadena, Calif.         Correction:  June 7, 2003, Saturday  An obituary last Saturday about Janet Collins, a former prima ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera House, misstated the precedent for black artists there. Louis Armstrong, Billie Holiday and several other performers at a jazz concert in 1944 were the first; Ms. Collins first appeared in 1951.       
         IN the eye of the festive hurricane that is the annual Caribbean parade on Labor Day, that soca-blaring, steel-drum-banging, sequins-and-feathers annual cavalcade down Eastern Parkway in Brooklyn, sits a not-a-bit ruffled Yolanda Lezama-Clark, R.N.         No, she is not the medical officer, though as a nursing administrator at Elmhurst Hospital in Queens, surely she could step in and do that, too.         Mrs. Lezama-Clark is the efficient, soft-spoken center of it all, the president of the West Indian American Day Carnival Association, which for 36 years has organized what has become New York City's largest parade.         Think of it as organizing a party for a couple of million people, with 500 vendors selling everything from commemorative T-shirts to curried goat, and entertainment by two dozen bands and music groups riding flatbed trucks with speakers the size of refrigerators. Don't forget to plan for 65 fanciful floats. And the likes of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg -- he wants to be trailed by a band truck so he can march to music -- and Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton (the honorary grand marshal) have R.S.V.P.'d yes.         ''People ask me, 'How do you do it? How do you just maintain calm?' '' Mrs. Lezama-Clark said the other afternoon, a soft Trinidadian lilt spicing her voice. ''It's my personality, you know. What can I tell you? I have always been very low key. Both of my parents were very hyper people. To me it was like, why do we all have to be that way? Somebody has to maintain the calm.''         She spoke while sitting at her thoroughly uncluttered desk in the association's two-room storefront office at 325 Rogers Avenue, a few blocks off Eastern Parkway between a bodega and an evangelical church. Around her a dozen people bustled in and out, some sorting papers and packages of information for the various events preceding the parade, checking vendor lists and forms, and tending to the never-ending file of people calling for last-minute applications and instructions.         A calypso tune played softly on a radio; highlights of past parades flickered from a television. As if still presiding over everything, a large print of Mrs. Lezama-Clark's father, Carlos Lezama, the founder of the parade, who stepped down from the association presidency two years ago, looked down from the wall.         Mrs. Lezama-Clark kept one eye on her visitor and the other on the whirl around her.         ''We have a theme for the parade -- wait,'' she interrupted herself. ''Is that Mary's voice? Mary?'' It was, and Mrs. Lezama-Clark dashed off for urgent business.         THE theme, by the way, is ''Share the belief and strengthen the vision.'' It represents the direction in which she wants to take the association, to become more active in voter registration and community health.         The parade isn't enough?         ''If you want it to be a year-round organization, you can't just focus on Labor Day weekend,'' she said.         She does like to think big. Consider that she also wants to bring order to a parade whose freewheeling fun has gotten out of hand in the past. Four years ago, two 11-year-old children died when they were struck by vehicles along the parade route, and a teenager died afterward after being hit by a parade sound truck.         Mrs. Lezama-Clark has hired a private security force, a first for the parade, and has put in place route changes and other measures to help keep the procession moving and bring more sense to the order of march. The slow pace -- it runs from 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. -- and herky-jerky movement has led to reduced television coverage, she said.         Mrs. Lezama-Clark is also pushing participants to keep it traditional, encouraging band members to lose the T-shirts and jeans in favor of the colorful costumes of Carnival.         ''Carnival is about music, it's about color and pageantry. It's not about T-shirts.''         Yes, Mrs. Lezama-Clark has a no-nonsense air, but she does not wish to rain on the parade, which happens a lot anyway. After all, she used to dance in it as a young girl, decked out in pink sequins, and has the snapshots to prove it. She favors calypso, which spills from her car radio on the drive home, often at 2 a.m., to Westbury, N.Y.         She spent her early years in Trinidad, coming to New York when she was 8. She won't reveal her age but does allow that she graduated from Brooklyn College in 1978, going into computer programming afterward and raising two daughters -- now 27 and 16 -- with her husband, Michael. Bored with programming, she eventually switched careers to nursing and is now studying for a master's degree.         The parade, though, has always been central in her life. She used to do the filing, run errands, answer the phone at 4 a.m. It was, and still is, she says, an almost spiritual fulfillment.         ''There is a magnetism around Carnival where you feel that if you are not there you really feel you are missing out on something,'' she said. ''You go through basic withdrawal. I do, come Trinidad Carnival, and I'm here in the cold and I know there is a lot going on down there.''         With all this running around, does she actually get to enjoy the parade?         ''Who, me?         ''No, I tend to enjoy it from the reviewing stand; you know, when the music pass and I see the people enjoying themselves,'' she said, looking a bit dejected. ''I tend to move as well but that's about the extent of it because I am tired by the end of the weekend.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Joan B. Kroc, a prominent philanthropist, a former owner of the San Diego Padres and the widow of Ray A. Kroc, the founder and chairman of the McDonald's Corporation, died on Sunday at her home in Rancho Santa Fe, Calif. She was 75. The cause was brain cancer, a spokesman said.         In 1998, Ms. Kroc gave $100 million to the Salvation Army to build and endow the Ray and Joan Kroc Community Center in San Diego and $25 million to the University of San Diego to establish its Institute for Peace and Justice. In the 1980's she gave $19 million to the University of Notre Dame to endow an institute for international peace studies.         Through foundations and in her own name, she also gave major gifts for AIDS research, hospice care, environmental causes, nuclear disarmament and programs to combat drug and alcohol abuse and hunger. In 1987, she became the first person to give the Democratic National Committee $1 million.         Joan Beverly Mansfield was born in St. Paul on Aug. 27, 1928. She and Mr. Kroc were married in 1969, a second marriage for both, and moved from Chicago to San Diego after he bought the Padres in 1974. After he died in 1984, she was active in managing the club until it was sold in 1990.         She is survived by a daughter, Linda Smith; a sister, Gloria Chadima of Minneapolis; four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Beatrice Blyth Whiting, an anthropologist at Harvard and an expert on the influence of culture on personality, died on Sept. 29 in Cambridge, Mass. She was 89.         Dr. Whiting and her husband, Dr. John W. M. Whiting, a fellow Harvard anthropologist, traveled extensively to study parental practices and child behavior, hoping to identify aspects of human development found in all cultures.         In 1954, she and her husband began the Six Cultures Study of Socialization, a project that involved field studies in Mexico, India, Kenya, Okinawa, the Philippines and the United States. Their work with the project resulted in many scholarly articles.         Twelve years later, they founded the Child Development Research Unit at the University of Nairobi to conduct more intensive studies in Kenya.         In the 1980's, after their retirement from Harvard, the Whitings turned their attention to older children, directing the Comparative Adolescence Project.         Dr. Whiting developed a particular interest in the development of gender roles, a subject she covered in her 1988 book, ''Children of Different Worlds: The Formation of Social Behavior,'' written with Dr. Carolyn P. Edwards. Her book on the lives of Kenyan women, ''Ngecha: A Kenyan Community in a Time of Rapid Social Change,'' also written with Dr. Edwards, is to be published later this year.         Dr. Whiting, who joined Harvard's faculty in 1952, became one of the first women at the university to receive tenure when she was named professor of education at the graduate school of education in 1974. She was a graduate of Bryn Mawr and received a doctorate in anthropology from Yale in 1943.         She lived in Cambridge and in Chilmark on Martha's Vineyard.         Beatrice Blyth Whiting was born on Staten Island on April 14, 1914. She is survived by her daughter, Susan Whiting of Chilmark and Stuart, Fla. Her husband died in 1999.
