Among her accomplishments, Mr. Claiborne said, she ''made the best pies in the world.''         Since Ms. Seranne admitted to having a sweet tooth, it is not surprising that many of her books concerned desserts. Among them were ''The Complete Book of Desserts'' (Doubleday, 1963) and ''Delectable Desserts'' (Little Brown, 1962). ''Those books got me started,'' said Maida Heatter, a nationally known expert on desserts. ''They're just as important today as then.''

Nancy Hale, a novelist and short-story writer, died Saturday at the Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Va., after suffering a stroke. She was 80 years old and lived in Charlottesville.         Flickers of prim Boston, social New York and proper Virginia danced through her works, the earlier ones focusing on the follies and foibles of well-bred women.         ''I specialize in women,'' Miss Hale said in an interview in 1942, ''because they are so mysterious to me. I feel that I know men quite thoroughly, that I know how, in a given situation, a man is apt to react. But women puzzle me.''         Nancy Hale was born in Boston on May 6, 1908, the daughter of Philip L. Hale and Lilian Westcott Hale, both painters.

Bored with Boston, she moved to New York in 1928. After working as an assistant editor at Vogue (''I pinch-hit as a model''), she joined The New York Times as a reporter. In 1929 she began to contribute ''casuals'' - humorous sketches - and stories to The New Yorker.         She became one of the New Yorker's best-known writers, and once boasted that she sold the magazine more stories in a single year than any other writer. First Novel About the Young         Miss Hale's first novel, ''The Young Die Good,'' was published in 1932. It was based on her idea that young New Yorkers wanted something more than they were getting in life but had neither ''the courage nor strength to go out and get it.'' Her second novel, ''Never Any More,'' appeared in 1934, followed in 1936 by a collection of short stories, ''The Earliest Dreams.''         Among her other works were ''New England Discovery'' (1963), ''Life in the Studio'' (1969), ''Secrets'' (1971), ''Mary Cassatt'' (1975) and ''The Night of the Hurricane'' (1978).         She is survived by her husband, Fredson T. Bowers, of Charlottesville, a former chairman of the English department of the University of Virginia; two sons by previous marriages, William Wertenbaker, of New Haven, Conn., and Mark Hardin; five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.

Hospital. She was 78 years old and lived in Bridgewater, Conn.         Miss Nordstrom is credited with helping to change children's books from moralistic works written for adult approval to works directed at the emotions, imaginations and problems of children. The New York Times called her books ''milestones along the path of children's literature.''         In 1945 Miss Nordstrom edited E. B. White's first children's book, ''Stuart Little.'' In 1952 the author unexpectedly presented her with his only copy of the manuscript of ''Charlotte's Web,'' and she described the moment with the relish and enthusiasm of someone who treasured writers.         ''I was overwhelmed,'' she wrote in an article in The New York Times Book Review in 1974. ''I didn't dare take a chance on losing the manuscript on the train home, or whatever. So I sat down and began to read.'' Respect for Children         Miss Nordstrom exhibited equal respect for her audience of children, appealing to their fantasies as well as their fears. She edited books about divorce, alcoholism and loneliness. One of her authors, Louise Fitzhugh, wrote in ''The Long Secret,'' about a girl's first menstruation. ''William's Doll,'' which told of a boy who wanted a doll, appalled many men in publishing and enthralled feminists, who felt it was appropriate training for fatherhood.         In 1963 Miss Nordstrom published Maurice Sendak's ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' filled with the aggressive and hairy monsters of a child's fantasy, after other publishing houses had rejected it, said Charlotte Zolotow, a former vice president of Harper & Row and Miss Nordstrom's colleague.         ''With her incomparable editorial genius, Ursula Nordstrom transformed the American children's book into a genuine art form,'' Mr. Sendak said yesterday. ''I was there, one of her eager apprentices, profiting immensely from her intuition and her generous heart. She was the best of mommas, the best of teachers, the best of friends.''         ''She was one of the great innovators,'' said Mrs. Zolotow, who worked with Miss Nordstrom for more than 40 years and who is the author of 60 children's books. ''She liked realistic books, where parents weren't always dear and good and children faced problems in their lives.''         Miss Nordstrom also risked writing her own book, ''The Secret Language,'' about life in a girl's boarding school that must have resembled those she attended. It became an American Library Association Notable Children's Book of 1960. Own Imprint in the 70's         Miss Nordstrom, who was born in Manhattan, began at Harper & Row in 1936. She became head of the children's book department in 1940 and in 1960 became the publishing company's first female vice president. In 1973, she stepped down as publisher and continued as senior editor with her own imprint until 1979. Among her other authors were Ruth Krauss, Shel Silverstein, Toni Ungerer, Laura Ingalls Wilder and Garth Williams.         Her books have won many awards, including three Newbury Medals for literature and two Caldecott Medals for illustration, the most important children's book awards.         With her at the time of death was her longtime companion, Mary Griffith. There are no survivors.

        When asked, after a trip to Egypt, how she liked the pyramids, the sculptor Louise Nevelson replied, ''Too small.'' The response, said the art dealer Arnold Glimcher, typified her sense of ''grandeur,'' her ''great expectations'' for herself and everyone around her.         When asked, after a trip to Egypt, how she liked the pyramids, the sculptor Louise Nevelson replied, ''Too small.'' The response, said the art dealer Arnold Glimcher, typified her sense of ''grandeur,'' her ''great expectations'' for herself and everyone around her.         Mr. Glimcher's anecdote was one of many wonderful stories told about the irreverent and irrepressible sculptor at a memorial service held yesterday in the Medieval Court of the Metropolitan Museum. Mrs. Nevelson died at her home in SoHo on April 17 at the age of 88.         Among the more than 250 people who attended were stellar figures from the worlds of art, fashion and the movies. They included the artists Jasper Johns, Marisol, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal and Saul Steinberg; the art dealer Leo Castelli; the actress Sigourney Weaver; the musician John Cage; the couturier Arnold Scaasi; the photographer Arnold Newman, and the museum directors Philippe de Montebello, Richard Oldenburg and Robert Buck, along with William Luers, the Metropolitan's president. Also in attendance were Mrs. Nevelson's son, Mike Nevelson; her sister-in-law, Lillian Berliawsky, and her longtime assistant, Diana McKown. Between tributes spoken by friends, a quintet played music by Beethoven, Mozart and Ludwig Thuille, a 19th-century German composer. Rearranging 'Mountain Woman'         At the gathering, William Lieberman, director of the department of 20th-century art at the Met, described Mrs. Nevelson as ''a great artist, a wonderful woman, an elegant lady and a good and generous friend.''         Mr. Glimcher, Mrs. Nevelson's dealer for many years, drew laughter from the guests by telling of her reluctance to exhibit ''Mountain Woman'' -an early work that she had always disliked - in her 1967 retrospective at the Whitney Museum. As the curator kept insisting on it, ''she was more and more unhappy,'' he said.         Shortly before the show opened, Mrs. Nevelson requested that Mr. Glimcher help her ''rearrange'' it. ''She asked us to carry 'Mountain Woman' across the room, and at midpoint she said, ''Drop it,'' Mr. Glimcher recalled. ''We did, and the work was 'rearranged' to her satisfaction, in a thousand pieces.'' A Telegram at Yaddo         Hilton Kramer, editor of The New Criterion, a magazine of the arts, told of writing one of the earliest reviews of Mrs. Nevelson's work in the mid-1950's. It was the first in her long series of sculptural environments known as ''walls.'' He said that later, at Yaddo, the writers' retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., he was summoned to the telephone by Western Union with a telegram from Mrs. Nevelson. ''The telegram read, 'I love you,' '' Mr. Kramer recalled.         Despite her later success, he went on to say, Mrs. Nevelson ''remained extraordinarily independent of her reputation and other people's reputations.'' And he cited her belief that ''you can be anything you want to be'' as ''the key to her artistic ambitions, her esthetic audacity and the personal freedom she achieved as woman as well as artist.''         Barbaralee Diamonstein, a member of the New York City Landmarks Commission, a writer on art and architecture and a longtime friend of Mrs. Nevelson, described the sculptor -known for her theatrical garb and personality almost as much as for her art - as ''all collage:her work, her conversation, her ensembles.''         ''A complex cross between a princess and a peasant, an egalitarian with some surprisingly elitist concerns,'' she said, ''Louise was a living assemblage who accurately mirrored her startling and stunning constructions.'' 'I Always Knew I Was Great'         Speaking also of Mrs. Nevelson's belief in herself as a vital factor in her work, Miss Diamonstein recalled once asking her how she had survived during her many years of obscurity before success. ''I always knew I was great,'' Mrs. Nevelson replied. The short program was ended by the playwright Edward Albee, who said Mrs. Nevelson had understood ''perhaps better than any artist I've known, that she was her art.'' And he told of interviewing the sculptor with a tape recorder for an article he was writing. ''She said she didn't mind,'' he said. ''I tested it out and it worked well. Then, when I actually put it on the table, she said 'What's that?' She passed her hand over it a few times. I asked the important questions. When I got home, my tape recorder was blank. It was simply that Louise was a wizard and those of us who knew her, knew her work, we knew she was a wizard, did we not?''       
        Marian P. Welch, the editor of two publications for the John Birch Society, which was founded by her late husband, died Tuesday at Glover Memorial Hospital. She was 88 years old.         Marian P. Welch, the editor of two publications for the John Birch Society, which was founded by her late husband, died Tuesday at Glover Memorial Hospital. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Welch, who graduated from Wellesley College in 1922, was editor of the society's weekly newspapers, The New American and Review of the News.         The society was founded in 1958 by 12 men, including her husband, Robert, and named after a young American missionary who was killed in China in 1954. The group has its headquarters in Belmont, a Boston suburb, where the Welches lived for 40 years. Robert Welch died in 1985.         The John Birch Society first gained national attention in the 1950's when it accused former President Eisenhower and Secretary of State John Foster Dulles of being implicated in a Communist plot to take over the United States Government.         Correction:  December 4, 1988, Sunday, Late City Final Edition         An obituary by The Associated Press in some copies last Sunday about Marian P. Welch, editor of two John Birch Society publications, described the namesake of the society incorrectly. Capt. John Birch, a missionary in China before World War II, served in the war as an intelligence officer. He was killed by Chinese Communists on Aug. 25, 1945, 10 days after V-J Day.
