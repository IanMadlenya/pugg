         Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in Congress and the first woman to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, died on Saturday night at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 80. She had suffered several strokes recently, according to a former staff member, William Howard.         Mrs. Chisholm was an outspoken, steely educator-turned-politician who shattered racial and gender barriers as she became a national symbol of liberal politics in the 1960's and 1970's. Over the years, she also had a way of making statements that angered the establishment, as in 1974, when she asserted that ''there is an undercurrent of resistance'' to integration ''among many blacks in areas of concentrated poverty and discrimination'' -- including in her own district in Brooklyn.         ''Just wait, there may be some fireworks,'' she declared after winning her seat in Congress in 1968 with an upset victory in Brooklyn's 12th Congressional District, which had been created by court-ordered reapportionment.         Her slogan was ''unbought and unbossed'' -- in the primary, she had defeated two other candidates, William C. Thompson, whom she maintained was the candidate of the Brooklyn Democratic organization, and Dolly Robinson. ''The party leaders do not like me,'' Mrs. Chisholm said at the time.         But about 80 percent of the registered voters in the district -- which included her own neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant -- were Democrats. That edge helped her in her race against James Farmer, a leader of the Freedom Rides in the south in the early 1960's, who ran as an independent on the Republican and Liberal lines, and Ralph Carrano, who ran as the Conservative candidate.         ''I am an historical person at this point, and I'm very much aware of it,'' she told The Washington Post a few months after she was sworn in.         Soon she was challenging the seniority system in the House, which had relegated her to its Agriculture Committee, an assignment she criticized as irrelevant to an urban district like hers.         ''Apparently all they know here in Washington about Brooklyn is that a tree grew there,'' she said in a statement at the time. ''Only nine black people have been elected to Congress, and those nine should be used as effectively as possible.''         She said that the House speaker, John W. McCormack, had told her to ''be a good soldier'' and accept the agriculture assignment. Instead, she fired a parliamentary salvo at the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur D. Mills, who handed out the committee assignments. Before long, she was reassigned, first to the Veterans Affairs Committee, and eventually to the Education and Labor Committees.         Winning a better committee assignment did not make her any less acerbic on the workings of Washington. ''Our representative democracy is not working,'' she wrote in a 1970 book that borrowed her campaign slogan as its title, ''because the Congress that is supposed to represent the voters does not respond to their needs. I believe the chief reason for this is that it is ruled by a small group of old men.''         In 1972, when she entered the presidential primaries, she did not expect to capture the Democratic nomination, which ultimately went to George S. McGovern. ''Some see my candidacy as an alternate and others as symbolic or a move to make other candidates start addressing themselves to real issues,'' she said at the time. She did not win a single primary, but in 2002, she said her campaign had been a necessary ''catalyst for change.''         She was also aware of her status as a woman in politics. ''I've always met more discrimination being a woman than being black,'' she told The Associated Press in December 1982, shortly before she left Washington to teach at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. ''When I ran for the Congress, when I ran for president, I met more discrimination as a woman than for being black. Men are men.''         Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Nov. 30, 1924. Her father worked in a factory that made burlap bags, and her mother was a seamstress and domestic worker. They sent their daughter and her three sisters to Barbados, where the children lived with a grandmother until 1934. Mrs. Chisholm later described the relatives she encountered there as ''a strongly disciplined family unit.''         But she had her own strength, too: ''Mother always said that even when I was 3, I used to get the 6- and 7-year-old kids on the block and punch them and say, 'Listen to me.'''         Her professors listened to her at Brooklyn College, where she won prizes in debating. Some of them told her she should think about politics as a career.         First, though, she taught in a nursery school and earned a master's degree in elementary education at Columbia University. Working as the director of the Friends Day Nursery in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and the Hamilton-Madison Child Care Center in Lower Manhattan, she became widely known as an authority on early education and child welfare. She argued that early schooling was essential, saying she knew there were experts who maintained that children's eyes were not developed enough for reading. ''I say baloney, because I learned to read when I was 3 1/2,'' she countered, ''and I learned to write when I was 4.''         From 1959 to 1964, she was an educational consultant in the day care division of the city's bureau of child welfare. But she laid a foundation for her eventual political career, working as a clubhouse volunteer and with organizations like the Bedford-Stuyvesant Political League and the League of Women Voters.         So, when she decided to run for the New York State Assembly in 1964, she said the decision was straightforward: ''The people wanted me.''         She moved on to the House four years later, in the year when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run for re-election. A year later, she confirmed her reputation for independence when she endorsed John V. Lindsay, who was running for re-election as mayor of New York         as the Liberal Party candidate.By 1982, the political climate had changed, and Mrs. Chisholm left Washington after seven terms in the House, saying that ''moderate and liberal'' lawmakers were ''running for cover from the new right.'' But she also had personal reasons for deciding not to seek re-election that year: Her second husband, Arthur Hardwick, a Buffalo liquor store owner who had been in the New York State Assembly when Mrs. Chisholm was, had been injured in a car accident. (Her first marriage, to Conrad O. Chisholm, ended in divorce in 1977. Mr. Hardwick died in 1986.)         ''I had been so consumed by my life in politics,'' she said in 1982. ''I had no time for privacy, no time for my husband, no time to play my beautiful grand piano. After he recovered, I decided to make some changes in my life. I truly believe God had a message for me.''         She also sounded frustrated, saying she had been misunderstood for much of her career. She mentioned her hospital visit to George C. Wallace, the Alabama governor who built his political career on segregation, after he had been wounded in an assassination attempt in 1972.         ''Black people in my community crucified me,'' she recalled. ''But why shouldn't I go to visit him? Every other presidential candidate was going to see him. He said to me, 'What are your people going to say?' I said: 'I know what they're going to say. But I wouldn't want what happened to you to happen to anyone.' He cried and cried and cried.''         She maintained that her visit had paid off. ''He always spoke well of Shirley Chisholm in the South,'' she said, adding that she had contacted him in 1974, when she was looking for votes for a bill to extend federal minimum-wage provisions to domestic workers. ''Many of the Southerners did not want to make the vote. They came around.''         Mrs. Chisholm moved to Florida in 1991 and said in 2002, ''I live a very quiet life.'' She said she spent her time reading biographies -- political biographies.         ''I have faded out of the scene,'' she said.         When she left Washington, she said she did not want to go down in history as ''the nation's first black congresswoman'' or, as she put it, ''the first black woman congressman.''         ''I'd like them to say that Shirley Chisholm had guts,'' she said. ''That's how I'd like to be remembered.''

         Myriam J. Altman, an appeals judge of the New York State Supreme Court since 1994, died on Jan. 29 at New York University Hospital. She was 65 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was complications of myelofibrosis, a bone marrow disorder, her family said.         Justice Altman resigned from the bench just days before her death. She was an associate justice of the Appellate Division's far-flung Second Department, based in Brooklyn, but had her chambers in Manhattan.         A New York judge since 1978, she was appointed to the Appellate Division by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. She was recommended several times by the Commission on Judicial Nominations for an appointment to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court and a rung above the Appellate Division.         Myriam Jarblum was born in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1939. Her family fled Belgium and the Nazi occupation in 1941, escaping via Vichy France, Spain and Portugal and managing to reach Cuba on one of the last refugee ships.         She was 7 when the family came to the United States. She graduated from Barnard College in 1959 and received her law degree from New York University Law School in 1963. Before she joined the bench, she was in private practice and served as a law secretary in court.         She was a judge on the New York City Civil Court from 1978 to 1987, sitting as an acting justice of State Supreme Court for most of those years, presiding over civil and, later, criminal cases. She was elected a Supreme Court justice in 1987 and served in its Civil Term until her promotion to the Appellate Division in January 1994.         She was a past member of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct and the Ethics Commission of the Unified Court System.         Justice Altman is survived by her husband, Herbert I. Altman, a former justice of State Supreme Court; two sons,, Michael T., of Woodmere, N.Y., and Daniel, of Teaneck, N.J.; a daughter, Sarah R. Stark of Raanana, Israel; a brother, William Jarblum of Los Angeles; and nine grandchildren.       
         Former Representative Tillie Fowler, who despite being the most powerful woman in Congress did not run for re-election in 2000 to keep a promise to serve only four terms, died yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 62.         She had suffered a brain hemorrhage two days earlier, a family spokesman, Tom Alexander, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Fowler was vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and No.5 in the House leadership when she left Congress. Her steely intelligence earned her the nickname Steel Magnolia. A member of the House Armed Services Committee, she was known for her expertise on military matters, including vigorous efforts to retain armed services bases in her Florida district.         After leaving Congress in 2001 and joining a law firm, she continued her leadership role in military matters as chairwoman of both the commission that investigated sexual abuse accusations at the United States Air Force Academy and the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, which advises the secretary of defense.         Ms. Fowler was also on an independent panel that last year investigated the abuse of prisoners in Iraq, attributing the problem to a string of failures that led all the way up the chain of command to the Pentagon.         She was born on Dec. 23, 1942, in Milledgeville, Ga., where her father, Culver Kidd, owned a drug store. Mr. Kidd served for 44 years in the Georgia Legislature.         A photograph in Ms. Fowler's Congressional office showed her at age 7 playing on the desk of Gov. Herman Talmadge of Georgia. She recalled that she was arguing with him.         She earned a law degree from Emory University, where she also did her undergraduate work. She later worked as a Congressional aide and in the Nixon White House, in consumer affairs. In 1971, she moved to Jacksonville with her husband, Buck Fowler.         She threw herself into volunteer work, then used those contacts to run successfully for the Jacksonville City Council. Elected president of the Council, she had three members arrested in 1989, when they tried to walk out of a meeting, which would have prevented a quorum needed to pass the city budget.         In 1992, she ran for Congress, promising to serve no more than four terms. She received 57 percent of the vote and was unopposed in her next three races.         She got a seat on the Armed Services Committee and was elected co-chairwoman of the Freshman Republican Task Force on Reform. In her second term, she became a deputy whip for the Republicans. In late 1996, Speaker Newt Gingrich gave her and Representative Jane Harman, Democrat of California, the tough assignment of investigating sexual harassment in the Army.         In 1998, Ms. Fowler was elected vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference on the vow that she would serve no longer than two years in the Republican leadership. She filed papers in 1999 to seek re-election, but later decided to keep her initial promise.         She is survived by her husband and her daughters, Tillie Anne, of Washington, and Elizabeth, of California.       
         Audrey G. Hochberg, a former New York State assemblywoman, died yesterday morning at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Scarsdale.         The cause was uterine cancer, her daughter Judith Hochberg said.         A Democrat, Ms. Hochberg represented the 88th Assembly District, which includes Scarsdale, Eastchester, Pelham and parts of New Rochelle and White Plains. First elected in 1992, she retired in 2000 after four terms.         Ms. Hochberg, who held public office for nearly three decades, was noted for her work on environmental, civil-rights and gun-control issues. She began her political career as a member of the Westchester County Board of Legislators, only the second woman, and at the time one of the few Democrats, to win a seat there.         Audrey Elaine Golden was born in Stamford, Conn., on June 26, 1933, the daughter of Abraham H. Golden and the former Fannie Dodek. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Radcliffe in 1955 and married Herbert L. Hochberg the same year.         Ms. Hochberg first worked as a security analyst with Shields & Company, a brokerage house, but later set her career aside to raise three children. She became politically active during the Vietnam era, working in the antiwar movement and in Democratic Party politics. In 1971 she was elected to the Westchester County legislature, where she served for 21 years.         In the State Assembly, Ms. Hochberg, the chairwoman of the Legislative Commission on Solid Waste Management, sponsored bills aimed at improving the state's recycling programs.         Besides her husband and daughter, both of Scarsdale, Ms. Hochberg is survived by a sister, Merle Bogin, of Manhattan; another daughter, Brenda Hochberg, of Brookline, Mass.; and seven grandchildren. A third daughter, Carol, died in 1998.       
         Sue Gunter, a pioneering women's college basketball coach who turned Louisiana State University into a national power in a career spanning four decades, died yesterday at her home in Baton Rouge, La.         Gunter, a member of two basketball halls of fame, was 66.         The cause was respiratory failure, the university announced.         Gunter stopped coaching during the 2003-4 season because of severe emphysema and acute chronic bronchitis. Until then, she had missed only one game as a college coach, for her mother's funeral.         Gunter was a head coach at Middle Tennessee (1962-64), Stephen F. Austin (1964-80) and L.S.U. (1982-2004), reaching the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament 14 times with L.S.U. From 1980 to 1982, she was the women's athletic director at Stephen F. Austin.         Her career coaching record was 708-308. Only Pat Summitt of Tennessee (852-167) and Judy Conradt of Texas (869-278) have won more games in women's basketball.         Gunter was elected to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000, and to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in March.         She turned over the L.S.U. team to Pokey Chatman, who had spent the last 17 seasons with her as a player or as an assistant coach. Gunter, an oxygen tank at her side, watched practice and films.         L.S.U., under Chatman, reached the N.C.A.A. tournament's Final Four the last two seasons.         Sue Gunter was born May 22, 1939, in Walnut Grove, Miss.         She received bachelor's and master's degrees from Peabody College of Nashville in the early 1960's while playing Amateur Athletic Union basketball for Nashville Business College. From 1960 to 1962, she played for United States national teams against those from the Soviet Union.         Her early coaching career offered few luxuries. At Stephen F. Austin, she also coached softball, tennis and track.         ''She was an administrator,'' Chatman told LSUsports.net last year. ''She probably taught a class. She drove the bus. She coached the team. I remember she told me when she became head coach at Stephen F. Austin she was making $6,500 a year and she thought she'd hit the lottery.''         Conradt told The New York Times last year: ''Sue is one of a group of coaches who, early on, made a commitment to the sport when there was no tangible reason to do it. We weren't paid very well. We toiled in obscurity. The joy of being able to coach young women was reward enough.''         In 1980, Gunter was the head coach of the United States Olympic women's basketball team, which never made it to the Moscow Games because of a United States boycott to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. Gunter, who never married, left no immediate survivors.         ''I've been very fortunate,'' she told the LSU Campus publication last year. ''People will call me on the history of women's college basketball, and I say sometimes that I feel like I am the archives.''         Correction:  August 13, 2005, Saturday  An obituary on Aug. 5 about Sue Gunter, a pioneering women's college basketball coach, misstated her standing on the lifetime victory list. It also misstated another coach's record and the given name of a third coach. Three coaches (not two) surpassed her 708 victories: Pat Summitt, whose record is 882-172 (not 852-167); Jody Conradt (not Judy), 869; and C. Vivian Stringer, 723.       
         Constance Baker Motley, a civil rights lawyer who fought nearly every important civil rights case for two decades and then became the first black woman to serve as a federal judge, died yesterday at NYU Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Isolde Motley, her daughter-in-law.         Judge Motley was the first black woman to serve in the New York State Senate, as well as the first woman to be Manhattan borough president, a position that guaranteed her a voice in running the entire city under an earlier system of local government called the Board of Estimate.         Judge Motley was at the center of the firestorm that raged through the South in the two decades after World War II, as blacks and their white allies pressed to end the segregation that had gripped the region since Reconstruction. She visited the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in jail, sang freedom songs in churches that had been bombed, and spent a night under armed guard with Medgar Evers, the civil rights leader who was later murdered.         But her métier was in the quieter, painstaking preparation and presentation of lawsuits that paved the way to fuller societal participation by blacks. She dressed elegantly, spoke in a low, lilting voice and, in case after case, earned a reputation as the chief courtroom tactician of the civil rights movement.         Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama and other staunch segregationists yielded, kicking and screaming, to the verdicts of courts ruling against racial segregation. These huge victories were led by the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, led by Thurgood Marshall, for which Judge Motley, Jack Greenberg, Robert Carter and a handful of other underpaid, overworked lawyers labored.         In particular, she directed the legal campaign that resulted in the admission of James H. Meredith to the University of Mississippi in 1962. She argued 10 cases before the United States Supreme Court and won nine of them.         Judge Motley won cases that ended segregation in Memphis restaurants and at whites-only lunch counters in Birmingham, Ala. She fought for King's right to march in Albany, Ga. She played an important role in representing blacks seeking admission to the Universities of Florida, Georgia Alabama and Mississippi and Clemson College in South Carolina.         She helped write briefs in the landmark school desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and in later elementary-school integration cases.         Judge Motley was a tall, gracious and stately woman whose oft-stated goal was as simple as it was sometimes elusive: dignity for all people. Her personal approach was also dignified. When a reporter wrote that she had demanded some action by the court, she soon corrected him:         ''What do you mean 'I demanded the court'? You don't demand, you pray for relief or move for some action.''         Charlayne Hunter-Gault, whose admission to the University of Georgia was engineered by Mrs. Motley's legal finesse, described her courtroom cunning.         ''Mrs. Motley's style could be deceptive, often challenging a witness to get away with one lie after another without challenging them,'' she wrote in her book ''In My Place,'' published in 1992. ''It was as if she would lull them into an affirmation of their own arrogance, causing them to relax as she appeared to wander aimlessly off into and around left field, until she suddenly threw a curveball with so much skill and power it would knock them off their chair.''         As a black woman practicing law in the South, she endured gawking and more than a few physical threats. A local paper in Jackson, Miss., derided her as ''the Motley woman.''         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her as a judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York at the urging of Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, a Democrat, and with the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits, a Republican. The opposition of Southern senators like James O. Eastland, a Mississippi Democrat, was beaten back, and her appointment was confirmed. She became chief judge of the district in 1982 and senior judge in 1986.         Constance Baker was born on Sept. 14, 1921, in New Haven, the ninth of 12 children. Her parents came from the tiny Caribbean island Nevis at the beginning of the 20th century.         Her father worked as a chef for various Yale University student organizations, including Skull and Bones. She attended local schools in what was then an overwhelmingly white community.         One of her first experiences with discrimination came at 15, when she was turned away from a public beach because she was black.         She read books dealing with black history and became president of the local N.A.A.C.P. youth council. She decided that she wanted to be a lawyer, but her family lacked money to send their many children to college. After high school, she struggled to earn a living as a domestic worker.         When she was 18, she made a speech at local African-American social center that was heard by Clarence W. Blakeslee, a white businessman and philanthropist who sponsored the center. He was impressed and offered to finance her education.         She decided to attend Fisk University, a black college in Nashville, partly because she had never been to the South. In Nashville, she encountered a rigidly segregated society, and brought her parents a poignant souvenir: a sign that read ''Colored Only.''         After a year and a half at Fisk, she transferred to New York University. After graduation in 1943, she entered Columbia Law School, where she began to work as a volunteer at the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, an affiliate of the National Organization for the Advancement of Colored People that Mr. Marshall and his mentor, Charles Houston, had created in 1939.         After she graduated in 1946, she began to work full time for the civil rights group at a salary of $50 a week. She worked first on housing cases, fighting to break the restrictive covenants that barred blacks from white neighborhoods.         Also in 1946, she married Joel Wilson Motley Jr., a New York real estate broker. He survives her, as does their son, Joel III, who lives in Scarborough, N.Y.; three grandchildren; her brother Edmund Baker of Florida; and her sisters Edna Carnegie, Eunice Royster and Marian Green, all of New Haven.         Mr. Marshall had no qualms about sending her into the tensest racial terrain, precisely because she was a woman. She said she believed that was why she was assigned to the Meredith case in 1961.         ''Thurgood says that the only people who are safe in the South are the women -- white and Negro,'' she said in an interview with Pictorial Living, the magazine of The New York Journal-American, in 1965. ''I don't know how he's got that figured. But, so far, I've never been subjected to any violence.''         Mr. Meredith's admission to the University of Mississippi in September 1962 was a major victory for the civil rights movement. Mrs. Motley worked on the case for 18 months before Mr. Meredith's name was even seen in the papers.         She made 22 trips to Mississippi as the case dragged on. Judge Motley once called the day Mr. Meredith accepted his diploma in 1963 the most thrilling in her life.         She said her greatest professional satisfaction came with the reinstatement of 1,100 black children in Birmingham who had been expelled for taking part in street demonstrations in the spring of 1963.         In February 1964, Mrs. Motley's high-level civil rights profile drew her into politics. A Democratic State Senate candidate from the Upper West Side was ruled off the ballot because of an election-law technicality. She accepted the nomination on the condition that it would not interfere with her N.A.A.C.P. work and handily defeated a Republican to become the first black woman elected to the State Senate. She was re-elected that November.         She remained in the job until February 1965, when she was chosen by unanimous vote of the City Council to fill a one-year vacancy as Manhattan borough president. In citywide elections nine months later, she was re-elected to a full four-year term with the endorsement of the Democratic, Republican and Liberal Parties.         As borough president, she drew up a seven-point program for the revitalization of Harlem and East Harlem, securing $700,000 to plan for those and other underprivileged areas of the city.         After becoming a federal judge in 1966, Judge Motley ruled in many cases, but her decisions often reflected her past. She decided on behalf of welfare recipients, low-income Medicaid patients and a prisoner who claimed to have been unconstitutionally punished by 372 days of solitary confinement, whom she awarded damages.         She continued to try cases after she took senior status. Her hope as a judge was that she would change the world for the better, she said.         ''The work I'm doing now will affect people's lives intimately,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1977, ''it may even change them.''         Correction:  October 5, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary on Thursday about Constance Baker Motley, the first black woman to serve as a federal judge, misstated the given name of her surviving brother and the means by which she was named to fill a vacancy as Manhattan borough president. Her brother is Edward Baker, not Edmund; she took office by a unanimous vote of the City Council members from Manhattan, not of the Council as a whole. The article also misstated part of the name of the civil rights organization that was then the parent of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund, for which Judge Motley began volunteer work in 1943. It is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People -- not National Organization.       
         Mary Lee Settle, a master of historical fiction who recreated time and place with visceral, almost fanatical accuracy, died Tuesday at a hospice in Charlottesville, Va. She was 87 and made her home in Charlottesville.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Christopher Weathersbee.         Ms. Settle, who was a National Book Award winner and the author of the novels known as ''The Beulah Quintet,'' explained her research process in an introduction to ''O Beulah Land,'' the first in an interconnected five-book saga that spanned three centuries, from Cromwell's England to what Ms. Settle called ''the feudal coal culture'' of West Virginia, her native state.         To inform her book, she wrote, it was necessary to ''let the past become a present, let it fall beyond intelligence into reliving, which is true sensuous recall, where dreams come from with all their fears and future hopes of things long past.''         ''The Beulah Quintet'' novels, written between 1956 and 1982, were linked by an exploration of the ways American concepts of personal freedom evolved, and began with the journey of former English prisoners to West Virginia's Kanawha Valley (called Beulah in the novels). For instance, the plot of ''The Scapegoat'' (1980), the fourth volume, unfolds during a violent 1912 confrontation between miners and owners. The other books are ''Know Nothing'' (1960), ''Prisons'' (written in 1973, years after ''O Beulah Land,'' but labeled Book I because the action takes place earlier in history) and ''The Killing Ground'' (1982).         But Ms. Settle's work ranged far beyond her birthplace, geographically and otherwise. In 1978, she received the National Book Award for ''Blood Tie,'' the story of American and British expatriates in Turkey. She had been living there, well aware of the sociocultural influences that traveled both ways between natives and outsiders. Reviewing the novel in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard wrote that the American and British characters were ''like so many Typhoid Marys, carrying the disease of change, change as a fever, wherever they go.''         If Ms. Settle's work was never wildly fashionable -- possibly because ''I don't write about being vaguely unhappy in Connecticut,'' she once said -- that allowed it to age well.         In her historical novels, readers could be assured that the characters spoke pretty much the way people in their time and place spoke, or as close to it as was humanly possible to determine. Ms. Settle had been known to spend months on end reading letters and other accounts from the period she was researching without taking a single note. ''She believed that the key to understanding these people was in their words,'' said Starling Lawrence, her editor at W.W. Norton. So she simply immersed herself in them.         ''Ye're no more nor 19, if that,'' a character in ''O Beulah Land'' tells a new acquaintance. In ''I, Roger Williams: Fragment of an Autobiography'' (2001), Williams has low opinions of ''brabble'' and ''fribbling matters.''         Ms. Settle, always sympathetic to other writers and an advocate of their causes, decided that authors should have their own awards program, with the winners chosen by fellow authors. That way the selections would be independent of publishing industry influences. The idea turned into the PEN/Faulkner award, which began in 1980 and which, with a $15,000 grand prize, has become the largest of the country's major fiction awards.         Mary Lee Settle was born on July 29, 1918, in Charleston, W.Va., the daughter of Joseph Edward and Rachel Tompkins Settle. Her father was a civil engineer in charge of worker safety at coal mines. That industry ran into financial difficulties even before the Depression. More than a half century later, Ms. Settle recalled ''the brave Christmas dinner of 1930'' when she and her parents were living with her grandmother ''because the bottom had dropped out of the coal business.'' Ms. Settle attended Sweet Briar College in Virginia for two years, then began a career as a fashion model. ''I took for granted the kind of looks that other women envied and that I treated with a slight contempt,'' she wrote at the age of 69, contemplating the advisability of face-lifts. She is also said to have been given a screen test, along with half of Hollywood, for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.''         During World War II she went to England and served in the women's branch of the Royal Air Force, an experience she recounted later in ''All the Brave Promises: Memories of Aircraft Woman Second Class 2146391.''         In New York after the war, she worked as a magazine editor, but briefly. She often told the story of how, while going over a Harper's Bazaar fashion layout that had been inspired by ''Wuthering Heights,'' she noticed in some notes that Emily Brontë had died at 30. It was then, she said, that she decided she had better start on the books she was planning to write, walked into the boss's office and resigned.         Nine years later her first book was published. ''The Love Eaters'' (1954) was about a small-town theater company. She went on to write 22 books, the most recent being ''Spanish Recognitions'' (2004), a travel memoir.         Ms. Settle traveled extensively and lived abroad at various periods in her life for various reasons. In the late 1960's she fulfilled a promise that many of her fellow Democrats had made to themselves. In 1987, she explained it to Nancy Carol Joyner of Western Carolina University: ''I said if Nixon was elected president I was going back to Europe. He was, and I did.''         Ms. Settle married three times and divorced twice. Her first two husbands, Rodney Weathersbee (1939-46) and Douglas Newton (1946-56), were British. In 1978, when she was 60, she married William L. Tazewell, an American writer and historian. He died in 1998.         Like many authors, she had an academic career as well. Her longest association was with Bard College, where she was an associate professor from 1965 to 1976. She also taught at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where she lived on and off throughout her life.         Ms. Settle never let age slow her writing career. ''Spanish Reflections'' was based on a trip that she took in her early 80's, after finishing ''I, Roger Williams.''         At the time of her death she was working on ''Tom: An Appreciation of Thomas Jefferson,'' an ''imagined biography'' focusing on Jefferson's youth. Her son said it was not yet clear whether the book was in shape for publication.         In addition to her son, now living in Charlottesville, she is survived by a granddaughter, Beatrice Weathersbee, of Portsmouth, N.H.; a grandson, Nicolas Weathersbee, of St. Petersburg, Fla.; and four great-grandchildren.         Just days before her death, Ms. Settle discussed her memorial service with Mr. Lawrence, her editor. In a conversation that inspired her to give an impromptu recitation of a Keats sonnet (''When I have fears that I may cease to be''), she told him that she would like to have the beginning of the Gospel of St. John read. ''If you're a writer, you can see the appeal of that text,'' Mr. Lawrence said.         The first words of the first verse of the Book of John are ''In the beginning was the word.''       
         C. DeLores Tucker, an outspoken advocate for minority and women's rights who marched arm in arm with Martin Luther King Jr. at Selma, Ala., and campaigned against profanity-ridden rap music lyrics, died on Oct. 12 at a rehabilitation center in Philadelphia. She was 78.         Peter Bailey, editor of ''Vital Issues: The Journal of African-American Speeches,'' which Mrs. Tucker founded, confirmed her death.         When she was 16, Mrs. Tucker raised her voice from the back of a flatbed truck to protest a Philadelphia hotel's refusal to admit black athletes. She went on to become the highest-ranking black woman in any state government when she served as secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the 1970's.         She started the first Commission on the Status of Women in Pennsylvania and helped found and led the National Political Congress of Black Women. She held leadership positions in the Democratic Party, the National Women's Caucus and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, among many other organizations.         Mrs. Tucker achieved perhaps her greatest fame in the 1990's when she campaigned against gangsta rap lyrics, calling them ''sleazy, pornographic smut.'' At one point, she bought 20 shares of Time-Warner stock and rose at an annual meeting to demand the company's leaders read aloud the lyrics on records one of their subsidiaries was selling. They declined.         In her zeal to fight gangsta rap, the fiercely partisan Democrat found herself allied with William J. Bennett, the conservative Republican who held top posts in the presidential administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.         Despite having raised more than $1 million for the N.A.A.C.P. as a public speaker, she picketed the organization's Image Awards because the rapper Tupac Shakur had been nominated for one. At the time, he was accused of sexually assaulting a 20-year-old female fan in New York and with shooting two Atlanta police officers in a traffic dispute.         At her funeral on Oct. 21, former Vice President Al Gore, one of many political leaders in attendance, called Mrs. Tucker ''a four-star general in the battle for righteousness.''         Cynthia DeLores Nottage was born in Philadelphia on Oct. 4, 1927, as the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. Whitfield Nottage and the former Captilda Gardiner. The children were raised in a strict religious atmosphere, not allowed to dance, listen to music or date until they were 21.         Because her father refused to accept pay for his pastor posts, Mrs. Tucker's mother became an entrepreneur to feed the family. She founded an employment agency for Southern blacks who migrated northward for jobs, ran a grocery store and became a landlord. When Mrs. Tucker later inherited some of those properties, political opponents accused her of being a slumlord.         She attended Temple University but did not earn a degree. Her first involvement in civil rights came when she registered black voters for a Philadelphia mayoral campaign in 1950.         The next year, she married William Tucker, a real estate executive, who is her only immediate survivor. They had no children but helped raise a number of relatives in their extended families.         In the 1960's, she campaigned for black candidates, served on the Pennsylvania Democratic Committee and earned a reputation as an excellent fund-raiser. She was the first black and the first woman elected to the Philadelphia Zoning Board. In 1971, Gov. Milton J. Shapp appointed her secretary of the commonwealth, equivalent to secretary of state in other states.         As secretary, she was a leader in instituting voter registration by mail and lowering the voting age to 18. Governor Shapp fired her in 1977 because of accusations that she used state employees to write speeches for which she was paid $66,931.         She ran unsuccessfully for Congress, lieutenant governor and the United States Senate.         Her involvement with gangsta rap began when a niece she was raising was ostracized for using foul language she had picked up from listening to the music. Music industry executives responded by suing her, and much of her later life was tangled in complicated suits and countersuits.         In 1997, she sued the estate of Mr. Shakur, who was shot to death the year before, for $10 million, alleging defamation for mentioning her in an obscene lyric. The suit was dismissed.       
         Margretta Madden Styles, a nursing educator who conceived and helped establish precise national standards for certifying nurses in pediatrics, cardiology and other medical specialties, died on Nov. 20 at her home in Clearwater, Fla. She was 75.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         It was in the 1970's that Dr. Styles and others began to press for stricter certification of nurses and a rational system to regulate them. She lectured and wrote on the subject in nursing journals, contributing articles on advanced nursing practices and ways to determine criteria for issuing sound credentials.         In the 1980's she helped found the American Nurses Credentialing Center, which now administers testing for more than 20 medical specialties and, said Catherine L. Gilliss, dean of the Duke University School of Nursing, ''helped to standardize across the nation just what to expect from your nurse.''         The center is the credentialing arm of the American Nurses Association, which represents 150,000 nurses and nurse specialists. Dr. Styles served as the association's president from 1986 to 1988.         Later in her career she studied the emerging importance of trained nurses in developing countries and, in 1993, was elected president of the International Council of Nurses.         She continued to write on certification and helped edit a popular anthology, ''On Nursing: A Literary Celebration'' (1993), which ''framed the art of healing, the pain of suffering, and was received as a gift to the profession,'' said Barbara A. Blakeney, the current president of the American Nurses Association.         Margretta Madden was born in Mount Union, Pa., and earned an undergraduate degree from Juniata College, a master's from Yale and a doctorate in education from the University of Florida.         She worked as a staff nurse in hospitals before becoming an associate professor of nursing at Duke in 1967. She was dean of nursing at the University of Texas at San Antonio; then at Wayne State University, in Detroit; and finally at the University of California, San Francisco.         Dr. Styles's husband of 47 years, the Rev. Douglas Styles, an Episcopal priest, died in 2002.         She is survived by two sons, Michael, of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Patrick, of Redmond, Wash.; a daughter, Megan Styles of Danville, Calif.; a brother, Joseph Madden of Indian Rocks, Fla.; a sister, Jane Rupp of St. Petersburg; and two grandchildren.
