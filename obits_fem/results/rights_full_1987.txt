        Septima Poinsette Clark, a teacher who had been active in civil rights activities since World War I, died Tuesday at a nursing home on John's Island. She was 89 years old.  Born in Charleston, the daughter of a former slave, Mrs. Clark was widely recognized for her work in civil rights. In 1964 she accompanied the Rev.         Septima Poinsette Clark, a teacher who had been active in civil rights activities since World War I, died Tuesday at a nursing home on John's Island. She was 89 years old.  Born in Charleston, the daughter of a former slave, Mrs. Clark was widely recognized for her work in civil rights. In 1964 she accompanied the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Norway when he was presented the Nobel Peace Prize.         ''The state has lost not only a leading civil rights activist but a legendary educator and humanitarian,'' Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. said today.         Mrs. Clark attended Avery Institute in Charleston, and received a bachelor's degree from Benedict College in Columbia and a master's degree from Hampton Institute in Virginia. Worked in Teacher Campaign         She began her teaching career at a black public school on John's Island and, in 1918, accepted a teaching post at Avery. That year, she was instrumental in getting about 20,000 signatures on a petition to have black teachers hired by the Charleston County School District.         Mrs. Clark moved to Columbia in 1927 to teach and helped in a campaign to equalize teacher salaries.         She later was dismissed from a teaching job in Charleston for being a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         In the late 1950's she worked at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, where she developed a program to teach blacks to read and write well enough to pass voter literacy tests. She lectured around the country and later became a director of the school and a supervisor of teacher training for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.         Her autobiography, ''Echo In My Soul,'' was published in 1962.         In 1974, Mrs. Clark was elected to the Charleston County School Board.         Mrs. Clark received a Living Legacy Award from President Carter in 1979 and the Order of the Palmetto, South Carolina's highest civilian award, in 1982.         She is survived by a son, Nerie D. Clark Jr., of Hickory, N.C., a sister and two brothers.       
        Ruth G. Bonner, mother-in-law of the Soviet physicist Andrei D. Sakharov and a victim of Stalin's purges in the late 1930's, died Friday at the age of 87, her daughter Yelena G. Bonner said today.         Ruth G. Bonner, mother-in-law of the Soviet physicist Andrei D. Sakharov and a victim of Stalin's purges in the late 1930's, died Friday at the age of 87, her daughter Yelena G. Bonner said today.         She said her mother died of a brain hemorrhage in her sleep after a long illness.         Ruth Bonner was an official of the Moscow City Communist Party committee when she was arrested in 1937, and she spent the next 17 years in labor camp or in exile.         Her husband, Georg Alikhanov, then personnel director of Comintern, the Communist International, had been arrested a few days earlier in a mass purge of senior officials of the organization. Like many Comintern colleagues, he was accused of espionage for foreign countries and executed.         Yelena Bonner said her mother, who was among the first of Stalin's victims to be rehabilitated by Khrushchev, was never able to work again after her release in 1954.         Mr. Alikhanov was rehabilitated posthumously.         When Mr. Sakharov and his wife were sent into internal exile to the Volga city of Gorky in 1980 because of their human rights activities, Ruth Bonner was allowed to go to the United States to live with her grandchildren, who had emigrated in the 1970's.         She returned to live with the Sakharovs last June, six months after the Sakharovs were allowed to return to Moscow.         Yelena Bonner said she hoped her son, Alexei, and her daughter, Tatyana, would be granted visas to attend the funeral, which she said would probably be held Tuesday.       
        Sarah Goddard Power, New York City's deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights and social affairs in 1980 and 1981, died in a fall Tuesday from Burton Tower on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was 52 years old and lived in Ann Arbor.         Sarah Goddard Power, New York City's deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights and social affairs in 1980 and 1981, died in a fall Tuesday from Burton Tower on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was 52 years old and lived in Ann Arbor.         The authorities said they believed her fall from the eighth floor of the 212-foot tower was a suicide.         Mrs. Power, an activist for women's rights and world peace, had been a member of the University of Michigan Board of Regents since 1974.         Her husband, Philip, is chairman of the Surburban Communications Corporation in Livonia, Mich., the publisher of 50 newspapers in the Detroit and Cincinnati areas. His family gave $3.9 million to build the Power Center for the Performing Arts on the Ann Arbor campus.         The university's president, Harold T. Shapiro, said yesterday that Mrs. Power's death was ''a great loss for the university, for the state and for those committed to more progressive social policy.'' Michigan's Governor, James J. Blanchard, called her a ''brilliant and vibrant caring person committed to women's rights and equality.''         From 1966 to 1969, Mrs. Power was executive director of the New York City Commission for the United Nations and Consular Corps in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay. She also was executive assistant on Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's personal staff from 1959 to 1963.         She was born in Detroit and was graduated from Vassar College. She also received a diploma in French at the Alliance Francaise in Paris and a master's degree in politics and international relations from New York University in 1965.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Power is survived by a son, Nathan E., at home; her mother, Katharine R. Goddard, of Ann Arbor; a sister, Margery G. Whiteman, of Albany, and two brothers, Russel H. Goddard, of New Haven, and Wendell H. Goddard, of Berkeley, Calif.         Correction:  March 28, 1987, Saturday, Late City Final Edition       
        Ann C. Mersereau, a Manhattan school district superintendent in the 1970's, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in Teaneck, N.J. She was 65 years old.         Ann C. Mersereau, a Manhattan school district superintendent in the 1970's, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in Teaneck, N.J. She was 65 years old.         Mrs. Mersereau, a 40-year veteran of the New York City school system, was superintendent for Community School District 1, on the Lower East Side, from 1974 to April 1975. She also was a teacher and principal in the district.         Later, Mrs. Mersereau was the city's central school district director of the Federal Title VII fund program established under the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibits job discrimination on the basis of sex, race or religion. The central school district encompasses 31 school districts in Brooklyn and Queens.         At her death, she was on leave as principal of Intermediate School 206 in the Bronx.         Mrs. Mersereau was a graduate of North Carolina State University in Raleigh, and she held a master's degree from New York University and a doctorate from Fordham University.         She is survived by her husband, Paul.       
        Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Mrs. Green, a Democrat, started out as a schoolteacher and went on to serve 10 years in Congress.         After defeating Tom McCall, who later became Governor of Oregon, Mrs. Green represented the state's Third Congressional District from 1954 to 1974. She rose to the second-highest position on the House Education and Labor Committee and served as chairwoman of its Subcommittee on Higher Education. In that capacity, she pushed for passage of legislation creating the first Federal scholarships for college undergraduates.         Senator Mark O. Hatfield, a Republican who was a friend of Mrs. Green for 40 years, said yesterday: ''She was probably the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress. On any important legislation, such as women's rights or education or dealing with minorities or poor people, she could switch people's votes on the floor through the power of her intellect and her ability to persuade. People listened because when Edith Green spoke, she spoke from the heart as well as the mind.'' Role in Anti-Poverty Legislation         In 1967, for example, Mrs. Green played a key, though behind-the-scenes, role in passage of major anti-poverty legislation proposed by President Johnson. In large part through her efforts, a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats against the bill was splintered when she drafted and lobbied for an amendment that met the demands of some of the Southerners. Despite those efforts, President Johnson and Mrs. Green did not like each other, largely because of her early opposition to the buildup of troops in Vietnam.         Mrs. Green, a native of South Dakota, went to Willamette University in Salem, Ore., in the late 1920's and, after graduating, started teaching elementary school in Salem, according to a son, James S. Green of Gresham, Ore. She became involved in politics after working with the Oregon Education Association.         She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the platform committee. At the urging of the candidate, she gave a seconding speech for the Presidential nomination of Adlai E. Stevenson. Four years later, she was asked to second the nomination of John F. Kennedy for President. At the time, she was serving as chairman of the Kennedy campaign committee in Oregon. President Kennedy later named her as a member of the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. And he also offered her the ambassadorship to Canada, but she declined. Advocate for Women's Rights         Mr. Green said his mother was a supporter of women's rights, but without stridence. ''She realized that she had to work with the men before she knocked them over,'' Mr. Green said. ''The key is to work with them, she said, and she was very good at it. I think her colleagues would testify to that.''         Mr. Hatfield said Mrs. Green ''probably had more direct personal role in writing education-related legislation than any other person.'' He also described her as ''foremost in the effort to bring about equal pay for equal work.''         And, the Senator continued: ''She also was remarkable in this business that I'm in, in that she could walk away from it, which she did at the height of her career. She did not run again when she could have been re-elected for life.'' Mrs. Green did not seek re-election in 1974.         After retiring, she became a professor of government at Warner Pacific College and in 1976 she served as co-chairwoman of the National Democrats for Gerald Ford. In 1979, she was appointed to serve on the Oregon Board of Higher Education.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Green's survivors include another son, Richard, of Annandale, Va.; two sisters, Ruth Costello of Berkeley Springs, W.Va., and Mildred Cleaveland of San Andreas, Calif.; and four grandchildren. week, but details were not complete yesterday.         EX-REP. EDITH GREEN, 77, IS DEAD       
        Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Judge Polier retired from the bench in 1973 after 38 years in the Family Court, which was known as Domestic Relations Court when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed her to it in 1935.         The daughter of a civil libertarian, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, she was the first woman to hold a judicial office above magistrate in the state.         As a judge, she fought strenuously for an improved Family Court and for better care for the children, especially from poor families, who came before it. She also helped establish a mental-health unit in the court. Children's Rights Advocate         After retiring, she continued her battle for children's rights as a leader of several organizations. She was the director of the juvenile justice division of the Children's Defense Fund, the president of the Marion E. Kenworthy-Sarah H. Swift Foundation and a director of the Tappanz Foundation.         Judge Polier's counsel was sought by other cities and states in developing court services for children and families and she provided similar help to other countries.         She wrote numerous articles and books about the legal and psychiatric problems of dealing with children and families.         During World War II, Judge Polier served as counsel to Eleanor Roosevelt in the Office of Civil Defense in Washington. With Mrs. Roosevelt and others, she helped found the nonsectarian Wiltwyck School for disturbed delinquent children in New York City. Fired for 'Agitating' Workers         Judge Polier was born in Portland, Ore., and her desire to correct social ills showed up early in life. While a sophomore at Radcliffe College, she lived at a settlement house in Boston for underprivileged children. She had also attended Bryn Mawr College.         After transferring to and graduating from Barnard College, she got a job with a woolens mill in Passaic, N.J., from which she was fired for what she later described as ''agitating'' workers who had been forbidden by management to organize.         She studied labor relations in Geneva for a year, then decided to become a lawyer on the advice of her father. He persuaded her to study law, she said years later, ''because I had good intentions but no skills.''         In 1928, she graduated from Yale Law School, where she had married Leon A. Tulin, a professor. He died in 1932. Active in Adoption Issues         After Yale, she served on a state committee to study workers' compensation laws and was an assistant corporation counsel of New York City before she was named a judge.         She was for many years the president of Louise Wise Services, an adoption and child-care agency founded by her mother in 1916.         Judge Polier headed an unofficial citizens commission that in 1974 looked into the alleged paddling of students, at the Jordan L. Mott Junior High School in the Bronx, by two deans. The commission called for an ombudsman, among other measures, to protect pupils against corporal punishment.         Judge Polier was a vice president of the American Jewish Congress and a member of the board, and former president, of the Field Foundation.         Her second husband, Shad Polier, died in 1976. She is survived by two sons, Stephen Wise Tulin of Larchmont, N.Y., and Jonathon Wise Polier of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Trudy Festinger of Manhattan; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
        Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Born in the Clasons Point section of the East Bronx, she held the borough's at-large seat on the Council for more than 17 years. A Democrat, she had been a teacher in the city's school system and had served three and a half terms in the State Legislature before her election to the Council in 1965.         Her political career, which ended in 1983 when the at-large Council seats were abolished, was devoted largely to education and consumer causes. At budget time she often tangled with the Koch administration over what she considered to be meager funds for the public libraries. Author of Food Laws         Her legislative triumphs included the sponsorship of a law to require dairies to place dates on their milk cartons. Another law she sponsored mandated that supermarkets must list unit prices as well as package prices.         As chairwoman of the Council's General Welfare Committee, she was at the center of some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's. She was chairwoman of a series of long public hearings on proposals to require all-male private clubs to admit women.         Her position on measures that sought to guarantee the civil rights of the city's homosexuals was equivocal at times, but her handling of the issue enhanced her reputation as a skilled parliamentarian. In 1978 she scheduled hearings on the rights bill the day after the November election, leading to accusations by proponents of the bill that she had chosen a day when the public and news media would be absorbed in other matters.         On another crucial occasion the bill was stalled in the Welfare Committee when she failed to return from lunch for an important vote, even though supporters of the bill were counting on her vote. Elected to Assembly         Mrs. Ryan went into politics after her husband, E. Gerard Ryan, a lawyer, died. Only a handful of women had served in the New York State Assembly when she was elected to the Legislature in 1958.         She was active in Bronx politics in her 10 years as a teacher, and she was a former vice president of the Siwanoy Democratic Club, now defunct. She was a charter member of the Bronx Historical Society and a member of the League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Ryan was also a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Business and Professional Women's Club of New York and the Order of Our Lady of the Holy Sepulchre.         Born Aileen Barlow, she attended Public School 47 in the Bronx, Cathederal High School, Hunter College and the New York University Law School. Manhattan College awarded an honorary doctorate to her in 1974.         She was a lifelong resident of the Bronx until she moved to Point Lookout, L.I., about two years ago.         She is survived by two sons, Gerald Ryan of Rockville Centre, L.I., and Francis X. Ryan of Muttontown, L.I.; a daughter, Allana Chesney of Point Lookout, and three grandchildren.         A wake will be held today and tomorrow from 2 to 5 P.M. and from 7 to 9 P.M. at O'Shea's Funeral Home in Wantagh, L.I. A funeral mass is scheduled for 10:30 A.M. Wednesday at St. Helena's Roman Catholic Church in the Bronx.

Florence V. Lucas, a former deputy commissioner of the New York State Division of Human Rights, died of cancer Sunday at her home in Rosedale, Queens. She was 71 years old.         Miss Lucas was born in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter College and Brooklyn Law School. She was president of the Queens branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in the late 1950's and early 1960's.         She was appointed a special assistant to the Human Rights Division in 1966, became assistant commissioner and was made deputy commissioner in 1972. She retired in 1975.         In the division, she helped revise the state's human rights law and helped draft the procedures for enforcing it.         Miss Lucas was also a vice president of the Judicial Council, a high-ranking body in the United Methodist Church.         Miss Lucas's married name was Edwards, but she used her maiden name professionally.         She is survived by her husband, D. Rex Edwards; two sisters, Marjorie Smith of Rosedale and Bernice Patterson of Jamaica, Queens; an adopted son, Ralph Barkley of Virginia Beach, Va.; an adopted daughter, Freda Muldoon of Newburyport, Mass., and four grandchildren.

Mrs. Reiner, who graduated from Syracuse University at the age of 64, ran unsuccessfully for mayor, the State Legislature, Congress and other offices as a member of the Onondaga County Liberal Party. In her campaigns, she often drew attention to issues of human services and the threat of nuclear weapons.         She was a member of the National Council of Negro Women, the National Organization for Women, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union. She was an advocate of gay rights and belonged to a number of peace organizatons, including the Syracuse Peace Council.         Her husband, Howard L. Reiner, died in 1960.         She is survived by a son, Lawrence O., of Tuckerton, N.J.; two grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.

        Eleanor M. Johnson, founder of The Weekly Reader, which has brought the news of the world to schoolchildren for nearly six decades, died of cancer Thursday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. She was 94 years old.         Eleanor M. Johnson, founder of The Weekly Reader, which has brought the news of the world to schoolchildren for nearly six decades, died of cancer Thursday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. She was 94 years old.         Miss Johnson, a dedicated and energetic educator for half a century, produced the first issue of the newspaper on Sept. 21, 1928, and remained active in planning its contents until 1978, when she was 85.         Originally called My Weekly Reader, the slim periodical, typically four or eight pages an issue, was read by two-thirds of today's American adults when they were in elementary school, according to the publisher, Fields Publications of Middletown, Conn.         With its clear, straightforward prose, The Weekly Reader has explained to generations of American children the compelling events of the day: the Depression, World War II, assassinations, the Vietnam War, civil rights struggles and the Iran hostage crisis. 'They Were Missing Knowledge'         ''Part of Eleanor's genius was she knew how to connect kids to the world,'' said Terry Borton, The Weekly Reader's editor in chief for the last 10 years.         Miss Johnson conceived the idea of a newspaper for elementary school pupils in 1927, when she was an administrator overseeing curriculum in the public schools of York, Pa.         ''In her work with kids,'' Mr. Borton said, ''she noticed most of the reading they did was fairy tales and fantasy, which she felt was fine, but she felt they were missing a knowledge and understanding of the real world, which she thought they would like.''         She proposed the idea to William Blakey, president of American Education Publications, which already published a newspaper for high school students. He agreed. Hoover vs. Smith         The cover article of the first Weekly Reader profiled the two principal candidates in the 1928 Presidential election, Herbert Hoover and Alfred E. Smith, focusing on their childhood. Its headline said, ''Two Poor Boys Who Made Good Are Now Running for the Highest Office in the World.'' The leading articles in two of the most recent Weekly Readers discussed a controversy over cigarette advertisements and the growing concern about air travel.         Circulation reached 100,000 the first year and grew to a high of 13 million in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when The Weekly Reader expanded to seven editions, one for each grade level from preschool to sixth grade. Nine million schoolchildren subscribe today, at a cost of about $2 for the 27 issues of the school year.         All the while, according to the newspaper's publisher, The Weekly Reader has retained its original aim: ''to present selected, well-written news of interest and value to children with accuracy and fairness, colorful but uncolored.'' A Farmer's Daughter         Eleanor Murdock Johnson was born Dec. 10, 1892, in Washington County, Md., a daughter of a farming couple.         Miss Johnson, a fragile-looking woman who stood about 4 feet 10 inches, began her career in education as a first-grade teacher in Oklahoma. She worked as a consultant to The Weekly Reader during its early years while continuing to hold administrative jobs in York and then in the Lakewood, Ohio, school system.         In 1935, she left public schools to preside over the magazine full time as editor in chief, a job she held until 1961. Then, after retirement, she continued to serve the paper as a consultant until 1978.         Miss Johnson, who held master's degrees in education from the University of Chicago and Columbia University, was also a co-author of several children's books, including the Child Story Readers and the Treasury of Literature Readers, and wrote more than 50 elementary school workbooks that offered exercises in reading, arithmetic and geography. She also wrote numerous articles in education journals and was an active public speaker.         Miss Johnson, whose cancer was diagnosed about a month ago, is survived by a sister, Maria Johnson, with whom she lived at the Herman M. Wilson Health Care Center of the Asbury Methodist Retirement Center in Gaithersburg.         A memorial service will be held Monday afternoon at St. Marks Lutheran Church in Wolfsville, Md.
