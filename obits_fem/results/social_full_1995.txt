         Mabel Olsen Phillips, who was president of the United Nations Delegations Women's Club from 1971 to 1973, died on Monday at Arlington Hospital in Virginia. She was 75 and lived in Washington.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said a daughter, Miriam P. Eley.         Mrs. Phillips worked with a number of social and philanthropic organizations around the world as the wife of a career American diplomat, Christopher H. Phillips.         She was elected president of the cultural, philanthropic and social organization in 1971 while her husband was the Deputy Permanent United States Representative, from 1969 to 1973.         Besides her husband and her daughter, of San Francisco, she is survived by another daughter, Victoria P. Corbett of Manhattan; a son, David W., of Mountain View, Calif., and five grandchildren.       
         Dr. Dorothy V. Whipple, who helped to secure the rights of women in the medical profession and advanced the cause of children through her widely influential work in pediatrics, died Friday at her home in Washington. She was 94.         Dr. Whipple was the first married woman admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School ("They objected on those grounds but finally took me in," she recalled in an interview decades later) and an early advocate of rearing children by using liberal amounts of cuddling and common sense. She graduated in 1929.         "Be natural and easy with your baby," Dr. Whipple wrote in her 1944 book "Our American Babies." In an era when many doctors advocated strict feeding schedules and letting babies cry to exhaustion, Dr. Whipple dared to argue that feeding a baby when it was hungry might be a good idea, and she insisted that love and understanding were what counted: "Nothing we can do or provide for a baby is more important."         As for letting a baby cry on and on, she said, "I found it made a lot of difference to me whose baby was crying."         She was speaking as a mother as well as a professional, a dual role that she played long before it became common. In a 1968 interview, she said it required a sympathetic husband (in her case, the economist Ewan Clague), domestic help and "the constitution of an ox."         Happy to be called "Mrs. Clague" by some friends and neighbors, Dr. Whipple, who grew up in New York City, did not change her name when she married Mr. Clague in 1923, after her graduation from the University of Wisconsin, where she had been a speed skater. She also received a master's degree from Wisconsin before attending Johns Hopkins.         In the New Deal era, Mr. Clague helped organize the Social Security Administration and later served as Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the early 1940's, Dr. Whipple was hired by the Federal Government to revise its popular "Infant Care" pamphlet.         In her revised pamphlet, as in her book and in a syndicated weekly newspaper column on child care, she promoted a nurturing, down-to-earth way with children even as she showed her awareness of common family problems. A grandmother, she wrote, could be a blessing, or "a terrible pain in the neck."         In 1939, Dr. Whipple began a private practice in Arlington, Va., one she continued for 40 years. She was a frequent contributor to professional and popular journals and wrote two other books: "Euthenic Pediatrics" and "Q: Is the Grass Greener? Answers to Questions About Drugs."         The book on drugs was published in 1971 and advocated a more lenient approach to prosecution of marijuana-related crimes because, she argued, criminal sanctions had not stemmed the spread of drug use.         Dr. Whipple's husband died in 1987. She is survived by two sons, Llewellyn Clague of Hastings, N.Y., and Christopher Clague of College Park, Md.; a daughter, Anne Farber of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Sylvia Laibman Horwitz, a world traveler, an author and a founder of two schools, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Paul Horwitz.         When the guns stopped firing in Europe in 1945, Mrs. Horwitz was part of one of the first boatloads of American civilians headed for Italy to join spouses on special assignment on the war-ravaged continent. Her husband, Louis Horwitz, a social worker, was working with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency in the resettlement of refugees.         She quickly found that the disarray of postwar Rome extended to newcomers as well as to survivors. There was no school for English-speaking children, so she helped start one and served as its first director. The Overseas School of Rome is still in operation. She had already helped found the Downtown Community School, a private elementary school in Greenwich Village, in the early 1940's.         Her tenure in Rome also kindled an interest in archeology.         When her husband was posted in Tunisia, she began to explore the past of her new home and the site of ancient Carthage. Study there and later in Tiberias inspired her third book, "The Find of a Lifetime: Sir Arthur Evans and the Discovery of Knossos" (Viking, 1980). It celebrated the discoveries of one of history's greatest amateur archeologists, Arthur Evans, who uncovered evidence of a Minoan civilization in Crete dating back to 3500 B.C.         She also wrote the books "Toulouse-Lautrec: His World" (Harper, 1973) and "Francisco Goya: Painter of Kings and Demons" (Harper, 1974).         She was born in Newcastle, Pa., and grew up in Cleveland. She graduated from Case Western University in 1932 and moved to Manhattan, where she was a copywriter. Later, she was a teacher at the New School for Social Research.         Her husband died in 1979. In addition to her son, of Concord, Mass., she is survived by a sister, Natalie Barr of Lamoine, Me., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  June 26, 1995, Monday         An obituary on Wednesday about Sylvia Laibman Horwitz of Manhattan, an author and founder of two schools who died on June 18, misidentified the college she attended. Mrs. Horwitz graduated in 1932 from Flora Stone Mather College for Women, not from Case Western Reserve University. The women's college later became part of a university that helped form Case Western Reserve University in 1967.       
         Jeanne-Marie Ruth-Rolland, an official of the Central African Republic who served as its Minister of Social Affairs in 1992 and 1993 after being imprisoned for five years for political reasons, died on June 4 in a hospital in Paris. She was 58.         Her death was reported in the Friday issue of Le Monde, which did not give the cause.         She was trained as a teacher and became the director of social services in the republic's army, an adviser to the Prime Minister on women's issues and a campaigner on behalf of homeless children in Bangui, the republic's capital.         Her outspokenness was not tolerated for a time by the republic's military ruler, Gen. Andre Kolingba, who stepped down in 1993. After being imprisoned from 1986 to 1991, she went on to join the Cabinet, but left it before a presidential election in 1993, in which she was an unsuccessful candidate.         She was married and had five children.       
         Louise Reinhardt Smith, a discerning collector of modern art and a prized supporter of the Museum of Modern Art since 1957, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Ms. Smith was one of the last of the strong-willed and independent-minded collectors whose activity was indispensable to the Museum of Modern Art at a time when there was still much new ground to be broken for its core collections.         Agnes Gund, president of the Museum of Modern Art, said yesterday: "Louise Smith brought to art a real, true love. She cared nothing for the social status or the public attention that it could bring. The only people she wanted around her were those who felt for art the way she did.         "Disregarding the safe and the sure, she was drawn to the tough and the difficult in art. Living with the tough pictures in her collection -- the redoubtable Picasso 'Woman Dressing Her Hair' of 1940, for one -- she developed over the years a friendship with them that was deeply moving to witness".         Mrs. Smith's many gifts to the Museum of Modern Art are the subject of an exhibition, "Masterworks From the Louise Reinhardt Smith Collection," which opened at the museum on May 4 and runs through Aug. 22. With the exception of two paintings -- one by Claude Monet, the other by Georges Braque -- that she bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum, everything in the show will now be part of the Modern's permanent collection. Matisse, Degas, Kandinsky and Seurat are among the major artists represented in the exhibition.         Louise Reinhardt Smith was born in Dallas on March 14, 1904. The daughter of Sidney Reinhardt and Alice Blum Reinhardt, she attended Washington University and the College of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio. In 1964, at the age of 60, she obtained her bachelor's degree from New York University.         For many years she wrote short stories for Ladies' Home Journal and other publications and in 1945 received the O. Henry Award. During her marriage to Bertram Smith, an investment broker in New York City, she kept registered Guernsey cows at the couple's farm in the Berkshires. After her husband's death, she began her long association with the Museum of Modern Art and its international council. She was made a trustee of the museum in 1965 and a trustee for life in 1993.         She is survived by a daughter, Ann Smith, and two grandsons, Bertram and Nicholas Nikola; all of Patterson, N.Y., and a sister, Alice Harrington of San Diego.       
         May Sarton, poet, novelist and the strongest of individualists, died on Sunday at the York Hospital in York, Me., the town in which she had lived for many years. She was a stoical figure in American culture, writing about love, solitude and the search for self-knowledge. She was 83.         The cause of death was breast cancer, said Susan Sherman, a close friend and editor of her letters.         During a remarkably prolific career that stretched from early sonnets published in 1929 in Poetry magazine to "Coming Into Eighty" her latest collection of poems, in 1994, Ms. Sarton persistently followed her own path and was nurtured by an inner lyricism. She wrote more than 20 books of fiction and many works of nonfiction, including autobiographies and journals, a play and several screenplays. She was best known and most highly regarded as a poet.         Extremely popular on college campuses, she became a heroine to feminists. In 1965, when she revealed that she was a lesbian, she said she lost two jobs as a result. But as with so much in her life, she had no regrets.         In an interview with Enid Nemy in The New York Times in 1983, Ms. Sarton was described as "a commanding, no-nonsense figure with clear blue eyes and a shock of white hair," a woman who lived in "self-imposed loneliness" in a weathered clapboard house on the Maine coast. She had, it was said, a difficult life; her work has been virtually ignored by major critics and she gained her reputation primarily by word of mouth. The poet said, "Women have been my muse."         Recovering from a stroke, and while often in pain from other ailments, she continued to keep a journal, and in 1993 published "Encore: A Journal of the 80th Year." In it, she said, "I write poems, have always written them, to transcend the painfully personal and reach the universal." She added, "It's hard to say goodbye to journals, and if I live to be 85 I might resume one for the joy of it."         In The New York Times Book Review, the novelist Sheila Ballantyne, reviewing "Anger," Ms. Sarton's 1982 novel, wrote: "It is clear that May Sarton's best work, whatever its form, will endure well beyond the influence of particular reviews or current tastes. For in it she is an example: a seeker after truth with a kind of awesome energy for renewal, an ardent explorer of life's important questions. Her great strength is that when she achieves insight, one believes -- because one has witnessed the struggle that preceded the knowledge."         Ms. Sarton was born in Wondelgem in Belgium in 1914, as Eleanore Marie Sarton. Her father was a Belgian historian of science, her mother an English artist and designer. With the outbreak of World War I, the Sartons emigrated to England and, in 1916, to the United States, where her name was Anglicized to Eleanor May Sarton. As she later recalled in "I Knew a Phoenix: Sketches for an Autobiography," her mother carried with her from Belgium a copy of "Leaves of Grass," and passed on a love of poetry to her daughter.         In 1918, the Sartons settled in Cambridge, Mass. At Shady Hill School in Cambridge, the young woman explored her passion for poetry, and then fell into difficulty at high school because she objected to a teacher's statement that Ibsen was immoral. The fact that she did not go to college was, she said, "a great piece of luck; this way, I'm ignorant but I'm fresh." Stage-struck, she joined Eva Le Gallienne's Civic Repertory Theater as an actress. After the company disbanded in the early 1930's, she founded the Apprentice Theater of the New School for Social Research. When her theater failed, she made frequent trips back to Europe, and continued to re-envision her experiences in poetry.         During the 1930's, two volumes of poetry, "Encounter in April" and "Inner Landscape," and a novel, "The Single Hound," established themes that were to occupy her for a lifetime: the many forms of love and the uniqueness of the individual. To support her art, she wrote book reviews and taught creative writing. Her second novel, "The Bridge of Years," published in 1946, was seemingly drawn from life, dealing with the effect of two world wars on a Belgian family. Many of her subsequent novels, including "The Small Room," "Crucial Conversations" and "A Reckoning," centered on women as protagonists. In these novels as well as in her poems, she confronted issues that foreshadowed feminist writing of subsequent decades.         For Ms. Sarton, poetry was her life's work. As she said: "When you're a poet, you're a poet first. When it comes, it's like an angel." Although she never had the full recognition attained by many of her peers, and never won a Pulitzer Prize or a National Book Award, her work generally received favorable reviews and she had a loyal readership. She was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and received 18 honorary degrees.         In "Encore," she admitted to being hypersensitive about criticism. As she once said, referring to a review of her novel, "A Reckoning," a bad review "is a drop of poison and slowly gets into the system, day by day." But nothing could discourage her from writing, not even a series of illnesses. Through her later years, she chronicled her life in journals. In "After the Stroke," a journal published in 1988, she wrote that she had discovered "for the first time perhaps what it takes to grow old," and, approaching 75, was determined to "recover and go on creating."         Speaking about the "rewards of a solitary life," she said, "Loneliness is most acutely felt with other people, for with others, even with a lover sometimes, we suffer from our differences -- differences of taste, temperament, mood." Quietly she waited for the moment to come "when the world falls away, and the self emerges again from the deep unconscious, bringing back all I have recently experienced to be explored and slowly understood, when I can converse again with my own hidden powers, and so grow, and so be renewed, till death do us part." Of Solitude, Mortality, Liberals, Friends and Fires  Fruit of Loneliness         Now for a little I have fed on loneliness         As on some strange fruit from a frost-touched vine --         Persimmon in its yellow comeliness,         Or pomegranate-juice color of wine,         The pucker-mouth crab apple, or late plum --         On fruit of loneliness I have been fed.         But now after short absence I am come         Back from felicity to the wine and bread.         For, being mortal, this luxurious heart         Would starve for you, my dear, I must admit,         If it were held another hour apart         From that food which alone can comfort it --         I am come home to you, for at the end         I find I cannot live without you, friend.         From "Words on the Wind" ("Encounter in April," Houghton-Mifflin, 1937)         I watched the psychic surgeon         Stern, skilled, adroit,         Cut deep into the heart         And yet not hurt. . . .         Old failures, old obsessions         Cut Away. . . .         From "Letter to a Psychiatrist"         Here in Maine it is a cold start to the new year as a tempestuous ocean throws up fountains of spray at the end of my field and its ice on the dirt roads where I walk Tamas, my dog. But the cold is not only in the weather -- after all, we expect that, and we are bundled up; the cold is in the heart. I cannot remember a year when I was more aware of suffering and need, more aware of the botch governments make of human lives, more aware of my own helplessness as though the fire in me had frozen at the center.         When Tamas comes in from the snow, he shakes himself, and this evening I tell myself, as the moon rises in a brief respite from storm, that I must find a way to shake myself out of the frozen mood and start the fire going again. Hard times tempt one to run for cover and hide, wait it out, give up trying to act in the face of gigantic problems no one of us is equipped to solve. The temptation is to withdraw.         But, I tell myself, that is not what being a liberal is all about, however put down and cast aside we may be at the moment. Anger lights the fire when I see some people hanging their heads, allowing themselves to be persuaded that government cannot concern itself with the poor, the disabled, the old, the children. We may have failed, but if so we failed because we did too little, not too much.         We have got to warm ourselves back to the certainty that it is only when we lose the connection between ourselves and other people that we begin to freeze up into despair. That connection has to be kept open whatever happens. It is kept open by letters, by unexpected encounters, or by simply contemplating the points of light here or there.         From "Winter Thoughts" (The New York Times, 1982)         "Music I heard with you was more than music." Exactly. And therefore music itself can only be heard alone. Solitude is the salt of personhood. It brings out the authentic flavor of every experience.         Loneliness is most acutely felt with other people, for with others, even with a lover sometimes, we suffer from our differences -- differences of taste, temperament, mood. Human intercourse often demands that we soften the edge of perception, or withdraw at the very instant of personal truth for fear of hurting, or of being inappropriately present, which is to say naked, in a social situation. Alone we can afford to be wholly whatever we are, and to feel whatever we feel absolutely.         From "Rewards of a Solitary Life" (The New York Times, 1990)       
         Erika Lehnsen, one of the first art therapists to work with children, died on Sunday at the Andrus retirement home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. Until recently, Miss Lehnsen, who was 90, was a resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         Miss Lehnsen and her associates, including Elinor Ulman and Bernard Levy, were among the founders of the art therapy field.         Born in a small town near Berlin, she studied at an innovative school where practicing artists taught free and applied art. After Nazi persecution prompted her departure from Germany, she joined her brother in Guatemala, where he had founded a boarding school. There, she taught art and art appreciation and discovered her interest in the artwork of young children.         She moved to the United States in 1954 and received a master's degree in psychology at the New School for Social Research. She worked for 14 years at Montefiore Medical Center before retiring 20 years ago.       
         Eleanore Griffin, a Hollywood writer who shared an Academy Award for a story that became part of a political debate more than half a century later, died on Wednesday at the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 91.         In a career that extended from the 1930's to the 60's, Miss Griffin wrote or helped write such movies as "St. Louis Blues," "Good Morning, Miss Dove" and "Imitation of Life," but by far her most significant work was "Boys Town," the 1938 movie in which Father Flanagan, a compassionate Roman Catholic priest (Spencer Tracy) runs a school for a group of endearing juvenile delinquents led by Mickey Rooney.         Miss Griffin and Dore Schary shared an Oscar for best original story.         It was a story whose uplifting message reverberated through the political atmosphere last year when Newt Gingrich, the Speaker of the House of Representatives, cited the movie as evidence that private philanthropic efforts could make up for cuts in Government spending on social benefits.         Miss Griffin, who was born in St. Paul, Minn., worked for a number of studios over the years, developing what amounted to an ecumenical specialty in movies based on religious personalities. In addition to "Boys Town," these included "A Man Called Peter," (1955) about the Presbyterian minister Peter Marshall, and "One Man's Way," a 1964 biography of the Rev. Norman Vincent Peale.       
         Carol Fox Sulzberger, the wife of Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the chairman of The New York Times Company, and an active volunteer with foundations and social-service organizations, died yesterday at her home in Southampton, L.I. She was 68.         The cause of her death was cancer.         Mrs. Sulzberger was a director of the New York City Police Foundation. At one time, she also served on the boards of the National Urban League, the New York Urban League, WAIF/International Social Service, the Girl Scouts of Greater New York and the Cooperative Education Association.         "She carried a very heavy schedule without talking a lot about it," a friend, Margaret Greenfield, said yesterday. "She did a lot of good works in a very quiet way."         Mrs. Greenfield and another friend of many years, Sydney Gruson, said friends would remember Mrs. Sulzberger as a woman who jealously guarded the time she spent with her family, her antiques hunting and her passion for the company and conversation of intimates. "She had a wry sense of humor," Mr. Gruson said. "And she was the most direct, honest woman I have ever known."         An avid reader of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger especially championed its coverage of fashion and the arts.         She was born in New York City, the daughter of Estelle and David Fox. Mr. Fox had been president of Jay Thorpe, a New York women's specialty store that has since closed.         Educated at the Dalton School, she was a graduate of Goddard College in Vermont. In her youth, she spent a number of years with her family in Paris.         In addition to her husband of 39 years, she is survived by two daughters, Cathy, of Chevy Chase, Md., and Cynthia, of New York City, and two stepchildren, Karen, of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Arthur Jr., the publisher of The Times, and seven grandchildren.         A memorial service will be held at 3 P.M. on Tuesday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family said that in lieu of flowers, contributions may be made to the New York City Police Foundation at 345 Park Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10105.       
         Fay Honey Knopp, an advocate of peace and civil rights who founded a Quaker ministry for men and women in prisons around the country, died on Thursday at her home in Shoreham, Vt. A former resident of Westport, Conn., she was 76.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, her family said in reporting her death this week.         A longtime Quaker minister to prisons, Mrs. Knopp retired two years ago as director of the Safer Society Program, which operates under the auspices of the New York State Council of Churches. The program, a national referral service for sex offenders seeking therapy, grew out of her visits to prison and the Prison Research Education Action Program she founded in 1976.         Under her leadership, an affiliated service, the Safer Society Press, produced about 20 books, research studies, manuals and training videos dealing with the treatment and prevention of sex-related crimes and intended for abusers and their victims.         Her affiliation with the Society of Friends dated to a peace demonstration in 1939. She became a Quaker in 1962 and was designated a "minister of record" to serve as a prison visitor throughout the Federal penitentiary system.         Over the years she also served as director of the New York Region of the American Friends Service Committee, projects director for the National Peace Education Division in Philadelphia and counselor to many conscientious objectors.         Prevention of sexual abuse was a major concern in her nearly 40 years of work with prisoners and, she said, she would be "tough with those guys."         "Society has let them off the hook by just locking them up," she told an interviewer in 1988. "I'm very up front with them. Yes, most of them were sexually abused as children, but that can't be an excuse to go out and abuse other people."         A native of Bridgeport, Conn., she studied at the Hartford Art School, the New School for Social Research and the University of California at Los Angeles.         She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Burton; a daughter, Prof. Sari Biklen of Syracuse; a son, State Representative Alex Knopp of Norwalk, Conn.; two sisters, Isabelle Yolen and Sylvia Wittenberg, both of Laguna Beach, Calif.; a brother, Leonard Irving of Fairfield, Conn., and four grandchildren.       
         Joyce Steins, a supporter of the arts and social causes who owned and operated several trendy Manhattan restaurants before retiring three years ago, died on Sunday in Riverhead Hospital on Long Island. A West Side resident, she was 52.         The cause was breast cancer, O. Aldon James Jr., a close friend, said.         Most recently she was the founder, owner and operating manager of Cafe Iguana on Park Avenue South, at 19th Street, a multilevel 225-seat Tex-Mex restaurant that had a strong following. Ms. Steins, the self-styled Mama Iguana, often went from table to table, extending personal greetings and chatting with regulars. The restaurant went out of business with her retirement.         She was born in Manhattan, and graduated with degrees in English and anthropology from the University of Hawaii. She was working on the staff of the American Museum of Natural History when a restaurateur interested her in the business. Changing course, she became a bus girl.         Twenty years later, in the early 1970's, she became an owner of El Rio Grande on East 38th Street, followed by Le Bar Bat on West 57th Street, a restaurant decorated with flying bats of blue, handblown glass. She later sold her stakes in them. Both remain in business.         She used her establishments for fund-raisers to benefit arts organizations and agencies combating AIDS, multiple sclerosis and child abuse.         Ms. Steins is survived by her sister, Loretta Friedman of West Hampton, L.I.       
         Phyllis Brooks, a popular film and stage actress in the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in Cape Neddick, Me. She was 80.         Miss Brooks, a native of Boise, Idaho, started her career as an artist's model in New York, posing for the magazine illustrator James Montgomery Flagg and others. Hollywood discovered her in 1934 as the "Ipana toothpaste girl," and she appeared in Sidney Toler's Charlie Chan series and the Shirley Temple films "Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm" and "Little Miss Broadway." Unhappy with her roles, she tried her luck on Broadway, and succeeded with the George S. Kaufman-Edna Ferber play "Stage Door" (1936) and the hit Ethel Merman musical "Panama Hattie" (1940).         Miss Brooks, who was engaged at one time to Cary Grant, married Torbert H. Macdonald, a wealthy former college football star and hero of World War II, in 1945. He and John F. Kennedy had been college roommates at Harvard.         The Macdonalds settled in Malden, Mass., where Mr. Macdonald was elected to Congress in 1954. He served 11 straight terms, until his death in 1976.         Miss Brooks was active in promoting her husband's political career and that of Kennedy, who was their elder son's godfather. While she declined to move to Washington, she was a frequent hostess on the social scene, especially after Kennedy became President.         She is survived by two sons, Torbert Jr., of York, Me., and Brian, of Salem, Mass.; two daughters, Laurie, of Everett, Mass., and Robin, of Kennebunk, Me.; a brother, Norman Brooks of Cushing, Me., and eight grandchildren.       
         Helen K. Nearing, who with her husband, Scott Nearing, wrote about leaving the congested streets of Manhattan to find peace and happiness through hard work and self-sufficiency on a New England farm, died on Sunday in an automobile accident near her home in Harborside, Me. She was 91.         Mrs. Nearing, whose husband died at 100 in 1983, had continued to live alone in the farmhouse they built 40 years ago overlooking Penobscot Bay. She was killed when a car she was driving struck a tree, said Eliot Coleman, a friend who lives on a neighboring farm.         Between them, Mrs. Nearing and her husband wrote more than 50 books during their half-century of homesteading, including "Living the Good Life" and "Continuing the Good Life," written initially in pamphlet form and then published by Schocken in 1954 and 1970, respectively.         Although written shortly after the Depression, both books became primers for thousands of urbanites who dropped out of the corporate world in the early 1970's and headed for the quiet countryside.         Followers describe the Nearings as the "senior gurus" of the back-to-the-land movement.         "Materialism does not produce happiness," Mrs. Nearing told those who came to tour her Forest Farm and marvel that, in an age of mass communications, she still made do without radio or television.         "She gave in and had a telephone installed about 10 years ago so she could keep in touch with all her friends around the world," said Mr. Coleman, who with his wife, Barbara Damrosch, is host of a cable television series called "Natural Gardening."         A lifelong vegetarian, Mrs. Nearing also did not take aspirin or use a credit card. Instead, she helped to restore the soil of her farm, build a stone farmhouse and outbuildings and plant an organic garden. In her pantry, she filled barrels with flour and sugar, much like New England dwellers a hundred or more years before her.         "In November, the rafters in our big country kitchen are hung with braids of onions and shallots, with ears of dried corn, with drying herbs (mint, tarragon, thyme, parsley, celery, sage and lovage)," she once wrote in a letter to The New York Times.         "Of bottled canned goods in the kitchen cellar, we have 160 quarts of vegatable soup and tomato juice, 132 quarts of rose hips, 80 quarts of applesauce, 146 quarts of raspberries, and jars and jars of jam," she wrote.         Mrs. Nearing drew a parallel between the people who immigrated to New England in the 1700's and "the many young people of today who find no satisfactory way to exercise or develop their talents and interests in modern city or suburb."         "They are willing and eager to clear their land, build their homes, dig and cultivate their own gardens and subsist on their own work," she said. "They are finding out that it is possible to live daily self-sufficient lives even in the middle of the 20th century."         Believing in the adage "waste not, want not," she wrote about all her experiences, providing New Age homesteaders with 10- and 20-year projects leading toward "the good life."         "The Maple Sugar Book," which she wrote with her husband and which was published by Schocken in 1950, told not only of the art and history of sugaring but also of the practical details of sugar making.         Another primer, "Building and Using Our Sun-Heated Greenhouse," published in 1971 by Dutton and now out of print, told of how to grow vegetables year-round in New England without artificial heating.         Among the books that Mrs. Nearing wrote alone were "Wise Words on the Good Life" (Schocken, 1983) and "Simple Food for the Good Life" (Stillpoint, 1983), which she described as "an anti-cooking book that advocates fresh raw foods and minimal cooking."         Her latest work, to be published this month by Tilbury House, "Light on Aging and Dying," is a collection of quotations inspired by the death of her husband 12 years ago.         Mrs. Nearing, who was born in Ridgewood, N.J., graduated from Ridgewood High School, then traveled extensively aboard, studying the violin, which she gave up for gardening when she married Mr. Nearing.         The Nearings began their long journey in search of the good life in 1932, when Mr. Nearing, a professor of economics, left the academic world and moved far away from New York City and the Depression to the wilderness of Vermont, where they built their first farm.         Twenty years later, feeling crowded by a nearby ski lift and growing tourism, they headed for Maine.  They kept a car and a pickup truck but permitted no machines on the farm that were not run by human or animal power.         According to the Nearings' wishes, an education and retreat center is to be established on Forest Farm after their deaths. The nonprofit center, to be called the Good Life Center, is to be administered and financed in part by the Trust for Public Land of Boston, an organization that preserves rural sites and crafts.         The Social Science Institute, formed in 1953 to print political and economic pamphlets written by Mr. Nearing, will become part of the Good Life Center.         Mrs. Nearing is survived by a sister, Alice Vaughan of Dorset, Vt.; a niece, Barbara Tuttle, and a nephew, C. B. Vaughan, both of Dorset, and a stepson, Robert Nearing of Troy, Pa.         A memorial service will be held at 2 P.M. on Sunday, Oct. 1, at the Brookville Community Center in South Brookville, Me.       
         Dorothy Dickson, an American-born musical comedy performer who captivated British audiences in the 1920's and 30's and became a member of the country's theatrical and social elite, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 102.         Until her friend Michael Thornton, the British biographer, tracked down her birth certificate, it had been assumed that Miss Dickson was born on July 20, 1900, the date given in a standard reference work.         But that would have made her a mere 14 in 1914, when as a Chicago debutante she scandalized North Shore society by dropping out of Madame Young's finishing school to form a dance team with Carl Hyson, a wealthy young man who later became her husband.         Before the season was over the pair claimed a long-distance tango record by dancing the equivalent of 22,000 miles at clubs in Chicago, Milwaukee and New York.         A 1900 birth date would also have meant that Miss Dickson was only 16 on Feb. 20, 1917, when she opened as a featured dancer in "Oh Boy!," a Jerome Kern hit that ran for 463 performances at the Princess Theater in New York.         Although she became a Ziegfeld girl and appeared in other Broadway shows, including Kern's "Rock-a-Bye Baby" in 1918, it was not until she got to England in 1921 as the lead in the London company of "Sally" that she became a star. Playing the part made famous by Marilyn Miller in New York a year earlier, Miss Dickson introduced the Kern standard "Look for the Silver Lining" to British audiences, and was a darling of the West End from then on.         She and the show were so successful that Kern and P. G. Wodehouse wrote another one especially for her. "The Cabaret Girl" ran for 361 performances at the Wintergarden Theater there.         It was during the "Cabaret Girl" run that Miss Dickson made one of her most important British conquests, a lasting friendship with Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who was so enchanted with Miss Dickson that she took her fiance to a performance. The fiance, then the Duke of York, eventually became King George VI. The former Lady Elizabeth is the Queen Mother of Britain.         At a birthday lunch Miss Dickson gave at her home in 1980, the Queen Mother demonstrated her own musical-comedy talents by singing a "Cabaret Girl" tune, "Dancing Time." She sent roses for Miss Dickson's 100th-birthday celebration two years ago.         Miss Dickson appeared in many other London productions, including a 1925 revival of "Peter Pan." She also became friends with Noel Coward and other theater luminaries. When she filed for divorce from Mr. Hyson in 1935, it was reported that Miss Dickson was expected to marry a British peer. In fact she never remarried.         Although her career had faded considerably by the 1940's, Miss Dickson re-emerged as a founder of the London Stage Door Canteen, which entertained thousands of Allied troops during World War II.         Her last theater roles were in "Red Letter Day" and "As Long as They Are Happy," in 1953, and she made her last stage appearance in 1980 during a 75th-anniversary celebration of "Peter Pan."         A dedicated Christian Scientist who made daily walks from her Eaton Square apartment to a reading room until she was well into her 90's, Miss Dickson remained a familiar and sprightly figure in London.         In addition to Miss Quayle, she is survived by her daughter, Lady Quayle, the widow of the actor Anthony Quayle; two other grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 29, 1995, Friday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Wednesday about Dorothy Dickson, a former musical comedy star, referred incompletely to one survivor. She is the actress Jenny Quayle, a granddaughter.       
         Lita Annenberg Hazen, a major philanthropist in medical research whose interests encompassed art, music and education, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by complications from lung cancer, a grandson, Nicholas Polsky, said.         Mrs. Hazen had what her daughter, Cynthia Hazen Polsky, called "a great passion for family" and took a personal interest in the activities she supported. She was a friend of most of the scientists whose institutions she helped, and although she was rarely seen at the glittering social events favored by her peers, she had an active social life centered on the arts and science community.         "Medical discoveries were the most exciting and important things that she could imagine, and I don't remember her ever thinking differently or anything that competed with that," Mrs. Polsky said. "She always envisioned that someone would have a better answer."         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust played an important part in numerous medical and scientific programs on both coasts and made significant contributions to cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Opera.         The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island was one of Mrs. Hazen's principal interests. Hazen Tower, a building at the laboratory, commemorates her participation as a founding donor of its Neuroscience Center.         "Lita Hazen was a wonderful patron of pure science, who enjoyed bright and unusual people who would say things that she wouldn't expect," said Dr. James Watson, the Nobel laureate who is director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. .         Dr. Richard A. Lerner, president of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif, said: "She, like Mary Lasker, was one of the great ladies of American science. These kinds of individuals play important roles in science, far beyond the simple ability to donate money. In fact, they become a magnet around which scientists gather."         Dr. Lerner added, "We are losing our 'great ladies of science,' " and he noted that with their death and with no such new individuals on the horizon, "there will not be much to replace them, and a whole culture that fostered science will come to an end."         The Hazen Trust made possible the purchase of land for a science park at the institute and also financed a chair in immunochemistry. A three-building complex at the institute, to be dedicated on Oct. 15, was named in honor of Mrs. Hazen.         Mrs. Hazen was the sixth of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, who founded Triangle Publications and whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, the Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television interests. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom donated considerable portions of their inherited wealth to public institutions. Her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to Great Britain, is a major benefactor of art institutions, and a sister, Enid Haupt of New York, has devoted much of her fortune to public gardens and horticultural institutions, as well as museums and libraries.         In 1963, Mrs. Hazen was a founding sponsor of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, served as a trustee of its medical center from 1976 and contributed, with her siblings, to the construction of the 33-story Annenberg Building at the center, devoted to medical care, education and research. She also provided support for a neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Mount Sinai Medical Center that was named after her and, from 1979 to 1985, a $100,000 annual award for excellence in clinical research. The award, also named for her and administered by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, was divided between the winner and a young medical scientist chosen by the winner.         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Trust, created in 1952, also established significant scholarships and professorships at Mount Sinai, including the Moses L. and Sadie C. Annenberg Professorship in Molecular Biology, the Annenberg Scholarships in Cardiology and the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professorship in Immunochemistry.         Two grants of $1 million each helped establish and finance the Neurosciences Institute and Neurosciences Research Foundation at Rockefeller University in New York. The grants enabled multidisciplinary groups of scientists from around the world to meet and discuss their work. An atrium garden at the university was named in her honor.         In 1980, she initiated a biomedical workshop program at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and a fellowship that paid for the participation of scientists, physicians and administrators. The workshops were also held at other venues, in Stockholm, Venice and at the University of California at Los Angeles and at San Francisco.         Dr. Martin Meyerson, a former president of the University of Pennsylvania who was chairman of the workshops for a decade, noted that she insured that participants ranged from Nobel laureates to junior scientists and that "she relished providing a bit of luxury to them, a good dinner, putting them up in pleasant places."         Dr. Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton University who was a longtime friend, said: "She had a remarkable mind, and had she been born in another generation, she might well have done something herself. She understood what research was about, even in its beginning and theoretical stage."         Mrs. Hazen was born in Milwaukee on Oct. 30, 1909, and attended the Calhoun School in New York. In 1936, she married Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer, film producer, art collector and philanthropist at a double ceremony in which Mrs. Hazen's sister, Enid, was married to the investment banker Ira Haupt.         Mr. Hazen, a former vice president and director of Warner Brothers, wrote the contract between the studio and Edison Vitaphone that resulted in "The Jazz Singer," the first movie with sound. Later, he and Hal B. Wallis, the producer, became partners. Their company, Wallis-Hazen Productions, made films like "Come Back, Little Sheba," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" and "True Grit." During that period, the 1940's to 60's, Mrs. Hazen spent several months each year in Beverly Hills.         It was Mr. Hazen's admiration for Edward G. Robinson's collection of paintings that encouraged Mr. Hazen to become a collector and amass a considerable collection of 20th-century art, including work by Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Leger, Kandinsky, Braque and Picasso. The Joseph H. Hazen Foundation still contributes to a number of arts institutions.         "My mother's interest in art developed with her marriage to my father," Mrs. Polsky said. "My father was more passionate about art but my mother also loved museums and paintings. She was particularly interested in the Impressionists."         Mrs. Hazen's trust made sizable contributions to arts institutions, particularly the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In most cases, the trust provided the funds for purchases, among them two important South Indian bronzes, a 14th-century "Yashoda and Krishna" and an 11th-century "Shiva, Parvati and their son Skanda," for the museum's Irving Galleries of South and Southeast Asian Art.         Mrs. Hazen and her husband also established the Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratory in Oncology and Hematology, in memory of their other daughter, at the Marion Davies Hospital, a unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center. Mrs. Cherry died of lymphoma in 1965 at the age of 32.         Mr. Hazen died in 1994 at age 94, after 58 years of marriage. Mrs. Hazen is survived by Mrs. Polsky of Manhattan; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; a brother, Walter H. Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and three sisters, Mrs. Haupt, Janet Hooker and Evelyn Hall of Manhattan.         Correction:  October 4, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Lita Annenberg Hazen, a leading philanthropist in medical research, misstated her age in some editions. She was 85, not 86.       
         Marilyn J. Morheuser, the lawyer at the center of a 13-year court struggle to make New Jersey's school-financing system more equitable for the state's poorest districts, died on Sunday at her home in Newark. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, according to the Education Law Center, a Newark-based public-interest organization of which she had been executive director since 1979.         Ms. Morheuser was the agency's lead counsel for the plaintiffs in Abbott v.  Burke, a class-action suit brought in 1981 to challenge the state's Quality Education Act of 1980. Arguing on behalf of pupils of the poorest urban schools, the suit asserted that the state had inadequately responded to a State Supreme Court ruling on school financing in 1973. That ruling said that New Jersey's method of school financing violated the State Constitution by failing to guarantee parity between the poorest and the most affluent districts.         The court -- the state's highest -- agreed with the center, ruling in 1990 that the law was still unconstitutional because it did not meet the educational  needs of disadvantaged city children. It ordered that those needs be met.         The law center returned to court the next year, this time to obtain a compliance order, which the Supreme Court in Trenton handed down in 1994. In it, the judges decided that the state must increase the financing of the 30 poorest  districts to a level where their per-pupil outlays would equal the average of the wealthiest districts by fiscal year 1996-97.         The judges demanded that schools in hard-pressed cities like Newark, Camden and Paterson be provided preschool programs, health services and smaller class sizes. The state has the responsibility to provide them rather then leave it up  to the impoverished districts, they wrote.         Ms. Morheuser did not start her professional life at the bar; a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Webster College, she first was a nun. She spent 16 years teaching high school and college around the country, wherever her teaching Roman Catholic order, the Sisters of Loretto, sent her.         Being of a rather radical bent on social issues, she decided that she could achieve more on the outside. She quit the order in 1963 and became an advocate for racial equality in Milwaukee.         In 1973, she received her J.D. at the Rutgers-Newark School of Law. Before she joined the Newark law center she represented such organizations as the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, the Urban League and the National  Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Her work attracted many honors, including a Special Achievement Award from the New Jersey Education Association in 1993, and the Martin Luther King Jr. Award from the National Education Association last year. Last May, she was cited as Woman of the Year in Education by the New Jersey League of Women Voters.         Ms. Morheuser is survived by a sister, Marie Casey of St. Louis.       
         Kate Witte Ericson, an artist who collaborated with her husband, Mel Ziegler, on indoor and outdoor installation works noted for their beauty, complexity and  social awareness, died on Sunday at her home in Milanville, Pa. She was 39 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was brain cancer, her husband said.         Ms. Ericson was born in Manhattan in 1955. She earned a bachelor of fine arts degree from the Kansas City Art Institute in 1978 and a master's from the California Institute of the Arts in 1982. She and Mr. Ziegler met as undergraduates and began working together in 1978, developing a style that featured provocative accumulations of materials and ideas, many of them involved with architecture, American history and the economy.         One of their first solo shows, at the Los Angeles Institute of Contemporary Art in 1986, consisted of a display of all the wood necessary to raise a house,  with each piece carved with a phrase or adage about house or home. At the end of the exhibition, the wood was sold and used in the construction of a house.         Ms. Ericson and Mr. Ziegler exhibited their work in many shows in the United  States and abroad, including the 1989 Whitney Biennial. Their most recent New York exhibition was in 1993 at the Michael Klein Gallery in SoHo.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Ericson is survived by her parents, H. A. and Alma Ericson, of Norwalk, Conn., and a brother, Scott, of Arlington, Tex.       
         Mary Beame, the wife of former Mayor Abraham D. Beame, died on Tuesday at the New York Medical Center. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Beame was married to the former New York Mayor, who served from 1974 to  1978, for almost 68 years. The two met as teen-agers at the University Settlement House, which provided social services for poor Lower East Side residents.         They married in 1928, and Mr. and Mrs. Beame lived in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, for more than four decades, until he became Mayor.         Active in charities, she formed the Jennie Levine Cancer League in memory of  a friend who had died of cancer. She was named Woman of the Year in 1973 by the  National Committee for the Furtherance of Jewish Education.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Edmond, of Hamilton, Ontario, and Bernard, of Chappaqua, N.Y.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Edith Haggard, a New York literary agent whose clients ranged from an important group of proper British writers to the cantankerous Sinclair Lewis, died on Thursday in the Whitney Pavilion of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         In her 30-year career, Mrs. Haggard, who spent five years with the William Morris agency's literary department before joining the Curtis Brown agency in 1937, became one of the city's best-known agents, representing clients like Adela Rogers St. Johns, Nunnally Johnson, Phyllis McGinley, Vera Caspary and Ogden Nash.         A small blond woman whose delicate features were once likened to porcelain,  Mrs. Haggard, whose decidedly fragile appearance belied a will of steel, was also a central figure in the literary social whirl.         Invitations to her annual New Year's Eve parties were coveted, in part because of the number of her famous clients and other acclaimed poets and novelists who would inevitably be present and in part because she was a particularly thoughtful hostess. Mindful that cabs are hard to come by in the wee hours of New Year's Day, she engaged a car and driver for the evening so that her guests could get home.         In addition to a long list of American clients, Mrs. Haggard handled sales to American magazines for several British authors, including C. P. Snow and Daphne  Du Maurier. Her other British authors included Joyce Cary, Richard Llewellyn and Rumer Godden.         In an era when leading magazines had voracious appetites for short fiction, she served almost as an adjunct editor at The Saturday Evening Post, making weekly trips to its headquarters in Philadelphia.         Mrs. Haggard, whose parents, Caroline Briggs and Victor Zorn, were from New Orleans, was born in New York and graduated from Brooklyn Heights Seminary before beginning her literary career, initially at Delineator magazine. There she became associate editor and fell in love with her boss, Sewell Haggard, the  magazine's editor, who died five months after their marriage in 1937.         Mrs. Haggard, who had had a brief teen-age marriage that ended in divorce, was only 34, but she never married again. For the rest of her life she was listed in the Manhattan telephone directory as Mrs. Sewell Haggard.         After her retirement in 1962, she liked to reminisce about her former clients, none of whom, by her account, gave her as much trouble as Sinclair Lewis, a notoriously irascible man, especially when he had been drinking.         She is survived by a niece, Phyllis Lockwood of Anderson, Ind., and two great-nieces, Pamela Herring of Darien, Conn., and Gail Holey of Vienna, Va.

After her retirement in 1962, she liked to reminisce about her former clients, none of whom, by her account, gave her as much trouble as Sinclair Lewis, a notoriously irascible man, especially when he had been drinking.         There was some evidence that Mr. Lewis felt remorseful about his abusive treatment of his long-suffering agent. When he died in 1951 he left her a legacy in his will.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Dorothy Jeakins, who won three Academy Awards for costume design while collaborating with directors like John Huston and Victor Fleming and stars like  Ingrid Bergman and Ava Gardner, died on Nov. 21 at a nursing home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 81 and lived in Montecito, Calif.         In the course of a long career, Ms. Jeakins designed costumes for films including "Samson and Delilah," "The Night of the Iguana," "The Sound of Music," "The Way We Were," "The Misfits," "Reflections in a Golden Eye," "The Ten Commandments," "The Greatest Show on Earth," "The Music Man," "Elmer Gantry" and "Catch-22."         Besides winning three Oscars, she was nominated 12 times for Academy Awards. Her honors were all the more unusual because unlike such better-known designers  as Edith Head, who supervised all of Paramount's movies for decades, Ms. Jeakins was never on the payroll of a major studio for more than one movie at a time.         In addition to Huston, with whom she made six movies, and Fleming, whose "Joan of Arc" brought her the first Academy Award for costume design, in her first major work on a film, Ms. Jeakins worked with such directors as Cecil B. DeMille, Martin Ritt, Robert Wise and William Wyler.         "I was always a director's designer more than an actor's designer," she said  as she reflected on her career a few years ago. "My work was literary."         "What concerns me most is the canvas," she said. "The canvas is the script, and the designer is the painter. What colors do you put on the canvas and why?"         (She said the only fan letter she ever received from an actor came from Sean  Connery, after she dressed him for "The Molly Maguires," a 1970 film about a secret society of Irish mine workers in 19th-century Pennsylvania. "Your clothes made me feel like a coal miner," he wrote.)         Besides her Academy Award for the 1948 release "Joan of Arc," with Bergman and Jose Ferrer, Ms. Jeakins won Oscars for DeMille's "Samson and Delilah" (1948), with Victor Mature and Hedy Lamarr, and Huston's "Night of the Iguana,"  (1964), with Richard Burton, Gardner and Deborah Kerr.         Ms. Jeakins's work was not confined to Hollywood. In New York, she designed for stage productions including "South Pacific," "Affairs of State," "King Lear" (with Louis Calhern), "Too Late the Phalarope," "Major Barbara," "Winesburg, Ohio" and "The World of Suzie Wong." For television, she costumed Mary Martin in "Annie Get Your Gun" and Audrey Hepburn and Mel Ferrer in "Mayerling."         Ms. Jeakins was curator of textiles at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art from 1967 to 1970. She went to Japan on a Guggenheim fellowship in 1961 to study traditional Japanese costume in Noh drama, and created pencil drawings, textile collages and watercolors that were exhibited in galleries and museums.         To all practical purposes she retired about five years ago, after serving as  adviser to the costume department at Santa Barbara City College, her son Peter Dane said.         Ms. Jeakins was born on Jan. 11, 1914 in San Diego. When she was 5, she said  in 1988, her father, who wore expensive clothes and lived in cheap apartments, took her from her mother and hid her in a series of foster homes.         "To this hour I don't know what happened to my mother," Ms. Jeakins said. "She was a couture dresser. She made tea gowns."         Ms. Jeakins grew up in Los Angeles and won a scholarship to the Otis Art Institute. Like many other artists, she was employed during the Depression by the Work Projects Administration. For a time she worked for Walt Disney Studios  drawing Mickey Mouse. Later she drew fashion designs for the I.  Magnin department store, an assignment that caught the eye of Richard Dey, a motion picture art director, who introduced her to Fleming.         Fleming hired the gawky, painfully shy Ms. Jeakins in 1947 as a sketch artist for "Joan of Arc," his film adaptation of Maxwell Anderson's play. Most costume  artists need sketch artists to transfer their ideas to paper. On the Fourth of July weekend, Ms. Jeakins recalled, "My life was altered in an instant."         Fleming, whose manner was considered rough and terrifying, dismissed his designer, Karinska, and insisted that Ms. Jeakins create the costumes for "Joan  of Arc."         To experts, the Jeakins touch was unmistakable. The producer and director John Houseman, for whom she designed on Broadway and at the Shakespeare Festival in Stratford, Conn., said he knew after five minutes of watching Huston's final  film, "The Dead," in 1988, that Ms. Jeakins was the costume designer.         "It was in the way she adapts to the characters," Houseman said then. "She very seldom tries to impose her own quirks or ideas on the actors. She works for the script rather than the flash."         "The costumes in 'The Dead' have no crimson, no blue, no green no violet," Ms. Jeakins said of her work on the film adaptation of James Joyce's short story. "I used mud colors -- olive, nutmeg, clove, persimmon, faded red -- the colors of real life, to get the kind of oppressive quality in Dublin social life. They conveyed lamplight and the dour color of a Dublin house."         Summing up her work, Ms. Jeakins once said: "In the middle of the night, I can put my world down to two words: 'Make beauty.' It's my cue and my private passion."         A marriage in 1940 to Raymond Eugene Dane, a publicity director for 20th Century Fox, ended in divorce in 1946.         In addition to her son Peter Dane, of Las Vegas, she is survived by another son, Stephen Dane of Los Angeles, and a half-brother, Allan Willet of Carlsbad,  Calif.       
         Evangeline Bruce, the widow of one of the most influential diplomats of the cold war and one of Washington's last grand hostesses, died on Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 77.         Mrs. Bruce -- whose husband, David K. E. Bruce, was the United States envoy to France, Germany, Britain, China and NATO before his death in 1977 -- was known for her legendary soirees at their Georgetown home, at once properly old-fashioned and glitteringly up to the minute. Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis once sent her a note praising "the bright path you cut through an age where so few people have grace and imagination and the virtues of another time."         Mrs. Onassis added: "One was so proud as an American to think that other countries recognized you as our very best."         Mrs. Bruce's A-list guests were politicians, literati and celebrities whose names often turned up in newspaper articles, diplomatic cables or campaign-contribution reports: Katharine Graham, Vernon E. Jordan, David Brinkley, Arthur Schlesinger Jr., Arianna Stassinopolous Huffington.         But despite her undisputed place at the center of Washington's social whirl for nearly 50 years, she shunned what she called the "H" word.         "Hostess -- that one I really resent," she once said. She was equally adamant that she did not preside over a salon.         "I don't think any gathering in Washington includes the main ingredients of a salon," she said in 1984. "The French would say that a salon is like- minded people getting together to converse on literature, art, history and politics. The tone has to be light, humorous, witty and, the more elusive the reference, the more prized. In Washington we don't go in for elusive statements. We are not particularly well-read and therefore even the deft allusions are lost."         Instead, Mrs. Bruce said, the talk in Washington tended to be "strictly nuts  and bolts."         "It is rare here to discuss things in conceptual or philosophical terms," she said. "I like living here better than anyplace else in the world, but the first  thing I notice when I leave to spend some time in Europe is the conversation, the variety, the nonphilistine approach."         A diplomat's daughter who had lived in a dozen countries before going to Radcliffe in 1937 to study Chinese history and French literature, Mrs. Bruce moved to London during World War II to work in the London office of the O.S.S.,  the predecessor of the Central Intelligence Agency. One day her boss began questioning her about the languages she spoke.         "I suppose you speak Italian," he said. She said yes.         "German." She nodded.         "French." Again, yes.         "Well, you certainly don't speak Japanese and Chinese," he said.         "Well," she said, "it happens that I do, sir, because my father was stationed in both countries."         With that, David K. E. Bruce invited her to lunch.         "I know it's a tired old cliche," Mrs. Bruce told Vanity Fair magazine, "but  we were partners in every sense of the word. For instance, from day one in Paris, David expected me to be solely responsible for all the diplomatic entertaining, which forced me to get over my shyness."         Her husband, who worked for every President from Harry S. Truman to Gerald R. Ford, was called out of retirement to head the American delegation at the Paris  peace talks on Vietnam in 1970, and again in 1973 to be chief of the United States mission to Beijing. There Mrs. Bruce learned to address Chinese as "comrade," except when speaking to two male servants who were addressed as "mister."         In China, Mrs. Bruce found that she had more time to herself than in earlier  postings. She spent some of it writing a book-length manuscript about the year 1795 in France.         She lined up a publisher but shelved the project until a couple of years ago, when she rewrote the manuscript as "Napoleon and Josephine: An Improbable Marriage." Its publication by Lisa Drew/Scribner earlier this year was met with  interest in some quarters, incredulity in others. William Doyle, in The New York Times Book Review, called it "an extremely readable account of their lives together, and an easy and attractive introduction to Napoleon and his private life" despite a number of errors of fact, date and sequence.         Mrs. Bruce started a Washington organization for runaways and abused teen-agers, the Sasha Bruce Youthwork Inc., in the 1970's. It was named for Mrs. Bruce's 28-year-old daughter, Alexandra, who was known as Sasha and was shot to  death on the family estate in Virginia in 1975. Her husband of three months was  later indicted. By then he had moved to Athens and, as a Greek national, he could not be extradited.         Mrs. Bruce is survived by two sons, David Jr. and Nicholas.       
         Dr. Renata A. Calabresi, a clinical psychologist who was active in the anti-Fascist underground in Italy in the 1930's, died last Friday at her home in New Haven, Conn. She was 96.         Dr. Calabresi, who was born in Ferrara, received her Ph.D. from the University of Florence in 1923 and went to teach at the University of Rome. With her brother, Dr. Massimo E. Calabresi, she helped publish and distribute the leading underground newspaper of the Italian Resistance, Non Mollare (Don't Give Up) and was jailed for a time by the Mussolini Government.         She fled Italy and arrived in the United States in 1940, initially teaching  at the New School for Social Research and Hunter College. In 1947 she joined the Veterans Administration in Newark and worked as a clinical psychologist and coordinator for the training of future psychologists until her retirement in 1969.         Dr. Calabresi is survived by two nephews, Dr. Paul Calabresi of Barrington, R.I., and Judge Guido Calabresi of Woodbridge, Conn. Her brother, a former professor of medicine at Yale University, died in 1988.       
         Eleanor Brown Gambee, a horticulturist, writer and civic worker, died on Saturday at her home in Englewood, N.J. She was 91.         For five decades, Mrs. Gambee devoted her time and active support to the New  York Botanical Garden. As a lecturer and freelance writer, she discussed herbs and horticulture and contributed articles to horticultural journals and other publications.         She was a past vice president of the Planned Parenthood Association of Bergen County, president of the Herb Society of America and member of the editorial board of Vassar Alumnae Magazine.         Mrs. Gambee, who was born in Manhattan, graduated from Vassar College and did postgraduate work at the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. She  was a past trustee of the Dwight-Englewood School in Englewood, the Social Service Federation of Englewood and other community organizations.         Mrs. Gambee is survived by three sons, Sumner, of San Pedro, Calif., Craig, of Nantucket, Mass., and Robert, of Rye, N.Y.; a daughter, Fay Gambee of Manhattan, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren. Her husband, A. Sumner Gambee, died in 1978.       
         Suzanne Storrs Pincus, a community volunteer active in social services and the arts, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 60.         She died after a lengthy illness, her family said.         Mrs. Pincus was a director of the Citizens' Committee for Children, a board member and past president of the Auxiliary of Montefiore Medical Center and a founder of the Professional Committee of Elem-Youth in Distress in Israel.         She was a director of Women in Need, a nonprofit organization that seeks to keep homeless women and their children together, and a founder of its summer camp, Camp WIN. She also was a founder of the nonprofit Bronx Community Enterprises, a Montefiore spinoff to encourage local businesses.         She was born Suzanne Storrs Poulton in Provo, Utah, and studied speech and communication at the University of Utah.         She turned to community work 27 years ago, helping to develop methods of improving child care and encouraging self-help among the disadvantaged.         Mrs. Pincus was on the boards of the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, L.I., and the American Place Theater in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband, Lionel I. Pincus, chairman of E. M. Warburg, Pincus & Company, a venture banking firm; two sons, Henry A. and Matthew S., both of Manhattan; and three brothers, Brent Poulton, of Medford, Ore., Kent Poulton, of San Francisco, and Michael Poulton, of Lausanne, Switzerland.       
         Helen Phillips Hayter, an American sculptor, died on Jan. 23 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 81 and also had a home in Paris.         Mrs. Hayter was born in Fresno, Calif., in 1913. After studies at the California School of Fine Arts in San Francisco, she went to Paris on a scholarship in 1936. There she studied engraving at Atelier 17, the printmaking workshop of the painter and engraver Stanley William Hayter. They were married in 1940.         In her sculpture, Mrs. Hayter worked mostly in polished bronze, developing an idiom of semi-abstract figuration influenced by Brancusi, the Surrealists and Pre-Columbian statuary.         During World War II the Hayters lived in New York, where Mr. Hayter published prints by Abstract Expressionists. Mrs. Hayter had her first solo show in 1942 at the New School for Social Research and the first of several joint exhibitions with her husband at the Sidney Janis Gallery in 1949. The Hayters returned to Paris in 1950; they were divorced in 1970.         Mrs. Hayter is represented in several collections, among them the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.         She is survived by two sons, Augy, of Manhattan, and Julian, of Paris; a sister, Marian Britton of Sonoma, Calif., and two grandsons.       
         Ada Lublin Goldberg, for many years an advocate for the poor and homeless on Long Island, died Sunday at Hospice-by-the Sea in Boca Raton, Fla. A resident of North Bellmore, L.I., she was 67.         The cause was renal failure stemming from kidney cancer, said her son, Lawrence A. Goldberg.         Born in Brooklyn, Mrs. Goldberg became active in the League of Women Voters 40 years ago when she joined its Nassau County chapter. At her death, she was the chapter's director of social policy.         In conjunction with her work for the league, she served on the board of the Health and Welfare Council of Nassau County, a coalition of social-welfare agencies and service organizations serving the poor. She received the council's Community Service Award last year.         She also served on the executive board of the Nassau / Suffolk Coalition for a National Health Care Plan. In addition, she was active in the Child Care Council of Nassau County and the Nassau / Suffolk Coalition for the Homeless.         Besides her son, a resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Goldberg is survived by her husband, Stanley; a daughter, Helene of New Haven; two brothers, Howard Lublin of Manhattan and Seldon Lublin of Newburgh, N.Y., and a granddaughter.

         Sidney Robertson Cowell, an ethnomusicologist, writer and the widow of the composer Henry Cowell, died on Thursday at her home in Shady, N.Y., said Sean Hartnett, her executor. She was 92.         In her extensive travels from 1937 to 1957, Mrs. Cowell recorded American, Finnish, Irish, Portuguese, Iranian and Turkish folk music, among other types. Her collection, housed in the Library of Congress, is among the most extensive ever gathered and includes some of the earliest documentation of ethnic music in the United States. It holds not only field recordings, but also correspondence, field notes, photographs, articles and other materials.         She was born in San Francisco in 1903 and received a bachelor of arts in philology and Romance languages from Stanford University in 1924. After graduating, she studied piano in Paris with the pianist and teacher Alfred Cortot.         In 1935-36, she directed the social music program at the Henry Street Settlement in New York City. The next year, she worked for the Resettlement Administration (renamed the Farm Security Administration) in Appalachia and the Ozarks, recording black American music in chain-gang road camps.         She met Cowell in 1927 as his piano student. They were married in 1941 and together they traveled as cultural ambassadors for the State Department, collecting music from around the world. After his death in 1965, she became one of the biggest champions of his music.         Mrs. Cowell was also a teacher and writer. She taught courses in American folk music at the University of Southern California, and was an author, with her husband, of "Charles Ives and His Music" (1955).         No immediate family members survive.       
         Ruth Melville Berlin, a Connecticut philanthropist, died on March 15 at her home in Southport, Conn. She was 74.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Her interests extended to the environment, education, history, the arts and the homeless. She was a past or current officer of the Museums of Stony Brook, the Spoleto Festival U.S.A., the Environmental Defense Fund and the Trust for Public Land of San Francisco, among others.         She also worked for a number of cultural and social welfare groups, including Operation Hope, the New York Philharmonic Society and the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies of New York.         She was born in Brooklyn and attended Smith College.         Her husband, F. Henry Berlin Jr., died in 1976.         Mrs. Berlin is survived by two sons, Bruce B., of Southport, and Carswell R., of Manhattan; a daughter, Margaret M. Berlin of Manhattan; a sister, Margaret M. Blackwell of Setauket, L.I.; two brothers, Frank Melville of Norfolk, Conn., and David Melville of Ringe, N.H., and a granddaughter.       
         Mary Bingham, the matriarch of the Bingham newspaper empire, died suddenly in Louisville, Ky., on Tuesday evening. She was 90 and lived in Glenview, 15 minutes outside Louisville, on the family estate.         Mrs. Bingham, a philanthropist and civic leader and the widow of Barry Bingham Sr., was delivering a speech at a dinner in her honor when she collapsed. She was pronounced dead of cardiac arrest at Norton Hospital.         At the dinner at the Hyatt Regency hotel to raise money for the de Paul School in Louisville, Mrs. Bingham had been toasted by Gov. Brereton Jones; Jon Jory, artistic director of the Actors Theater of Louisville; other Kentucky dignitaries, and her daughter Eleanor Bingham Miller.         Before delivering her prepared speech, Mrs. Bingham said she was so flattered by the event that "the best thing would be for a big pink cloud to come down and take me away." She then spoke about the need for civic responsibility and asked for support of the Louisville Free Public Library.         In the part of her talk that remained undelivered, she quoted Pericles as saying that an Athenian "who did not acquaint himself with and took no part in public affairs was regarded not as unambitious, but as a man of no consequence whatever."         All her life, she was a most enthusiastic participant in public and cultural affairs. Governor Jones said that with Mrs. Bingham's death, "Kentucky has lost one of its most caring and productive citizens."         A distinguished, articulate woman, Mrs. Bingham was for more than 60 years a major presence on the Louisville scene. Mr. and Mrs. Bingham, always known as "the Binghams," were great hosts, especially at Kentucky Derby time, when their invitations were among the most coveted.         Together with Mr. Bingham, who died in 1988, Mrs. Bingham was a generous supporter of the arts and of educational and social programs. She was a strong environmentalist and also led a drive to send book mobiles to rural Kentucky.         After her husband died, she took over as the head of the family foundation, the Mary and Barry Bingham Sr. Fund, which gave $59 million to a wide variety of institutions. Last fall, the Actors Theater of Louisville opened the Bingham Theater. The beneficence of the Binghams is one reason Louisville is such a prosperous cultural community.         In 1986, a bitter family conflict engulfed the Binghams, leading to the sale of their media empire, the cornerstone of which was The Louisville Courier-Journal, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper known for its liberal politics and socially conscious positions. Barry Bingham Sr. had been publisher of the newspaper after his father, Robert Bingham, and, in turn, he had been succeeded by his son Barry Bingham Jr.         After Barry Bingham Jr. and his sisters, Eleanor and Sallie Bingham, were locked in a feud over control of the company, Barry Bingham Sr. decided to sell. The battle and the sale of the paper to the Gannett chain became front-page news throughout the country. Later, several books were written about the conflict and the family itself, including a memoir by Sallie that was critical of her parents.         Behind the scenes, Mrs. Bingham had been a force at the newspaper. She was a vice president and director and wrote editorials while her husband was overseas during World War II. For 26 years, until 1968, she was the editor of the book review section.         Mrs. Bingham was born Mary Caperton on Dec. 24, 1904, in Richmond, and as a young woman, she acted with Richmond's Little Theater. It was while she was a classics major at Radcliffe College that she met her husband, then a student at Harvard University. They were both involved in collegiate dramatics.         After graduating from Radcliffe in 1928, she spent a year studying in Greece on a fellowship. In 1931, she and Barry Bingham were married. They had five children, including two sons, Worth and Jonathan, who died in accidents.         The Binghams were active in Democratic politics and would, as Mrs. Bingham said, "get together with liberal friends on election night to listen to the results in sympathetic company."         When her son became publisher of the paper, he exchanged houses with his parents, as was the family tradition. The parents moved into the so-called Little House on the family estate, an Italianate villa where Mrs. Bingham continued to live after her husband's death.         In addition to her son and daughters, Mrs. Bingham is survived by six grandsons, four granddaughters and a great-granddaughter.       
         Maggie Kuhn, who called herself a little old woman and celebrated her forced retirement in 1970 by founding the Gray Panthers, died yesterday at the home she shared in Philadelphia with a like-minded coterie. She was 89.         "She died peacefully in her sleep," said her personal assistant, Sue Leary, who could not say which of Miss Kuhn's many ailments, from arthritis to osteoporosis, had caused her death.         For all Miss Kuhn's ailments, none had slowed her down. She spent the last 25 years leading people young and old in the fight against age discrimination and other forms of what she saw as social injustice and stereotypical thinking and just two weeks ago she had joined striking transit workers on their picket line.         Even so, there was some evidence that Miss Kuhn knew that the end was coming. Although she had made it her goal to live until her 90th birthday, in August, she had allowed her friends and admirers to celebrate it on April 1. And in a recent issue of the Gray Panthers' publication, The Network, she had lectured the organization's 40,000 members in 32 states on the need to prepare for the 21st century.         It was hardly the first time Miss Kuhn had been ahead of her time.         It was in 1970 that Miss Kuhn, who had worked 25 years for the United Presbyterian Church in New York, commuting daily from her home in Philadelphia, reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 and was forced to leave her job.         "They gave me a sewing machine," she once recalled, "but I never opened it. I was too busy."         Within months of her retirement, she joined several friends in founding an organization quickly dubbed the Gray Panthers, a name derived from the radical Black Panthers.         Despite the name and the initial emphasis on championing the elderly, as conceived by Miss Kuhn the organization knew no age boundaries. Its credo described it simply as an advocate for "fundamental social change that would eliminate injustice, discrimination and oppression in our present society."         For example, in addition to seeking a ban on mandatory retirement, which was eventually enacted into law, the group called for "publicly owned and democratically controlled" utilities.         No one who knew Miss Kuhn was surprised that in last year's health care debate her organization championed what was widely seen as the most radical of the various proposals: health insurance paid totally by the government, a position that had been on the Gray Panthers' official agenda since 1977.         A tiny woman who wore her hair in a prim bun that gave her the look of an ideal candidate to be helped across the street by a Boy Scout, Miss Kuhn, who detested the term "senior citizen," made no apologies for her looks or her age.         "I'm an old woman," she told The New York Times in 1972. "I have gray hair, many wrinkles and arthritis in both hands. And I celebrate my freedom from bureaucratic restraints that once held me."         Miss Kuhn, whose opposition to the war in Vietnam made her a hero to many young protesters, had a disarming argument in recruiting younger people to her cause: "Everyone of us is growing old."         Known as an inspirational speaker, Miss Kuhn was just as persuasive in private conversation, combining honey with the hammer.         "Forceful, yet gracious" is the way Miss Leary put it yesterday.         Miss Kuhn was a champion of social causes long before the Gray Panthers.         As she noted in her 1991 autobiography, "No Stone Unturned," (Ballantine) she was conceived in Memphis, where her father, a traveling district manage for Dunn & Bradstreet, was working at the time. But her mother, refusing to deliver a child into a racist society, insisted on returning to her home in Buffalo to give birth.         As a student at Flora Stone Mather College of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Miss Kuhn helped organize a college chapter of the League of Women Voters.         And in a succession of jobs as a manager of social programs for the Young Women's Christian Association in Cleveland, Philadelphia and Boston and in similar work with the Presbyterian Church in New York, Miss Kuhn took what were then unconventional positions on issues like peace and social justice.         Miss Kuhn, who could also be somewhat unconventional in her private life, attributed the fact that she had never married to "sheer luck."         According to her book, she had many love affairs, including one in her 70's with a student in his 20's. Miss Kuhn did not identify him, but Christina Long, who helped her with the book, said the man, now in his 40's, was at the recent birthday gala. "He seemed very proud of the romance," she said.         Miss Kuhn leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Marion Lounsbury Foster, who was for many years a social services administrator with the Disaster Staff of the American Red Cross, specializing in public and private emergencies, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Bridgeport, Conn.         She was 97 and a longtime resident of New York City.         Beginning in 1917, Mrs. Foster was for 40 years the director of the Home Service Department of the Red Cross's Brooklyn chapter, finding help in times of need for the families of men and women in the armed forces and aid for people in distress after floods, storms, train wrecks and much smaller crises.         In 1931, her office provided Easter dresses to wives of disabled World War I veterans. And in 1938, she directed case workers in aiding victims of a disastrous hurricane that struck Long Island, providing services and financial relief to thousands of families.         Mrs. Foster, who retired in 1957, was also a founder and treasurer of the Brooklyn Association for Mental Health.         She was born in New York City and graduated from the Brearley School, Columbia University and the New York School of Social Work.         Her husband, William Jenkins Foster, died in 1958. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Janet Mathews Fitchen, a cultural anthropologist who studied rural poverty in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 58.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         Dr. Fitchen brought the eye of an anthropologist and her profession's ethnographic methodology to the field of rural sociology. A professor of anthropology, she was the chairwoman of the department of anthropology at Ithaca College.         She wrote "Poverty in Rural America: A Case Study" (Westview, 1981), which surveyed pockets of poverty in the vast stretches of forests and fields of upstate New York. "I call it northern Appalachia," she told a reporter in 1984. "It is poverty that has been entrenched."         Her latest book was "Endangered Spaces, Enduring Places: Change, Identity and Survival in Rural America" (Westview, 1991). It chronicled the demographic, social, cultural, economic and agricultural changes transforming the Northeast. Both books are in print.         More recently, she researched poverty in other regions as an associate of the Western Rural Development Center in Corvallis, Ore. She had accepted a faculty appointment in the department of rural sociology at Cornell University and had planned to leave Ithaca College, where she had been a faculty member since 1977, at the end of the semester.         Dr. Fitchen was born in Manhattan but grew up on her family's dairy farm in Brewster, attending a one-room school. She graduated from Vassar College and received a master's degree in anthropology from the University of Illinois.         She did field work with Oscar Lewis in a Mexican village and received her Ph.D. in anthropology from Cornell.         Dr. Fitchen is survived by her husband, Douglas B. Fitchen, a Cornell professor; a son, John H., of La Jolla, Calif.; and two daughters, Katherine F. Nisbet of Bozeman, Mont., and Sylvia Fitchen of Tucson, Ariz.       
         Marlene Lopez, who was a director of state psychiatric hospitals in New Jersey and New York for 15 years, died on Sunday at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.
