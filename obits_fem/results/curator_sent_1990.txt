During her 20 years as curator, Dr. Szladits scoured England to bargain for diaries and first editions; in this country, she cajoled American authors to think of the Berg first when parting with their papers.
She joined the New York Public Library in 1955 and was appointed curator of the Berg Collection in 1969.
