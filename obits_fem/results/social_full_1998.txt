         Mary Ingraham Bunting-Smith, the Radcliffe president who sought ways to help educated women carve out careers in a society not yet transformed by the feminist movement and became a mentor to several female writers, performers and scholars, died on Wednesday at Kendal at Hanover, a continuing care community in New Hampshire. She was 87.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith, a microbiologist who was Radcliffe president from 1959 to 1972, was called Polly from childhood and added Smith to her name after her second marriage,  in 1979.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith, who was also known for overseeing the fuller integration of Radcliffe College into Harvard, founded the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study -- now the Bunting Institute -- to help women who were scholars, writers, artists and scientists return to careers interrupted by family obligations.         ''Polly Bunting was always ahead of her time in anticipating the needs of women and of Radcliffe College,'' said Derek Bok, president emeritus of Harvard and a professor there. ''The idea of the Radcliffe Institute seems so obvious now. But the idea that there would be women who wanted to come back was a new idea then, and she saw that and created an institution that made it possible.''         Mrs. Bunting-Smith was also the first female member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the President's Committee on the Status of Women and a vice president of the Peace Corps.         Underused women and interrupted careers were a theme for Mrs. Bunting-Smith. She chided society for its ''waste of highly talented, educated womenpower,'' as she put it in a 1961 article she wrote for The New York Times Magazine, calling it a ''prodigious national extravagance.''         A soft-spoken woman who herself had worked part time while her children were young, she devoted her life to fighting that waste, to raising expectations among and about women and to creating opportunities for them.         As she saw it, two ''hidden dissuaders'' lowered the professional expectations of women: a system of higher education that, first, ignored real differences between male and female patterns of life and, second, did not provide for women who wanted to keep working part time in their fields while raising families. She established the Radcliffe Institute specifically to give scholarships to women cut off from careers by marriage.         To see a model of an active, engaged woman, Mrs. Bunting-Smith had only to look within her own family. Born in Brooklyn in 1910, she was one of four children of Mary Shotwell Ingraham, who was president of both the Brooklyn Young Women's Christian Association and the Y.W.C.A.'s national board. Her mother was also  a member of the New York City Board of Higher Education who helped plan the creation of the City University. Her father was Henry A. Ingraham, a lawyer and one of the founders of Long Island College of Medicine.         In her early years, Polly Bunting loved being outside. Although an avid reader, she did not go to school regularly until high school, because of her uncertain health. And she did not enjoy school. ''I was glad to get rid of it in the afternoon and get back to something interesting,'' she once said.         A growing interest in the sciences drew her into academia. She majored in physics at Vassar College, her mother's alma mater. At the University of Wisconsin, she studied agricultural bacteriology, earning a master's degree and a doctorate and meeting her husband, Henry Bunting, a medical student who shared her interest in hiking and bird watching. During his medical residency, she taught at Bennington College in Vermont. They married in 1937 and moved to Connecticut, where he was on the faculty of Yale University and she conducted research, working on the effects of radiation on bacteria.         While her four children were young, she spent more time at home, in Bethany, Conn. But even with young children, Mrs. Bunting-Smith was a 4-H leader, served on the library and school boards and was one of the organizers and directors of the Public Health Nursing Association.         When her husband died of a brain tumor in 1954, however, Mrs. Bunting-Smith was forced to look for a full-time job. Because she was a woman, there were no faculty openings at Yale, her son Charles recalled yesterday, and she jumped at the offer to become dean of Douglass College, the women's college of Rutgers University. She was a professor in the department of bacteriology there and an honorary professor at the Rutgers Institute of Microbiology.         At Douglass, she introduced a multilingual course in world poetry run by the students, as well as a program of part-time study for married women.         Five years later, at age 48, she was offered a job as the fifth president of Radcliffe College, the undergraduate college for women at Harvard University, with about 1,775 women.         She liked talking to students and kept an open door. She taught a freshman seminar. In meetings with students, she would sometimes kick off her shoes and invite her guests to do the same, and to join her on the floor. She also liked to chat with students who dropped by her Brattle Street house, and she would turn on her porch light on to signal that she was in.         Such access did not protect her from student protest. In the late 1960's, 20 black students sat in the Radcliffe administration offices seeking increased minority enrollment. Mrs. Bunting-Smith, who was at a conference in North Carolina, flew back to meet with the protesters and promised to act on their complaints. She faced other protests during the Vietnam War.         Another source of dissension was her work to merge Radcliffe more completely into Harvard. Radcliffe students already took classes with Harvard students, but they were admitted to college separately and had their own living quarters, administration and trustees. Mrs. Bunting-Smith thought the system inequitable and worked to integrate the campuses more fully, even though it ultimately reduced the role of the Radcliffe president.         But she may be best remembered for the establishment of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, which opened in 1961 with the help of $150,000 from the Carnegie Foundation and other grants. Its purpose was to pursue research into the psychological and cultural factors that affected women's status in society, and also to support female artists, scientists and scholars, particularly those who had suspended their careers because of family responsibilities.         In its first year the institute gave 20 women scholarships of up to $3,000 each, space to do their work and access to Radcliffe and Harvard services.         The poet Maxine Kumin, a member of that first group of scholars, remembers her two years at the institute as an ''amazing'' experience, with a diverse group of artists, scientists, social scientists and poets, ''with Polly Bunting as our ringmaster.''         Ms. Kumin said that at a time when she was teaching English composition to physical education majors at Tufts University because only men were allowed to teach liberal arts majors, ''being chosen as a Radcliffe scholar put an imprimatur on what you were doing and gave it legitimacy.''         Since that first class of scholars, more than 1,200 women have been given fellowships at the institute, including the author Alice Walker, the psychologist Carol Gilligan; former Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont; the poets Anne Sexton and Sophie Cabot Black; the performance artist Anna Deavere Smith; the anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, and the geophysicist and astronaut Marcia McNutt.         After Mrs. Bunting-Smith stepped down as president of Radcliffe in 1972, she spent three years as special assistant to the president of Princeton University, William Bowen, working on coeducation there.         In 1979, she married Dr. Clement A. Smith, a pediatrician and faculty member at Harvard. He died in 1988.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith is survived by three sons, Charles I. Bunting of Shelbourne, Vt., William H. Bunting of North Whitefield, Me., and John E. Bunting of New Boston, N.H.; a daughter, Mary B. Decher of Bellevue, Wash; three stepdaughters,  Pamela Smith of Harvard, Me., Gail Smith Biggar of Concord, Mass., and Hilary Smith of Peacham, Vt.; a stepson, Reynolds Smith of Harvard, Me.; a sister, Winifred I. Warner of Laurel Hollow, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Hart Hirshon, a glamorous figure in New York society from the 1920's through the 40's who later became active in social, human rights and political causes, died Thursday in an automobile accident while driving near her home in Glen Cove, on Long Island. She was 89.         Frequently photographed and written about during her glittering earlier marriages to John Randolph Hearst and William S. Paley, she married Walter Hirshon, a stockbroker, in 1953. After their divorce in 1961, she became increasingly involved in education and philanthropic endeavors.         Described as ''one of the most beautiful girls in Southern California'' by Irene Selznick, Dorothy Hart was 19 when she met her first husband, Mr. Hearst, the third of William Randolph Hearst's five sons, while sailing on a yacht off Santa Barbara.         Mr. Hearst had not yet entered his first year at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, but the couple were married in New York in December 1927.         The groom dropped out of college after his freshman year and joined the Hearst Corporation, and the young marrieds became regulars in the glamorous cafe society of the period, out on the town almost every night.         Mr. Hearst, who had difficulty working with his powerful father, began drinking heavily. Mrs. Hearst, hoping to set an example for her husband, who rarely showed up for work, took a job writing a column for Harper's Bazaar.         Mrs. Hearst met Mr. Paley, the dashing head of the Columbia Broadcasting System, in 1931. According to friends, it was immediately obvious that he was determined to marry her.         After some months, she went to Nevada and filed for a divorce. Mr. Hearst followed her; the couple reconciled and returned to New York. Five months later, Mrs. Hearst again traveled to Las Vegas and was granted a divorce. In May 1932, she married Mr. Paley in Kingman, Ariz.         ''Although seven years his junior, Dorothy was more worldly than he,'' Sally Bedell Smith wrote in ''In All His Glory,'' her 1990 biography of Mr. Paley. ''She knew her way around in sophisticated circles; friendships with men like Randolph Churchill counted a great deal to the ambitious Paley. In New York, she joined the Algonquin set -- the playwrights, journalists and other intellectuals whose luncheon ripostes during the 1920's became a literary legend.''         Over the years, Mrs. Smith wrote, Mr. Paley's wife had an impact on him -- ''her political leanings, appetite for news, taste in art and sense of style. She supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and embraced his proposals for social welfare.''         David Patrick Columbia wrote in Quest magazine in 1993: ''They were the golden couple on the town. She became his Pygmalion. His hunger to know satisfied her trenchant desire to teach. He had the instincts, but she, despite her youth, had the instincts and the knowledge. She began transforming his life. She got him to Savile Row tailors. She encouraged him to buy art and introduced him to dealers. In a short time they began to accumulate what is now known as the William Paley Collection. At her suggestion, they pursued the thoroughly modern path of psychoanalysis.''         She was sketched by Matisse, photographed by Cecil Beaton and Horst, listed as one of the world's best-dressed women and featured in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. She decorated Kiluna Farm, their 85-acre estate in Manhasset, with a saltwater pool and an indoor tennis court, lining the walls with their growing collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. Twenty-two servants looked after the house, gardens and greenhouse.         The Paleys separated in 1945, shortly after Mr. Paley returned from wartime service in London. Mrs. Smith observed in her book that Mr. Paley's ''peccadillos weren't the only symptom of trouble ahead.''         ''To those with a sharp eye, other hairline cracks were showing in the marriage,'' Mrs. Smith wrote. ''When Dorothy corrected him in public, she was brisk and impatient, not gentle.''         They were divorced in 1947, and she received some paintings, furniture, silver and $1.5 million.         ''I never behaved as if the world revolved around him,'' Mrs. Hirshon once recalled about her marriage to Mr. Paley. ''Maybe that was a problem.''         Dorothy Hart was born in Los Angeles on Feb. 25, 1908, the only child of Seth Hart, an insurance broker, and the former Dorothy Jones. While she was in elementary school, the family moved to Dayton, Ohio, for three years. Upon their return to Los Angeles, she attended Marlboro, an exclusive girls' school. She later spent a year at Bennett Junior College in Millbrook, N.Y., and furthered her lifelong interest in art by taking several art history courses.         Although she participated in a number of social projects throughout her life, raising money to build a nursery school in Harlem, for instance, and serving as a guidance counselor at the Downtown Community School in the 1940's, she became more involved in philanthropic and community activities in the last 40 years.         She worked with the Neighborhood Children's Center for more than two decades, was a member of the New York City Human Rights Commission, served on the Hospitality Committee of the United Nations in the 1960's, and became a board member of the Vivian Beaumont Theater, a board member of Lincoln Center in the 1980's and a trustee of Carnegie Hall. She was also on the board of Phoenix House and was a trustee of the New School for Social Research until her death.         She is survived by a son, Jeffrey Paley of Manhattan; a daughter, Hilary Paley Califano of Roxbury, Conn., and Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Joy H. Briggs of Manhattan, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Mae Questel, a rubber-voiced veteran of stage, screen and vaudeville who played Woody Allen's mother in ''New York Stories'' and was the cartoon voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Ms. Questel was 17 and living in the South Bronx when she won a local contest to find the girl who most resembled Helen Kane, a popular singer known as the boop-oop-a-doop queen. Ms. Questel was signed by an agent that night and soon was performing on the vaudeville circuit, including numerous stints at the Palace Theater.         She appeared in acts alongside many other performers and also as a ''single,'' using her flexible vocal cords to sing and do imitations of Maurice Chevalier, Fanny Brice, Rudy Vallee and Marlene Dietrich.         When the animator Max Fleischer heard Ms. Questel doing her boop-oop-a-doop routine in 1931, he signed her to take over the cartoon voice of Betty Boop in more than 150 animated shorts, until Fleischer retired the character in 1939. Her recording of ''On the Good Ship Lollipop,'' in Betty Boop's voice, sold more than two million copies in the 1930's.         In 1933, she created the voices of Olive Oyl and Sweet Pea for the ''Popeye'' cartoons, and played Popeye's scrawny paramour in more than 450 cartoons until they went out of production in 1967. She once told an interviewer that her Olive Oyl voice was an attempt to imitate the actress ZaSu Pitts. At various times, she also provided the voices for Little Audrey, Casper the Friendly Ghost and other cartoon characters.         Among her many Broadway credits were ''Dr. Social'' in 1948, ''A Majority of One'' in 1959 and ''Enter Laughing'' in 1963. She also appeared in the film version of ''A Majority of One'' in 1962, ''Funny Girl'' in 1968 and ''New York Stories'' in 1989. On the soundtrack of Mr. Allen's ''Zelig'' (1983) she sang the Betty Boop theme song, ''Chameleon Days.''         She is survived by a son, Richard Balkin of upstate New York, and three granddaughters.         In 1963 Ms. Questel was asked to give her philosophy for survival. ''Don't make a megillah out of every little thing,'' she said.         Correction:  January 16, 1998, Friday  A picture caption on Jan. 8 with an obituary of the actress who was the cartoon voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl misspelled her surname. She was Mae Questel, as the article  said, not Questal.       
         Alice Hanson Cook, a Cornell University scholar, early feminist and longtime advocate of equal pay for women and support programs for working mothers, died on Feb. 7 at her home in Ithaca, N.Y., of complications from a stroke. She was 94.         Professor Cook began work at Cornell in 1954 and was associated with the university for almost two decades, specializing in labor history in the School of Industrial and Labor Relations. She wrote extensively on issues dealing with women, unions, labor relations, sex discrimination and equal employment opportunities in the United States and abroad.         ''She was not only interested, but concerned in every aspect of the working woman's life,'' said Jennie Farley, a Cornell professor of industrial and labor relations. ''Alice  made it clear that these issues were universal in their importance and that they affected every woman no matter where she lived and worked.''         Her retirement in 1972 was marked with the establishment of Cook's Grove in a Cornell quadrangle, identified by a plaque that read ''Teacher, Feminist, First University Ombudsman.''         Speaking at a 1993 showing of ''Never Done: The Working Life of Alice H. Cook,'' a documentary film on her career, Professor Cook described her mother and grandmother as turn-of-the-century suffragists who had brought her up to believe that ''girls deserved education as much as boys.'' At the same event, she recalled the opening of the Cornell Faculty Club to women -- an event in which she played a pivotal role -- and her appointment as the university's first ombudsman.         The daughter of Flora and August Hanson, a peripatetic railroad accountant, Alice Hanson was born in Alexandria, Va., in 1903. She attended  Northwestern University, her mother's alma mater, where she was a co-founder of the student Liberal League to promote socialism, civil liberties and labor unions, and was involved in the Student League for Industrial Democracy.         She recalled that she and 37 fellow students had once identified themselves as pacifists who would refuse to fight in another war. They were branded ''the 38'' by The Chicago Tribune, she said, and described as ''a regretted presence at Northwestern.''         As she became increasingly active, she shared speakers' platforms with Jane Addams, the founder of Hull House in Chicago; worked in St. Louis with a social welfare agency, and taught at a cooperative farming community in Arkansas. After receiving her degree in 1924, she married Wesley Cook, a divinity student who later became involved in union activities. They were divorced in 1950.         Professor Cook's career spanned five spheres: social work, labor organization, labor education, foreign service and the academy. In the late 1930's, she left her job with the Y.W.C.A. in Philadelphia to organize textile workers. Later, she was associated in community affairs and education with the Brotherhood of Locomotive Enginemen and Firemen, the Amalgamated Meat Cutters and Butcher Workmen, and the Marine and Shipbuilding Workers.         She was the visiting expert on labor education with the Office of Military Government in postwar Germany in the late 1940's, and chief of the Adult Education Section of the United States High Commission in Germany from 1950 to 1952.         She joined the extension division of the New York State School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell in 1952 and two years later was invited by the dean to teach labor history.         Her autobiography, ''A Lifetime in Labor,'' completed shortly before her death, will be published this spring by Feminist Press of New York.         She is survived by two sons, Phillip Cook of Buffalo and Thomas Bernstein of Manhattan; two brothers, Frederick Hanson of Sun Lakes, Ariz., and Evanston, Ill., and Theodore Hanson of Honolulu; three grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.       
         Alice Marie Miel, an educator who was among the earliest to advance the notion that curriculum in the nation's classrooms should have a role in preparing children for the society they will enter as adults, died on Jan. 31 at the North Florida Regional Medical Center in Gainesville. She was 91.         Dr. Miel, a former resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, moved to Gainesville after retiring from Teachers College at Columbia University in 1971.         As a professor of education and an author who specialized in curriculum development, Dr. Miel (pronounced mile) taught and left her imprint on the subject throughout the country and around the world.         She taught and wrote that a good teacher was a student with the world as the classroom. She set forth that approach in more than 10 books and other writings, beginning with the 1946 classic, ''Changing the Curriculum: A Social Process'' (Appleton). It counseled ''group solidarity and heterogeneity'' in curriculum development or, as she put it, ''diversity within unity.''         She believed that teachers must inspire their students to creativity and awareness of society at large even as they teach the basics. Her concern was that too many American children were growing up without a clue to their country's social and racial diversity. It was a conclusion that most of her peers had yet to reach.         She promoted the concept that education should be a vehicle toward a world community and intercultural understanding, beginning at home. In the book ''More Than Social Studies'' (Prentice-Hall, 1957) she coined the term ''social educator,'' whose classroom becomes ''a particular setting in which children can experience democratic living.''         She had particular trouble with the way children were being reared in the white suburbs of the 1960's, which she wrote about in a four-year study published in 1967, ''The Shortchanged Children of Suburbia.'' She concluded that these children were  being deprived of the ''rich diversity of American life,'' never knowing an African-American or poor youngster their own age.         Born on Feb. 21, 1906, in Six Lakes, Mich., she graduated in 1928 from the University of Michigan, where she earned a master's three years later. She received her doctorate in education at Teachers College in 1944.         Her career started in Ann Arbor, Mich. She taught elementary and secondary school and became a principal. Before she arrived at Teachers College, she was the curriculum coordinator for the public schools of Mount Pleasant, Mich.         In 1945, she was appointed a professor at Teachers College and staff researcher at the Horace Mann-Lincoln Institute of School Experimentation. In 1960, she took charge of the college's department of curriculum and teaching, which deals with education programs from the nursery to the college level.         Four years before she took emeritus status, Teachers College established Project Milestone for a ''re-look, revitalization and a recommitment to the central themes'' of Dr. Miel's thinking.         Dr. Miel is survived by two brothers, Homer Miel of Stanton, Mich., and Lucas S. Miel of Destin, Mich.       
         Martha Ellis Gellhorn, who as one of the first female war correspondents covered a dozen major conflicts in a writing career spanning more than six decades, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 89.         Ms. Gellhorn was a cocky, raspy-voiced maverick who saw herself as a champion of ordinary people trapped in conflicts created by the rich and powerful. That she was  known to many largely because of  her marriage to Ernest Hemingway, from 1940 to 1945, caused her unending irritation, especially when critics tried to find parallels between her lean writing style and that of her more celebrated husband.         ''Why should I be a footnote to somebody else's life?'' she bitterly asked in an interview, pointing out that she had written two novels before meeting Hemingway and continued writing for almost a half-century after leaving him.         As a journalist, Ms. Gellhorn had no use for the notion of objectivity. The chief point of going to cover anything, she felt, was so you could tell what you saw, contradict the lies and let the bad guys have it.         ''You go into a hospital, and it's full of wounded kids,'' she once said. ''So you write what you see and how it is. You don't say there's 37 wounded children in this hospital, but maybe there's 38 wounded children on the other side. You write what you see.''         Though best known for her groundbreaking journalism, Ms. Gellhorn was also an accomplished fiction writer, author of 5 novels, 14 novellas and 2 collections of short stories, many of which were based on people and incidents she encountered during her prodigious travels.         Fresh out of Bryn Mawr College in 1927, she began writing for The New Republic, then became a crime reporter for a local newspaper in Albany. Ms. Gellhorn got to Europe by writing a brochure for the Holland American Line and traveled throughout the continent. Later, she met Harry Hopkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's confidant, and talked her way into a job with the New Deal, wandering America and writing about the effects of the Depression on ordinary people.         She went to Spain in 1937 with nothing but a knapsack and $50, covered the conflict for Collier's Weekly and became Hemingway's lover.         ''In Barcelona, it was perfect bombing weather,'' she wrote in a typical dispatch in 1938. ''The cafes along the Ramblas were crowded. There was nothing much to drink; a sweet fizzy poison called orangeade and a horrible liquid supposed to be sherry. There was, of course, nothing to eat. Everyone was out enjoying the cold afternoon sunlight. No bombers had come over for at least two hours.''         She covered the blitz in London. On D-Day, she stowed away on a hospital ship and snuck ashore as a stretcher bearer. She got British pilots to let her ride along on night bombing raids over Germany. When the Allies liberated Dachau, she was there to write about it.         ''Behind the barbed wire and the electric fence,'' she wrote of her visit to Dachau, ''the skeletons sat in the sun and searched themselves for lice. They have no age and no faces; they all look alike and like nothing you will ever see if you are lucky.''         She covered Russia's war against Finland in 1939, trekked across China with Hemingway in 1940, and became increasingly critical of the United States, which she saw as a ''colonial power,'' eventually settling abroad for good. She covered Vietnam, Nicaraguan contras, the Arab-Israeli conflict and, at the age of 81, the United States invasion of Panama. It was only when war came to Bosnia that she gave it a pass.         ''Too old,'' she said. ''You have to be nimble for war.''         Ms. Gellhorn's war correspondence was collected in ''The Face of War'' in 1959. She always focused on ordinary foot soldiers and civilians, ignoring the generals. Her peacetime journalism was collected in ''The View From the Ground'' in 1988.         Among her novels were ''A Stricken Field'' (1940), set among refugees in Prague just before the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, and ''Liana'' (1944), about the marriage of a mulatto woman and a rich white man in the French Caribbean.         Many reviewers felt Ms. Gellhorn was even more successful as a writer of novellas, and she was highly praised for ''The Weather in Africa'' (1988), three novellas set on that continent, and ''The Novellas of Martha Gellhorn'' (1993).         Ms. Gellhorn sometimes took criticism from political conservatives, who painted her as a left-leaning dilettante whose writing was often didactic and sentimental. Others  criticized her vivid journalism as being, stylistically, too much like fiction and her terse fiction as being, stylistically, too much like journalism.         But her longevity and the compelling pull of her life story overrode such criticisms. A heroine to generations of young women correspondents for her fight to get equal treatment and a place on the front lines with male colleagues, she was also a romantic figure for her wartime relationship with one of the century's most famous writers and her subsequent rejection of him.         Ms. Gellhorn's father was a doctor in St. Louis with progressive notions and her mother, whom she adored, was a suffragist and social reformer who sometimes took her daughter  with her to rallies and protests.         Her father pulled her out of a convent school when he discovered the nuns were teaching female anatomy with a textbook that had its pictures covered and transferred the girl to a progressive coeducational school of which her mother was a co-founder.  Later, at Bryn Mawr, Ms. Gellhorn changed her major from English to French, which became useful for her  journalistic work in Europe. In 1934, she was among a group of American students invited to tour Nazi Germany, and she never forgot her first encounter with Fascism. When she returned to the United States and was working for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, she befriended Eleanor Roosevelt and spent some time, as the First Lady's guest, at the White House. She also wrote a collection of novellas about it, ''The Trouble I've Seen'' (1936).         Her first marriage, in 1933 to Bertrand de Jouvenel, a French pacifist who was the son-in-law of the novelist Colette, ended in divorce.         In 1936, she wandered into a bar in Key West, Fla., and met Hemingway. They drank, became friends and, the next year, when she showed up in Madrid, she picked up again with Hemingway and other war correspondents. She married the author in 1940, becoming his third wife.         They traveled and worked together, living between conflicts at a villa in Cuba. In 1945, Ms. Gellhorn left Hemingway, walking out after an argument at London's Dorchester Hotel. She was the only one of Hemingway's wives to leave him, and he never forgave her. ''His hatred of her was a terrible thing to see,'' one Hemingway biographer noted. She left, she said, because he was jealous and bullying.         Ms. Gellhorn's third marriage, to T. S. Matthews, an editor at Time magazine, also ended in divorce. She said she just found married life too boring.         After World War II, Ms. Gellhorn adopted a son in Italy and raised him, largely on her own, in Mexico and other countries, where she supported herself with a string of articles for women's magazines.         She is survived by her son, George Alexander Gellhorn of London, and a brother, Alfred Gellhorn of New York.         Ms. Gellhorn had decided that she could no longer live in the United States, and moved from Cuba to Italy to Mexico to Kenya until finally settling in Britain, where she spent her  last 15 years shuttling between a small cottage in Wales, an apartment in London and the world's trouble spots. Her South Kensington apartment became a kind of salon for writers and foreign correspondents.         Bill Buford, the fiction editor at The New Yorker who was previously the editor of Granta, an English literary magazine, wrote about Ms. Gellhorn and her work: ''Reading Martha Gellhorn for the first time is a staggering experience. She is not a travel writer or a journalist or a novelist. She is all of these, and one of the most eloquent witnesses of the 20th century.''         She also wrote a highly regarded travel book in 1979, ''Travels With Myself and Another,'' that was an often humorous recounting of some of her more uncomfortable jaunts to remote corners of the globe, some  with Hemingway, whom she referred to only as Unwilling Companion.         Her first love continued to be a crusading brand of nonfiction. ''Journalism is education for me,'' she wrote. ''Writing is payment for the chance to look and learn.''         She wrote on an old, battered typewriter and had to quit in 1992 when a cataract operation left her with diminished eyesight. She could no longer see the keys and felt she was too old to learn how to dictate.         But she never lost her bite. She chain-smoked, drank and ate what she pleased. ''It bores me, all that health stuff,'' she said. She told one woman who came to interview her late in life that she had to stop. ''This conversation is so boring I think I'm going to faint,'' she said.         Ms. Gellhorn had little use for most war reporting after the Vietnam War, saying that the press' role in ending that conflict had taught military leaders a lesson.         ''They realized the power of the press and have been controlling it ever since,'' she said. ''Look at the Gulf War. If you wanted to go out and say to a soldier, 'How is it, kid?,' you had to bring a minder so the kid says nothing.         ''It seems to me that they feed war reporters at these ridiculous briefings in the ballroom of hotels miles from anywhere.'' The public, she said, needs to realize that it is not getting the full story.         Looking back on a life that was colorful enough for any novel or reportage, Ms. Gellhorn once confessed: ''I'm overprivileged. I've had a wonderful life. I didn't deserve it but I've had it.''       
         Chessy Rayner, a decorator, fashion icon, editor and author of ''New York: Trends and Traditions,'' a recently published book about significant Manhattan interiors, died on Thursday night at Sloan-Kettering Medical Center in New York. She was 66.         Mica Ertegun, her partner in the design company MAC II, said that Mrs. Rayner died of lung cancer.         Rail-thin, exotically featured and crowned with a lion's mane of hair that gave her the look of a space-age Nefertiti, Chesbrough (Chessy) Lewis Hall was born in 1931 in Perrysburg, Ohio, into a privileged world where little was expected of a young woman except a fairy tale debut, a comfortable marriage and an entry in the Social Register.         The only child of Richard Hall and Chesbrough Lewis, a cafe society beauty famously photographed by Horst and Avedon, she dutifully followed her social destiny: finishing school, Briarcliff Junior College and candle-lighted wedding at St. Thomas Protestant Episcopal Church in Manhattan, in 1952, to William P. Rayner, a stockbroker who later became an executive at Conde Nast Publications.         The Rayners were celebrated in Vogue as ''a fast-paced, superattractive couple,'' and rare was the week when her haunting face and couture-clad frame did not appear in Women's Wear Daily.         Her star quotient increased exponentially in 1963, after her mother remarried, becoming the wife of Iva S. V. Patcevitch, the chairman of Conde Nast. For the rest of her life, she was one of the best-dressed and most-photographed fixtures of the Manhattan social scene.         But rather than idling indefinitely in the social spotlight, Mrs. Rayner  went to work for Ladies Home Journal, moved to Glamour, and then became a fashion editor at Vogue from 1956 to 1964.         By the mid-1960's, William Rayner said, ''The bubble was off the champagne.'' Bored with the business of fashion and chafing under her dictatorial boss, Diana Vreeland, Mrs. Rayner left Vogue and went in search of what William Rayner  called ''less ephemeral, more creative'' work. The couple were divorced in 1989.         She is survived by her mother, Chesbrough Patcevitch; a half-brother, Charles Minot Amory 3d, and a nephew, Charles Minot Amory 4th, all of Palm Beach, Fla.         She and Mica Ertegun, the wife of Ahmet Ertegun, the president of Atlantic Records, toyed with opening a restaurant. Though accomplished cooks -- Mrs. Rayner wrote three cookbooks -- friends decided that their individual talents, Mrs. Rayner's sense of color and Mrs. Ertegun's architectural eye, would offer more long-term opportunities.  MAC II -- the initials stood for Mica and Chessy -- was founded in 1967. For several years, its office was a large closet in the Erteguns' house on the Upper East Side.         Though House and Garden hailed the company for its ''consistently clean and crisp adaptations of shifting modes,'' initially, fellow designers looked upon the two young stylish women with disdain. Sister Parish, the white-gloved martinet of American decorating, dismissed them with chilling politesse: ''Chessy is a nice girl. And Mica does not have to work.'' Everybody else called them ''the girls.'' As Mrs. Rayner wryly told Vogue soon after MAC II opened, ''You can see how much dignity we command.''         Their first published project was a bedroom for the 9-year-old daughter of a friend, with tall bookcases made of bamboo poles and topped with burnt-orange felt valances. Soon, however, they became a force to be reckoned with, and by the early 1980's had amassed a portfolio of residential and commercial projects for boldface celebrities like the artist Kenneth Noland, the television producer Douglas Cramer and the fashion designer Bill Blass. Marian McEvoy, the editor of Elle Decor magazine, said that what distinguished their projects was ''pragmatic glamour.''         ''Chessy was a decorator, not a re-decorator,'' said Arnold Scaasi, the fashion designer. ''One of the reasons that I chose her was because she told me I could keep all of my old furniture.''         MAC II's spare, uncluttered rooms are known for luxurious but simple finishes, comfortable seating and art that is part of the space, not a dominant element. In one New York living room, moody paintings by Manet and Van Dongen seemed to be emerging from the surface of the gold lacquered walls as from the bottom of a pond.         But despite her professional eminence, Mrs. Rayner, who enjoyed discovering beauty in unlikely places and at underwhelming prices, did not shy from projects that her equally celebrated competition might consider beneath their dignity.         To furnish a landmark house designed by the architect Stanford White, she and Mrs. Ertegun cheerfully bought everything at Sears. For another project, it was all department-store furniture and Herculon fabrics.         In the pages of Elle Decor, where she was the special projects editor from 1992 until her death, Mrs. Rayner was forever exhorting readers to delight more in $2 water glasses than in $2 million chandeliers. Her home on St. Martin, the Caribbean island, will be featured in the May issue of Elle Decor.         ''Not everything has to be refined,'' she once said to a reporter who visited her country house in Southampton. ''That's too easy and too boring. I like amusing things, funny things, offbeat things. In fact, if anything, I wish my taste were even more offbeat.''       
         Irene Kampen, who saw her sometimes strife-torn life as such a sitcom that it took Lucille Ball to portray it on television, died on Monday in Oceanside, Calif. She was 75 and the author of the book that inspired ''The Lucy Show.''         Her family said the cause was breast cancer.         Mrs. Kampen may not have been a born humorist, but she got a good start. Her father, Jack Trepel, a Rockefeller Center florist, was an accomplished magician with the gift of patter, and to hear Mrs. Kampen tell it, her mother, Mary, always had something funny to say and never held her tongue.         By the time she got to the University of Wisconsin, Mrs. Kampen, who was born in Brooklyn and later lived in Great Neck, N.Y., was funny enough to become editor of the campus humor magazine.         After graduating in 1943 with a degree in journalism, she worked as a copy girl at the old New York Journal-American. A child of her era, she wanted to be a conventional housewife and mother, and for a while she got her wish.         After her marriage to Owen Kampen, an artist and illustrator whom she had met in college, the couple settled in Levittown, on Long Island, where Mrs. Kampen kept house, took care of her young daughter, and, in a concession to her training, contributed society columns to the weekly Levittown Tribune.         In 1954, to be closer to Mrs. Kampen's parents, the couple built a house in Ridgefield, Conn., and might have settled into an idyllic New England life if Mr. Kampen hadn't had an affair with the architect's wife.  The resulting divorce was as bitter as any, but Mrs. Kampen came through it with a sure-fire sense of the absurd.         It wasn't easy being a divorced mother in a tiny New England town in the 1950's. Mrs. Kampen took in another struggling divorced mother to help make ends meet.         But for all the economic hardship and social stigma, she not only made the best of it; she also took notes.  And when she turned them into a book, ''Life Without George,'' in 1961, she had a new career.         Her timing was close to perfect. The book came out just as Lucille Ball, whose divorce from Desi Arnaz had undercut the premise of her famous ''I Love Lucy'' television series, was casting around for a new format as a working mother. ''Life Without George'' fit the bill.         The success of the book and of the television series, which ran from 1962 to 1968, helped persuade Mrs. Kampen to continue mining her life for comedy. Although she had barely mentioned her husband in ''Life Without George,'' she tried her hand at serious, cathartic fiction with ''We That Are Left,'' a thinly disguised 1961 account of her marriage.         For the 1965 ''Europe Without George,'' she returned to humor with a vengeance.         Taking no chances during a summer research vacation, she ordered her college-age daughter to go out and have fun and adventures in every city they visited.         Her daughter chafed a bit, but provided enough good subject matter that for a while she became a virtual subsidiary of the family enterprise. When she and her boyfriend wanted to go skiing, for example, her mother insisted on going along, not simply as a chaperone but because she wanted to take notes. Mrs. Kampen recounted the adventure in ''Last Year at Sugarbush'' (1965).         Similarly, her daughter's wedding became ''Here Comes the Bride, There Goes the Mother'' (1967), and while Mrs. Kampen did not accompany the couple on their honeymoon, she was right there when they went to graduate school at the University of Wisconsin, turning out ''Due to Lack of Interest, Tomorrow Has Been Canceled,'' the story of a 45-year-old divorced woman who returns to college in the hippie era.         Mrs. Kampen, whose other books include ''Are You Carrying Any Gold or Living Relatives?,'' a 1970 account of a trip to the Soviet Union, also wrote widely for magazines, turned out self-deprecating columns about her life for local newspapers and talked her way repeatedly around the world as a cruise-ship lecturer.         As she got older, the travails of aging provided a fount of material.         In addition to her daughter, Christine Gutherie of San Francisco, Mrs. Kampen is survived by her companion, Louis Ferioli, and a sister, Joyce Miller of Washington.       
         Lily Harmon, an artist who worked in portraiture, assemblage and book illustration, and whose third husband was the collector Joseph H. Hirshhorn, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Ms. Harmon, whose original name  was Lily Perlmutter, was born in 1912 in New Haven. She studied art at the Yale School of Fine Arts in New Haven, then at the Academie Colarossi in Paris and the Art Students' League in New York. By the early 1930's she was working in a Social Realist style that with adjustments would be the mainstay of her work.         Ms. Harmon's art could lean toward social satire similar to Philip Evergood's, or scenes of poetic introspection, like some of Philip Guston's early works. But it usually followed a tradition of sympathetic portraiture personified by Raphael Soyer, becoming increasingly refined in the 1970's. Her subjects tended to be relatives or art-world friends: her grandmother; the painter Helen Frankenthaler; Mimi Gross, the daughter of the sculptor Chaim Gross; and the mother of her first husband, Philip Graham Harden, shown in a work from 1931 titled ''My Nude Mother-in-Law.''         Ms. Harmon had her first solo exhibition at the Associated American Artists Gallery in New York in 1944. She met the millionaire Joseph Hirshhorn, one of the most active art collectors of his generation, in the early 40's when he visited her studio to see her paintings. They were married in 1945 and adopted two infant daughters, in 1946 and 1950. The marriage ended in divorce in 1956.         Ms. Harmon exhibited regularly in surveys of contemporary American art in museums across the country, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh.         In 1982, a 50-year retrospective organized by the Wichita Art Museum in Kansas traveled to the Provincetown Art Association in Massachusetts and the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio. In December, the Butler Institute mounted a second show, devoted to the found-object assemblages and collages that Ms. Harmon made intermittently in the 1960's and 70's, which will close on March 1.         Ms. Harmon is represented in public collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum and the Jewish Museum in New York City, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.         From 1945 to 1976, Ms. Harmon illustrated books, most notably works by Andre Gide, Jean-Paul Sartre, Thomas Mann, Edith Wharton and Franz Kafka. ''Freehand,'' her autobiography, was published in 1981 (Simon & Schuster).         Ms. Harmon was married three other times. From 1934 to 1940, she was married to Sidney Harmon, a film and theatrical producer. In 1960 she was married briefly to Henry Rothman, a framemaker. In 1972 she married Milton Schachter, a real estate developer, who died in 1996.         She is survived by her daughters, Amy Hirshhorn, of Watertown, Mass., and Jo Ann Hirshhorn, of New Orleans, and two grandchildren.       
         Countess Anthony Szapary, the doyenne of Newport society and the great-great-granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt who lived a good part of the year on the upper floors of  the Breakers, maintaining the family's presence in the 70-room mansion built by her grandparents, died on Sunday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 79.         The Countess had suffered a stroke at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y., her family said.         The former Sylvia Anita Gabriel Denise Irene Marie Szechenyi (pronounced sa-CHAIN-ee) was one of five daughters of Count Lazlo Szechenyi and Gladys Moore Vanderbilt Szechenyi. Her father was the first minister from Hungary to the United States and later served at the Court of St. James. Her mother was the daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt 2d, who built the Breakers as the family's summer home.         The house, designed by Richard Morris Hunt and covering more than an acre of the 11-acre estate, was modeled after Renaissance palaces in Turin and Genoa, and was finished in 1895. The mansion, which, with furnishings costing $7 million, was one of the Gilded Age estates referred to by their owners at the time as cottages.         The Breakers was maintained as a private residence until 1947 when it was leased to the Preservation Society of Newport County for $1 a year. The maintenance and the taxes were paid by Countess Szechenyi until her death in 1965. The society bought the property in 1972, but Countess Szapary (pronounced sa-PAR-ee) continued to live in rooms on the third floor, and her devotion to the Breakers endured to the end of her life, officials of the society said yesterday. The original furnishings were not included in the sale of the property, but over the years Countess Szechenyi's descendants gave most of them to the society.         Countess Szapary, who was known as Syvie to her friends, was a lively woman with strong opinions, an impish sense of humor and an adventurous spirit. As a child, she used a large silver tray to toboggan down the impressive staircase at the Breakers, a tradition that younger members of the Vanderbilt family are said to have carried on. She also rode her bicycle at breakneck speed around the great hall, and during World War II, when the house was shuttered, she maintained, tongue in cheek, that she kept America safe through her volunteer work as a plane spotter on the roof of a boys school in Newport.         In her later years, after the Breakers was opened to tourists (who were always called guests, at her insistence), she would occasionally join the tour group, casually dressed, her identity unknown, and correct the guides if she believed they had made a mistake.         Born in Remete, in Austria-Hungary, on Oct. 9, 1918, the Countess attended the Potomac School in Washington, Miss Faunce's School in London and the Chateau Brilliantmont in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1949, she married Count Anthony Szapary, a founder of the Hungarian National Sports Federation. Earlier, during World War II, he had been sent to a concentration camp for activities with the Hungarian Red Cross and his relief work for Polish and Jewish refugees. He was released through the intervention of King Gustav V of Sweden and came to the United States in 1947, becoming an adviser to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. He died in 1972.         The Countess is survived by a son, Paul, and a daughter, Gladys Szapary, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Countess Ferdinandine Eltz of Salzburg, Austria.         Countess Szapary was a former president of the Rhode Island Arts Foundation at Newport and was actively involved in the Newport Preservation Society. She was an organizer of the Newport Coaching weekends and aided several charities. She enjoyed both giving and going to parties and, as an avid amateur photographer, almost always had a small camera slung around her neck at the many social occasions in which she took part. She was known among her friends for the small albums of photographs that she often sent to other celebrators.         Countess Szapary was chairwoman of the 1995 centennial celebration of the Breakers, for which she created, in the stables of the estate, ''New York Central With the Vanderbilts,'' a small-scale version of the New York Central Lines, founded by Cornelius Vanderbilt. The model was created using her own trains and has become a favorite display for the younger guests of the house.         Creating an image that has endured among preservationists as well as family members, the Countess appeared at the opening, immediately before the family ball was to begin, clad in a T-shirt with a New York Central logo, an engineer's cap and a bandaged foot.         ''She told me she had hurt it bungee jumping,'' said Alfred Vanderbilt Jr., a cousin.       
         Jeanette Wakin, an expert in the arcane world of medieval Islamic law, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 69 and was a senior lecturer at Columbia University, where she had long been a mainstay in the department of Middle Eastern and Asian language and culture.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, Dr. Wakin, who was born in Bridgeport, Conn., moved to California as a teen-ager, beginning her college studies at the University of California at Los Angeles before completing her undergraduate studies at the New School for Social Research in New York.         For all her Lebanese heritage, Dr. Wakin, a Greek Orthodox Catholic, attributed her interest in Arabic and Islamic studies to a chance course she took as an undergraduate.         Islamic law, which is so abstruse that algebra must be used to calculate inheritances, may not seem like an especially appealing field of scholarship, but once she caught the bug, Dr. Wakin could not shake it off.         After a brief period as travel editor of the Saturday Review, she entered graduate school at Columbia, where she studied under Joseph Schacht, who was widely regarded as a pioneer in the modern study of Islamic legal traditions.         After receiving her master's degree and doctorate, Dr. Wakin remained at Columbia as a member of the faculty, attaining tenure as senior lecturer in 1974 and serving as department chairwoman.         Although she set high standards for her students, Dr. Wakin, who was just as demanding of herself, was a popular teacher. A workhorse who cheerfully accepted administrative tasks others shunned, Dr. Wakin never became a full professor. Her friends attributed the slight to the internecine world of academic politics.         One of her more important scholarly contributions was a 1972 book, ''The Function of Documents in Islamic Law.'' Dr. Wakin was also editor of the Journal of the American Oriental Society and chairwoman of the Columbia Seminar on Arabic Studies.         She took an active and compassionate interest in the modern Islamic world. In 1975, during the war between Lebanon and Israel, she traveled to Lebanon and meticulously gathered the names of Lebanese citizens who had disappeared. More recently, she arranged scholarships at American universities for Muslim students from Bosnia.         Dr. Wakin is survived by a son, Daniel, an Associated Press correspondent in Rome; a sister, Mary Lou Wakin of Manhattan; a brother, Joseph Wakin of Stamford, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Kay Coltoff, a social worker and educator who used her own illness to make things easier for breast cancer survivors, died on March 5 at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 61 and had been a professional-development counselor at Hunter College.         In a career in which she worked as a social worker at hospitals, community centers and drug treatment programs before turning to teaching, Mrs. Coltoff, a native of Mount Vernon, N.Y., who graduated from Emerson College and received her master's in social work from Adelphi University, may have done her most inspired work simply because she developed breast cancer in 1981.         It led her to recognize that in the face of a devastating disease, those with breast cancer need more than medical help; they need psychological and practical support from women who have been there.         Curiously, Mrs. Coltoff seemed to have needed it less than most. She had such an optimistic outlook that her surgeon asked if he could refer other patients to her.         Over the next few years, as she underwent one of the first lumpectomies and later a full mastectomy, Mrs. Coltoff provided informal counseling to so many grateful women that in 1988 she formed a support group that continues to hold weekly meetings in her hometown.         It was hardly a radical idea. Since the late 1960's, for example, the American Cancer Society has operated a program in which breast cancer survivors visit patients in hospitals. Still, in forming a group in which survivors help each other,  Mrs. Coltoff was part of a nationwide  grass-roots movement.         She dropped out of her group after a couple of years, but the knowledge that it was there was a continuing solace, especially after she learned that her cancer had spread. Just a few days before she died, 11 women gathered around her bed to provide a final measure of comfort to a woman who had helped make their own lives easier.         Her survivors include her husband, Philip, executive director of the Children's Aid Society; a son, Peter, of Chicago; a daughter, Julie Adler of Boston, and a grandson.       
         Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the widow of John Hay (Jock) Whitney, the first wife of James Roosevelt and the last of the three glamorous Cushing sisters of Boston, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 89.         Mrs. Whitney was one of the most prestigious figures in New York society, although she disliked publicity and rarely attended large social gatherings. When she did appear at an event, it was considered a coup.         In recent years, in failing health, Mrs. Whitney, a prominent philanthropist in medicine and art, spent most of her time at Greentree, one of the most magnificent private residences in the country, situated on 438 acres in Manhasset, on Long Island's Gold Coast. There, surrounded by an important Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art collection, gardens and greenhouses, Mrs. Whitney was looked after by 20 employees.         Mrs. Whitney was the second-born of the three Cushing sisters, who were renowned in the 1930's and 40's for their brilliant marriages into some of the most prominent families in the country. She inherited the bulk of one of the great American fortunes when Jock Whitney -- sportsman, financier, publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, philanthropist, political mover and shaker, and Ambassador to Britain -- died in 1982. In 1990, Forbes magazine estimated her wealth at $700 million.         Practicing the Art Of Marrying Well         From their debutante days, she and her sisters were celebrated by society chroniclers for their beauty and charm. Her older sister, Mary (Minnie) Cushing, was married to Vincent Astor, the wealthy real estate owner, and after a divorce, to James Whitney Fosburgh, an artist. She died in 1978 at 72. Barbara (Babe) Cushing, the youngest, was married to Stanley Mortimer Jr., a grandson of one of the founders of Standard Oil, and after a divorce, to William S. Paley, the legendary founder and chairman of the Columbia Broadcasting System.         Babe Paley, a perennial name on the world's best-dressed list and a glittering figure in society, also died in 1978, at 62, four months before her older sister.         Betsey Maria Cushing was born in Baltimore on May 18, 1908. Her father was Dr. Harvey Cushing, a neurosurgeon who was a professor of surgery at various times at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities. Her mother was Katherine Crowell Cushing, of a socially prominent family in Cleveland.         Dr. Cushing was a stern father, and Mrs. Whitney later recalled that ''perfectionism was drummed into us.'' The social skills that she learned at Miss May's, a private day school in Boston, and at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn., were burnished by her mother, who made certain that her daughters excelled in the arts of entertaining and running a household as prerequisites for the advantageous marriages she was determined they would have.         David Grafton, the author of the 1992 book ''The Sisters: The Lives and Times of the Fabulous Cushing Sisters'' (Villard Books), wrote that Katherine Cushing once told a gossip columnist that she expected her girls ''to marry into the highest level of European nobility or into America's moneyed aristocracy.''         There were also two brothers, William and Henry, neither of whom survives.         Although marriage into the Roosevelt family did not apparently meet her highest expectations, it merited no objections. Betsey Cushing met James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, when she was 22.         They married at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Brookline, Mass., on June 5, 1930, two days before the bridegroom's graduation from Harvard. Five hundred leaders of the social and political worlds of Boston and New York watched the bride, in a floor-length gown of silver lame, exchange vows with the son of the Governor of New York and his wife. Elliott Roosevelt was his brother's best man, and two other brothers, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. and John A. Roosevelt, were among the ushers. Minnie Cushing was the maid of honor, and Babe Cushing was a bridesmaid.         As a young married woman, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt ''could be imperious,'' the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst later told Mr. Paley's biographer, Sally Bedell Smith. But,  Ms. Smith wrote, ''Fortunately, Betsey redeemed herself with a rollicking sense of humor and an ability to kick up her heels.''         Not Exactly a Favorite Of Eleanor Roosevelt         The young Roosevelts spent their early married life living with the Cushings, while the bridegroom studied law at the Boston University Law School. When Mr. Roosevelt went into the insurance business, the couple bought a house and property in Framingham, Mass. After his father became President of the United States and chose him as an aide, the couple lived in Georgetown.         The young Mrs. Roosevelt was said to be the President's favorite daughter-in-law, but she enjoyed no such preference from Eleanor Roosevelt and was, in turn, not fond of her mother-in-law. ''The two women were simply too strong and too different in personal style and social preferences,'' Mr. Grafton wrote.         Betsey Roosevelt was often the hostess at the White House when Eleanor Roosevelt was absent. She was in the forefront on a summer day in 1939 when the President entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic in Hyde Park, N.Y., at which the King ate his first hot dog. Later that day, when the President took the King and Queen for a drive along the Hudson River, the President asked Betsey Roosevelt to go along for company in the car.         Always family-conscious, she enhanced Babe Cushing's debutante season by giving a tea dance at the White House as a second coming-out party. She also introduced Minnie Cushing to Vincent Astor, and the two were married in 1940 after Mr. Astor divorced his first wife.         Even as a member of the President's circle, Betsey Roosevelt preferred a private life, and she did her best to shield her two daughters, Sara and Kate, from the public eye.         In November 1938, James Roosevelt left the Government and went to Hollywood to work in the movie business as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. His wife followed him, but they separated, and early in 1940 it was disclosed that they were to be divorced. Mr. Roosevelt filed for divorce on grounds of desertion, and his wife filed a cross-complaint on grounds of desertion and cruelty.         In March 1940, Mrs. Roosevelt obtained a divorce decree. She was given custody of the children, child support, a settlement and further payments until she remarried.         Mr. Roosevelt went on to become a decorated Marine officer in World War II, a six-term Congressman from California and a delegate to the United Nations during the Johnson Administration. He died in 1991.         Early in 1942, rumors of a romance between Betsey Cushing Roosevelt and Jock Whitney began circulating in New York, Boston and Washington. He had been divorced in 1940 after 10 years of marriage to the former Mary Elizabeth Altemus.         The couple were married in a small, informal ceremony on March 1, 1942, in her widowed mother's East 86th Street apartment. The bride was 33 and the bridegroom 37.         After a honeymoon at Greenwood Plantation in Thomasville, Ga., one of Mr. Whitney's many residences, the newlyweds moved to Washington, where he ran the motion picture division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, headed by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Whitney later joined the Air Force, rose to colonel, was a German prisoner for 18 days in 1944 before escaping and got several decorations.         In 1949, Mr. Whitney adopted his wife's two daughters. The Whitneys moved to London in 1957, when President Eisenhower named Mr. Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Mrs. Whitney renewed her friendship with the Queen Mother, whom she had met on the 1939 visit to America. Both Ambassador and Mrs. Whitney became close to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.         Mrs. Whitney spent a good deal of her time making the Whitney residences comfortable and welcoming. In his book, Mr. Grafton quoted a friend of hers as saying, ''The Jock Whitneys are just about as 'down-to-earth' as any people can be with a quarter of a billion dollars.''         White House Is Nice, But It's No Greentree         The residences that Mrs. Whitney had at her disposal over the years included, in addition to Greentree on Long Island and the plantation in Georgia, a town house and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island near New London, Conn.; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races there; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Ga., and a spacious house in Surrey, England, not far from the Ascot racecourse.         E. J. Kahn, Mr. Whitney's biographer, reported that years later one of the daughters, Kate, once took her own children on a tour of the White House. Mr. Kahn wrote, ''After inspecting it, they pronounced it nice enough but hardly on a par with Greentree.''         In addition, the Whitneys shared a renowned Kentucky horse farm, which also bore the name Greentree, with Mr. Whitney's sister, Joan Whitney Payson. It was later sold.         Mrs. Whitney established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups, and she was its president. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950's on 15 acres donated by Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Payson.         Mrs. Whitney was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art, Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. The Modern received eight major paintings, by artists like Utrillo, Picasso and Seurat, from Mr. Whitney's estate, and Yale received six paintings, valued at $5 million at that time. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center received a $15 million gift.         After her husband's death in 1982, Mrs. Whitney gave $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art got nine American and French paintings, which had been placed in a charitable trust during Mr. Whitney's lifetime. The trust also gave $2 million for acquisitions, and Mrs. Whitney chose a Toulouse-Lautrec painting from her husband's collection, ''Marcelle Lender Dancing the Bolero in 'Chilperic,' '' to give the gallery in his memory.         Mrs. Whitney made art history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene ''At the Moulin de la Galette.'' It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction.         Among Mrs. Whitney's many public activities were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service.         She is survived by her daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, both of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Jeanette Wakin, an expert in the arcane world of medieval Islamic law, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 69 and a senior lecturer at Columbia University, where she had long been a mainstay in the department of Middle East and Asia Language and Culture.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, Dr. Wakin, who was born in Bridgeport, Conn., moved to California as a teen-ager, beginning her college studies at the University of California at Los Angeles before completing her undergraduate studies at the New School for Social Research in New York.         For all her Lebanese heritage, Dr. Wakin, a Greek Catholic, attributed her interest in Arabic and Islamic studies to a chance course she took as an undergraduate.         Islamic law, which is so abstruse that algebra had to be invented to calculate inheritancies, may not seem like an especially appealing field of scholarship, but once she caught the bug, Dr. Wakin could not shake it off.         After a brief period as travel editor of the Saturday Review, she entered graduate school at Columbia, where she studied under Joseph Schacht, who was widely regarded as a pioneer in the modern study of Islamic legal traditions.         After receiving her master's degree and doctorate, Dr. Wakin, whose name is pronounced WAY-kin, remained at Columbia as a member of the faculty, attaining tenure as senior lecturer in 1974 and serving as department chairman.         Although she set high standards for her students, Dr. Wakin, who was just as demanding of herself, was a popular teacher. A workhorse who cheerfully accepted administrative tasks others shunned, Dr. Wakin never became a full professor. Her friends attributed the slight to the internecine world of academic politics, one of the few fields as tortuously complex as Islamic law.         One of her more important scholarly contributions was her 1972 book, ''The Function of Documents in Islamic Law.''         Dr. Wakin was also the editor of the Journal of the American Oriental Society and chairman of the prestigious Columbia Seminar on Arabic Studies.         She took an active and compassionate interest in the modern Islamic world. During the war in Lebanon in 1975, she meticulously gathered the names of Lebanese citizens who had disappeared during the conflict with Israel, and more recently she arranged scholarships at American universities for Muslim students from Bosnia.         Dr. Watkin, who created some confusion by marrying and later divorcing a man with the same surname as her own, is survived by a son, Daniel, an Associated Press correspondent in Rome; a sister, Mary Lou Wakin of Manhattan; a brother, Joseph Wakin of Stamford, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Bella S. Abzug, New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist, politician and lawyer, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77.         She died of complications following heart surgery, said Harold Holzer, who was her spokesman when she served in Congress. She had been hospitalized for weeks, and had been in poor health for several years, he said.         Ms. Abzug represented the West Side of Manhattan for three Congressional terms in the 1970's. She  brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character. Often called just Bella, she was recognizable everywhere by her big hats and a voice that Norman Mailer said ''could boil the fat off a taxicab driver's neck.''         She opposed the Vietnam War, championed what was then called women's liberation and was one of the first to call for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. Long after it ceased to be fashionable, she called her politics radical. During her last campaign, for Congress in 1986, she told The New York Times, ''I am not a centrist.''         Bella Abzug was a founding feminist, and an enduring one. In the movement's giddy, sloganeering early days, Ms. Abzug was, like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, an icon, the hat bobbing before the cameras at marches and rallies.         After leaving the House in January 1977, she worked for women's rights for two more decades. She founded an international women's group that worked on environmental issues. And she was a leader of a conference of nongovernmental organizations that paralleled the United Nations' fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.         Even then, she continued to rankle.  Former President George Bush, on a private visit to China that coincided with the Beijing conference, said to a meeting of food production executives: ''I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around. Bella Abzug is one who has always represented the extremes of the women's movement.''         When told of Mr. Bush's remark, Ms. Abzug, 75 and in a wheelchair, retorted: ''He was addressing a fertilizer group? That's appropriate.''         Her forceful personality and direct manner made her a lightning rod for criticism from those who opposed the idea of holding a women's conference. After Bob Dole, then the Senate majority leader, said he could not imagine why anyone ''would want to attend a conference co-chaired by Bella Abzug,'' she responded that she was not running the meeting but simply participating with more than 30,000 other women over how best to achieve equal rights.         But much of what Ms. Abzug agitated for -- abortion rights, day care, laws against employment discrimination -- was by that time mainstream political fare.         In Congress, ''she was first on almost everything, on everything that ever mattered,'' said Esther Newberg, Ms. Abzug's first administrative assistant and one of many staff members who quit but remained devoted. ''She was first to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, first to call for an end to the war.''         Ms. Abzug made enemies easily -- ''Sometimes the hat and the mouth took over,'' Ms. Newberg said -- but Ms. Abzug saw that as a consequence of a refusal to compromise, as well as a matter of sport. Of her time in the House, Ms. Abzug wrote in a journal that was published in 1972 as ''Bella,'' ''I spend all day figuring out how to beat the machine and knock the crap out of the political power structure.''         She worked relentlessly at organizing and coalition-building. A founder of Women Strike for Peace and the National Women's Political Caucus, she spent a lifetime prodding for change, with a lawyer's enthusiasm for political channels, through organizations from the P.T.A. to the United Nations.         She made friends easily, too. ''She's fierce and intense and funny,'' said her longtime friend Gloria Steinem. ''She takes everyone seriously. When she argues with you fiercely, it's because she takes you seriously. And she's willing to change her mind. That's so rare.''         Her First Speech, In a Subway Station         Bella Savitzky Abzug was born on July 24, 1920 in the Bronx, the second daughter of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father, Emanuel Savitzky, whom Ms. Abzug later described as ''this humanist butcher,'' ran (and named) the Live and Let Live Meat Market on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan.         She said she knew from the age of 11 that she wanted to be a lawyer, and not long afterward gave her first public speech, in a subway station, while collecting for a Zionist youth organization. She went from Hunter College, where she was student body president, to Columbia University Law School, where she was an editor of The Law Review, to a practice representing union workers.         Ms. Abzug traced the wearing of her trademark wide-brimmed hats to those days. She once recalled: ''When I was a young lawyer, I would go to people's offices and they would always say: 'Sit here. We'll wait for the lawyer.' Working women wore hats. It was the only way they would take you seriously.         ''After a while, I started liking them. When I got to Congress, they made a big thing of it. So I was watching. Did they want me to wear it or not? They didn't want me to wear it, so I did.''         All the while, she was a leftist and an agitator. Later, exasperated with her Congressional aides, she wrote: ''I just don't understand young people today, quite frankly. Our struggle was political, ideological and economic, and we felt we couldn't make something of ourselves unless we bettered society. We saw the two together.''         In the 1950's, Ms. Abzug's law practice turned to other cases identified with the left. One client was Willie McGee, a black Mississippian convicted of raping a white woman and sentenced to death. Ms. Abzug, who was pregnant at the time, argued the case in Mississippi while white supremacist groups threatened her. Though the Supreme Court stayed the execution twice, Mr. McGee was eventually executed.         She also represented people accused of Communist activities by Senator Joseph McCarthy's Congressional committee and its counterpart in Albany.         In the 1960's, Ms. Abzug became an antiwar activist. A founder of Women Strike for Peace, she became its chief lobbyist, protesting nuclear testing and, later, the Vietnam War. She organized insurgent Democrats into other groups, too, becoming a leader of the movement against President Lyndon B. Johnson and a prominent figure in the 1968 Presidential campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy.         During those years, Ms. Abzug started navigating New York City politics. She and her husband, Martin, moved from Mount Vernon, the Westchester suburb where they had raised their two daughters, to a town house at 37 Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In 1970, Ms. Abzug ran for Congress.         The 19th Congressional District, which snaked from lower Manhattan  to the West 80's, had four registered Democrats to every Republican and had been represented in Congress for seven terms by Leonard Farbstein, a  solid but rather somnolent liberal. Ms. Abzug won the Democratic primary with 54 percent of the vote.         Campaign Became A Women's Crusade         At this point, Bella Abzug became national news, a flash of local color in a political year. She seemed to be everywhere, clapping backs and jabbing biceps. Her campaign headquarters next to the Lion's Head, a writers' and journalists' bar in Greenwich Village, was also a day-care center for her legions of female volunteers. The women's crusade she led brought considerable, if sometimes derisive, attention.         Though she eventually took 55 percent of the vote, she had genuine Republican opposition, unusual in an era when New York's main political action consisted of various Democratic factions knifing one another. The Republican-Liberal candidate was Barry Farber, a well-known radio talk show host. Mr. Farber drew many Democrats who resented Mr. Farbstein's humiliation or were simply put off by Ms. Abzug's style.         To her chagrin, Mr. Farber accused Ms. Abzug, who advocated direct negotiations between Israelis and Arabs, of flagging in her support of Israel. For years after that, she made a point of stating her Jewish credentials, dating to childhood: her family was religious and she went regularly to synagogue (though she was bothered that women were relegated to the back rows of the balcony), studied Hebrew and was enrolled for a time at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         When Ms. Abzug went to Washington, she sought an appointment to the Armed Services Committee. She wanted a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam and she vowed to take on the military-industrial complex. She wanted to end the draft. She wanted national health insurance, money for  day-care centers and housing, and more money for New York City, all to be paid for with billions siphoned from the Pentagon's budget.         She got little of this, but during the next six years ''she was indefatigable,'' Ms. Newberg recalled. ''She yelled a lot,only because she couldn't get everything done.'' And if she couldn't, Ms. Newberg added, it was partly because ''her agenda was too pure for her moment in time.''         Ms. Abzug did become expert at parliamentary rules, worked them skillfully and was famously well prepared for every vote, hearing and committee spat. The ''sunshine law'' requiring governing bodies to meet publicly came out of a subcommittee she headed. She coaxed funds for New York from the Public Works Committee. She was a co-sponsor of  the women's equal rights amendment. ''She was one of the most exciting, enlightened legislators that ever served in the Congress,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, with whom Ms. Abzug sometimes collaborated and sometimes sparred.         From her first day on Capitol Hill -- the day she dismayed her colleagues by introducing her Vietnam resolution -- Ms. Abzug derided the Congressional club, the seniority system, the log-rolling and back-scratching. She did not spare fellow Democrats; when she spoke of liberals, it was usually dismissively. She badgered the House leadership over committee appointments and votes.         She badgered the President, too. Invited to a reception at Richard Nixon's White House, she accepted (while writing in her journal, ''Who wants to listen to his pious idiocies?''), then announced to Nixon in the receiving line that her constituents demanded a withdrawal from Vietnam.         For all of her railing against Democrats who went along to get along,  Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill named her one of his dozen assistant whips, and by most accounts she worked well with some of the crustiest fixtures in the House.         Still, a 1972 report by Ralph Nader  estimated that Ms. Abzug's sponsorship of a measure often cost it 20 to 30 votes. Her reputation as an irritant came from all quarters. Jimmy Breslin wrote of a campaign worker who repaired to the Lion's Head one night, holding his side and swearing never to work for Ms. Abzug again. ''She punched me,'' he explained, in a quarrel over scheduling. The next day, Mr. Breslin reported, Ms. Abzug called the aide. ''Michael, I called to apologize,'' she said. ''How's your kidney?''         Mr. Breslin also recounted the Congresswoman's introduction to Sol Linowitz, the former chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a Democratic Party luminary: ''Are you the man that used to be head of the Xerox?'' Ms. Abzug asked. ''That's right,'' Mr. Linowitz replied. ''I'm glad to meet a big shot,'' Ms. Abzug said. ''I'm in hock $35,000 on my campaign.''         Ms. Abzug acknowledged loneliness in her years in Congress. ''Outside of Martin and the kids, I don't feel very related to most people at this point,'' she wrote in 1971. ''I feel detached in social situations. I'm always thinking about other things, about Congress, about the issues, about the political coalition I'm trying to organize. It never leaves me. I even have trouble relating to some of my closest friends, though God knows I still love them, even if they don't know it.''         Always, she returned to Manhattan to spend weekends with her husband.         She had married Martin Abzug in 1944. The two New Yorkers met on a bus in Miami, when both were on the way to a Yehudi Menuhin concert. Mr. Abzug, a stockbroker and an author of two published novels, had next to no interest in politics. In an interview in 1970, he murmured, while his wife was out of the room, ''The political bug is a curious bug.'' But he was, she said, her best friend and supporter, and ''one of the few unneurotic people left in society.''         Corrosive Ambition Hampers a Career         Ms. Abzug's own ambition was too corrosive for many people, even -- or, perhaps, especially -- for her fellow New York Democrats. When the State Legislature sliced up her district in 1972, they urged her to challenge one of the two conservative incumbent Democrats in adjoining districts, Representative John J. Rooney or Representative John M. Murphy. Instead, she opposed a liberal Democrat, William Fitts Ryan, in the 20th District, encompassing the Upper West Side and the Riverdale section of the Bronx.         The primary was bitter and, eventually, politically expensive to Ms. Abzug. Bill Ryan was one of the earliest heroes of the city's insurgent Democrats, an early opponent of the  Vietnam War and a genuinely well-liked man who, as many of his constituents knew, was waging a gallant fight against cancer.         Mr. Ryan defeated Ms. Abzug in the Democratic primary but died before the general election. The Democratic County Committee appointed Ms. Abzug as the candidate to replace him, but she was challenged by Mr. Ryan's widow, Priscilla, who ran on the Liberal line. Ms. Abzug won in November, but she had made dedicated enemies who believed she was an overly aggressive politician who would not hesitate to attack anyone who got in her way. Ten years later, she was denied a seat in the state's delegation to the national party's biannual conference because New York leaders considered her disruptive.         In 1976, she gave up her House seat to run for the Senate. She lost in the primary, to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, by a margin of only 1 percent. Two more campaigns quickly followed. (In a 1978 interview, she said: ''I'm a politician. I run for office. That's my profession.'') She lost to Edward I. Koch in a crowded mayoral primary in 1977. The next year, running for the House again, she lost, again by just 1 percent, to a little-known Republican, S. William Green.         She was appointed co-chairwoman  of President Jimmy Carter's National Advisory Committee on Women, and then, after disagreeing with him over economic policy, was dismissed. The majority of the committee members resigned in protest. Ms. Abzug, unapologetic, said with a shrug, ''I've got to find myself another big, nonpaying job.''         Her next and last campaign was in 1986, this time for a House seat in Westchester County. She won the primary in a burst of the old, ebullient campaigning style, but lost in November to Joseph J. DioGuardi, the Republican incumbent.         It was during that campaign that Martin Abzug died. Her friends said Ms. Abzug never recovered. Nine years later, she said, , ''I haven't been entirely the same since.''         There was one more bid for office, for her old House seat on the Upper West Side, when she announced her candidacy to replace Representative Ted Weiss on his death just before the 1992 election. But she was quickly eliminated from the field at the party convention.         During the next decade, Ms. Abzug suffered from ill health, including breast cancer, but continued to practice law and work for women's groups. She wrote a book, ''Gender Gap,'' with her old friend Mim Kelber. She started a lobbying group called Women U.S.A. and founded the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a group that works with international agencies.         In addition to her daughters, Eve and Liz, Ms. Abzug is survived by her sister, Helene Alexander of Great Neck, N.Y.         ''I've been described as a tough and noisy woman, a prizefighter, a man hater, you name it,'' Ms. Abzug said of herself in ''Bella.'' ''They call me Battling Bella, Mother Courage and a Jewish mother with more complaints than Portnoy.''         ''There are those who say I'm impatient, impetuous, uppity, rude, profane, brash and overbearing. Whether I'm any of these things or all of them, you can decide for yourself. But whatever I am -- and this ought to be made very clear at the outset -- I am a very serious woman.''       
         Baroness Lestor of Eccles, a crusading British politician who spoke out against apartheid in defiance of her Government's policies and who struck a blow on behalf of single mothers when she won the right to adopt two children on her own, died in a hospice in London on Friday. She was 66 and had been suffering from motor neurone disease.         Lady Lestor had two great causes in her life: the fight against racism and the fight for the rights of children, and was never afraid to criticize her party when she disagreed with its policies.         She was briefly chairman of the Labor Party in 1977-78 and served as a junior minister in several Labor Governments in the early 1970's, but was perhaps too uncompromising in her beliefs to rise to a higher office. She was, an admirer once said, ''the heart and soul of the Labor Party.''         Joan Lestor was born on Nov. 13, 1931, in Vancouver, British Columbia, to parents steeped in the international labor movement. Her mother, Esther, had been a machinist in a textile factory in East London who, as a teen-ager, became a shop steward for the garment workers' union; her father, Charles, a journalist and actor, was a leading member of the Canadian Socialist Party and later, when the family returned to England, of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.         Ms. Lestor graduated from London University with a diploma in sociology and went to work as a nursery school teacher, opening a nursery school in her own home six years later. At the same time she pursued a career in politics. Disillusioned by what she considered the extremism of her father's party, she joined Labor at the age of 24, won several local elections and was elected to Parliament in 1966. She remained there, with a four-year break, until 1997.         She immediately threw herself into the issues that consumed her, introducing a bill to tighten regulations on nursery schools and providers of child care; fighting the Government's attempt to stop paying social security benefits to unwed mothers, and working to insure that abandoned wives could obtain financial support from their husbands.         She was passionate about the rights of abused children, saying in a 1989 debate that while it was necessary to ''strike a balance'' between the rights of children and the rest of the family, ''in my book, the rights of the children are paramount.''         Her jobs in the Labor Governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan often became jeopardized by the rigor of her principles. In 1974, when she was appointed a junior minister in the Foreign Office with special responsibility for African affairs, she earned the nickname ''the African Queen'' and repeatedly clashed with her superiors over her strong anti-apartheid views.         Ms. Lestor was then moved to a ministerial job in the Education Department. But she resigned after a year in protest over spending cuts that threatened the jobs of thousands of teachers and forced the postponement of her goal to change the age when students left state-financed secondary schools to 16, from 15.         With the Conservatives in power through the 1980's and into the 1990's, Ms. Lestor worked as the opposition's chief spokeswoman on a number of issues, including children and the family, juvenile crime and race relations. She resigned from her last opposition post, as spokeswoman for overseas development, in 1996, saying that she was too ill to continue.         In 1997 she was made a Baroness and elevated to the House of Lords.         A flamboyant, warmhearted woman who listed her hobbies in Who's Who as ''playing with children and animals,'' Lady Lestor relished adversarial politics and was not shy about telling people what she thought, in the plainest possible language.         When she heard that Rupert Allason, a fellow Member of Parliament and an espionage expert, was about to accuse her publicly of spying for the K.G.B., she confronted him and showered him with invective. ''Perhaps I used words no lady should,'' she conceded later.         She was married briefly as a teen-ager in 1948, but the marriage was dissolved and she never remarried. She wanted children, nonetheless, and fought for the right to adopt them herself, despite being single.         When she won her case, she cried with happiness, and went on to adopt her son, David, in 1967, and her daughter, Susan, in 1969. She loved being a grandmother, and caused roars of laughter in Parliament when she announced, in a wicked nod at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who had grandly used the royal ''we'' in noting the birth of her first grandchild, that ''we too became a grandmother.''         When she received her peerage, she said she celebrated by baking muffins for her grandchildren; having them, she said, was ''even better than being in love.''       
         Felicie Young Cormier and Marie-Louise Febronie Meilleur, who lived through more tumultuous history, saw more social and technological change and endured more late-life congratulations than any two people known to be alive, died within two days of each other this week, ending their rival reigns as the world's oldest living person.         Mrs. Cormier, who had no birth certificate but traced her birth date through family records to Nov. 9, 1879, was 118 when she died two minutes before midnight on Tuesday at a nursing home in Crowley, La.         Mrs. Meilleur, who had a birth certificate and other proofs of age that qualified her for the oldest living person listing in the Guinness Book of World Records, was 117 when she died on Thursday afternoon at a nursing home in North Bay, Ontario.         Both women had received considerable attention during the last decade of parallel lives that had been devoted almost exclusively to their large families.         When Mrs. Cormier, the daughter of former slaves, was born in New Iberia, La., during Reconstruction, Rutherford B. Hayes was President of the 38 United States and Thomas Alva Edison had just invented the electric light bulb.         Sir John A. MacDonald, Canada's first Prime Minister, was in his second term when Mrs. Meilleur was born in Kamouraska, Quebec, on Aug. 29, 1880, 13 years after the consolidation of Canada.         The daughter of a fisherman who operated a hotel, Mrs. Meilleur, whose maiden name was Levesque, was educated at a local convent, married a man named Leclerc and had four children before her husband died of pneumonia in the early years of the century. In 1915 she married Hector Meilleur and moved to Rapide des Joachims, Quebec, where her husband worked as a forest ranger during the summer and as a lumberman during the winter, while Mrs. Meilleur had six more children, bringing her total to 10.         Mrs. Cormier recalled growing up at a time of such racial tension that after her family was given some land by a white woman grateful that little Felicie had nursed her through a bout of smallpox when no one else would take the job, the Ku Klux Klan drove the family away.         She later lived in Morgan City and New Orleans, where she met her husband, Joseph Ellis Cormier, who had six children when the couple were married. Together they had seven more children, but Mrs. Cormier, who brought up all 13, refused to make a distinction between the two sets of children and claimed them all as her own.         Mrs. Cormier, who lived in her own house in Crowley, attended only by a part-time nursing assistant, until she entered the nursing home last September, was inevitably glib during the annual spate of birthday interviews.         In recent years this gave her something of an edge over Mrs. Meilleur, who had been virtually blind and deaf since entering the nursing home in 1989.         Mrs. Meilleur's family, though, kept better records. In addition to four children, Gabriel Vaugh of Barrie, Olive Therrien of Peterborough, Rita Coote of Deep River and Ernie Meilleur, who lives in the same nursing home his mother lived in, Mrs. Meilleur is survived by 85 grandchildren, 80 great-grandchildren, 57 great-great-grandchildren and 4 great-great-great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Cormier, who claimed 37 grandchildren and 100 great-grandchildren a dozen years, had since lost count, said her son, Herbert, of Crowley.         Although she generally cited hard work as the reason for her longevity, Mrs. Meilleur, who was known to enjoy a glass of wine, had perhaps added to her life span when she quit smoking at the age of 90. Mrs. Cormier, her family said, neither smoked nor drank. She attributed her longevity to taking care of her self and going to bed early and getting up early.         For all the public interest in longevity, the deaths of the two women suggest a trend: the world's oldest people do not seem to be as old as they used to. The last oldest person,  Jeanne Louise Calment of France, was 122 at her death last August.       
         The Rev. Sandra Jishu Holmes, a Zen Buddhist priest, teacher and co-founder of the Greyston Mandala, an organization in Yonkers dedicated to helping the poor, died on Feb. 20 at a hospital in Albuquerque, N.M. She was 57 and had moved last month to Santa Fe, N.M., from Yonkers.         The cause was a heart attack, the Greyston Foundation announced.         Ms. Holmes and her husband, Roshi Bernard Tetsugen Glassman, a Zen teacher, founded a group of nonprofit and for-profit companies and gave it the name of the Buddhist and Hindu circle of life, the mandala. As a team in meditation and activism, the couple helped renovate dilapidated buildings to house the homeless. They also aided the homeless with training, jobs in the Greyston Bakery and children's services.         They worked with drug addicts and alcoholics, former offenders and the chronically unemployed to offer an alternative to government programs. The couple opened a building for 19 families with a day care center and access to social services in 1991. The group's for-profit bakery produces cakes, tarts and chocolate-fudge brownie chips for Ben & Jerry's ice cream and frozen yogurt.         Ms. Holmes retired in 1996 as director of new projects at the Greyston Foundation, the umbrella organization of the Greyston Group. She and her husband then founded the Zen Peacemaking Order, an international community that pursues meditation and interfaith expression and whose headquarters they recently moved to New Mexico.         Ms. Holmes was born in Oakland, Calif. She received a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Columbia University in 1976. After meeting Mr. Glassman in 1982, she devoted herself to Zen Buddhist study and practice. She became a Zen priest in 1983 and, four years ago, a teacher.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Guy and Audrey Holmes of Stockton, Calif., and three brothers: David, of Plattsburgh, N.Y., Vernon, of Oakland, and Warren, of Stockton.         Correction:  April 22, 1998, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about the Rev. Sandra Jishu Holmes, a Zen Buddhist priest and teacher and a co-founder of the Greyston Mandala in Yonkers, misstated the date of her death. It was March 20, not Feb. 20.       
         Joanne Eve Lukomnik, a consultant and lifelong advocate of community health services who was also active in national professional and policy-making health groups, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 51.         The cause was complications from multiple myeloma, her family said.         Over the years, Dr. Lukomnik held teaching, medical and administrative positions at Columbia University's School of Public Health, the United States Public Health Service, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Jersey City Family Health Center, among others.         She was on many committees and boards of the American Public Health Association and was elected chairwoman in 1995. Her other associations included the National Conference on Primary Care, sponsored jointly by the Federal Public Health Service and the Kellogg, Kaiser and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations. She was also a member of the editorial board of The Journal of the American Medical Women's Association.         She was raised in the Bronx, studied sociology and anthropology at Reed College, and graduated with a degree in fine arts from New York University in 1969. She took premedical studies at Columbia and received her M.D. in 1975 from the State University Health Science Center in Stony Brook, N.Y..         She held a master's degree in public health from Columbia, and she studied sociology at the University of Edinburgh and social medicine at the Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem.         Dr. Lukomnik is survived by her husband, Len Rodberg; two children, Simon and Josie Rodberg of Manhattan; her mother, Mary Lukomnik of the Bronx, and her brothers, David and Jon Lukomnik, both of Manhattan.       
         Florence Skelly Altman, an innovator in opinion research, died on Tuesday at Scottsdale, Ariz., Memorial Hospital. She was 73 and lived in Scottsdale.         The cause of death was complications of heart disease, her daughter, Alexandra Altman, said.         Ms. Skelly, as she was known professionally, was instrumental in developing many techniques that are now standard in market research, including the use of simulated test markets to estimate the potential of new products. Today, variations of the method are used by major packaged goods marketing companies such as Procter & Gamble.         ''She had a great flair for the numbers side of the business, but saw the human implications of the numbers like no one I have ever known,'' said Daniel Yankelovich, a partner of Ms. Skelly at the opinion research firm that bore their names.         The social implications of Ms. Skelly's work were apparent in a study of younger Americans she and Mr. Yankelovich conducted in the late 1960's, among the first to call them baby boomers.         Arthur H. White, another partner and a professional colleague of Ms. Skelly for 50 years, said, ''The study revealed gender and race problems, that we had a society in which large segments of the population were not treated as well as other segments and that attitudes about institutions were changing.''         ''In those studies,'' he added, ''we saw that most people did not want to accept everything an employer or the Government said.''         Ms. Skelly had firsthand experience with sex discrimination early in her career. Mr. White recalled a meeting in the 1950's that he, Ms. Skelly and another male executive from Stewart Dougall, a New York research firm where she worked early on, were asked to attend with the board of the New York Stock Exchange. ''She had to sit outside in the hall while we, the two men, went in to talk,'' Mr. White said.         Suffering such indignities did little to dispel what her colleagues said was an admirable disposition.         ''She was a wonderful, witty person, very funny but serious at the same time, which is a great combination,'' Mr. Yankelovich said. ''Our clients loved her, and she loved the business.''         Ms. Skelly, a longtime resident of New York, moved to Scottsdale in the mid-1990's. She was a graduate of Hunter College, where her senior honors paper in social psychology, based on a public opinion survey of a Y.W.H.A. project in New York, exhibited her interest in market research.         She spent four years at Stewart Dougall, went to Washington for two years and worked on the 1950 Census, and then returned to the firm.         In 1961 she and Mr. White left to join Mr. Yankelovich. Later in the decade, the firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. was renamed Yankelovich, Skelly & White. In 1986, two years after the firm was bought by the  Saatchi & Saatchi Company, the advertising concern, Mr. Yankelovich, Ms. Skelly and Mr. White left to start another firm, citing policy disagreements.         Until her death Ms. Skelly served as vice chairwoman of the new firm, DYG Inc., based in Danbury, Conn. (Saatchi & Saatchi sold the former Yankelovich, Skelly & White, now Yankelovich Partners, in 1992.)         In recognition of her contributions to the field, in 1990 the Market Research Council inducted Ms. Skelly into its Market Research Hall of Fame.         Over the years Ms. Skelly served on numerous boards, including the National Council of Christians and Jews, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Business Advisory Board and the Warnaco Corporation.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, Ms. Skelly is survived by her husband, Eugene Altman of Scottsdale, and a son, Jonathan Altman of Los Angeles.       
         Dr. Viola Wertheim Bernard, a prominent New York psychiatrist who found ways to help adopted and foster children feel at home in new surroundings, died on March 21 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 91 and also lived in Nyack, N.Y.         Her prescription for easing the way for adopted children into a new home was to arrange for them to visit the new place in advance. ''Helping children to see where they are going reduces the fear of strangeness,'' she advised.         Throughout her professional life, she worked to widen the applications of psychoanalytic theory to study and tackle social problems. A past vice president of the American Psychiatric Association, she won international recognition for her work in community and social psychiatry, child psychiatry and adoption.         In an association with Columbia University that spanned five decades, she founded its Division of Community and Social Psychiatry and directed it from 1956 to 1969. She was also a founder of what is now the Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. At her death, she was clinical professor emeritus at the Psychoanalytic Center for Training and Research at Columbia.         Dr. Bernard opened her Upper East Side medical practice in 1940 as a specialist in psychiatry and psychoanalysis. The author of about 100 papers and several books, she recently finished her latest article on the relevance of psychiatry and psychoanalysis in social contexts,  said Kathleen L. Kelly, an executor. It will appear in the forthcoming issue of The Psychoanalytic Review.         Dr. Bernard's writings also addressed topics like children and adolescents and their position in family, community and the law; mental health and the schools; community and social psychiatry and training, and the dynamics of psychiatry among the poor, particularly among minorities.         A Manhattan native, she graduated from New York University in 1933 and earned her medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1936. She trained in psychiatry and neurology at Jersey City Medical Center, Grasslands Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., and the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Hospital.         Dr. Bernard leaves no immediate family. She was married in the 1930's to Theos C. Bernard, an anthropologist, who died in 1948, 10 years after their divorce.       
         Eleanor C. Lambertsen, a leader in American nursing education who introduced the concept of team nursing for better patient care, died on March 30 at Waverly Heights, a nursing home in Gladwyne, Pa. She was 82 and a former resident of the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was Parkinson's disease, according to Teachers College of Columbia University, where Dr. Lambertsen headed the department of nursing education from 1961 to 1970 and taught doctoral courses on nursing leadership into the late 1980's.         Dr. Lambertsen started her career in the 1930's as a bedside nurse at Overlook Hospital of Nursing in Summit, N.J. The idea of team nursing sprang from her doctoral dissertation, and in the decades afterward, the concept made her a mentor and teacher to generations of health professionals around the world.         ''The purpose of team nursing,'' Dr. Lambertsen wrote in her dissertation, ''is to blend different kinds of nurses into the working unit whose core is the patient and his individual nursing needs.''         She devoted her career to converting nurses, doctors and hospital administrators to the concept. As nurses and nurse executives followed her lead, she worked to uphold high educational standards and to raise the esteem in which nurses were held.         The teams she envisioned were led by doctors and experienced nurses who coordinated the work of physical and occupational therapists, social workers and others. She also took the concept to classrooms and hospital wards in this country and overseas as a consultant to governments and nursing organizations she helped to inspire.         A native of Fanwood, N.J., she graduated from Overlook Hospital in 1938 and rose to director of the school of nursing services there in 1945. She received her bachelor's (1949), master's (1950) and doctoral degrees (1957) in education from Teachers College.         Her dissertation spelled out her idea of team nursing, and it was published as a book by Teachers College Press under the title ''Nursing Team Organization and Functioning.'' The dissertation led to a demonstration project at Francis Delafield Hospital, a cancer hospital in Manhattan.         The demonstration attracted administrators from across the country who sought to reorganize their nursing staffs according to Dr. Lambertsen's team concept.         In the previous system, called functional nursing, one nurse delivered medication, another bathed patients and so forth.         Dr. Lambertsen's plan called for registered nurses to work closely with doctors to oversee patient care and treatment goals and to coordinate nurses' roles. Daily nurse conferences were held to review care plans and arrange the duties of licensed practical nurses, therapists and other aides.         The American Nurses Association honored Dr. Lambertsen in 1984 for originating the concept of team nursing. It also praised her role as principal investigator in studies that advanced nursing education and documented the need for the proper training of nurses facing greater professional responsibilities.         The association cited her ''pioneering efforts'' to promote the nurse practitioner movement and the nurses' role in delivering primary care. It also praised her efforts to improve the nurses' relationship with other health care professionals. Four years ago, Dr. Lambertsen endowed a research program of the American Nurses Foundation.         In 1970, she was appointed dean of the Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing. In 1974 she became senior associate director of nursing at the hospital, and she held that position for a number of years.         Her husband, Dr. Joseph Anderson, died about 30 years ago. She is survived by two brothers, Herbert and Dr. Christian Lambertsen, both of Irvington, N.J.       
         Belle Zeller, an emeritus professor of political science at Brooklyn College and a scholar of the legislative process who was an indomitable leader of unions representing City University of New York professors for more than 30 years, died on Friday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 95.         Dr. Zeller, who at 83 survived an accident in which she was struck by a bus and critically injured, died in her sleep, said her niece, Laura Glass.         From 1944 until 1972, Dr. Zeller was the chairwoman of the Legislative Conference of the City Colleges, a lobbying group that later became the first union to represent the permanent faculty in the City University system. In 1972, the conference merged with the United Federation of College Teachers, a rival union representing part-time instructors. For the next four years, Dr. Zeller was president of the joint group, the Professional Staff Congress.         As a labor advocate for the professors, Dr. Zeller lobbied for legislation to establish tenure and pensions that today are considered some of the basic rights of public college teachers in New York State. She used her academic expertise in the legislative process to champion the rights of faculty members, becoming a familiar figure at City Hall and the State Capitol.         ''When it came to representing the faculty, she was irrepressible,'' said Irwin H. Polishook, who has been president of Professional Staff Congress since Dr. Zeller retired in 1976. ''She would burst in on legislators who were busy with other business, even if they were behind closed doors, even if they were in conference. Because of who she was, people accepted that. She was able to get people's attention because she was a scholar as well as an activist.''         Belle Zeller was born in New York City on April 8, 1903. She was one of nine children of a couple who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to New York, where her father worked in a shoe factory. Her parents and older siblings often discussed politics around the dinner table and she became fascinated by government at an early age.         She attended Hunter College High School and Hunter College, where she specialized in history and the social sciences, earning a B.A. in 1924 and an M.A. in 1926. She was one of the system's few female professors when she began teaching at Hunter College's Brooklyn campus in 1927. She remained there when it changed its name to Brooklyn College in 1930, becoming one of the institution's founding instructors.         In 1937, she received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University.         Her doctoral dissertation, ''Pressure Politics in New York'' (Prentice Hall, 1937) was one of the first major studies of lobbying in New York State politics and it was reprinted in 1967. She was later recognized nationwide as an authority on lobbying and served as an adviser to Senator John F. Kennedy and other legislators who were revising the Federal Lobbying Registration Act.         Throughout her long career, Dr. Zeller was the recipient of numerous academic awards, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the Graduate School of City University in 1985 and the President's Medal from Brooklyn College on the institution's 50th anniversary in 1980.         Dr. Zeller never married. In addition to Ms. Glass, she is survived by four other nieces and a nephew.       
         Dr. Emily Mudd, a onetime college dropout who trained to be a landscape architect before the trajectory of her life and her own inner fire led her to become a pioneering marriage and family counselor, died on Saturday at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 99 and widely regarded as a giant of the field she helped create.         At a time when more than 25,000 American marriage counselors treat some 2 million troubled marriages a year, it might seem a shade surprising that in 1933, when Mrs. Mudd helped form the Philadelphia Marriage Council, the field was so new there were only two other such organizations in the country.         There were also no established training programs for marriage counselors, which might help explain why her fellow organizers asked Mrs. Mudd to run the Philadelphia program even though she did not have an academic degree.         But she did have a few other credentials. For one thing, she and her husband, Stuart, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, had helped start Pennsylvania's first birth control clinic six years earlier, and her experiences there dealing with often overburdened and sometimes abused wives had led her to see the need for broader family counseling.         Then, too, Mrs. Mudd was the only wife and mother among the academics and social work specialists who met at the Mudds' home to plan the marriage council.         The men were so impressed with their hostess's drive, insights, intuition and commitment that after an elaborate search for a qualified professional, they decided she would be the best person to run the council. It certainly would have been hard to find anyone more dedicated to social change and human improvement.         As a student at Vassar when the United States entered World War I, she was so determined to do her part for the cause that she helped form a Vassar unit of the women's Land Army, established to have women work the fields in place of mobilized farmers.         Her own role in that unit and as a Vassar student came to an end when she drank some fetid water, developed typhoid fever and was advised to avoid stuffy classrooms and seek a career in the fresh air. Accordingly, she studied landscape architecture at a school in Groton, Mass., but before she could begin a career she was diverted by romance.         After her marriage in 1922, Mrs. Mudd spent a decade as her husband's unpaid laboratory assistant, first at Harvard, later at the Rockefeller Institute in New York and then at the Henry Phipps Institute in Philadelphia, winning credit as co-author of 14 of his scientific papers.         After being asked to run the new Philadelphia Marriage Council, she returned to college. Working part time until she obtained a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, Mrs. Mudd, who eventually received her doctorate there, became the council's full-time executive director in 1936 and held the post until her retirement in 1967.         Along the way she helped lay the groundwork for virtually every aspect of professional marriage and family counseling. She formed one of the first counselor training programs, developed the first program to measure counselor effectiveness, wrote several textbooks and lectured widely here and abroad.         Only the third woman to be named to the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school, Dr. Mudd, who later became the first woman to become a full professor there, taught the first course at an American medical school dealing with sexuality, a speciality that led her to help edit Alfred Kinsey's book on female sexuality and to work closely with the Masters and Johnson clinic in St. Louis, to which she contributed thousands of case histories from her own practice.         After her retirement from the Philadelphia Marriage Council, now affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Mudd, who remarried after her first husband's death in 1975, continued to see patients well into her 80's. She also found time to pursue her old landscaping speciality by developing elaborate gardens at her suburban home.         She is survived by two sons, John, of Cambridge, Mass., and Harvey, of Bethesda, Md.; two daughters, Margaret, of Cold Spring, N.Y., and Emily Mitchell of Concord, Mass.; 10 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Sybil Connolly, who designed the linen dress that Jacqueline Kennedy wore in her White House portrait and who elevated Irish style to high fashion, died on Wednesday at her home in Dublin. She was 77.         She had a heart attack, said a family member, John Connolly.         Miss Connolly, whose popularity spanned almost a half century, brought her collection to New York in 1953. She introduced gossamer hand-pleated handkerchief linen, which required nine yards of fabric to pleat into one yard; spidery Carrickmacross lace and a sophisticated palette of hand-woven Irish Donegal tweeds. She was an early exponent of soft and casual clothes when Parisian designers were featuring rigid construction.         ''I must see movement in a dress,'' she once said. ''A woman's body is inside. It breathes. It moves.''         Miss Connolly was an active designer until her death. For many years, most of her designs were sold in this country to Rockefellers, DuPonts and scores of other clients with  social names, many at private showings. She also received clients at her 270-year-old mansion on Merrion Square, one of the most fashionable areas of Dublin.         One of Miss Connolly's most unusual assignments was designing modern habits for three orders of Catholic nuns: the Sisters of Mercy of the United States and the Bon Secour and Marie Repatrice orders of Ireland.         Miss Connolly played an important role in the revival of Irish handicrafts, including crochet, handwoven woolens, basketwork and the development of fragrances. ''A shop window for Ireland'' was how she described her five-story headquarters.         She was often inspired by the clothes favored by rural Irish women. A hooded cloak worn in Kinsale was translated into an elegant velvet evening cape. An unbleached woolen yarn, knitted in different patterns and used in Aran Isles fishermen's sweaters, became an unusual sports outfit. Black Irish shawls and scarlet flannel petticoats were also adapted for more urban tastes.         In addition to her fashion collections, Miss Connolly designed fabrics and wallcoverings for Brunschwig & Fils and Schumacher, and crystal and china for Tiffany & Company. She wrote several books on Irish houses, gardens and crafts, and houses she decorated were featured in a number of magazines.         Miss Connolly was born in Swansea, Wales, on January 24, 1921, the  daughter of an insurance man originally from Waterford, Ireland, and a half-Welsh, half-English mother. She is survived by a sister, Judy Connolly of Dublin.         Her Welsh grandfather, a country squire and scholar, taught her Greek philosophy and private tutors coached her in other subjects. After her father's death, while she was still a teen-ager, she and her mother went  to Ireland, where her only formal education was two years in a convent school.         Her fashion career began in 1938 as an apprentice at Bradley's, a prestigious dressmaking establishment in London. Dowager Queen Mary was a client and Miss Connolly always recalled that at Buckingham Palace fittings ''I was allowed to hold the pins.''         She returned to Ireland in 1940 and joined a Dublin specialty shop as a buyer. Within a decade, she replaced the shop's designer, who had emigrated to the United States. In 1952 her career took a leap forward when a group of Philadelphia matrons, under the auspices of that city's Fashion Group, touched down in Dublin and discovered her.       
         Joan Mareskas Kormendi, the longtime artistic director of the Children's Repertory Group, whose child actors performed at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on May 18 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Katherine Kormendi.         Mrs. Kormendi wrote, directed and produced plays for the theater troupe, which she founded with her husband, Laszlo Kormendi, in 1954. The plays were based on myths from various cultures, including that of ancient Greece.         Mr. Kormendi an international corporate lawyer, looked after fund-raising for the nonprofit foundation. When Mrs. Kormendi retired in the late 1970's, the theater group ceased operation.         The actors ranged in age from 6 to 16. Most of their performances were in the Grace Rainey Rogers Auditorium at the Metropolitan Museum. The performances were in the spring, and Mrs. Kormendi would work with her young actors, mostly nonprofessionals, for many weekends before a performance.         Neither the actors nor Mrs. Kormendi were paid for their efforts. Choreographers and other performing-arts specialists who worked with the troupe were received modest fees. One critic, Meyer Levin, wrote in the 1960's that Mrs. Kormendi ''lets her children act like children do when they make up their own plays -- only she brings this to the point of art.''         She was born and grew up in Belleville, Ontario. She graduated from Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, was an actress in Canada and studied drama at the New School for Social Research, in Manhattan.         She married Mr. Kormendi in 1953; he died in 1985.         Mrs. Kormendi is survived by her daughter.       
         Dame Catherine Cookson, a determined dockside waif who spun the dross of a squalid childhood into gold as one of Britain's most prolific and best-read novelists, died yesterday at her home in a Newcastle suburb. She was 91 and the author of more than 90 novels with a combined distribution of more than 100 million copies.         There's not much to be said for growing up coal poor in Tyneside, the industrial banks of the Tyne in northeastern England, even less for being shamed by an alcoholic mother and never knowing your father.         Then again, by the time she was finished, Dame Catherine had said quite a lot about the grim life she knew as a girl and illuminated in scores of novels, almost all of them set in the same working-class world she grew up dreaming of escaping.         British readers have not seemed to be able to get enough of Dame Catherine's gritty tales of family conflict, social despair and the debilitating effects of deprivation. Dame Catherine has not only regularly accounted for a third of the books circulated by Britain's lending libraries, but of the top 10 titles on last year's circulation list, nine were hers.         Yet she would have been hard-pressed to dream up a more unlikely heroine or a tale as compelling as the story of her own life.         Who, after all, would believe that a woman whose childhood humiliations included frequenting pawn shops, collecting driftwood from the Tyne, being sexually molested at 7 by her mother's boyfriend, and making daily runs to the pub to fetch her mother and tyrannical grandfather pails of beer would become a successful novelist?         Or that a woman whose adult tribulations would include the pain of four pregnancies ending in miscarriage and stillbirth and a devastating nervous breakdown would make an emotional breakthrough at 40, find salvation through writing and end up as Britain's 17th richest woman, with a fortune estimated at $23 million?         Even harder to believe is that Dame Catherine credited the spark that saved her life to her persistent belief as a girl that she was a lady.         It was a belief, she said, that was fired when an aunt mentioned that her father, a topic she could never discuss with her imperious mother, had been a gentleman. And what sort of gentleman would take his pleasure, then abandon a woman he had got with child? As the aunt explained, ''he wore an astrakhan collar, and he carried a silver-mounted walking stick and kid gloves. And, oh yes, he talked lovely.'' (Dame Catherine later speculated that her father had been a gentleman's footman.)         The notion that she had been born a lady took a startling turn when Dame Catherine, then known as Katie McMullen, read in a novel that it was a lady's duty to be educated, which she took to heart, beginning a lifelong habit of reading great books.         She found her immediate escape from poverty by working in laundries, rising to supervisor, saving her money, moving to the southeastern city of Hastings and opening a rooming house for men.         One of her lodgers was a shy, intellectual school teacher named Tom Cookson, and as Dame Catherine later told it, it was close to love at first sight. When she asked him in for coffee after their first movie date, the two sat up talking until after midnight. ''Now,'' she said, ''whether it was him, or whether it was me who first leaned to the other I don't know. But we kissed and that was that.''         After their marriage the couple were inseparable, but after experiencing a stillbirth and three miscarriages Mrs. Cookson, who suffered from a lifelong blood disorder, endured years of suicidal depression until her husband suggested she try to overcome her despair by writing.         Her first book, an autobiographical novel called ''Kate Hannigan,'' was published in 1950, when she was 44, and Mrs. Cookson was on her way. Averaging two books a years, she achieved something of a breakthrough in 1968 with her 19th novel, ''Katie Mulholland,'' and her autobiography, ''Our Kate.''         Although none won literary acclaim, a number of her books, including ''The Black Candle,'' and ''The Velvet Gown,'' were made into television movies, and Mrs. Cookson, an Officer of the British Empire since 1985, was made a Dame, the equivalent of a Knight, in 1993.         Her husband is her only survivor.       
         Mary Bancroft Boulton, a psychotherapist who helped introduce to New York City the practice of transactional analysis, which tries to help a patient correct self-destructive behavior patterns in relationships with other people, died at her home in Greenwich Village on May 30. She was 86.         Transactional analysis became popular after Dr. Eric Berne published ''Games People Play'' in 1964 (reissued in paperback by Ballantine Books in 1996). Dr. Boulton studied with Dr. Berne in San Francisco, then brought the new therapy to New York in 1966 when she founded the New York Transactional Analysis Seminar with Dr. Marian Weisberg and Dr. Barbara Rosenfeld.         Transactional analysis, often done in group therapy, delves into the multiple roles each person plays, as a child or parent, for example. One of Dr. Boulton's sons, John Bancroft, said, ''She would often say to me, 'Well, that's your child speaking,' or, 'That's your parent speaking.' ''         Dr. Boulton was also concerned with the roles thrust upon her patients, particularly women, by society.         In one article, she said patients not only needed to escape from the smothering influence of demanding parents but also needed to defy ''the 'big guns' of our culture -- traditional religious teaching, educational practice, literature, television, and the toys and games which are prescribed for boys and girls.''         The New York seminar, modeled after one run by Dr. Berne, was open to any psychotherapists who wanted to learn the new therapy, Dr. Weisberg said.         The seminar met until 1973, when Dr. Boulton and Dr. Weisberg opened the Gotham Institute for Transactional Analysis, a training institute that closed in 1978. Dr. Boulton continued her private practice until she retired in 1990.         Dr. Boulton was born Mary Elizabeth Holzman in Cincinnati on Aug. 9, 1911. She received a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Cincinnati in 1932 and a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania in 1935. She received her Ph.D. in 1980 from Northern Indiana University.         She married Frank Bancroft in 1935, and they were both active in left-wing causes.         Mr. Bancroft died in 1959. Dr. Boulton married John Wallace in 1962; the marriage ended in divorce.         Dr. Boulton married Schroeder Boulton in 1965, and their home in Greenwich Village became a gathering spot for people in civil rights and antiwar work, Mr. Bancroft said.         Dr. Boulton is survived by her husband; three sons, Carter Bancroft, of Huntington, N.Y., and Michael and John Bancroft, both of Seattle; three stepdaughters, Janet Boulton, of New York, Nancy Boulton, of Lincoln, Mass., and Tiffany Wallace, of Lexington, Ky., and seven grandchildren.       
         Emily Whaley, a South Carolina woman with a green thumb and such an eye for color that she helped show flowering Charleston there was bloom beyond azaleas and camellias and turned her backyard into one of the nation's most acclaimed private gardens, died on Monday at her summer home in Flat Rock, N.C. She was 87 and had become something of celebrity since the publication of a memoir, ''Mrs. Whaley and her Charleston Garden,'' last year.         Her family said the cause was a stroke.         No one would mistake Mrs. Whaley's garden for, say, Longwood Gardens, but as home gardens go, the one she maintained for more than 50 years on a 30-foot by 100-foot plot behind her narrow 1754 white clapboard house at 58 Church Street, a block from the harbor in Charleston's historic district, has been a perennial eye-popper.         Among other things it has been featured in books by Rosemary Vaerey and other garden writers and has been a fixture on the Historic Charleston Foundation's annual garden tours.         The garden has been considered special partly because it was laid out in 1941 by a renowned landscape architect, Loutrell Briggs, who took full advantage of a brick carriage house, a couple of mighty oaks and a magnolia tree on neighboring properties as backdrops of opportunity for a design that included five distinct gardens, or ''rooms,'' as Mrs. Whaley called them.         But mainly it was because Mrs. Whaley filled the Briggs design with repeated flair, adding a statue here, ripping out a bed of plants there and forever experimenting with new plants in varied combinations.         That was not, to be sure, because she hadn't gotten it right the first time, but because her tastes changed every few years.         Until her book, billed as ''a conversation with William Baldwin,'' a  South Carolina novelist, was published by Algonquin Books last year, Mrs. Whaley's fame had been largely local, but well established.         One of the first local gardeners to dare to plant for year-round blooms in a city whose signature azaleas and camellias lose their blossoms in the torrid Charleston summers, Mrs. Whaley helped establish a trend of planting perennials like roses, gerbera daisies and hydrangeas, in front of the towering azalea and camellia shrubs.         She was also one of the first to open her garden to the public to raise money for charities, a practice that attracted some 3,000 paying visitors a year and led some to call her garden the most visited private garden in the country.         For Mrs. Whaley, an accomplished pianist and ballroom dancer who helped start the Cotillion, a dancing school that has become a Charleston social fixture, and once taught chess, gardening came more than naturally. It was, she liked to say, in her genes.         The daughter of a country doctor, Mrs. Whaley was born Emily Kershaw in Pinopolis, a village about 40 miles west of Charleston, and spent part of her childhood at her mother's family's Belvidere Plantation, helping her mother tend a 13-acre garden even as her mother had helped her mother garden.         After attending the University of Georgia she married Ben Scott Whaley, who became a prominent Charleston lawyer, served a term in the state legislature, was United States Attorney for Charleston in the Truman Administration and played a crucial role in creating his wife's garden.         With his wife confined to bed during a difficult pregnancy in the summer of 1941, Mr. Whaley asked if there was some special present she would like. She said yes, a garden designed by Loutrell Briggs.         It took a few years for Mrs. Whaley to turn the Briggs blueprint into an actual garden, but once she got it growing, she did not neglect it.         Working for several hours a day with her longtime assistant, Junior Robinson, she was a demon for pruning, a necessity in such a small garden with narrow brick walks.         Mrs. Whaley was not sentimental about her plantings. Let a row of Italian cypresses grow too tall for her tastes and whack, they would be gone.         A woman so attuned to the subtleties of nature that she was forever commenting on the weather and could become ecstatic over the feel of a gentle breeze on the back of her neck, Mrs. Whaley, if her book can be trusted, seemed comfortable speaking in epigrams.         A secluded garden bench, for example, was ''a place to invite your soul for a visit.''         For all her love of gardening, it was hardly her only love or her only talent. She also, its seems, had a way with the stove.         In October, Algonquin is bringing out a second Whaley collaboration with Mr. Baldwin, a book of recipes and family stories, ''Mrs. Whaley Entertains.''         Mrs. Whaley, whose husband died in 1987, is survived by three daughters, Emily Whipple, Anne Le Clercq and Martha Adams, all of Charleston, and seven grandchildren.       
         Catherine Kennedy, who after a  long struggle established one of the nation's first nursing centers for AIDS patients, died on Tuesday at her home in New Haven. She was 51.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, family members said.         Not long after moving to New Haven with her family in 1983, Mrs. Kennedy became aware of the lack of nursing centers and services for people with AIDS. Many were turned away by nursing homes. Some were being kept, at enormous expense, at hospitals essentially unequipped to treat them. Others were homeless.         She resolved to open a nursing center for AIDS patients but constantly encountered obstacles. She waged an eight-year struggle against  financial and political obstacles to establish the home. Her experiences, which became a case study for the Harvard Business School, exemplified how someone involved in social entrepreneurship could overcome  great odds.         After two years of research and attempts to raise money, she received a $60,000 grant from the Merck Family Fund. When she sought help from the State Legislature, she encountered indifference and fear of AIDS among the public, as well as hostility from legislators more interested in cutting health-care funds than increasing them.         But she gained the help of Lucie McKinney, the widow of Representative Stewart McKinney, who had died of AIDS, to plead her case with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.         The Governor was persuaded and,  with others, gained passage of a bill to provide special funding for her project that included daily patient costs that were substantially less than full hospitalization and $3 million to renovate an old factory in New Haven.         In 1995, the home opened in the reconverted factory as Leeway Inc.; Mrs. Kennedy ran it until last fall,  when she was forced to resign because of her illness. In that time about 150 patients have been treated.         Catherine Urwin Kennedy was born on Feb. 12, 1947 in Wallsend, England. She received a bachelor of arts in economics and a master's in economic history from the University of East Anglia in England, where she later taught. She also earned a master's degree at Yale's school of management.         She married Paul Kennedy, the author and Yale historian, in 1967.  Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, James and Matthew, of New Haven, and John, of New York, and two brothers and two sisters, all of England.         It was through her affiliation with  Yale that she was able to apply for her patients' participation in the university's experimental research in  AIDS medication and treatment.         Mrs. Kennedy's original goal was to build a home to shelter and care for dying patients. But today, Leeway staff members said, nearly half  of the patients can be sent home with reasonable chances of survival.  Among them was Fred Tyson, who is going back to work as a casting director in Hollywood.         ''She got us involved,'' he said of Catherine Kennedy. ''And I truly believe I would not be alive if it weren't for her.''       
         Chana Timoner, a onetime housewife with such a passionate devotion to tradition and social justice that she became first a rabbi and then the first Jewish woman to serve as a full-time Army chaplain, died on Monday at her home in New Haven. She was 46 and had received a medical discharge earlier this year after developing the Epstein-Barr virus.         Her husband, Dr. Julian Timoner, a chiropractor who persuaded state authorities to release the body without an autopsy, said he believed that his wife had accidentally taken a fatal overdose combination of her prescribed medication and her usual sleeping pills.         Anyone who was surprised when Ms. Timoner, then a self-styled housewife and couch potato, began five years of intense religious training at age 33 or who was surprised even more when she entered the Army and endured six weeks of grueling basic training at age 39, simply had not been paying attention.         For Ms. Timoner, a New Haven native whose father was a railroad carpenter, religion, the military and pushing limits were all family traditions.         Her Russian-born maternal grandfather had been a rabbi in New Haven, and her mother had been so eager to fight the Nazis in World War II that she joined the Canadian Army in 1940, a year before the United States entered the war and she was able to transfer to the newly organized Women's Army Corps.         By the time Ms. Timoner enrolled in Southern Connecticut State College in New Haven, she had developed expansive dreams that included later study at the University of Jerusalem.         Then she made the mistake of dropping by a local Jewish community center one night. Dr. Timoner was there, too, and, well, it's an old story, and by the time she began giving it her own personal twist, Ms. Timoner had been married at 18, had had two children by the time she graduated and had endured a grin-and-bear-it decade as a distinctly restless housewife and mother.         Ms. Timoner, who had always been deeply involved in religion and who had been struggling with herself over whether to become a rabbi, attributed her decision to begin religious studies in 1984 to a friend who told her one day: ''You know, in 7 years you could be a 40-year-old housewife or you could be a 40-year-old rabbi.''         The next day, Ms. Timoner said, ''I was on the phone,'' finding out how to enter rabbinical training.         She enrolled in the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York and spent the next five years making long daily trips to New York City. Then, after her ordination in 1989, she spent two more commuting years studying for a doctorate at the New York Theological Seminary, completing the course work but deferring her dissertation.         Although she was far from the first woman to become a rabbi, most had been affiliated with the liberal Reform Jewish tradition, and as a committed adherent of the more austere Conservative tradition, Rabbi Timoner had trouble finding a post.         Then when she did find one, as rabbi of the Beth El Synagogue in Wallingford, Conn., her career ran afoul of her own principles. When she refused to bend the rules to perform a bar mitzvah for a youth with a Jewish father and a gentile mother without the required religious circumcision ritual, she was forced to step down.         After working for the National Council of Christians and Jews and as a hospital chaplain, Rabbi Timoner joined the Army Reserves and in 1993 became the first Jewish woman to serve as a full-time chaplain in the regular Army.         On the day in 1993 that she began her first assignment, at Fort Bragg, N.C., her husband recalled yesterday, President Clinton announced his ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on homosexuals in the military, prompting Rabbi Timoner to make an announcement of her own: she would gladly provide a full range of counseling for gay soldiers.         The position, which shocked her fellow chaplains at the base, was simply par for the Timoner course. When she had learned that homosexuals, even those with the AIDS virus, were being shunned by the Jewish religious establishment in Connecticut, she formed study groups for Jewish homosexuals and became active in AIDS organizations.         As the only Jewish chaplain at Fort Bragg, Rabbi Timoner held regular Friday services for the few Jewish soldiers at the base, but as the chaplain for a helicopter battalion there she spent most of her time counseling the soldiers, many of them women, none of them Jewish.         After a brief stint in Korea, where the Epstein-Barr virus and the related chronic fatigue syndrome were first diagnosed, Captain Timoner completed her Army service at Fort Benning, Ga., where, as usual, she made waves, especially when she insisted on adding prayers for Catholic, gay and gypsy victims of the Nazi terror at a Holocaust service.         No one should have been surprised. After all, when Elie Wiesel once addressed a large Jewish gathering at Yale and made an impassioned reference to ''the six million,'' Rabbi Timoner, who was sitting on the first row, had felt compelled to stand and chide him for not including the other oppressed groups who died in the gas chambers.         In addition to her husband, Rabbi Timoner is survived by her mother, Mary Surasky of Tampa, Fla.; a daughter, Aviva, of Paris; a son, Samson, of Germantown, Md.; a sister, Abby Sawilowsky, of Oak Park, Mich., and two brothers, Miron Surasky of Oakland, Calif., and Charles Surasky of Yardley, Pa.       
         Mildred Elizabeth Buller Smith, who cut a singular swath through the 20th century by, among other things, picking apples and digging potatoes for the Women's Land Army in World War I, riding herd on New England milk prices for the Office of Price Administration in World War II and becoming a Connecticut television celebrity as a consumer price specialist, died on Aug. 12 at a nursing home in Hartford. She was 99, and it seems almost beside the point to note that she had been an agricultural economist for the University of Connecticut.         To say that Miss Smith followed her own path would hardly do justice to someone who became a farm specialist after growing up on the streets of Chicago.         But Miss Smith, who spent several girlhood summers on a farm, was ever an original, one whose career included driving a hotel jitney in Florida, starting and running the country store for Henry and Clara Ford's Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Mass., and creating and starring in ''Millie's Market Basket'' on Connecticut television.         Never one to be hampered by convention, Miss Smith went to work for the agriculture department of the Connecticut Agricultural College before she received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago; became an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut (as the agricultural college became in 1938)  before she received a master's degree from Radcliffe College, and never did bother to get a doctorate, although she did complete postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics.         For someone born in the Victorian era, Miss Smith adapted well to 20th-century culture, much to the occasional dismay of her mother, a staid woman who had derived her Victorian outlook in situ, growing up in  England, and who was properly shocked when her daughter, who had not come of age in the Roaring Twenties for nothing, would go off for weekends with her young man of the moment.         (Miss Smith, whose romantic life  became a subject of intense speculation among her grandnieces and grandnephews, apparently found a satisfying solution to the problem of juggling job and family: attracting a steady supply of smitten suitors without actually succumbing to matrimony. She derived enormous delight a few years ago when she received a proposal from an admirer at her Hartford retirement community on the very day the Social Security Administration notified her that she had died -- as, it turned out, another Mildred Smith had done.)         Miss Smith's sense of personal mission began early. With three of her four older brothers serving in the military in World War I, she was so eager to do her part that, ignoring her mother's objections, she dropped out of the University of Chicago to enlist in the Women's Land Army, a paramilitary organization that sought to fill the vacuum left by mobilized farm workers.         Typically, Miss Smith, who had a lifelong fascination with statistics, not only picked apples and dug potatoes on a farm in East Corinth, Vt., but counted them, computing yields and other data for reports that she later deposited with the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe.         After the fall harvest one year, the farmer whose land she had worked tried to find her a winter job at a resort that his friend Henry Ford owned in Eustis, Fla., but wondered whether Miss Smith knew how to drive, a requirement for the job of shuttling guests to and from the train station.         In a reply that later delighted her grandnieces and grandnephews, Miss Smith reassured him: ''I've been driving tractors since I was 12.''         Indeed, Miss Smith did so well as a jitney driver that she apparently impressed Ford and his wife, Clara. In 1923, when they bought the inn made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, they recruited Miss Smith to start and run the country store that became a part of the historic restoration and preservation project.         By 1931, Miss Smith had found her life's work in academia, but after a decade as a statistician and consumer price specialist at the University of Connecticut, she decided that it was time to complete her own college education.         So, again flouting convention, she returned to Chicago and received her degree at age 42.         Later, after becoming an assistant professor in 1943 and spending three years with the O.P.A.'s Boston office, she received a master's degree from Radcliffe.         She remained an assistant professor, but her work as a teacher and consumer marketing specialist -- among other things turning out pamphlets and conducting radio and television programs stressing thrift -- was so impressive that when she retired in 1961, she was named professor emeritus.         In retirement Miss Smith wrote historical pamphlets on New England agriculture and taught herself bookbinding, selling leather-bound notebooks and other items at craft fairs to finance her yen for travel, which included 18 trips to England and the Continent, where as a young woman, it should come as no surprise, she had climbed the Matterhorn.       
         The Mexican writer Elena Garro, whose novels, plays and stories exploring the clash between illusion and reality in Latin America made her one of Mexico's most important literary figures behind her former husband, Octavio Paz, died on Saturday at  Cuernavaca Hospital, south of Mexico City.         She was 78 and had emphysema, said her daughter, Helena Paz Garro.         While male voices predominate in Latin American literature, Ms. Garro, through acerbic intelligence and lyric intensity, achieved a level of recognition and importance usually barred to women. The president of the National Council for Culture and the Arts in Mexico, Rafael Tovar y de Teresa, labeled Ms. Garro one of the three most important female writers that Mexico had produced, alongside the 17th-century nun and poet Sor Juana de la Cruz and Rosario Castellanos, Ms. Garro's contemporary.         The Mexican literary world ''is in mourning again,'' said Mr. Tovar y de Teresa. Mr. Paz, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990, died on April 19.         In the Mexico City daily Reforma, the writer Carlos Fuentes called Ms. Garro's first book, ''Recollections of Things to Come,'' ''one of the most important Mexican novels of the 20th century.'' It is one of only a handful of her more than 40 works that was  translated into English.         Ms. Garro was born in the pretty colonial town of Puebla, 75 miles from Mexico City. Her marriage to Mr. Paz in 1937 brought her into a circle of intellectuals where her own radical ideas flourished and eventually clashed with those of her contemporaries.         Soon after marrying, she and Mr. Paz moved from Mexico City to Spain to write about the Spanish Civil War. They lived in Paris after World War II and became part of the literary group that included the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges and the Surrealist Andre Breton. Later they lived in Japan before returning to Mexico.         Their marriage dissolved in the early 1960's and they never spoke to each other again.         In the late 1960's, Mexico, like many other countries, was immersed in protest and rebellion. The Mexican student movement had been fired in part by the country's intellectual elite. But Ms. Garro turned her back on the movement, at one point calling it a ''crazy adventure.''         Her remarks stirred open hostility and brought about an almost complete break with Mexico's literary community. She moved to New York, and later to Paris, remaining in exile for 23 years before returning to Mexico in November 1991.         She found a changed country, which she found hard to accept, and became like a character in ''Recollections of Things to Come'' who tried to step out of time by stopping the clock at the end of every day.         Still, Ms. Garro continued to write provocatively and successfully. This  March, the English translations of two of her novellas, ''First Love'' and ''Look for My Obituary,'' were published by Curbstone.         In a review in The New York Times, Peter Bricklebank said the works possessed ''understated eloquence,'' with characters who are ''prisoners of their own solitude, shackled by social expectations.''         Besides her novels and stories, she  wrote eight works for the theater, including ''A Solid Home'' (1957), ''The Tree'' (1963) and ''Felipe Angeles'' (1979). Upon her return to Mexico in 1991, she was honored for her life's work at the National Theater Program in Aguascalientes.         Ms. Garro spent her last years with her daughter and more than a dozen cats in a two-bedroom apartment in Cuernavaca.       
         Jean Fair Mitchell, a violin-playing, jig-dancing Scottish-born educator who guided the venerable Brearley School for girls from the white-glove 1940's through the armband 1960's without missing a beat, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital near her home in Manhattan. She was 88 and had been the Brearley headmistress from 1947 to 1975.         Brearley, or the Brearley as it tends to be known by those who have trod its halls at 83d Street and the East River, has been a forward-looking New York institution since it was founded in 1884 to provide an education for the intellectually gifted daughters of the New York elite.         And by Miss Mitchell's time, its modern character had largely been set by her redoubtable predecessor, Millicent Carey McIntosh, whose departure in 1947 created the opportunity for a remarkable academic trade, one in which Brearley sent Mrs. McIntosh to Barnard College to become dean (and eventually president) and Barnard dealt Miss Mitchell, a member of its English faculty, to Brearley as headmistress.         For all the high-spirited comment it occasioned, the swap was largely a coincidence. After scrutinizing 75 candidates in a five-month search for Mrs. McIntosh's successor, the Brearley trustees announced that Miss Mitchell had been the board's first choice.         If her first decade or so presented few challenges in an era that is, after all, recalled as the quiescent 1950's, Miss Mitchell, a short, husky woman of verve who declaimed the poetry of Robert Burns in authentic dialect and Scottish burr, wasted little time in putting her own stamp on the school. Brearley had made social history by welcoming Jewish students as early as the 1880's, but Miss Mitchell promptly advanced its commitment to social diversity by recruiting its first black students, an effort aided by a Rockefeller Foundation grant to provide scholarships for needy minority students.         She also left her mark on Brearley students. For a woman who had such an austere public persona that girls would sometimes quake before being sent to her office for discipline, Miss Mitchell proved to be a pussycat in private, a warm and understanding woman who seemed to identify with troublemakers, perhaps because as a schoolgirl she had been one herself.         A native of Kirkcaldy, a Scottish town known less for its heather, she liked to point out, than for a large linoleum factory, Miss Mitchell was apparently such a hell-raiser during her school days that when she became headmistress at Brearley, the headmaster of her former school congratulated her as a ''poacher turned gamekeeper.''         Miss Mitchell, who would sometimes tell horror stories about the corporal punishment girls endured at Scottish schools, came away with such an aversion to punishment of any kind that she became famous at Brearley for her reluctance to suspend even the most recalcitrant troublemakers.         Her identification with the aspirations, frustrations and occasional fractiousness of the young was so complete that when the 1960's brought a wave of youthful unrest and rebelliousness over the Vietnam War, she quietly defused the anger among Brearley students, granting upperclassmen, for example, a day off to participate in an antiwar demonstration.         While Brearley students were as rebellious as any teen-agers in the 1960's, Miss Mitchell tended to be so understanding and accommodating that she left the rabble-rousers with little to complain about. When, for example, students decided that Brearley's infamous blue tunic and skirt uniforms, which they had long complained made them look like pears, were symbols of regimentation and oppression, she allowed students to wear more or less whatever they wanted.         Miss Mitchell, who was credited with strengthening science and mathematics courses, also responded positively to student complaints that the Brearley curriculum was not relevant to modern society. But the changes she authorized, like allowing students to substitute Spanish for German and complete their Latin requirements before high school, did not reach the level of some 1960's academic silliness and left the tough core curriculum unscathed.         Miss Mitchell, who received a master's in English from the University of Edinburgh, trained to be a teacher, spent five years teaching at an Edinburgh girls school, then came to the United States in 1936 as a postgraduate fellow at Smith College. She later joined the Smith faculty and taught at Sarah Lawrence for a year before going to Barnard in 1944.         For all her devotion to education, Miss Mitchell, whose father was an engineer, came close to pursuing a music career. At the time she was offered her first teaching post, he was also offered a job as violinist with the Edinburgh Symphony.         She apparently chose education over music as a career because she knew she could always pursue her love of music on her own, as she did at Brearley, where she would play chamber music with students, and at her summer home (a converted one-room schoolhouse) in Blue Hill, Me., where she was deeply involved with the Kneisel Hall music school.       
         Dorothy Carnegie Rivkin, an author and instructor who developed the Dale Carnegie Training company into a worldwide operation, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 85 and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         Mrs. Carnegie Rivkin, a native of Tulsa, Okla., was chairwoman of Dale Carnegie Training. In the 1940's and 50's she was married to the founder of the company, Dale Carnegie, who wrote the classic American self-help book ''How to Win Friends and Influence People.'' Mrs. Carnegie took control of company operations after Mr. Carnegie's death in 1955 and developed the business into a multinational one with offices in 70 countries, 5 million graduates and $187 million in annual sales.         With her strawberry blond hair, gleaming smile and rich Oklahoma twang -- Mrs. Carnegie was a student of Mr. Carnegie as well as his wife -- she proved as big a success in business as he was in motivational speaking. Though contemporaries in the 1950's wondered whether she had what it took to continue Mr. Carnegie's quintessentially enigmatic enterprise, she scoffed at such skepticism. She told a reporter in 1973 that she immediately took over the operations ''so that I have no time to sit and whittle and spit.''         Even before she met its creator, she had become an early devotee of the Carnegie approach to self-improvement. His book was first published in 1936 and took America by storm with its simple, upbeat message. Even the most retiring people can learn to wow a crowd, he wrote. Look people in the eye, shake hands firmly, flash a winning smile and remember names. Never complain or blame other people.         In the early 1940's, she was Dorothy Price Vanderpool, a divorced mother with a baby daughter to support because of what she called an ''unfortunate teen-aged marriage.'' She took a Carnegie course at a Y.M.C.A. in Tulsa and afterward credited the skills she acquired for the jump she made from stenographer in the Gulf Oil Corporation's accounting department to a senior secretary in the executive suite. She also became president of Tulsa's Young Republicans Club.         Her improvement so impressed Carnegie people that the company offered her a job in New York. She became Mr. Carnegie's secretary in January 1944 and, several months later, his second wife. He later made her his business partner.         Following his style, she collected anecdotes and how-to case histories for a book she wrote, ''How to Help Your Husband Get Ahead in his Social and Business Life,'' published in 1953. Among the homespun advice she offered wives eager to please their husbands were such aphorisms as ''Share his interests and ideals'' and ''Try some intelligent listening. Be a sounding board or a wailing wall.''         But Mrs. Carnegie put business before her personal writing and teaching interests. She once started the Dorothy Carnegie Course, a workshop for women, by women, in contrast to the male-centered Dale Carnegie program. It never took off financially, however, and her business instincts prevailed over her desire to offer a women-only alternative. She did preside over a sharp rise in the number of women taking the regular course.         Her genius was to transform Dale Carnegie Training into a staple of corporate America. She once contended that 400 of the Fortune 500 companies sent employees to study at the company. It became a right of passage for young executives who sought to develop the confidence to present themselves well in public settings. Companies, moreover, paid the enrollment fees, which can now surpass $1,000 for a two-week session.         Graduates were often the best advertisement. The chicken magnate Frank Perdue attended, as did Mary Kay Ash of Mary Kay cosmetics. So did Lee A. Iacocca, the former chief of the Chrysler Corporation.         ''For the first few years of my life I was an introvert, a shrinking violet,'' the sometimes brash auto executive wrote in his autobiography, ''Iacocca.'' ''But that was before I took a course in public speaking at the Dale Carnegie Institute.'' Even the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders spruced up their smiles with the help of Carnegie teachers.         Mrs. Carnegie had a casual working style. She vowed that employees would never find her sitting idly behind a desk. She dictated letters from the porch of her home in Forest Hills Gardens and ran meetings by telephone from her ranch in the Black Hills of Wyoming. She decorated her office with a bronze Philip La Verne conference table, an expensive statement of taste in the late 1960's.         Mrs. Carnegie remarried in 1976, to David Rivkin, also of Tulsa. She retired from active management of the closely held company in 1978 in favor of her son-in-law, J. Oliver Crom, though she remained chairwoman.         She is survived by Mr. Rivkin and her daughter, Donna Dale Carnegie of Lake Oswego, Ore. Another daughter, Rosemary Crom, died earlier. She is also survived by three grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and three stepchildren.       
         Muriel Humphrey Brown, who grew from a shy girl from South Dakota into a confident woman during political campaigns for her first husband, Hubert H. Humphrey, and then was named to fill his seat in the Senate at his death in 1978, died today at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. She was 86 and lived in Plymouth, Minn.         In recent years, Mrs. Brown appeared rarely in public but on Tuesday stood at the side of her son, Hubert Humphrey 3d, Minnesota's Attorney General, when he won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination for governor.         ''Hubert would have been proud,'' she said after her son's victory.         There were many victories in the lives of Hubert and Muriel Humphrey and many setbacks as well. After Humphrey served as Vice President under Lyndon Baines Johnson, he lost to Richard M. Nixon in 1968 when Johnson decided against seeking re-election.         Humphrey had also been defeated for his party's Presidential nomination in 1960 by John F. Kennedy. Muriel Humphrey was at her husband's side for these elections and when he died after returning to the Senate, she was a logical and sentimental choice to succeed him until the 1978 election, when she did not run to keep the seat.         Because of her shyness she had to work at the roles that came to her.         ''If someone had told me what would be happening to me today,'' she said after the Democrats nominated Humphrey for President in 1968, ''well, it would have been an awful thing to have thought of. I just wanted to be a wife.''         Hubert Horatio Humphrey ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the constant campaigner of the constant candidate.         In her roles as the wife of a public figure and in her own brief time in the Senate, Muriel Humphrey supported the social programs that her husband championed. She pressed for the right of a woman to have an abortion and, when her granddaughter Vicky was born mentally disabled, she became involved in work for people with mental disabilities.         In 1988, when President George Bush disparaged liberalism, Muriel Humphrey responded: ''There's something I've been wanting to say for a long time. I'm a liberal and I'm proud of it. In fact, I was probably a little more liberal than Hubert was. I just wanted to say that.''         By then she was Muriel Humphrey Brown, having married Max Brown, a widowed Nebraska businessman who had been a classmate in Huron.         In addition to her husband and her son Hubert 3d, Mrs. Brown is survived by a daughter, Nancy Solomonson, and two other sons, Bob and Douglas, all of suburban Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.

''If someone had told me what would be happening to me today,'' she said after the Democrats nominated Humphrey for President in 1968, ''well, it would have been an awful thing to have thought of. I just wanted to be a wife. I didn't even know how I'd be a mother. I would have been horrified to have thought of this.''         Hubert Horatio Humphrey ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the constant campaigner of the constant candidate.         The Humphreys met in the early 1930's when Muriel was a student at Huron College. They married in 1936, and Mrs. Humphrey worked as a bookkeeper at a utility company to put her husband through college.         In her roles as the wife of a public figure and in her own brief time in the Senate, Muriel Humphrey supported the social programs that her husband championed.

By then she was Muriel Humphrey Brown, having married Max Brown, a widowed Nebraska businessman who had been one of her classmates when she graduated from high school in 1930. At the time, in 1981, Mr. Brown's sister, Dona, said, ''They never dated, but the families kept up with one another.''         In addition to her husband and her son Hubert 3d, Mrs. Brown is survived by a daughter, Nancy Solomonson, and two other sons, Bob and Douglas, all of suburban Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren.       
         Francelia Butler, a late-blooming academic of such passionate, unorthodox ways that she has been credited with almost single-handedly transforming the study of children's literature from a stepchild of library science into a recognized academic discipline, died last Friday at a nursing home in Windham, Conn. A resident of Mansfield Hollow, Conn., she was 85 and had been a professor at the University of Connecticut.         When they hired her in 1965, it's a safe bet that the men who ran the English department at the University of Connecticut knew that Dr. Butler, a native of Cleveland who grew up in Elyria, Ohio, was a 52-year-old widow who had returned to school after her husband's death, received a doctorate in Renaissance literature from the University of Virginia just two years earlier and spent the intervening years teaching at the University of Tennessee.         It's an even safer bet that her Connecticut superiors did not know that in 1934, as a fresh Oberlin College graduate with a degree in the classics, Dr. Butler had gone to Washington to write a pamphlet for  an education association on ''The Brotherhood of Man.'' And that she had been swiftly dismissed from the project after overriding her boss's directive to go easy on Hitler lest she offend association members who agreed with Hitler's policies.         Or that she had been dismissed from her next job, as publicity director of a segregated Washington hotel, after letting black Oberlin alumni attend a banquet there.         Had they been aware of her record of ad hoc social activism, her superiors might have had second thoughts about relegating Dr. Butler, a small woman with a will of steel, to children's literature, a course so scorned by the Connecticut English faculty that it was known derisively as ''kiddie lit.'' Certainly her superiors would not have been as surprised as they were when Dr. Butler, sensing that the academic disdain for children's literature reflected a disdain both for children and for women as children's traditional caretakers and teachers, proceeded to turn the course into a platform for reform.         The faculty's sneers at her course were understandable. Although children's literature had been taught in American universities since the turn of the century, generally as part of the library science or education curriculums, it was a reflection of the subject's lowly standing that it had no academic association and no academic journal.         Dr. Butler swiftly made up for lost time. Among other things, she established the journal Children's Literature, helped to create the children's literature division of the Modern Language Association and served as a founding director of the Children's Literature Association in 1972.         Along the way Dr. Butler's own course became one of the largest and most popular at the University of Connecticut, in part because she turned it into something resembling a three-ring circus with a string of guest lecturers that included falconers, puppeteers, troubadours, Maurice Sendak, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bruno Bettelheim, Dr. Benjamin Spock, Big Bird and the Wicked Witch of the West (the actress Margaret Hamilton).         Some of her colleagues predictably complained that the course's success was based more on showmanship than scholarship, but Dr. Butler, many of whose students went on to to teach children's literature at other colleges, was no slacker as a scholar. She turned out reams of  papers, edited anthologies and in 1989 published ''Skipping Around the World,'' a study of international  jump-rope rhymes.         For all the acclaim she won, Dr. Butler chafed at what she saw as Connecticut's indifference or active opposition to her efforts to wrest children's literature from its vocational moorings and place it within the humanities.         When, by her account, her upstart Journal was actually banned from the University of Connecticut bookstore, Dr. Butler found another academic sponsor: Yale University. (Later, when Connecticut seemed to shun the annual Peace Games Festival she established to teach children conflict resolution through games that rewarded cooperation over competition, she moved it to Harvard.)         Although her male colleagues suggested that the university had been more supportive than she claimed, after her retirement in 1992 at the age of 79, Dr. Butler, who typically had led the campaign that overturned Connecticut's mandatory retirement at 70, transferred her journal and her papers to Hollins College in Virginia.         She is survived by her daughter, Ann Wandell of Windham; a brother, Bruce McWilliams of Little Deer Isle, Me; four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         They were the Thelma and Louise of Nazi Poland, and if Hollywood hasn't tumbled to their story, it may be because Blanca Rosenberg and Maria Rosenbloom had too many hair-raising escapes, too many improbable rescues -- and far too much unremitting horror in between -- for a single script to handle.         Then again, for all the appeal of the wily and intrepid heroines -- the blond, blue-eyed Bronislava, as Mrs. Rosenberg was known, and her brunet sidekick, Maria -- Mrs. Rosenberg's 1993 memoir, which described in rollicking and harrowing detail how the two young women survived the Holocaust while posing as Catholic peasants, left the story unfinished.         While it continues for Dr. Rosenbloom, a retired professor at the Hunter School of Social Work who lives in Manhattan, the story has now ended for Mrs. Rosenberg, and with satisfying flair.         Her death on Sept. 11 at her apartment in Manhattan -- at the age of 85, in her own bed, after a long, peaceful retirement and a distinguished career as an assistant professor at the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work -- was a triumphant flick of her hand, almost six decades coming, to the German soldiers who had arrived in the small city of Kolomyja in eastern Poland (now Ukraine) on July 3, 1941, and tacked up posters that declared in three languages, ''Death to All Jews.''         As Mrs. Rosenberg made clear in her book, ''To Tell at Last'' (University of Illinois Press), it did not take too many aktions in the increasingly depopulated Kolomyja ghetto for it to become apparent that the Nazi regime intended to kill each and every Jew in Poland -- including those, like Mrs. Rosenberg and Dr. Rosenbloom, who had documents identifying them as essential workers at a clothing factory.         At the time of the German invasion, Mrs. Rosenberg, a native of Gorlice who had studied law at the University of Cracow, was the 27-year-old wife of a doctor who had escaped the Nazis by accepting a medical assignment with the retreating Soviet Army, leaving her behind with an infant son, Zygmund, and her adored younger brother, Romek.         Mrs. Rosenberg's son, siblings, parents and other relatives died in the Holocaust, but her husband survived. The couple were divorced after the war, and she promptly married an old flame, Sam Rosenberg, a gynecologist who became a psychiatrist in New York. Dr. Rosenberg died in 1982.         After watching her brother virtually volunteer for death during a mass ''selection,'' Mrs. Rosenberg escaped to the nearby city of Lwow armed with a birth certificate, supplied by her compassionate factory manager, belonging to a Polish Catholic woman who had died.         If she had kept to herself, Mrs. Rosenberg might have had a safer time of it. But she was continually befriending those, like Dr. Rosenbloom, whose appearance increased the likelihood that they would be unmasked.         As a ground-zero account of life on the run, Mrs. Rosenberg's book is filled with crosscuts between cities and a dizzying array of hurried apartment changes, narrow escapes and ruthless shakedowns by police officers, greedy landlords and freelance extortionists.         In one scene, for example, the young women escape through a back window of a military hospital in Lwow, where they had been working, as the police are coming in the front door (they had been betrayed by one of Dr. Rosenbloom's former college classmates who had spotted her in a bookshop). This is swiftly followed by a scene in which they make their way in disguise past wanted posters with their pictures (from their hospital identifications) at the Lwow train station, which is in turn followed by their arrival in Warsaw -- in the midst of the abortive ghetto uprising of April 1943 -- and their immediate arrest on suspicion of being Jews.         The two women spent the last months of the war working for German families in Heidelberg.         Mrs. Rosenberg said that she originally wrote her book in 1948 as a way to deal with the paralyzing guilt she felt as a Holocaust survivor, and that she published it to satisfy her brother Romek's last request that she stay alive to tell the story of the Kolomyja ghetto to the world.         She is survived by twin sons, Alex of Athens, Ga., and Mark of Coimbatore, India, and two grandchildren.       
         Berenice Lipson-Gruzen, a pianist with a long international career, died on Sept. 3 in Bad Wiessee, Germany. She was 73 and lived in New York.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Lipson-Gruzen won notice with her visit to China in 1981, recording the Chopin Second Piano Concerto with the Beijing Central Philharmonic. In New York, she performed at Alice Tully Hall, the 92d Street Y, Merkin Concert Hall and Weill Recital Hall. She taught at Cooper Union, the New School for Social Research, New York University and the City College of New York and gave private lessons.         Ms. Lipson-Gruzen was born in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn. She studied music, anthropology and psychology at Hunter College and made her piano debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1976.         She is survived by her son, Dimitri DeHarak of Montpelier, Vt., and her companion, James Keeler, who produced her recordings.       
         Kathleen Lukens, a more or less ordinary woman whose life had such an ordinary focus on her children it is a wonder how much people made of what she saw as routine maternal devotion, died on Tuesday at her home in Tappan, N.Y. She was 67 and had been executive director of Camp Venture, a Rockland County service organization for the developmentally disabled that she founded in 1969.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         A 1952 Barnard College graduate who taught a year at a private girls' school and worked another year as a police reporter and feature writer for The Bergen Evening Record before marrying and settling into a suburban routine, Mrs. Lukens, who was born in Philadelphia and grew up in northern New Jersey, was typical of a generation of women who put their families before careers.         As a standard P.T.A. mom cum after-school chauffeur with the usual array of committee meetings and volunteer work, Mrs. Lukens, a labor organizer's daughter who was also active in the antinuclear and civil rights movements, did pretty much what any suburban mother of her era did. And if her refrigerator to-do list was a bit longer than most, she did, after all, have five children with varying needs to take care of.         As the children came along, Mrs. Lukens simply dealt with their needs as a matter of routine, feeding them, keeping them clean, nursing them through childhood illnesses and sending them off to school and camp.         It was a routine that varied only in the details. When her fourth son, David, turned out to be autistic, for example, and she discovered there were no camps in Rockland County for children with such developmental disabilities, Mrs. Lukens, who had previously helped start a nursery school for her three older sons, did the obvious thing: She started a camp for David.         She called it Camp Venture, and if at first it was more venture than camp, when it comes to taking care of children, one thing tends to lead to another, and almost before Mrs. Lukens knew it, David had grown up and she had built Camp Venture into a sprawling multiservice organization with an $18 million, largely Medicaid-financed, annual budget that now operates 15 supervised group homes, 4 day service centers and  other programs that serve about 1,000 Rockland County adults and children with an array of developmental disorders, including autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy.         To be sure, Mrs. Lukens, who told David's story in a 1989 novella, ''Song of David,'' had some help, including loving assistance from her husband, Dr. John H. Lukens, a clinical psychologist, from David's four siblings, including his little sister, and from other parents, some of whom moved to Rockland County so they could join Mrs. Lukens's enterprise and their children could benefit from Camp Venture.         Not that it was easy. At a time when the mentally retarded and those with other developmental disabilities were routinely warehoused in indifferent state institutions like the notorious Letchworth Village, to win the required government financing for supervised group homes, Mrs. Lukens had to become a public advocate, buttonholing politicians and organizing campaigns for reform.         Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller was so impressed with her eloquent appeals that he asked her to become a speechwriter. In their turns, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo declared her New York State 1984 woman of the year and named her to his advisory council on mental retardation and developmental disabilities and Gov. George E. Pataki named her to the state Provider Council in 1996.         By then, Mrs. Lukens had received so many honors and heard so much  praise it was a wonder she had any time for her nine grandchildren.         Not surprisingly, perhaps, four of Mrs. Lukens's children grew up to go into some form of social work: her oldest son, Mark, is a minister in East Rockaway, N.Y.; Jonathan of Carmel, N.Y., and her daughter, Margaret Byrne, of Orangeburg, N.Y., are clinical social workers and Daniel, of Congers, N.Y., is his mother's successor as executive director of Camp Venture.         David, now 36, has what his family describes as a happy life, living at a Camp Venture group home in New City, N.Y., and participating in activities at a Camp Venture day services center, all thanks to the efforts of a more or less ordinary woman who saw her duty as making sure her children got the care they needed.       
         Rumer Godden, the prolific British author of ''Black Narcissus'' and  ''The River,'' and a writer of children's books that are enjoyed throughout the world, died on Sunday at her home in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. She was 90.         In a career that began in 1935, Ms. Godden published some 70 novels, children's books, memoirs, biographies and collections of poetry and  stories, many set in India, where she spent her childhood and had her first success as a writer. She also had the experience, rare for most authors, of seeing two of her most widely admired novels, ''Black Narcissus'' and ''The River,'' turned into films that became classics.         Ms. Godden's third novel, ''Black Narcissus'' (1939), first brought her critical attention and commercial success. It told the story of nuns in  the order of the Servants of Mary who try to overcome psychological and physical challenges to establish a hospital and school on a remote, windswept Himalaya mountain. ''Black Narcissus'' was also the first of Ms. Godden's novels to be brought to the screen, in a memorable 1946 film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger that starred Deborah Kerr, David Farrar, Kathleen Byron, Sabu, Jean Simmons and Flora Robson.         Five years later Jean Renoir, the  French director, made ''The River,'' recognized as one of the great color films, an adaptation of Ms. Godden's novel about English children growing up in Bengal. Ms. Godden adapted her novel with Renoir and said that she learned invaluable lessons from him.         ''The River'' and ''Black Narcissus'' bore many of the trademarks of Ms. Godden's work. She was frequently praised for her rich settings and sensitive psychological portraits of children and headstrong, independent women. She was preoccupied with the loss of innocence, the moral problems of childhood and the nature of time. The lyricism and evocative power she often brought to her books sometimes disguised a toughness that addressed dark themes like poverty, jealousy, violence, sexual vulnerability and prejudice.         ''Ms. Godden has a magical skill in conjuring up with a few suggestive details a veritable panorama of Indian life,'' Orville Prescott once observed in The New York Times. ''And she has a wonderful way with fictional children, tender and true and never sentimental.''         In writing about Ms. Godden's  book ''Cromartie v. the God Shiva: Acting Through the Government of India,'' published last year, Bill Vourvoulias wrote in Newsday, ''One of the delights of reading a Rumer Godden novel is the magnetic pull of the exotic settings, affecting readers and characters alike.''         An Autobiography Written at Age 7         Margaret Rumer Godden was born on Dec. 10, 1907, in Sussex, England, the second of four daughters of Arthur Leigh and Katherine Hingley Godden. The family moved to India when she was less than a year old. Her father was a steamship agent and her childhood was spent in remote river towns throughout the British-ruled subcontinent. Until she was 12, Ms. Godden was largely educated by her family in a home that she later described as ''English streaked with Indian, or Indian streaked with English.''         Ms. Godden's precocity was evident during her early days in Bengal, where she wrote a fictional autobiography at age 7, vying with her sister Jon -- who also became a writer -- for the family literary laurels. As she later recalled, ''Part of the bliss of our childhood was that, being most of the year without the normal preoccupations of most girls of our ages, there was all the time in the world to think, avenues of time.''         These years left an indelible, earthy impression of India, quite unlike Kipling's land of the Raj. She evoked this in 1966 in the memoir ''Two Under the Indian Sun,'' which she wrote with Jon: ''The feel of the sunbaked Indian dust between sandals and bare toes; that and the smell. It was the honey smell of the fuzz-buzz flowers of thorn trees in  the sun, and the smell of open drains and urine, of coconut oil on shining black human hair, of mustard cooking oil and the blue smoke from cow dung used as fuel; it was a smell redolent of the sun, more alive and vivid than anything in the West.''         After their untrammeled Indian childhood, Ms. Godden and her sisters were sent to Britain in 1920 to complete their education. The change was shocking and Ms. Godden's time in Britain unhappy and rebellious, she wrote in her memoir ''A Time to Dance, No Time to Weep'' (1988). She bounced among  five schools before finally settling at  Moira House in Eastbourne, where her writing was encouraged. Later she attended ballet school despite a childhood spinal injury and was hooked on dance.         A Love of Dance And of Children         Ms. Godden returned to India in 1925 and opened a dancing school for children in Calcutta three years later, one of the first of its kind in that city. Overcoming social opprobrium, she operated the school for eight years. She considered a career as a choreographer, but in 1934 she married Laurence Sinclair Foster, a charming stockbroker and gambler  whom she later described as a philistine ''who thought Omar Khayyam was a curry.'' Their first child died shortly after birth, at the same time that Ms. Godden's first novel, ''Chinese Puzzle'' (1935), was accepted for publication. Although the couple subsequently had two daughters, their marriage ended in 1941 after Foster joined the army, leaving Ms. Godden with the children and huge gambling debts.         She moved with her children from Calcutta into the mountains of Kashmir, living in an isolated house set amid almond and cherry orchards. She supported her family through writing, teaching the local children, watching over the children of women doing war work in Calcutta, and selling herbal teas. She even survived a crazed cook's attempt to poison her before moving permanently to England in 1945.         Ms. Godden chronicled this time in ''Rungli-Rungliot'' (1943) and ''Bengal Journey'' (1945) and in other novels that addressed the transition from childhood to adolescence against the backdrop of life in colonial India. ''Kingfishers Catch Fire,'' a 1953 novel, concerned a widow and her two children living in Kashmir among people so poor that even a nail is worth stealing. The vicissitudes of time on family history was the theme of several of her novels set in Britain.         In London, in 1949, she married James Haynes-Dixon, a civil servant. Their marriage ushered in a long period of happiness, during which she continued to write, living  in London's Highgate section and in Henry James's Lamb House in Rye. Mr. Haynes-Dixon died in 1975. Ms. Godden is survived by two daughters, Paula Kenilworth and Jane Murray Flutter; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.         Acclaimed Novels That Became Films         Ms. Godden's novel ''The Greengage Summer,'' a critically acclaimed story about the sexual awakening of a teen-age girl in a pre-World War II French village, appeared in 1958; a film based on it called ''Loss of Innocence,'' starring Kenneth More, Danielle Darrieux and Susannah York, was released in 1961. ''The Battle of the Villa Fiorita'' (1963), a novel set in Italy about an adulterous affair seen through the eyes of two children who refuse to allow their mother to leave them and establish a new life, was also made into a film. So was ''In This House of Brede'' (1969), about a sophisticated London businesswoman who becomes a Benedictine nun.         To do research on ''In This House of Brede,'' Ms. Godden lived for three years near Stanbrook Abbey. Her experience with the nuns there contributed to her decision to convert to Roman Catholicism in 1968. In many of her stories and novels, Ms. Godden would write about the rewards and perils of the contemplative life.         Among her other work was ''Mooltiki: Stories and Poems from India'' (1957); ''A House with Four Rooms'' (1989), which takes up where ''A Time to Dance'' ended, and ''The Peacock Spring'' (1975), a novel about a British father and daughter in India who fall in love with Asians.         ''The Doll's House,'' the first and perhaps best known of her nearly two dozen children's books, appeared in 1947. The book told of a family of Dutch dolls owned by two girls in London. Like children, the dolls cannot act independently, but they can feel and wish for rooms of their own and comfortable feather beds. It was followed by many stories that interwove the lives of humans and dolls.         Ms. Godden did not patronize her younger readers and she had decided ideas about how to write for them. ''There are several things children  will not put up with in a book,'' she once observed. ''You have to have a proper beginning and end; you cannot have flashbacks. Then, you can't have a lot of description. And you must be very careful with words. They have to fit the case exactly and be chosen with extreme care.''         Ms. Godden's interest in children's literature also led her to write a biography of Hans Christian Andersen, compile a children's edition of Emily Dickinson's poems and translate two collections of verse by the French poet Carmen Bernos de Gasztold. She was given many prizes for her children's books and was awarded an Order of the British Empire in 1993.         Two years after her husband's death Ms. Godden moved to Scotland to live with her daughter Jane. She continued her routine of writing in the mornings and tending to her Pekingese dogs. She continued to write  widely translated children's books like ''The Little Chair'' (1996) and adult romances like ''Pippa Passes'' (1994), the story of a novice ballerina who falls in love with a gondolier in Venice.         She wrote into her final years and  never forgot India, returning to it in novels like ''Coromandel Sea Change'' (1991). ''To me and my kind,'' she once wrote, ''life itself is a story and we have to tell it in stories -- that's the way it falls. I have told the truth, yet not the whole truth, because that would be impossible.''       
         Anita Kurman Gulkin, president and chief executive of Greenwich House Inc., a social-service and cultural community organization based in Greenwich Village, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59, lived in Springfield, N.J., and also had an apartment in Chelsea in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack during hip surgery last Friday, and she also had cancer, said Paul Racioppi, Greenwich House's chief development officer. She went to work as usual the day before the surgery.         Ms. Gulkin, a former specialist in programs for drug abusers, became Greenwich House's executive director in 1976. Her title was changed to president and chief executive in 1991.         The multifaceted organization has its headquarters at 27 Barrow Street, employs 250 people and also carries on its programs at seven other sites in and near Greenwich Village. In her 22 years as its senior salaried executive, its annual operating budget grew to $13.5 million from $1 million or less, Mr. Racioppi said.         In the years since 1986, Ms. Gulkin set into motion new Greenwich House programs for recovering alcoholics, other substance abusers and people with H.I.V. or AIDS, as well as for providing music and fine-arts classes in public elementary schools, for treating abused children and preventing child abuse and for serving hot meals for elderly Greenwich Villagers to eat together.         She joined Greenwich House's staff as a supervisor of its programs for drug abusers in 1968 and was made director of its substance abuse clinics in 1972.         Over the years, she was also active in other Manhattan social-service organizations. At her death, she was chairwoman of Caring Community, which administers programs for the elderly, mainly in Greenwich Village, and the West Side Association of Community Centers. She was also a co-founder and a former member of the board of what is now called Urban Pathways.         She was inducted into Greenwich Village's Hall of Fame and received the United Way's Big Apple Award.         A native of Newark, she received a bachelor's degree from Pennsylvania State University and later studied social work at Columbia.         She is survived by her husband, Sam Gulkin; a brother, Dr. Martin Kurman of Manhattan, and a sister, Bernice Winarsky of Springfield.       
         If you saw her at all, you'd see her in a cemetery late at night. She'd be clambering about one of those huge cemeteries in Brooklyn and Queens, the ones beneath the flight paths to La Guardia and Kennedy, the ones you can see from certain expressways; the graveyards with comforting names like Evergreen, Mount Neboh and Cypress Hills. She was there on the hottest, stickiest summer night when New Yorkers without air-conditioners couldn't sleep, and she was there when the temperature was below zero and the snow was hip-deep and nobody was awake.         In the moonlight and even when there was no moon, amid the chalk-white and gray polished marble sentries guarding the dead of a great city, Gloria Marie De Martini Stradtner looked only for life in the necropolis.         Mrs. Stradtner, who died on Dec. 22 at the age of 72, looked for stray animals. She looked for the thousands of dogs and cats abandoned every year by people who, having tired of their pets, thought not of bringing them to an animal shelter but of leaving them in a cemetery. Humans may think of cemeteries as woodland-like sanctuaries. But for animals, they are only places to starve to death in the wild.         But Gloria -- as everyone called her -- was determined that this was not to be. Not for her strays.         And so for 50 years or maybe more (nobody can remember when she did not make the rounds of the graveyards at night), she would go forth, lugging large bags of dog food and cat food and big and small traps of the type that cannot hurt animals. She would bait these traps and go back to her car and wait. In an hour or so, she would return to her traps. Sometimes, she would entrap a dozen animals or more in a single night, her prisoners of love. And then she would feed them.         Mrs. Stradtner never had much money, and so to supplement the dog and cat food she bought with her Social Security money she would take jobs working in catering halls, even when she was getting on in years, so she could scoop up the scraps and bring them to her strays in the graveyards. When she was younger, back in the 1950's, she worked as a clerk and data entry specialist for I.B.M. But she did not mind doing menial work in a catering hall. Not if it meant she could feed the animals.         And after she fed them, she would spend the next day making the rounds of veterinarians, imploring their help to neuter the dogs and cats  (they usually charged her reduced fees, which she paid with the money from her modest Social Security check). And then she would visit the shelters, asking them to please take and care for the dogs and cats that New Yorkers did not want.         With her puppies and kittens in tow, she visited shelters outside New York. One was Pegeen Fitzgerald's Last Post Animal Sanctuary all the way up in Litchfield County, Connecticut, near the Massachusetts line. They try to specialize in housing cats there, but when Mrs. Stradtner showed up with dogs from the graveyards of New York, they took in dogs, too.         ''I would estimate she saved thousands of animals,'' said Jeanne Toomey, who runs Last Post. ''She was wonderful. She'd name dogs and cats in the cemetery and she'd bring them up here. Nobody could refuse her.'' She visited animal sanctuaries in Long Island, upstate and in New Jersey, too, and nobody refused her in those places, either.         Sometimes, her friends would go with her on her night visits. Michael Puccino, an executive with a Manhattan computer consulting firm, and his wife, Anne Marie, a veterinary nurse, would help whenever they could. And the cemetery workers helped, too. When it was bitter cold, the workers in at least one cemetery opened the door to a heated mausoleum so the strays could spend the night there. In another cemetery, they built little igloos in the bitterest part of the winter, hoping that Mrs. Stradtner's strays would use them to keep warm.         Mr. Puccino told her more than once that cemeteries are not the safest places to be after dark. But she scoffed at such advice. ''She was the most adventurous, the liveliest individual you'd ever meet,'' Mr. Puccino said. When she was in her 70's, everybody thought she was in her 50's.         Last August, somebody stole her car, which was parked on a Brooklyn street near the house on Chestnut Street where she lived.         ''She called me, and she didn't care about the car,'' Mr. Puccino said. ''She was angry because there were 100 pounds of dog food in the trunk.''         Last summer, there was a dog she was worried about. She called the dog Peekaboo because it peeked around gravestones at her. Peekaboo kept having litters. In one delivery, she had 10 pups. Mrs. Stradtner was determined that Peekaboo be spayed. But Peekaboo was elusive. She would come when Mrs. Stradtner called her name, but no closer than 10 feet. Peekaboo was quite wild, covered with fleas and ticks, and she trusted nobody; life in a cemetery does that to a dog.         One day about six weeks ago, Mrs. Stradtner's speech became slurred. Mr. Puccino spoke to her on the telephone and asked her if she had been drinking. He knew she had not been drinking. She never drank and had not smoked for 20 years.         She stayed with the Puccinos briefly, and Mr. Puccino had her examined at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore. The doctors there said she had cancer. It had started in her lungs and spread to her brain. Then, she moved to Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan; she knew somebody who worked there.         She called Mr. Puccino on Dec. 20, two days before she died. Mr. Puccino said that she wanted to make sure that Peekaboo had been spayed (she was) and that her own two dogs, Lance and Ivy, would be taken care of after she died (he promised her they would be).         The people who knew her and loved her were not sure yesterday about her next of kin. She had been married to a man named Stradtner for three years, maybe 40 years ago. Nobody knew where he was. They had no children. Her sister, Gladys Semino, had predeceased her. Her friends thought, however, that there were cousins.         Somebody found a poem she was believed to have recently written, and at her funeral last Saturday, it was read. It was entitled ''Weep Not'' and began this way:         Do not weep for me when I am gone         For I have friends in the great beyond.         All the little ones I used to feed         Will come to me in my time of need.         They will purr and bark in great delight,         And I will hold and hug them tight.         Oh what a great day that will be         When my furry friends all welcome me.       
         Gyo Fujikawa, a prolific author and illustrator of children's books, including some of the first to feature children of many races, died on Nov. 26 at New York Hospital. She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.         The California-born daughter of a Japanese farmer and an aspiring Japanese social worker, Miss Fujikawa was among the first illustrators to command royalties rather than a flat fee.         Miss Fujikawa's father borrowed her first name from a Chinese emperor (the name rhymes with Leo).         She illustrated five books, including ''Mother Goose'' and ''The Night Before Christmas,'' and wrote and illustrated 45 others. She also designed six United States postage stamps, including the 32-cent yellow rose self-adhesive stamp issued last year and the United States-Japan Treaty centenary stamp of 1960.         Although she retired from writing and illustrating books in 1990, when  her last two books were published, Barnes and Noble booksellers had recently approached her longtime literary agent about reprinting many of the ones that are out of print, said the agent, Bernard Kurman. The first two books she both wrote and illustrated, ''Babies'' and ''Baby Animals,'' have sold a combined 1.3 million copies and are still in print.         ''If you notice,'' Miss Fujikawa wrote a few years ago, ''in all my books (except for the fairy-tale books) there are very few grown-ups. I try to draw children in such a way that they convey the emotion or the action or whatever it is that I'm talking about.''         Born in Berkeley, Calif., in 1908, Miss Fujikawa studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles before and after spending 1932 in Japan, where she developed a love of Japanese art and a stronger appreciation of her heritage. Back home, she did promotional work on the movie ''Fantasia'' for Disney Studios, which later sent her to its advertising department in New York, where she designed many 25-cent Disney books.         After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, Mrs. Fujikawa's family was interned in Arkansas in a relocation camp.         During the war Miss Fujikawa did movie and pharmaceutical advertising layouts and magazine illustrations.         After she did a composite of Disney characters for McCall's magazine, Doris Dunewald, an editor at Grosset & Dunlap, asked her to illustrate a new edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's ''A Child's Garden of Verses,'' which was published in 1953. A few years later Ms. Dunewald proposed that she write the text as well as illustrate the two books that became ''Babies'' and ''Baby Animals.'' After that Miss Fujikawa was to write and illustrate most of her books, including the last two, ''See What I Can Be!'' (Putnam, 1990) and ''Good Night, Sleep Tight, Shhh. . .'' (Random House, 1990).         Although she was engaged for a few years beginning at the age of 19, Miss Fujikawa never married. In her autobiographical sketch, written in her later years, she said, ''I am flattered when people ask me how I know so much about how children think and feel. Although I have never had children of my own, and cannot say I had a particularly marvelous childhood, perhaps I can say I am still like a child myself. Part of me, I guess, never grew up.''
