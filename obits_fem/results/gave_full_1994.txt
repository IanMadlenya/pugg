         Dixy Lee Ray, former chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Governor of Washington, died yesterday at her home on Fox Island, near Tacoma. She was 79.         She had suffered for some months from a severe bronchial condition, said a friend, Lou Guzzo, who is a television commentator.         Dr. Ray, a marine biologist who championed the nuclear industry, was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to the atomic commission in 1972, and served as chairwoman from 1973 to 1975. During her tenure, she raised eyebrows in the nation's capital by living in a mobile home and taking her dogs to the office.         In 1974, she underscored the finding of an Atomic Energy Commission study of nuclear power plant safety: that the chance of mass destruction from a reactor accident was as unlikely as that of a meteor striking an urban area. "There is no question that the nuclear industry comes off very well," she said.         She issued her latest no-nonsense commentary on nuclear issues on Thursday, when she dismissed reports about cold-war-era Federal radiation experiments as alarmist.         "Everybody is exposed to radiation," Dr. Ray was quoted by The Associated Press as saying, adding, "A little bit more or a little bit less is of no consequence." Criticizing Kissinger         The Atomic Energy Commission was eventually abolished and its duties were transferred to the new Energy Research and Development Administration. Dr. Ray was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 as Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans, International Environment and Scientific Affairs.         She resigned from the post later that year, contending that Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger had ignored her office on policy matters.         It was as a Democrat that Dr. Ray was elected in 1976 to one term as the only female Governor her state has had, becoming the nation's second woman to be elected Governor without succeeding her husband. Ella T. Grasso, a Democrat, had been elected Governor of Connecticut two years before.         Dr. Ray, after her surprise victory, said that she supported the Equal Rights Amendment but that women should "stop brooding about being a woman." She told women, "If you want to do something, then train yourself and you've got to be willing to work."         Governor Ray a conservative in fiscal matters and was praised by a lobbyist in the aircraft industry as "the best friend business ever had."         She also angered environmentalists with her support of nuclear power, unhampered growth and oil supertankers.         But she could also be stern in the environmental sphere. In 1979, she ordered the low-level nuclear waste dump at a Federal reservation in Hanford, Wash., one of only three in the nation, closed temporarily after inspectors had found that some radioactive material was being hauled in unsafe trucks.         In 1980, Dr. Ray herself faced a environmental problem when Mount St. Helens repeatedly erupted, ravaging parts of the state with volcanic mud flows, flooding and ash.         While Dr. Ray was Governor, the power of her intellect and her skill as a speaker gave her an aura of great competence. But she was sharp-tongued, highly unconventional for a politician in high office, and became entangled in disputes with reporters and with other public officials.         Dr. Ray was also burdened by disaffection in her own party going into the 1980 Democratic primary and suffered a startling defeat at the hands of State Senator Jim McDermott, who offered himself as "a Governor who listens."         She was christened Margaret at her birth in 1914 in Tacoma, but she later chose the name Dixy Lee. She climbed Mount Rainier, her state's tallest peak, at age 12 -- becoming the youngest girl to do so -- and went on to graduate in 1937 from Mills College, where she also earned a master's degree. She received a doctorate in zoology from Stanford in 1945.         She taught at schools in Oakland, Calif., from 1938 to 1942 and was an associate professor of zoology at the University of Washington from 1945 to 1976.         With Mr. Guzzo she wrote two books: "Trashing the Planet: How Science Can Help Us Deal With Acid Rain, Depletion of the Ozone, and Nuclear Waste (Among Other Things)," published in 1990, and "Environmental Overkill," published this year.         She is survived by her sisters, Marion Reid of Fox Island, Dr. Jean Ray of Long Beach, Calif., Julianna Strong of Salem, Ore., and Elvista Steele of Klatskanie, Ore.       
         Joan Avnet, an art collector, dealer and philanthropist, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter Rosalind Avnet Lazarus.         Mrs. Avnet was the widow of Lester Avnet, founder of Avnet Inc., a distributor of electronics components. As collectors, the Avnets focused primarily on Old Master and Modern drawings, assembling major holdings in 20th-century drawings by European and American artists. Of the 900 works they acquired between 1960 and Mr. Avnet's death in 1970, 180 drawings were donated to the Museum of Modern Art in 1978.         Formed in consultation with the museum, the gift collection came to include theatrical drawings by Jim Dine, early drawings by Picasso and others by Jean Dubuffet, Lionel Feininger, Jackson Pollock, Emil Nolde, Egon Schiele and Leon Bakst. They also gave the museum drawings by Balthus, Chagall, Matisse, Modigliani and Rouault.  Other Gifts         The Avnets also made gifts to the Institute of Molecular Biology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Joan and Lester Avnet Division of Laboratories at the North Shore University Hospital and the Joan and Lester Avnet Chair in Ethics at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         In the 1960's Mrs. Avnet owned a gallery in Great Neck, L.I., and later was a private art dealer in New York and Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Avnet was born in New York and attended Hunter College. Her second marriage, to Dr. Karl Fischbach, ended in divorce.         In addition to Mrs. Lazarus, of New York and Washington, she is survived by another daughter, Carole Avnet Rocherolle of Stamford, Conn.; a son, Jonathan Avnet, a film director and producer of Topanga Canyon, outside Los Angeles, and eight grandchildren.       
         Rosemary Glyde, a violist who performed frequently as a recitalist and was a founder and president of the New York Viola Society, died on Tuesday at the Northern Westchester Medical Center in Mount Kisco. She was 46 and lived in Golden's Bridge, N.Y.         The cause was cancer, said Joan Ryan, her publicity agent.         Ms. Glyde was born in Auburn, Ala., and studied with Lillian Fuchs and Dorothy Delay at the Juilliard School, where she received a doctorate. She made her New York debut in 1973, after winning first prize in the Juilliard Viola Competition.         Ms. Glyde devoted considerable energy to expanding the comparatively small repertory for solo viola. She transcribed the Bach Cello Suites and the Rachmaninoff Cello Sonata for her instrument, and she composed several works, including a Fantasia for Solo Viola and a Suite for Four Violas. Her repertory also included many contemporary works, and she gave the premieres of works composed for her by Richard Lane, Bernard Hoffer and Judith Shatin.         She is survived by her husband, William Salchow, and a daughter, Allison Shumsky, both of Golden's Bridge, and two sisters, Rosemary Glyde of Boulder, Colo., and Wendy Klopfenstein of Mobile, Ala.         Correction:  January 22, 1994, Saturday         An obituary on Thursday about Rosemary Glyde, a violist and composer, misstated the given name of a surviving sister. She is Judith Glyde.       
         Mary Woodard Lasker, the philanthropist and champion of medical research and urban beautification, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 93 years old and also had an apartment on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said her nephew, James W. Fordyce. She made her last public appearance at a luncheon at the Pierre Hotel in October.         As a patron and volunteer lobbyist, Mrs. Lasker furthered medical research on cancer, heart and eye diseases and in other fields. She also lent her support to beautification projects in New York and Washington that included planting trees and flowers and providing fountains and lighting. And she was a noted hostess and art collector.         In her later years she reduced her activities, but at her death she was still president of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, honorary president of the American Cancer Society and a trustee and vice chairman of the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Education Foundation.         In a 1958 speech, Robert Moses, then the Parks Commissioner, said Mrs. Lasker possessed "the irresistible combination Madison Avenue dreams of -- the blend of many essences in the beautiful package."         "Intelligence, vision, generosity, charm, kindness -- Mary has them all," Moses continued. Co-Founded Lasker Awards         Mrs. Lasker and her husband Albert Davis Lasker, a pioneer advertising executive who died in 1952, established the Lasker Foundation in 1942. In almost every year since 1944, it has given Albert Lasker Awards, largely for outstanding contributions to clinical and basic medical research.         The foundation has often been quick to recognize significant new research, and its awards have great prestige. Besides supporting medical research and health programs, it has also given its backing to efforts to beautify New York and to activities in the arts.         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served variously as chairman of the board of the American Cancer Society, a trustee of Research to Prevent Blindness and of the Cancer Research Institute and a director of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. She was also active in other similar organizations.         "I am opposed to heart attacks and cancer and strokes," she used to say, "the way I am opposed to sin."         In addition, Mrs. Lasker strove to persuade Federal, state and city officials and legislators to provide more funds for medical research on major killing and crippling diseases. She worked to persuade Congress to increase appropriations for the National Institutes of Health and to set up additional research centers concentrating on specific diseases.         "Without money," she said in 1985, "nothing gets done." To make sure things got done, she used to visit the White House (during Democratic Administrations, she added wryly). She also paid calls on Washington legislators, corresponded with Presidents and arranged for scientists to meet Government leaders. 'I Couldn't Cut Up a Frog'         Despite her successes in furthering medical research, Mrs. Lasker used to contend that she lacked scientific and medical aptitude. "Nobody would have me in their laboratory for five minutes," she once said, also with a smile. "I couldn't cut up a frog, and I certainly couldn't perform surgery. I'm better at making it possible for other people."         Her passionate interest in medicine was fueled partly by illnesses of people around her and by her own health; she repeatedly had ear infections during her Wisconsin childhood. Laskers Lead to Nobels         Over the years, the Lasker Foundation helped shape medical history by recognizing and supporting promising research, and it has repeatedly singled out future winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Fifty-one Lasker winners have become Nobel laureates.         For instance, the foundation's prize jury, whose longtime chairman is the heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chose two winners of 1985 Albert Lasker Medical Research and Public Service awards -- Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas, for their studies of cholesterol chemistry in relation to the clogging of coronary arteries. They were also named Nobel Prize laureates that year.         Commenting on Mrs. Lasker's efforts, Dr. DeBakey said in a 1985 interview: "Mary Lasker is an institution unto herself. Asking what her importance has been is like asking what Harvard has meant to this country."         Throughout their history, Lasker awards have been given in every year except 1960, 1990 and 1992. In early 1990, when it was announced that no awards would be given that year, the foundation had assets of about $2.4 million, down from about $4.5 million in 1980, but an executive of the foundation said that omitting the awards, of $15,000 each, in that year "wasn't really a financial decision." Since then, the awards have been increased to $25,000 each. 'Annie Appleseed'         Like her passion for medical research, Mrs. Lasker's interest in and patronage of urban beautification was long standing. In a 1953 column in The New York Times, Meyer Berger referred to her affectionately as "Annie Appleseed."         Her beautification activities included furnishing funds for tulips, daffodils, begonias, chrysanthemums and other flowers at various locations in New York. Her other urban beautification projects ranged from lighted Christmas trees to 300 Japanese cherry trees donated to the United Nations.         Mrs. Lasker acquired her interest in parks and gardens during her girlhood in Watertown, Wis., where she was born to Frank Elwin Woodard, a banker, and Sara Johnson Woodard, who was a founder of two parks there.         She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1923 and studied briefly at Oxford. Then she went to work for the Reinhardt Galleries, in Manhattan, where her duties were, as she later put it, "arranging benefit loan exhibitions of outstanding old and modern French masters and selling pictures to collectors and museums." An Art Collector         She also went on buying trips abroad and began building an art collection of her own, which included works by Miro and Renoir. She sold most of the collection years later when she changed Manhattan homes, partly, as she said, "because I wanted to be able to give away the money."         In 1940, after leaving the art-gallery world, she married Mr. Lasker, who had achieved wealth and eminence as an advertising executive, having joined the Lord & Thomas advertising agency in 1898 and become its owner in 1908.         Two years later, he retired from active business and the Lasker Foundation was set up. In addition, drawing on his own experience in public affairs, he encouraged Mrs. Lasker to press Washington to provide more funds for research in medicine. In the decades that followed, her efforts in that direction bore many fruits.         One notable success was the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. "The N.I.H. has flowered," Dr. DeBakey recalled in the 1985 interview, "because in many ways she gave birth to it and nursed it. It was in existence, but it was she who got the funding for it."         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served on the boards of trustees or directors of a number of organizations and institutions, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Museum of Modern Art, the Norton Simon Museum, New York University and Braniff Airways. Won Presidential Medal         She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1989, and other honors. A Health Sciences professorship at the Harvard School of Public Health was named for her in 1989, and a new variety of pink tulip was named for her in 1985.         Mrs. Lasker's first marriage, in 1926 to Paul Reinhardt, the owner of the Reinhardt Galleries, ended in divorce in 1934.         Her sister, Alice Fordyce, was the executive vice president of the foundation and director of the Lasker Awards program. She died in 1992.         In addition to her nephew, Mr. Fordyce of Greenwich, who is a trustee of the foundation, Mrs. Lasker is survived by a stepdaughter, Frances Lasker Brody of Los Angeles; a stepson, Edward Lasker of Los Angeles; three great-nephews; five step-grandchildren, one of whom, Christopher W. Brody of Manhattan, is also a trustee of the foundation, and two step great-grandchildren.         Funeral rites and burial are to be private. A memorial service is to be held in the spring.       
         Raquel Adonaylo, a soprano who was on the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, died on Tuesday at her home in Rosemont, Pa. She was 67.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Rony Rogoff, a family friend.         An accomplished pianist, Miss Adonaylo gave recitals and appeared with orchestras in her native Uruguay before devoting herself to her singing career. She studied voice in France in the early 1950's and later performed in recitals, in chamber concerts and as a soloist with orchestras. She sang many major roles in operas produced by Uruguay's Symphony Orchestra.         In 1960, she was invited to perform the premiere of Ginastera's "Cantata para America Magica" in Washington, a work she later recorded for Columbia Records. In 1963 she moved from Uruguay to Israel, where she sang with the Israel Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein, Zubin Mehta and other conductors. She was also a regular participant at the Marlboro Music School and Festival in Vermont and toured with Musicians From Marlboro. In 1975 she moved to the United States and joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute, where she taught until 1989.         She is survived by her husband, Jacko Peniazek; a daughter, Ana, and two sons, Pablo and Eduard, all of Rosemont.       
         Melina Mercouri, the vivacious actress with a husky laugh who went on to become Greece's Minister of Culture, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Miss Mercouri, whose greatest screen success was her role as a flamboyant prostitute in the 1960 film "Never on Sunday," was 68, her family said, although references disagree on the year of her birth.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia Turi, a hospital spokeswoman. Miss Mercouri was hospitalized in early February and underwent surgery on Feb. 23 to remove cancerous tissue, but her conditioned deteriorated on Saturday because of an infection, Ms. Turi said.         Coming from a politically prominent family, the actress was a passionate anti-Fascist who lost her citizenship and property in 1967 for her aggressive opposition to the junta that held power in Athens for seven years, until 1974. She then speedily returned home and entered politics, winning election to Parliament in 1977 as a Socialist. Miss Mercouri was appointed Culture Minister in 1981 after the Socialists won a landslide victory. She served in the post until 1989, when her party lost power, and then returned when the party was re-elected in October.         "Never on Sunday," the story of a nurturing trollop who refused to work more than six nights a week, established Miss Mercouri as an international star. The movie was directed by Jules Dassin, her close companion and later her husband. Mr. Dassin, the son of a New York barber, fled to Europe after being blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1950's.         Mr. Dassin directed, and often wrote and produced, most of Miss Mercouri's nearly 20 other movies, including "He Who Must Die" (1957), about life overtaking a Passion play in a primitive village on Crete; Mr. Dassin co-adapted the story from the novel "The Greek Passion," by Nikos Kazantzakis. Other joint efforts included "Phaedra," a 1961 tale of a woman lusting for her stepson, and "A Dream of Passion," a 1978 variation of Medea's child-murders. Both were based on, or inspired by, ancient Greek dramas.         Their other team efforts included "Topkapi," a well-regarded 1964 museum-theft caper; "10:30 P.M. Summer," a 1966 story of a descent into alcoholism, and "Promise at Dawn" (1970), from a memoir by Romain Gary about his unconventional mother.         Miss Mercouri conquered Broadway in a 1967 musical adaptation of "Never on Sunday" titled "Illya Darling," prompting Walter Kerr of The New York Times to hail her as "a creature you'd be happy to take home to mother, if mother was out." Politics and Pacifism         The outspoken actress and politician with a flashing smile and feline movements was a favorite of interviewers, who called her a charming, forceful and quotable woman very much in love with life. She spoke French, German and English, as well as Greek.         Of her return from exile, she remarked in 1988: "It became impossible not to interfere in politics. When you are born Greek, you are always in a state of alert about social things." She was also a pacifist, declaring in her 1971 autobiography, "I Was Born Greek," that the "quickest way to get disarmament is if John and Jean and Ivan refuse to pay one penny's tax" for weapons.         Asked about feminism, she replied: "I have never been discriminated against. I have made my life as a woman, and that's not bad." Of marriage, she remarked: "If you take a European woman's husband, she has nothing. But if you take an American husband, you make the wife rich." As for love, she commented: "All any woman wants is to sleep with a man. It is simple. Life is simple."         Maria Amalia Mercouri was born in Athens on Oct. 18, 1925, the daughter of a longtime Minister of the Interior and the granddaughter of a much-admired, longtime Mayor of Athens, who nicknamed her Melina, meaning honey, the usual color of her hair in later years.         Her family's home was open to people from all classes, from scholars to beggars, and meals were shared by up to 100 guests. The wide-ranging contacts and conviviality made her an egalitarian and gave her a liberal education while she resolved to be an actress.         Her parents opposed her acting, so, at 17, she eloped with Panayiotis Characopos, an elderly, wealthy Athenian sympathetic to her study of classical Greek tragedy at the National Theater Academy. After three years of preparation, she went on the Athens stage, won increasingly big parts and was acclaimed in the leading roles in "Mourning Becomes Electra" and "A Streetcar Named Desire." She also starred on the Paris stage and made her film debut as a doomed cabaret entertainer in "Stella," a 1955 melodrama directed by Michael Cacoyannis.         A major turning point occurred at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival, where she met Mr. Dassin. Though married to others, they immediately forged a deep personal and professional partnership. They were married a decade later.         Miss Mercouri was widely praised for her Madonna-prostitute role in "He Who Must Die" and, three years later, for her hedonistic prostitute in "Never on Sunday," for which she won an award as best actress at Cannes and an Academy Award nomination.         Her other films included "The Gypsy and the Gentleman" (1958), "Where the Hot Wind Blows" (1959), "The Victors" (1963), "A Man Could Get Killed" (1966), "Gaily Gaily" (1969) and "Nasty Habits" (1976). Reviewers repeatedly hailed her performances as exuberant, but sometimes extravagant and overwrought.         In her political career, she represented the working-class district of Piraeus, the port of Athens, which had been the setting for "Never on Sunday." She kept an office there, meeting with constituents twice a week and discussing problems dealing with Government services and women's issues. "I like myself better now," she said in 1978. "It feels better to care about other people's interests -- to be involved."         Through the 1980's, Miss Mercouri often made headlines because of her obsessive effort to regain for Greece the Elgin Marbles of the Acropolis. The sculptures were bought from the Turkish ruler of Greece in the early 1800's by a British ambassador, Lord Elgin, and later placed in the British Museum. As Minister of Culture, she also strove to revive classical Greek culture by increasing Government subsidies for the arts, building provincial libraries and pressing for the preservation of historic monuments.         In exile, Miss Mercouri and her husband lived mainly in Paris. In later years, their main home was in Athens, and they had a vacation home on the Greek island of Spetsai.         She is survived by her husband and by a brother, Spiros Mercouris.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Anni Albers, a leading textile artist of the 20th century, died yesterday at her home in Orange, Conn., near New Haven. She was the widow of the abstract artist Josef Albers and was 94 years old.         Mrs. Albers was cured of lymphoma 20 years ago and died of old age, said Dr. Samuel Bobrow, her physician.         "From her earliest days as a student and master at the Bauhaus in the 1920's, Anni Albers was an explorer and form giver in textiles," said Jack Lenor Larsen, the New York designer and textile producer. "And in America, she continued in her role as a prophet, teacher and innovative weaver."  A Reluctant Weaver         Mrs. Albers was the last surviving teacher at the Bauhaus, the German design school founded at Weimar in 1919, and closed by the Nazis in 1933. When she enrolled as a student at the Bauhaus in 1922, she hoped to study wall painting but became a weaver reluctantly, when no other workshop was available.         After she received her diploma in 1930, Mrs. Albers and her husband, whom she had met at the Bauhaus and married in 1925, stayed on as teachers, he in design, she as a part-time instructor in textiles and as the acting director of the weaving workshop. When the Bauhaus moved to Berlin in 1932, they moved with it, and Josef Albers continued teaching while Mrs. Albers worked privately as a weaver.         In 1933, after the Gestapo had padlocked the doors of the Bauhaus, Mrs. Albers met the architect Philip Johnson, then at the Museum of Modern Art, who was visiting Berlin and asked her if she and her husband wished to come to the United States. On his return to New York, he spoke with Edward Warburg, the art patron, who was assisting the founders of the Black Mountain College in North Carolina, a progressive school of the arts.  A Solo Exhibition         Though they spoke no English, and did not know where North Carolina was, the Alberses went. From 1933 to 1939, she was an assistant professor of art at Black Mountain. In 1949, she became the first weaver to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, the museum which owns the finest collection of her works.         Mrs. Albers's textiles reflected the Abstract style in painting in their geometric patterns and complex weaves. She used knotting and intertwining of linked threads to enrich the texture of her works. She also designed fabrics for Knoll International. Her 1926 designs for rugs are now being produced by Larsen Carpet. And her 1950's books, "On Weaving" and "On Designing," are considered a must for enthusiasts and students of design.         When she was 70, Mrs. Albers gave up weaving and became a printmaker, at which she was prolific for more than a decade. She produced many editions for Tamarind Lithography Workshop and Gemini G.E.L., both of Los Angeles, and Tyler Graphics of Mount Kisco, N.Y.  A Cameo Role         In her 80's, she made her debut in films in 1984, playing a cameo role looking at unedited film, in Maximilian Schell's "Marlene."         Born in Berlin and named Annelise Fleischmann, she was the daughter of a prosperous furniture manufacturer. Mrs. Albers began her art studies as a teen-ager studying drawing and painting with Martin Brandenburg, an impressionist painter. She also attended the School of Applied Art in Hamburg before going to the Bauhaus.         She is survived by her brother, Hans Farman of Old Greenwich, Conn.       
         Elizabeth Nitze Paepcke, who played a central role in transforming Aspen, Colo., from a largely abandoned 19th-century mining town into a winter resort, died on Wednesday at her home in Aspen. She was 91.         She died of complications from a head injury she suffered in a fall last weekend, her family said.         Mrs. Paepcke (pronounced PEP-keh) collaborated with -- and often inspired -- her husband, Walter, a Chicago industrialist, in the development of what was nearly a ghost town by the 1940's. Mr. Paepcke bought about half the town, then proceeded to rebuild it.         The Paepckes helped open the International Design Conference in Aspen, the Aspen Music Festival and the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. Mrs. Paepcke also founded the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies. Goethe Festival in 1949         Modern Aspen was put on the cultural map in 1949 when Mr. Paepcke engaged the Budapest String Quartet for a concert to celebrate his wife's birthday. This led to the Goethe Bicentennial Festival, also in 1949, with Albert Schweitzer, the theologian, musician and medical missionary in Africa, making his only visit to the United States to address the festival at Mrs. Paepcke's suggestion.         "In most ways Aspen is Elizabeth Paepcke," said David McLaughlin, president of the Aspen Institute, which holds seminars for leaders from various fields in the United States and overseas. "She and Walter created the institutions that gave vision and vitality to the community."         Mrs. Paepcke was born in Baltimore and as a young woman worked as an interior designer in Chicago. She first saw Aspen while on a skiing vacation in 1938, when it had no amenities like ski runs or lifts.         Once a rich silver-mining town with a population of 15,000, Aspen was largely dilapidated in the 1930's, but its natural setting and faded charm caused her to return in 1946 with her husband.         Aspen, in west-central Colorado just west of the Sawatch Range of the Rocky Mountains, now has a year-round population of about 5,000. In recent years, Mrs. Paepcke expressed some disenchantment with the direction Aspen's "renaissance" had taken, with its emphasis on wealth and celebrity and its proliferation of boutiques and ski resorts.         Mr. Paepcke, who headed the Container Corporation of America, died in 1960 at the age of 63.         Mrs. Paepcke is survived by three daughters, Anina Hamilton of Sussex, England, Paula Zurcher of Woodside, Calif., and Antonia DuBrul of Manhattan; a brother, Paul H. Nitze of Washington, the longtime United States arms negotiator who is now retired; eight grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters.       
         The Rev. Beatrice Blair, associate priest at St. George's Episcopal Church on East 16th Street, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in the East Village.         The cause was a heart attack, her husband, John Robbins, said.         Her ordination in 1978 put her among the first female priests in the Episcopal Church. She had served at St. George's for the last four years, after assignments at the Church of the Heavenly Rest and St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery. Scion of Blair House Family         A native of Boston, Ms. Blair was raised in Washington, a scion of the family that gave Blair House to the United States Government, which turned it into a residence for dignitaries visiting Washington as guests of the White House. She attended Bryn Mawr College but graduated from the Manhattan branch of Empire State College, and trained for the priesthood at the General Theological Seminary, in Manhattan.         Before moving to New York from Rochester, she was a president of the Monroe County League of Planned Parenthood and the founding president of Eleanor's List, a group formed to raise funds for female candidates who support abortion rights. In the early 1970's, she was also executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.         More recently, she was a leader in the New York Metropolitan Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights.         Besides her husband, Ms. Blair is survived by a daughter and three sons from a previous marriage: Elizabeth Hillard of Pleasant Hill, Calif., Harper Sibley Jr. of Portland, Me., Blair Sibley of Miami, and Durbin Sibley of Corpus Christi, Tex.; three sisters, Judy Green of Cincinnati, Betsy Douglas of Missoula, Mont., and Edith Blair of Alexandria, Va., and nine grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Collins, a singing star of the popular 1950's television show "Your Hit Parade" and a Tony nominee for the Broadway show "Follies" in 1971, died on Thursday at her home in Watervliet, N.Y. She was 67.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Melissa Holgate.         As a featured singer on "Your Hit Parade" from 1950 to 1957, Miss Collins was America's singing sweetheart, noted for her trademark high-necked blouses and such standard songs as "Too Young," "Shrimp Boats" and "Harbor Lights." The show was the television version of the long-running radio program "Lucky Strike Hit Parade" and featured the top tunes of the week performed by the show's cast in a variety of costumes and settings. Other members of the cast during Miss Collins's time included Snooky Lanson, Gisele MacKenzie, June Valli and Russell Arms.         Miss Collins, whose original name was Marjorie Chandler, was born on Nov. 18, 1926 in Windsor, Ontario. Her first career thoughts were for secretarial work, but when her parents entered her in a talent show in 1938, she won a wristwatch and a chance to sing on a children's radio program in nearby Detroit. She was such a hit that she stayed with the show for some time. Met Her Mentor at 16         In 1942, she was introduced to the band leader Raymond Scott, who advised her to take voice lessons for a year and then to sing for him again. She subsequently sang with his quintet and performed in jazz spots across the country. In 1949, Mr. Scott left his group to become director of the orchestra for the radio show "Your Hit Parade," and Miss Collins stayed on the road and ran the quintet. That meant doing the introductions as well as singing. Speaking Mr. Scott's lines, she was actually doing her first announcing.         "It was quite a terrifying experience," she said in a 1953 interview, but it took her closer to the earnest commercials that were to contribute to her fame.         She and Mr. Scott were married in 1952.         Early in 1950, the American Tobacco Company, sponsor of "Your Hit Parade" for Lucky Strike cigarettes, was looking for a new type of advertising commercial. Mr. Scott was commissioned to write some jingles, which eventually gained nationwide popularity, and he had Miss Collins sing them. The sponsor liked her voice and personal appearance and when televising "Your Hit Parade" was broached, she was selected for four trial telecasts. Impressed by this cheerful woman who told people to get happy by smoking a particular cigarette, the sponsor signed her to do the commercials and to be a featured singer when the show began its official run in October 1950. Letters From the Clergy         In a 1979 interview, Miss Collins was asked if she liked her girl-next-door image.         "Yes, because that's me, and you can't be what you aren't," she replied. "I was very protected when I was growing up, and there's a lot that I don't know. When I was on 'Hit Parade,' the bulk of my mail was from priests and nuns. They used to do sermons on all the good I was doing for American womanhood."         After "Your Hit Parade" went off the air, she did a stint on "'Candid Camera," from 1961 to 1963. In 1971 she was given a starring role in the Stephen Sondheim musical "Follies," singing one of the show's big songs, "Losing My Mind" and receiving a Tony nomination for her performance. She also had leading roles in stock companies and dinner-theater productions and gave concerts across the country. Plagued with asthma for years, she retired from performing in 1980.         She was also active for many years in the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and became a vice president of the organization in 1988.         Her two marriages, to Mr. Scott and to the singer Ron Holgate, ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Holgate, who lives in Watervliet, she is survived by two other daughters, Elizabeth Adams, also of Watervliet, and Deborah Studebaker of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.       
         Rildia Bee O'Bryan Cliburn, the mother of Van Cliburn and his only piano teacher until he was 17, died yesterday at All Saints Episcopal Hospital in Fort Worth. She was 97 and lived in Fort Worth.         The cause was a stroke that occurred last Thursday, said Mary Lou Falcone, Mr. Cliburn's spokeswoman.         Mrs. Cliburn's mother was an actress and her father was a judge and adviser to state officials. She studied music from an early age in Texas, then at the Cincinnati Conservatory and at the New York School of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.         She returned to Texas in the 1920's to marry Harvey Levan Cliburn, an oil-company executive. She gave piano lessons, and discovered her son's ability when at the age of 3 he went to the piano after one of her students left and played by ear the piece that had just been taught.         Mrs. Cliburn served as her son's adviser, manager and inspiration throughout his career. She was also active in the arts, and established a foundation to help young performers.         Her husband died in 1974. She is survived by her son, of Fort Worth.       
         Barbara Fassbinder, one of the first health care professionals to be infected with the AIDS virus while on the job, died on Tuesday at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. She was 40 and lived in Monona, Iowa.         The cause was complications from AIDS, the hospital said.         Mrs. Fassbinder was infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in 1986 while helping treat a patient in the emergency room of Memorial Hospital in Prairie du Chien, Wis.         While she was pressing gauze on a needle puncture, the patient's blood apparently mingled with her blood through small cuts on her hand from gardening, she said in 1990. The young man died, and an autopsy showed he had AIDS. But it was not until January 1987, when she tried to make a blood donation, that she discovered she had been infected.         She and her family kept the infection a secret until she decided to speak out in 1990. "My biggest fear was how the community would react to me and my kids and my husband," she said at a news conference in Iowa City in which she told her story in the hope that it would warn other health-care workers. The 1,500 people of Monona, a farming community in northeastern Iowa, gave her family "nothing but support," she said at the time.         Dr. Michael Osterholm, an AIDS expert and epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health who became a friend of her family, said she "helped bridge the gap between the worlds of the health care provider and the AIDS patient in need of competent and compassionate care like no one else could."         Mrs. Fassbinder traveled extensively, talking to people about AIDS and how to prevent infection by H.I.V., Dr. Osterholm said. She testified about AIDS before Congress, and in 1992 she was recognized by the Surgeon General and the Department of Health and Human Services for her work.         A native of Marion, Ohio, she also served on the National Health Care Reform Committee set up by Hillary Rodham Clinton and was a member of the Iowa State Commission on AIDS, Dr. Osterholm said.         She is survived by her husband, David; two daughters, Eva and Emily, and a son, Joel, all of Monona; her parents, James and Ethel Herring, of Marion, Iowa; three sisters, Kathryn Fassbinder, of Elgin, Iowa, Mary Walston of Kewaunee, Wis., and Susan Valleire of Rock Island, Ill.; four brothers, J. Stephen Herring of Idaho Falls, Idaho, Edward Herring, of Rockford, Ill., Mark Herring, of Manitowoc, Wis., and John Herring of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and a grandmother, Martha McElroy of Creston, Iowa.       
         Margaret Brown Klapthor, an expert on White House history and a former department chairman at the Smithsonian Institution, died on Monday at her home in Washington. She was 72.         The cause was stomach cancer, said a son, Paul Edward Klapthor of Sumter, S.C.         Mrs. Klapthor retired from the Smithsonian in 1983. She first went to work there as a scientific aide in 1943, and rose through the curatorial ranks in its divisions of civil and political history, becoming curator of the Smithsonian's First Ladies collection and chairman of the institution's department of national and military history.         Among her writings is the historical text in "The First Ladies Cook Book: Favorite Recipes of All the Presidents of the United States," an illustrated volume of historical lore and recipes. It was published for Parents' Magazine Press in 1965, and went through several editions.         The book was praised by Craig Claiborne, then the food critic for The New York Times, who called it "perhaps the most comprehensive and detailed volume ever written" about "what American Presidents and their wives have dined on."         It reported, for example, that Ulysses S. Grant personally selected the wines to be served at formal dinners, "though his own glass was usually turned down"; that Chester A. Arthur was an epicure who savored fine wines, and that William McKinley's taste ran to fried potatoes, bacon and eggs, johnnycakes and cherry pie.         Mrs. Klapthor also wrote "First Ladies" (sixth edition 1990, White House Historical Society) and was a co-author, with her father, Paul D. Brown, of "The History of Charles County, Maryland," in 1958.         She gave lectures on White House history that detailed the occupants' idiosyncrasies, like Dolley Madison's conversational icebreaker of reading a passage from whatever book she was carrying at the time.         In the 1950's, when Mrs. Klapthor was in charge of the gowns of White House hostesses, she discovered Dolley Madison's inauguration gown, which had been kept by heirs. She traced it to the William Rockwell Nelson Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the gallery then sent it to the Smithsonian on indefinite loan.         As associate curator in the division of political history, Mrs. Klapthor assembled a Smithsonian collection of White House china in connection with her creation of First Ladies Hall, a modernized setting for the Smithsonian's First Ladies costume collection.         Sometimes she talked about more recent First Ladies. In 1988, commenting on reports of summit talk tiffs between Nancy Reagan and Raisa M. Gorbachev, the wife of the Soviet leader, Mrs. Klapthor said in an interview in The Times, "It struck me as something that had been manufactured by the press."         Mrs. Klapthor was born in Henderson, Ky., reared in Charles County and graduated from the University of Maryland.         In the last 21 years she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, and was confined to a wheelchair for the last two years. Her husband, Frank Edward Klapthor, died earlier this year.         Besides her son Paul, she is survived by another son, Carlson Brown Klapthor of Washington; a daughter, Frances Andrews of Baltimore; a sister, Mary Berry Moore of Port Tobacco, Md., and four grandchildren.       
         Martha Raye, the big-mouthed, big-hearted entertainer whose career spanned the decades from vaudeville to videos, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         In recent years, she had suffered a serious of ailments, including a stroke and circulatory difficulties. Ron Wise, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai, said, "Her death was an aggregate of that and other problems."         Miss Raye sang, she danced, she acted on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television, but the knockabout comic won perhaps her greatest renown as an indefatigable trouper who traveled thousands of miles through three wars to lift the morale of America's fighting forces.         "They ask so little and give so much," she said during the Vietnam War. "The least we can do back home here is give them the love, the respect and the dignity that they, our flag and our country deserve."         Her real name was Margie Yvonne Reed. She was born on Aug. 27, 1916, into a show-business family in the charity ward of a hospital in Butte, Mont. Her father and mother, Pete Reed and the former Peggy Hooper, were Irish immigrants whose song-and-dance routine, under the name Reed and Hooper, took them to carnivals and vaudeville houses around the United States.         "I didn't work until I was 3," Miss Raye was to say years later. "But after that, I never stopped."         Her mother taught her to read and write while the family, which also included her sister and brother, crisscrossed the country. From time to time, she attended schools in Montana, Chicago and New York.         "Our home was in an old, broken down Pierce Arrow auto which my father drove," Miss Raye remembered. "We put the scenery in the back seat and that was where we slept at night. We cooked on Sterno. And we went from town to town, looking for bookings."         She played burlesque houses, nightclubs and saloons, where she said she worked for tips only. "On a good night, I made a dollar," she said. "On a bad one, 25 cents."         At 15, she was singing, dancing and clowning in a children's act. She picked the name Martha Raye from a phone book and piled up the credits. She was a member of the Benny Davis Revue and the Ben Blue Company, a trouper on the Loew's vaudeville circuit, a member of the Will Morrisey act and a feature performer in "Earl Carroll's Sketchbook" and "Calling All Stars."         Eventually she made her way to Hollywood. And on one of the Sunday nights when stars gathered and entertained one another at the Trocadero nightclub, she got a couple of her friends to play straightmen to her comedy. Their names were Jimmy Durante and Joe E. Lewis. The producer Norman Taurog saw her perform, and the next day she was working with Bing Crosby on the 1936 film "Rhythm on the Range." She did a slapstick drunk scene and sang a song called "Mr. Paganini," and became a star overnight.         Miss Raye appeared in films like "Waikiki Wedding," "College Holiday," "Give Me a Sailor," "Keep 'em Flying" and "Hellzapoppin." In 1940, she starred on Broadway opposite Al Jolson in the revue "Hold Onto Your Hats." She appeared on his radio show and the programs of Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope.         During World War II, she began entertaining troops, and the 1944 film "Four Jills in a Jeep" was based on a U.S.O. tour of bases in England and Africa she made in the company of Kay Francis, Carole Landis and Mitzi Mayfair.         In 1969, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Miss Raye the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her wartime efforts, and she was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.         She was not happy about her Hollywood career, except for "Monsieur Verdoux," Charlie Chaplin's controversial 1947 black comedy about a Parisian Bluebeard who marries and kills for money. "I must have made 35 or 40 movies and most of them were mindless," Miss Raye said. "But in those days actors didn't fight the system; then we thought we were lucky to be under contract."         Her performance in "Verdoux," in which she portrayed Annabella Bonheur, a raucous, indestructible wife of the killer, was praised as brilliant by Bosley Crowther of The New York Times. "Do you know," she recalled in 1972, "that when Chaplin called to offer me the part, I hung up on him; I thought it was a joke."         She blamed her decline in Hollywood on executives who focused on her shapely legs and ability to fill out a sweater. "They tried to make a glamour girl out of me," the brown-haired, blue-eyed actress complained. "Let's face it, I'm not a glamour girl. I'm a clown."         Despite her setbacks in Hollywood, she was far from finished. Milton Berle gave her a start in television, and by 1954, she was the medium's reigning female comedian. Ahead of her was more success in nightclubs, cabaret and theater.         Offstage, life was darker. "As an entertainer, she's a genius," one of her colleagues once said. "Socially, she's completely unsure of herself."         She married again and again. Among her husbands were the makeup artist Buddy Westmore, the composer David Rose, the businessman Neal Lang, the dancers Nick Condos and Edward Begley and the policeman Robert O'Shea. Her last marriage was in 1991, to 42-year-old Mark Harris, her manager.         She had a daughter, Melody, by Mr. Condos. After Miss Raye suffered a stroke in 1991, she and Melody battled in court over control of the actress's money. In July 1992, Miss Raye filed a lawsuit alleging that the 1991 Bette Midler-James Caan film "For the Boys" wrongfully appropriated her life story. A judge dismissed the $5 million complaint earlier this year.         In her later years, many people knew Miss Raye as the star of Polident commercials.         She is survived by her husband and her daughter.       
         Pearl Primus, a pioneering dancer, choreographer and teacher whose anthropological work exposed Americans to the realities of black life in America and to the richness of African and Caribbean dance, died on Saturday at her home in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 74.         Miss Primus died after a brief illness, said Joyce Knight, a friend.         A powerful performer and lecturer, Miss Primus played a role similar to that of Katherine Dunham in establishing dance by and about blacks as an important part of American culture. Her belief that there was material for dance in the everyday lives of black people -- and her strong personality and early success -- had a profound influence on several generations of black choreographers and dancers, among them Donald McKayle and Alvin Ailey.         Miss Primus visited Africa for the first time in 1948, but she had begun to present carefully researched dance with African themes in 1943 and was the first American choreographer to do so. In 1974, her contributions were celebrated in a salute to her and the ballerina Janet Collins by the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater.         But Miss Primus was equally celebrated for her depiction of American life and of the injustices inflicted on black Americans, particularly in the American South. In one of her best-known dances, "Strange Fruit," a woman reacts in horror to a lynching. "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" -- created, like "Strange Fruit," in 1943 and inspired by the Langston Hughes poem -- depicted the Mississippi and the hard lives of blacks along its shores. "Dance has been my freedom and my world," she said in 1991. "I dance not to entertain but to help people better understand each other."         An accident of fate led Miss Primus to become a dancer. Born in Trinidad, she was brought to the United States as a child by her parents. She received a bachelor's degree in biology and pre-medical sciences from Hunter College with the intention of becoming a doctor. Unable to find a laboratory job open to blacks, she applied to the National Youth Administration and was put into a dance group.         She enrolled in modern-dance classes at the New Dance Group, where she began to teach, and in 1943 gave the first performance of her own work. John Martin wrote in The New York Times that "if ever a young dancer was entitled to a company of her own and the freedom to do what she chooses with it, she is it."         A few months later, Barney Josephson invited Miss Primus to perform at his Cafe Society Downtown. Troubled by having to choose between medicine and dance, she consulted Mr. Martin. No one would ever be able to say, he told her, whether art or medicine had the greater curative power. Miss Primus remained at the nightclub for 10 months. When there was a problem with the music during her first performance there, a burly man rose from the audience and encouraged her to keep on, teasing her about having broken up his home by teaching his son the Lindy Hop. The man was Paul Robeson, one of many black cultural figures with whom Miss Primus would become friendly over the years.         Miss Primus toured with the musical "Show Boat," then founded a company and presented her work on Broadway and in national tours. On one Southern tour, she was offered a Rosenwald Foundation scholarship to study dance in Africa. Later, she worked there with local performers. She married Percival Borde, a dancer she met on a visit home to Trinidad in 1953, and they founded a popular school in New York and performed frequently together. Mr. Borde died in 1979.         Miss Primus was made director of a new performing-arts center in Monrovia, Liberia, in 1959. Two years later, she and Mr. Borde performed throughout Africa with their dancers and musicians on a tour sponsored by the Rebekah Harkness Foundation. It was not until 1978 that she completed her work for a doctorate in anthropology at New York University.         "My life has been like traveling up a river," she told an interviewer in 1979. "Every now and then I would hear singing around the bend, and so around the bend I would go and become occupied with living."         Miss Primus continued to perform until 1980, after which she was the director of the Cora P. Maloney College, a black studies school at the State University of New York at Buffalo, and was Five-College Professor of Ethnic Studies at schools in Massachusetts in the 1980's. She was an early and important participant in "The Black Tradition in American Dance," a program to revive and preserve black dance that began in 1988 at the American Dance Festival, where in 1991 she was named the first recipient of the Balasaraswati/ Joy AnnDewey Beinecke Chair for Distinguished Teaching. Other honors included the National Medal of the Arts in 1991. Miss Primus continued to teach throughout the United States until her death.         She is survived by a son, Onwin Borde of Miami.       
         Wilma Rudolph, who grew from a sickly child unable to walk into a statuesque athlete of 20 who won three gold medals as a sprinter in the 1960 Olympics in Rome, died yesterday at her home in Brentwood, Tenn., near Nashville. She was 54.         Her sister, Charlene Rudolph, said Rudolph learned in July that she had a malignant brain tumor.         Rudolph was a handsome, regal woman, 6 feet tall, charming, graceful and gracious. Over seven days, she became the first woman to win three gold medals in track and field in one Olympics. She also became America's greatest female sports hero since Babe Didrikson Zaharias a generation earlier.         She competed in an era in which Olympic sports such as track and field were completely amateur, and for years later, as a frequent spokeswoman for Olympic-family organizations and causes, she preached the idealism of that bygone era.         "I love what the Olympics stand for," she said. "They'll always be a part of me."         As Barbara Heilman wrote in Sports Illustrated, "She can command a look of mingled graciousness and hauteur that suggests a duchess, but in a crowd that is one part Skeeter and 5,000 parts people, young men and babies will come to her in 30 seconds."         Skeeter was the nickname bestowed by her high school basketball coach, Clinton Gray, who considered her more mosquito than basketball player. "You're just like a skeeter," he said. "You're little, you're fast and you always get in my way."         Her life story was so dramatic that in 1977 it became a two-hour prime-time television movie. The movie was written, produced and directed by her friend Bud Greenspan, the Olympic historian.         "She was the Jesse Owens of women's track and field, and like Jesse, she changed the sport for all time," he said. "She became the benchmark for little black girls to aspire."         Wilma Glodean Rudolph was born on June 23, 1940, in the St. Bethlehem section of Clarksville, Tenn., 45 miles north of Nashville, and grew up in Clarksville. She was the 20th of 22 children of Ed Rudolph, a railroad porter, from two marriages. Her mother, Blanche, was a domestic.         The child weighed four and a half pounds at birth. At age 4, she contracted double pneumonia and scarlet fever simultaneously and almost died. The illnesses left her left leg paralyzed, and once a week, on her mother's day off, the mother made a 90-mile round trip with her to Nashville for heat and water treatment on the leg.         At 6, she started to hop on one leg. At 8, she started to walk with a leg brace. Later, an orthopedic shoe replaced the brace. One day, when she was 11, her mother found her playing basketball in her bare feet. That was the end of the special shoe and the beginning of a fabled sports career.         "My father pushed me to become competitive," she wrote in a 1978 autobiography, "Wilma." "With so many children, when you did something with one, you always had another along. He felt that sports would help me overcome the problems."         At 13, she went out for the high school basketball team and twice made the all-state team. She would sometimes skip school to run on a track across the street. Her talent intrigued Ed Temple, the renowned coach at Tennessee State University in Nashville, and at his invitation she attended his summer track camps.         In 1956, a 16-year-old stringbean of 89 pounds, she ran in the Melbourne Olympics. To her dismay, she was eliminated in the 200-meter heats. She did win a bronze medal in the 400-meter relay.         Then she returned to high school. When she graduated, Temple gave her an athletic scholarship at Tennessee State. Bulked up to 130 pounds, she made the 1960 Olympic team. Temple was the women's coach.         The day before the 100 meters in the Rome Olympics, she stepped into a hole in the infield of the practice track and twisted an ankle. It became swollen and discolored. The next day, the ankle held up, and with her fluid running style she won her semifinal in 11.3 seconds, equaling the world record. She won the final easily in 11.0 seconds, but the following wind of 6.15 miles an hour (the allowable limit is 4.47) precluded recognition as a world record.         In the 200 meters, she set an Olympic record of 23.2 seconds in the heats and won the final easily in 24.0 seconds into a stiff wind. In the 400-meter relay, with college teammates running the first three legs, she helped set a world record of 44.4 seconds in a heat. In the final, after a bad baton pass to her, she turned a two-yard deficit into a three-yard victory in 44.5 seconds.         "After the playing of 'The Star-Spangled Banner,' " she wrote in her autobiography, "I came away from the victory stand and I was mobbed. People were jumping all over me, putting microphones into my face, pounding my back, and I couldn't believe it."         She returned to college and earned a degree in education in 1961. She was voted the 1961 Sullivan Award as America's outstanding amateur athlete, male or female.         But there was no money for amateurs then and no professional track, so she set out to make a living. She taught second grade and coached high school basketball and track in Tennessee, all for $400 a month. Then she ran a community center in Indiana for $600 a month.         She last raced in 1962. She quit, she said, because "I couldn't top what I did, so I'll be remembered for when I was at my best."         In time, she became a spokeswoman for a movie studio, a baking company and other businesses. At DePauw University in Indiana, she coached briefly and recruited minority-group students. She established the Wilma Rudolph Foundation, working with youngsters and sending tutors to schools with books on American heros.         "If I have anything to leave," she said, "the foundation is my legacy."         She was voted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame, the Helms Hall of Fame, the Women's Sports Foundation Hall of Fame and the Black Athletes Hall of Fame. In 1988, Tennessee State named an indoor track in her honor. In 1990, she became the first woman to receive the National Collegiate Athletic Association's Silver Anniversary Award, even though she competed before the N.C.A.A. sponsored women's championships in any sport.         Once, when she was asked how certain other runners compared with her, she declined to answer.  "I'm selfish," she said. "I think I was in a class all by myself."         She married William Ward in 1961 and was divorced the next year. In 1963, she married Robert Eldridge, whom she had known since second grade. They were divorced in 1976.         Her father died in 1961 and her mother died in May. She is survived by her four children with Mr. Eldridge -- daughters Yolanda Jones and Djuana Bowers and sons Robert and Xurry -- five sisters and two brothers, and seven grandchildren.         Correction:  November 25, 1994, Friday         An obituary of Wilma Rudolph on Nov. 13, as well as a Sports of The Times column that day, misstated her accomplishment in winning three gold medals in track and field at the 1960 Olympics in Rome. She was the first American woman to win three or more medals in one Olympics, not the first woman; Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands won four gold medals at the 1948 Games in London.       
         Mildred Hilson, a grande dame of New York's charity circuit who entertained royalty and heads of state in her suite at the Waldorf Towers, died yesterday morning at home. She was 96.         She had been in poor health for five years, her granddaughter, Wendy Levey, said.         Even in her later years, Mrs. Hilson possessed a certain mischievous charm. "She lived on chocolate-covered marshmallows," Mrs. Levey said. "She had them hidden all over the house. The only ones who knew where they were were she and my 5-year-old daughter, Mariel."         Mrs. Hilson was the widow of Edwin I. Hilson, an investment banker, who died in 1952. She took his seat on the board of the Hospital for Special Surgery after his death, and five years later was named vice president, a title she held until her death.         As perennial chairwoman of the hospital's annual benefit, Mrs. Hilson raised more than $15 million. The plaza of a new hospital residence was dedicated to her in 1989. That year another of her charities, the New York City division of the American Cancer Society, gave her its humanitarian award. She also received the Sarnoff Award for volunteer service from the women's division of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.         An effective fund-raiser for the Republican Party, Mrs. Hilson lent her name to a series of citizens' committees to elect or re-elect Republican candidates to state and national office.         She was a patron of the arts, serving on the board of the Museum of the City of New York and on the New York City Cultural Council. In the late 1960's she was Mayor John V. Lindsay's unsalaried representative on cultural affairs.         "Don't make me sound all good-workish," she once told an interviewer. "I really so enjoy life. I adore to entertain."         The guest lists for her parties were dazzling. The Duke and Duchess of Windsor were among those who dined in her scarlet drawing room, as were the actor Laurence Olivier, numerous United Nations ambassadors and several American presidents.         President George Bush and his wife, Barbara, who occupied a Towers suite when he was chief United States delegate to the United Nations, returned to visit their friend and neighbor after moving to the White House.         President Dwight D. Eisenhower painted a portrait of Mrs. Hilson that hangs in her study. And in 1988, former President Richard M. Nixon played "Happy Birthday" on the piano at her 90th-birthday gala at the St. Regis while 200 guests sang along.         Mrs. Hilson maintained her interest in politics throughout her life. "Only a year ago, when Mayor Giuliani and his wife, Donna, were dining at my apartment," Mrs. Levey said, "she called and asked to speak to the Mayor and gave him half an hour of her advice on running the city."         A stately, elegant woman almost 6 feet tall, Mrs. Hilson was dressed by several of the great couturiers. In 1989, although bedridden, she was still able to have a preview of the spring collection, when Hubert de Givenchy took one of his models to her apartment for a private showing.  Mrs. Hilson's daughter, Mary Wolf, died in 1987, and her son, John S., in 1991. She is survived, in addition to Mrs. Levey, by four grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.       
         By all appearances, this was a great year for Alix Gres, the French fashion designer. There was a retrospective of her work held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in September, attended by Yuzo Yagi, the chairman of Yagi Tsusho Ltd., the Japanese company that had bought the rights to her name in 1988 and had sponsored the exhibition. In Japan, the company was promoting her name anew.         And she was being heralded by fellow couturiers like Yves Saint Laurent, who marveled at the show in an interview in Women's Wear Daily. Her daughter, Anne Gres (the name is pronounced greh), provided the fashion industry newspaper with a response she said her mother had dictated on Oct. 9. "Coming from an artist and colleague whom I admire," said an excerpt published on Nov. 1, "I'm greatly touched."         So the fashion world was startled to learn yesterday that Mme. Gres, as she is always called by those in her trade, had been dead for more than a year. Born on Nov. 30, 1903, she died on Nov. 24, 1993, in a retirement home in the south of France, a fact that was carefully hidden by her daughter.         In a front-page story in the French newspaper Le Monde, Anne Gres said she had disguised the death of her mother for the last 13 months for two reasons. "First of all, I looked to protect her," she said. "All those who have profited from her would again find the means to draw on her money." The second reason she gave was respect for the older sister of Mme. Gres, who is still alive. She added that she did not yet have the money to buy the sort of tomb that would dignify her mother's memory. "It made me suffer more," she said about hiding the news. "It is like it didn't happen."         No one knew about Mme. Gres's death until the article appeared. Not her closest friends and peers, Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy. Not Jacques Mouclier, the head of the Chambre Syndicale, the governing body of French fashion, where she held the title of honorary president for life. Not Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute exhibition, and not even Mr. Yagi, the owner of the rights to her name.         Those interviewed in Paris as the news spread expressed confusion at the charade, which was revealed when Le Monde uncovered a document in a district mayor's office in Paris confirming her death. It was verified in interviews with residents of the home in St.-Paul-de-Vence where Mme. Gres had lived.         For the French fashion industry, where designer names are often bought and sold without consulting the founders, it is an eerie illustration of how a design house can continue on without its progenitor.         Mme. Gres was the last survivor of her generation of couturiers, which included Madeleine Vionnet, Jeanne Lanvin, Elsa Schiaparelli and Gabrielle Chanel. Although some have asked whether there could have been a commercial reason for her daughter's actions, it seems unlikely, given the number of houses in Paris that continue after the designer has died, from Balenciaga to Chanel and Christian Dior, where big-name designers took over the workrooms.         "It is very difficult to express oneself on hearing such a frightening piece of news," Mr. de Givenchy said in a fax. "I was very shocked to learn of the passing of such a 'grande dame' like this one a year too late. Mme. Gres was a person who was very discreet and very humble, and maybe this was her decision."         Her clients, often the people closest to designers who work in couture, as Mme. Gres did, were especially shocked at the news. Sao Schlumberger, who donated a dress to the Costume Institute for the exhibition, said: "It is quite strange. Some time ago I talked with the Duchess of Orleans, who was a customer of hers and a close friend, and she said she went to visit her in an old people's home. And the first time she recognized her, but the last time she didn't recognize her at all."         One reason Mme. Gres was able to fade away was that she was no longer active in her house, which she sold in 1984 to the French industrialist Bernard Tapie. She later told Mr. Cardin that the decision was the worst she had ever made, recalled Bernard Danillon, the communications director for Pierre Cardin. Mr. Cardin had tried to stay in touch with Mme. Gres, Mr. Danillon said, but "every time that anyone asks about Mme. Gres to Jacques Mouclier, the answer was given by her daughter, and she said always, 'Mme. Gres wants to be quiet, she doesn't want to be disturbed, she doesn't want to talk to anybody.' "         "After years and years of getting this answer, you don't call again," Mr. Danillon said. "You respect someone's wish."         At the Costume Institute, Mr. Martin said he had made two attempts to contact Mme. Gres, one when the show was in the planning stage, the other when it was ready to open, inviting her to come. "We took the Women's Wear Daily response as being the sure indication that Mme. Gres was aware of the show," Mr. Martin said. "Maybe you wouldn't have told people if you were reclusive, but to create a fiction, a fabrication of her being alive? I don't even understand what the purpose would be."         Everyone who wrote about the exhibition discussed the designer in the present tense. Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times: "A nonagenarian, she is one of the great female designers who dominated haute couture in Paris until after World War II, when the men took over."         Those who admire her work are feeling haunted, having missed a long mourning period.         "It gives me goose bumps," said Susan Gutfreund, a client of Mme.  Gres who also shared a Paris hairdresser with her. She last saw her four years ago. "Her daughter must have had a reason to hide it, but I find it very sad," she said.         One of the reasons for the deception may have been the resentment that Anne Gres indicated to Le Monde over the way the French fashion industry had reacted in 1987, when her mother's couture house was liquidated after rent on her atelier went unpaid for two years. "No one did anything," Anne Gres said, when wooden mannequins, toiles and partly finished dresses were thrown into trash bags.         The house was emptied in a day. "That day there, she had paid in full, because they had stolen her life," she said.         In 1988, the house was bought by Mr. Yagi. Her daughter condemned the fashion professionals yesterday in Le Monde. "Mme. Gres is the Bosnia of couture," she said, always speaking in the present tense. "Except for Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy, who has tried to help her?"         Mme. Gres's death is remarkable in the way its secrecy mirrors her life. In interviews throughout her career, she refused to reveal her age, her parents' backgrounds (her grandparents were said to be Italian and German) or even her real name. Gres was the name taken by her husband, Serge Czerefkow, a Russian painter she married in the 30's. She was born Germaine Krebs, then changed her name to Alix Barton. The Metropolitan Museum's catalogue told her life story simply: "Mme. Gres is a creation," it said.         Trained as a sculptor, she began designing clothes in 1930 after learning sketching and cutting at the house of Premet. She then worked for a house called, coincidentally, Alix. During World War II, she started her own house, called Gres, one of only 20 that stayed open throughout the war.         By the 1950's, Mme. Gres had fully developed what became her signature. She devoted herself early on to draping, and even her name began to evoke images of Grecian dress. Soon she was dressing the society women who became devoted to her, and wives of heads of state, including Princess Grace, Jacqueline Kennedy and Danielle Mitterrand.         "Mme. Gres is one of the most important 20th-century designers," Mr. Martin said of his decision to hold a retrospective of her work. "Along with Vionnet and Chanel, Mme. Gres was making the most advanced clothing in Paris in the 1930's."         It was not until 1980 that Mme. Gres showed a ready-to-wear line, 10 years after her peers had done so.         In an interview with Women's Wear Daily in 1975, she said: "From the beginning, I didn't want to do what others were doing in any way. I wasn't able to, because I didn't have the knowledge. That was one reason I took the material and worked directly on it. I used the knowledge I had, which was sculpture."       
         Catherine Filene Shouse, the philanthropist and arts patron who was the founder and major benefactor of the Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts in Virginia, died yesterday at her home in Naples, Fla. She was 98 and also had homes in Washington, Easton, Md., and Vienna, Va., where Wolf Trap is situated.         The cause of death was heart failure, said Carol Harford, a longtime friend who is president emeritus of the Wolf Trap Foundation, which presents the park's arts programs under the auspices of the Department of the Interior.         Mrs. Shouse, the heiress to a retailing fortune, was a lifelong champion of the performing arts whose accomplishments and philanthropic ventures earned recognition from the highest quarters. In 1977, President Gerald Ford gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A year earlier, Queen Elizabeth II had made her Dame Commander of the British Empire. This past October, she was among 12 Americans to receive the National Medal of Arts.         Catherine Filene was born in Boston in 1896. Her grandfather, William Filene, was the founder of the Filene's department-store chain, and her father, Lincoln Filene, founded Federated Department Stores. She graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., in 1918, and earned a master's degree in education at Harvard University in 1923.         Over seven decades, Mrs. Shouse held a remarkable variety of public and private posts. In 1919, she became the first woman appointed to the Democratic National Committee, and in the mid-1920's, she served under President Calvin Coolidge as chairwoman of the First Federal Prison for Women, where she instituted a job training and rehabilitation program.         In the 1940's, she became a dog breeder, importing hunting dogs from Germany and Switzerland and starting her own kennel at Wolf Trap Farm, a tract of land across the Potomac River, 15 miles west of Washington, that she had purchased in 1930.         In 1949, she joined the National Symphony Orchestra's board, and she served as its vice president from 1951 through 1968. In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her to the first board of the National Cultural Center, now known as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to which she was reappointed twice by President Richard M. Nixon. As late as 1991, she was invited by the Yale School of Music to serve on its board.         Mrs. Shouse's most lasting legacy, however, is Wolf Trap. In 1966, at the age of 70, she donated 100 acres of the farm in Vienna to the United States Government to create a national park for the performing arts. There, under the auspices of the Department of the Interior, Mrs. Shouse established the Wolf Trap Foundation to manage the park, arrange programming and raise money, a unique partnership among the public and private sectors for managing an arts center. The park opened in 1971 and since then has been home to performances by some of the world's great musicians, dancers, singers and actors.         In 1982, the main amphitheater burned to the ground, but Mrs. Shouse led the drive to resurrect it, and a new theater, the 7,000-seat Filene Center (half the $18 million cost came from a Congressional appropriation), opened in 1984. It is now visited by some 500,000 people annually.         During her last decade, Mrs. Shouse, who was known to her friends as Kay, suffered from arthritis but remained a familiar figure at Wolf Trap, touring the grounds in a golf cart.         She was married twice, in 1921, to Alvin E. Dodd, a businessman from whom she was divorced in 1930. Two years later, she married Jouett Shouse, the chairman of the Democratic National Executive Committee. Shouse, a lawyer and businessman, had been a Congressman from Kansas and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Coolidge. He died in 1967.         Mrs. Shouse is survived by a daughter, Joan Dodd Tolley of Naples, four grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.       
         Mildred Orrick, a designer who gave women's fashion a natural, informal look for more than three decades, died on Dec. 9 at her home in Elliston, Va., where she had lived for the last 20 years. She was 88.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Sarah Orrick of Washington.         With the emergence of American designers as a dominant influence in the 1940's, Mrs. Orrick was one of the new generation of designers who were leading fashion toward sensible clothes at a time when the market was quickly growing.         Her earliest best-known designs, which were produced for Janice Milan Inc. in the late 1940's, represented her view of a look that was feminine but simple. But there had been a practicality and an originality to her work almost from the start.         As a costume designer in the early 40's, she put dancers' leotards in her sketches for Harper's Bazaar as a style that was suitable for wearing off the rehearsal floor. Quickly, they became part of the day's outfits.         By the 1950's, her designs were a regular part of New York fashion shows. At the same time, she was offering outfits that could be sewn at home.         In 1958, she continued her work under the label of Claire McCardell, a designer and friend of Mrs. Orrick who had died the year before. In 1963, she became a designer for Villager Clothes, a highly successful line that operated out of Philadelphia.         She retired in the mid-1970's.         Mrs. Orrick studied at the Parsons School of Design in New York and Paris. She started as a costume designer and worked for Natasha Rambova.         She also worked for Norman Bel Geddes, the stage and industrial designer, designing costumes for productions of "Lysistrata" and "Hamlet" in the 1920's and 1930's.         Her husband of 62 years, Jesse Lewis Orrick, died in 1992. She is also survived by a daughter, Martha Orrick of Colorado Springs, Colo.; a son, Nicholas, of Andover, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Helen Payne Wilshire Walsh, who for decades worked on behalf of the disabled, died on Monday in Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. A resident of Greenwich, she was 97.         Mrs. Walsh suffered a long illness, said her niece, Helen Payne Clarke, also of Greenwich.         To Fairfield County, Mrs. Walsh was a matriarch of Republican politics and a doyenne of society. But she was known internationally for her work with the disabled, traveling the world to speak, raise funds and visit hospitals and refugee camps.         She was a friend of former President George Bush, at one time a Greenwich resident, who appointed her to a three-year term on the National Council on Disability in 1990 when she was 92. The panel drafts legislation on behalf of the disabled.         "Of all the people who gave of themselves to the political process," Mr. Bush said from his office in Houston, "Helen Walsh ranks right up there with those I admired the most." She was, he said, a "revered friend and an inspiration to me in both my private and public life."         Over the years, Mrs. Walsh worked inside many institutions and organizations, including the Institute of Rehabilitative Medicine of New York University Medical Center. She served as president of Rehabilitation International USA and vice president of Rehabilitation International, a worldwide volunteer agency.         President Richard M. Nixon named her to his National Advisory Council of Vocational Rehabilitation in the early 1970's.         She received the 1972 Howard A. Rusk Award from the Institute for Rehabilitative Medicine.         She was vice chairman of the Republican Town Committee and a member of the party's State Central and Finance Committees.         Helen Payne was born in 1897 in Cincinnati. She came to Greenwich in 1932 with her first husband, Joseph Wilshire, a future chairman of Standard Brands. He died in 1951, and in 1968 she married William Walsh, a political consultant, who died in 1983.         Mrs. Walsh is survived by a stepson, William James Walsh, of Princeton, N.J., and two step-grandsons, Joseph W. Wilshire 4th of Goshen, Conn., and Van H. Wilshire of Greenwich.       
         Julie Haydon, the actress who created the role of the fragile Laura Wingfield in the original production of "The Glass Menagerie," died on Saturday in La Crosse, Wis. She was 84.         The cause was abdominal cancer, said Patricia Angelin, the executor of the estate of George Jean Nathan. Miss Haydon was the widow of Nathan, the drama critic.         When "The Glass Menagerie" opened on Broadway in 1945, it immediately established Tennessee Williams's reputation and represented an important return to the theater for Laurette Taylor, who played Amanda Wingfield, a fictional representation of the playwright's mother. Though overshadowed by Miss Taylor, Miss Haydon, as the young girl who cherished her collection of glass figurines, shared in the praise. In his review in The New York Times, Lewis Nichols wrote that she brought "a shy helplessness, a desire to be liked" to a role that was based on Williams's sister.         Miss Haydon was born in Oak Park, Ill. When she was 19, she toured with Minnie Maddern Fiske in "Mrs. Bumpstead Leigh." Two years later, she played Ophelia in a production of "Hamlet" at the Hollywood Playhouse. Among her films were "Age of Innocence" (with Irene Dunne), "The Scoundrel" (with Noel Coward) and "A Family Affair," the first in the Andy Hardy series. While appearing on the stage in California in "Autumn Crocus" (with Frances Lederer) she met Nathan.         She made her Broadway debut in 1935 in Philip Barry's "Bright Star," which closed after seven performances. Several subsequent plays were successes, including Paul Vincent Carroll's "Shadow and Substance," in which she played a saintly maid, and William Saroyan's Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Time of Your Life," in which she created the role of the prostitute Kitty Duval.         Also in the cast of "The Time of Your Life" were Gene Kelly and Eddie Dowling. Later she appeared in Saroyan's "Sweeney in the Trees" and "Hello, Out There," opposite Dowling. Reviewing "Hello, Out There," Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times that together they gave "a lyrical performance of great enchantment."         Dowling was the director as well as a star of "The Glass Menagerie" (in the role based on the author). After that historic production, Miss Haydon acted in several other Broadway plays, including Ferenc Molnar's "Miracle in the Mountains." Her performance in "The Glass Menagerie" remained the high point of her career.         She married Nathan in 1955. After his death in 1958, she made guest appearances in various plays often in community theaters and on college campuses. She also lectured in programs drawn from her husband's many books. In 1962 she left New York and returned to the Midwest. For 10 years she was actress in residence at the College of St. Teresa in Winona, Minn.         She played the mother in revivals of "The Glass Menagerie," and in 1980, still petite with a cameo face, she returned to the New York theater to do the role off Broadway, opposite Ms. Angelin as the daughter.         She is survived by her sister, Miriam Donaldson Ziegler of Los Angeles.
