Martin, founder of the National Federation of Republican Women's Clubs, died Thursday at her home here. She was 86 years old.         Miss Martin also was assistant chairman of the Republican National Committee.         She was educated at Wellesley College, Mass., and the University of Maine. Her political career began in 1930 with her election to the Maine House. She was re-elected to a second term, then won two terms in the State Senate.         She was the only woman and nonlawyer on the Senate's Legal Affairs Committee. On that panel, she once said, she ''could get just so far in an argument, then I'd hit a stone wall of legal phraseology - so I studied law in self-defense.'' Between legislative sessions, she took law courses at Yale and Northwestern universities.         From 1936 to 1946, she was assistant chairman of the Republican National Committee in Washington and head of its women's division. In that capacity, she founded what is now the National Federation of Republican Women.         From 1947 to 1972, in Maine, she was Commissioner of Labor and Industry for the State of Maine.       
        Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         ''The information we have is that Mrs. Manley died last night in her sleep,'' the spokesman said, giving no cause of death.         Mrs. Manley was regarded as a major Caribbean and Latin American sculptor. At the same time, she was, as the wife of one of Jamaica's leading political figures, Norman Washington Manley, a major patron of the arts.         In colonial Jamaica as early as 1937 she fostered art with her own work and by teaching a generation of Jamaican artists.         She helped found Forum, a magazine in which young Caribbean poets and writers were often first published, and helped found the Jamaica Art School.         Her own sculpture earned her international recognition, including exhibitions in France and England.         Mrs. Manley was born Edna Swithenbank, in Hampshire, England, of a Jamaican mother and a British father. In 1921 she married her first cousin, a Rhodes scholar and lawyer who founded the People's National Party in Jamaica and helped lead his country to political independence in 1962. He died in 1969.         Mrs. Manley is survived by two sons: Michael, leader of the party his father founded and Jamaica's Prime Minister from 1972 to 1980, and Douglas, a social scientist who served in his brother's Cabinet.       
        Charlotte Curtis, a columnist for The New York Times and former editor of the newspaper's family/style news and later of its Op-Ed page, died of cancer yesterday at Ohio State University Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan and Columbus.         Charlotte Curtis, a columnist for The New York Times and former editor of the newspaper's family/style news and later of its Op-Ed page, died of cancer yesterday at Ohio State University Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. She was 58 years old and lived in Manhattan and Columbus.         In a 25-year career with The Times, Miss Curtis, as a reporter and as an editor, helped transform the coverage of fashion and society news, supervised the daily page of opinion opposite the editorial page and for the last four years wrote a weekly column of social commentary.         Her column, a blend of reporting and observation that appeared each Tuesday, was discontinued last June, when Miss Curtis became ill and went to Columbus for medical treatment. Her husband, Dr. William E. Hunt, is professor and director of the division of neurologic surgery at the College of Medicine at Ohio State University.         ''Charlotte Curtis, who graced this newspaper for over 25 years, was a warm and considerate friend who could write with a rapier and who, as an editor, was eternally curious and questioning,'' Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The Times, said yesterday. ''As a person and as a superb journalist, she will be missed and mourned.'' Expanded Coverage         As editor of women's and family/ style news from 1965 to 1974, Miss Curtis worked to expand coverage of fashion, society, decor and family matters to reflect her conviction that these topics should be treated with the same emphasis on news and lively writing that politics and sports received.         Under her direction, reporting on the renascent feminist movement and on controversial issues such as abortion replaced the features on good grooming and shopping that had traditionally appeared on women's news pages.         As an associate editor of The Times in charge of the Op-Ed page from 1974 to 1982, she brought an eclectic approach to a broad range of commentary and analysis on major social, economic and political issues of the day. In that post, she was the first woman to have her name listed on the masthead of The New York Times among its senior editors.         But it was as a society news reporter in the 1960's, chronicling the life styles of the rich and powerful, that Miss Curtis became one of the nation's best-known journalists and set a pattern followed by other writers. Other publications heralded her iconoclastic style, the precision of her technique and the research behind it. ''The Times' girl on the beat studies her subjects with the detachment of a professional sociologist,'' Time magazine reported in February 1965. An Incisive Wit         A strong-willed, indefatigable Vassar graduate with an incisive wit, Miss Curtis documented the mores and foibles of America's constantly evolving upper crust. She scrutinized both aristocrats and parvenus in sybaritic settings: Manhattan penthouses, mansions in Newport and Palm Beach, yachts in the Caribbean, tents in Persepolis and the clubhouses at Churchill and Epsom Downs.         In Palm Beach, she reported on a dowager who installed a marble terrace so her dogs, suffering from the heat, could cool their bellies.         ''Bostonians are an elegantly athletic lot,'' she wrote in a 1965 story about a society ball. ''They prove it periodically by swirling, twirling and swooping about in graceful dance patterns until beads of perspiration materialize on their aristocratic brows.'' The Telling Moment         At a cocktail party held by Leonard Bernstein for the Black Panthers in 1970, when a Panther field marshal stridently outlined his tenets before a small group that included Mr. Bernstein, principal conductor of the New York Philharmonic, Miss Curtis caught the telling moment:         '' 'If business won't give us full employment, then we must take the means of production and put them in the hands of the people.'         '' 'I dig absolutely,' Mr. Bernstein said.''         Tom Wolfe, who wrote about the same party in his book ''Radical Chic and Mau-Mauing the Flak Catchers,'' said of the ensuing flap: ''It wasn't anything she wrote that infuriated them. It was that she put down exactly what they said. That's always what seems cruelest of all, to hold up a mirror to people that way.''         In addition to her society and family/ style reporting, Miss Curtis over the years pursued a variety of stories with datelines from around the world. Deep Interest in Politics         Her deepest interest, dating from her college days, was in American politics and culture. She covered a number of national political conventions, including the violence-wracked Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968, as well as Presidential campaigns and inaugurations.         In June 1968 she was in the press corps aboard the funeral train that carried the body of Senator Robert F. Kennedy from New York to Washington. Describing his eldest son, Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, she wrote about the heir to a political dynasty:         ''Down the swaying train he went, putting out his hand in 19 of the other 20 cars saying, 'I'm Joe Kennedy,' while outside in the early afternoon sun, the old men of Linden, N.J., stood silently in their undershirts and the women held handkerchiefs to their faces.         '' 'I'm Joe Kennedy,' he said to strangers, his pin-stripe black suit not yet a shambles from the failing air-conditioning, his PT boat tie clip neatly in place. 'Thanks for coming, thanks for coming.' ''         She was the author of ''First Lady,'' a 1963 book about Jacqueline Kennedy's first year in the White House, and ''The Rich and Other Atrocities,'' a 1976 collection of many of her articles. She also contributed writings to several other books, wrote articles for magazines and was a radio commentator in New York and Ohio. Many Honors for Reporting         Miss Curtis was the recipient of many honors for her reporting, including awards from the New York Newspaper Women's Club, the Ohio Newspaper Women's Club, the New York and Los Angeles branches of Women in Communications, the American Newspaper Women's Club, the American Civil Liberties Union and the University of Southern California. She also received five honorary degrees.         A porcelain figurine of a woman with pale blue eyes and impeccably coiffed auburn hair, Miss Curtis stood 5 feet 1 inch tall in her high-heeled Chanel pumps. Her image of Junior League elegance - ladylike suits, discreet quantities of real jewelry and a faint aura of expensive French perfume -was one not usually visible in newsrooms.         Charlotte Murray Curtis was born in Chicago on Dec. 19, 1928, the daughter of George Morris and Lucile Atcherson Curtis. Her father was a surgeon who later took the family to Columbus, and her mother was a diplomat who had been the first woman to be a field officer in the Foreign Service, holding posts with American legations in Switzerland, Panama and Haiti.         Miss Curtis graduated from the Columbus School for Girls, then went to Vassar College in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., majoring in United States history. After graduating in 1950, she joined The Columbus Citizen, where she was a reporter and society editor for 11 years. Joined The Times in 1961         In 1961, she was hired by The New York Times as a fashion reporter. Two years later, she was assigned to the society beat, with a mandate from Clifton Daniel, then an assistant managing editor, to ''write about society as news and to treat it as sociology.''         In 1965, she was named editor of women's news, a title that was changed to family/style editor in 1971. In 1974, she became editor of the Op-Ed page, leavening serious pieces by academic, government and business leaders with unexpected essays on lighter subjects, such as an exchange of letters between Henry Miller and Erica Jong entitled ''In Praise of Rabelais and Each Other,'' and with bits of Americana, from lesser-known writers.         Besides her husband, Miss Curtis is survived by a sister, Mary Curtis Davey of Los Altos, Calif., three stepchildren and three nieces and nephews.         A memorial service will be held in New York City on a date to be set.         The family has requested that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to the William E. Hunt Fund, Ohio State University Development Fund No. 523340, in care of the Division of Neurologic Surgery, Ohio State University Hospital, 410 West 10th Avenue, N-935 D.H., Columbus, Ohio, 43210.       
        Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Born in the Clasons Point section of the East Bronx, she held the borough's at-large seat on the Council for more than 17 years. A Democrat, she had been a teacher in the city's school system and had served three and a half terms in the State Legislature before her election to the Council in 1965.         Her political career, which ended in 1983 when the at-large Council seats were abolished, was devoted largely to education and consumer causes. At budget time she often tangled with the Koch administration over what she considered to be meager funds for the public libraries. Author of Food Laws         Her legislative triumphs included the sponsorship of a law to require dairies to place dates on their milk cartons. Another law she sponsored mandated that supermarkets must list unit prices as well as package prices.         As chairwoman of the Council's General Welfare Committee, she was at the center of some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's. She was chairwoman of a series of long public hearings on proposals to require all-male private clubs to admit women.         Her position on measures that sought to guarantee the civil rights of the city's homosexuals was equivocal at times, but her handling of the issue enhanced her reputation as a skilled parliamentarian. In 1978 she scheduled hearings on the rights bill the day after the November election, leading to accusations by proponents of the bill that she had chosen a day when the public and news media would be absorbed in other matters.         On another crucial occasion the bill was stalled in the Welfare Committee when she failed to return from lunch for an important vote, even though supporters of the bill were counting on her vote. Elected to Assembly         Mrs. Ryan went into politics after her husband, E. Gerard Ryan, a lawyer, died. Only a handful of women had served in the New York State Assembly when she was elected to the Legislature in 1958.         She was active in Bronx politics in her 10 years as a teacher, and she was a former vice president of the Siwanoy Democratic Club, now defunct. She was a charter member of the Bronx Historical Society and a member of the League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Ryan was also a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Business and Professional Women's Club of New York and the Order of Our Lady of the Holy Sepulchre.         Born Aileen Barlow, she attended Public School 47 in the Bronx, Cathederal High School, Hunter College and the New York University Law School. Manhattan College awarded an honorary doctorate to her in 1974.         She was a lifelong resident of the Bronx until she moved to Point Lookout, L.I., about two years ago.         She is survived by two sons, Gerald Ryan of Rockville Centre, L.I., and Francis X. Ryan of Muttontown, L.I.; a daughter, Allana Chesney of Point Lookout, and three grandchildren.         A wake will be held today and tomorrow from 2 to 5 P.M. and from 7 to 9 P.M. at O'Shea's Funeral Home in Wantagh, L.I. A funeral mass is scheduled for 10:30 A.M. Wednesday at St. Helena's Roman Catholic Church in the Bronx.       
        Lucille Mason Rose, a former New York City Deputy Mayor, died after a heart attack Saturday in Brookdale Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.         Lucille Mason Rose, a former New York City Deputy Mayor, died after a heart attack Saturday in Brookdale Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.         ''A middle-aged energetic woman who thinks she knows where she's going'' is the way Mrs. Rose described herself 10 years ago, shortly before Mayor Abraham D. Beame appointed her a Deputy Mayor. She was the first woman to hold such a job.         Mrs. Rose, whose style reflected her youth in Virginia and Brooklyn, moved through a variety of managerial jobs related to labor.         ''I've gone step by step,'' Mrs. Rose said in 1977. ''They haven't let me skip a step.''         The first step was a job as a fiscal clerk in the Department of Social Services, which in 1949 paid $1,860 a year.         After earning a degree in economics from Brooklyn College in 1963, she was named director of the Bedford-Stuyvesant field office of the city's Department of Labor. Her responsibilities were gradually expanded, and in 1970 Mayor John V. Lindsay named her first deputy commissioner of the city Manpower and Career Development Agency.         In 1972, she became Commissioner of the Department of Employment. While she was in charge of that agency, its budget grew from $55 million to $300 million.         Mrs. Rose was born in Richmond on Sept. 27, 1920. Her family moved to Brooklyn when she was 7 years old, and her mother and father opened the Mason Dining Room at the corner of Fulton Street and Albany Avenue.         After her father died, her mother operated the 12-table restaurant by herself. Mrs. Rose's mother also made dresses in the evening to support the family. ''My mother didn't believe in welfare,'' Mrs. Rose recalled in 1972.         Mrs. Rose often left school to help serve the lunchtime crowd at the restaurant. She attended Public School 3 and was graduated from Girls High School in 1937.         During World War II, she worked as a welder in the construction of the battleship Missouri.         Mrs. Rose was the first woman president of the Catholic Interracial Council. She also held posts in other civic and political organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; the National Democratic Committee; the Salvation Army Advisory Committee, and St. Mary's Hospital. She was recently elected president of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn chapter of the Lioness Club.         She is survived by a son, Cornelius.       
        Dr. Mary E. Meade, a member of the New York City Board of Education from 1969 to 1972, died of Alzheimer's disease on Aug. 8 at the Carmel Richmond Nursing Home on Staten Island, where she had lived since 1980. She was 88 years old.         Dr. Mary E. Meade, a member of the New York City Board of Education from 1969 to 1972, died of Alzheimer's disease on Aug. 8 at the Carmel Richmond Nursing Home on Staten Island, where she had lived since 1980. She was 88 years old.         Dr. Meade was in the city's school system for a half century starting in 1918, when she became a teacher at Curtis High School on Staten Island. She was the first woman to head a coeducational high school in the city when she became principal of Tottenville High School on Staten Island in 1937. In 1944 she became principal of Washington Irving High School in Manhattan and in 1956, assistant superintendent of the city's high school division.         As a member of the Board of Education from Staten Island, she helped draw new district boundaries under decentralization.         She was born on Staten Island, was a graduate of Hunter College and Columbia University and received a doctorate in political philosophy from Fordham University in 1935.         She is survived by two brothers, John, of West Brighton, S.I., and Thomas, of Manchester, Vt., and four sisters, Margaret Van Name of Manhattan, Anne Heine of Jamesburg, N.J., Helen, of Stapleton, S.I.,, and Katherine Ryan of Black Mountain, N.C.       
        Minna Harkavy, a sculptor whose works are in the permanent collections of several major museums, died Sunday in the Bronx. She was 101 years old.         Minna Harkavy, a sculptor whose works are in the permanent collections of several major museums, died Sunday in the Bronx. She was 101 years old.         Miss Harkavy was born in Estonia, and emigrated with her family to the United States around 1900. With the exception of the 1920's and early 30's, when she joined the many expatriate American artists living in Paris, she was a resident of New York City for most of her life.         Many of her often oversized sculptures of heads or figures in stone, bronze and clay reflected her social and political concerns. One of her best-known creations, ''The Miners,'' is owned by the Museum of Modern Art. Her works were exhibited widely in the United States and Europe between the 1930's and 1960's, and several of her pieces are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Hermitage Museum in Leningrad and the Pushkin Museum in Moscow.         Her works were featured in a recent show at New York's ACA Gallery, commemorating the now-defunct New York Society of Women Artists. Miss Harkavy was among the founders of the group, which was devoted to avant-garde women artists. She also taught sculpture for many years in her penthouse studio at the Ansonia Hotel, and did many commissioned busts.         Ms. Harkavy had no survivors.       
        Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         She was widely known as the sharp-tongued wife of one of the nation's most influential publishers, Henry R. Luce, whose magazines included Time, Life and Sports Illustrated.         But she won fame on her own as magazine writer and editor, author of ''The Women'' and other hit plays, controversial Republican member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut, and, finally, in the Eisenhower Administration, a hardworking and often praised Ambassador to Italy.         She had enough careers to satisfy the ambitions of several women, but none tied her down for long. She was often on lists of the world's 10 most admired women, but her glamorous existence and tart tongue drew criticism, sometimes partisan, sometimes envious.         Clare Boothe was born in New York City on April 10, 1903, the daughter of William Franklin Boothe, a pit orchestra violinist and sometime businessman, and the former Anna Clara Snyder, who had been a chorus girl. The child was christened Ann Clare, but she never used the Ann. When Parents Separated         Her parents separated when Clare was 8 years old. She was brought up in genteel poverty by her mother, who still managed to take her to France for a year and send her to the Cathedral School of St. Mary in Garden City, L.I., and the Castle School at Tarrytown-on-Hudson, N.Y. In 1919, her mother married Dr. Albert Elmer Austin, a prominent physician in Greenwich, Conn. On a trip to Europe in 1920, the 18-year-old Clare met Elsa Maxwell among other social figures. ''I'll have her to one of my parties,'' Miss Maxwell said. ''Whatever happens then, she'll get a rich husband.''         That happened, but not because of a Maxwell party. Clare Boothe met her future husband in church: George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire-playboy son of a clothing manufacturer.         They married in 1923 in a wedding called ''the most important social event of the season.'' It was not to last. Mr. Brokaw, 23 years older than his bride, was a heavy drinker, according to one of his biographers, and was prone to abuse his wife. After six years of marriage she won a divorce on grounds of mental cruelty and was awarded $425,000 plus education expenses for her daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw. The Job at Vanity Fair         Declining to rest on her money, Clare Boothe importuned a society friend, Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue and Vanity Fair, for a job. After proving she was not another idle society matron whiling away her time between husbands, she did a stint writing photo captions for Vogue.         Vanity Fair's editor, Frank Crowninshield, hired her after demanding that she draw up a list of 100 ideas. She rose quickly to assistant editor and wrote satirical pieces about society that were later collected in a book, ''Stuffed Shirts.''         Her penthouse apartment on East 57th Street, Manhattan, drew the social, artistic and political types who peopled Vanity Fair's pages. She became managing editor, injecting more political material in an effort to revive the magazine. She left in 1934.         She had written three plays, none produced. She once said reading the plays of George Bernard Shaw was the impetus for her interest in the theater. Much later she met Shaw and is said to have gushed, ''Except for you, I wouldn't be here.'' Shaw supposedly replied, ''And now, let me see, dear child, what was your mother's name?''         Her first produced play, ''Abide with Me,'' in 1935, was unanimously deemed a disaster. It concerned a drunken, sadistic husband who is shot in the last act. Several critics commented on how quickly she responded to almost indiscernible cries of ''Author.'' She never went to another opening night. Sparks at First Sight of Luce         Two days after the opening, the author became the wife of Henry R. Luce, publisher of Time and Fortune. The two independent personalities had struck sparks on their first meeting, when they were seated together at a dinner party and Mr. Luce ignored her.         The next time they met, at a party at the Waldorf-Astoria, his future wife resolved to pay Mr. Luce back by asking rude questions. This time he was enthralled by her. He ordered her to accompany him to the Waldorf's lobby, where he said, ''You are the great love of my life, and some day I'm going to marry you.''         The marriage lasted, although there were rumored difficulties - perhaps inevitable in a marriage between two such strongminded personalities. She had her separate careers and Mr. Luce had his magazines - Life, the picture magazine, was reportedly her idea. The Successful Plays         Mrs. Luce returned to writing plays and with ''The Women,'' in 1936, recovered admirably from her maiden flop on Broadway. The play was an apotheosis of feminine bitchiness, concerning a devoted wife, the only sympathetic character, trying to win back her husband, who had been poached by a saleswoman. It earned her $2 million.         In 1938, Mrs. Luce was represented by ''Kiss the Boys Goodbye,'' a satire on the hoopla surrounding the search for the feminine lead in the movie of ''Gone With the Wind.'' It was a box-office success, as was her next play, ''Margin for Error,'' which purveyed a modish anti-Nazism.         With World War II, Mrs. Luce sought to involve herself on a larger stage. In February 1940, she sailed for Europe as an accredited correspondent for Life for a firsthand look at the war. One result was a book, ''Europe in the Spring.'' Dorothy Parker called it ''All Clare on the Western Front.''         In 1943 Mrs. Luce decided to run for the House of Representatives from Fairfield County, Conn. Criticism of Roosevelt         Despite her friendships with early New Dealers, she was by now a Republican and made speeches critical of the Roosevelt Administration's handling of the war effort. Riding an off-year tide of anti-Administration sentiment, she defeated a Democratic incumbent by 7,000 votes.         In her first speech in the House, she attacked a proposal by Vice President Henry A. Wallace calling for postwar freedom of the air. Mrs. Luce wrapped up the Wallace proposal in a single word, ''globaloney.'' In Congress she frequently spoke out on foreign policy as well as for racial equality in the armed forces and war production.         Despite her own brief infatuation with Communism in the 1930's, Mrs. Luce emerged as an early hardline anti-Communist (although as early as 1964 she was calling for more normal relations with China).         She won re-election in 1944, campaigning with fire but concealing sorrow. Her 19-year-old daughter was killed in an automobile accident that year. A Jesuit priest put her in touch with the Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, who was becoming known for his broadcasts. Before Sheen had talked three minutes, she demanded, ''Listen, if God is good, why did He take my daughter?''         ''In order that you might be here in the faith,'' Sheen replied. Became a Catholic         Their sessions, with Mrs. Luce arguing and Sheen explaining, resulted in her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1946. After that a friend noticed a gradual change in her: ''Twenty years ago she was like a diamond - beautiful, brilliant and cold. Now she is beautiful, brilliant and compassionate. She has become a kind and remarkably unselfish woman.''         Because of personal problems and long separations from her husband that her duties entailed, Mrs. Luce did not seek re-election in 1946. She remained politically active, in addition to writing a column for McCall's, and in 1952 she campaigned for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.         He offered her the post of Secretary of Labor, but she demurred. He then named her Ambassador to Italy, stirring controversy because of Mrs. Luce's Catholicism, her lack of diplomatic experience and because she was a woman.         But she waded into her job with customary energy and contempt for obstacles. She helped lay the diplomatic groundwork for an international conference that worked out a compromise on the status of Trieste, a dispute that threatened war between Yugoslavia and Italy. Effective Diplomacy         She made strongly anti-Communist speeches and warned of cutoffs of American aid to Italian industry: Communists dominated the labor unions. She drew fire from leftists.  Once her chauffeur misunderstood her directions and took her to the residence of President Giovanni Gronchi. Unable to back out, Mrs. Luce, whose relations with the President had been somewhat strained, took the occasion to persuade him to permit the stationing of American troops on Italian soil.         In Italy she caught a mysterious illness finally diagnosed as arsenic poisoning. The Central Intelligence Agency was called in. The cause was paint dust from her bedroom ceiling. A Controversy Over Brazil         In 1959 she was nominated Ambassador to Brazil. A determined one-man opposition to her appointment was mounted in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. Mrs. Luce was confirmed both by the committee and the Senate, but she could not resist a final jab at Morse.         ''My difficulties, of course, go back some years,'' she said, ''when Senator Morse was kicked in the head by a horse.'' (He was once kicked by a horse, but not in the head.) In the resultant furor, Eisenhower defended her while Mr. Luce publicly urged her to resign, which she did.         In 1964 she announced that she was running for the Senate in New York State as a Conservative Party candidate and supporter of Senator Barry Goldwater, whose nomination for President she had seconded at the Republican convention. Under pressure from the party's liberal wing and finally Senator Goldwater himself, she withdrew from the race on the eve of the Conservative convention. Moved to Honolulu         In later years she devoted herself to social life in Phoenix, where the Luces had a house - skindiving, doing mosaics and needlepoint, painting and writing. After Mr. Luce died in 1967, she moved to Honolulu, where she lived until 1983, when she moved into an apartment at the Watergate complex in Washington.''It's a city of human proportions,'' she said.         In recent years Mrs. Luce served on President Reagan's unpaid Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.         Of her writing she once said, ''I have been too involved with living to write much - or well - about life.'' A biographer, Alden Hatch, summed her up this way:         ''Brilliant, yet often foolish; idealistic, yet realistic to the verge of cynicism; tough as a Marine sergeant, but almost quixotically kind to unfortunates; with the mind and courage of a man and exceedingly feminine instincts; the complexities of her character are as numerous as the facets of her career. Probably the reason no one understands her completely is because she does not even understand herself.''         Mrs. Luce is survived by two stepsons, Henry Luce 3d and Peter Paul Luce. Interment will be private, A High Mass will be offered at noon Tuesday in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a memorial service Wednesday at 11 A. M. at the Church of St. Stephen Martyr in Washington.
