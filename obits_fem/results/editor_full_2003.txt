         Françoise Giroud, a widely admired French journalist who co-founded the political weekly L'Express and later served as France's first minister of women's affairs, died Sunday in the American Hospital of Paris. She was 86.         Her daughter said the cause of death was head injuries suffered when she fell last week.         Ms. Giroud was a slim, elegant woman known for both her charming manner and her piercing commentaries on France, the status of women and life in general. She continued working until just days ago, writing a weekly column in Le Nouvel Observateur, serving on the jury of a leading literary prize and appearing frequently on television.         Ms. Giroud was not a militant feminist in the manner of, say, Simone de Beauvoir but, as both a pioneering journalist and editor and as a cabinet minister, she served as a role model for two generations of French women seeking a more prominent role in French society. She made a particular point of encouraging young women in journalism.         While women are now highly visible in both news organizations and politics, though, she also recognized that sexual equality did not yet exist in France. In a 1996 interview, she noted: ''It's an illusion to believe that, because there are women ministers, women play a role in public affairs. There have been enormous changes, positive changes, but women still have a long way to go.''         Born in Geneva on Sept. 21, 1916, to parents of mixed Russian and Turkish extraction, France Gourdji -- as she was then called -- began working at 16 as a stenographer and then became a script-girl for several French movie directors, including Marc Allégret and Jean Renoir. During World War II, she worked as a go-between for the French Resistance, but was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943 and imprisoned at Fresnes until liberation the following year.         After the war, she began her journalistic career in the monthly magazine Elle, rising quickly to the position of news editor. Then, in 1953, with Jean-Jacques Servan-Shreiber, she founded L'Express, France's first American-style news weekly, and served as its news editor and later as editor. One measure of its influence is that the founding editors of its two competitors today, Le Nouvel Observateur and Le Point, came from L'Express.         During the 1950's, Ms. Giroud was married briefly and had two children. She is survived by her daughter, Caroline Eliacheff.         In 1974, during the center-right presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, she was named to the new post of minister of women's affairs by Jacques Chirac, who was prime minister at the time. She moved to the culture minister's job and held it until the following year.         In 1981, her own political views moved to the left: rather than backing either Mr. Giscard d'Estaing or Mr. Chirac, she endorsed the Socialist candidate, François Mitterrand, in his successful effort to win the presidency.         Ms. Giroud never returned to politics, but her weight as a commentator gave her considerable political influence. She also became a prolific author of biographies, including those of Marie Curie and Alma Mahler, and of books of political and personal reflection. In one of her first, ''The Comedy of Power'' (1977), she recounted her experience in government. In 1997, she published her autobiography and, in 2001, a collection of essays, ''Profession Journalist.''         Only one of her books, ''Si Je Mens,'' was published in the United States, in 1974, as ''I Give You My Word'' (Harcourt), but it is no longer in print.         Her books had a loyal readership in France, not least because they were packed with well-aimed commentaries on life.         ''God, how the French love rules,'' she noted in one book, ''The Rumor of the World.'' ''They put them everywhere, even where they have no place: in literature.''         In ''Journal of a Parisian,'' she offered, ''Indifference is an ailment of the spirit and the heart.'' In the same book, she concluded: ''Youth is short. It is life that is long.''       
         Irene Diamond, who after a successful career scouting scripts and talent in Hollywood became a major benefactor of the arts and medical research in New York City, died Tuesday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 92.         At her death, she was president of the Irene Diamond Fund, which she established in 1994 to support, in particular, the performing arts and the fight against AIDS. The fund succeeded the Aaron Diamond Foundation, which she and her husband, a New York real estate developer, set up in the 1950's.         In the 1980's, the couple took an innovative step, deciding to pay out that foundation's considerable wealth over 10 years. They made the decision just before Aaron Diamond, developer of Roosevelt Island, died in 1984. (She liked to say that at the time they married, however, she made more money than her husband.)         Mrs. Diamond remained in control of the foundation after his death. Over the next decade, as planned, she oversaw the distribution of $220 million in about 700 donations, with more than $50 million earmarked for the fight against AIDS.         Among the foundation's top priorities was the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center for the City of New York, affiliated with Rockefeller University. There, in a laboratory building facing Bellevue Hospital Center, its director, Dr. David D. Ho, made crucial discoveries about the immune system's struggle with the AIDS virus.         Through her own fund, Mrs. Diamond invested heavily in New York institutions like Lincoln Center. Recent gifts include $1.2 million for Jazz at Lincoln Center's new home, now being built at the former Coliseum site, and large grants for the Dance Theater of Harlem, New York City Ballet and the New York Public Library.         She aided causes like gun control and AIDS programs in the public schools and gave $10 million to the Juilliard School for a program to attract gifted minority students and teachers.         President Bill Clinton recognized her philanthropy in 1999 with the National Medal of Arts, and in 2001 she received the Andrew Carnegie Medal of Philanthropy. She also sat on the boards of Young Concert Artists, the Film Society of Lincoln Center and Human Rights Watch.         Irene Levine was born to immigrant parents in Pittsburgh, where she attended public schools. Hoping to be an actor, she took the name Irene Lee and studied repertory theater in Manhattan.         She did some modeling and freelance reading for Warner Brothers in New York before getting a job in Hollywood as an assistant editor in the studio's story division. At a meeting with the producer Hal B. Wallis, she began a 25-year collaboration in which she made recommendations on the work of as many as 32 writers. Some of the scripts that crossed her desk became classics, like ''The Maltese Falcon'' and ''Dark Victory.''         In 1941, back in New York, she read an unproduced play, ''Everybody Comes to Rick's,'' by Murray Burnett and Joan Alison. It came with several rejection slips, but its theme of the tough but idealistic American and his bar in Morocco seemed to her a perfect fit for the world news of the day.         She persuaded Mr. Wallis to let her buy the play for $20,000 -- he gave it the name ''Casablanca'' -- and the movie, starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman, came out in 1943. It was just in time for the Allied invasion of North Africa and the Casablanca Conference of Roosevelt and Churchill.         After her marriage to Mr. Diamond in 1942, she continued to work in show business, back in New York. After a brief stint working for the producer Sam Goldwyn, she again worked with Mr. Wallis at Paramount Pictures as a story editor and was head of the talent division until 1970.         She was involved with films like ''Sorry, Wrong Number,'' with Barbara Stanwyck, and ''Come Back, Little Sheba,'' with Shirley Booth. She met and furthered the careers of actors like Burt Lancaster, Kirk Douglas and Robert Redford.         Mrs. Diamond is survived by a daughter, Jean, and two grandsons.         Speaking about ''Casablanca'' and her charitable priorities, she liked to say that ''philanthropy is a lot like Hollywood: you find a good script; you support it.''         Her own Irene Diamond Fund will continue her work, said Jane Silver, its executive director.         Correction:  February 15, 2003, Saturday  An obituary on Jan. 23 about Irene Diamond, a philanthropist who had an earlier career scouting Hollywood film scripts, including one that became the classic ''Casablanca,'' misstated the year of that film's release. It was 1942, not 1943.       
         Sarah Pettit, a founding editor and former editor in chief of Out magazine, one of the first gay and lesbian publications with mainstream status, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 36. The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, her family said.         While attending Yale, where she received a bachelor of arts degree in 1988, she organized gay and lesbian cultural and political events. She moved to New York, and in 1989 became an editor of OutWeek, an alternative paper eager to bring a gay subculture to the surface.         In 1992, she joined Michael Goff in creating Out magazine, where she extended the magazine's cultural and political focus, and attracted a range of advertisers, including Calvin Klein and General Motors, that had not previously appeared in gay publications.         She became editor in chief in 1997 as Out magazine became one of the country's most influential gay and lesbian magazines. She was dismissed at the end of the year on the basis that the magazine wanted to change editorial focus. She sued, asserting sex discrimination and breach of contract. The case was settled out of court.         At her death, she was the senior editor of the Arts and Entertainment section at Newsweek magazine.         Ms. Pettit was born on Aug. 6, 1966, in Amsterdam, where her father, Frederick Pettit, was a banker. She spent her childhood in Paris; London; Bad Homburg, Germany; and Chappaqua, N.Y.         Besides her father, of Hillsborough, Calif., Ms. Pettit is survived by her mother, Jane Pettit of Washington, and two brothers, Benjamin Pettit of Washington and Baer Pettit of London.       
         Celia Stein, a co-founder of The Riverdale Press, died on Jan. 11 at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 90.         Mrs. Stein and her husband, David A. Stein, who died in 1982, founded The Press in their living room in 1950 as a weekly community newsletter, and she remained a member of its management until her death. She also contributed a chronicle of community events and a recipe column, Ceil Selects.         Family-run, The Press now has a paid circulation of about 13,000. It won a 1998 Pulitzer Prize for editorials about schools and other local issues, written by its editor and co-publisher, Mrs. Stein's son Bernard L. Stein.         Celia Leikind was born in Cleveland and graduated from Case Western Reserve University. She came to New York in 1944 with her husband. At the paper, she advanced from society editor to women's editor to co-publisher.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Stein's survivors include another son, Richard L., co-publisher of The Press; three grandchildren; and a great-granddaughter.       
         Mary Brian, a film star and memorable ingénue who bridged the silent and early sound eras, died on Monday in Del Mar, Calif. She was 96 and lived in Los Angeles.         Between ''Peter Pan'' in 1924 and ''Dragnet'' in 1947 Ms. Brian appeared in 82 films. Petite, with blue-gray eyes and dark-brown curls, she was one of Hollywood's romantic leading ladies from the mid-1920's through the late 30's.         While she did not rank with superstars like Clara Bow or Mary Pickford, she was a bankable contract player and a gratifying attraction at the box office. Her leading men were the likes of Gary Cooper, Lew Ayres, James Cagney, Cary Grant, William Haines, Warner Oland and Dick Powell.         Among her films still shown at film festivals and on television are ''Peter Pan'' and one of the earliest western talkies, ''The Virginian,'' from 1929, with Cooper as the title character and Walter Huston as the villain.         In that film Ms. Brian portrayed Molly Wood, a schoolteacher who is the Virginian's romantic interest. In his review in The New York Times, Mordaunt Hall wrote that there was good humor in Medicine Bow when ''the lass from the East clashes with the lads from the West,'' adding that Ms. Brian helped the picture along, although ''she might have been more persuasive with less rouge on her lips.''         The review also said that ''the sounds, whether footfalls, horses' hoofs, rumbling wheels or voices, are really remarkably recorded and reproduced,'' and noted that movie depictions of life in the Wild West were ''aided immeasurably by the audibility of the screen.''         Ms. Brian was born Louise Byrdie Dantzler in Corsicana, Tex. After the family's move to Long Beach, Calif., she entered a beauty contest -- and though she did not win a prize, Paramount invited her to audition for a child's part in its film version of ''Peter Pan.''         The director, Herbert Brenon, cast the young Louise as Wendy. The studio gave her a new name, Mary Brian, and pared her age to 16, deeming 18 too grown up for the part. (After that, Ms. Brian kept her real age to herself, calling it ''negotiable.'')         She remained under contract to Paramount until 1932, appearing in more than 40 of its productions. She showed her mettle as juvenile lead or co-star in ''Beau Geste'' (1926), another Brenon film, and in ''Behind the Front'' (1926), ''Harold Teen'' (1926) and ''River of Romance'' (1929).         Easily navigating the changeover to sound, she appeared in two 1931 evergreens, George Cukor's ''Royal Family of Broadway'' and Lewis Milestone's ''Front Page.''         She played W. C. Fields's daughter in several films, including ''The Man on the Flying Trapeze'' (1935). Working with him she developed a knack for playing the straight woman in comedy, which came in handy later in her career.         Among her other movies of the 1930's were ''Shadows of Sing Sing,'' ''College Rhythm,'' ''Charlie Chan in Paris'' and ''Navy Blues.'' She appeared as herself in ''Hollywood on Parade No. 9'' (1933) and ''Star Night at the Cocoanut Grove'' (1934).         She took to the stage in vaudeville productions at the Palace Theater in New York in 1932 and toured in the 1940's with Edmund Lowe in a farce, ''Mary Had a Little . . .''         Ms. Brian said she gained a new perspective on life during World War II when she entertained troops, venturing closer to the front lines in Europe than most headliners. She spent Christmas 1944 with the soldiers fighting the Battle of the Bulge.         She ended her movie career after the war with ''Dragnet,'' but continued to make occasional television appearances.         In 1947 Ms. Brian married George Tomasini, a Hollywood film editor; he died in 1964.         She is survived by her godson, Stuart Erwin Jr., of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.       
         Amy Bess Williams Miller, who helped found Hancock Shaker Village, a restoration of a former Shaker community and a museum, died on Sunday at her home in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 90.         Mrs. Miller, an expert on the Shaker religious movement, was president of Hancock Shaker Village Inc. from 1959 to 1990. The museum and historic site on the border between Pittsfield and Hancock contains many pieces of Shaker handiwork, including Shaker furniture that Mrs. Miller donated.         She also raised funds and directed the restoration of the site, which had been a Shaker community for a century. The Shaker movement, named for the pious trembling of its members, began in 1747 in Britain as a celibate offshoot of the Quakers.         She began her work shortly before the Shakers ended the settlement in 1960, a century after Shakerism had begun to decline, leaving behind more than 12 buildings. At one time, it appeared that a nearby racetrack would acquire the buildings. But a group of Pittsfielders bought them from the remaining Shakers.         Mrs. Miller's writings include ''Shaker Medicinal Herbs: A Compendium of History, Lore, and Uses'' (1998, Storey in association with Hancock Shaker Village).         A doctor's daughter, Amy Bess Williams was born in El Paso and grew up in Worcester, Mass. She graduated from Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield and studied at the Sorbonne.         Her husband, Lawrence K. Miller, who was editor and publisher of The Berkshire Eagle in Pittsfield, died in 1991, after 58 years of marriage,         Her survivors include a daughter, Margo Miller of Boston; three sons, Kelton II, of Shaftsbury, Vt., and Michael and Mark, both of Pittsfield; a sister, Margery Adams of Charlotte, N.C.; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Sylvia K. Burack, a retired editor and publisher of a magazine that offered advice to budding writers, died on Feb. 14 in Boston. She was 86 and lived in Brookline, Mass.         For nearly 40 years Ms. Burack and her husband, A. S. Burack, published The Writer, as well as another magazine called Plays and how-to books on writing. Early contributors included Isaac Asimov and Phyllis A. Whitney. ''She was the first one who paid any attention to me,'' Ms. Whitney said.         After Mr. Burack's death in 1978, his wife took over as editor and publisher. ''We're not going to make anyone a Pulitzer Prize winner,'' Ms. Burack told The Boston Globe in 1987. ''But we can tell writers about the basics -- the dos and don'ts.''         Authors like Sue Grafton and Stephen King contributed articles about the writing life, on subjects as diverse as writer's block and the secrets of romantic conflict. After reading the magazine, Sidney Sheldon sent Ms. Burack a congratulatory letter, ''and she asked me to write, so I started writing,'' he recalled. Mr. Sheldon contributed an advice column for about five years.         Born in Hartford, Ms. Burack graduated from Smith College in 1938. She served as a trustee for the Massachusetts state college system and the University of Massachusetts and was president of the Friends of Boston University Libraries. She retired from The Writer in 2000 and sold the company to Kalmbach Publishing, which continues to publish the magazines and related books. She is survived by three daughters, Ellen Toker of Pittsburgh; Elizabeth Chapman of Palo Alto, Calif.; and Susan Finer of Hanover, N.H.; and nine grandchildren.         Not all contributors to Ms. Burack's magazine were well known. Wendy Dager, a columnist for The Ventura County Star and self-published author of ''The Gorgeous and Brilliant Guide to Freelance Writing,'' wrote an article on creating greeting cards. Ms. Burack sent her a personal acceptance letter, ''typed on a typewriter, with Wite-Out and all,'' Ms. Dager said. ''She and The Writer treated us lesser-known writers as if we were just as important as those with household names.''       
         Erika Fromm, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Chicago and an expert on the use of hypnosis in therapy, died on Monday at her home in Chicago. She was 93.         Dr. Fromm considered hypnosis a valuable analytical tool that, when used by a skilled practitioner, could provide access to a patient's unconscious conflicts and desires. She said hypnosis could induce an altered state of consciousness involving heightened awareness and focus in approximately 1 in 12 people.         She used hypnosis to treat severely disturbed patients as well as victims of incest and those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders. She also advocated self-hypnosis as a path to self-exploration.         In the 1980's, Dr. Fromm joined the growing field of behavioral medicine, which uses hypnosis, meditation, biofeedback and other techniques to treat physical ailments. Her book ''Hypnosis and Behavioral Medicine,'' written with Dr. Daniel P. Brown and published in 1987, presented research supporting those methods in treating allergies, asthma, migraines and hypertension.         She was the longtime editor of the journal Research Developments and Perspectives in Hypnosis. Her books include ''Dream Interpretation: A New Approach'' (1964), written with Dr. Thomas French; ''Hypnotherapy and Hypnoanalysis'' (1986), written with Dr. Brown; and ''Self-Hypnosis: The Chicago Paradigm'' (1990), written with Dr. Stephen Kahn. Her final book, ''Changes in the Therapist'' (2000), also written with Dr. Kahn, looked at the impact that patients can have on their therapists.         Born Erika Oppenheimer in Frankfurt, Germany, on Dec. 23, 1909, she received her doctorate in psychology from the University of Frankfurt in 1933. Alarmed by Nazism, she moved to the Netherlands that year and to the United States in 1938. She was a research assistant in psychiatry at the University of Chicago from 1939 to 1940, then spent years in practice and joined the university's faculty in 1961.         Her husband was Paul Fromm, a cousin of the psychoanalyst Erich Fromm and the founder of the Fromm Music Foundation at Harvard, which supports contemporary composers. He died in 1987. Her daughter, Joan Fromm Greenstone, died in 1996. She is survived by a sister, Clementina Kro of Israel; three brothers, Walter Oppenheimer of Germany, Asher Oppenheimer of Israel and John Ormond of Piedmont, Calif.; two grandsons; and two great-grandsons.       
         Suzy Parker, the willowy, red-headed beauty whose elegant poses on scores of magazine covers defined glamour in the 1950's and paved the way for the supermodels to follow, died on Saturday at her home in Montecito, Calif. She was 69.         Her husband, the actor Bradford Dillman, said she had suffered from a number of serious ailments over the last six years.         In the period just after World War II, models were becoming celebrities. Fashion's influence was inexorably expanding from high society to society at large, and Suzy Parker, along with other models like Dovima and Lisa Fonssagrives, signified a postwar world of stylish promise for all. When Miss Parker posed in one of fashion's first bikini shots, America noticed.         Miss Parker was the first model to make more than $100 an hour and $100,000 a year, said Eileen Ford, the doyenne of modeling agents. She also worked as a professional photographer and editor, and she appeared in lead roles in movies with Cary Grant and Gary Cooper.         Ms. Ford said she was simply staggered when the famed model Dorian Leigh, Miss Parker's oldest sister, introduced her to Suzy, then 15.         ''She was the most beautiful creature you can imagine,'' Ms. Ford said. ''She was everybody's everything.''         Miss Parker's trademark in photographs and later on the movie screen was icy sophistication, often likened to that of Grace Kelly, but in person she exuded a girl-next-door prettiness and a sort of wacky loquaciousness. Audrey Hepburn's role in ''Funny Face,'' as a fast-talking beatnik who somewhat unwillingly becomes a world-famous model, was inspired by her, and she made a cameo appearance in the film, her first movie role.         Miss Parker adored slouch hats of the sort favored by Garbo and collected Coco Chanel's classic designs for herself. Richard Avedon, the photographer, called her ''my most challenging and complicated of muses.''         Cecilia Ann Renee Parker was born in San Antonio on Oct. 28, 1933. While still in high school in Jacksonville, Fla., she modeled in the summers for Ford Models, and after graduation went to work full time for the agency. In a silent profession Miss Parker was outspoken.         ''Suzy Parker didn't stop talking when I first tried to take her picture,'' Horst, the photographer, said. ''I said, 'You keep talking,' and I left. When she got into the movies, I joked that maybe she would do for the movies what she would never do for me -- hold still.''         She publicly condemned drinking and smoking and said marriage killed romance. The New York Daily News reported her lecturing a French economist about the French economy. She said she talked too much for most men.         Her often-quoted remark that she could love a man more when she was not married to him exploded in headlines when it turned out she was secretly married.         That marriage, to Pierre de la Salle in 1958, was actually her second; she had been briefly married to a high school sweetheart. She and Mr. de la Salle, from whom she was later divorced, had a daughter, Georgia, of Paris, who survives her.         In 1963 she married Mr. Dillman, who survives her, along with their daughter, Dinah Kaufman of Irvine, Calif.; their sons Charles, of Los Angeles, and Christopher, of Encinitas, Calif.; and four grandchildren.         Her sisters Dorian Leigh of Paris and Florian Boice of Annapolis, Md., also survive her.         Miss Parker said she looked in the mirror each day and thanked God for her cheekbones. But she insisted that she modeled only for money and had other professional ambitions. In the mid-1950's she temporarily abandoned being a cover girl for several years to be a photographer herself, apprenticing with Henri Cartier-Bresson in Paris and working for the French edition of Vogue.         It was through Mr. Avedon that Miss Parker parlayed her modeling fame into a movie career. As visual consultant in the movie ''Funny Face,'' Mr. Avedon selected her for a brief but conspicuous appearance. Written by Leonard Gershe and directed by Stanley Donen, the 1957 film depicted a high-fashion photographer not unlike Mr. Avedon, played by Fred Astaire. Miss Parker was the inspiration for Audrey Hepburn's character in the film, a somewhat kooky intellectual and free spirit.         Hepburn, in turn, became such a cheerleader that Miss Parker called the actress her ''Hollywood press agent.''         Miss Parker was cast opposite Cary Grant in ''Kiss Them for Me'' in 1957, getting bad reviews. She appeared with Gary Cooper the next year in ''Ten North Frederick.'' This time, Bosley Crowther in The New York Times said she underplayed her part ''neatly.''         She appeared in 1959 in ''The Best of Everything,'' based on Rona Jaffe's novel. In 1961 she played opposite Mr. Dillman in ''A Circle of Deception.'' They wed in 1963.         Miss Parker was in several more movies and became a sought-after television guest in the 1960's. Her most famous television appearance was in a 1963 episode of ''Twilight Zone'' in which she played six different parts.         She retired from acting in the mid-1960's and moved with Mr. Dillman to the Santa Barbara area.         In his book ''Cover Girls and Supermodels, 1945-1965'' (Marion Boyars, 1996), the French journalist Jean-Noël Liaut said Miss Parker had escaped the unhappy outcomes of other stellar models.         He wrote, ''She became a perfect housewife, even to the extent of baking her own bread.''       
         Sara Ann Freed, an award-winning editor of crime fiction, died on Wednesday. She was 57 and lived in New York City.         She had been under treatment for leukemia, Warner Books said in a statement announcing her death.         She was editor in chief of Mysterious Press and senior editor at Warner Books, which are both imprints of the AOL Time Warner Book Group. Among the writers she edited are Marcia Muller, Margaret Maron, James Patterson, Kate White, Ed Dee, David Rosenfelt, James Siegel, Robert Greer, Kelly Lange and Michael Walsh. In 1999 the Mystery Writers of America gave her an Ellery Queen Award, which honors distinguished people in the mystery-publishing business.         In 1988 Patricia Cornwell, now a well-known crime writer, was advised privately by Ms. Freed to make Dr. Kay Scarpetta, a fictional medical examiner, the chief character in the book that Ms. Cornwell was writing. The book, ''Postmortem,'' had been rejected by several publishing houses, but it was a success with the public when it came out in 1990. And Kay Scarpetta loomed large in subsequent Cornwell crime novels.         A native of Souderton, Pa., Ms. Freed got her start in publishing by working for a small religious publishing house. Later she moved to New York City, where she worked for various publishers before she joined Mysterious Press as a manuscript reader in 1985.         She is survived by her husband, Ira Weissman; a stepson, Michael; four brothers; and a sister.       
         Elizabeth Fowler, who wrote a harrowing book about being the only woman among 35 passengers on a lifeboat in the Atlantic Ocean for 10 days during World War II, died on May 30 at a convalescent home in West Orange, N.J. She was 95.         On an autumn evening in 1942 she was in her early thirties and had finagled passage on a cargo ship from Africa to escape a troubled marriage and join her young daughter in Connecticut. She was knitting when a German U-boat torpedoed the ship.         Ms. Fowler endured pounding rain, hunger, excruciating thirst, frigid waves and circling sharks as she and her desperate companions bobbed through an intense human drama in a very small space. The episode, as described in news reports, columns and magazine articles, sounds very much like the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 movie ''Lifeboat.'' But there appears to be no direct link. Ms. Fowler's book, ''Standing Room Only'' (Dodd, Mead) was published the same year the movie was released.         Lucy Greenbaum in The New York Times Book Review called Ms. Fowler's account ''a tight, terse tale of war drama where each swell of a wave is matched by the surge of a human emotion.''         The Saturday Review of Literature called the book ''almost unbearable reading at times,'' but said that its directness and vividness made it impossible to put down.         For 35 years, until recently, Ms. Fowler lived in Montclair, N.J., and her saga only gradually became known to friends she met at the local Y.M.C.A. She was a legend there for her daily exercise regimen: swimming 18 laps and doing 36 pull-ups on the diving board well into her 90's. In her 80's, she was still putt-putting around town on a motor scooter.         As Ms. Fowler intermittently spun out the story of her life, friends in the Y's steam room at first thought it implausible.         ''We all thought she was exaggerating,'' Elizabeth Crann she said. ''She was never exaggerating.''         Elizabeth Japp was born in the United States on March 13, 1908, said Ms. Crann, who interviewed her about her life. Miss Japp's father was Sir Henry Japp, a British engineer who built the rail tunnels under the East River. A profile of Sir Henry by The New York Times in 1906 called him ''the wizard.''         In her book, Ms. Fowler, who had both American and British citizenship, said the family moved back to England when she was 12. She attended English schools and then went to study music in Paris, where someone burst into one of her lessons and demanded that the master hear two children. One was the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who immediately became a pupil.         While in France, Miss Japp became engaged to an English businessman who died in a plane crash when she was 21. She returned to New York.         At some point she met Frank Fowler, a physician who worked on the Gold Coast for the Colonial Medical Service. They left their only daughter, Niccie, in England. After German bombing began, they sent her to live in Connecticut. After strains in her marriage, Ms. Fowler talked her way onto the West Kebar, a ship carrying palm oil from what is now Ghana to New York.         She was the only woman on board, and wrote that the men resented her because they believed she could not pull her weight. German submarines had been attacking many merchant ships, but Ms. Fowler on a pleasant evening was relaxing on deck, knitting. Suddenly, the captain screamed, ''This is it!''         Thirty-five people ended up in a 26-foot lifeboat, a self-contained universe of fear, boredom and oddity. Ms. Fowler wrote of trying to evade a man intent on kissing her, and how she finally managed to urinate in a bucket. Repeatedly and inexplicably, she wrote, she mourned the Burberry coat she had lost.         Mostly she told of her boat mates and their interaction. ''Human decency showed more brightly with some,'' she wrote. ''That was all -- but that was everything too.''         The lifeboat was finally spotted from land, off the coast of Barbados. After they were rescued, she worked as a nanny in Connecticut but was also something of a celebrity. Lord & Taylor displayed her bedraggled dress from the lifeboat in its window, and women's magazines profiled her. The columnist Elsa Maxwell wrote that she ''has had more emotional experiences out of this war than any other human being I know.''         Ms. Fowler, as a result, always thought she was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 movie, although her book was a published a month after the release of ''Lifeboat.'' John Steinbeck, who wrote the novella and the screen treatment that became ''Lifeboat,'' does not seem to have mentioned her experience.         But there is no question that her story was in the public eye, and when Ms. Fowler later met the movie's star, Tallulah Bankhead, Miss Bankhead said, ''So I was supposed to be you,'' a comment Ms. Fowler did not take as flattering.         For many years, Ms. Fowler worked as an editor for book and magazine publishers. She is survived by her daughter, Niccie Sesson of England, and a grandson, Ms. Crann said.         She treasured a piece of the lifeboat's sail her companions had given her. ''To a good shipmate,'' it said.       
         Anne Belle, a documentary filmmaker who specialized in portraits of New York City Ballet dancers, died last Wednesday at her daughter's home in Los Angeles. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan and Remsenberg, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said Catherine Tambini, a friend and colleague.         Ms. Belle's two earliest films, ''Baymen -- Our Waters Are Dying,'' about the clam diggers of eastern Long Island, and ''Henry,'' about an independent old man living on a barge on the Hudson River, were shown on PBS. She later produced a trilogy of dance films about Suzanne Farrell, Alexandra Danilova and six ballerinas who worked with George Balanchine. The 1996 film ''Suzanne Farrell: Elusive Muse,'' an Academy Award nominee that she directed with Deborah Dickson, was a revealing portrait of a reticent young ballerina, Balanchine's last great inspiration, whom the choreographer loved deeply but failed to win off stage.         Ms. Belle captured all of the gaiety and pragmatism of Danilova, prima ballerina of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1938 to 1952, in her 1987 documentary ''Reflections of a Dancer: Alexandra Danilova.''         ''Dancing for Mr. B: Six Balanchine Ballerinas,'' a 1989 documentary that Ms. Belle directed with Ms. Dickson, had affectionate portrayals of the choreographer and the ballerinas Maria Tallchief, Mary Ellen Moylan, Melissa Hayden, Allegra Kent, Merrill Ashley and Darci Kistler.         At her death, Ms. Belle was working on a documentary on Stanley Williams, a teacher at the New York City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet, and had an option to film the book ''Passionate Nomad'' by Jane Fletcher Geniesse, a biography of the explorer Freya Stark.         Born in Chile, she grew up in Canada, Morocco and England and studied ballet in London before moving to New York City. She worked for a time in New York as a freelance writer and an editor at House & Garden magazine. She received a master of fine arts degree from the New York University Graduate Institute of Film and Television in 1968.         Ms. Belle also produced, directed and edited several short films for the Children's Television Workshop. Her films have been shown at the Sundance and New York Dance Films Festival and at festivals in Berlin, Montreal, Chicago, Leningrad, Melbourne and Sydney.         In addition to her daughter, Antonia, of Los Angeles, Ms. Belle is survived by her husband, John Belle, partner in the architectural firm of Beyer, Blinder, Belle; her brother Michael Stagg of Oakland, Calif.; her son, David, of New York City; her stepchildren, Sebastian, of Augusta, Me., Fenella of Charlottesville, Va., and Amelia, of Sonoma, Calif.; and six grandchildren.       
         Gladys Heldman, an instrumental figure in the formation of women's professional tennis, died Sunday at her home in Sante Fe, N.M. She was 81.         The Sante Fe Police Department reported that Ms. Heldman died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The police report said she had been experiencing health difficulties.         Ms. Heldman, the founder, publisher and editor of World Tennis magazine, began playing tennis at age 25. As an amateur, she was ranked No. 1 in Texas. She competed in the United States National Championships four times and at Wimbledon in 1954.         Off the court, Ms. Heldman was an indomitable force. She started World Tennis magazine in 1953 as a forum for the sport's views and problems. During its early years, the magazine was a one-woman operation, with Ms. Heldman as editor in chief, layout editor, art director and advertising director. She sold the magazine to CBS Publications in 1972.         The magazine helped transform Ms. Heldman into an advocate for women's tennis and one of the most influential people in the game.         In 1970, she used her status to help nine of the top women's players, led by Billie Jean King and Rosie Casals, form their own pro tour.         She arranged for the Houston Racquet Club to sponsor a tournament and had nearly all the players in the group sign $1 contracts with World Tennis to play in the tournament. Heldman persuaded her friend Joseph Cullman, chairman of Philip Morris, to donate prize money and sponsor five tournaments.         Despite suspensions and economic sanctions, the women's pro tour evolved into the Virginia Slims tour.         ''Without Gladys, there wouldn't be women's professional tennis,'' King said in a statement Monday. ''When I accepted that $1 contract from Gladys more than 30 years ago, I knew we were all part of something special and that women's tennis had been changed forever because of her vision.''         Gladys Medalie Heldman was born May 13, 1922, in New York City. Her father, George Z. Medalie, was a New York lawyer and judge. A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Stanford University, she married Julius Heldman, a former United States junior tennis champion, in 1942.         The Heldmans' daughters, Carrie and Julie, were accomplished players; Julie was ranked as high as No. 5 in the world in 1969 and 1974.         Ms. Heldman was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1979. She is survived by her husband, her daughters and three grandchildren.       
         Leela Chitnis, an actress whose half-century-long 40-film career in India progressed from romantic roles to the motherly ones for which she is best remembered, died on Monday at a hospital in Danbury, Conn. She was 93. She had been living in Connecticut for many years to be near her family.         Ms. Chitnis began her acting career onstage at a time women seldom worked as actors. Her son Manavedra Chitnis said that women who did act were regarded as prostitutes, and so Ms. Chitnis was shunned by Brahmans, the priestly caste of which she was a member.         She did not care, her son said, nor was she abashed by these prejudices when she moved on, in the 1930's, to India's large and lively movie industry in Bombay, now known as Bollywood. She began playing romantic leads and became one of the best-known heroines in the country.         From 1948 into the 1980's, she worked as a character actor, becoming famous in the 1950's and 60's for her portrayals of mothers. In these roles, she developed an image of sober probity, underlined by gold-rimmed glasses and white saris.         ''Whenever I think of her, I still shake with awe,'' said Jyotirmoy Datta, the senior arts editor for News-India Times, an English-language weekly published in New York. ''She seemed to be always right and prepared to follow the straight path of virtue.''         In a review of her work in 1997 in India-West magazine, published in Emeryville, Calif., R. M. Vijayakar called Ms. Chitnis the Duchess of Depression, not least because of her characteristic cough.         ''If she appeared on screen it was to cough consumptively, gobble spoonfuls of syrup from bottles perched so precariously on bedside tables that they overturned and crashed to the floor when there was no money to buy another,'' he wrote.         Ms. Chitnis was born on Sept. 9, 1909, in a small town near Bombay. Her father was an English professor who adhered to Brahmo Samaj, a religious movement that rejected caste.         She married a much older man at 15 or 16, and quickly had four children. The couple supported India's struggle for independence from Britain and once risked arrest by harboring Manabendra Nath Roy, a Marxist freedom fighter.         After they divorced, she worked as a schoolteacher and began acting onstage in melodramas typical of the time. She appeared in several movies, and went through a Bombay university in order to be hired by a major studio, Bombay Talkies; it hired only college graduates.         She soon made three hit films -- ''Kangan,'' ''Bandhan'' and ''Jhoola'' -- with Ashok Kumar, who became one of India's top male stars. In a much-remembered scene in ''Kangan'' (1939), she overhears the playwright with whom she is in love declaring his love to another woman -- unaware that he is reading lines from his latest play. The Hindustan Times, in its obituary, said her acting in the movie ''epitomized rustic beauty in mainstream Hindi cinema.''         Ms. Chitnis began playing mothers in 1948 with the patriotic film ''Shaheed.'' Her best known maternal role, according to The Hindustan Times, was in ''Awaara'' (1951), in which she is deserted by her husband for suspected infidelity.         Her last movie was ''Dil Tujhko Diya,'' in 1985.         For older Indians, Ms. Chitnis is remembered as the first Indian movie star to endorse Lux soap, in 1941. Foreign celebrities had previously been the ones to endorse this and other consumer products.         In addition to her son Manavendra, Ms. Chitnis is survived by her sons Benoy and Raj, and by three grandchildren.       
         Gertrude Samuels, a writer and photographer whose 50-year career took her from the displaced-persons camps of postwar Europe to the blight of drug addiction in America's cities, died Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side. She was 93.         Beginning in the wartime 1940's, she worked as a writer, photographer and editor on the staff of The New York Times Magazine. In 1975, she turned to freelance writing.         Before and after, her byline appeared in many publications, to which she contributed picture essays. She remained a United Nations correspondent for The New Leader magazine until a few years ago.         As a writer, she was at home in genres beyond topical journalism. She produced books for young readers, stage plays and a biography of David Ben-Gurion, along with other writings on Israel.         Miss Samuels was an early practitioner of photojournalism as documentary. She covered national and foreign affairs for The New York Post, Newsweek and Time magazine before she joined the staff of The Times in 1943.         Her pictorial articles also appeared in magazines like National Geographic, Redbook and The Saturday Evening Post. Her reports were broadcast overseas by the United States Information Service.         Gertrude Samuels was born in Manchester, England, and came with her family to Chicago when she was 14. She attended Busch Conservatory of Music there and George Washington University but dropped out to join the staff of The New York Post in 1937.         She returned to the classroom years later, after leaving The Times. She received a B.A. in English literature at N.Y.U. in 1982; she earned a master's degree one year later.         At The Times, in 1943, she wrote news summaries for the Week in Review before The Times Magazine assigned her to cover events nationally and abroad.         She toured displaced-persons camps in Europe, traveled the Middle East reporting on the birth of Israel and the refugees in the region, and, in the early 1950's, contributed magazine articles from Southeast Asia, North Africa and Korea. On the home front, she told readers about the racial unrest attending school desegregation in the South, juvenile delinquency in the inner cities and drug addiction.         Her work was recognized with photography awards and a 1955 George Polk Award, among others.         ''B-G: Fighter of Goliaths; The Story of David Ben-Gurion'' (Crowell, 1961; rev. ed. 1974) included her own photographs from Israel, as did ''The Secret of Gonen: Portrait of a Kibbutz on the Border in a Time of War'' (Avon, 1969).         Her other books included ''The People vs. Baby: A Documentary Novel'' (Doubleday, 1967); ''Run, Shelley, Run!'' (Crowell, 1974); ''Mottele: A Partisan Odyssey'' (Harper, 1976); ''Adam's Daughter'' (Crowell, 1977); ''Of David and Eva: A Love Story'' (New American Library, 1978); and ''Yours, Brett'' (Lodestar, 1988).         Among her plays were ''The Plant That Talked Back'' and ''Judah the Maccabee and Me,'' both produced at the Lambs Club Theater in 1970.         Miss Samuels is survived by her son, Paul Oppenheimer of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.         Gertrude Samuels is among those featured at an exhibition in the Mugar Library of Boston University in Boston, ''On the Front Line: Women Journalists on War and Politics,'' which opened in January.       
         Josephine Jacobsen, a poet, short-story writer and critic who held the post that later became that of national poet laureate, died on Wednesday in Cockeysville, Md. She was 94 and had lived in Maryland most of her life.         She was consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress from 1971 to 1973; the title was changed to poet laureate consultant in poetry in 1986, the same year Robert Penn Warren was awarded the post. Mrs. Jacobsen's name is on the honor roll of national poets laureate, backdated to 1937, when the consultant's position was created.         Over more than 80 years, her writing braided the physical and spiritual strains of the human experience. Collections of both her poems and prose were published as recently as three years ago.         Mrs. Jacobsen's first poem was printed in a children's magazine when she was 10, but she did not achieve widespread recognition until her 60's and 70's. All the while, her work appeared in nearly every literary or college quarterly that published poetry, as well as in publications like The New Yorker and The New York Times.         She was celebrated for elegant, concise phrasing on a wide range of topics and in varied forms, which she filled with nature and animal imagery. She plumbed questions of identity, interrelatedness and isolation.         In 1993 Mrs. Jacobsen received the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America, and in 1997 its highest award, the Robert Frost Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Poetry. Among other things, the medal honored her legendary generosity in helping younger, struggling poets get their work published, a quality considered rare in her profession.         That aspect of her character came to the fore in 1971, when L. Quincy Mumford, the librarian of Congress, named her consultant in poetry. She was only the fourth woman to receive the honor, and the first in 21 years. Her male predecessors included Robert Frost, Conrad Aiken and, most immediately, William Stafford.         The job had fairly flexible duties, which entailed advising the library on its literary collections, inviting scholars and poets to Washington for readings, and lecturing and reading her own work.         Mrs. Jacobsen, born Josephine Winder Boylan in Cobourg, Ontario, was taken to the United States when she was 3 months old. Privately educated, she graduated from Roland Park Country School in Baltimore in 1926, and in 1932 married Eric Jacobsen.         The couple spent half of each year in New Hampshire, where Mr. Jacobsen, a businessman, liked to garden and play tennis, and Mrs. Jacobsen worked in a little cabin ''down under the trees.''         She gained critical attention with her first publication, ''Let Each Man Remember'' (Kaleidograph, 1940), a collage of 15 love sonnets interspersed with metaphysical love poems. The book, which showed her knack for poetry in a disciplined form, was followed by the intensely personal verses of ''The Human Climate: New Poems'' (Contemporary Poetry, 1953), and ''The Animal Inside'' (Ohio University Press, 1966), which widened her range and touched on subjects of love and death.         Mrs. Jacobsen is survived by a son, Erlend, of Plainfield, Vt.; five grandchildren; and a great-grandson.         She was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1994.         Her books currently in print include ''Distances'' (Press Alley, 1991); ''In the Crevice of Time: New and Collected Poems'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995); ''Instant of Knowing: Lectures, Criticism and Occasional Prose,'' Elizabeth Spires, editor (University of Michigan Press, 2000); ''On the Island: New and Selected Stories'' (Ontario Review Press, 1989); and ''What Goes Without Saying: Collected Stories of Josephine Jacobsen'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000).         Correction:  August 2, 2003, Saturday  An obituary of the poet Josephine Jacobsen on July 12 misstated the name of the publisher of her book ''Distances.'' It is Press of Appletree Alley, not Press Alley.       
         Clare Le Corbeiller, a longtime curator of the decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         She had battled cancer for five years, said her husband, Jean Le Corbeiller.         Mrs. Corbeiller was widely knowledgeable in the decorative arts, specializing in Continental porcelain, metalwork and jewelry (with emphasis on 18th-century French) and Chinese export porcelain. She was also what might be called an old-school curator in that she was trained primarily through direct contact with objects, although she attended lectures in art history by Seymour Slive and Wolfgang Stechow during two years spent studying piano at Oberlin College.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller was born of American parents in 1931 in Cambridge, England, where her father was studying history. She grew up in Cleveland and in New York, where her mother worked at the Museum of Modern Art and as an editor at Lincoln Kirstein's magazine Dance Index.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller came to the Met as a summer volunteer in 1952 while studying advertising design at the Rhode Island School of Design. Except for a six-year absence in the early 1960's, when her two daughters were in the sandbox stage, she never left. She joined the museum's central cataloging department in 1953 and when that department was dissolved in 1959 -- an event that she saw as unfortunate -- she moved to the decorative arts department, known today as European Sculpture and Decorative Arts.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller's career both paralleled and contributed to the rise in prominence of the Met's European decorative arts holdings during the last 35 years. She was involved at all levels, micro to macro.         She systematized both the department's storage and its files, oversaw the installation of permanent galleries and period rooms, contributed to major exhibitions like ''The Arts Under Napoleon'' (1978) and guided acquisitions. With James Parker, she wrote the guide to the museum's Wrightsman Galleries (1979), the complex of spaces that display Jane Wrightsman's immense gift of French decorative arts; she also wrote the catalog for the gold boxes included in the gift (1977). She selected the porcelains for the museum's Jack and Belle Linsky Collection and also wrote its catalog (1984). With Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen she organized ''Chinese Export Porcelain'' at the Met in 2003 and wrote its catalog, published as the Winter 2003 issue of the museum's bulletin.         In addition, Mrs. Le Corbeiller published regularly in magazines like Apollo and taught in the Parsons/Cooper-Hewitt master's program and the Bard Graduate Center.         After her child-rearing hiatus, during which she wrote a book on American and European snuffboxes, Mrs. Le Corbeiller returned to the Met as an assistant curator in 1967, rising to full curator in 1991. She was named curator emerita upon her retirement in 2000. In her honor, the Met turned an issue of its annual Journal into a 319-page Festschrift; it contained essays by 28 colleagues from the museum and elsewhere, an in-house record in terms of contributors.         In addition to her husband, a teacher of mathematics and the history of science whom she married in 1958, Mrs. Le Corbeiller is survived two daughters, Suzanne Le Corbeiller of Pocatello, Idaho, and Geneviéve White of Pelham, N.Y., and four grandchildren.         Correction:  December 1, 2003, Monday  An obituary last Monday about Clare Le Corbeiller, a longtime curator of decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, misspelled the given name of a donor of French decorative works. She is Jayne Wrightsman, not Jane.       
         Helen Gustafson, a tea buyer and author who championed fine tea, pushed it onto the menu at Chez Panisse and other restaurants and taught the art of the afternoon tea, died on Dec. 14 at her home here. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Clair Gustafson.         She was ''the Alice Waters of the tea movement,'' said a friend, Ruth Reichl, editor in chief of Gourmet magazine and former restaurant critic of The New York Times, in a reference to the founder of Chez Panisse.         Ms. Gustafson was tea's ambassador at a time when diners sipped French roast and other strong coffees but thought tea was limited to Lipton.         Two decades ago ''it was quite impossible to find a good cup of tea anywhere in America,'' James Norwood Pratt, the international tea authority and author, said last week. ''Now, it is only highly unlikely. The difference is Helen Gustafson.''         So many restaurateurs made pilgrimages to Chez Panisse in Berkeley, where Ms. Gustafson managed the tea service, that ''it had a ripple effect,'' Mr. Pratt said.         Ms. Gustafson, the author of ''The Agony of the Leaves: The Ecstasy of My Life with Tea'' and ''The Green Tea User's Manual,'' even organized tea parties in Berkeley, a center of political radicalism, at which she requested that women wear gloves and hats.         ''People who a decade before were chanting 'Two-four-six-eight, organize and smash the state!' would get dressed up and go to Helen's,'' said Kate Coleman, a journalist who was a leader in the Free Speech Movement of 1964.         Ms. Waters credited Ms. Gustafson with taking Chez Panisse's tea offerings ''to a different place,'' but described the relationship as ''rocky to the end.'' Sometimes Ms. Gustafson would awaken dishwashers on Sunday mornings to ask why the iron teapots had not been turned upside down to dry. She was fired several times but always refused to leave, her husband said.         Born in Minneapolis on Nov. 25, 1929, Ms. Gustafson grew up enjoying afternoon tea in the sunroom of her red brick house with her mother and grandmother. She graduated from Syracuse University and received a master's degree in Scandinavian drama from the University of Minnesota.         She swept onto the food scene in the early 1970's when she became a hostess at the Swallow, a restaurant at the University of California Art Museum in Berkeley. ''I had the impression she was running it,'' Ms. Waters said, adding, ''It was a collective.''         When Ms. Gustafson, in vintage clothes and with a gardenia in her hair, began acting as hostess at Chez Panisse, she was so appalled by the Earl Grey on the menu that she confronted Ms. Waters, who gave her license to do something about it. Ms. Gustafson introduced teas like Yunnan, Assam and lemon verbena.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her son, Paul, of Berkeley; a daughter, Jill, of Boston; and a brother, John, of Liverpool, N.Y.         A month before she died, friends gave Ms. Gustafson a final tea party at Chez Panisse. ''I've never seen so many people with thermometers fussing over water and how long it had to be boiled,'' said the general manager, Gilbert Pilgram.       
         Isabelle Stevenson, the president of the American Theater Wing for more than 30 years, its chairwoman for the last five years and one of the best-known figures in the theater world, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan, her daughter Laura said. She was 90.         She was perhaps best known to the public as the doyenne of the Tony Awards, Broadway's equivalent of the Academy Awards and the American theater's most widely recognized prize. The Tony Awards were founded by the Theater Wing in 1947 and named for Antoinette Perry, a former chairwoman who ran the organization during World War II. They are jointly administered by the wing and the League of American Theaters and Producers, the trade association of Broadway theater owners and producers.         The Tony telecast, administered by a Tony Management Committee of five wing and five league representatives, means not only prestige but also money. It is shown each year just before summer vacation time, and the play that wins the Tony almost always enjoys extra tourist dollars. The Theater Wing's share of income from the award broadcast, along with fund-raising events, private contributions and membership fees, also supports its programs.         Mrs. Stevenson was responsible for several major innovations in her long tenure at the wing, which is primarily a service and education organization, building audiences for the stage as well as honoring excellence in the theater.         She inaugurated the series of ''Working in the Theater'' seminars, held twice a year at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York and shown on cable television. The seminars bring together leading performers, playwrights, directors, producers and scenic and costume designers.         She also began a program of grants and fellowships to Off and Off Off Broadway theaters. Theater in Schools, begun under her auspices, sends professionals to high schools to talk about their craft and provides scholarships to high school graduates to further their theater training.         Mrs. Stevenson nurtured other Theater Wing programs, including the Hospital Program, which takes plays and cabaret shows to hospitals, nursing homes and AIDS centers and, for many years, a Theater for Children, which produced plays for thousands of New York public-school students each year. Another program, Introduction to Broadway, provides Broadway theater tickets for $2.50 to high school students in an attempt to develop the audience of the future.         For more than half a century, Tonys have been given only to Broadway plays and performers. For many of those years Mrs. Stevenson pressed for a change in rules that would permit Off Broadway plays to be eligible for Tony Awards. And for years she failed. ''When the Tonys started, there wasn't really any Off Broadway, so the rules said Broadway theaters,'' Mrs. Stevenson said frequently. ''That should be changed now. I think Off Broadway's contribution to the theater should not be ignored.'' At the time of her death, the rules still had not changed.         Mrs. Stevenson was born Isabelle Lubow in Vineland, N.J., on May 15, 1913, the daughter of Sonia Lubow and Samuel Lieberman, who were married but lived separate lives. She and her two sisters took their mother's name. The family moved from Philadelphia to Far Rockaway when she was 10 and, several years later, to Brooklyn.         At 14, to take off weight, she began dance classes in Manhattan and met Harry Foster, a producer from England who was interested in organizing a line of dancers. Young Isabelle was one of the 15 chosen for training. The group was later known as the Foster Girls and was a part of ''Earl Carroll's Vanities.'' She was picked up each night by her mother and taken home on the subway.         When the show was taken on the road, Mrs. Lubow refused to allow her daughter to travel with it. So Isabelle began doing solo dance acts in vaudeville and a short time later, formed an act with two young male dancers. The trio, billed as Nice, Florio and Lubow, played the RKO circuit, including the Palace in New York. They also played Britain and took part in a command performance for Queen Mary and King George V. Mrs. Lubow accompanied her daughter everywhere.         Mrs. Stevenson met her future husband during a booking in Australia. John Stevenson had come out from England and was working on a newspaper in Melbourne. He returned to New York as promotion manager of The New York Post, and they were married in 1937. Mr. Stevenson, later involved in marketing of books and records, died in February 2002.         ''There was no question of my working -- I wasn't Katherine Cornell or Helen Hayes,'' Mrs. Stevenson recalled in a 1997 interview, when asked why she gave up her dancing career. ''I went to the Traphagen School of Design, took dance classes and courses in journalism and then I went to work for my husband as women's editor.'' By then, there were two daughters, as well as her sister's child, whom the Stevensons treated as their own. She is survived by her daughters, Susan Brown of Manhattan and Laura Maslon of Venice, Calif.; her niece and foster daughter, Francine Ringold-Johnson of Tulsa, Okla.; two grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         In 1956 when all the children were in school, Mrs. Stevenson joined the board of the American Theater Wing, and when Helen Menken, then the president, died in 1965, she was elected president. She stepped down to become its chairman in 1998 and the next year was honored at a tribute at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel.         The Theater Wing was known as the Stage Women's War Relief Fund when it was founded in 1917. It was renamed the American Theater Wing War Service Theater in 1939 and was known for its Stage Door Canteens in Manhattan and elsewhere. After the war, the wing established not only the Tonys Awards but also the Professional Training School, a theater school for returning soldiers, which existed from 1946 to 1965.         In 1980 a caricature of Mrs. Stevenson became the 1,000th likeness to join the gallery of theatrical figures at Sardi's Restaurant. In 1999 she received a special Tony Award for lifetime achievement.         ''I stood on the sidelines for half a century and watched other people receive Tony Awards,'' she said, ''and now at last I get my own.''       
         Priscilla Comins Kidder, who rose to prominence as Priscilla of Boston, outfitting young brides as their numbers soared after World War II in embellished dresses that became synonymous with American matrimonial style, died on Sunday at her home in Winchester, Mass. She was 86.         Anticipating a surge in marriages after the war, Mrs. Kidder opened a bridal boutique in 1948 on Newbury Street in Boston. The Bride's Shop, as she called it, was an immediate success, with sales of more than $10,000 in its first week.         Mrs. Kidder's success put her increasingly in contact with the wealthy. Through a friend, Stanley Marcus of Neiman-Marcus, she obtained a storybook assignment in 1956, designing bridesmaids' gowns for Grace Kelly's wedding to Prince Rainier of Monaco.         The stunning news coverage of the wedding added to Mrs. Kidder's celebrity. She dressed Rockefellers, Fords and Paleys and designed wedding dresses for Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter Luci Baines Johnson, as well as Richard M. Nixon's daughters, Tricia and Julie.         When labor organizers found out that Mrs. Kidder's dresses were made in a nonunion factory in Charlestown, Mass., they threatened to protest at Luci Johnson's wedding in 1966. Mrs. Kidder's response, her son Robert recalled yesterday, was to have a union label stitched into the wedding dress at another factory, owned by a Harvard classmate of her husband, which did have some union workers.         Mrs. Kidder's wedding gown for Tricia Nixon in 1971 also became controversial, though less bitterly so, because it was sleeveless, which many people considered unusually revealing for that decade.         Priscilla Comins was born in 1916 in Quincy, Mass. After graduating from the New England School of Design in Boston, she was a buyer in the bridal section of R. H. White's department store there. She opened The Bride's Shop with her husband, James Kidder, a businessman whom she married in 1940. Eventually, the shop began wholesaling dresses to stores around the country under the Priscilla of Boston label.         Besides helping make sleeveless gowns popular, she made other changes that became trends.         ''When Priscilla began designing dresses,'' Mille Martini Bratten, editor of Bride's Magazine said, ''she applied lace to them and made them decorative. Previously, dresses had been relatively simple and unadorned.''         Mrs. Kidder retired in 1993. Last year, her store was sold to the May Department Store Company.         Mr. Kidder died in 2001. Survivors include two sons, Robert, of Ipswich, Mass., and Richard, of Boston; a daughter, Betsy, of Ipswich; two sisters, Natalie Cahill of Reading, Mass., and Marjorie Townsend of Lexington, Mass.; and five grandchildren.       
         Mary Jane Russell, a leading fashion model of the 1940's and '50's who was a favorite of the photographers Louise Dahl-Wolfe and Irving Penn, died on Nov. 20 in Charleston, S.C. She was 77.         The cause was pulmonary fibrosis, said her husband, Edward T. Russell.         Mrs. Russell began modeling in New York in 1948, at the height of the New Look, and worked for the Ford Agency for next 13 years, appearing on dozens of covers of Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. Though not as tall as other photographic models -- she was just 5-foot-6 -- Mrs. Russell possessed a long neck and classical features that suited the era's elegant mood.         ''She brought to her posing as a model concentration and tenderness, rare in the fashion medium today,'' said Mr. Penn, who used Mrs. Russell for his photograph ''Girl Drinking,'' which appeared in Vogue in 1949. Often photographed in profile, she also posed for Mr. Penn's well-known 1951 image ''Girl With Tobacco on Tongue,'' a sitting that required Mrs. Russell to flick a bit of cigarette tobacco off her tongue repeatedly, in a ladylike way, of course.         Dahl-Wolfe often requested Mrs. Russell, according to Irving Solero, the photographer of the museum of the Fashion Institute of Technology, which houses Dahl-Wolfe's color archive. ''Louise had so much power and because she and Carmel Snow, the editor of Harper's Bazaar, were close, Louise was able to get whom she wanted, and she asked for Mary Jane a lot,'' said Mr. Solero, who estimates that Mrs. Russell modeled for about 30 percent of Dahl-Wolfe's photos. She also worked for the photographers Richard Avedon and William Klein.         She was born Mary Jane Walton on July 10, 1926, in Teaneck, N.J., and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. While she studied art, Mr. Russell, whom she had met at Teaneck High School, pursued her with a romantic diligence from the South Pacific, where he served in World War II as a radioman aboard seaplane tenders. He once addressed a letter to her ''The Most Beautiful Girl in the World, Bronxville, New York.'' Somehow, it reached her.         Mr. Russell, who later became president of Doyle Dane Bernbach, the advertising agency, proposed on his return from the war, suggesting Dec. 21 for their wedding because, as he said, it was the longest night of the year.         After Mrs. Russell retired from modeling, she became active in zoning and environmental issues in Pound Ridge, N.Y., where the couple lived for 37 years before moving to Bluffton, S.C.         In addion to her husband, she is survived by their three sons: John, of Stamford, Conn., David, of Hilton Head, S.C., and Mark, of Bedford, N.Y.
