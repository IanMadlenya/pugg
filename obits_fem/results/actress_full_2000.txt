         Hedy Lamarr, the raven-haired Viennese beauty who became one of the reigning temptresses in Hollywood films in the 1930's and 40's, especially as Delilah vamping Victor Mature's Samson, was found dead in her home in Orlando, Fla., yesterday. She was 86.         Miss Lamarr was forever identified with ''Ecstasy,'' a 1933 Czech film in which she appeared nude in a swimming scene and in a lovemaking sequence that was torrid for its time. The film was banned in many places in the United States for a number of years. But even though most Americans never saw it, ''Ecstasy'' excited their interest in the actress and shaped her career.         But as David Thomson, the film historian, said of her work in the United States: ''It became her lot to be cast as exotic, sultry women -- and she did her best; but conscientiousness is not quite what we expect in our femme fatales. Too often, she had a worried look.''         Miss Lamarr was born Hedwig Eva Marie Kiesler in Vienna, the daughter of a well-to-do banker and a concert pianist. She studied acting with Max Reinhardt in Vienna in 1931. He watched her read her lines one day and declared that she was either ''the most beautiful girl in the world'' or ''the most beautiful girl in Europe.'' (Press reports at the time carried both versions.)         She appeared in a few films before ''Ecstasy,'' a mostly silent film that was well received in Europe, where it was released as ''Symphonie der Liebe.'' Pope Pius XI  denounced it, but Mussolini issued a permit so that it could be shown at the Venice Film Festival. It won no awards there but attracted attentive audiences, most of them men.         By the time ''Ecstasy'' had begun to make the rounds in Europe, Miss Kiesler  was married to the first of her six husbands, Fritz Mandl, a Viennese munitions maker who was then in the process of making a tidy fortune by selling his wares to the Nazis. Mr. Mandl was upset by the film and spent a great sum of money tracking down and purchasing prints of ''Ecstasy'' so that nobody would see it. He explained that it was not so much because his wife could be seen nude, but because of the look on her face during the sex scenes.         Mr. Mandl came to regret all the money he spent buying the film. He didn't get all the prints. Then the Nazis seized his factory (he didn't pay his taxes, they claimed), and  Miss Kiesler left him (she thought he was dull) and made her way to London. There she got an acting job and was seen by Louis B. Mayer, who immediately offered her a contract to work for MGM, his Hollywood studio. Mr. Mayer changed her name to Lamarr after a silent film star named Barbara La Marr, whom he admired.         ''Ecstasy'' arrived in the United States in 1934 and was promptly banned in New York.  It was the subject of numerous court tests in the 1930's.         When the star of ''Ecstasy'' arrived in New York on the liner Normandie in 1937, she was mindful that ''Ecstasy'' had arrived before her and was determined to have audiences believe she was more than just a pretty face. She refused to display her knees for the photographers from the New York dailies who met the ship (her skirt reached her ankles), and she asked them not to refer to her as Hedy Kiesler anymore. ''Please call me Hedy Lamarr,'' she said.         In 1938 she made her first American film, ''Algiers,'' with Charles Boyer, with the result that undergraduates at Columbia voted her the girl with whom they would most like to be marooned on a desert island. She became popular; men fantasized about her, and women began to wear their hair as she did, parted down the middle.         But Miss Lamarr never achieved the stardom of some of her fellow emigrees -- Greta Garbo, Greer Garson or Marlene Dietrich -- all of whom won plaudits not just for their  sex appeal but also for their acting. The reviews of Miss Lamarr's films all emphasized her beauty, but when the scripts actually gave her something to say, the critics were not as passionate.         ''Now that she has inadvisedly been given an opportunity to act,'' wrote Bosley Crowther, reviewing ''Lady of the Tropics'' for The New York Times in 1939, ''it is necessary to report that she is essentially one of those museum pieces, like the Mona Lisa, who were more beautiful in repose.''         When she played a seductress enchanting  British plantation owners in Africa in ''White Cargo'' in 1942, Miss Lamarr purred, ''I am Tondelayo.'' This became grist for comedians; Jack Benny made  many jokes on the radio about an imaginary salesgirl named Tondelayo Schwartzkopf.         In another of her best-known roles, she gave Victor Mature the ultimate haircut in  ''Samson and Delilah,'' Cecil B. DeMille's 1949 epic. DeMille, who never overlooked the box-office potential of sexy women in the Bible and the actresses who played them, had a clinging gown made for her out of feathers from prize peacocks he kept.         Among Miss Lamarr's other films were  ''Comrade X'' (1940) with Clark Gable, for King Vidor; ''Boom Town'' (also 1940), in which she seduced Gable. She also appeared as a showgirl with Judy Garland and Lana Turner in ''Ziegfeld Girl'' (1941), and with Spencer Tracy and John Garfield in ''Tortilla Flat'' (1942). She was considered difficult to please and was said to have turned down memorable parts that went to Gene Tierney (''Laura'') and Ingrid Bergman (''Casablanca'' and ''Gaslight.'') After her appearance in ''Samson and Delilah'' she went on to display her perfect profile in such films as ''Copper Canyon'' (1950), ''A Lady Without Passport'' (1950), the comedy ''My Favorite Spy'' (1951) and ''The Story of Mankind'' (1957) as her career faded .         Her private life was messy and sad.         In early 1939, she met Gene Markey, a writer and producer in Hollywood, and they  eloped to Mexico. She divorced Mr. Markey the following year, complaining to a judge that they had been married for 14 months and that in all that time, he had spent only four evenings alone with her. The judge granted the divorce, but suggested that if she ever contemplated a future marriage, she should spend more than a month getting to know her man.         After her divorce from Mr. Markey, Miss Lamarr went to a Hollywood dinner party at the home of Janet Gaynor and there met George Antheil, the composer. Miss Lamarr and Antheil got to talking about the war and how tough it was going to be to stop the Nazis.         As the story goes, Miss Lamarr recalled hearing some conversations that had occurred between her first husband, Mr. Mandl, and the Nazis, who seemed to place great value on creating some sort of device that would permit the radio control of airborne torpedoes and reduce the danger of jamming. She and Antheil got to discussing all this. The idea, they decided, was to defeat jamming efforts by sending synchronized radio signals on various wavelengths to missiles, which could then be directed to hit their mark.         Antheil supplied the technical expertise for the concept and on Aug. 11, 1942, the two received a United States patent for the use of radio-controlled missiles that could be used against the Germans. There were some doubts that Miss Lamarr had the technical background to give much to the project, but Antheil always credited her. The government was not initially interested in their device, but a refined version of it was used by the American military in the 1960's -- after the patent had expired. They never made a dime. In 1996 they were honored for their work by a professional engineering society. ''It's about time,'' was Miss Lamarr's only comment.         In 1941 Miss Lamarr was briefly engaged to the actor George Montgomery. She continued to make movies and worked hard to sell millions of dollars in war bonds. She told an audience in Philadelphia that she was just ''a gold digger for Uncle Sam.'' In the spring of 1943 she married the British actor John Loder. She knew him six months before she married him. They were divorced three years later.         Miss Lamarr's other marriages -- to Teddy Stauffer, a former band leader who ran a nightclub in Acapulco, Mexico; Howard Lee, a Texas oilman; and Lewis W. Boles, a West Coast lawyer -- all ended in divorce.         She adopted a son, James, and had two children with Loder, a son, Anthony, and a daughter, Denise; they all survive her.         Early in her career, a certain litigiousness manifested itself and continued to dog her existence. In 1943 she sued Loew's and MGM because they failed to pay her a contractual $2,000 a week. They said they were unable to pay her what they owed because President Franklin Delano Roosevelt had issued a wartime executive order limiting all salaries to $25,000 a year. The case was settled out of court.         Over the years, she was involved in several other lawsuits that did not work out so well. Among them was one against a Los Angeles department store that had accused her of shoplifting. (She was acquitted of the charge, and her own lawsuit against the store was dismissed.)         Best known of her lawsuits was one directed in the 1960's and 70's against the publisher and ghostwriter of ''Ecstasy and Me: My Life as a Woman,'' an autobiography that was intended to revive her notoriety as a sex goddess. She said the book was ''deliberately written as an obscene, shocking, scandalous, naughty, wanton, fleshy, sensual, lecherous, lustful and scarlet version'' of her life. Her suit failed.         In 1991, living sparingly in South Florida, she was again accused of shoplifting ($21 worth of personal-care items from a drug store) but not prosecuted. In recent years, Miss Lamarr lived quietly in a suburb of Orlando. Friends said she was legally blind and did not venture out on her own.         ''What happened to me?,'' Miss Lamarr  asked the syndicated columnist Sheilah  Graham in 1966. ''I made $7 million and yet I was on relief and they gave me all of $48 a week.''         ''I'm not so crazy about acting,'' she told Miss Graham. ''All that makeup and getting up so early. Maybe I'll go to Europe. Oh, they want me. I have many offers.''       
         Anne Hebert, a poet and novelist who brought the violent passions of her native rural Quebec to wider audiences in France and the United States, died on Jan. 23 at a hospital in Montreal. She was 83 and lived in Quebec City.         Part of a post-World War II generation of Quebecois intellectuals who breathed new life into fading language and cultural links with France, Ms. Hebert spent most of the last half century in Paris, explaining once: ''Montreal is too American, Quebec City is too small, and Paris is very, very beautiful.''         Despite the distractions of Paris, Ms. Hebert set seven of her eight novels in the rural Quebec she had known as a child. Reflecting on her trans-Atlantic vision, she once told an interviewer: ''You need distance. It helps you to better reflect on the issues and places you are writing about.''         Born in 1916 in a village outside of Quebec City, she spent her teenage years battling a series of life-threatening illnesses -- appendicitis, pleurisy and scarlet fever. Often isolated in quarantine, she voraciously read books and poetry, with many of the volumes supplied by a favorite cousin, a poet. In 1939 she published her first poems. In 1999 she published her last work, ''Un Habit de Lumiere,'' a novel.         Writing ''poetry is not the relaxation of the seventh day,'' she once said. ''It is thirst and hunger, bread and wine.'' Reflecting this serious, lifelong commitment to the writer's craft, she won Canada's most prestigious literary award, the Governor General's Award, at regular intervals: in 1960, in 1975 and in 1992.         The tortured isolation of her adolescence resurfaced in poems and novels that revolved around violent themes, rape and murder, in rural Quebec.         ''She stripped bare the lives of bourgeois families who hid their little hells,'' said Denise Boucher, a poet who is president of the Union of Quebec Writers. ''It was writing that rebelled against conformism.''         In 1970 Ms. Hebert won wide acclaim for her novel ''Kamouraska,'' a tale of adultery and murder set in a small northern Quebec village of her ancestors. In 1973 Claude Jutra turned the novel into a critically acclaimed movie, casting the French-Canadian actress Genevieve Bujold in the lead. Yves Simoneau based a movie on another of her novels, ''Les Fous de Bassan,'' translated into English as ''In the Shadow of the Wind.''         In 1982 France awarded the Prix Femina to this book, a dark tale about the disappearance of two teenage girls from an isolated English-speaking community in Quebec's Gaspe peninsula in the 1930's.         ''She used words like jewels, like gemstones that were sharp, clear and fine,'' said Sheila Fischman, who translated Ms. Hebert's last seven novels into English. The most recent translation was published last year under the title ''Am I Disturbing You?''         Ms. Hebert, who never married, often said she would have liked to have had children but could not reconcile the demands of writing with the demands of motherhood.       
         Sarah Caudwell, the British author whose modest but ecstatically received output of three erudite and maliciously witty mystery novels led at least one critic to compare her to Oscar Wilde, died on Jan. 28 at her home in London. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, said Barney Karpfinger, her agent.         Ms. Caudwell produced her first novel, ''Thus Was Adonis Murdered,'' in 1981, during an accomplished career as a Chancery barrister. The novel was set in Lincoln's Inn Fields, where the author had practiced law. It featured a sleuth, Hilary Tamar, who taught law at Oxford, as did Ms. Caudwell.         Although the story revolved around the lusty antics of ''a decorative little group'' of junior barristers, it was the classical erudition and acerbic tongue of the narrator, whose sex is never stated, that set the droll tone of the series. ''I am an  historian'' was Tamar's explanation for the devious workings of his or her mind. ''My profession largely consists of speaking ill of the dead.''         ''The Shortest Way to Hades''  (1985) and ''The Sirens Sang of Murder'' (1989) continued in the same elegantly mannered style, with stories bound up in arcane areas of British law and steeped in obscure allusions to classical literature. (A crucial clue in ''The Shortest Way to Hades'' is embedded in Book XI of ''The Odyssey.'') Her final novel, ''The Sybil in Her Grave,'' which deals with insider stock trading and corporate takeovers, will be published in June by Delacorte Press.         The incisiveness of her legal points won her admirers among members of the profession, including Robert Bork (who was once quoted as saying, ''In my opinion, there can't be too many Sarah Caudwell novels''), while the gleeful savagery of her satiric style made her a darling of the critics. Newgate Callendar, in The New York Times Book Review, praised her for writing ''in a kind of English that has not been around since the days of Oscar Wilde.''         Sarah Caudwell was born May 27, 1939, to the author and journalist Claud Cockburn and his wife, Jean Ross, the actress and writer who was Christopher Isherwood's model for Sally Bowles in his Berlin stories and the musical ''Cabaret.'' Ms. Caudwell chose the surname Caudwell because it was a family name. She is survived by her half-brothers, the political writers Alexander, Andrew and Patrick Cockburn.         Her family ''recognized how much of Sarah there was in her characters,'' Andrew Cockburn said. ''There are certain aspects of Hilary Tamar, certain eccentricities, that are pure Sarah, although not Sarah's pipe-smoking. And, of course, that acuity of mind. Sarah had this incredibly sharp brain, which was evidenced by her success at both navigating and portraying what someone in Oliver Cromwell's Parliament once called 'the tortuous, ungodly jungle of English law.' ''         She graduated from Aberdeen University and received her law degree at St. Ann's College, Oxford. When she arrived there, the Oxford Union, a prestigious debating society, was still closed to women, said Andrew Cockburn. She led the fight that changed that, and she made her point at one off-limits event that she attended dressed as a man. Her disguise was discovered and she was ejected, but ultimately won the war.         She joined the Chancery bar in 1966 and worked in property and tax law. When she joined Lloyds Bank, she became a senior executive in the trust department.         ''As a woman, she had to have had a first-class mind to join the Chancery bar, to have built up a successful practice and to have become a senior executive at Lloyds,'' said a friend and fellow barrister, John Tackebury. ''All these institutions were highly resistant to women at a senior level, and certainly to a woman who smoked a pipe.''       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Veronica Cooper Converse, the widow of the actor Gary Cooper, died on Feb. 16 at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         Ms. Converse married Mr. Cooper in 1933. After his death in 1961 she married Dr. John Converse, a plastic surgeon, who died in 1981.         Known as Rocky, Ms. Cooper was the daughter of a governor of the New York Stock Exchange. She occasionally worked as an actress.         She was an active fund-raiser for the Institute of Reconstructive Plastic Surgery at New York University Medical Center.         In her youth Ms. Converse was a noted athlete; she was the California State Woman's Skeet Champion, as well as a golfer, swimmer, scuba diver, surfer and tennis player.         She was born in Brooklyn, and is survived by her daughter, Maria Cooper Janis.       
         Sasha Von Scherler, an actress and comedian who appeared in more than 100 productions in New York City, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 65 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung disease, said her daughter, Ruth Mayer.         Miss Von Scherler followed her mother, an actress trained by the playwright and producer David Belasco, into a life in the theater. Her father, a Prussian baron named Walram-Voystingus Albert Alexander Von Schoeler, did not approve.         In a 1980 interview in The New York Times, Miss Von Scherler said her early life was marked by some radical peregrinations, from a convent school in Windsor, Ontario, to Tokyo, where she first set foot on stage in an amateur production.         After attending the Yale School of Drama -- she was expelled for staging a personal sit-in to show her opposition to building stage scenery -- Miss Von Scherler made her professional debut at the Cherry Lane Theater in 1956, in George Bernard Shaw's ''Admirable Bashville.'' It was the first in a nearly unbroken string of plays over the next 20 years.         Among her roles were Mrs. Brown in Eugene O'Neill's ''Great God Brown'' in 1959, Olivia in Joseph Papp's 1969 production of ''Twelfth Night'' in Central Park, and Avonia Bunn in three separate productions of ''Trelawney of the Wells.'' She helped support her acting habit by appearing in several soap operas.         More often than not Miss Von Scherler, a woman with large, twinkling eyes and a merry laugh, played supporting roles, often stealing scenes. In a 1971 review of ''Trelawney,'' Walter Kerr of The Times wrote that ''Miss Von Scherler was rather like a fine painting propped in one corner; the rest of the room might be filled with attractive objects and engaging people, but your eye kept wandering back to her.''         In the mid-1980's Miss Von Scherler earned a master's degree in social work and became a therapist and counselor; she worked for more than 10 years at an AIDS treatment center in Greenwich Village.         In 1995 she appeared in ''Party Girl,'' a film written and directed by her daughter, Daisy Von Scherler Mayer.         In addition to Daisy and Ruth Mayer, both of Brooklyn, she is survived by her husband, Paul Avila Mayer, and another daughter, Rachael, of Glen Ridge, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Lila Kedrova, the Russian-born actress whose portrayals of an aging French prostitute in screen and stage versions of ''Zorba the Greek'' won her an Academy Award and a Tony, died on Feb. 16 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. She was believed to be around 82.         Her death was announced in The Sault Star on Feb. 17 but was not reported by news agencies.         Although she appeared in scores of films and plays in England, Canada and on the Continent that won her accolades ranging from a French Cesar for the film ''Razzia sur la Chnouf'' (1955), the Evening Standard Award in London for her stage role in ''The Cherry Orchard'' in 1969, a Genie Award (Canada's equivalent of the Oscar) for ''Eliza's Horoscope'' (1970) and a Golden Mask at Taormina in Sicily for the film ''Tell Me a Riddle'' (1980), Ms. Kedrova was best known her for portrayal of Madame Hortense in ''Zorba.''         In the film and Broadway musical adaptations of the 1946 Nikos Kazantzakis novel ''Zorba, the Greek,'' which starred Anthony Quinn, Miss Kedrova won raves as the earthy Zorba's aging, dying mistress.         ''The old woman of Lila Kedrova is brilliantly realized, a wrinkled and tacky relic of a once successful coquette, still hopeful, audacious and courageous,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in his review of the 1964 film in The New York Times.         When she recreated her role on Broadway in 1983, Frank Rich of The Times described Ms. Kedrova's Madame Hortense as ''a small, round, smeary-faced woman out of a Toulouse-Lautrec canvas'' who could bat ''her big, Betty Boop eyes with a schoolgirl's blushing flirtatiousness.''         He said: ''Miss Kedrova may indeed be of a certain age, but we see the young 'cabaret star' she claims to have once been; we also see that the old Hortense is remembering the young Hortense just as we do. No wonder Miss Kedrova shimmers, and no wonder our eyes mist over.''         The role that won Miss Kedrova her Oscar as best supporting actress and her Tony for best featured actress in a musical was first offered by the film's Greek director, Michael Cacoyannis, to Simone Signoret.         But, Miss Kedrova said, after two days on location in Crete, Miss Signoret withdrew, and Mr. Cacoyannis telephoned Ms. Kedrova in Paris to invite her to join his cast.         ''I accepted, but in fact my feelings were ambivalent,'' she told The Times of London some years ago. ''It was a fascinating role, but not perhaps for me. What had I in common with this vulgarian, this whore, 20 years older than myself? Then I thought I must try to understand her heart, enter completely into her mentality and find what is most real and sincere in myself. I found I could do this, but I was quite amazed, quite unprepared to win the Academy Award.''         There was one other problem, Miss Kedrova told Nora Ephron in a profile in The New York Post in 1965. When Mr. Cacoyannis called, he asked if Miss Kedrova spoke English.         ''He asked me the question in French,'' she said. ''And I replied, 'Oui.' It was the biggest lie in my life.''         But remembering the lyrics to a few American songs she had sung and expressions like ''How do you do?'' and ''Thank you,'' she got the part.         Miss Kedrova, who was born in Leningrad into the Kedroffs, a distinguished and well-to-do musical family, fled the aftermath of the Russian Revolution with them and became an emigree in Paris.         A restless child, she was a frequent truant and runaway. ''Once I joined the Gypsies; another time I took a job in a circus pulling a bear on a chain,'' she told The Times of London. ''When I was 12, I fell in love with the theater and knew then what I wanted to do. And though my parents had planned a musical career for me, they allowed me to join a troupe of Russian actors, resident in Paris, who played according to the Stanislavsky method. I was with them for three years.         ''In those days I acted with complete spontaneity, lived my parts almost instinctively, and it was some time before I realized that any talent, however bright, needs guarding and guiding.''         So she studied drama with the actor-director Pierre Valde, who became her first husband.         In the early 1950's she began to achieve critical and popular success onstage in France, where she starred in productions like ''The Rose Tattoo,'' ''A View From the Bridge,'' ''A Taste of Honey'' and ''The Brothers Karamazov.''         Her second husband, Richard Howard, a director whom she married in 1969, said that Miss Kedrova, who had no other immediate survivors, made her last stage appearance in the early 1990's at the Chichester Festival and her last film in 1993. The couple maintained homes in Toronto and Paris as well as Sault Ste. Marie.         Some reference books listed Miss Kedrova's year of birth as 1918, and Mr. Howard pointed out that other, later dates were to be found elsewhere. He said that when her family fled Russia, they left their papers behind. And the false papers they were given in France were confiscated by the Nazis.         ''She liked it that way,'' Mr. Howard said of her agelessness. ''I remember her telling me that it was wonderful because she could choose to be any age she wanted to be, and that she wanted to be 16.''       
         Helen Martin, a character actress whose career embraced the Broadway stage as well as films and television, died on March 25 at her home in Monterey, Calif. She was 90.         A founding member of the American Negro Theater in Harlem, Ms. Martin was among the first African-American actresses to take the Broadway stage, making her debut as the sister of Canada Lee in Orson Welles's 1941 production of ''Native Son.''         She went on to appear in Elia Kazan's staging of ''Deep Are the Roots''; ''The Long Dream,'' directed by Lloyd Richards; ''The Amen Corner,'' written by James Baldwin;  and alongside her American Negro Theater colleagues Ruby Dee and Ossie Davis in Mr. Davis's play ''Purlie Victorious.''         She also appeared off Broadway as an African queen in ''The Blacks,'' Jean Genet's historical drama.         As a teenager in Nashville, Ms. Martin performed with local theater groups and led a 12-musician band. She attended Fisk University for two years before moving to Chicago and later New York, where she apprenticed with the W.P.A. Theater and the Rose McClendon Players.         Beginning in the early 1970's Ms. Martin portrayed a variety of offbeat characters in television series about black families, beginning with ''That's My Mama,'' starring Clifton Davis, and including ''Benson,'' ''Good Times'' and ''Full House.'' She is perhaps best remembered as Pearl Shay, the loud next-door neighbor in the show ''227.''         She also appeared in several television specials, including ''Roots,'' in which she portrayed the village elder, a role she called her favorite.         Ms. Martin's film credits include ''Cotton Comes to Harlem,'' ''Repo Man,'' ''A Rage in Harlem,'' ''Doc Hollywood,'' ''House Party 2,'' ''Beverly Hills Cop III,'' ''Kiss the Girls'' and the Warren Beatty film ''Bulworth,'' in which she played the character known as Momma Doll.         Ms. Martin was nominated for a N.A.A.C.P. Image Award for her role as the hero's grandmother in the 1987 film ''Hollywood Shuffle'' and in 1992 was inducted into the Black Filmmakers Hall of Fame in Oakland, Calif.         She had recently completed the filming of ''Something to Sing About,'' to be released this spring.       
         Claire Trevor, an Academy Award-winning actress who epitomized cynical but warm-hearted careerists -- reporters, gun molls, saloon entertainers and trollops -- died Saturday at a hospital near her home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 91 and had suffered from respiratory ailments in recent months, said Richard Elbaum, a spokesman for the family.         A Brooklyn native who became enamored of stage acting and found her way into the movies during Hollywood's golden age, Miss Trevor appeared in nearly 70 films, working under legendary directors like John Huston and John Ford and playing alongside such famous leading men as John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart.         She played the former girlfriend of a gangster (Humphrey Bogart) who becomes a burned-out streetwalker in ''Dead End'' (1937) and a freewheeling woman forced out of town by bluenoses in the classic version of ''Stagecoach'' (1939). She was the alcoholic mistress of a mobster played by Edward G. Robinson in ''Key Largo'' (1948) and a spunky jet passenger in ''The High and the Mighty'' (1954).         She may be best remembered for ''Key Largo,'' for which she won the Oscar for best supporting actress playing the part of Gaye Dawn, a has-been cabaret singer who, in one emotionally charged scene, is forced by her sadistic lover to sing ''Moanin' Low'' in return for a drink. Feebly, she manages to sob through the song, but Mr. Robinson's character denies her because, he says, her singing was ''rotten.''         Miss Trevor also received Academy Award nominations for ''The High and the Mighty'' and ''Dead End.''         The blond, smoky-voiced Miss Trevor was a dedicated performer who repeatedly breathed fresh life into her films, many of which sorely needed her grace and gumption. Early on she became a ''queen of the B's,'' the low-budget action movies that rounded off double bills. But she got plenty of ''A'' roles, making the most of them.         In other key roles, she was a faithless lover in ''The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse'' (1938), a conspiratorial killer in ''Murder, My Sweet'' (1945), a vitriolic Broadway actress in ''The Velvet Touch'' (1948), an overprotective mother in ''Marjorie Morningstar'' (1958) and a scornful shrew in two melodramas, ''Two Weeks in Another Town'' (1962) and ''How to Murder Your Wife'' (1965).         The modest Miss Trevor was one of the few actresses whose seemingly effortless talent made most viewers take her for granted, while film buffs cherished her. Looking back, she concluded that she never became a top star because she lacked the drive that energizes them. ''I didn't know,'' she said, ''that to make a real career in Hollywood you have to become a 'personality,' have to cultivate publicity departments and become known as 'The Ear' or even 'The Toe.' ''         On television, she won an Emmy award in an acclaimed 1956 revival of ''Dodsworth,'' with Fredric March in the title role. She artfully portrayed his vain wife, who consorts with shallow lovers in a futile battle against age. Miss Trevor said she enjoyed working for television because it provided her with a wider, more sympathetic range of roles. But she said she never wanted to sacrifice personal happiness for her career. ''As for a TV series, never,'' she said, ''Life's too short and, frankly, I'm not terribly ambitious.''         Claire Trevor was born Claire Wemlinger on March 8, 1909, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the only child of Noel and Betty Wemlinger. (Mr. Elbaum said Miss Trevor's stepson, Donald Bren, said she was born in 1910; many reference works list her birth in 1909.) Her father was a Fifth Avenue merchant tailor who soon moved the family to Larchmont in Westchester County. After her graduation from high school, Miss Trevor took art courses for six months at Columbia University before studying for six more months at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She began honing her craft in repertory theater in Michigan, St. Louis and Long Island and through shorts filmed in Brooklyn.         These appearances led to starring roles in two Broadway plays, ''Whistling in the Dark,'' a hit, and ''The Party's Over,'' a flop. The Fox movie company had noticed her, however, and offered a five-year contract. Although she wanted to stay in the theater, she had no immediate stage prospects and accepted Fox's offer, arriving in Hollywood in 1933.         She then made 14 Fox quickies over four years. Most were action-adventure pictures dominated by the leading men, but she won wide praise for playing several hard-bitten newspaper reporters. ''I worked like a demon, and I knew it was a job,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1995. ''Saturday night, you never could plan on going out to dinner because we'd break for dinner for one hour and work till 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the morning.''         Spencer Tracy was the early co-star she admired most, and she said she quickly began imitating ''the clever way he throws away a line.'' Another favorite leading man was Mr. Robinson, with whom she appeared in ''Big Town,'' a popular radio series, from 1937 to 1940. He played Steve Wilson, editor of the mythical Illustrated Press, and she was Lorelei Kilbourne, his ace reporter and foil.         Her longtime wish to return to Broadway materialized in 1947, when she and Philip Dorn co-starred in a comedy, ''The Big Two.'' The consensus of critics was that they gave the play much more artistry and vitality than it deserved. It closed after 21 performances.         Her private life was far different from the lives of the sassy characters she played. She was married to Clark Andrews, director of her radio show, from 1938 to 1942, when they divorced. In 1943 she married Cylos Dunsmoore, a Navy lieutenant. The marriage produced a son, Charles, but ended in divorce in 1947.         Her third marriage, to Milton Bren, a film producer, lasted from 1948 until his death in 1979 of a brain tumor. Mr. Bren had two sons from a previous marriage, later prompting Miss Trevor to recall fondly that they had ''an instant family.'' In 1978 Miss Trevor lost her son, Charles, in an airliner disaster.         The losses of her son and husband in the span of a year left her devastated, and she moved to New York, settling into a Fifth Avenue apartment and embarking on a busy social schedule. She also occasionally returned to acting, in her last role playing an aging schoolteacher in the 1987 television movie ''Norman Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties.''         Miss Trevor would later return to California, where she was also known as a generous philanthropist.         She is survived by her stepsons, Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Company, a real estate investment firm in Newport Beach, and Peter Bren, president of Koll-Bren-Schreiber, a real estate investment firm in New York.       
         Paula Wessely, a legendary Austrian stage and screen actress whose postwar career flourished despite her having starred in several Nazi propaganda movies, died on Thursday at a hospital in Vienna. She was 93.         Ms. Wessely, whose distinctive voice was immediately recognizable to several generations of German speakers, seemed equally at home in classical and modern drama, as convincing in Schiller's ''Mary Stuart'' as she was in Tennessee Williams's ''Glass Menagerie.''         Her electric presence prompted the novelist Thomas Mann to write, ''She holds a place in the small gallery of women who, unwittingly, have moved my heart.''         Born in Vienna on Jan. 20, 1907, she was still a teenager when she first appeared on stage at the Vienna Volkstheater in 1924. On her 80th birthday she demonstrated that she could still draw a packed house when she did a public reading at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin.         Before and during World War II  she played leading roles in numerous German-language movies sponsored by Joseph Goebbels's Nazi propaganda machine, most notoriously a popular 1941 film called ''Heimkehr'' (''Homecoming''). She often portrayed strong-willed German women capable of overcoming all adversity.         After the war she expressed regret for her collaboration with the Nazis  and, while some critics considered her repentance less than sincere,  Austrians embraced her anew, allowing her to enjoy a still more glittering postwar career as the grande dame of the Vienna Burgtheater.         Although she also appeared in many postwar movies, she refused invitations to work in Hollywood and her reputation never reached far beyond the German-speaking world.       
         Nancy Marchand, the distinguished character actress who excelled at playing wise and imperious authority figures -- newspaper publishers, queens, grande dames and a madam -- and who achieved perhaps her greatest fame as the domineering mother of a mob boss in the television series ''The Sopranos,''  died on Sunday at her home in Stratford, Conn., one day short of her 72nd birthday. She also had a home in Manhattan.         Her daughter Katie Sparer Bowe said that no specific cause of death was given, but for several years the actress had been suffering from cancer and chronic pulmonary disease.         A wide diversity of playwrights -- among them Chekhov, Shaw and  Shakespeare as well as Jean Genet, Paul Osborn and A. R. Gurney -- was within Ms. Marchand's range. She once described her physical presence as ''a strange combination of being very imposing and down-to-earth,'' an accurate assessment of the seemingly contradictory image she projected.         That description could be applied to the overburdened wife she played in the 1980 Broadway revival of Osborn's ''Morning's at Seven,'' the patrician publisher on the long-running ''Lou Grant'' television series and her portrayal of Livia Soprano, the monster mother of them all, a woman bred into the Mafia who without a blink of hesitation sets up her son Tony to be assassinated because he has moved her to a nursing home.         Except for her indomitability, Livia was in direct contrast to all the ''tasteful ladies'' Ms. Marchand  played in her busy career. At 70, after more than 50 years of acting, she discovered a new popularity, and it was for playing a wildly unsympathetic character. Livia Soprano was a role that she compared to that of Caligula's great-grandmother in ''I, Claudius,'' a woman who also happened to be named Livia.         Throughout her career, Ms. Marchand gave her roles an unexpected edge. Even when her characters were at their most officious, they retained a measure of charm, and her more affectionate characters could also be sardonic. She was an expert at both light and more serious comedy, moving effortlessly from the outrageous antics in the movie spoof ''The Naked Gun,'' to Lady Bracknell in ''The Importance of Being Earnest.''         In plays like ''Morning's at Seven,'' she warmed an audience's collective heart, but she never wore her own heart on her sleeve, avoiding the cul de sac of sentimentality. Instead she was wily in performance, turning in an instant from comedy to poignance.         Often she acted onstage with her husband, Paul Sparer -- in everything from ''A Phoenix Too Frequent'' by Christopher Fry to Edward Albee's ''Delicate Balance'' to Mr. Gurney's ''Love Letters.'' Mr. Sparer also had his own rewarding career in plays that included Elie Wiesel's ''Zalmen, or the Madness of God'' and ''The Burnt Flowerbed'' by Ugo Betti. Individually and together they were ultimate theatrical professionals.         Mr. Sparer died in November. In addition to her daughter Katie, an actress who lives in Stratford, Ms. Marchand is survived by a son, David of Madison, Wis.; another daughter, Rachel Sparer Bersier, an opera singer of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.         Offstage, Ms. Marchand was the reverse of so many of her strong-willed characters, a woman with a natural sense of insecurity, someone who felt uneasy in social situations. ''I'm always very uncomfortable with people.'' she once explained in an interview in The New York Times. ''It's something that I get upset with myself for, but that's the way I am. But I love people. And  when I'm on the stage, I can embrace people and still feel safe. There are a lot of different facets to my personality that I don't use all the time in my house, or in everyday life, that I can experience and share when I'm on a stage.''         Her roles, she said, were more a question of chance than choice. But whatever she was called on to do, even if it meant being as malevolent as Livia Soprano, she did it with enthusiasm. As always, she was captivated by her profession. Looking back on her career, she said, ''Acting was something I had to do.''         Nancy Marchand was born in Buffalo on June 19, 1928. After studying theater at Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, she made her first professional appearance onstage in 1946 in ''The Late George Apley'' in Ogunquit, Me. It was while acting in Shakespeare and Shaw at the Brattle Theater in Cambridge, Mass., that she met -- and then married -- Mr. Sparer. When they moved to New York, she appeared on live television, playing Jo in a dramatization of ''Little Women,'' and then playing the female lead opposite Rod Steiger in the original television version of Paddy Chayefsky's ''Marty.''         In 1957 she made her Broadway debut in ''Miss Isobel,'' and two years later won an Obie award for her role as Madame Irma in the Off Broadway premiere of ''The Balcony'' by Genet. For several years she played leading Shakespearean roles with the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn. As an original member of the A.P.A. theater company (formally the Association of Producing Artists), she was Lady Sneerwell in ''The School for Scandal,'' Arkadina in ''The Seagull,'' Dona Ana in ''Man and Superman'' and other classic characters.         Continuing her devotion to repertory theater, she joined the theater at Lincoln Center to act in plays by Schiller (Queen Elizabeth in ''Mary Stuart''), Gorky and Sean O'Casey (''The Plough and the Stars'' with Jack MacGowran).         Ms. Marchand worked with equal ease on Broadway, off Broadway and in regional theater, as well as in movies and on television. In the 1980's she played the title role in Christopher Durang's ''Sister Mary Ignatius Explains It All for You,'' Bessie Berger in Clifford Odets's ''Awake and Sing'' at Circle in the Square, Klytemnestra in Ezra Pound's ''Elektra'' and the august mother in ''The Cocktail Hour'' by Mr. Gurney.         In the following decade, she moved on to Jon Robin Baitz's ''End of the Day'' at Playwrights Horizons, and, in 1993, acted in a double header of Peter Shaffer plays, ''Black Comedy'' and ''White Liars,'' at the Roundabout Theater Company. That same year she also played the wicked stepmother in a revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella'' at the New York City Opera.         Her movie appearances included ''The Hospital''; two films with the team of Merchant Ivory, ''The Bostonians'' and ''Jefferson in Paris'';  and the remake of ''Sabrina,'' in which she played Harrison Ford's mother. When she played Mrs. Pynchon, the publisher of The Los Angeles Tribune on ''Lou Grant,'' the role became a keystone of her career; for it she won four Emmy awards. Some years later on television's ''Spearfield's Daughter,'' she switched cities and became the publisher of The New York Courier.         When Ms. Marchand played Livia Soprano on ''The Sopranos,'' television viewers wondered how her son Tony, played by James Gandolfini, and his wife (Edie Falco) could put up with her malice and her prejudices. The answer, of course, was that there was nothing much they could do against this self-dramatizing force of nature.         At the end of the show's first season, Tony was about to smother his mother with a pillow, but a stroke got there first and she was left gasping for breath in a hospital bed. David Chase, the creator of the Home Box Office series, said yesterday that he always planned to bring Livia back for a second year. He added that he was impressed by Ms. Marchand's  courage as she continued to perform despite her illness.         When that season ended, Ms. Marchand said she was looking forward to the second round: ''Who knows what lurks in the mind of Livia?'' Viewers soon found out: more of the same.         During the last show of the second season, there was a sudden twist in the narrative. Tony gave his mother airline tickets so that she and his aunt could fly to Arizona. Before she could get on the plane, Livia was stopped by men from airport security. The tickets were stolen property. Frantically, she telephoned her son.         Because filming on the third season of ''Sopranos'' was not scheduled to begin until Aug. 1, that scene represents Ms. Marchand's final performance: about to be arrested and furious at Tony for putting her in that predicament. Mr. Chase would not discuss forthcoming events in the series, but if the actress had lived, undoubtedly the mother and son battle would have continued and Livia Soprano would have had the last word.         Correction:  June 21, 2000, Wednesday  An obituary of the actress Nancy Marchand yesterday misidentified Livia, a Roman historical figure, in some copies. Livia, to whom Ms. Marchand compared her television role as Livia in ''The Sopranos,'' was the great-grandmother of the Emperor Caligula, not his mother.         A page one reference to the obituary misstated the character's name as Lydia in some copies.         Correction:  June 22, 2000, Thursday  An obituary of the actress Nancy Marchand on Tuesday misstated the title of a Peter Shaffer play in which she appeared with the Roundabout Theater Company in 1993. It is ''White Lies,'' not ''White Liars.''       
         Thea Porter, one of the earliest  among British fashion designers who rode hippie chic to high visibility, if not always to enduring commercial success, died on Monday in London. She was 72.         Well before globalization became a fashion cliche, Ms. Porter was deploying the concept in her own canny rendition of it. Beginning in 1967, from a series of shops located in unlikely quarters of London and Paris, and later at I. Magnin in San Francisco and Giorgio of Beverly Hills, she made and sold clothes whose inspiration was drawn from her far-ranging travels and a childhood spent as the half-French, half-English daughter of a missionary posted to the Middle East.         Ms. Porter dressed Elizabeth Taylor for the souk, put the socialite Dalitha Getty in caftans and created Symbolist-inspired costumes for a perpetual party centered on the Rolling Stones and their newly made friends from the British aristocracy.         Her specialty was in finding exceptional fabrics -- Swiss chiffons, Indian handprints, 1930's French voiles uncovered in warehouses -- and deploying them voluminously for a clientele undaunted by the extravagance of both her silhouettes and her fees. A gypsy costume Ms. Porter made for Begum Aga Khan to wear to a fancy dress ball given by Baron Alexis de Rede was lavish enough that her fellow Briton, the designer Hardy Amies, described it as ''pre-guillotine.''         Born in Jerusalem on Dec. 24, 1927, Dorothea Noelle Naomi Porter was raised in Damascus, Syria, and briefly attended the Royal Holloway College in London, until she was expelled because, she once explained, ''I wanted to study art.'' Although her art studies were equally short-lived, a job as a librarian in Beirut eventually resulted in her marriage, in 1953, to Robert Porter, an economist attached to the British Embassy in Lebanon. As a diplomat's wife in the early 60's, Ms. Porter traveled to Iran and Jordan, spent holidays in Italy and France and, as she once said, ''went to nightclubs every night and had millions of clothes.''         The marriage dissolved in 1964, and Ms. Porter began a fashion career with textiles collected during her travels. By good fortune, the prevailing style of the moment was High Ethnic. Clients at her Moroccan-inspired shop on Greek Street in London included not only rock stars but also members of a nascent jet set whose style reflected their newfound nomadism. She attired both Jayne Wrightsman, the wife of the oil industrialist Charles Wrightsman, and the actress Jane Fonda as if for a visit to a caravanserai in Kabul.         ''Her real contribution was introducing ethnic clothes for that late 60's, rich hippie period,'' said the fashion designer Zandra Rhodes. It was a period, Ms. Rhodes said, ''of shawls and prints and unusual textiles that you might have seen on the Beatles or the Mamas and Papas,'' or the titled people who indulged their escapist fantasies with what one critic referred to as Ms. Porter's ''peacockerie.''         In 1971 Michael Butler, the producer of ''Hair'' on Broadway, financed a shop for Ms. Porter in New York. When the enterprise failed, Ms. Porter returned to England and turned her hand to decoration. Her store, Thea Porter Decorations, eventually went into receivership; she later formed a brief partnership in a smaller store with Princess Dina of Jordan. ''Sadly, one didn't hear of her after that,'' said Ms. Rhodes.         After a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease in 1994, Ms. Porter moved from her Mayfair apartment to a nursing home in Kensington, where she died.         She is survived by a daughter, Venetia.       
         Rose Marie Thomas, the head of the fund-raising organization for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, which was founded by her husband, the comedian Danny Thomas, died on Wednesday. She was 86 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         Mrs. Thomas had held the fund-raising position since the death in 1991 of her husband, who established the hospital four decades ago.         During his lifetime, she also helped raise money for the hospital, a research and treatment center for catastrophic childhood diseases.         Born Rose Marie Cassaniti in Detroit, she was a singer who had a radio show. She met Mr. Thomas in Detroit, and they were married in 1936.         She is survived by two daughters, the actress Marlo Thomas, and Terre Thomas; a son, Tony; five grandchildren and three sisters.       
         Loretta Young, the Academy Award-winning actress whose high cheekbones, pale skin and luminous eyes made her a reigning Hollywood beauty of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 87 and lived in Palm Springs, Calif.         Miss Young, who won an Oscar as best actress for her performance in ''The Farmer's Daughter'' in 1947, later became a favorite of television viewers as the glowing star who twirled onto the stage in a designer gown each week to introduce an uplifting drama on ''The Loretta Young Show.'' She retired almost 40 years ago and never returned to the big screen.         Miss Young died at the home of her sister, Georgiana Montalban, the wife of the actor Ricardo Montalban, said Norman Brokaw, the chairman of the William Morris agency and her agent for 50 years. The cause was ovarian cancer, he said.         Hers was an art learned early in life. She first appeared on screen at age 4 as a fairy in the silent film ''The Primrose Ring.'' In 1928, she became a leading lady, starring opposite Lon Chaney in ''Laugh, Clown, Laugh.'' In addition to ''The Farmer's Daughter,'' in which she played an effervescent Swedish-born maid who runs for Congress, she appeared in nearly 100 films, often in the arms of such matinee idols as Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Tyrone Power or Cary Grant.         Her movies included ''Taxi'' with James Cagney in 1932; ''Zoo in Budapest'' with Gene Raymond in 1933; ''Man's Castle'' with Tracy, also in 1933; ''Call of the Wild'' with Gable in 1935; ''The Stranger'' with Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson in 1946; and ''The Bishop's Wife'' with Grant in 1947.         Miss Young's screen image suggested a blend of virtuous poise, sensuality and vulnerability, and in fact, she once admitted to having had ''crushes'' on all of her leading men and to being ''susceptible'' to men in general. Reflecting on her appeal to moviegoers, she told Edward J. Funk, co-author of an unpublished autobiography:         ''My appeal wouldn't have been to the intellectuals or the neurotics. Nor to the shop girls and secretaries -- that would have been Joan Crawford's market. But there were an awful lot of women out there who were like me -- who were willing to play by the rules, didn't sleep around and were very aggressive. A Loretta Young movie had a happy ending; that's what it was geared to: a nice husband, nice lover, no abuse of any kind -- that's what the heroes and heroines were in those days.''         While Miss Young said she considered herself more of a ''movie star'' than an actress, she achieved her greatest popularity as the ''first lady'' of dramatic television, with ''The Loretta Young Show.'' In the half-hour anthology series, which ran on NBC from 1953 to 1961, Miss Young played characters from Queen Nefertiti to a nightclub singer. A trademark of the show was her glamorous entrance.         ''I did that to mollify the show's designer, Marusha,'' Miss Young said in a 1995 interview. ''I initially just walked through the doors, and Marusha was upset because no one would see the wonderful back of the dress.''         So Miss Young, who had studied ballet as a child, asked for a retake in which she entered the set and pirouetted before walking toward the camera. Viewers loved it.         The show at first was an audacious step for her, since at the time a fearful Hollywood was attacking television, a new medium and a formidable rival. Miss Young said friends and advisers warned her that if she appeared on television regularly she would be ''blackballed out of this business'' and ''never get another job.'' But she saw television as the ''wave of the future,'' and signed a contract with NBC and Procter & Gamble to produce and star in the dramatic series.         Miss Young appeared in 165 episodes. A devout Catholic, she ended each show by delivering a homily to the audience. Her show extolled ''respect for law and order and for disciplined deportment and character-building standards,'' she said in her 1961 memoir, ''The Things I Had to Learn,'' written with Helen Ferguson. ''Above all, we want to prove the strength, the good, really, of people.''         Although critics derided the moralistic melodramas as ''Sunday night soap opera,'' the series became one of the most popular on television, earning Miss Young millions of dollars and a reputation as one of the best businesswomen in Hollywood.         In 1972, she was awarded $559,000 by a jury in a breach-of-contract suit against NBC in which she contended that the network had humiliated her through the overseas release of introductory and closing segments of the show showing her in outmoded gowns and hairstyles.         She won the first of three Emmy Awards in 1953, which made her the first actress to win both an Oscar and an Emmy. The annual poll of TV-Radio Mirror readers earned her six consecutive gold medals as their favorite actress, and an episode of the series received the first television Grand Prix at the 1959 Cannes International Film Festival. The series was revived in 1962 as ''The New Loretta Young Show'' and ran for a year.         In 1995, Nostalgia Television, a national cable network, began reruns of the original show, the rights to which Miss Young had turned over to her son, Christopher Lewis, and his wife, Linda, who are film producers.         Perhaps the biggest controversy in her long career arose years after she left the screen. In 1994, her adopted daughter, Judy Lewis, maintained in an autobiography, ''Uncommon Knowledge,'' that she was the daughter of Miss Young and Clark Gable and that she was conceived during the making of ''Call of the Wild,'' in which the two starred.         In 1935 when the film was made, Miss Young was single and Gable was married to Ria Langham. Miss Lewis said that Miss Young was terrified that a scandal would end her career and Gable's, and that she had arranged to give birth in secret, taking more than a year off from work and citing an unspecified illness. Later, Miss Lewis asserted, Miss Young arranged her ''adoption,'' retrieving her from an orphanage where she had been temporarily placed.         For years, Miss Young refused to confirm or deny her daughter's account, dismissing it as ''a rumor from a bygone era.'' After the book's release, mother and daughter did not speak to each other for months.         Mr. Brokaw said yesterday, ''She didn't want to ever publicly acknowledge it.''         Miss Young, whose given name was Gretchen Michaela, was born on Jan. 6, 1913, in Salt Lake City. When she was 2 her parents separated, and her mother moved with her daughters and son, Jack, to Hollywood. She borrowed $1,000 from a Roman Catholic bishop, persuaded a department store to let her have furniture on credit and opened a boardinghouse.         Miss Young attended a convent school and began appearing as a child extra in movies, often working with her older sisters, Polly Ann and Betty Jane.         First National Studio signed her to a contract at age 14, put braces on her teeth and renamed her Loretta, a change she gladly accepted as evidence that she was on her way to becoming a star.         In 1930, at 17, Miss Young eloped with Grant Withers, her co-star in the film ''The Second-Story Murder.'' The marriage was annulled the following year. In 1940, she married Thomas H. A. Lewis, an advertising executive who later became a producer of her television series. The couple, who divorced in 1969, had two sons, Christopher, a producer, and Peter, a guitarist and songwriter.         Strong-willed, independent and rebellious, Miss Young was among the first female stars to command a six-figure salary. In 1939, when she rejected a five-year, $2 million contract with 20th Century Fox to try working as a freelance actress, she was blackballed by the studios. She made only one film, ''Eternally Yours,'' with David Niven, during the next two years.         She owned the rights to ''The Loretta Young Show'' and had control over its content, casting and final editing. And she paid strict attention to the show's moral tone.         During the filming for one episode, ''Come to the Stable,'' about two nuns who come to the United States from France to build a hospital for children, Miss Young became so disturbed by swearing on the set that she came up with the idea of a ''swear box.'' Cast and crew had to contribute up to 25 cents for each offense, and the money was donated to a home for unmarried mothers.         In 1963, at age 50, with movie offers still coming her way, Miss Young left show business. She later acknowledged that her retirement was perhaps premature and that she had always intended to resume her career. Although she was offered more than 150 parts, her last major role was that of an owner of a fashion magazine in ''Lady in the Corner,'' a 1989 television drama.         She lived an almost reclusive life and was rarely interviewed or photographed, although she occasionally appeared in public to promote one of her favorite charities. Her later years were quietly shared with her third husband, Jean Louis, a designer for Columbia Pictures, whom she married in 1994. Mr. Louis won an Oscar of his own in 1956 for his designs for ''The Solid Gold Cadillac.''         Mr. Louis died in 1997. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Montalban, Miss Young is survived by her three children.         Miss Young said that her faith sustained her through the difficult times in her life and that her mother had given her an invaluable sense of worth, independence and flair. In her memoir, she wrote: ''I believe that if we have lived our lives fully and well, and have accomplished, at least in part, the things which we were put here to do, we will be prepared -- mentally, spiritually and physically -- for our separation from this world.''

         Mary K. Wells, who acted in films, theater, television and radio and was part of a writing team that won two daytime Emmy Awards, died on Monday. She was 79 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was an infection of the colon, said her son, Cameron Richardson.         Miss Wells, whose childhood ambition was to become an actress, began her career in small roles in Hollywood films like ''Here Come the Waves'' (1944) and ''The Searching Wind'' (1946). But on the advice of a Paramount Pictures casting director who advised her that sustained performance, rather than a burst of personality, was her forte, Miss Wells moved to New York in 1948.         Arriving in the heyday of radio, the infancy of television and maturity of Broadway, she embarked on a career that endured until her retirement in 1993.         Her television credits included classics of the 1950's like ''Big Town,'' in which she played Lorelei Kilbourne, a crusading reporter for The Illustrated Press in the 1950-51 season; the ''Philco TV Playhouse''; ''Playhouse 90''; ''Robert Montgomery Presents; and ''The Milton Berle Show.''         In theater she appeared in plays  like George Abbott's ''Three Men on a Horse,'' with Sam Levene and Jack Gilford; in Edward Albee's ''Everything in the Garden''; and in ''Any Wednesday'' with Gene Hackman and Sandy Dennis.         From 1961 to 1970 she played the role of Louise Capice, an upper-class suburban wife on the daytime soap opera ''The Edge of Night.'' In 1974 she joined the writing staff of the ABC soap opera ''All My Children.'' She was part of the teams that won Emmys for outstanding drama series writing for the 1984-85 and 1987-88 season.         Miss Wells, who was born in Omaha, on Dec. 1, 1920, was reared in Los Angeles by her divorced mother, Mary Ludwig Wells. Miss Wells said that from the age of 5 she wanted to become an actress, and when she grew up she managed to get an audition at Paramount, which led to her career.         Her marriage to Donald Richardson, a television director, ended in divorce.         In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a  daughter, Katherine O'Keeffe of Kent, Ohio, and four grandchildren.       
         Sally Amato, a singer and actress who founded the Amato Opera with her husband, the conductor Anthony Amato, died on Wednesday at her home in City Island in the Bronx. She was 82.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. Amato was in many ways the welcoming face of her family-run opera company. An operagoer was greeted by her at the door of the tiny Amato theater on the Bowery, and would then proceed down a flight of stairs or into the balcony, where Mr. Amato would conduct, stopping at intermission to draw raffles out of a barrel and award prizes to audience members. The company became a home for enthusiasts on both sides of the footlights: amateur singers (and some who became professionals) go there to learn and perform the great works and occasional rarities, and opera lovers on tight budgets go there to hear their favorite scores.         Mrs. Amato was born Serafina Bellantone in Manhattan in 1917. She began her performing career as a child, when she and her sisters performed vaudeville skits in movie theaters, and she continued to work as an actress and singer into the first decades of the Amato Opera, which she and her husband started in 1948.         She met Mr. Amato in 1943, when they were both performing at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. The meeting itself was not auspicious: Mr. Amato and Ms. Bellantone had been cast as American Indians, and in one scene Mr. Amato was to throw his future wife to the floor and kick her. But she was charmed by his expressions of concern when the scene ended. She also said that she admired his tenor voice.         The Amatos married in 1945, and continued to work together at the American Theater Wing, where Mr. Amato directed workshops. They also shared an abiding love of opera, and it occurred to them soon after World War II that a company was needed to provide opportunities for aspiring singers returning from military service. The Amato Opera gave its first performances in the basement of Our Lady of Pompeii Church in Greenwich Village. The company later moved to 159 Bleecker Street; in 1963 it took over the jewel box theater at the corner of the Bowery and Second Street that has been its home ever since.         Mrs. Amato performed with the company under her maiden name for several seasons, but she increasingly took on many of the house's nonmusical jobs. She made many of the company's costumes, ran its box office, and operated its lighting board.         Mrs. Amato is survived by her husband and a sister, Ann Frydel, of Manhattan.       
         Renee Orin, an actress and singer known for her roles in Broadway musicals, died on Sunday in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Los Angeles.         She had lymphoma, said her husband, Albert Hague, a Tony-winning composer of Broadway musicals.         Ms. Orin made her Broadway debut in the 1955 musical ''Plain and Fancy,'' which her husband composed. Her Broadway credits also  include ''Finian's Rainbow.''         She was called ''a singer with a lovely voice and a charming, ingratiating personality,'' by the jazz critic John S. Wilson in a 1976 review in The New York Times of a program of songs sung by her and her husband at the Ballroom nightclub.         Born in Slatington, Pa., she received a bachelor's degree in drama from Carnegie Tech.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Janet Hague of Portland, Ore., and a son, Andrew Hague of Manhattan.       
         Dawn Langley Simmons, an author whose tumultuous life included a sex change operation and an interracial marriage that scandalized her adopted hometown, Charleston, S.C., died on Sept. 18 at her daughter's home there. She was 77.         Mrs. Simmons, who was the adopted child of the English actress Margaret Rutherford, had Parkinson's disease, said her daughter, Natasha.         Mrs. Simmons was the author of more than 20 books, including novels, biographies, and books for her children. Several of her books understandably touched on her life experiences, given a journey that started on an English estate, touched down on an Indian reservation and stirred deep turmoil in civil-rights-era Charleston.         Jack Hitt, a journalist who grew up in Charleston across the street from Mrs. Simmons and wrote about her for GQ magazine, remembered her as a figure with a piercing stare, a pillbox hat and ''a Dippity-Do hairstyle -- a dowdy doppelganger of Jackie Kennedy.''         Mrs. Simmons was a person around whom legends swirled, Mr. Hitt said. She lived in a grand house filled with antiques and with a hidden garden. She was said to have had a coming-out party for two of her dogs, who were displayed on velvet cushions in the living room, dressed in chenille, long gloves and pearls.         Mrs. Simmons was named Gordon Langley Hall when she was born, at Sissinghurst, the estate of the writer Vita Sackville-West, in Heathfield, Sussex, England. Gordon was the illegitimate child of Jack Copper, Sackville-West's chauffeur (a grandfather was Rudyard Kipling's gardener) and Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, who came, Mrs. Simmons always said, from a high social class.         Mrs. Simmons said she was born with an adrenal abnormality that causes the female genitalia to resemble a man's and was thus raised as a boy. She always maintained that she was -- unequivocally -- female.         As a boy, young Gordon played with Sackville-West's son, Nigel Nicolson. Mr. Nicolson remembered Gordon in a telephone conversation from England last Friday. ''We called him 'Dinky,' and I always think of him that way,'' he said, adding that young Gordon always looked like a boy.         At Sissinghurst, the young Gordon met Virginia Woolf, Ms. Sackville-West's lover and the author of ''Orlando,'' a novel about a boy who changes into a beautiful woman. ''Had she lived a little longer, Vita would have been intrigued to know that the child 'Dinky,' as she called me, would become a real-life Orlando,'' Mrs. Simmons wrote in her memoir, ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend,''(1995, Wyrick & Company).         In his late teens, Mr. Hall emigrated to Ontario, where he worked as a missionary, teacher and midwife among the Ojibwa Indians, according to his book about his experiences, ''Me Papoose Sitter'' (Crowell, 1955). He became an editor for The Winnipeg Free Press, and from 1953 to 1956 was society editor of The Nevada Daily Mail in Missouri. Mr. Nicolson said he was ''a very good journalist.''         He also wrote books about Princess Margaret, Jacqueline Kennedy and American Evangelism. According to the reference work ''Contemporary Authors,'' a critic named W. H. Archer praised Mr. Hall's ''Rose for Mrs. Lincoln: A Biography of Mary Todd Lincoln'' (Beacon Press, 1970), calling it ''scrupulously researched'' and written in ''a charmingly premeditated style.''         In New York in his 20's, Mr. Hall met Margaret Rutherford, who became enchanted with him and, with her husband, Stringer Davis, adopted him.         In that period Mr. Hall also befriended the painter Isabel Whitney, who left him $2 million at her death in 1962, he said. Around that time, he moved to Charleston, settling into a faded 1840 house on Society Street in the Ansonborough section, which had a large gay population. He became friendly with Charleston's grandes dames, restored his house and filled it with Chippendale furniture, mirrors said to belong to George Washington, and bed steps said to have been owned by Robert E. Lee.         In 1968 he underwent a sex change operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and became Dawn Pepita Langley Hall.         The following year Dawn Hall married her 22-year-old black butler, John-Paul Simmons. The publisher of ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' was quoted as calling it the first documented interracial marriage in Charleston's history. A bomb threat forced the couple to move the wedding from a Baptist church to the bride's home, and the gifts were destroyed by a firebomb.         In England, Miss Rutherford was reported to have said, ''I am delighted that Gordon has become a woman, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of another race, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of a lower station, but I understand the man is a Baptist!''         Soon, Mrs. Simmons appeared to be pregnant. Then in 1972, she began strolling with a baby carriage bearing a little girl whom she called Natasha.         That was the final straw for many people in Charleston. Mrs. Simmons claimed that a white man broke into her house wearing a ski mask and beat her, breaking her nose and foot and necessitating hospitalization.         She also said that her husband beat her. In 1974, after a period of turbulence in which she accused her husband of selling her belongings to buy whisky, the family moved to Catskill, N.Y. Some time later, Mr. Simmons was confined to a mental institution near Albany. His daughter says he is now an outpatient.         Mrs. Simmons spent most of her later years in Hudson, N.Y., where she was an active member of a local Episcopal church and a leader of its youth group. She continued to support her husband and daughter on her meager earnings as a writer.         Her daughter said she would prefer not to discuss her mother's past. ''I would like her to be remembered as the grandmother that she was, as a family woman,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''She was devoted to my children.''         In addition to her husband and daughter, Mrs. Simmons is survived by three grandchildren.         After she published ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' in 1995, her childhood friend, Mr. Nicolson, reminisced about her in The Spectator. ''I have maligned her in the past, mocked her strange fate and refused to meet her,'' he wrote.         ''She had asked me for help in arranging an English marriage,'' he wrote, ''and when she called on me, I hid.'' On a trip to Charleston, he avoided meeting her, but saw her on television. ''I saw on the wall behind her photographs of my mother,'' he continued. ''For the first time I was touched.''         But ''there is not a word of reproach for me in her book,'' Mr. Nicolson marveled. ''Like everything else about Dinky, it is gallant, resilient and unfailingly generous.''       
         Beah Richards, whose distinguished career as an actress on stage, screen and television over 50 years was capped this month when she won an Emmy as a guest actor on ''The Practice,'' died on Thursday in Vicksburg, Miss. She was 80. She was born in Vicksburg and lived in Los Angeles until Memorial Day, when she returned to her home city.         Ms. Richards's characters were exemplars of stalwart, soulful women: Sister Margaret, the pastor of a storefront church in James Baldwin's play ''The Amen Corner''; Mr. Poitier's mother in ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner'' (a role for which she was nominated for an Academy Award); Baby Suggs, a former slave who becomes a spiritual leader, in the film version of Toni Morrison's ''Beloved.''         As she once said, ''I have played everybody's mother.'' In addition to Mr. Poitier, her ''sons'' included James Earl Jones, Danny Glover, Delroy Lindo and Eriq LaSalle.         In 1959 she was the understudy to Claudia McNeil as Lena Younger in the original Broadway production of Lorraine Hansberry's ''Raisin in the Sun'' and went on to play the role in the 25th-anniversary production of the play at the Yale Repertory Theater.         Lena Younger was, in fact, an archetypal Richards character, a woman who bravely moves from a slum into a lily white community in Chicago. With the conviction of a Rosa Parks, she leads her family into block-busting not as an act of revolution but as her birthright. It is simply time for a change. As this urban pioneer, Ms. Richards was indomitable but not overbearing, creating a deeply moving portrait exactly as large as life. In this production, directed by Dennis Scott, Mr. Lindo played the son, Walter Lee Younger, a role created by Mr. Poitier, and Mary Alice was her daughter-in-law.         In 1984 she was Mr. Glover's mother in ''And the Children Shall Lead'' on the PBS ''Wonderworks'' series. Her role was that of a woman who worked as a maid for a sheriff in a small Southern town. When civil rights workers raise her consciousness, she confronts her employer, and he fires her. As was generally the case with Ms. Richards's characters, she rises to the challenge.         Ms. Richards was the daughter of a Baptist minister and a seamstress. Many years later she spoke of being insulted and stoned by white children as she walked to school. As she said, ''I suffered every day in my life in that town.''         She studied at Dillard University in New Orleans and in 1948 began her acting career at the Old Globe Theater in San Diego. Moving to New York, she was in the long-running Off Broadway revival of Louis Peterson's ''Take a Giant Step,'' with Bill Gunn, Frances Foster, Rosetta LeNoire and Godfrey Cambridge. When the play was filmed, Ms. Richards repeated her role as the grandmother.         Her first Broadway role was in ''The Miracle Worker,'' followed by ''Purlie Victorious.'' Then came ''The Amen Corner,'' in which she played in Los Angeles as well as in New York. She was in Mike Nichols's production of ''The Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center and also performed a one-woman show, ''A Black Woman Speaks.''         Ms. Richards's films included ''Hurry Sundown,'' ''Drugstore Cowboy'' and ''The Great White Hope'' (as the mother of the boxer Jack Jefferson, played by Mr. Jones). She won an Emmy in 1988 for a guest appearance on ''Frank's Place'' and was in ''Roots: the Next Generation'' and ''The Bill Cosby Show.'' On ''E.R.,'' she had a running role as Mr. La Salle's mother.         She was divorced from Hugh Harrell, an artist. There are no immediate survivors.         Looking back to her childhood as the daughter of a minister, Ms. Richards said: ''I always relate the theater to the church. There is the sharpness of image, the poetry. And like the church, the theater must always be an exploration for truth.''       
         Ann Doran, a character actress who appeared in hundreds of movies and television shows over the course of a career that began during the silent film era and lasted into the 1980's, died on Sept. 19 in Carmichael, Calif. She was 89.         Ms. Doran's more memorable roles included a panicky passenger aboard a disabled airliner in ''The High and the Mighty'' (1954), whose cast included John Wayne and Claire Trevor, and James Dean's tormented mother in ''Rebel Without a Cause'' (1955). She was a regular in the series of films based on the comic strip ''Blondie,'' which starred Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake.         Her film credits also included  ''Penny Serenade,'' with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne; ''Here Come the Waves,'' with Bing Crosby and Betty Hutton; ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers,'' with Barbara Stanwyck and Van Heflin; ''My Favorite Brunette,'' with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour; and ''No Sad Songs for Me,'' with Margaret Sullavan.         Ms. Doran, who was born in Amarillo, Tex., was the daughter of Carrie Barnett, an actress who appeared in silent films and had her child performing in front of the cameras almost as soon as she could walk. By the time Ms. Doran reached her 20's, she was ready for any role that came her way.       
         Jean Peters, a 20th Century Fox contract player whose unpretentious beauty earned her leading roles in some of the top films of the late 1940's and early 50's before she abandoned her career and practically disappeared from view after a secretive marriage to the billionaire Howard Hughes, died on Oct. 13 at her home in Carlsbad, Calif. She was 73.         The cause was leukemia, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Peters, who was known as  Pete during her acting years, was a lead actress from the moment she arrived in Hollywood at the age of 21 after winning a Miss Ohio State beauty contest whose prizes included a Fox screen test.         The studio quickly offered her a seven-year contract. Within months of being driven cross-country by her widowed mother, the owner of a tourist camp outside their hometown, Canton, Ms. Peters was chosen as the female lead in the lavish epic ''Captain from Castille,'' opposite Tyrone Power.         Though never considered one of Hollywood's great actresses, the green-eyed, fresh-faced Ms. Peters had a straightforward naturalness on camera that made her a favorite leading lady of some of the top stars of the period.         She appeared with Ray Milland in the baseball comedy ''It Happens Every Spring'' (1949), and with Marlon Brando in Elia Kazan's ''Viva Zapata!'' (1952), Richard Widmark in Sam Fuller's ''Pickup on South Street'' (1953), Joseph Cotten and Marilyn Monroe in ''Niagara'' (1953), Spencer Tracy in ''Broken Lance'' (1954), Burt Lancaster in ''Apache'' (1954) and, perhaps most memorably, as one of three American women in Rome in Jean Negulesco's ''Three Coins in the Fountain'' (1954).         Many remarked at the time on Ms. Peters's informal off-camera style,  avoiding Hollywood night life and the networking scene in the studio commissary for private picnics with her hairdresser and makeup artist on the floor of a dark set.         She was most often seen without makeup and wearing jeans and simple shirts. She lived in a rented bungalow decorated with watercolors she had painted herself. The studio publicity machine painted her as an Ohio farm girl and a bit of a tomboy baseball fan, an image that was difficult to reconcile with the sculptured beauty who appeared on the screen.         ''Back home, I still have 3 dogs, 18 cats, a goat named Josephine and a lamb called Ali Baba,'' she told an interviewer in 1948.         To another, in 1949, she remarked: ''I don't like servants or big houses, and I'd hate to waste my time playing bridge in the afternoons. I think women need to cook and sew.''         Shortly after arriving in Hollywood, Ms. Peters met and began a quiet relationship with the reclusive Hughes -- also famous for his ostentatiously unpretentious wardrobe -- and for a decade the couple dated, usually getting together once a week, often to watch movies until late into the evening in one of Hughes's screening rooms. Among his holdings at the time were RKO Studios, Trans World Airlines, Hughes Aircraft and the Hughes Tool Company.         She was rarely seen in public and never in the company of another man, though Hughes was often seen on the town with some of the top actresses of the day. Because of the long nature of their relationship, there were frequent rumors that the couple had secretly wed.         For a few months, in 1954, Ms. Peters was married to Stanley W. Cramer 3rd, a Texas oil executive, but it ended in divorce and, like all of her marriages, without children. It was in 1957 that another rumor arose of a secret wedding between Hughes and Ms. Peters. This time it was true. The couple had married in a private ceremony in Tonapah, Nev.         Ms. Peters, whose final movie was ''A Man Called Peter'' (1955), retired from film acting and was rarely seen in public during the 13 years she remained married to Hughes. Neither granted interviews.         Over the years, Ms. Peters established herself in a remote, hilltop mansion in Bel Air while her husband, growing ever more reclusive and secretive, adjourned to the penthouses above a Las Vegas casino where he passed most of the last decades of his life.         They would still get together once a week or so, usually watching movies in Hughes's sanctuary.         An acquaintance, D. L. Lyons, a writer for The Ladies' Home Journal, described Ms. Peters's cloistered life in the late 1960's when he tried to visit her. ''At that time, in 1968, very much married to Howard, she lived in splendid solitude on Bel Air Road, atop a peak of the Santa Monica Mountains, under 24-hour surveillance of guards who followed her everywhere,'' he wrote.         By 1970, with her marriage disintegrating, Ms. Peters moved to a smaller house in Beverly Hills, let the guards go and even began to appear in public, attending movie screenings and going to restaurants.         Shortly after her divorce became final in 1971 she was married for a third time, to Stanley Hough, vice president and director for production operations at 20th Century Fox. Mr. Hough died in 1996, and Ms. Peters  moved to be closer to her sister in Carlsbad, a suburb of San Diego.         According to reports at the time of her divorce from Hughes, Ms. Peters had agreed as part of the settlement not to discuss their private life together and not to return to movies, at least as long as the billionaire was alive.         In 1976, though, shortly after his death, Ms. Peters made her first screen appearances in two decades, playing roles in a television mini-series, ''Arthur Hailey's The Moneychangers,'' and in a public television production of ''Winesburg, Ohio.''         In 1981 she had a role in another television film, ''Peter and Paul.''  After that, she made only rare guest appearances on television series like ''Murder, She Wrote.''         A friend, Arlen Hurwitz, once recalled how Ms. Peters reacted to the attention of fans during the height of her career in the late 1940's. ''Whenever fans stop Jean on our wanderings, she has her own patented way of handling them,'' Ms. Hurwitz said.         ''They say, 'Are you Jean Peters?' and she frowns and asks in a puzzled voice, 'Who is Jean Peters?' It always works. They go off looking bewildered and we go on about our business.''       
         Gwen Verdon, whose high-kicking artistry, flaming red hair and head-turning figure made her an unforgettable presence in musicals like ''Can-Can,'' ''Damn Yankees'' and ''Chicago,'' died yesterday in Woodstock, Vt. She was 75 and had homes in Bronxville, N.Y., and Quogue, N.Y.         She died at the home of her daughter, Nicole Fosse.         Widely regarded as the best dancer ever to brighten the Broadway stage, Ms. Verdon was also a performer who brought more than physical excitement to her roles. A highly capable actress as well as an exceptional dancer, she was adept at enriching the characters she played. Whether oozing seductive come-ons as the Devil's sexy troubleshooter in ''Damn Yankees'' or brooding over a whiskey as a disillusioned prostitute in a waterfront dive in ''New Girl in Town,'' a musical adaptation of  O'Neill's ''Anna Christie,'' she always reached for, and found, her character's heart.         The League of American Theaters and Producers said yesterday that the lights of Broadway's marquees would be dimmed in her memory at 8 p.m. last night.         Ms. Verdon's first Broadway success was explosive. In 1953 she auditioned for the Cole Porter musical ''Can-Can,'' and won a part as a featured dancer in the show, which was written and directed by Abe Burrows and had choreography by Michael Kidd. The show's star was the temperamental French actress and singer Lilo, who was not amused by the way audiences were applauding this redheaded newcomer during out-of-town tryouts and who saw to it that Ms. Verdon's part was cut back. Ms. Verdon, in turn, was disgusted enough to announce that she was quitting the show, and maybe even giving up dancing.         But on opening night on Broadway,  she delivered a fiery Apache dance that brought the audience to its feet -- and kept them there. She was already back in her dressing room for a costume change when one of the producers came pounding in to tell her that the audience was chanting her name and cheering and that she had to come back for a curtain call so that the show could continue. She took her bows, wearing a bathrobe, and knew she had arrived. Brooks Atkinson, in his review in The New York Times, cheered the ''impudence, recklessness and humor'' of her dancing and called her ''the practical star of the show.'' It was a late arrival for a dancer -- she was 28 and had been performing since the age of 3 -- but it was unforgettable.         ''Can-Can'' made Ms. Verdon a marquee name and brought her her first Tony Award. Nevertheless, she left the show before it ended its run and returned to working with the Hollywood choreographer Jack Cole, whose assistant she had been in the early 1950's. She was working on a film with Cole when she was approached by the producers of a new Broadway musical to be called ''Damn Yankees.'' Written by George Abbott and Douglass Wallop, the story centered on a Faustian deal made by a passionate baseball fan who agrees to sell his soul to the Devil for the chance to help his beloved Washington Senators beat the New York Yankees.         A Life and Career Linked to Fosse         The show had music and lyrics by Richard Adler and Jerry Ross and was to be directed by Abbott. Ms. Verdon was offered the part of Lola, the Devil's No. 1 helper. She wasn't eager to return to Broadway despite her success in ''Can-Can,'' but finally signed on. It would be her first experience with an up-and-coming choreographer named Bob Fosse, fresh from his first Broadway success with ''The Pajama Game.''         From that point on, Ms. Verdon's life and career were inextricably linked to Fosse. She was to become the living embodiment of his work on Broadway, and he in turn became her mentor, her lover and eventually her husband. Fosse soon found that working with Ms. Verdon was more of a collaboration than a tutorial. ''The happiest times I ever had with Gwen were when we were working together'' he said in an interview in 1971. ''They stimulated all sorts of things.''         For Ms. Verdon, working with Fosse provided ''direction like I've never had in my life.'' Years later, looking back on that experience, she recalled how ''Bob choreographs down to the second joint of your little finger.''         ''Damn Yankees'' opened to bravos in May 1955. Ms. Verdon's co-stars were Ray Walston as the Devil and Stephen Douglass as the hapless fan who is transformed into the home-run-hitting Joe Hardy. As Lola, Ms. Verdon brought the house down with her slinky rendition of ''Whatever Lola Wants,'' a locker-room seduction scene in which her sultry yet playful striptease for Shoeless Joe was hot enough to tempt the Devil himself. ''Damn Yankees'' racked up over a thousand performances and brought Ms. Verdon her second Tony. It was an impressive showing for a performer who spent her early childhood years laced into orthopedic boots to correct legs that had been weakened and deformed by a series of illnesses.         Gwyneth Evelyn Verdon was born on Jan. 16, 1925, in Culver City, Calif. Her parents were British expatriates. Her mother, Gertrude, had been a member of Denishawn, the influential modern dance troupe.Her father, Joseph, was an electrician at MGM. Show business was part of the household, and baby Gwyneth was pointed toward the stage from the time she could walk. When she wasn't wearing those knee-high corrective boots, she was being taught basic ballet, ballroom dancing and learning how to tap and do the old soft-shoe. At age 6, she was already performing in theaters where she was billed as ''the fastest little tapper in the world.'' By the time she graduated from high school, her career seemed well on its way.         But then, at 17, she eloped with a writer for The Hollywood Reporter, James Henaghan. The marriage lasted five years, until Mr. Henaghan's freewheeling lifestyle brought it to an end. The couple had a son, Jimmy, and after the divorce Ms. Verdon left him in the care of her parents and resumed her career.         She auditioned for Cole and was hired by the talented, ferociously  abrasive dance director. She became a member of Cole's troupe for five years and made her Broadway debut in his 1950 flop, ''Alive and Kicking.'' Cole's connections with Hollywood studios brought her work as a ''specialty dancer'' in several films, including ''On the Riviera.'' She also coached stars like Jane Russell in the art of moving sexily on screen.         When Mr. Kidd made his offer of a part in ''Can-Can,'' she was weary of anonymity, weary of Cole -- a perfectionist given to tantrums -- and ready to leave Hollywood for a second chance at success on Broadway. She wouldn't be seen on screen again until 1958, when she got star billing opposite Tab Hunter in the film adaptation of ''Damn Yankees.''         Ms. Verdon's fourth Broadway show was ''New Girl in Town,'' based on O'Neill's bleak tale about a waterfront prostitute's redemption through love. Directed by Abbott, with music and lyrics by Bob Merrill and choreography by Bob Fosse, ''New Girl in Town'' opened in May 1957 with Ms. Verdon in the title role. Brooks Atkinson called her performance ''sobering and admirable'' but found the show an uneasy blend of the antic and tragic. Nevertheless, Ms. Verdon came away with Tony No. 3, which she shared with her co-star, Thelma Ritter.         The musical that became the perfect showcase for Ms. Verdon's gifts as both dancer and actress was also the first of her shows to be both choreographed and directed by Fosse. The 1959 ''Redhead,'' which had music by Albert Hague and lyrics by Dorothy Fields had been written for the British music hall star Beatrice Lillie. But Ms. Lillie turned out to be otherwise engaged and Ms. Verdon agreed to star on the condition that Fosse be the director.         Ms. Verdon was cast as Essie Whimple, a shy worker in a London waxworks museum. It was a role in which she had ample opportunity to display her acting talent. And in the dances created for her by Fosse, she did everything from a tango to a ragtime strut, from Chaplinesque comedy to a brassy music-hall routine.She won another Tony Award, her fourth.         The following year, when ''Redhead'' was on tour in Chicago, Miss Verdon and Fosse were married, and by the time the tour reached Los Angeles she had decided to retire from show business with the intention of concentrating on family life. In 1963 their daughter, Nicole, was born. She is also survived by her son, Jimmy Henaghan of Los Angeles; four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.         Dance-Hall Hostess With Heart         It wasn't until 1966 that Ms. Verdon returned to the stage, in ''Sweet Charity.'' The musical had its unlikely roots in Fellini's film classic ''Nights of Cabiria.'' Once again, Fosse was director and choreographer. Ms. Verdon played the role immortalized by Giulietta Masina although the character had been changed from a Roman prostitute to a New York dance-hall hostess.         Even though the critics were less than ecstatic about ''Sweet Charity,'' Ms. Verdon was given numbers like ''Hey, Big Spender'' that added to her legend as a peerless performer on Broadway. The musical ran for more than 600 performances and became something of a cult favorite long after it closed. But increasing fatigue led Ms. Verdon to surrender the lead to Helen Gallagher before the show's run ended. When the 1968 Hollywood film version was being cast, Ms. Verdon lost out to the younger Shirley MacLaine.         Meanwhile, Fosse's open infidelities were disrupting their marriage, and by 1971 the couple were legally separated although they continued to work together on occasion and were never divorced.         A Chance To Play Roxie         In 1972, with her career as a dancer clearly drawing to a close, Ms. Verdon tried her hand at a thriller called ''Children! Children!'' which quickly flopped. But there was one more Broadway musical waiting in the wings and it would reunite Ms. Verdon and Fosse once again, onstage if not in marriage.         ''Chicago,'' which began life as a stage play in the 20's and then became a vehicle for Ginger Rogers in the 1942 film ''Roxie Hart,'' was a show Ms. Verdon had wanted to do for years. When Fosse decided to take it on as a musical, and John Kander and Fred Ebb signed on to write the score, Ms. Verdon at last got her chance to play Roxie, a woman jailed, tried and acquitted for shooting her lover.         When it opened in 1975, ''Chicago'' won applause for its three leads, Ms. Verdon, Chita Rivera and Jerry Orbach. Clive Barnes in The Times saluted ''three superlative, knock-em-in-the-aisles performances by three stars who glitter like gold dust all evening,'' but most of the critics found it too determinedly seedy and cynical for its own good. It proved to be Ms. Verdon's farewell to Broadway. Her successor in the role was Ann Reinking, Fosse's companion, who also restaged Fosse's choreography for the show's highly successful revival in 1996.         At Fosse's request, Ms. Verdon served as superviser of his 1978 musical, ''Dancin,' '' and also worked with him on his 1979 autobiographical film, ''All That Jazz.''         In 1983 Ms. Verdon appeared in a made-for-television movie, ''Legs,'' as the choreographer of the Rockettes. Her television appearances included ABC's daytime serial ''All My Children.''         The urge to perform also drew her back to Hollywood in the 1980's. She had a small role ''The Cotton Club'' (1984), and was part of a lauded acting ensemble in ''Cocoon'' (1985).         In 1999 she made an offstage return to Broadway as the artistic adviser for the musical ''Fosse,'' a compilation of highlights from his career. Ms. Verdon was with Fosse in 1987 when he died of a heart attack at age 60 on a Washington sidewalk, minutes after the opening of the revival of ''Sweet Charity,'' which she had helped him reconstruct. She attended to his funeral and, despite their many marital difficulties and years of separation, wholeheartedly assumed the duties of devoted widow, nourishing and helping to preserve his dance legacy, in which she had played such a vital role.         Their collaboration was relatively brief, but remarkably productive and intensely shared. Reflecting on their years together in an interview before Fosse's death, she said: ''I was a great dancer when he got hold of me, but he developed me, he created me.'' She made the most of it.         Correction:  October 24, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the Broadway dancer Gwen Verdon on Thursday misstated the title of a song in the 1966 musical ''Sweet Charity'' and misattributed the performance. The title was ''Big Spender,'' not ''Hey, Big Spender,'' and the performance was by a group of dancers, not by Ms. Verdon.       
         Julie London, whose understated voice and striking honey-blond appearance made her one of the top female vocalists of the 1950's and 60's, died yesterday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 74.         Miss London, who lived in the San Fernando Valley, suffered a stroke five years ago and was in poor health, a spokesman for Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical Center told The Associated Press.         She was also an actress in scores of movies and television shows, including the popular role of Nurse Dixie McCall in ''Emergency!'' in the 1970's.         Miss London went from playing bit parts in the early 1940's to starring roles and pin-up status among World War II servicemen. Then, in 1947, she married the actor Jack Webb, later famous on ''Dragnet,'' and stopped working to be a full-time wife and mother. After they divorced five years later, she became a serious singer under the tutelage of Bobby Troupe, a jazz musician and songwriter.         Her first 45 single, released in 1955, was ''Cry Me a River,'' and it was included on her first album, ''Julie Is Her Name.'' More than three million copies of the album and single were sold. She made more than 30 albums.         She was voted one of the top female vocalists of 1955, 1956 and 1957. On New Year's Eve 1959, she married Mr. Troupe, who died last year.         Adjectives such as sexy, intimate, breathy, husky and suggestive were applied to her singing. The singer herself told Life magazine in 1957: ''It's only a thimbleful of a voice, and I have to use it close to the microphone. But it is a kind of oversmoked voice and it automatically sounds intimate.''         Her sound and her looks were closely intertwined. Most of her albums were graced by sultry, yet sophisticated pictures of her.         Miss London was born as Julie Peck in Santa Rosa, Calif., on Sept. 26, 1926. Her parents, Jack and Josephine Peck formed a song and dance team in vaudeville and radio. In 1929, they moved to San Bernardino, where her parents had a radio show on which Julie sometimes appeared. In 1941, they moved to Los Angeles and she graduated from Hollywood Professional High School.         She then took a job as an elevator operator in a department store where she was discovered by talent agent Sue Carol, the wife of the actor Alan Ladd. She appeared in her first film, ''Nabonga,'' in 1944, and began singing with the Matty Malnech Orchestra. She met Mr. Webb who was then in the Marine Corps. They married in 1947, and she gave up her budding movie career to become a full-time wife and mother.         They had two daughters, Stacy and Lisa. They divorced in 1953. After meeting Mr. Troupe she began singing again, recovering some of what she called sagging confidence.         Her movie career also revived. She starred as an alcoholic singer in the 1956 film ''The Great Man.'' She then starred or co-starred in ''Man of the West,'' ''Voice in the Mirror,'' ''The George Raft Story'' and ''The Third Voice.'' She composed the title song for ''Voice in the Mirror.''         In 1972, she began her role in ''Emergency!'' After the show ended in 1977, she did one last film before retiring from show business.         She is survived by a daughter from her marriage to Mr. Webb, Lisa Breen of Manhattan Beach, Calif. She also left three children from her 39-year marriage to Mr. Troupe: a daughter, Kelly Ronick, and twin sons, Jody and Reese, all of Los Angeles.         Correction:  October 23, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the singer and actress Julie London on Thursday misspelled the surname of her second husband, who died last year. He was Bobby Troup, not Troupe.       
         Mary Sinclair, an actress who was a familiar face to television viewers in the 1950's, died on Nov. 5 in Phoenix. She was 78 and lived in Phoenix.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         Ms. Sinclair, whom Life magazine called ''a hazel-eyed beauty,'' was born in San Diego and became a Los Angeles fashion model but forsook Hollywood for New York.         ''I was the arty type,'' she recalled in a 1951 interview with The New York Times. ''I wanted to go to New York and be a real actress.'' She made the move in 1944 and worked as a model and in summer stock.         In 1946 she married George Abbott, the Broadway producer and director. In the 40's she also began to acquire valuable experience as a freelance television actress, appearing on 36 programs in two years.         In 1951 Ms. Sinclair signed a seven-year CBS television contract. The Times reported that she was the first dramatic actress ''to enter video's incubator for hatching its own stars.'' Later that year, she divorced Mr. Abbott.         Ms. Sinclair usually played sweet, goody-goody characters on television. But not long after signing with CBS, she played quite different parts on three successive evenings: a vicious singer, a spiteful flapper and a libidinous shrew.         As a star, she appeared on many live drama programs, like ''The U.S. Steel Hour,'' ''Studio One'' and ''Playhouse 90,'' which had their heyday in the 50's. She was dazed by the number of men she had to kiss on-screen and said, ''I average two strangers a week.''         She also appeared with Charlton Heston in Paramount's 1953 Western  ''Arrowhead,'' but continued working in television and on the stage. In the 60's she faded from television screens. Later she became a painter of portraits, animals and flowers and lived in Europe and in Los Angeles, where she was a director of local theater productions.         She is survived by a brother.       
         Eugenia Rawls, a theater actress who portrayed Tallulah Bankhead and others in one-woman shows, died on Nov. 8 in Denver. She was 87.         A native of Macon, Ga., Miss Rawls first took the stage at age 4 in a local production of ''Madame Butterfly,'' encouraged by her grandmother and two aunts, with whom she lived during most of her early life. After attending Wesleyan College in Macon she made her Broadway debut in 1934 in Lillian Hellman's ''Children's Hour.''         As an understudy for the actress playing Bankhead's daughter in Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' in 1939, Miss Rawls met the woman who would become her mentor and lifelong friend. ''Who are you?'' Bankhead reportedly demanded. ''You look enough like me to be my own child.'' Weeks later, Miss Rawls was playing Alexandra to Bankhead's Regina Giddens on Broadway, after which they toured 104 American cities.         Bankhead was matron of honor at Miss Rawls's 1941 wedding to Donald Seawell, a lawyer and the founder and chairman of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, and she later became godmother to the couple's two children.         Miss Rawls performed in Lillian Smith's ''Strange Fruit''; with Jose Ferrer in ''The Shrike''; with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in ''The Great Sebastians''; in Noel Coward's ''Private Lives''; and in Tennessee Williams's ''Glass Menagerie.''         In 1971, three years after Bankhead's death, Miss Rawls developed ''Tallulah, a Memory.'' She performed the one-woman work at Lincoln Center, which commissioned it, at the Kennedy Center and the ANTA Playhouse in Los Angeles before turning it into a book in 1979.         In 1972, Miss Rawls became the first American actress to perform at the Abbey Theater in Dublin. She also developed two other solo shows in the 1970's: ''Affectionately Yours, Fanny Kemble'' and ''Women of the West,'' and published a volume of poetry, ''A Moment Ago,'' in 1984.         In her later years, she turned to television, appearing on ''As the World Turns'' and ''The Guiding Light.'' She read the signature work of Lillian Smith in the PBS production of ''Memory of a Large Christmas,'' first broadcast in 1996.         A new theater is to be named for her at the Auraria Higher Education Center, home to the University of Colorado at Denver, Metropolitan State College and Denver Community College.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Brook Ashley of Santa Barbara, Calif.; a son, Brockman Seawell of New York; two brothers, Hubert F. Rawls Jr. of Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Richard Russell Rawls of Fernandina Beach, Fla.; a sister, Dorothy Louise Rawls Tuttle of California; a granddaughter; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Mitchell, one of Broadway's best-known backstage bosses who parlayed her professional prowess and personal flair into a successful producing career, died on Friday in Manhattan. She was 81.         Ms. Mitchell hailed from the tough streets of Newark, and it showed in her decision to work as a stage manager, a thankless profession whose duties include everything from making sure that the actors' coffee is hot to untangling chorus girls involved in a dressing room brawl. In her own words, the only things Ms. Mitchell didn't have to worry about were ''singing the hit song or selling orange drink in the lobby.'' Everything else was in her bailiwick.         By all accounts, she was up to the job, acting as both strict taskmaster for her producers and an advocate for the actors in her shows, which included landmark American musicals like ''West Side Story,'' ''Gypsy,'' ''The King and I'' and ''Bells Are Ringing.''         Later, working with her longtime mentor, the director and producer Hal Prince, Ms. Mitchell also helped  produce ''Cabaret,'' ''Company'' and ''A Little Night Music,'' each of which won the Tony Award for best musical.         A theater fan from early childhood, Ms. Mitchell attended dance classes and subsequently spent several summers hoofing on the summer theater circuit. Her stage managing career began in 1943 while she was a chorus girl in a Shubert musical entitled ''Cocktails at 5.'' But the show was ''lousy,'' she said in a 1958 interview, so she took refuge as the second assistant stage manager.         Stage management quickly became her primary profession, and she soon found herself in charge of  shows with stars like Tallulah Bankhead, who once said that Ms. Mitchell would have been ''the most perfect person in the world if she could only play bridge.''         Although no longer a professional actress, Ms. Mitchell never lost her flair for the dramatic. A small brunette, she had a fondness for capes and mink and often wore them on her opening nights.         In 1949, she even took over a small role in the play ''Mister Roberts,'' with Henry Fonda, for a week when the actress playing the part went on vacation. And while Mr. Prince called her ''the chic-est stage manager on Broadway,'' Ms. Mitchell was also known to be able to out-curse the coarsest of stagehands.         Her dedication and care for detail quickly became legendary on Broadway. She kept, for example, a complete list of the best doctors in every major city on the East Coast in case actors got sick on the road, as well as a list of popular bars and restaurants.         On the opening night of ''She Loves Me'' in 1963, the curtain got stuck while rising during the overture. Ms. Mitchell, who was sitting in the audience in formal wear, climbed onstage to unhitch the curtain. She did, and the show, as they say, went on.         She is survived by her companion, Florence Klotz, and a sister, Juliette Fleischer, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.       
         Marie Windsor, who played sassy femmes fatales, cynical bawdyhouse matrons and two-timing crooks in 74 movies with enough verve to win the informal accolade ''Queen of the B's,'' died on Sunday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80.         Acting opposite male stars like Marlon Brando, George Raft, James Garner and John Wayne, she portrayed a succession of strong, but seldom admirable characters: she was the blunt, beautiful dame with the bedroom eyes who was rotten to the core and didn't care who knew it.         ''I know you like a book, ya little tramp,'' Sterling Hayden said to her in the 1956 film ''The Killing,'' directed by Stanley Kubrick.''You'd sell out your own mother for a piece of fudge.''         In ''The Narrow Margin'' (1952), she played a sexy gangster's widow who ends up riding across the country by rail with a police escort played by Charles McGraw. ''She's a dish,'' he tells his partner, ''a 60-cent special: cheap, flashy, strictly poison under the gravy.''         Later, he tells her, ''You make me sick to my stomach.''         ''Yeah?'' she snarls. ''Well, use your own sink.''         She also made guest appearances on more than 100 television shows, including ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Her film career spanned five decades, and included film noir classics like ''Force of Evil'' (1948) and westerns like ''The Fighting Kentuckian'' (1949), with Mr. Wayne. But she also had no qualms about appearing in quickie efforts like ''Cat Women of the Moon'' (1954), ''Swamp Women'' (1955) and ''Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' (1955). ''I think those films added to my luster,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. ''I think people said, 'She can even do that and survive.' ''         She came to take pride in the title Queen of the B's. As she said in several different interviews over the years, ''It's better to be queen of something than nothing at all.''         Emily Marie Bertelsen was born on Dec. 11, 1919, in Marysvale, Utah, a small farming community where her father was a mechanic. Her grandmother took her to see films with Clara Bow, the ''It Girl,'' as a child. By the time she was 11, her parents drove 30 miles over dirt roads to take her to acting lessons.         After she won two local beauty pageants and studied drama for two years at Brigham Young University, her parents drove her to Hollywood to study with Maria Ouspenskaya, the famed acting instructor. She stayed at the Hollywood Studio Club,  whose residents included Marilyn Monroe and Donna Reed. She worked as a cigarette girl at the Mocambo, a Sunset Strip nightclub.         In 1941 she made her movie debut in Paramount's ''All-American Coed,'' wearing a costume of velvet carrots. After appearing in some bit parts, she headed for New York, where she was cast in more than 400 radio shows, including a nine-month stint on the soap opera ''Our Gal Sunday,'' from 1943 to 1945. During her last year in New York, she played the femme heavy in the Broadway play ''Follow the Girls.''         MGM then signed her to a contract, though she did lesser roles for many other studios, including some very small ones, through the 1950's.         ''A lot of things hampered my career,'' she said in an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle in 1994. ''At 5 foot 9, I was too tall for most leading men. And I never had a classic face. One of my casting directors at Paramount said about me, before I'd even started my career, 'Her eyes are too big and she has a bad mouth.' ''         The Chronicle quoted Frances Bergen, the mother of Candice and a long-time friend, as suggesting that Ms. Windsor's striking resemblance to Joan Crawford might have obscured her during Crawford's heyday. But Ms. Windsor found a niche in film noir, a genre of mainly crime thrillers that captured a sense of postwar disillusionment. In ''Force of Evil,'' she played Roy Roberts's sultry, promiscuous wife in a tale about the numbers racket. For the first time, she received featured billing and was pictured in the advertising. She once said in an interview: ''I didn't know I was doing film noir, I thought they were detective stories with low lighting! Even Kubrick, in  'The Killing,' never used the term film noir to my knowledge.''         Perhaps her best remembered role was in the low-budget ''The Narrow Margin,'' in which she played a sexy gangster's wife with a heart of gravel. That role spurred Kubrick to cast her as an unfaithful wife in ''The Killing,'' for which she won the best supporting actress award from Look.         ''One of the reasons film noir is so popular today is that it left so much to the imagination, in contrast to today when everything is so explicit,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times last year. ''Film noir engaged the audience, let them use the gray matter between their ears.''         Ms. Windsor is survived by her husband, Jack Rodney Hupp; her son, Richard Hupp; a brother, Jerry Bertelsen; and a sister, Louise Atherley.         She was a director of the Screen Actors Guild for 25 years, and was aligned with the union's conservative wing, represented by Ronald Reagan and Charlton Heston. But many conservative movie viewers might be hard pressed to believe it. Her characters were just so radically evil.         She told Classic Images, a film magazine: ''Fans would send me Bibles with specific verses underscored and accompanied by handwritten warnings that 'the devil would get me and I'd go to hell,' if I didn't reform.''       
         Libertad Lamarque Bouza, a singer and actress whose career ranged from the gritty days of early tango recordings in Argentina to the contemporary daily soap operas produced for mass audiences in the Spanish-speaking world, died on Dec. 12 in Mexico City. She was 92.         Ms. Lamarque gained renown after leaving Argentina for Mexico in 1946, following an incident on the Buenos Aires set of the 1944 movie ''The Circus Procession.'' She was said to have quarreled with a young actress named Eva Duarte.         The next year Duarte married Col. Juan Domingo Peron, and in 1946, Peron became president of Argentina. Exercising her power as first lady, Eva Duarte Peron effectively prevented any studio in Argentina from hiring Ms. Lamarque.         After she moved to Mexico City in the 1940's, during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, Ms. Lamarque's career blossomed. She acted in the first film that the Spanish director Luis Bunuel made in Mexico, ''The Great Casino,'' and appeared in some 60 other films.         ''Strangely, even with a strong Argentine accent that never quite went away, she became the darling of Mexican cinema,'' said Carl Mora, an expert on Latin American film at the University of New Mexico. ''Her magnetic presence made for quite a life trajectory.''         It was in Rosario, the provincial Argentine city where Ms. Lamarque was born, that she began her artistic career. Her father was Gaudencio Lamarque, a Uruguayan descendant of French immigrants and a militant anarchist. Because he was imprisoned at the time of her birth, his daughter was named Libertad, or Liberty. Together with six half-brothers and -sisters, she began acting as a child in plays inspired by anarchist ideas.         In 1926, when Ms. Lamarque turned 18, her family moved to Buenos Aires. She soon found work singing in comedy shows. Then a music studio hired her to record tango songs, and she began to attract attention. Ms. Lamarque also started acting, making her debut in the 1929 silent film ''Adios, Argentina,'' which was made by the Italian director Mario Parpagnoli in a single day. In 1932 she starred in ''Tango,'' Argentina's first sound film.         Ms. Lamarque's first marriage, to Emilio Romero, who worked as a prompter in the theater, turned sour shortly after they exchanged vows in 1928. Still, because divorce was illegal at the time in Argentina, it took Ms. Lamarque 12 years to become legally separated from him.         In 1935 she was reported to have attempted suicide while on tour in Chile. That same year her husband took their daughter, Mirtha, with him to live in neighboring Uruguay. After an effort involving a lawyer and several friends, including Hector Artola, her new romantic partner and future husband, Ms. Lamarque succeeded in gaining custody of her daughter.         While in Argentina, Ms. Lamarque acted in more than 20 movies, including ''Honeysuckle,'' ''When I Return to Your Side'' and ''In This Gray Afternoon.'' But it was in Mexico that she took her place as a leading figure in Latin American cinema, and later in the melodramatic world of daily telenovelas, or soap operas. In later years she divided her time between Mexico City and Miami, but refused to retire.         Earlier this year the Mexican Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences awarded her a lifetime achievement award. At the time of her death she was playing a Mother Superior in ''Angelface,'' a popular telenovela.         Ms. Lamarque is survived by her daughter, Mirtha Romero Lamarque, of Argentina.
