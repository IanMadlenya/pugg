         Jean Camper Cahn, a lawyer who helped establish Federal financing of legal services to the poor and was a co-founder of the now-defunct Antioch School of Law in Washington, died on Wednesday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 55 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband and law associate, Edgar S. Cahn.         Mrs. Cahn spent most of her career pursuing legal and social causes in Washington, where the Cahns lived for two decades until they moved to Florida in 1984.         In one of her latest cases, argued in a Federal District Court in Florida, a decision handed down a week before her death upheld her contention that money distributed under the Older Americans Act must be aimed at benefiting those in greatest need. A Family of Activists         Mrs. Cahn was born into a family of social activists. Her father, Dr. John E. T. Camper, a physician in Baltimore, was a founder of the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in that city, where she was born and reared.Regular visitors to the home included Thurgood Marshall, who was to become the first black Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and the singer Paul Robeson, who was her godfather.         While at Swarthmore College she met Mr. Cahn, a fellow student whose ancestors had been rabbis and lawyers for seven generations. The couple married in 1957 when she graduated and he was in graduate study of English at Yale.         Mrs. Cahn converted to Judaism and, at her husband's urging, applied for and won a scholarship to Yale Law School. Their elder son, Jonathan, was born on the day of her first examinations at law school, and their younger son, Reuben, was born a year later, while they were living and studying at Cambridge in England on a Fulbright fellowship.         Returning to New Haven, Mrs. Cahn served as associate general counsel for the New Haven Redevelopment Agency and in the country's first neighborhood legal services program, the Dixwell offices of Community Progress Inc., financed by the Ford Foundation. Joined War on Poverty         In 1964, during their final year in New Haven, the Cahns jointly wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal proposing a national system of legal services to the poor as part of what was to become the Johnson Administration's War on Poverty.         They moved to Washington that year, he to enter private law practice and she to take a post in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Mrs. Cahn was the first director of the National Legal Services Program in the O.E.O. and later founded the Urban Law Institute at George Washington University.         Mrs. Cahn attracted national notice in 1967 and 1968 as a lawyer for Adam Clayton Powell, a popular Harlem Congressman who was battling in court to reverse his 1967 expulsion from the House of Representatives for misuse of public funds and other transgressions. (The Congressman sat out the 90th Congress and subsequently won a special election and joined the 91st Congress in 1969. His expulsion was later found illegal by the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Powell died in 1972.)         In 1971 the Cahns co-founded the Antioch School of Law, which placed emphasis on serving the poor and trained prospective lawyers in social activism. Eight years later, Antioch College in Ohio, with which the school was initially affiliated, dismissed the Cahns as co-deans. The law school eventually became autonomous and, largely because of severe financial problems, it closed in 1988.         Mrs. Cahn continued to teach and to practice law. In 1984 she was a distinguished visiting professor at Middlebury College in Vermont, and in 1986 she was a distinguished visiting scholar at the London School of Economics. From 1986 until her death she was counsel to the Miami law firm of Fernandez-Caubi, Fernandez, Cancio & Allen.         In addition to Mr. Cahn, she is survived by their sons, Jonathan, a member of the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, and Reuben, a public defender in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; her mother, Florine Camper of Baltimore; two brothers, Nixon and John Camper, and three sisters, Elizabeth Jones, Mary Lou Redd and Ella Johns, all of Baltimore.       
         The Rev. Marilyn Adams Moore, an executive with the United Church of Christ, died Jan. 3 at her home in Dayton, N.J. She was 57 years old.         She died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Ms. Moore had served as secretary for racial and social justice with the Board for Homeland Ministries of the United Church of Christ since 1988. She worked on programs to help the clergy and laity respond to social issues and initiated programs to help immigrant women and the homeless.         Before that, she was assistant minister of St. Alban's Congregational Church in Queens.         A graduate of New York Theological Seminary, Ms. Moore was ordained in 1982. She also held positions with the National Council of Churches and the Interreligious Foundation for Community Organization. She was a member of the Central Jersey Chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         She is survived by two daughters, Sharon-Frances and Meredith, both of Dayton; and two brothers, Edward B. Adams of Austin, Tex., and Dr. Clarence Lancelot Adams of Manhattan.       
         Dr. Leona Baumgartner Langmuir, a public health official who was New York City's Commissioner of Health from 1954 to 1962 and later was an assistant administrator of the Agency for International Development, died on Tuesday in Chilmark, Mass. She was 88 years old and lived Chilmark.         She died of polycythemia, a blood ailment, said her husband, Dr. Alexander D. Langmuir.         Dr. Baumgartner, as she was known during her career, joined the Department of Health in 1937 and rose to become its first female commissioner. Characteristically, she shrugged off the distinction, as she did again in 1962 when President John F. Kennedy appointed her to head the Office of Technical Cooperation and Research at A.I.D., making her the highest-ranking woman in the United States Government at the time.         In 1966 Dr. Baumgartner was named visiting professor of social medicine at the Harvard Medical School, a post she held until she retired in 1972. Family Planning Advocate         In her career at the Health Department, Dr. Baumgartner was a strong proponent of improving public-health education and of modernizing government programs, particularly in family planning and in maternal and children's health.         In the national and international health arena, while serving with the Agency for International Development, she established a Research Advisory Council to improve standards of professional quality in grants for health and welfare programs around the globe. She was credited with persuading President Lyndon B. Johnson to reverse a policy that had prevented the agency from including birth control in its support of health programs in underdeveloped countries.         Dr. Baumgartner was born in Chicago and raised in Lawrence, Kan., where her father taught zoology at the University of Kansas. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the university and was a Rockefeller Research Fellow at the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute in Munich before winning a Sterling Fellowship to study at Yale, where she took a Ph.D. in immunology and went on to receive an M.D. from the Yale Medical School.         After internship and residency at New York Hospital she spent a year with the United States Public Health Service before joining the New York City Health Department, where she started as an instructor and served as director of the Bureau of Child Hygiene on her way to the department's top position. Safeguarding Public Health         She left for 18 months in the late 1940's to become associate chief of the United States Children's Bureau, returning to the Health Department in 1950 as assistant commissioner. In 1953 she left again to become executive director of the nonprofit New York Foundation but returned a year later when Mayor Robert F. Wagner promised her a free hand as commissioner.         A woman of seemingly boundless energy, Dr. Baumgartner raced about the city on inspection tours and spoke out on sanitary failures of restaurant kitchens, day nurseries and anywhere else she felt the public health could be safeguarded. For several years she gave a health-education message to a nationwide television audience on a morning program hosted by Arlene Francis.         In contrast to most large cities, as many as 35 percent of the babies born in New York were seen in the city's well-baby and immunization clinics under her direction. Her management of emergency maternity and infant-care clinics for dependents of military personnel in World War II was recognized as innovative.         After the war she undertook a thorough revision of the city's sanitary code and expanded a public health laboratory that had already won acclaim in the field. In 1958 she established a Public Health Research Institute in New York with an annual budget of more than $7 million from municipal money to perform basic and applied research on a wide range of health problems.         Dr. Baumgartner was an early advocate of the Salk vaccine to immunize the public against polio, and one of her last achievements as health commissioner was to win a political battle to fluoridate the city's water supply to prevent tooth decay.         Among the honors Dr. Baumgartner received were the Sedgwick Medal and the Lasker Award of the American Public Health Association and the Public Welfare Award of the National Academy of Sciences.         Dr. Baumgartner's first husband, Nathaniel M. Elias, a chemical engineeer, died in 1964. In 1970 she married Dr. Langmuir, an epidemiologist, who survives.       
         Allison Moore Coudert, a philanthropist who was active in civic causes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of pneumonia, said her daughter, Allison P. Coudert of Tempe, Ariz.         Mrs. Coudert was a member of the A.S.P.C.A.'s Founder's Society and supported museums and social welfare organizations in New York. She was past secretary of the Child Adoption Service of the Children's Aid Society and had been treasurer of the Oyster Bay Visiting Nurse Association on Long Island for many years. She attended Vassar College and served on the board of the Women's City Club.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Alexis, of McLean, Va.; a sister, Nina Moore Galston of Huntington, L.I.; a granddaughter, and a great-grandson.       
         LuEsther T. Mertz, a general partner in Publishers Clearing House who was known for her extensive philanthropy on behalf of the arts and other causes, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 85 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.         She had had several strokes in recent weeks, said her lawyer, William B. O'Connor.         Mrs. Mertz became a general partner in Publishers Clearing House, the magazine-subscription business, soon after its founding in 1953 by her husband, Harold E. Mertz, and their daughter, Joyce Mertz Gilmore. She and her husband were later divorced.         She was the chairman of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival from 1973 to 1987 and underwrote moving several of its productions from the Public Theater to Broadway, including "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "A Chorus Line."         Recalling her support for the arts and her interest in social justice, Mr. Papp said that despite her wealth, "there was nothing in her that suggested anyone was different from anyone else." He described her as high-spirited but said she "never wanted to be in the spotlight."         Mrs. Mertz, a longtime supporter of dance, was on the board of the Original Ballets Foundation, which operates the Feld Ballets/NY and the New Ballet School. She also supported the New York City Ballet. The Joyce Theater on Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, which opened in 1982 and is devoted to dance, is named in memory of her daughter, who died of cancer in 1974. Literature on Tape         In 1961 she founded Choice Magazine Listening in Port Washington for people who are unable to read regular print. The organization selects articles, fiction and poetry from contemporary periodicals, records them on cassette tapes and distributes the tapes free. To endow the organization, she set up a private foundation, the Lucerna Fund.         The LuEsther T. Mertz Retinal Research Center at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital is named for Mrs. Mertz.         She was a major contributor to many New York City cultural and educational institutions, including Lincoln Center and the New York Botanical Garden, and received the Mayor's Award for Arts and Culture in 1983 and the New York State Governor's Arts Award in 1986.         In recent years, she was chairman of the Joyce Mertz Gilmore Foundation, which supports nonprofit activities in human rights, world security and the environment and New York City cultural and civic programs.         She was a trustee of the Port Washington Public Library and a founding member of the Port Washington League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Mertz, whose maiden name was Turner, was born in Cincinnati and grew up in Williamsport, Pa. She graduated from Syracuse University in 1927 with a degree in library science.         Her son, Peter, died in an accident in 1954. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Katie Louchheim, a former State Department official and a former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was a prominent figure in the social life of Washington for four decades, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Louchheim, who had been in failing health for the last few years, died of pneumonia, her family said.         Although she never held elective office, her influence in politics was considerable, beginning in 1934 when she arrived in Washington with her husband, Walter, a Manhattan investment counselor. He had been called on to help organize the Securities and Exchange Commission in the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.         Mrs. Louchheim was also a poet, and the Louchheims' house in Georgetown soon became a meeting place for people in politics and the arts. A vivacious woman of enormous energy, she plunged into Democratic Party affairs and worked her way up to become vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 1956 to 1960. Posts in United Nations         Along the way, she held various appointed government posts. In World War II she served in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation and helped form its United Nations counterpart, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, for which she went to Europe in 1945 to arrange press relations at camps for displaced people.         President John F. Kennedy gave her a post in the State Department, and within two years she was named Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, at that time the highest job in the department ever held by a woman.         She moved to other State Department posts through the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson and was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization until 1969, when the Republicans took power under President Richard M. Nixon. Rejected Republican Roots         Mrs. Louchheim was born in Manhattan in 1903. Named Kathleen Scofield, she was known for most of her life as Katie. The daughter of a Manhattan stockbroker, she grew up in Republican surroundings; when she moved to Washington in Roosevelt's first term she was a prime example of what people called "a traitor to one's class."         She attended Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Conn., and studied in Europe before marrying Mr. Louchheim in 1926.         She published a collection of poems, "With or Without Roses," in 1966. Her autobiography, "By the Political Sea," came out in 1970. She wrote "The Making of the New Deal -- The Insiders Speak," published by Harvard University Press in 1983.         After her husband died in 1973, Mrs. Louchheim moved back to Manhattan. In 1981 she married Donald S. Klopfer, a co-founder of the publishing concern Random House; he died in 1986.         She is survived by two daughters, Mary Evangelista of Manhattan and Judith Read of Darien, Conn.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Ruth Landes, an anthropologist who won critical acclaim for her studies of black Brazilians, Indians in North Dakota and Hispanic-Americans in the American Southwest, died on Feb. 11 at her home in Hamilton, Ontario. She was 82 years old.         Dr. Landes's best-known book was "The City of Women," published in 1947 by Macmillan, in which she reported on life around the Brazilian seaport of Bahia, in which women played the dominant roles in a society of descendants of African slaves.         Dr. Landes was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Joseph Schlossberg, a co-founder of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers of America. While attending New York University, where she earned a bachelor's degree, she began a four-year anthropological study of black Jews and of followers of Marcus Garvey's Back-to-Africa movement.         She received a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work and a doctorate from Columbia, under whose auspices she did research among North Dakota's Ojibwa Indians. Her nine published works include studies of other Indian tribes and a treatise on bilingualism and biculturalism in Spain, Switzerland, South Africa, Canada and the United States.         Since 1965 Dr. Landes had taught at McMaster University in Hamilton.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Virginia Mae Brown, who as chairman of the Interstate Commerce Commission became the first woman to head an independent administrative agency of the Federal Government, died Sunday at her home in Charleston, W. Va. She was 67 years old.         The cause of death was a heart attack, said her daughter, Pamela Kay Brown.         Mrs. Brown, a lawyer, served as an I.C.C. commissioner from 1964 to 1979, was vice chairman of the commission in 1968 and was named chairman for a one-year term in 1969.

Barron of West Virginia, she became the state's first female insurance commissioner. And in 1962 she became the first female member of the West Virginia Public Service Commission. An Administrative Law Judge         After leaving the I.C.C. in 1979, Mrs. Brown returned to West Virginia, where she was an administrative law judge for the Federal Department of Labor in Charleston and later for the Social Security Administration there.         Mrs. Brown, whose maiden name was the same as her married name, was born in Pliny, W. Va., and graduated from the University of West Virginia in 1945. She then enrolled at the university's law school, one of two female students there at the time, and graduated in 1947.         After receiving her law degree in 1947, she served as law clerk to Ira J. Partlow, then the West Virginia Attorney General.         Her marriage to James V.

         Cora DuBois, an anthropologist, teacher and author who was an authority on Southeast Asia, died Sunday at a nursing home in Brookline, Mass. She was 87 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         She died of pneumonia and heart failure, her secretary, Eric Davis, said.         Dr. DuBois was the Zimurray Professor of Anthropology at Harvard University and Radcliffe College when she retired in 1969. In World War II, she served with the Office of Strategic Services. She was later with the State Department, the Institute of International Education and the Far Eastern Association.         In 1938 Dr. DuBois, who had taught anthropology at Hunter College, went to live in Alor, a small island in the Dutch East Indies. Living alone in a house in a remote mountain village, she learned the local language and was able to win the confidence of villagers by giving simple medical aid. Study of Islanders         The result of her 18-month inquiry was "The People of Alor," a social and psychological study published in 1944 that won acclaim for its thoroughness and lucidity. She also wrote "Social Forces in Southeast Asia," which appeared in 1949, and her writings were widely published in scholarly journals.         Dr. DuBois was a graduate of Barnard College, where she worked under the anthropologists Franz Boas and Ruth Benedict. She received her doctorate from the University of California at Berkeley after extensive ethnographic studies of Indian tribes in the American Northwest.

         Joan Colebrook, a writer, died on Saturday at Cape Cod Hospital in Hyannis, Mass. She was 80 years old and lived in Truro, Mass.         She died after a heart attack, her son Jay Colebrook said.         Mrs. Colebrook wrote two novels in the 1940's, one about pre-World War II life in England, the other, "The Northerner" (1948), about life in Australia, where she grew up.         She received most praise for her nonfiction books. In "The Cross of Lassitude: Portraits of Five Delinquents" (1967), she used her experiences as a social worker and officer in women's prisons to track five teen-age girls through the penal system. She also wrote for Commentary, The New Yorker and other magazines.

         Nettie S. Horch, an arts patron and co-founder of the Master Institute of United Arts in New York City, died at the Humana-Biscayne Hospital in North Miami on Monday. She was 94 years old and lived in Hallandale, Fla.         She died of bronchitis, her daughter, Oriole Farb Feshbach, said.         The Master Institute, which began as a music school with a collection of Old Master art works, was founded by Mrs. Horch in 1922 with her husband, Louis. Its purpose was to help bring people together through the arts.         In 1928 the Horches incorporated quarters for the Institute in a 29-story residential skyscraper they built at Riverside Drive and 103d Street. Their aim was to provide an environment of art and culture for apartment dwellers, and they developed the concept that income from the apartments would support the art activities of the Institute. The building contained a 300-seat theater, a non-profit school of fine arts, studio apartments for musicians and dancers, and the Riverside Museum, a small, vanguard institution that became known for showing work that differed from the prevailing currents in the art world.  Equality in Acquisitions         Mrs. Horch became the director of the museum, which not only housed the couple's collection of Tibetan, American, and American Indian art, but mounted many early shows by artists who were later to become well-known, like Louise Nevelson. The museumdevoted a number of shows to the work of women, and under Mrs. Horch's direction, presented in 1939 the first exhibition by the Abstract American Artists, whose work ran against the social realist trend of the time. The museum also gave shows to the Federation of Modern Painters and Sculptors and the National Association of Women Artists. In 1940 it mounted one of the earliest exhibitions of work by Puerto Rican artists.         As fine arts chairman of the National Council of Women of the United States, from 1937 to 1954, Mrs. Horch was interested in fostering the work of women artists, and mounted a series of group shows devoted to women of various nationalities, among them Japanese, Canadian and Norwegian.         In 1971, after Mrs. Horch and her husband moved to Florida, the museum was closed, and its holdings became the Louis and Nettie Horch Collection at Brandeis University. Mr. Horch died in 1979.         Besides her daughter, who lives in Leonia, N.J. and Amherst, Mass., Mrs. Horch is survived by a brother, Nathan Stone of Lake Worth, Fla., four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Isabel Cary Lundberg, an educator and sociologist, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, a family spokeswoman said.

She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Jed Wheeler.         Ms. Jernigan was known for witty, vivid collagist work that was as much social commentary as art.

         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died last night at her home in South Salem, N.Y., The Associated Press reported. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Dewhurst was pronounced dead by her personal physician, said Jan Stutts, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office. The cause of death was not immediately available.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten." She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses.         Her most recent New York appearances were on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in "Ah, Wilderness!," and as O'Neill's wife, Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1987. Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until last May.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant to use her distinctive, big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings." Born in Canada         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee Downer College, a girls' school, and decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side, shortly before he moved to Central Park. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice. Start of a Team         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming young performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two children, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Her first Broadway role with lines came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero. Starring With Jason Robards         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Ms. Dewhurst's other Broadway credits include the 1983 revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's comedy "You Can't Take It With You," in which she co-starred with Mr. Robards; O'Neill's "More Stately Mansions," with Ingrid Bergman in 1967; Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson McCullers's "Ballad of the Sad Cafe," in 1963, and a revival of Mr. Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," with Ben Gazzara and directed by Mr. Albee, for which she was nominated for a Tony in 1977.         She also appeared in many productions for Mr. Papp's Shakespeare Festival, including an "Antony and Cleopatra" in Central Park in 1963 without Mr. Scott (Michael Higgins played Antony) and stagings of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth." Her other Off Broadway plays include Athol Fugard's "Hello and Goodbye," in which she co-starred with Martin Sheen in 1969 and won a Drama Desk Award.         Her many films include Woody Allen's "Annie Hall"; "The Cowboys" and "McQ" with John Wayne; "Tribute" with Jack Lemmon; "The Nun's Story"; "A Fine Madness," and "Ice Castles."         She performed in the recent movie "Dying Young" with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!" Numerous TV Roles         On television she was seen with Candice Bergen on "Murphy Brown" in the last three seasons as Murphy's mother, Avery Brown, winning an Emmy Award in 1989. Her other television credits include productions of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," two Arthur Miller plays, "The Price" and "The Crucible," "No Exit," "The Women's Room," "As Is," "Anne of Green Gables," "Anne of Avonlea" and "Lantern Hill." She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about the most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to Campbell Scott, she is survived by another son, Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer, and two grandchildren.

         Aline (Honi) Pollitzer Weiss, active for more than half a century with organizations concerned with the welfare of children, died on Sunday at her summer home in Stephentown, N.Y. She was 95 years old and lived in Medford, N.J.         She died in her sleep, her son-in-law, Judge Louis Pollak of Philadelphia, said.         For many years, Mrs. Weiss was chairwoman of the board of the Wiltwyck School for Boys. She was also on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development, Louise Wise Services and the Encampment for Citizenship, a youth leadership development group.         She came from a family with a tradition of social involvement. Her mother, Alice Kohn Pollitzer, one of nine women in Barnard College's first graduating class, founded the Encampment for Citizenship. Her sister, Margaret Pollitzer Hoben, helped found the Walden School.         When she was 70, Mrs. Weiss and her mother, on principle, challenged a Federal Government provision that required Medicare applicants to sign a loyalty oath. In 1967, while their challenge moved through the court system, the Justice Department conceded that the oath was unconstitutional.         Mrs. Weiss's husband, Louis, died in 1950. She is survived by two daughters, Elizbeth W. Goldwasser of Urbana, Ill., and Katherine W. Pollak of Philadelphia; a son, Dr. William P. Weiss of Chester, Vt., 18 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         E. Tamu Bess, a former special assistant to Basil Patterson when he was deputy mayor of New York City and New York State Secretary of State, died Aug. 1 in Midway Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 39 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Bess died in surgery after being shot in an attempted robbery in front of the home of a colleague, the Los Angeles police said.         Before Ms. Bess moved to Los Angeles last year, she had worked in politics, philanthropy, social service and the arts in New York City.         In politics, in addition to her work with Mr. Patterson, she helped organize the New York City Black Political Convention in 1982. She had been executive director of the Twenty-First Century Foundation, established to finance eceonomic development in black communities, and was a board member of the Black United Fund. She also helped restructure the summer camp and after-school programs of Minisink Town House, a Harlem settlement house that she attended as a child.         Ms. Bess had worked to produce the 10th anniversary program of the Black Filmmaker Foundation and was talent coordinator for "Spike & Company: Do It A Cappella," broadcast last year by PBS.         In Los Angeles, she worked in film publicity.         In the 1970's she took the name Tamu, which means sweetness in Swahili, and used the initial of her given first name, Evna.         She is survived by her mother, Dorothy T. Ellington Ashley of Washington, and her brother, David Ellington of Los Angeles.       
         Laura Riding Jackson, a poet, critic and co-founder with Robert Graves of various literary publishing ventures, died on Monday at the Humana Sebastian Hospital in Sebastian, Fla. She was 90 years old and had lived in Florida since 1938.         She died of cardiac arrest, said Theodore Wilentz, a close friend.         Born in New York City and originally named Laura Reichenthal, Miss Riding established herself as an important avant-garde poet in the early 1920's, when she attracted the attention of the Fugitives, a group of American Southern writers centered at Vanderbilt University. Members of the group included John Crowe Ransom, Allen Tate and Robert Penn Warren.         In 1923, their magazine, The Fugitive, commended Miss Riding's first published poem for its originality, and in 1923 hailed her work as "the discovery of the year."         In praising her poetry, the critic Paul Auster wrote that "in poem after poem, we witness her trying somehow to peel back the skin of the world in order to find some absolute and unassailable place of permanence."         Later, Miss Riding joined the English poet and novelist Robert Graves, with whom she lived during the 1920's and 30's, as co-founder of a small literary publishing firm called Sezin Press, which lasted from 1927 to 1938. She and Mr. Graves also edited Epilogue, a series of volumes of criticism that contributed to a school of thought that became known as The New Criticism.         In 1938, she married Schulyer B. Jackson, the critic and former poetry editor of Time magazine, and settled in Florida. She renounced poetry at that time, "as imposing irremovable obstacles to the realizing of the full potential afforded by language."         Both because of her devotion to language and defiance of all social instituitions, the critic Martin Green once wrote, Ms. Riding became "a hero for all poets and other rebels."       
         Nell Donnelly Reed, a pioneer in women's ready-to-wear clothing in the 1920's and 1930's, died Sunday morning at her home in Kansas City, Mo. She was 102 years old.         In 1916, Mrs. Reed began making and selling ruffled dresses to replace the drab, cotton house dresses of the period. By the 1940's her clothing company was described as the largest of its kind in the world.         Mrs. Reed said her frilly designs under the Nelly Don label helped challenge conventional thinking of pre-World War I America that it was impossible to give style to clothing in the cheap price range. Her first dresses sold for $1, considerably more than the average price of 69 cents. Savvy in Business         Mrs. Reed was described by Fortune Magazine in 1935 as possibly the most successful businesswoman in the United States. She was considered one who was ahead of her time, being among the first business leaders in her city to offer paid group hospitalization for employees and an unlimited number of tuition-paid night courses and scholarships for their children at local colleges, according to The Kansas City Star.         Through her business, the Donnelly Garment Company, a $3.5 million business with 1,000 employees in 1935, she helped turn Kansas City into a thriving ready-to-wear manufacturing center. Her first husband, Paul Donnelly, a representative for a Kansas City shoe company, acted as the head of the garment company in its early days, but she assumed full control when they were divorced in 1932.         In 1931 Mrs. Reed was the subject of national headlines when she and her chauffeur were kidnapped at gunpoint outside her home and held for ransom. The $75,000 ransom went unpaid and the two were released unharmed 32 hours later. Two men received life terms for their part in the abduction.         The prosecutor in the kidnapping case was James A. Reed, a former United States Senator and former Mayor of Kansas City, whom she would later marry. Mr. Reed, who served three terms in the United States Senate, from 1911 to 1929, died in 1944.  Company Name Changed         The 12th of 13 children, Mrs. Reed was born Ellen Quinlan on March 6, 1889, and grew up in Parsons, Kan., where her family had moved from County Cork, Ireland. At age 16, she married Mr. Donnelly and moved with him to Kansas City.         She said she began adding frills to house dresses so she could "make women look pretty when they are washing dishes," she once said.         The rapid growth of her company in the 1930's brought efforts by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to organize her plant, but despite legal maneuvers that reached the United States Supreme Court, her company was still union free in 1948.         Mrs. Reed retired from her company in 1956 and it changed its name to Nelly Don Inc. The company went public in 1958, but eventually filed for bankruptcy.         After her retirement, Mrs. Reed continued her involvement in business and civic affairs in Kansas City, serving on the school board and boards of numerous social and cultural institutions, including the Kansas City Art Institute and the Midwest Research Institute.         She is survived by a son, David, and four grandchildren.

         Olga Spessivtzeva, a Russian ballerina whose dancing was praised for its Romantic purity and spiritual radiance, died on Monday at Nyack (N.Y.) Hospital. She was 96 years old and lived at the Tolstoy Foundation Nursing Home in Valley Cottage, N.Y.         She died of pneumonia, said Elizabeth Lopukhin, a social worker at the nursing home.         Miss Spessivtzeva was acclaimed by critics in the 1920's and 30's as one of this century's most eloquent interpreters of "Giselle." In later years, her life was often compared to that of the ballet's tragic heroine. Just as Giselle, a frail, melancholy young woman, succumbs to madness in the ballet, so Miss Spessivtzeva had a series of mental breakdowns that ended her career.         At the height of her performing powers, she was said to have been magical onstage. Anton Dolin, a former partner who became her biographer, once declared: "The quality of beauty she produced caused the heart to miss a beat. She had a calm, glowing integrity, a serenely devotional approach to her work."         Miss Spessivtzeva was born in Rostov, Russia, and was trained at the Imperial Ballet School of St. Petersburg. After her graduation in 1913, she joined the Maryinsky (now the Kirov) Ballet and, despite a bout with tuberculosis, continued to dance during the 1920's in western Europe with Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. Diaghilev had long admired the ballerina Anna Pavlova, but he said, "My astonishment was then unbounded when I met Spessivtzeva, a creature finer and even purer than Pavlova." As choreographer for the Diaghilev company, George Balanchine created the title role of "La Chatte" for Miss Spessiv tzeva in 1927. Last Performance in 1937         The ballerina, who occasionally shortened her name to Spessiva, also appeared with the Paris Opera Ballet, the Colon ballet in Buenos Aires and the Camargo Society, a London organization that was one of the forerunners of the Royal Ballet.         While touring the world in the mid-1930's with the Victor Dandre-Alexander Levitov Ballet, the successor to Pavlova's company, Miss Spessivtzeva began to suffer from increasingly serious breakdowns. She gave her last performance in 1937 and settled in New York the next year. She was hospitalized from 1943 to 1963, when, with the aid of several friends, including Mr. Dolin, she was able to move to the Tolstoy Foundation.         There she led a quiet life. Her health improved, and members of the dance world occasionally visited her. Gerald Arpino, who choreographed a tribute to her, "L'Air d'Esprit," for the Joffrey Ballet in 1978, recalled in an interview: "She had this fragile, unworldly quality. She seemed to transcend time."         There are no immediate survivors. A memorial service is to be held at 11 A.M. tomorrow at St. Sergius Chapel in Valley Cottage.       
         Margaret Ramsay, a theatrical agent who was a leading figure in the British theater, died on Wednesday in the London Clinic. She was 83 years old.         She died of heart and circulatory problems, her assistant, Mary Carter, said.         Miss Ramsay, known to many as Peggy, built a formidable client list in the decades she worked as an agent, representing among others the playwrights Robert Bolt, Eugene Ionesco, Alan Ayckbourn, Vaclav Havel, Christopher Hampton, Larry Kramer, Edward Bond, Caryl Churchill and David Hare. One of her best-known clients was the playwright Joe Orton; in the 1987 Stephen Frears film about Orton's life, "Prick Up Your Ears," Miss Ramsay was played by Vanessa Redgrave.         Miss Ramsay was born Margaret Venniker on May 28, 1908, in a small town near Sydney, Australia. She was raised in South Africa, where her father had inherited an ostrich farm. Around 1930, she married Norman Ramsay, a professor of psychology, and with him moved to England; shortly afterward, their marriage ended.         She entered the theater first as a singer, then as an actress, and spent some time working in theater production and management before opening her agency early in the 1950's.         Soon she was representing many of the avant-garde playwrights whose works were regularly presented at the Royal Court Theater in the 50's and 60's. It was Miss Ramsay who introduced the Romanian-born Mr. Ionesco to the English stage.         Miss Ramsay was widely admired for her devotion to good writing and social commitment, and one of her favorite admonitions to a new writer was, "Don't extract the teeth from anything, dear."         Her longtime companion, the actor William Roderick, died in April. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Belinda Mason, a member of the National Commission on AIDS who pleaded with President Bush in a letter in August not to support proposed Federal policies that she said would further stigmatize AIDS sufferers, died this morning at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville. She was 33 years old.         She died of AIDS-related pneumonia, a spokesman for the commission said.         Ms. Mason was infected with the virus that causes AIDS when she received a blood transfusion in 1987 while giving birth to her second child. Hospital workers had not tested the blood she received, but later found that it was contaminated with the AIDS virus.         Before she became infected, Ms. Mason worked as a reporter for two weekly newspapers, The Ohio County Times-News in Hartford, Ky., and later for The Appalachian News-Express in Pikeville, Ky. She also wrote short stories.         When she learned she was infected with AIDS, she became an advocate for better medical and social treatment of people with the AIDS virus. Ms. Mason founded Kentuckiana People With AIDS Coalition, the first Kentucky-based advocacy organization for those stricken with AIDS. 'An AIDS Poster Child'         She later became president of the National Association of People With AIDS and was appointed by President Bush to the National Commission on AIDS in 1990.         "I have become the disease," she said in an interview six weeks ago. "When people talk to me now, they see the disease first. Nobody talks to Belinda Mason the short-story writer anymore. My previous identity has dissolved. I've become an AIDS poster child."         In her letter to Mr. Bush on Aug. 2 she said she had no ill will toward health-care workers even though she contracted the disease through their lapses. She also said she opposed widespread compulsory testing of such workers. Nor, she wrote, did she want people with AIDS to be barred from entering the United States. Both proposals are being considered in Washington.         "Mr. President, doctors don't give people AIDS -- they care for people with it," she wrote. "The blanket screening of health-care workers will create the false illusion that people with AIDS are a threat to others."         Ms. Mason is survived by her husband, Stephen Carden, and their two children, Polly, 8, and Clayton, 4. She will be buried on their Kentucky farm.       
         Grace Zaring Stone, a novelist who also wrote under the pen name Ethel Vance, died on Sunday at the Mary Elizabeth Nursing Center in Mystic, Conn. She was 100 years old and had lived in Stonington, Conn.         Three of Mrs. Stone's novels were made into films: "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," in 1933, which starred Barbara Stanwyck and Nils Asther; "Escape" (1940,) with Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor and Conrad Veidt, and "Winter Meeting" (1948,) with Bette Davis.         "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," about a New England woman who arrives in China to marry a missionary but becomes a captive of a Chinese warlord, was the first movie to be shown at Radio City Music Hall.         "Escape," an anti-Nazi thriller, was written in 1939 under the pseudonym Ethel Vance. In 1942 the author said the pen name had been used to protect her daughter, Eleanor Perenyi, who was living in occupied Europe, and because Mrs. Stone's husband, Ellis, was the United States naval attache in Paris, where they were living.         The book became a best seller, and Mrs. Stone used the Vance name for some of her later books, including "Reprisal" (1942) and "Winter Meeting," (1946).         Mrs. Stone was the great-great-granddaughter of Robert Owen, the British social reformer and socialist who founded the cooperative colony of New Harmony in Indiana. Her mother died when she was born, and she spent most of her childhood "visiting around," she said.         "In all the houses of the Owen descendants there were many books being very thoroughly read and almost everyone kept diaries," she said. "Diary keeping, writing in general, was just something one did. Then I married into the Navy and of course that was very, very different. But when my husband was stationed at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, the place seemed to get me started."         She wrote an account of a hurricane, and the Atlantic Monthly bought it, and later bought a short story as well. Then "Bobbs-Merrill wrote to ask me if I had a novel in mind, by any chance," Mrs. Stone said, "and of course that was a most amazing question to me, because I'd had a novel in mind practically forever."         Mrs. Stone's first novel was "The Heaven and Earth of Dona Elena," published in 1929. Her other works included "The Cold Journey" (1934,) "The Secret Thread" (1949) and "Althea" (1962).         Surviving besides her daughter, a writer, of Stonington, are a grandson and a great-graddaughter.       
         Alice R. Bachrach, a volunteer leader of numerous national social service agencies who was involved in a landmark discrimination suit, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Mrs. Bachrach died of cancer, her family said.         Among her early activities, she organized and was chairwoman of the Women's Division of the National Jewish Welfare Board and was a vice president of the board for 19 years. She was a board member of the United Service Organizations during World War II and the Korean war.         She also had been an honorary governor of Hebrew Union College, vice president of the New York City Y.W.H.A., vice president of the national Girl Scouts and chairwoman of its American Girl magazine, executive committee member of the New York Blood Center and a trustee of the Parsons School of Design.         Mrs. Bachrach, whose maiden name was Rothschild, was born and grew up in Manhattan and studied at Parsons. She married Alfred R. Bachrach, a prominent accounting executive and president of Temple Emanu-El, the world's largest Reform Jewish congregation. Mr. Bachrach has since died.         In a landmark case 30 years ago, Mr. and Mrs. Bachrach filed a religious-discrimination complaint against a Park Avenue cooperative for rejecting their application to buy an apartment. The city Human Rights Commission upheld their complaint and moved for injunctive relief, the first time the agency exercised that remedy against a cooperative.         Mrs. Bachrach is survived by her twin sons, John, of Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and Robert, of Manhattan and Southbury, Conn., and a daughter, Ellin Gordon, of Williamsburg, Va.       
         Margaret L. A. MacVicar, dean of undergraduate education at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and an innovator in shaping policies for undergraduate education and science education in public schools, died Monday at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. She was 47 years old and lived in Cambridge, Mass., and Lebanon, Me.         She had been ill with cancer for a year, an M.I.T. spokesman said.         Professor MacVicar believed in educating students about their social responsibilities. "It is not technicians that we seek to prepare, nor bench-tied engineers practicing narrow specialities," she said. "Our purpose is to direct the best minds toward inquiries and enterprises concerned with the human condition." Work for Diversity         After becoming undergraduate dean in 1985, she worked for diversity in the admission of women, members of minorities and students with varied interests. She also implemented changes in humanities and science requirements.         Professor MacVicar, a professor of physical science, had held the endowed chair as Cecil and Ida Green Professor of Education since 1980.         As dean, Professor MacVicar's responsibilities included oversight of M.I.T.'s Reserve Officer Training Corps program. Last year, she criticized a Department of Defense policy barring homosexuals from R.O.T.C. programs, saying that such policies "run counter to the values of inclusion and equality which are the foundation of this institution." The faculty voted to have M.I.T. work with other schools for a reversal of the policy. Recipient of Irwin Sizer Award         Margaret MacVicar was born in Hamilton, Ontario, and moved with her family to Flint, Mich., as a child. She received her B.S., in 1964, and her doctorate, in 1967, from M.I.T. For two years, she was a postdoctoral fellow at Cambridge University in England.         In 1973, she was the first recipient of the M.I.T. Class of 1922 Career Development Award to support young faculty members of exceptional promise and unusual devotion to teaching. In 1977, she received the Irwin Sizer Award for the most significant contribution to education at M.I.T., and in 1979, she held the Chancellor's Distinguished Chair at the University of California, Berkeley, in the Department of Materials Science and Engineering. In 1985, she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree from Clarkson University.         Survivors include her parents, George and Elizabeth MacVicar of DeBary, Fla., and two sisters, Anne Amato of Brookline, N.H., and Victoria MacVicar of Pepperell, Mass.       
         Nadine Gordimer, whose novels of South Africa portray the conflicts and contradictions of a racist society, was named winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature today as her country finally begins to dismantle the system her works have poignantly explored for more than 40 years.         In a brief citation, the Swedish Academy, which confers the awards, referred to her as "Nadine Gordimer, who through her magnificent epic writing has -- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- been of very great benefit to humanity."         The academy also added that "her continual involvement on behalf of literature and free speech in a police state where censorship and persecution of books and people exist have made her 'the doyenne of South African letters.' " Effects of Apartheid         In her stories and in such novels as "A Guest of Honour," "Burger's Daughter" and "My Son's Story," Miss Gordimer has written of the effects of apartheid on the relationships of men and women, parents and children.         The academy had reportedly passed over the 67-year-old Miss Gordimer several times. "I had been a possible candidate for so long that I had given up hope," she said today in New York City, where she was on a lecture tour to promote her new collection, "Jump and Other Stories."         She is the first woman to win the literature prize in 25 years, and one of only seven to win it in its 90-year history.         This year's Nobel awards, the rest of which will be announced here and in Oslo later this month, carry a stipend of about $985,000 each, the largest amount ever. Nobel's will established a sizable fund -- from his earnings as a chemical engineer and inventor of, among other things, dynamite -- for the winners: "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."         Prof. Sture Allen, one of the 18 members of the academy elected for life and also its permanent secretary, said that he had tried to call Miss Gordimer in Johannesburg on Wednesday night to give her the good news, but nobody at her home knew how to reach her.         The Swedish Academy, in a brief critique of her works issued with its citation, said today: "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment. At the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings."         In South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk extended his congratulations to Miss Gordimer for what he called "this exceptional achievement which is also an honor to South Africa." He stopped short of endorsing her uncompromising writing.         "As South African head of state, I am always pleased when one of my countrymen does well and achieves international recognition," Mr. de Klerk said in a deliberately neutral statement. "The Nobel Prize for literature is unequaled in prestige in the world. Winning it is a noteworthy achievement from any point of view."         The award to Miss Gordimer led the television news broadcast of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which devoted 80 seconds to her achievement, informing viewers that the same honor had been bestowed upon Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Pearl S. Buck.         Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, said he was "over the moon" about the award to Miss Gordimer: "She's an outstanding artist, has a way with words but more than anything else she has had this tremendous commitment and caring about people, caring about justice."         Miss Gordimer was born in 1923 in a small mining town near Johannesburg.  Both her parents were immigrant Jews -- her father from Lithuania, her mother from England. As a young writer, she has said, she was strongly influenced by "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel of social protest in America, which started her thinking about the plight of the miners in her own country.         Her first short story was published when she was only 15, and her first collection in 1949. Many stories appeared later in "The Soft Voice of the Serpent," a collection published in 1952; other notable groupings were "Friday's Footprints" in 1960, "Livingstone's Companions" in 1971, and "Something Out There," in 1984.  Ambiguity of a Title         The decisive part of her work, for the Swedish Academy, was her novels, particularly "July's People," published in 1981. The book describes a white family fleeing civil war with the help of their black servant, July, who takes them to his village. "The ambiguity of the novel's title quickly etches itself -- July's people are the white family he still serves but also the members of his tribe," the academy's literary critique said.         The announcement of the award to Miss Gordimer -- made at precisely 1 P.M., in keeping with tradition -- was met with cheers. Not since 1966, when Nelly Sachs shared the award with Shmuel Yosef Agnon of Israel, has a woman won the literature prize.         Professor Allen said the disagreements within the academy that had prevented the prize from going to Miss Gordimer before this would remain a secret for 50 years, like most other details of the prize committee's deliberations. But he volunteered that he had long been an admirer of her work.         He insisted that the award had nothing to do with the politics of apartheid, or with the fact that it was only this year that South Africa's leaders had finally begun to dismantle the system.         "The Nobel Peace Prize is a political award," Professor Allen said, "and it will be announced in Oslo. This is a literary award. That is her own argument; she is very keen on that point. Her works have a political basis, but her writing is different." Will Help Black Writers         Miss Gordimer, who is a member of the African National Congress, which had long been outlawed, said today that she wanted to use some of the prize money to help the predominantly black Congress of South African Writers.  "I'm a founder of the Congress of South African writers," she said at a news conference in New York, "and all my colleagues are black. Most of the black authors write in English, and I hope that they will begin to express themselves in their African languages."         The South African Government banned "A World of Strangers," published in 1958 and describing the difficulties experienced by a Briton establishing friendships with black South Africans in segregated Johannesburg. More than 20 years later, it banned "Burger's Daughter," a novel described by the academy today as one of her masterpieces, along with "The Conservationist" and "July's People."         "A Guest of Honor," published in 1970 and another novel cited by the academy today, described the conflict of loyalties experienced by a former colonial administrator returning to a newly independent African country that had expelled him for his ties to black groups.         "My Son's Story," published in 1990, describes "love in an insupportable society, the complications and obstacles inherent in the path to change," the academy said.         "The novel is ingenious and revealing, and at the same time enthralling because of its poetic values," the academy said. "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her outstanding literary style characterize her short stories as well."         All of her 10 novels and 9 short-story collections are now permitted to be published in South Africa.         Despite her fight against apartheid, Miss Gordimer, who has been married since 1954 to a Johannesburg gallery owner, Reinhold Cassirer, has always considered herself a South African. She said that she had only once considered emigrating, to Zambia. "Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European, a stranger," she told Reuters in an interview this year.         The Nobel awards for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. He established the first five categories in his will; economics was added in 1968, with an endowment from the Bank of Sweden.       
         Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht, an author of 18 books of history and biography who frequently espoused liberal social and political causes, died yesterday of congestive heart failure, her husband said. She was 59 years old.         Mrs. Feuerlicht was born in 1931 in New York City. She earned a bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1952, and after working as an editor of The Glen Oaks News and This Month magazine, began writing books. She published biographies of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Gandhi, Marie Curie, Theodore Roosevelt and Martin Luther King.         Among her most discussed works was her 1972 study, "McCarthy and McCarthyism," which argued that the late Wisconsin Senator was "an enemy of America's basic institutions" who "came closer to destroying America than any Communist, foreign or domestic."         Writing for The New York Times Book Review, Fred J. Cook described "McCarthy and McCarthyism" as "excellent, solidly researched."         Mrs. Feuerlicht's 1977 book on the trial and executions of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti was praised in The New York Times by John Leonard as "the most comprehensive and persuasive account of the case we have," although he faulted the author for her tendency to "pontificate."         She is survived by her husband, Herbert Alan Feuerlicht of Manhattan, and a son, Ira, of Brooklyn.       
         Doris Lilly, the author of "How to Marry a Millionaire" and a former newspaper society columnist, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Kurt von Schuschnigg, a friend and the executor of her estate.         Ms. Lilly was a witty participant in the social whirl of charity balls and nightclubs she featured in her books and as a gossip columnist for The New York Post, the McNaught Syndicate and WPIX television in New York. An Inspiration to Capote         "If it were true that money grew on trees, all my friends would be married to apes," she said. She once conceded that her columns were sometimes "silly" and that the people she wrote about were sometimes "shallow." But, she said, "they're pleasant and they smell good and they eat well and drink good wines, and that's all right."         Friends said she was the inspiration for the Holly Golightly character in Truman Capote's book "Breakfast at Tiffany's."         Her own first book, "How to Marry a Millionaire" (Putnam, 1951), became a hit movie starring Marilyn Monroe. Later, doing the updated "How to Marry a Billionaire" (Delacorte, 1984), she said: "A million dollars isn't much money these days. You can't even get a decent house for that."         Ms. Lilly's often provocatively titled books included "How to Make Love in Five Languages" (Bobbs-Merrill, 1965), "Glamor Girl" (Woodhill, 1977, with Robin Moore as co-author) and "Those Fabulous Greeks: Onassis, Niarchos and Livanos (Cowles, 1970). 'Never Fond of Poverty'         "She was never fond of poverty," wrote Cindy Adams, the New York Post columnist. Remarking on Ms. Lilly's skills in meeting rich people, Ms. Adams wrote that "when the rest of us were in camel's hair," Ms. Lilly received a prized sable coat from a male admirer "who was a little bit married."         Ms. Lilly herself never married anyone, millionaire or otherwise. But she did socialize with the famous and powerful. Even in her youth as a contract actress for Cecil B. DeMille, she had an eye for up and coming people. She dated Ronald Reagan when he was between marriages to Jane Wyman and Nancy Davis.         Three years ago, two letters that Mr. Reagan sent Ms. Lilly were auctioned at Sotheby's to Malcolm Forbes, the publisher, for $4,400. She said that "these letters were written during the period we saw each other, which went on for three years."         Ms. Lilly, who was born in South Pasadena, Calif., attended public schools in Santa Monica. She had a continuing magazine career, working variously as beauty editor of Town and Country and a contributor to McCall's, Ladies' Home Journal, Cosmopolitan and, at the time of her death, Avenue.         She was a columnist for The Post from 1968 to 1978, and a commentator for WPIX from 1974 to 1977. She was also a frequent guest on the Merv Griffin Show and television panel shows.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Marion Letcher Bohmrich, a research analyst with the Office of Strategic Services and with the United States Mission to the United Nations, died on Thursday at Fair Haven Home in Bostic, N.C., where she was a resident. She was 89 years old.         She died of pneumonia and suffered from Alzheimer's disease for 10 years, a spokesperson for the home said. She had requested that her remains be made available for research at the Alzheimer's Research Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C.         Mrs. Bohmrich, a daughter of a Foreign Service officer, traveled and studied in Western Europe, focusing on German culture and tradition. In 1941, she was recruited by the O.S.S., forerunner of the Central Intelligence Agency, as a social science analyst.         After World War II, she was transferred to the Department of State and sent to the Mission to the United Nations, where she worked with Eleanor Roosevelt when she was chairwoman of the Commission on Human Rights from 1946 to 1951.         A native of Turin, Ga., she attended a number of schools in Europe, Mexico and the United States, including Columbia University.         Her first marriage to John Moore McKeehan Woodburn, a writer and editor, ended in divorce. She later married Louis Bohmrich, a Foreign Service officer and lecturer on foreign affairs, who died in 1981.         She is survived by a stepson, Roger Bohmrich of White Plains, and a sister, Adele Letcher Goddard of Sun City, Ariz.       
         Leah Silberzan Sayles, a leader in the movement to legalize abortion in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan.         She was 61 years old and died of a brain tumor, her family said.         Ms. Sayles joined the board of directors of the Abortion Justice Association in 1969, was a founding member of the National Abortion Federation and was active in the National Abortion Rights Action League.         Soon after earning a master's degree in social work from the University of Pittsburgh in 1968, she became the counseling director for Planned Parenthood in Western Pennsylvania, based in Pittsburgh. In 1973 she established Women's Health Services in Pittsburgh and served as its executive director for 11 years. The agency at one time described itself as the nation's largest nonprofit abortion clinic.         She is survived by her husband, Donald; two sons, David, of Manhattan and Adam, of Kenova, W. Va., and a sister, Frances Edlitz of Rockville, Md.       
         Simone Yellen Feldman, an interior designer, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         She died of leukemia, said Victoria Hagan, her partner in Feldman-Hagan Interiors, a New York design firm.         Mrs. Feldman was born in New York and obtained a B.F.A. from Syracuse University. She established her own design firm in the late 1950's and became a member of the American Society of Interior Designers in 1975. Ms. Hagan met Mrs. Feldman through a mentor-apprenticeship program sponsored by the A.S.I.D. when she was a student at the Parsons School of Design in 1982. Mrs. Feldman founded Feldman-Hagan Interiors with Ms. Hagan in 1985 to specialize in residential interiors and corporate office work.  Uncluttered, Not Minimal         In the last few years, Feldman-Hagan Interiors has risen to prominence and garnered a following among stylish clients who favored a look that is uncluttered but not minimal. Spare, often neutral-colored rooms, were furnished with an eclectic mix of antiques and modern pieces, as well as graphic modern photographs.         Feldman-Hagan Interiors participated in the 1988 showhouse at Keewaydin, a home in Southampton, L.I., that benefited the Rogers Memorial Library there, and in the prestigious 1990 Kips Bay Boys' and Girls' Club Decorator Showhouse. The decorators devised a "salon of social consciousness," an airy living room that was considered the most influential room in the showhouse.  Recycling a Theme         Combining such objects as an antique toy airplane with a Louis XVI settee and including some handwritten words from Antoine de Saint-Exupery's "The Little Prince," the room wove the concepts of recycling and responsibility to nature into an elegant framework.         Mrs. Feldman's corporate clients have included U.S. Steel, the Harmonie Club and, most recently, Mitsui Fudosan, a Japanese real-estate company.         Mrs. Feldman is survived by her husband, Edgar; a brother, Sherman Yellen; a daughter, Mindy Schanback, and a grandson, Benjamin, all of Manhattan.       
         Minna Citron, a painter and printmaker best known for her Social Realist images of New York City, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a long illness, said her granddaughter Christiane Citron of Denver.         Mrs. Citron, whose maiden name was Wright, was born in Newark on Oct. 15, 1896, and grew up in Brooklyn. She began to study art as a diversion in the 1920's when she was living in Brooklyn, married and the mother of two sons. By 1928, she was studying at the Art Students League with John Sloan and Kenneth Hayes Miller, whose satirical depictions of city life influenced her own style. She had her first solo exhibition in 1930 at the New School for Social Research.         By 1934, she was divorced and working in a studio on Union Square. She soon became associated with a loosely knit group of Realist painters known as the 14th Street school, who included Moses and Raphael Soyer and Isabel Bishop. In the late 1930's she taught art and painted murals for the Works Progress Administration. In the early 1940's, she changed to abstraction, which remained her primary style for the rest of her life.         Mrs. Citron had many exhibitions, both in the United States and abroad; her most recent show in New York City was held last year at the Susan Teller Gallery in SoHo. Her work is represented in many museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, and the National Museum of American Art and the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.         She is survived by her sons, Casper, of Manhattan a radio and television commentator, and Tom, of Short Hills., N.J.; seven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Lydia Ulana Savoyka, a Ukrainian-born social worker, who served 35 years as director of immigration counseling services for the United States Catholic Conference, died on Dec. 20 at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of a heart attack after collapsing in her office, her sister, Vera Savoyka, said.         Ms. Savoyka, whose father was arrested and killed by Russian forces in Cracow, Poland, came to the United States in 1948, under a program for orphans, sponsored by the National Catholic Welfare Conference. As soon as she graduated from high school, Ms. Savoyka began working with immigrants on Ellis Island under the auspices of the Welfare Conference, now known as the U.S. Catholic Conference.         Fluent in 11 languages, she proved invaluable in dealing with the wave of post-World War II immigrants from Eastern Europe and the later influx of refugees from Central America. While carrying a heavy work load, she earned a degree in sociology by going to night school at Hunter College. 'Extraordinary Devotion'         Besides her counseling activities, Ms. Savoyka was president of the New York General Committee for Immigration, grouping 30 private agencies, and was a member of the National Advisory Council on Immigration and Naturalization. She was also vice president of the Ukrainian Institute of America and president of the Self-Reliance Senior Citizens Club.         In conferring on her an honorary doctorate in law in 1982, the College of New Rochelle cited her "life of extraordinary devotion to America's newest arrivals." In the last few years she had personally helped hundreds of victims of the Chernobyl nuclear diaster of April 1986, arranging medical and immigration services.         She is survived by her sister.       
         Berenice Abbott, a pioneer of modern American photography, died yesterday at her home in Monson, Me. She was 93 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said Hank O'Neal, her biographer.         Miss Abbott is best known for her powerful black-and-white photographs of New York City in the 1930's. In these pictures, she used the tools of modernist photographic style -- including dynamically framed compositions, flattened pictorial space, high angles, and great detail -- to capture the enormous energy and variety of the city.         Perhaps her most famous picture, a view of New York at night taken from the top of the Empire State Building, presents the city as a glittering tapestry of light, with massive buildings thrusting up from the criss-crossed streets. In her New York photographs, many of which were collected in the book "Changing New York" (1939), Miss Abbott also provided an invaluable historical record of the physical appearance of the city at a time when it was undergoing rapid transformation.         Miss Abbott first achieved fame as a photographer in Paris in the 1920's with her penetrating portraits of such artists and writers as James Joyce, Janet Flanner and Jean Cocteau. She is also known for a series of photographs illustrating laws and processes of physics. Documentary Advocate         As a participant in the photographic controversies of her day, Miss Abbott was an eloquent and contentious advocate of the documentary approach. In books and articles she argued that photography was uniquely a descriptive medium, and should not be used to simulate effects that could better be achieved in other arts. "Photography can never grow up if it imitates some other medium," she wrote in 1951. "It has to walk alone; it has to be itself."         Miss Abbott was also known as the person primarily responsible for the present-day fame of the French photographer Eugene Atget, whom she met in Paris two years before his death in 1927. For almost four decades Atget had earned a modest living photographing the artistic monuments of Paris and its environs, selling prints to artists, publishers and archivists. In the course of this work he had built up a large file of photographs documenting Parisian life and culture.         Upon his death Miss Abbott bought the almost 1,500 glass-plate negatives and some 8,000 prints remaining in his studio. When she returned to New York in 1929, she brought the materials with her, and in following years arranged exhibitions, print sales and the publication of several books of Atget's work.  The collection remained in Miss Abbott's possession until 1968, when it was acquired by the Museum of Modern Art; it later became the basis for a series of four exhibitions and books that was completed in 1984. Assistant to Man Ray         Atget's photographs, which combine straightforward description with great formal beauty, have exerted a great influence on the development of American photography. Most notably they served as a model for the work of Walker Evans, who first saw them in New York shortly after Miss Abbott's return from Paris. In the years since, Atget has provided an important example of purpose and style to a host of other photographers.         Born in Springfield, Ohio, on July 17, 1898, Berenice Abbott studied briefly at Ohio State University before going first to New York and then, in 1921, to Europe to study sculpture and drawing. She went into photography by accident, going to work in Paris in 1923 as a darkroom assistant for the American Surrealist Man Ray. In 1925 she took up portrait photography as a means of earning a living, but quickly discovered her love and aptitude for the work. In 1926 she opened her own studio, and soon built up a successful career as a portrait photographer.         On a short visit to the United States in 1929 she was excited by the speed and energy of New York, and decided to undertake a project to record the changing face of the city. She moved back to the United States and began to photograph, working first with a small, hand-held camera. By 1932, though, she had switched to a large-format camera that produced 8-by-10-inch negatives capable of recording great detail. 'Changing New York'         For several years she financed the project herself. In 1935, though, she was able to obtain support from the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration and began to produce the pictures that were published four years later as "Changing New York." She focused on architectural details and important historical buildings, as well as bridges and skyscrapers, often aiming her camera up or down to achieve dizzying perspectives. Occasionally she included people in the pictures, but her primary emphasis was on the physical structure of the city. Her pictures of row houses and tenements, elevated trains and automats, warehouses and store fronts, provide a remarkably thorough record of the city in all its diversity.         After completing her documentation of New York, Miss Abbott turned to scientific photography and invention, and in 1958 she joined the physical science study committee of Education Services Inc., in Cambridge, Mass., to take photographs for a new high-school physics text. Many of her pictures from this time have a remarkable geometric beauty while at the same time providing clear illustrations of such physical phenomena as the interference patterns produced by two sets of waves or the refraction of a beam of light through a prism.         Her scientific photographs won her new acclaim both before and after the textbook "Health" was published in 1960. In the opinion of her principal biographer, Mr. O'Neal, her scientific work "may well be viewed in future years as her outstanding contribution to photography." A Major Retrospective         During her years in New York, Miss Abbott was an active freelance photographer. She established the photography program at the New School for Social Research, and published several other books. In 1966 she moved to Maine, where she lived until her death, although she retained a connection to the city through a continuing association with the New York Public Library, which sponsored a major retrospective exhibition of her work in 1989.         The New York exhibition, organized by Julia van Haaften, later traveled to Dallas, Atlanta, Toledo, Ohio, and Tokyo. Over the years Miss Abbott's work was the subject of many other exhibitions at major museums, including the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History and Technology in Washington (1969) and the Museum of Modern Art in New York (1970). In 1982 her life and work were summed up in a book, "Berenice Abbott: American Photographer," by Mr. O'Neal.         There are no survivors. A spokesman for the New York Public Library said a memorial service would be held in the library's Celeste Bartos Forum at a date to be announced.         Correction:  December 20, 1991, Friday         An obituary on Dec. 11 about the photographer Berenice Abbott misstated the title of the 1960 textbook in which photographs by Miss Abbott appeared. It was "Physics."
