She was 99 years old.         Helen Steele Reece, founder and director of the Reece School, a private elementary school for children with emotional and learning disabilities, died in her sleep on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.         She founded the school in 1948 in a brownstone at 180 East 93d Street, using small classes with more teachers than usual to create a supportive setting. The school was also a training center for teachers in the field.         Mrs. Reece, a native of Hillsboro, Ohio, graduated from the Teachers College of Columbia University. She began as a teacher at the City & Country School in Manhattan, later becoming director of Rosemary Hall, a private school in Greenwich, Conn. She was a former director of the Downtown Community School in Manhattan.         There are no immediate survivors.         Correction:  January 17, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Thursday about the founder of the Reece School in Manhattan, a private school for children with emotional and learning disabilities, misidentified her. She was Ellen Steele Reece.

Hasebroock, former president of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, died Sunday at Bryan Memorial Hospital, Lincoln, Neb., after a brief illness. She was 83 years old and lived in Lincoln.         Mrs. Hasebroock served as president of the organization, which has members in 41 countries, including 500,000 in the United States, from 1964 to 1966.         In the late 1960's she received South Korea's highest citizen award, the Public Welfare Medal, for the federation's support for Shin-ai Village, a 50-home settlement for Korean War widows and their children. The federation had provided the aid at Mrs. Hasebroock's behest.         She is survived by a son, Robert of Lincoln; three grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
        Carolyn Haywood, a popular author and illustrator of children's books who is best known for her ''Betsy'' and ''Eddie'' series for 7-to-10-year-olds, died of a stroke yesterday at her home in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia. She was 92 years old.         Carolyn Haywood, a popular author and illustrator of children's books who is best known for her ''Betsy'' and ''Eddie'' series for 7-to-10-year-olds, died of a stroke yesterday at her home in the Chestnut Hill section of Philadelphia. She was 92 years old.         Miss Haywood's writing career began in 1939 with '' 'B' is for Betsy,'' published by Harcourt Brace. After eight books with that company, she moved to William Morrow & Company, where she published 39 more books, most recently, ''Hello, Star'' in 1987. Her last manuscript, ''Eddie's Friend, Boddles,'' was delivered to Morrow just before Christmas and is to be published next year.         Her picture books and novels used humor in dealing with day-to-day school and family matters. ''There are no great problems solved here, nor great adventures,'' a New York Times reviewer, Phyllis Fenner, wrote about ''Snowbound With Betsy'' (1962). ''Yet Carolyn Haywood makes the everyday doings of children exciting and funny, entering into them from a child's level. That is sheer genius and can't be done by calculation.''         Miss Haywood, who was known early on for her portraits of children, illustrated her own books until the 1970's, using as models children who lived in her neighborhood.         She was born in Philadelphia and studied to be a teacher before turning to art and to writing. She taught for a year in the Friends Central School in Philadelphia, then attended the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts, where she studied portrait painting and won a scholarship for European travel.         She also studied privately. Miss Haywood did several mural decorations for Philadelphia banks and a public school, and did hand lettering and illumination as well as children's portraiture.         There are no immediate survivors.

Izard, a retired children's librarian in Westchester County, died of complications from cancer on Monday at her home in Gwynedd, Pa. She was 74 years old.         Miss Izard was a consultant for the Westchester Library System, which has more than 40 branches, for nearly 20 years. She led classes, workshops and monthly meetings for librarians in book reviewing, storytelling and book collections.         She headed the children's services division of the American Library Association and was former chairwoman of its Newbery-Caldecott committee.         She began her career at the New York Public Library and also worked in Greenwich, Conn., and Mount Vernon, N.Y., before going to Westchester in 1959. Miss Izard retired in 1976. The Board of Regents gave her the James E. Allen Jr. Memorial Award for distinguished service to education.         She graduated from Duke University in 1937 and received an M.A. from Simmons College in 1940.         There are no immediate survivors.

        Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Barbara Stanwyck, the luminous protagonist of such classic movies as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''The Lady Eve'' and ''Double Indemnity'' and the award-winning western television series ''The Big Valley'' in the 1960's, died of congestive heart failure yesterday in a hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 82 years old.         Miss Stanwyck's press agent, Larry Kleno, said she died shortly before 5 P.M. at St. John's Hospital and Health Center, where she had been admitted about a week ago.         The actress played a rich mix of characterizations in 82 films but developed a distinctive image as a gutsy, self-reliant and self-assured woman whose husky voice and cool exterior usually masked a warm heart.         She was a tough-talking but tender-souled mother in ''Stella Dallas'' (1937), a slang-slinging showgirl in ''Ball of Fire'' (1941), a lurid blonde who orchestrates her husband's murder in ''Double Indemnity'' (1944) and a bedridden neurotic who learns from telephone quirks that she is marked for murder in ''Sorry, Wrong Number'' (1948).         Miss Stanwyck was nominated for best-actress Academy Awards for all four of those performances but won none. However, in 1982 the Motion Picture Academy awarded her an honorary Oscar for being ''an artist of impeccable grace and beauty, a dedicated actress and one of the great ladies of Hollywood.'' A year earlier, she became the eighth person, and second woman, to be honored by the Film Society of Lincoln Center for career-long excellence.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).         Some of Her Other Films         Other memorable Stanwyck films were ''The Bitter Tea of General Yen,'' which opened Radio City Music Hall in 1933, ''Annie Oakley'' (1935), ''Banjo on My Knee'' (1936), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Union Pacific'' (1939), ''Golden Boy'' (1939), ''Remember the Night'' (1940), ''The Great Man's Lady'' (1942), ''Lady of Burlesque'' (1943), ''Clash by Night'' (1952) and ''Titanic'' (1953).         The actress commanded increasingly higher salaries in the 1930's and early '40's, and in 1944 the Government listed her as the nation's highest-paid woman, earning $400,000.         From the mid-1950's on, she lent distinction to a string of otherwise lackluster movies. Turning to televison, she made many guest appearances and then starred in an anthology series, ''The Barbara Stanwyck Show,'' in 1960-61, and the highly popular series ''The Big Valley,'' in which she portrayed a frontier rancher from 1965 to 1969. The two series won her two Emmies and a cluster of other awards.         The actress's take-charge, down-to-earth screen image mirrored her childhood as Ruby Stevens, born into a poor family of Scottish-Irish descent in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn on July 16, 1907.         When she was 4 years old, her mother was killed when a drunken stranger pushed her off a moving streetcar. The loss devasted her father, a bricklayer, who deserted his five children. They never saw him again.         Left School at Age 13         Young Ruby, who had to board with family friends, sought solace by seeing as many movies as her pennies allowed. At the age of 13, she had to leave school to earn a living. She started as a wrapper in a department store and worked in other low-paying clerical jobs while studying dancing with a vaudevillian friend of her family.         At 15, Ruby entered show business as a chorus girl, first dancing in speakeasies and soon advancing to Broadway and touring stints in the Ziegfeld Follies and other revues. At 18, she won a leading role as a cabaret dancer in a melodrama, ''The Noose,'' which ran on Broadway for nine months. The program introduced her as Barbara Stanwyck, a glamorous name inspired by a theatrical poster: ''Jane Stanwyck in 'Barbara Frietchie.' ''         In 1927, at the age of 20, she won a leading role in the Broadway play ''Burlesque.'' She received good notices, played the part for two years and won nonexclusive contracts with Columbia Pictures and Warner Brothers.         Her first important movie role was classic Stanwyck - a shallow adventuress redeemed by love in a 1930 melodrama, ''Ladies of Leisure,'' directed by a youthful Frank Capra.         'Beloved by All' Involved         Mr. Capra, who also directed her in four later movies, wrote in his 1971 autobography, ''The Name Above the Title,'' that she was unique in not requiring rehearsals because she ''gave her all the first time she tried a scene.'' Her dedication, he wrote, made her ''beloved by all directors, actors, crews and extras.''         Miss Stanwyck was also the favorite of Cecil B. De Mille, who wrote, ''I have never worked with an actress who was more cooperative, less temperamental and a better workman, to use my term of highest compliment.'' '' She was also the favorite leading lady of William Holden, Henry Fonda and Robert Preston.         Friends and colleagues described the actress as modest, generous and outspoken, and co-workers fondly called her ''Missy.'' If a cameraman she worked with decades earlier was having financial problems, she invariably gave him enough money to ease his troubles. She repeatedly refused to use a double and was seriously injured several times.         Miss Stanwyck's hair began silvering in her mid-40's, but she refused to dye it, just as she refused to conceal her age. In a 1981 interview at her longtime Beverly Hills home, she offered this advice:         ''You have to know when you've had your hour, your place in the sun. To be old is death here. I think it's kind of silly. Be glad you're healthy. Be glad you can get out of bed on your own.''         Even in her 70's Miss Stanwyck began every day by walking half a mile on an uphill treadmill that dominated her bedroom.         Praise for 'Thorn Birds'         In the early 1970's the actress became semi-reclusive. But in 1983 she appeared in a television mini-series, ''The Thorn Birds.'' Of her performance as a wealthy Australian who lusts after a young priest, John J. O'Connor of The New York Times concluded, ''When it comes to the big moments, she demonstrates the kind of disarming toughness that made her a major movie star.''         Miss Stanwyck was married twice, to the comedian Frank Fay from 1928 to 1935, and to the actor Robert Taylor from 1939 to 1951. With Mr. Fay, she adopted a son, Dion Anthony Fay. In 1981 she said of her second divorce:         ''Losing somebody you love by death or divorce is hard. But if they decide they want to be free, there's nothing to battle for. You have to let go. Bob and I didn't stay friends. We became friends again. Time does take care of things.''         In 1965, Miss Stanwyck and Mr. Taylor co-starred in her last movie, ''The Night Walker.'' Four years later, he died of lung cancer.

And, in 1987, her colleagues and admirers added their tributes to her independent spirit and professionalism as she received the 15th annual life achievement award of the American Film Institute.         Her outstanding roles included a card-sharp and pseudo-British socialite who dupes a naive scientist (Henry Fonda) in ''The Lady Eve'' (1941), a manipulative reporter redeemed by an idealist (Gary Cooper) in ''Meet John Doe'' (1941), a millionaire haunted by a childhood murder in ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers'' (1946) and a shrewd stockholder in ''Executive Suite'' (1954).

        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''       
        Antonetta Ferraro, the mother of Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former Representative and Vice-Presidential candidate, died of emphysema and heart disease on Friday at the home of her daughter in Forest Hills, Queens. She was 84 years old.         Antonetta Ferraro, the mother of Geraldine A. Ferraro, the former Representative and Vice-Presidential candidate, died of emphysema and heart disease on Friday at the home of her daughter in Forest Hills, Queens. She was 84 years old.         Mrs. Ferraro, who lived in Forest Hills near her daughter's home, was hospitalized in December but left to stay with her daughter's family for the Christmas holidays and remained there until her death.         She was born in Manhattan and attended public school until she was 12 years old, when she went to work as a crochet beader in a Lower East Side factory. She married Dominick Ferraro, who was born in Italy, and they operated a family restaurant and a five-and-ten-cent store.         Widowed in 1944, she went back to work in the garment industry to support her children. Her daughter recalled yesterday that her mother's earnings put her and her brother, Carl, through high school and college. The daughter, who is married to John A. Zaccaro, has said she kept her maiden name in honor of her mother's struggle to educate her children.         In addition to Geraldine and Carl Ferraro, Antonetta Ferraro is survived by six grandchildren.       
        Daphne Barritt-Vane Arnstein, an arts patron who founded the Harlem Cultural Council and was a co-founder of the Jazzmobile, died of heart disease Saturday in Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Daphne Barritt-Vane Arnstein, an arts patron who founded the Harlem Cultural Council and was a co-founder of the Jazzmobile, died of heart disease Saturday in Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Arnstein and the pianist and composer Billy Taylor founded the Jazzmobile 25 years ago to bring summer programs of free live music performed by prominent musicians to various New York neighborhoods. She served on the board of Jazzmobile, which also conducts year-round workshops, lectures and demonstrations. For her role in Jazzmobile's creation, Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller presented Mrs. Arnstein with the New York State Council on the Arts Award.         Mrs. Arnstein also founded Bands of Steel, a music training program; Festival on the River, and Speakeasy, a dialogue between grade school children and the elderly. She served on the jazz council of Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians and took part in the breakfast feeding program of St. Peter's Lutheran Church.         Mrs. Arnstein, a native of Tonbridge, England, came to the United States in 1941. She worked for Russian War Relief, became director of the Westchester Chapter of the National Conference of Christians and Jews and president of the Utopia Day Care Center in Harlem.         Surviving are two sons, Simon, of Baltimore, and Nelson B., of Santa Monica, Calif.; a daughter, Gemma Rettman of Eugene, Ore., and two grandchildren.

She was 87 years old and had lived in Leonia, N.J., for 60 years.         Mrs. O'Neill, working for the Health Department, was a pioneer in ''well baby'' treatment, in which pediatricians monitor the development of healthy children. She later became director of the World Federation of Mental Health.         She was born in Kansas City, Mo., and received bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology from the University of Minnesota. At the Cleveland Child Guidance Institute, which she joined after leaving the university, she made studies that led to acceptance in the United States of the psychological test created by Hermann Rorschach in Switzerland in 1921.         She is survived by a son, Eugene, of Reston; two daughters, Sheila, of Westport, Conn., and Mona Sharkey of Elverson, Pa.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

        Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal and family rivalries were critically acclaimed, died in her home here on Monday, her family announced today. She was 89 years old.         Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal and family rivalries were critically acclaimed, died in her home here on Monday, her family announced today. She was 89 years old.         Miss Lehmann's first novel, ''Dusty Answer,'' won immediate fame for the young author when it was published in 1927. The novel, about a girl's development from childhood to maturity, was praised for its candor, wit and psychological insight as well as for its lyrical, sensuous writing.         She followed this with ''A Note of Music'' in 1930, ''Invitation to the Waltz'' in 1932, ''The Weather in the Streets'' in 1936, ''The Ballad and the Source'' in 1944 and ''The Gypsy's Baby,'' a collection of short stories, in 1946.         Two Sisters, One Lover         Her next book was ''The Echoing Grove,'' about the relationship between two sisters and the man who is the husband of one and the lover of the other.         With shifts of time and approach, the same incidents in the book are seen through the eyes of different people.         The book was written after the bitter breakup of Miss Lehmann's love affair with the poet Cecil Day Lewis, and critics said it carried clear traces of that time in her life.         The soft-voiced author grew up in a large, comfortable home at Bourne End on the Thames near London. She was educated at Cambridge University.         Married 2 Future Lords         She met her first husband, Walter Runciman, who was later to become Lord Runciman, at Cambridge University. They married in 1923 and were divorced in 1928.         Later in 1928, she married Wogan Philipps, the eldest son of the first Lord Milford, the shipping magnate. They had two children, Hugo and Sally. That marriage ended in divorce in 1944.         Her grief over the death of her daughter from polio led her to spiritualism for a time. For many of her later years she was vice president of the privately financed College of Psychic Studies in London.         Toward the end of Miss Lehmann's life, the Virago Press, which specializes in works by women, republished many of her novels, introducing her work to a new generation of readers.         Queen Elizabeth II awarded Miss Lehmann the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1982.         She is survived by her son, Hugo.

Anne Tonetti Gugler, a Broadway actress and dancer who was a founding resident of an enclave of actors and artists in Rockland County, died of cardiac arrest on Thursday at her home in Orangetown, N.Y. She was 87 years old.         In her late teens, she took a leave from high school to dance with Isadora Duncan's troupe in Europe. In the 1920's, she had minor roles on Broadway in ''The Green Hat'' and ''Saturday's Children.''         She left acting to pursue a career in real estate and cultivate her native hamlet of Sneden's Landing in Orangetown, overlooking the Hudson River, as a community of artists, writers and actors. Mrs. Gugler was following in the steps of her mother, an artist, who acquired almost two dozen homes in the secluded hamlet around the turn of the century and sought out poets, actors and musicians as tenants.         Sneden's Landing eventually became a haven for artistic celebrities, including Noel Coward, Laurence Olivier, Ethel Barrymore, Katharine Cornell and E. B. White. Today, the actors Bill Murray and William Hurt own homes there, as does Mikhail Baryshnikov.         Mrs. Gugler's husband, the architect Eric Gugler, died in 1974. She is survived by a sister, Alexandra, of Santa Barbara, Calif.       
        Helen Hoke, who wrote nearly 100 children's books and set up and ran children's book divisions in five publishing companies, died of bronchial pneumonia on Monday in a nursing home in Bethesda, Md. She was 86 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         Helen Hoke, who wrote nearly 100 children's books and set up and ran children's book divisions in five publishing companies, died of bronchial pneumonia on Monday in a nursing home in Bethesda, Md. She was 86 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         Humor, natural history, the supernatural and witchcraft were the subjects of many of Ms. Hoke's books. She also specialized in anthologies of ghost stories, one of which she wrote with her grandson, Franklin Hoke.         Among her other books for young readers were ''The Horse That Took the Milk Around,'' ''Too Many Kittens,'' ''Factory Kitty'' and ''Grocery Kitty.''         In the late 1930's, Ms. Hoke inaugurated and managed children's book departments at several publishing houses, including Henry Holt, Reynal & Hitchcock and Julian Messer. In the 1940's, Ms. Hoke, whose first marriage, to John Hoke, had ended in divorce, married Franklin Watts, founder the New York publishing company that bears his name. She became the company's vice president and director of international projects.         She and her husband established Franklin Watts Ltd. in London in the 1960's, and Ms. Hoke worked there into the 1970's before returning to the United States. Ms. Hoke also organized Helen Hoke Associates, which represented authors, and oversaw publication of books from inception to marketing. Her son, John Hoke, said she was ''awfully good at finding new authors.''         In the 1970's she began naming her books with what she called ''Terrific Triple Titles.'' Among these books were, ''Witches, Witches, Witches,'' ''Jokes, Jokes, Jokes'' and ''Nurses, Nurses, Nurses,'' an anthology of short stories, poems and excerpts from biographies and novels.         Jean Vestal of Franklin Watts said one of Ms. Hoke's contributions to children's book publishing was her early support of the Bologna International Children's Book Fair in Italy, which has become an important element in the industry.         Ms. Hoke and her son, a photographer and writer, wrote ''Music Boxes: Their Lore and Lure'' in 1957. It was her 32d book and her first nonfiction work.         Ms. Hoke was also executive director of the Julia Ellsworth Ford Foundation, which conducted annual children's book competitions.         Surviving are her son, who lives in Bethesda, and four grandchildren.

        Evelyn K. Hill, who operated souvenir and food concessions at the Statue of Liberty for more than half a century, died of cardiac arrest yesterday at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Yonkers. She was 88 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Evelyn K. Hill, who operated souvenir and food concessions at the Statue of Liberty for more than half a century, died of cardiac arrest yesterday at St. Joseph's Medical Center in Yonkers. She was 88 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Mrs. Hill was born in Warsaw and came to New York as a teen-ager. There, she met and married Aaron G. Hill, a soldier who shortly after the end of World War I was stationed at Fort Wood, an Army post at the foot of the Statue of Liberty on what was then called Bedloes Island in New York Harbor.         When her husband was discharged, the couple obtained a concession to sell trinkets to visitors. They lived in one of several dozen brick and clapboard Army houses clustered on the island, and sent their children to school on Governors Island by boat.         In 1934, when the Department of the Interior took over what is now called Liberty Island, the several dozen houses were demolished and the Hill family moved to the Bronx.         Tourists From Around the World         Mrs. Hill's daughter, Charlotte Libauer, recalled yesterday that her parents commuted seven days a week by subway and boat to operate their souvenir and food stands. Mrs. Hill became conversant in several languages as she dealt with tourists from around the world.         Her husband died in 1943, but Mrs. Hill continued to operate the concessions and similar ones at Sagamore Hill, the Theodore Roosevelt estate in Oyster Bay, L.I., and Fort McKinley in Baltimore, which, like the Statue of Liberty, are administered by the National Park Service.         Until her final illness, Mrs. Hill was driven twice a week to Liberty Island to visit her concessions.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Baltimore, Mrs. Hill is survived by a son, James, of Manhasset, L.I.; two brothers, Jack and Ralph, both of Baltimore; four grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.

        Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Nancy Lady Keith, a legendary beauty and participant in the social scene of New York and Hollywood, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Lady Keith, known to her friends as Slim, had just completed her memoirs, ''Memories of a Rich and Imperfect Life,'' which is to be published later this year by Simon & Schuster.         Known for her wit and charm, she was a sought-after guest, a close friend of Ernest Hemingway, the Selznicks and much of Hollywood and New York society. Truman Capote, who called her ''Big Mama,'' was one of her closest friends until he wrote ''Answered Prayers,'' an article that caricatured New York society. After the article was published in Esquire she never spoke to Mr. Capote again.         In her later years her circle of friends included Mike Nichols and Jerome Robbins.         Married Hawks and Hayward         A native of Salinas, Calif., she acquired her title from her third husband, Lord Kenneth Keith, a British merchant banker, whom she married in 1962.         She was Mary Raye Gross at her birth on July 15, 1916, but her mother changed her name to Nancy. She grew up to be the kind of beauty that was sought after in Hollywood, although she never appeared in films. In her early 20's she became a regular guest at San Simeon, the Hearst estate, and in 1941 Gary Cooper gave her away when she married Howard Hawks, the director and producer. Their daughter, Kitty Hawks, survives her.         In 1946, 150 fashion editors and stylists named ''Slim'' Hawks the best-dressed woman of the year. The runner-up was the Duchess of Windsor. At the time, Mrs. Hawks was quoted as saying, ''I have a tall, skinny frame that clothes look well on. Seriously, just say that I'm a great believer in simplicity in clothes.''         In her Hollywood years she was credited with discovering and promoting such stars as Lauren Bacall, Joanne Dru and Ella Raines, all of whom resembled her somewhat in their casual, long-limbed type of good looks.         Two days after she and Mr. Hawks were divorced in 1949, she married Leland Hayward, the movie and theatrical producer, at the Manhasset, L.I., estate of William S. Paley. She and Mr. Hayward divorced in 1959 and three years later she married Kenneth Keith. They were divorced in 1972. ''I was married to each for about 10 years,'' she said at the time. ''I guess that's about all I can hack.''         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Theodora Andersen, of Burlingame, Calif., and four stepchildren, Alastaire Keith and Camilla Mackesson, the children of Lord Keith, and William Hayward and Brooke Hayward Duchin.

        Jill Ireland, the British-born movie actress who chronicled her long battle against breast cancer in a best-selling book, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Malibu, Calif. She was 54 years old.         Jill Ireland, the British-born movie actress who chronicled her long battle against breast cancer in a best-selling book, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Malibu, Calif. She was 54 years old.         Ms. Ireland, the wife of the actor Charles Bronson, told the story of her diagnosis, mastectomy, chemotherapy and self-discovery in her 1987 book, ''Life Wish.'' In The New York Times Book Review, Alison Friesinger praised the book for its ''wonderfully human details'' and said that it was ''constantly enlivened by Ms. Ireland's grace and fortitude.''         Ms. Ireland became a spokeswoman for the American Cancer Society, urging women with breast cancer to have self-respect and optimism. She also testified in 1988 about medical costs before a Congressional committee, and received the Medal of Courage from President Ronald Reagan.         An Early Career Start         Ms. Ireland began her film career at the age of 16, appearing in ''Oh Rosalinda,'' the first of 16 movies she made for the Rank Organization, a British production company. She also appeared in such films as ''Robbery Under Arms'' with her first husband, the actor David McCallum.         After moving to Hollywood in 1962, Ms. Ireland appeared in many television series, including ''Ben Casey,'' ''Daniel Boone,'' ''Mannix,'' ''Star Trek,'' ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' and ''Shane.'' She and Mr. McCallum were divorced in 1967 and a year later she married Charles Bronson. They starred together in many action-adventure movies, including ''Love and Bullets,'' ''Noon Till Three'' and ''Death Wish II.''         Coping With Adversity         Ms. Ireland also wrote of coping with adversity in her 1989 book, ''Life Lines.'' In it, she discussed her father's debilitating aphasia and the drug abuse of her adopted son, Jason, who subsequently died of a lethal drug combination. At the time of her death she was writing a third book, called ''Life Times.''         Ms. Ireland is survived by her husband; her parents, Jack and Dorothy Ireland, of Sussex, England; her brother, John Ireland, of Toronto, Ontario, and six children: Paul and Valentine McCallum; Suzanne, Tony and Zulieka Bronson, and Katrina Holden, all of Los Angeles.       
        Lucy Boston, a leading writer of children's fiction, died on Friday at her home, the Manor, a 12th-century Norman house at Hemingford Grey in Huntingdonshire, England, which provided the inspiration and setting for her influential ''Green Knowe'' books. She was 97 years old.         Lucy Boston, a leading writer of children's fiction, died on Friday at her home, the Manor, a 12th-century Norman house at Hemingford Grey in Huntingdonshire, England, which provided the inspiration and setting for her influential ''Green Knowe'' books. She was 97 years old.         The nearly 20 works by Mrs. Boston, who began writing in her 60's, were noted for delicacy and imagination and for extolling nature's virtues. Most were books for juveniles. Her first book, ''The Children of Green Knowe,'' was praised in The New Yorker in 1955 as ''an uncommon tale with a gratifying blend of the eerie, the sinister and the familiar.''         Mrs. Boston, an energetic woman who wrote during the cold months and gardened in the summers on her four-acre estate, suffered two strokes in March, according to her son, Peter, an architect in nearby Cambridge, who illustrated most of her books.         Translated and Televised         The works were widely used in schools, translated into many languages and televised by the BBC. ''The Children of Green Knowe'' received a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1969, and ''A Stranger at Green Knowe'' earned the Carnegie Medal in Britain in 1962.         The ''stranger'' of the title was an escaped gorilla befriended and hidden by an orphaned Chinese boy. ''The book encapsulates the best qualities of her work,'' said The Times of London, which went on to list ''a crystal-clear style of storytelling, a respect for the innocence and intelligence of the young reader, a serious treatment of supernatural phenomena, a regard for all natural life and a belief that a man-centered conception of the world is false and crippling.''         In 1970, Mrs. Boston described her professional objectives thus: ''To remind adults of joy, now considered obsolete - and to encourage children to use and trust their senses for themselves at first hand - their ears, eyes and noses, their fingers and the soles of their feet, their skins and their breathing, their muscular joy and rhythms and heartbeats, their instinctive loves and pity and their awe of the unknown.''         An Early Foe of Pollution         The former Lucy Maria Wood was born on Dec. 10, 1892, in Southport, Lancashire, into a devout Methodist family. Her father was an engineer. She attended Somerville College at Oxford for a year and left to serve as a nurse in France in World War I. She married Harold Boston, then an officer in the Royal Flying Corps. They settled in Cheshire, where she became an early campaigner against industrial pollution.         The couple were divorced in 1935, and Mrs. Boston studied painting on the Continent until she returned home in early 1939, on the eve of World War II. It was then that she bought the crumbling 12th-century manor, which she soon transformed into one of the oldest habitable homes in England.         Surviving, besides her son, are two granddaughters and two stepgrandsons.       
        Mary Lea Johnson Richards, a founder and partner of the Producer Circle, a New York film and theatrical production company, died yesterday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh, where she had a liver transplant two weeks ago. She was 63 years old and had homes in New York, Southampton, L.I., and Boca Raton,         Mary Lea Johnson Richards, a founder and partner of the Producer Circle, a New York film and theatrical production company, died yesterday at Presbyterian University Hospital in Pittsburgh, where she had a liver transplant two weeks ago. She was 63 years old and had homes in New York, Southampton, L.I., and Boca Raton, Fla.         Since it was formed in 1976, the Producer Circle - founded by Mrs. Richards with her husband, Martin Richards, Robert Fryer and James Cresson - won 22 Tony Awards. It produced such Broadway shows as ''On the Twentieth Century,'' ''Sweeney Todd,'' ''La Cage aux Folles,'' ''Crimes of the Heart,'' which won a Pulitzer Prize, and ''Grand Hotel.'' Its Off Broadway productions included ''March of the Falsettos'' and ''Mayor.'' Among the company's films were ''The Boys From Brazil,'' ''The Shining'' and ''Fort Apache, the Bronx.''         Mrs. Richards was born on Aug. 20, 1926, in New Brunswick, N.J. She was the oldest daughter of J. Seward Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune, and his first wife, Ruth Dill Johnson. She was a graduate of the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., and the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Murder Plot Charged         Mrs. Richards's first marriage, to William Ryan, a farmer and a newspaper editor, ended in divorce. She made headlines in 1976 when she charged that her second husband, Dr. Victor D'Arc, a New York psychiatrist, had hired men to have her murdered. The Bronx District Attorney's office opened an investigation in the case, but no charges were ever brought. The couple was divorced in 1978.         Five years later, after the death of her father, Mrs. Richards and her brothers and sisters went to Surrogates Court in Manhattan to challenge his last will, which disinherited five of his six children and left the vast bulk of his $350 million estate to his third wife, Barbara Piasecka Johnson of Princeton. N.J. The case, the largest inheritance contest in the history of New York, went through 14 weeks of trial in 1986 before it was settled out of court, with the children dividing up about 12 percent of the total.         In addition to her husband, Martin Richards of New York, Mrs. Richards is survived by two brothers, J. Seward Johnson Jr. of Princeton, and James L. Johnson of Pottersville, N.J.; three sisters, Diana Firestone of Waterford, Va., Elaine Wold of Boca Raton and Jennifer Duke of Jacksonville, Fla.; five sons, Eric Ryan of New York; Seward, Hillary and Quentin Ryan of Hilton Head, S.C., and Roderick Ryan, of Andover, N.J.; one daughter, Alice Ryan Marriott, also of Hilton Head; and 10 grandchildren.       
        Barbra Walz, a fashion photographer known as much for her informal pictures of designers as for their clothes, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 39 years old. The cause of death was breast cancer, her husband, Kevin, said.         Barbra Walz, a fashion photographer known as much for her informal pictures of designers as for their clothes, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 39 years old. The cause of death was breast cancer, her husband, Kevin, said.         ''She first came to see me at the beach about 15 years ago when my kids were little,'' Ralph Lauren recalled. ''She was a very sparkly girl, and her pictures were great. The ones she did of my family are hanging in my office today.''         When she was starting as a photographer, after studying at Pratt Institute, Mrs. Walz heard Jill Krementz in a lecture at New York University tell how she had decided to concentrate on photographing authors.         ''She then decided to specialize in fashion,'' Miss Krementz said. ''I guess I was her mentor. She turned out to be not only a superb technician, but a woman of wit and wisdom, a photographer with a warm generous heart.''         The Entertaining Insight         In the introduction to her first book, ''The Fashion Makers,'' published in 1978, when designers were achieving the star status of athletes and entertainers, Mrs. Walz described her approach. ''I always tried to bring out some part of their personality for the public to see,'' she wrote. ''I found a magic in the designers I photographed. I also became aware that the public was reaching to them on a new level and they had become celebrities.''         She photographed her subjects in bathtubs, gymnasiums, dental offices and beauty parlors to capture the entertaining insight into their personalities. For a study of Elsa Peretti, Mrs. Waltz went to Spain and photographed the designer in her pool. Despite having lost a leg to cancer when she was 15, Mrs. Walz climbed a 12-foot ladder to find the right angle.         Not all of her subjects were in the fashion field. ''Starring Mothers,'' about well-known mothers and their children, was published in 1987, after her own two daughters had been born. Mrs. Walz's subjects included Diane Feinstein, Patti Labelle, Sally Quinn and Carly Simon. It was considered one of the best photographic books of the year and was included in a group show by the International Center of Photography.         Her subjects for 15 cover stories for The New York Times Magazine included E. L. Doctorow, Joseph Papp and Stephen Sondheim. Her photographs also appeared in GQ, Metropolitan Home, Parade, Rolling Stone and Town & Country.         Surviving are her husband, a furniture and interior designer, their children, Jersey, and Addison, and her parents, Stanley and Pauline Turner, of Toms River, N.J.

        Ina Balin, a film and stage actress whose adoption of three Vietnamese orphans was dramatized in a 1980 television movie in which she played herself, died yesterday at the Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 52 years old and lived in Westport, Conn.         Ina Balin, a film and stage actress whose adoption of three Vietnamese orphans was dramatized in a 1980 television movie in which she played herself, died yesterday at the Yale-New Haven Hospital.

Ms. Balin became associated with a Saigon orphanage, An Lac, in 1970, when she visited it while touring with a U.S.O. show.         Five years later, in the final days of the Vietnam War, she and an another American, Betty Tisdale, helped evacuate children from the orphanage to the United States, and Ms. Balin, who was unmarried, adopted three girls. Two were infants; the other was a 16-year-old who was hidden aboard an evacuation plane, the actress said, because she was half black and so faced a dismal future in South Vietnam.         ''Adopting those children was the best thing I've ever done in my whole life,'' the Brooklyn-born actress told an interviewer shortly before her story was told on CBS in ''The Children of An Lac.'' ''It gives you a whole other perspective on life. It gets you involved with someone other than yourself, because children truly need you.''         Praised in Broadway Debut         Ms. Balin won critical praise for her Broadway debut in 1957 in ''Compulsion''; Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times said her portrayal of a convict's friend was ''tenderly moving.'' In 1959, she appeared in ''A Majority of One'' as the daughter of a housewife played by Gertrude Berg.         That year Ms. Balin also made her screen debut as Anthony Quinn's daughter in ''The Black Orchid.'' Her other films included ''From the Terrace'' (1960), ''The Young Doctors'' (1961), ''The Comancheros'' (1961), ''The Patsy'' (1964), ''The Greatest Story Every Told'' (1965), ''Charro!'' (1969) and ''The Projectionist'' (1971).         Ms. Balin, who traveled widely, was also a published photographer and was the co-owner of the Balin-Traube Art Gallery in New York, which operated on East 74th Street for three years in the early 1960's.         She is survived by her father, Sam Rosenberg of Hallandale, Fla; her daughters, Ba-Nhi Mai and Kim Thuy, both of Westport, and Nguyet Baty of Berlin; a brother, Richard Balin of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren.         A memorial service is scheduled for tomorrow at 11 A.M. at the Spear Funeral Home, 39 South Benson Road, Fairfield, Conn.

Her books included ''Poppet'' (1949) and ''Brave John Henry'' (1955).         She also wrote and drew for Jack and Jill magazine, and she illustrated books for Platt & Murk publications.         She was born in Portland, Ore., and attended the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League in New York City.         She is survived by her husband, Darrel Austin; a son, Darrel Jr., of Newtown, Conn., and a brother, Barney Helser, of Portland.       
        Berenice Robinson Morris, a composer, teacher and editor, died on Friday in Mount Vernon Hospital. She was 81 years old and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         Berenice Robinson Morris, a composer, teacher and editor, died on Friday in Mount Vernon Hospital. She was 81 years old and lived in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         Mrs. Morris's son Jeffrey Brandon Morris said she died after a brief illness.         Mrs. Morris studied composition at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and the Juilliard Graduate School in New York. Her works include instrumental, chamber, symphonic and choral works, as well as Jewish liturgical music. She taught at Long Island University and was a Fulbright Lecturer in music at the Free University of Berlin in 1969.         The three volumes of her history for children, ''American Popular Music,'' was published between 1970 and 1974. She was music editor of both the ''Encyclopedia of American History'' and ''Harper's Encyclopedia of the Modern World.'' Her late husband, Richard B.

In addition to Mr. Morris, of Philadelphia, she is survived by a son, Donald Robinson Morris of Cheyenne, Wyo.; a brother, Donald Robinson, of New York City, and five grandchildren.       
        Peggy Mann Houlton, the author of more than 35 books and many magazine articles, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Peggy Mann Houlton, the author of more than 35 books and many magazine articles, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Houlton died of breast cancer, her family said.         At a Congressional reception in 1985, Mrs. Houlton, who wrote under her maiden name, Peggy Mann, was honored as one of the nation's foremost authors of books and articles about preventing drug abuse. Her ''Marijuana Alert'' (1985), about drug-abuse prevention for adults, was based on an article she wrote for the Reader's Digest in 1979.         Many of Mrs. Houlton's books were for teen-agers and younger children. These include ''Arrive Alive: How to Keep Drunk and Drugged Drivers Off the Road'' and ''Twelve Is Too Old,'' a novel about tobacco and marijuana.         Mrs. Houlton was born in Manhattan, and was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin. Her first novel for adults, ''A Room in Paris,'' which was published in 1955, is about the lives and loves of a young American art student in France.         A TV Special         Some of her other books include ''Golda,'' a biography of Golda Meir, the former Prime Minister of Israel; ''The Last Escape,'' about a woman's mission to smuggle Jews out of Nazi-occupied Europe into Palestine; ''My Dad Lives in a Downtown Hotel,'' and ''The Street of the Flower Boxes.'' ''The Street of the Flower Boxes'' inspired an NBC television special in the 1970's that won a Peabody Award and that inspired a movement for neighborhood beautification.         The National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth recently established the Peggy Mann Scholarship Award for Outstanding Youth Involved in Substance-Use Prevention. Beginning next year, annual $1,000 college scholarships are to be given to students from each of the 50 states, Guam and Puerto Rico who have made distinguished contributions to their community and school-based drug-prevention programs.         She is survived by her husband, William, and two daughters, Jenny and Betsy Houlton, all of New York City and Fair Harbor, L.I.; a brother, John Mann of Conesus, N.Y., and her mother, Edna Mann of New York City.         Funeral services are to be held today at 10:30 A.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street.       
        Lady Ashton, better known as Madge Garland, who was fashion editor of English Vogue in the 1930's and founded the Royal College of Art's Fashion School, has died, according to news reports on Wednesday. She was 92 years old.         Lady Ashton, better known as Madge Garland, who was fashion editor of English Vogue in the 1930's and founded the Royal College of Art's Fashion School, has died, according to news reports on Wednesday. She was 92 years old.         She had been cared for at a London convent in recent years and died on Sunday, The Times of London reported. It gave no cause of death.  She was born Madge McHarg on in Melbourne, Australia. She grew up in London and became a journalist in the 1920's, first working for English Vogue with the novelist Aldous Huxley and the photographer Cecil Beaton, and later freelancing for Women's Wear Daily in the United States.         She returned to English Vogue as fashion editor in 1933.         During World War II, she became merchandising manager for the Bourne and Hollingsworth department store here, and designed some fashion.         In 1948, she founded the first British school of fashion, at the invitation of the Royal College of Art. She remained at its head until 1956.         She produced five books on fashion and the history of costumes.         She was married in the 1920's to Capt. Ewart Garland. In 1953, she married Sir Leigh Ashton, then director of the Victoria and Albert Museum; they were divorced in 1962. She had no children.

Mark, a leader in the Girl Scouts of America and in social work organizations, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Mark died of multiple sclerosis, a spokesman for the family said.         She was formerly a member of the national board of the Girl Scouts of America, chairwoman of its committee on public information and co-chairwoman of its committee on religious policy.

She was 82 years old and lived in San Juan.         Ines Mendoza de Munoz, the widow of Luis Munoz Marin, the longtime Governor of Puerto Rico, died Monday at a hospital in Rio Piedras, a suburb of San Juan. She was 82 years old and lived in San Juan.         Officials of the Commonwealth said she died of a heart attack.         Gov. Rafael Hernandez Colon declared an official three-day period of mourning and ordered flags at public sites to be flown at half-staff.         Known widely and affectionately as Dona Ines, Mrs. Munoz was Puerto Rico's First Lady for the 16 years her husband was Governor.

        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, had accompanied her to the hospital.         The singer left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had a fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in-promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century by the languorous sexuality of her throaty voice as well as by the directness of her personality. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical ''Hello Dolly!,'' which she played on Broadway from 1967 to 1969.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' Miss Bailey once remarked in attempting to describe herself. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune.''         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.''         Won Award in 1946         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in night clubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey's received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Helly, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.         Correction:  August 25, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary of Pearl Bailey in some editions last Saturday and some on Sunday referred incompletely to her co-stars in the Broadway musical ''Hello, Dolly!,'' and a correction in this space on Tuesday misidentified the actor with whom she first performed the role. Cab Calloway starred with Miss Bailey in a 1967 staging of the musical, and Billy Daniels appeared with her in a 1975 revival.       
        Bess Goodykoontz, an educator who served as Assistant United States Commissioner of Education in the 1930's and 40's, died Sunday at her daughter's home in South Newfane, Vt. She was 95 years old.         Bess Goodykoontz, an educator who served as Assistant United States Commissioner of Education in the 1930's and 40's, died Sunday at her daughter's home in South Newfane, Vt. She was 95 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said.         A graduate of the University of Iowa, Dr. Goodykoontz taught at rural schools in Iowa and Wisconsin and at the University of Pittsburgh before being appointed to the No. 2 position in the Bureau of Education, as it was known. She served as Assistant Commissioner from 1929 to 1946, was director of the elementary education division from 1946 to 1949 and was then named Associate Commissioner of Education. In 1951 she became director of comparative education. She was later in charge of international education relations.         Saw Use for 'Talkies'         Dr. Goodykoontz was with the Office of Education, a precursor to a Cabinet department, in the crisis brought on by the Great Depression and later by World War II. In 1932 she advocated use of ''talkies'' in the classroom, writing, ''The sound film appears to be a particularly effective method of instruction for backward children.''         In 1935 she called for an increase in education programs for people mired in the Depression, and early in World War II she advocated day care so mothers could work in arms plants.         She was a member and official of many education organizations and was vice president of the United States National Committee for Childhood Education and of the World Organization for Childhood Education.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen Darrow of South Newfane, and three grandchildren.

A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         In a stage career that began in 1933 when she won first prize at an amateur night in Philadelphia and reached a peak with her 1967 starring role on Broadway in an all-black version of the musical ''Hello, Dolly!'' with Cab Calloway, Miss Bailey said she thought of herself as a singer and not an actress.         'I Tell Stories to Music'         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' she told an interviewer some years ago. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people who call me an actress.''         Her trademark was a warm, lusty singing voice accompanied by an easy smile and elegant gestures that charmed audiences and translated smoothly from the nightclub stage and Broadway to film and television.         On stage her ample figure, often swathed in fur and sparkling with rhinestones and jewels, was a magnet for audience attention as she tossed off a ballad in throwaway style.         ''I've lost one of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life,'' Mr. Calloway said after learning of Miss Bailey's death. ''I've lost a co-worker and a wonderful person.''         Carol Channing, who had created the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical three years before Miss Bailey undertook the part, said: ''The entertainment world has lost one of its most creative performers of our time. Her talent was unique and enduring.''         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, to whom she was married for 38 years and who went with her to the hospital on Friday, said simply, ''I've lost my best friend.''         The singer had left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.

One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in nightclubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Hello, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.

        Bertha Lindsay, the last surviving eldress of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming, known as the Shaker Society, died Wednesday at her home at Shaker Village in Canterbury, N.H. She was 93 years old.         Bertha Lindsay, the last surviving eldress of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming, known as the Shaker Society, died Wednesday at her home at Shaker Village in Canterbury, N.H. She was 93 years old.         She apparently died of a stroke, said Dr. Scott Swank, director of the village.         Sister Ethel Hudson, who is 94, is now the last of a community of Shakers in Canterbury that once numbered 400 men, women and children. The community, founded in 1792, was a communal society of shared property; followers were devoted to celibacy, living simply and pacifism. The Shakers in Canterbury once owned about 4,000 acres, most of which is being preserved. About 690 acres remain, and efforts are under way to have that too remain free of development.         There is one other Shaker community in the country, in Sabbathday Lake, Me. It has four covenanted members and four others who follow the Shaker practices.         History of Sect         The Shakers, who included free-form and choreographed dance in their worship, were an offshoot of the Shaking Quakers from England. They are thought to have derived their name from a belief that shaking from religious fervor was a manifestation of inner spiritual experience.         Miss Lindsay came to Canterbury in 1905 as an orphan. She lost her sight when she was 90 years old and put her remaining energies into making audio recordings about the history of the movement. ''I want people to know we did have fun and plenty of it,'' she said in an interview.         She is survived by a niece.       
        Corinna Reiman Marsh, an editor and a writer of verse and children's books, died on Monday at New York Hospital. She was 98 years and old and had lived in an apartment at Le Marquis Hotel on East 31st Street for more than 40 years before moving earlier this year to the Mary Manning Walsh nursing home.         Corinna Reiman Marsh, an editor and a writer of verse and children's books, died on Monday at New York Hospital. She was 98 years and old and had lived in an apartment at Le Marquis Hotel on East 31st Street for more than 40 years before moving earlier this year to the Mary Manning Walsh nursing home.         She died of pneumonia, a family spokeswoman, Jane Furth, said.         Throughout a long literary career Mrs. Marsh was an inveterate writer of letters to editors, authors, political figures and government agencies. She carried on extensive correspondence with figures like Eleanor Roosevelt and Adlai Stevenson. Her letters to editors were frequently published in The New York Times and other journals on a wide variety of subjects that caught her fancy.         She was a sharp critic of political polls (''fortune telling''), she opposed Sunday parades on Fifth Avenue (she lived a few steps off the avenue), and she was ever alert to catch misuse of the English language in print (she had taught English in her youth).         Crossing Words With Buckley         A decade ago Mrs. Marsh told an interviewer that she wrote to editors because ''it's important to let people know what you're thinking.'' One of the most frequent recipients of her letters was William F. Buckley Jr., whose conservatism rankled Mrs. Marsh's liberal bent.         She recalled that when the two finally met after she had been writing barb-encrusted letters to him for more than 10 years, he took her aside and said, ''I hope now you'll tell your friends I don't bite.'' To which she replied, ''And I hope you'll tell your friends that I do.''         Mrs. Marsh was born in Manhattan on Dec. 12, 1891. She was class poet at Barnard when she graduated in 1914. After teaching for several years she wrote advertising copy and children's books and for many years contributed light verse to newspapers and magazines.         For four decades she was editor in chief of the University Society, publisher of educational materials. In the last 15 years her verse and her letters to editors have been concerned mainly with debunking sentimental attitudes toward old age.         Eight years ago, when a 63-year-old man wrote The New York Times to urge his contemporaries to face the fact that ''old is old is old,'' Mrs. Marsh took pen to reply:         ''Old at 63? People of that age 'senile, incompetent, deteriorated'? Maybe. But because of their age? ''I am 91 years of age and am fortunate enough still to have a goodly number of contemporaneous pals. Some of us may not see or hear or walk as well as we used to but, by golly, we are alert, interested, amused and amusing, as well as busy.''         Among her books are ''Flippy's Flashlight'' a children's book published by Dutton in 1958.         Mrs. Marsh is survived by a grandson, a great-grandson and several cousins.       
        Beatrice Behrman, an innovative doll maker who founded the Alexander Doll Company in Manhattan and owned it for 65 years, died on Wednesday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla.

Beatrice Behrman, an innovative doll maker who founded the Alexander Doll Company in Manhattan and owned it for 65 years, died on Wednesday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 95 years old.  She died in her sleep, a spokesman for the company said.         Mrs. Behrman, who was known as Madame Alexander, began designing dolls for her father, a Russian emigre, during World War I, when she began making ''Red Cross Nurse'' rag dolls. In 1923 she founded the Alexander Doll Company, in which she produced rag dolls with innovative three-dimensional facial features that she hand-painted. In the 1930's she began making dolls with lifelike details like eyes with lashes that closed and fingers with knuckles.         With the advent of plastic after World War II, she made dolls with vinyl heads and elaborate hair that could be styled. She also created designer clothing for the dolls and received international attention. In 1953, a collection of her dolls featuring, in authentic detail, Queen Elizabeth I and 35 principals at her coronation was presented to the Brooklyn Children's Museum.         In 1965, she was honored by the United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Arthur Goldberg, for her collection of international dolls that featured the native dress of every country represented at the U.N.         She also created dolls that portrayed characters in books and movies like Alice in Wonderland, Orphan Annie, Nancy Drew, the four sisters in ''Little Women'' and characters from Charles Dickens's books. Her ''Madame'' doll, based on the American Revolution, and her ''Scarlett O'Hara'' doll, portraying the Civil War era in ''Gone with the Wind,'' were included in the Smithsonian Institution in 1968.         She also designed children's clothing and won four Fashion Academy gold medals. Her company, which was sold two years ago to two New York businessmen, has created more than 5,000 different dolls at its factory in on West 131st Street in Harlem, where it has about 600 employees and is one of the area's largest employers. Many of the dolls have become collectors' items and sell for about $5,000.         She is survived by a daughter, Mildren Birnbaum of Purchase, N.Y., and Boca Raton, Fla.; a grandson, and a great-granddaughter.

Ms. Gruber was instrumental in the redesign of Earnshaw's Magazine and the introduction of Plus Sizes. She had been a senior editor of Lebar Friedman Publications.         She is survived by her husband, Shelly; a daughter, Monica Meyer and a son, Kenneth Meyer, both of Greenvale; her parents, Bolling and Marguerite Ellis of Troy, N.Y.; a sister, Victoria Pelinski of Ballston Lake, N.Y., and two stepdaughters, Alexis and Jessica Gruber of Canton, Ohio.

         Miriam M. Comer, a founder of two community agencies in Great Neck, L.I., died on Monday at a nursing home there. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Comer, who suffered from Alzheimer's disease, died of respiratory failure, her son, Charles, of Port Washington, L.I., said.         In the early 1950's, Mrs. Comer was a founder of what is now the United Community Fund of Great Neck and the United Neighborhood Activities Center, an after-school program for poor children that is no longer operating.         A widow, she is survived by a second son, Harry, of Poughkeepsie, N.Y.; four daughters, Miriam Mayer of South Orange, N.J., Carolyn Comer of Port Washington, Marguerite Jansen of Appleton, Wis., and Janet Bryars of Papillion, Neb.; a brother, Robert Hoffman of Coconut Creek, Fla; 13 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.       
         Anya Seton, the author of several popular historical and biographical novels, two of which were made into successful films, died on Thursday at her home in Old Greenwich, Conn. She was 86 years old.         She had been ill for several years and died of heart failure, a daughter, Pamela Cottier Forcey, said.         Miss Seton developed a devoted following from the 1940's to the 1970's for her carefully researched and evocative works, two of which, "Dragonwyck" and "Foxfire," were made into successful films. She won critical praise for her attention to the language and life style of the periods she wrote about, but she was frequently faulted for reworking familiar ground.  A First Book at 37         The daughter of a celebrated English author, artist and naturalist, Ernest Thompson Seton, and an American writer of travel books, Grace Gallatin, Miss Seton did not produce her first successful book until she was 37 years old. She had married the first of her two husbands when she was 18 and raised three children before turning seriously to writing.         She began selling short stories to newspapers -- her first brought her a check for $5 -- and in the late 1930's became interested in the story of Aaron Burr's daughter, Theodosia, a celebrated beauty of her time who died mysteriously.         Miss Seton decided to apply a fictional treatment to the woman's life and the result was "My Theodosia," published in 1941 and well received by critics and the public.         "Dragonwyck," her second published novel, gained international recognition. A Gothic tale set along the Hudson River in the 1840's, it was serialized by the Ladies' Home Journal, selected by the Dollar Book Club, translated into nine languages and made into a film starring Vincent Price as a feudal overlord who tyrannizes his tenant farmers, kills his wife and takes up with a distant relative, played by Gene Tierney. Role for Vincent Price         The film, released in 1946, was adapted by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and was his first directorial effort; it established him as a major force in movies and set a villainous style for Mr. Price that he was to repeat many times.         That year Miss Seton followed with "The Turquoise," a novel of the American Southwest in the 1890's, inspired by visits to her father's ranch in New Mexico. Two years later came "The Hearth and the Eagle," set in Marblehead on the Massachusetts coast.         For each of her books, Miss Seton spent a good deal of time getting to know the locale about which she was writing.         "It is impossible for me to describe or 'feel' any place to which I have not been," she once said. "I am inspired by places." "Dragonwyck," "The Turquoise," "The Hearth and the Eagle" and "Foxfire," the latter set in an Arizona ghost town and made into a 1955 film starring Jane Russell and Jeff Chandler, all resulted from visits to places which, Miss Seton said, "suddenly became meaningful." Dark Romances         But her favorite books were her biographical novels. Besides "My Theodosia" these included "Katherine" (1954), the story of the mistress of John of Gaunt; "The Winthrop Woman" (1958), about the niece and daughter-in-law of John Winthrop, Governor of Massachusetts, and "Devil Water" (1962), "Avalon" (1965) and "Green Darkness" (1973), all of which take place in England and tell of dark romances.         Miss Seton was born in Manhattan and raised in Cos Cob, Conn., where her family had an estate. She was christened Ann, but a family friend, a Sioux chief, gave her the Indian name Anutika, which her family adapted to Anya. She traveled extensively with her parents; by the time she was 13 she had crossed the Atlantic eight times. She had private tutors much of the time but graduated from the Spence School.         Miss Seton was twice married and divorced. Her son, Seton Cottier, died in 1979. She is survived by Mrs. Forcey, who lives in Manhattan, and another daughter, Clemency Chase Coggins of Auburndale, Mass.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Lucy S. Dawidowicz, a scholar of Jewish life and history whose book "The War Against the Jews" is widely regarded as a pioneering study of the Nazi genocide, died early Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 75 years old and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, the daughter of Polish immigrants, was at the center of the study of the modern Jewish experience at Yeshiva University, where she held a chair in interdisciplinary Holocaust studies. Early in her career, in the immediate aftermath of World War II, she went to Europe, where she helped Jewish survivors of the war to re-create schools and libraries, and she recovered vast collections of books seized by the Nazis.         Before that, while in her early 20's, she had lived in Vilna, Poland, from 1938 to 1939, where she witnessed the onslaught of European anti-Semitism, writing about the experience in a memoir, "From That Place and Time," published by W. W. Norton last year. Her other books include "The Jewish Presence" (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich) in 1977 and "The Holocaust and the Historians" (Harvard University Press), a critical survey of scholarship on the Holocaust, in 1981. Hopes Turn to Agonies         "There was a certain irony to my trip to Vilna," Mrs. Dawidowicz told an interviewer for Publisher's Weekly last year, speaking of her pre-war experience in Poland. "I went there with the romantic belief that it might become the world center for a self-sustaining Yiddish culture."         When she saw what turned out to be the beginning of the end of Jewish life in Poland, she immersed herself in Yiddish literature and Jewish history, so that she could help to preserve Jewish culture in the postwar world.         Mrs. Dawidowicz (pronounced dah-vee-DOH-vich), a small energetic woman who spoke in the accents of the Bronx, engaged in heated arguments within Jewish circles over both the nature of the Holocaust and the responsibility of American Jews for not doing more to prevent it.         Her major work, "The War Against the Jews," postulates that the destruction of the Jews was a central and inescapable element in Nazi ideology and was always a principle war aim of Hitler, just as important as his military conquest of Europe. In this view, she conflicted with other historians, who believed that the Holocaust was not a necessary part of the Nazi program but evolved in response to such circumstances as the defeats on the Eastern front.  Evidence Over Passion         "The War Against the Jews" (Holt, Rinehart & Winston) was called "a work of high scholarship and profound moral import" by Irving Howe, in his review in The New York Times Book Review. It is marked above all by its sobriety. Mrs. Dawidowicz allows the coolly accumulated weight of detail -- the growing force of the Nazi's anti-Semitic juggernaut, the evolution of the camps as places of scientific murder, the efforts by the victims to hold onto fragments of normal life -- to create its emotional and intellectual impact.         Mrs. Dawidowicz refused to judge the failure of the Jews themselves to mount a more active resistance to the genocide, and in this she clashed bitterly with a number of other historians.         Her belief was twofold. First, she felt it morally inappropriate for those who did not face the persecutions themselves to criticize the behavior of those who did. Second, she felt that in any case, Jewish resistance was doomed to failure. Given the Jews' isolation, their lack of arms and the overwhelming material superiority of their enemies, there was virtually nothing they could have done to alter their fate, she wrote.  Defended Role of Jews         In her book "The Holocaust and the Historians," Mrs. Davidowicz is critical of a number of historians and commentators -- Bruno Bettelheim, Hannah Arendt and Raul Hilberg are among those she mentions -- who described the European Jews during the war as passive, cowardly or, in the case of the Judenrat, set up by the Nazis as self-governing boards in the ghettos, even collaborationist.         Similarly, Mrs. Dawidowicz rejected a chorus of opinion to the effect that Jews in the United States were guilty of complacency and a failure to react effectively to the Holocaust.         In articles in Commentary magazine and The New York Times, she wrote, first, that the Jews here did undertake wipespread efforts to awaken the government and world opinion to the fate of the European Jews. Second, she argued that, in any case, whatever might have been done here, the Jews of Europe were caught in a vise from which virtually no escape was ever possible. The only way to save them, she believed, was to militarily defeat the Nazis as quickly as possible, and that fact justified the Allies' concentration on the war effort, rather than on efforts to save the Jews.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, whose maiden name was Lucy Schildkret, was born in New York in 1915 and educated at Hunter College and Columbia University. She recounts in "From That Time and Place" how she began to work for YIVO's Manhattan branch after her year in Vilna. She met her husband, Szymon Dawidowicz, an escapee from Poland there. Mr. Dawidowicz died in 1979.         Mrs. Dawidowicz, who had no children, is survived by her sister, Eleanor Sapak.       
         Adele Sharpe Herzman, who with her husband was a collector of Chinese ceramics, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71 years old.         She died of cancer, her husband, Stanley, said.         In recent years, the couple donated pieces from their collection of Chinese ceramics or promised them as gifts to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where a major portion of the collection was exhibited in the summer. It is one of only three major holdings of Chinese ceramics given or promised to the museum since World War II.         Mrs. Herzman was also a co-founder of the auxiliary board of the New York Philharmonic.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two children from previous marriages, a daughter, Lucia Scott of Stamford, Conn., and a son, Guy Thomas of Manchester, Vt.; two sisters, Dorothy Lewis of St. Louis and Ruth Hamilton of Nashville, and four grandchildren.       
         Meg Wohlberg, an illustrator who specialized in images of babies and children, died on Monday at Brookhaven at Lexington, a retirement center in Lexington, Mass. She was 85 years old.         She died of pneumonia, said John R. Whitman of Kirchoff/Wohlberg Inc., which represents illustrators and authors of children's books. The company was founded by Ms. Wohlberg's sister, Helen, who represented the artist at the start of her career.         Ms. Wohlberg grew up in New York City and studied art at the Rochester Atheneum, now the Rochester Institute of Technology, and at the National Academy of Design in New York.         In the 1930's, she illustrated advertisements for products including Ivory Soap, Gerber Baby Food and Johnson & Johnson baby-care products. In the 1950's, 60's and 70's, she illustrated more than 70 children's books, including three pop-up books that she wrote herself, and the "Andy Books," a series published by William Morrow & Company.         Ms. Wohlberg is survived by her husband, Jerome Eisenberg, and her sister, Helen Wohlberg Lambert, both of Lexington.       
         Nan Wood Graham, the model for the tight-lipped farm woman in the painting "American Gothic," died Friday in a nursing home in Menlo Park, Calif. She was 91 years old.         The 1930 painting by her brother Grant Wood, the regionalist artist, portrays a somber farmer bearing a pitchfork and his equally somber daughter standing before a cottage in Eldon in southeast Iowa. The model for the farmer was Dr. Byron McKeeby, a dentist who lived in the Woods' hometown of Anamosa, Iowa.         The painting initially provoked complaints in Cedar Rapids, where some women protested that Mrs. Graham was poking fun at them with her dour depiction of an Iowa farm woman. One woman wrote to say Mrs. Graham's face would "sour milk."         But the painting, and Mrs. Graham, eventually gained wide popularity in her home state.         If her brother had gone through with his original intention of using another model, the secretarial school graduate said she would have whiled away her days as "the world's worst stenographer."         "Grant made a personality out of me," she once said. "I would have had a very drab life without it."         She was protective of "American Gothic," bringing suit several times against the frequent caricatures and parodies. The painting is kept at the Art Institute of Chicago. Her brother died in 1942.         Born in Anamosa, she attended Polk School and Washington High School in Cedar Rapids. In 1924, she married a real estate investor, Edward Graham. The couple settled in Riverside, Calif., and had no children.         In 1984, widowed and going blind, Mrs. Graham entered a Menlo Park nursing home, ending a lifetime job as historian of her brother's work.

         Ilse Bischoff, an illustrator and writer, died on Dec. 5 at her home in Hartland, Vt. She was 89 years old.         She died of Parkinson's disease, said her agent, David Stewart Hull.         She illustrated 12 books, published from 1928 and 1946. She wrote two novels about George Washington's portraitist, Gilbert Stuart: "Proud Heritage" (1949) and "Painter's Coach" (1943). Her autobiography was titled "Drive Slowly: Six Dogs" (1953). That same year, a children's book she wrote and illustrated, "The Wonderful Poodle," was published.         She studied in Munich, Germany, and at the Art Students League in New York City. Her work is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Hood Museum at Dartmouth.       
         Fay Stanley Shulman, former chief advertising writer for Faberge Inc. and a novelist, died on Friday at the New England Baptist Hospital in Boston. She was 69 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said her daughter, Diane Stanley Vennema of Houston.         Mrs. Shulman was chief advertising copywriter for Faberge from the early 1970's until she retired in 1985.         Under the name of Fay Stanley, she wrote several books, the first of which was a mystery, "Murder Leaves A Ring," published in 1950 by Holt Rinehart & Winston Inc. Her last book, a joint venture with her daughter, an illustrator of children's books, is titled "The Last Princess: Kaiulani of Hawaii." It is scheduled for publication in the spring by MacMillan/Four Winds Press Inc.         Mrs. Shulman, a native of Haskell, Tex., was in Pearl Harbor when the Japanese attacked on December 7, 1941. She joined the Navy Women's Air Raid Division and worked on the newly developed radar system tracking aircraft carriers in the Pacific throughout the war.         Besides her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Nancy Sayles of Abilene, Tex., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  December 8, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Tuesday about Fay Stanley Shulman, an advertising writer and novelist, misstated her wartime activity. She was a member of the Women's Air Raid Defense, an Army unit composed initially of civilian women who tracked aircraft in the Pacific.       
         Anne Revere, an actress who won acclaim for her screen portrayals of wise, protective motherly characters until her career was cut short by the 1950's Communist blacklist, died yesterday at her home in Locust Valley, L.I. She was 87 years old.         She died of pneumonia, Dr. Howard B. Gotlieb, the director of collections and curator of her archives at Boston University, said.         The stately, spirited character actress won a 1945 Academy Award as the mother of Elizabeth Taylor in "National Velvet." Miss Revere was also nominated for supporting Oscars for playing the mothers of Jennifer Jones in "The Song of Bernadette" (1943) and of Gregory Peck in "Gentleman's Agreement" (1947).         Miss Revere was also the understanding mother of John Garfield in "Body and Soul" (1947) and of Montgomery Clift in "A Place in the Sun" (1951). Her salt-of-the-earth motif was her straight hair carefully combed into a practical bun.         From 1934 to 1951, she was much in demand, appearing in nearly three dozen films, including "The Howards of Virginia," "Old Acquaintance," "The Keys of the Kingdom," "Fallen Angel," "Dragonwyck" and "Forever Amber." But then she was blacklisted by the industry and barred from films for 20 years for refusing to testify about Communist links before the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         The actress voluntarily resigned from the board of the Screen Actors Guild in 1951 because she believed her silence on Capitol Hill had barred her from making further films.  Back to the Stage         "Nobody went to jail because they were Communists," she said in an interview in 1975. "They went to jail for contempt. But the awful thing about the whole bloody era was that whether you answered or didn't, cooperated or not, you were dead in the business."         Miss Revere left Hollywood to seek roles on the stage, where she had trained, and starred in regional theaters and stock and occasionally on Broadway. She won a 1960 Tony Award for portraying a rigid spinster opposite Maureen Stapleton and Jason Robards in Lillian Hellman's drama "Toys in the Attic."         Anne Revere was born in Manhattan on June 25, 1903. Her father, Clinton, was a stockbroker, and she grew up on the Upper West Side and in Westfield, N.J. She earned a Bachelor of Arts at Wellesley College in 1926 and studied at the American Laboratory School in New York City with Maria Ouspenskaya and Richard Boleslavsky.         Miss Revere honed her craft in stock and regional theaters. Her first Broadway triumph was in Lillian Hellman's first play, the 1934 drama "The Children's Hour," as one of two ill-fated teachers at a girls' school falsely accused of lesbianism. The long-running play led to other leading stage roles and her Hollywood contract.         Samuel Rosen, a stage director who was Miss Revere's husband of 49 years, died in 1984. She is survived by a sister, Winn Revere Smith, of Cross River, L.I.       
         Janet Chusmir, executive editor of The Miami Herald and a leading proponent of women's advancement to the top levels of management in American journalism, died yesterday at St. Francis Hospital in Miami. She was 60 years old.         The Herald said Ms. Chusmir suffered a brain aneurysm on Friday night, aboutan hour after returning to her home in Miami Beach after the paper's evening news conference at her office.         We have lost a great friend and a great editor," said The Herald's publisher, David Lawrence. "What a zest she had for good newspapers; what energy she had for caring, for worrying about what was right and fair for everyone."         In Ms. Chusmir's three-year tenure as executive editor, The Herald won two Pulitzer Prizes. And in November 1988, less than a year after she was appointed to the paper's top news post, The Herald introduced an enlarged and revamped Spanish-language newspaper, with a separate staff, called El Nuevo Herald. A month ago she was named Editor of the Year by the National Press Foundation, which cited her for "transforming The Herald to serve the unique multicultural population of greater Miami."         When Ms. Chusmir was named The Herald's executive editor in December 1987, about 85 percent of the newsroom executives in the country were men, according to a survey by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Of the society's 1,000 members -- the top editors of the nation's dailies -- about 80 were women. Opposed Special Position         The dearth of women in high positions was the subject of a seminar at the society's convention in 1988. And when an editor suggested that it was desirable for newspapers to create a "woman's seat" among their top editors, Ms. Chusmir denounced the idea. "The seat becomes devalued," she said, "and the function becomes devalued."         Ms. Chusmir was a feminist who understood the potency of understatement. She recently told a group of Hispanic women: "Pick your battles. It's not good to be fighting over each little thing and male chauvinistic action. Instead, fight for the important things: equal pay and equal respect. Fight smart."         At the same time, she was fond of telling female executives not to forsake their ability to nurture. "I always remind myself that I can't hug a newspaper," she said.         Janet Zoll was born in Boston and earned a journalism degree from Boston University in 1949. A week after graduation she married the editor of her college newspaper, Leonard Chusmir, and soon became a mother and homemaker.         It was not until after moving to Miami Beach with her two school-age children in 1963 that Ms. Chusmir took a job at the Miami Beach Daily Sun, which no longer operates, writing articles at a flat rate of $2.50 each. She was soon given a full-time position. Five Years in Colorado         In 1968, The Herald hired her as a general assignment reporter, and, soon afterward, she was writing a column and receiving awards for her feature writing. In the early 1970's, Ms. Chusmir was named editor of The Herald section News For and About Women, which in her tenure was renamed Living Today. By 1977, she had been promoted to assistant managing editor for features.         Then, in 1982, Knight-Ridder Newspapers, the Herald's corporate parent, appointed her president and publisher of The Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo., making her the first female chief executive of one of the organization's newspapers. Five years later, she returned to The Herald as executive editor.         Last year, in an occasional column she wrote, "View From the Newsroom," Ms. Chusmir offered readers a personal glance at herself. She said her favorite avocations were "baking, reading, swimming, dieting." Her favorite place was "my balcony at sunset." And of journalism, she said, "It's a sacred trust."         Besides her husband, Ms. Chusmir is survived by a son, Steven, of Fort Lauderdale; a daughter, Marsha Chusmir-Shapiro of Daytona Beach, and a grandson.       
         Helen Sachs Straus, a trustee of Teachers College of Columbia University for 44 years and an executive at her family's radio station, died in her sleep yesterday at her home in New Canaan, Conn. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Straus, born in Elberon, N.J., was the daughter of Bernard Sachs, the neurologist who was a co-discoverer of Tay-Sachs disease. She studied at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and the Ecole des Arts in Montreux, Switzerland.         In 1915 she married Nathan Straus Jr. In 1943 Mr. Straus bought WMCA radio and became its president. Mrs. Straus became vice president of the station in 1948. She also served as director of public affairs and education and children's programming.         From 1939 to 1942 Mrs. Straus was a member of the New York City Board of Higher Education. She was active throughout her life promoting education and child welfare through many organizations, including the New York Section of the Council of Jewish Women, the National Maternal Child Health Council and the National Scholarship Service Fund for Negro Students. She was on the board of Teachers College from 1938 to 1982.         She was a member of the Cosmopolitan Club in New York City and a former president of the New York City Women's Club. Until taking up residence in New Canaan 10 years ago, she lived in New York City and on her family's estate, Quarry Lake, in White Plains.         Mrs. Straus is survived by her four sons, Nathan 3d, of Pound Ridge, N.Y.; Barnard, and Irving Lehman, of New York City, and R. Peter, of Washington, D.C.; 11 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Carol D. Shryock, a trustee of Hastings Village, N.Y., died on Sunday at Montefiore Hospital. She was 49 years old and lived in Hastings.         Mrs. Shryock died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         She was serving her fifth term as a trustee and was involved in two village projects: the development of the Newington Cropsey Museum and the acquisition of Draper Park. She was a member of the St. Matthew's Church Group of the Homeless Consortium and of the Hastings League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Shryock had been public relations director for Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown from 1989 until October of this year. From 1983 to 1989, she was public-relations manager for Graham-Windham Services to Family and Children in Hastings.         She is survived by her husband, Ralph; a sister, Joan Allard of Albany, and a son, Stephen, of Hastings.
