Marian Van Tuyl, a noted dance educator, writer and performer, died of cancer at her home in San Francisco on Nov. 10. She was 80 years old.         Miss Van Tuyl was the founder and director of the dance department at Mills College in Oakland, Calif. She was associated with the school from 1938 to 1970, and returned briefly last spring to direct a production of one of her dances. She edited and published Impulse, an Annual of Contemporary Dance, from 1951 to 1970, and edited two books, ''Modern Dance Forms in Relation to the Other Arts'' and ''An Anthology of Impulse.''         In the early 1940's, Miss Van Tuyl was the director and choreographer of the Marian Van Tuyl Dancers company, with which she also performed on their extensive and acclaimed tours of the Midwest. She also made two experimentalist dance films, ''Horror Dream,'' set to a score by John Cage, and ''Clinic of Stumble.''         An energetic exponent of dance, in the San Francisco area and across the nation, Miss Van Tuyl served on the California Arts Commission through the 1970's, compiling a modern dance directory for the organization that was published in 1972. She was a founder of the Congress on Research in Dance and its newsletter.         Miss Van Tuyl, born in Wascousta , Mich., was a graduate of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor. Her first teaching job was at the University of Chicago, where she was a dance instructor and choreographer from 1928 to 1938. She studied with Martha Graham, Hanya Holm, Doris Humphrey and Louis Horst, and also trained at the Bennington School of Dance. In 1938, Miss Van Tuyl was a fellow of the Bennington Dance Festival, the forerunner of the American Dance Festival.         Miss Van Tuyl's husband, Dr. Douglas Campbell, died in 1983. She is survived by her children, Bruce, Robert and Gail; a brother, Lawrence, and three sisters, Hilda Kahle, Ruth Semple and Anna Dudley.       
        Representative Sala Burton, a California Democrat who succeeded her late husband in Congress in 1983 and carried on his liberal policies, died today of complications arising from cancer. She was 61.         Representative Sala Burton, a California Democrat who succeeded her late husband in Congress in 1983 and carried on his liberal policies, died today of complications arising from cancer. She was 61.         Tom Schulz, a nephew of Mrs. Burton, said she died at 8:22 P.M. at the George Washington University Hospital here.         ''Mrs. Burton, recently hospitalized for further treatment and recuperation from cancer surgery, experienced a sudden decline this weekend after an apparent stabilization of her illness,'' Mr. Schulz said.  Mrs. Burton underwent surgery for colon cancer surgery in August. Her last public appearance was on Dec. 9. Swearing-in Was Delayed         Mrs. Burton arrived at her Congressional office for the opening day of Congress on Jan. 6, after insisting that she would appear. However, later in the day she became ill and was forced to leave before the swearing-in ceremonies of the 100th Congress.         The House passed a resolution allowing her to be sworn-in at home, and the oath was administered Jan. 7 by the chairman of the California delegation, Don Edwards, also a Democrat.         ''She took the oath, signed all the papers, and gave me a bottle of champagne,'' Mr. Edwards said. Mrs. Burton entered the George Washington University Hospital the next day. Re-elected in 1984 and 1986         Mrs. Burton, who represented a large portion of San Francisco, was a member of the House Rules Committee. She was elected in 1983 to complete the term of her husband, Phillip, and was re-elected in 1984 and 1986.         Although Phillip Burton was one of Congress' leading liberals, his widow traced her interest in politics to her teen-age years, when she and her parents fled Poland ahead of the Nazi occupation forces.         ''I saw and felt what happened in Western Europe when the Nazis were moving,'' she once said. ''You learn that politics is everybody's business.''         Politics was her business most of the time after she met her husband in 1950 at a convention of the California Young Democrats. 'She Astounded Everybody'         Phillip Burton spent nearly two decades in Congress and championed his liberal causes with a brash style.         ''Phil was so overwhelming he would just take over when he walked into a room,'' Mr. Edwards recalled recently. ''It tended to put her in the role as a shy wife. But she was operating all the time.         ''When Phil died, she astounded everybody,'' he said. ''First, she was on the Education and Labor Committee.'' When she got on Rules, she was among the very strongest members for national Democratic Party policies. She was an advocate for poor people, education, the environment, and arms reduction. She was a pillar of strength. She didn't give an inch.'' When she returned to the House after her operation last year, Mrs. Burton was welcomed back with a speech by Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., then Speaker of the House. Democratic Party Activities         In the 1950's Mrs. Burton helped organize the California Democratic Council and served as its vice president. She was a delegate to three national Democratic Party conventions.         She also worked closely with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to end discrimination in employment and housing.         From 1972 through 1974, she was president of the Democratic Wives of the House and Senate. She was legislative chairman of the Women's National Democratic Club and its liaison to the House.         Friends said she viewed her job of representing three-quarters of San Francisco's 678,000 residents as a family legacy. After winning the seat, she moved into offices at a Federal building in San Francisco that had been renamed for her husband.         REPRESENTATIVE SALA BURTON, 61

        Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Mrs. Green, a Democrat, started out as a schoolteacher and went on to serve 10 years in Congress.         After defeating Tom McCall, who later became Governor of Oregon, Mrs. Green represented the state's Third Congressional District from 1954 to 1974. She rose to the second-highest position on the House Education and Labor Committee and served as chairwoman of its Subcommittee on Higher Education. In that capacity, she pushed for passage of legislation creating the first Federal scholarships for college undergraduates.         Senator Mark O. Hatfield, a Republican who was a friend of Mrs. Green for 40 years, said yesterday: ''She was probably the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress. On any important legislation, such as women's rights or education or dealing with minorities or poor people, she could switch people's votes on the floor through the power of her intellect and her ability to persuade. People listened because when Edith Green spoke, she spoke from the heart as well as the mind.'' Role in Anti-Poverty Legislation         In 1967, for example, Mrs. Green played a key, though behind-the-scenes, role in passage of major anti-poverty legislation proposed by President Johnson. In large part through her efforts, a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats against the bill was splintered when she drafted and lobbied for an amendment that met the demands of some of the Southerners. Despite those efforts, President Johnson and Mrs. Green did not like each other, largely because of her early opposition to the buildup of troops in Vietnam.         Mrs. Green, a native of South Dakota, went to Willamette University in Salem, Ore., in the late 1920's and, after graduating, started teaching elementary school in Salem, according to a son, James S. Green of Gresham, Ore. She became involved in politics after working with the Oregon Education Association.         She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the platform committee. At the urging of the candidate, she gave a seconding speech for the Presidential nomination of Adlai E. Stevenson. Four years later, she was asked to second the nomination of John F. Kennedy for President. At the time, she was serving as chairman of the Kennedy campaign committee in Oregon. President Kennedy later named her as a member of the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. And he also offered her the ambassadorship to Canada, but she declined. Advocate for Women's Rights         Mr. Green said his mother was a supporter of women's rights, but without stridence. ''She realized that she had to work with the men before she knocked them over,'' Mr. Green said. ''The key is to work with them, she said, and she was very good at it. I think her colleagues would testify to that.''         Mr. Hatfield said Mrs. Green ''probably had more direct personal role in writing education-related legislation than any other person.'' He also described her as ''foremost in the effort to bring about equal pay for equal work.''         And, the Senator continued: ''She also was remarkable in this business that I'm in, in that she could walk away from it, which she did at the height of her career. She did not run again when she could have been re-elected for life.'' Mrs. Green did not seek re-election in 1974.         After retiring, she became a professor of government at Warner Pacific College and in 1976 she served as co-chairwoman of the National Democrats for Gerald Ford. In 1979, she was appointed to serve on the Oregon Board of Higher Education.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Green's survivors include another son, Richard, of Annandale, Va.; two sisters, Ruth Costello of Berkeley Springs, W.Va., and Mildred Cleaveland of San Andreas, Calif.; and four grandchildren. week, but details were not complete yesterday.         EX-REP. EDITH GREEN, 77, IS DEAD       
        Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Judge Polier retired from the bench in 1973 after 38 years in the Family Court, which was known as Domestic Relations Court when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed her to it in 1935.         The daughter of a civil libertarian, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, she was the first woman to hold a judicial office above magistrate in the state.         As a judge, she fought strenuously for an improved Family Court and for better care for the children, especially from poor families, who came before it. She also helped establish a mental-health unit in the court. Children's Rights Advocate         After retiring, she continued her battle for children's rights as a leader of several organizations. She was the director of the juvenile justice division of the Children's Defense Fund, the president of the Marion E. Kenworthy-Sarah H. Swift Foundation and a director of the Tappanz Foundation.         Judge Polier's counsel was sought by other cities and states in developing court services for children and families and she provided similar help to other countries.         She wrote numerous articles and books about the legal and psychiatric problems of dealing with children and families.         During World War II, Judge Polier served as counsel to Eleanor Roosevelt in the Office of Civil Defense in Washington. With Mrs. Roosevelt and others, she helped found the nonsectarian Wiltwyck School for disturbed delinquent children in New York City. Fired for 'Agitating' Workers         Judge Polier was born in Portland, Ore., and her desire to correct social ills showed up early in life. While a sophomore at Radcliffe College, she lived at a settlement house in Boston for underprivileged children. She had also attended Bryn Mawr College.         After transferring to and graduating from Barnard College, she got a job with a woolens mill in Passaic, N.J., from which she was fired for what she later described as ''agitating'' workers who had been forbidden by management to organize.         She studied labor relations in Geneva for a year, then decided to become a lawyer on the advice of her father. He persuaded her to study law, she said years later, ''because I had good intentions but no skills.''         In 1928, she graduated from Yale Law School, where she had married Leon A. Tulin, a professor. He died in 1932. Active in Adoption Issues         After Yale, she served on a state committee to study workers' compensation laws and was an assistant corporation counsel of New York City before she was named a judge.         She was for many years the president of Louise Wise Services, an adoption and child-care agency founded by her mother in 1916.         Judge Polier headed an unofficial citizens commission that in 1974 looked into the alleged paddling of students, at the Jordan L. Mott Junior High School in the Bronx, by two deans. The commission called for an ombudsman, among other measures, to protect pupils against corporal punishment.         Judge Polier was a vice president of the American Jewish Congress and a member of the board, and former president, of the Field Foundation.         Her second husband, Shad Polier, died in 1976. She is survived by two sons, Stephen Wise Tulin of Larchmont, N.Y., and Jonathon Wise Polier of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Trudy Festinger of Manhattan; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
        Eleanor Woolley Fowler, a longtime peace activist and former leader in the labor movement, died Wednesday at her home in Lower Makefield, Pa., of complications of ovarian cancer. She was 79 years old.         Eleanor Woolley Fowler, a longtime peace activist and former leader in the labor movement, died Wednesday at her home in Lower Makefield, Pa., of complications of ovarian cancer. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Fowler was the membership chairwoman and assistant to the executive director of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, based in Philadelphia, from 1959 to 1972. She was the group's acting executive director in 1966. For many years, until 1985, she headed the Bucks County, Pa., branch of the League.         In 1941, Mrs. Fowler was the secretary-treasurer of the Congress of Women's Auxiliaries of the Congress of Industrial Organizations, and in 1942 was an editor of the C.I.O. News.         Mrs. Fowler, a 1927 graduate of Bryn Mawr College, studied at the London School of Economics and the Sorbonne. Her husband, Cedric, died in 1968.  She is survived by a son, John, of Newtown, Pa.; two daughters, Ann Rhoads of Lower Makefield and Jane Morse of Lawrence, Kan., and eight grandchildren.       
        Lillian Reiner, who was active in the civil rights and peace movements, died Wednesday at Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital in Syracuse after a long illness.

Lillian Reiner, who was active in the civil rights and peace movements, died Wednesday at Crouse Irving Memorial Hospital in Syracuse after a long illness. She was 86 years old and lived in Syracuse.         Mrs. Reiner, who graduated from Syracuse University at the age of 64, ran unsuccessfully for mayor, the State Legislature, Congress and other offices as a member of the Onondaga County Liberal Party. In her campaigns, she often drew attention to issues of human services and the threat of nuclear weapons.         She was a member of the National Council of Negro Women, the National Organization for Women, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the American Civil Liberties Union. She was an advocate of gay rights and belonged to a number of peace organizatons, including the Syracuse Peace Council.         Her husband, Howard L. Reiner, died in 1960.         She is survived by a son, Lawrence O., of Tuckerton, N.J.; two grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.       
        Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         She was widely known as the sharp-tongued wife of one of the nation's most influential publishers, Henry R. Luce, whose magazines included Time, Life and Sports Illustrated.         But she won fame on her own as magazine writer and editor, author of ''The Women'' and other hit plays, controversial Republican member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut, and, finally, in the Eisenhower Administration, a hardworking and often praised Ambassador to Italy.         She had enough careers to satisfy the ambitions of several women, but none tied her down for long. She was often on lists of the world's 10 most admired women, but her glamorous existence and tart tongue drew criticism, sometimes partisan, sometimes envious.         Clare Boothe was born in New York City on April 10, 1903, the daughter of William Franklin Boothe, a pit orchestra violinist and sometime businessman, and the former Anna Clara Snyder, who had been a chorus girl. The child was christened Ann Clare, but she never used the Ann. When Parents Separated         Her parents separated when Clare was 8 years old. She was brought up in genteel poverty by her mother, who still managed to take her to France for a year and send her to the Cathedral School of St. Mary in Garden City, L.I., and the Castle School at Tarrytown-on-Hudson, N.Y. In 1919, her mother married Dr. Albert Elmer Austin, a prominent physician in Greenwich, Conn. On a trip to Europe in 1920, the 18-year-old Clare met Elsa Maxwell among other social figures. ''I'll have her to one of my parties,'' Miss Maxwell said. ''Whatever happens then, she'll get a rich husband.''         That happened, but not because of a Maxwell party. Clare Boothe met her future husband in church: George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire-playboy son of a clothing manufacturer.         They married in 1923 in a wedding called ''the most important social event of the season.'' It was not to last. Mr. Brokaw, 23 years older than his bride, was a heavy drinker, according to one of his biographers, and was prone to abuse his wife. After six years of marriage she won a divorce on grounds of mental cruelty and was awarded $425,000 plus education expenses for her daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw. The Job at Vanity Fair         Declining to rest on her money, Clare Boothe importuned a society friend, Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue and Vanity Fair, for a job. After proving she was not another idle society matron whiling away her time between husbands, she did a stint writing photo captions for Vogue.         Vanity Fair's editor, Frank Crowninshield, hired her after demanding that she draw up a list of 100 ideas. She rose quickly to assistant editor and wrote satirical pieces about society that were later collected in a book, ''Stuffed Shirts.''         Her penthouse apartment on East 57th Street, Manhattan, drew the social, artistic and political types who peopled Vanity Fair's pages. She became managing editor, injecting more political material in an effort to revive the magazine. She left in 1934.         She had written three plays, none produced. She once said reading the plays of George Bernard Shaw was the impetus for her interest in the theater. Much later she met Shaw and is said to have gushed, ''Except for you, I wouldn't be here.'' Shaw supposedly replied, ''And now, let me see, dear child, what was your mother's name?''         Her first produced play, ''Abide with Me,'' in 1935, was unanimously deemed a disaster. It concerned a drunken, sadistic husband who is shot in the last act. Several critics commented on how quickly she responded to almost indiscernible cries of ''Author.'' She never went to another opening night. Sparks at First Sight of Luce         Two days after the opening, the author became the wife of Henry R. Luce, publisher of Time and Fortune. The two independent personalities had struck sparks on their first meeting, when they were seated together at a dinner party and Mr. Luce ignored her.         The next time they met, at a party at the Waldorf-Astoria, his future wife resolved to pay Mr. Luce back by asking rude questions. This time he was enthralled by her. He ordered her to accompany him to the Waldorf's lobby, where he said, ''You are the great love of my life, and some day I'm going to marry you.''         The marriage lasted, although there were rumored difficulties - perhaps inevitable in a marriage between two such strongminded personalities. She had her separate careers and Mr. Luce had his magazines - Life, the picture magazine, was reportedly her idea. The Successful Plays         Mrs. Luce returned to writing plays and with ''The Women,'' in 1936, recovered admirably from her maiden flop on Broadway. The play was an apotheosis of feminine bitchiness, concerning a devoted wife, the only sympathetic character, trying to win back her husband, who had been poached by a saleswoman. It earned her $2 million.         In 1938, Mrs. Luce was represented by ''Kiss the Boys Goodbye,'' a satire on the hoopla surrounding the search for the feminine lead in the movie of ''Gone With the Wind.'' It was a box-office success, as was her next play, ''Margin for Error,'' which purveyed a modish anti-Nazism.         With World War II, Mrs. Luce sought to involve herself on a larger stage. In February 1940, she sailed for Europe as an accredited correspondent for Life for a firsthand look at the war. One result was a book, ''Europe in the Spring.'' Dorothy Parker called it ''All Clare on the Western Front.''         In 1943 Mrs. Luce decided to run for the House of Representatives from Fairfield County, Conn. Criticism of Roosevelt         Despite her friendships with early New Dealers, she was by now a Republican and made speeches critical of the Roosevelt Administration's handling of the war effort. Riding an off-year tide of anti-Administration sentiment, she defeated a Democratic incumbent by 7,000 votes.         In her first speech in the House, she attacked a proposal by Vice President Henry A. Wallace calling for postwar freedom of the air. Mrs. Luce wrapped up the Wallace proposal in a single word, ''globaloney.'' In Congress she frequently spoke out on foreign policy as well as for racial equality in the armed forces and war production.         Despite her own brief infatuation with Communism in the 1930's, Mrs. Luce emerged as an early hardline anti-Communist (although as early as 1964 she was calling for more normal relations with China).         She won re-election in 1944, campaigning with fire but concealing sorrow. Her 19-year-old daughter was killed in an automobile accident that year. A Jesuit priest put her in touch with the Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, who was becoming known for his broadcasts. Before Sheen had talked three minutes, she demanded, ''Listen, if God is good, why did He take my daughter?''         ''In order that you might be here in the faith,'' Sheen replied. Became a Catholic         Their sessions, with Mrs. Luce arguing and Sheen explaining, resulted in her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1946. After that a friend noticed a gradual change in her: ''Twenty years ago she was like a diamond - beautiful, brilliant and cold. Now she is beautiful, brilliant and compassionate. She has become a kind and remarkably unselfish woman.''         Because of personal problems and long separations from her husband that her duties entailed, Mrs. Luce did not seek re-election in 1946. She remained politically active, in addition to writing a column for McCall's, and in 1952 she campaigned for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.         He offered her the post of Secretary of Labor, but she demurred. He then named her Ambassador to Italy, stirring controversy because of Mrs. Luce's Catholicism, her lack of diplomatic experience and because she was a woman.         But she waded into her job with customary energy and contempt for obstacles. She helped lay the diplomatic groundwork for an international conference that worked out a compromise on the status of Trieste, a dispute that threatened war between Yugoslavia and Italy. Effective Diplomacy         She made strongly anti-Communist speeches and warned of cutoffs of American aid to Italian industry: Communists dominated the labor unions. She drew fire from leftists.  Once her chauffeur misunderstood her directions and took her to the residence of President Giovanni Gronchi. Unable to back out, Mrs. Luce, whose relations with the President had been somewhat strained, took the occasion to persuade him to permit the stationing of American troops on Italian soil.         In Italy she caught a mysterious illness finally diagnosed as arsenic poisoning. The Central Intelligence Agency was called in. The cause was paint dust from her bedroom ceiling. A Controversy Over Brazil         In 1959 she was nominated Ambassador to Brazil. A determined one-man opposition to her appointment was mounted in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. Mrs. Luce was confirmed both by the committee and the Senate, but she could not resist a final jab at Morse.         ''My difficulties, of course, go back some years,'' she said, ''when Senator Morse was kicked in the head by a horse.'' (He was once kicked by a horse, but not in the head.) In the resultant furor, Eisenhower defended her while Mr. Luce publicly urged her to resign, which she did.         In 1964 she announced that she was running for the Senate in New York State as a Conservative Party candidate and supporter of Senator Barry Goldwater, whose nomination for President she had seconded at the Republican convention. Under pressure from the party's liberal wing and finally Senator Goldwater himself, she withdrew from the race on the eve of the Conservative convention. Moved to Honolulu         In later years she devoted herself to social life in Phoenix, where the Luces had a house - skindiving, doing mosaics and needlepoint, painting and writing. After Mr. Luce died in 1967, she moved to Honolulu, where she lived until 1983, when she moved into an apartment at the Watergate complex in Washington.''It's a city of human proportions,'' she said.         In recent years Mrs. Luce served on President Reagan's unpaid Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.         Of her writing she once said, ''I have been too involved with living to write much - or well - about life.'' A biographer, Alden Hatch, summed her up this way:         ''Brilliant, yet often foolish; idealistic, yet realistic to the verge of cynicism; tough as a Marine sergeant, but almost quixotically kind to unfortunates; with the mind and courage of a man and exceedingly feminine instincts; the complexities of her character are as numerous as the facets of her career. Probably the reason no one understands her completely is because she does not even understand herself.''         Mrs. Luce is survived by two stepsons, Henry Luce 3d and Peter Paul Luce. Interment will be private, A High Mass will be offered at noon Tuesday in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a memorial service Wednesday at 11 A. M. at the Church of St. Stephen Martyr in Washington.
