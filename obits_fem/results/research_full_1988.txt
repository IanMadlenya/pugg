She was 87 years old and had previously lived in         Gloria Hollister Anable, an explorer, scientist and conservationist who set a women's world record for ocean descent in a bathysphere in 1931, died of cardiac arrest Friday at the Carolton convalescent home in Fairfield, Conn., where she had lived for three years. She was 87 years old and had previously lived in Stamford.         Miss Hollister, as she was known during most of her scientific career, became a celebrity in the 1930's, a time when only a handful of women earned headlines for their feats in a man's world of discovery.         Miss Hollister was a longtime associate of Dr. William Beebe, the oceanographer. She was his chief assistant on many of his voyages of exploration in the late 20's and 30's, and she served with other expeditions of the New York Zoological Society, of which she was a fellow.         In 1936 she led an exploring party through the jungles of British Guiana to the Kaieteur Falls, five times the height of Niagara. On that trip, using a light plane, she discovered 43 waterfalls. Studied Fish on Sea Floor         Born in New York City, she graduated in 1924 from Connecticut College for Women, where she was twice chosen class president, was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was selected a member of the All-America girls' hockey team. She earned a master's degree in zoology at Columbia and worked with Dr. Alexis Carrel on cancer research at the Rockefeller Institute. A fellow institute volunteer at the time was Charles A. Lindbergh.         In 1928 she was invited to accompany Dr. Beebe as a research associate on a voyage to the waters near Bermuda, where she studied fish on the sea floor 20 feet to 40 feet down. Two years later, after another Beebe associate, Otis Barton, had built the first bathysphere, she went with them to explore deep-sea life. It was on one of these expeditions that she went down 410 feet for the women's descent record.         Though much of her exploration was beneath the ocean surface or in remote lands, she also explored the inner world of nature in the laboratory of the Zoological Society, where she worked with Dr. Beebe and other scientists. She referred to herself as a detective seeking nature's secrets.         In 1941 Miss Hollister married Anthony Anable and after World War II they moved to Stamford. In the early 50's they, with a few others, founded the Mianus River Gorge Conservation Committee, the pioneer land project of The Nature Conservancy. The gorge became the country's first natural history landmark to be registered by the Department of the Interior. The preserve, orginally 60 acres, now embraces 555 acres. Mrs. Anable was chairman emeritus of the committee at her death.         Mrs. Anable is survived by two nieces, Gloria Musselman of Lexington Park, Md., and Elizabeth Miller of Columbus, Ga.

Hazel Corbin, retired general director of the Maternity Center Association in New York City and a pioneer in maternal and infant health care, died of cardiac failure Wednesday at her home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. She was 93 years old.         Throughout her career, Miss Corbin crusaded for improved maternal and infant care through demonstration projects, research and education of professionals and childbearing families.         As early as the 1930's, she encouraged fathers to take an active part in the care of expectant mothers, setting up special classes for them at Maternity Center clinics.         Miss Corbin was a major force in establishing the Interntional Childbirth Education Association. She was also a strong proponent of nurse-midwifery, encouraging the development of university-based certification programs at Columbia University, the Johns Hopkins University, Yale University and the State University of New York-Downstate Medical Center. Studied at Brooklyn College         A native of Nova Scotia, Miss Corbin came to New York during World War I to study nursing at Brooklyn College, hoping to serve as an Army nurse. Instead, she became the first field nurse in the first Maternity Center, established by the Women's City Club in 1917 to reduce maternal and infant mortality in designated parts of the city.         When the Maternity Center Association was formally organized the next year, she continued to serve in the field and to train other nurses. In 1923 she became general director, a post she held until her retirement in 1965.         He influence went well beyond the city and the field of maternal and infant care. In 1936 she was an organizer of the Public Health Association of New York City. During World War II she was in charge of recruiting nurses for the New York chapter of the American Red Cross.         She also campaigned over the decades to raise state standards for maternal and infant care, and she was a strong advocate of midwifery by trained nurses and of natural childbirth. Martha May Eliot Award         ''When any woman has her baby naturally,'' she explained, ''she cooperates with the forces at work within her body and does the job by her own efforts, with or without assistance to help her along.''         In 1966 Miss Corbin received the Martha May Eliot Award of the American Public Health Association for ''nearly 50 years as a major influence in demonstrating improved childbirth and child-care practices to physicians, nurses and mothers.'' Two years later she was awarded the highest honor of the Maternity Center Association, its Medal for Distinguished Service.         There are no immediate survivors.

        Flora Rheta Schreiber, the author of ''Sybil,'' a best-selling book about a woman with multiple personalities, and ''Shoemaker,'' a portrait of a Philadelphia murderer, died of a heart attack yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         Flora Rheta Schreiber, the author of ''Sybil,'' a best-selling book about a woman with multiple personalities, and ''Shoemaker,'' a portrait of a Philadelphia murderer, died of a heart attack yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old.         Miss Schreiber, a professor of English and speech at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, first gained renown with ''Sybil,'' her 1973 case study chronicling the life and psychoanalysis of a woman with 16 clinically distinct personalities. The book became a best seller and was turned into a two-part NBC television movie in 1976.         Because of her studies of the psychological origins of criminality, Miss Schreiber became interested in writing about Joseph Kallinger, a shoemaker who killed three people in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. She interviewed him in jail in 1976, saying that a book about the murderer would show that ''it's even more important to prevent the development of psychosis that leads to crime than to get tough with criminals after the event.''         Like ''Sybil,'' the new book by Miss Schreiber provoked considerable controversy. After ''Shoemaker'' was published in 1983, she was sued by the family of one of Kallinger's victims under a so-called Son of Sam law in New Jersey that required that money owed to a criminal or his representatives as a result of his crimes go to the victims. A Superior Court ruled that not only the 12.5 percent promised to Mr. Kallinger but also money earned by Miss Schreiber and her publisher, Simon & Schuster, be paid to the victim's family.         Publishers called the ruling a violation of First Amendment rights of free speech, and an appellate panel reversed the decision, ruling that the law applied only to payments received by the criminal.         Before teaching at John Jay College, Miss Schreiber taught for many years at the New School for Social Research and at Adelphi College. She specialized in children's speech and wrote a 1956 manual for parents called ''Your Child's Speech.'' She was a theater critic in the 1940's and later contributed to many magazines and published several short stories.         Miss Schreiber had no immediate survivors.
