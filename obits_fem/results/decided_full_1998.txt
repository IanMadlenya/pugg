         Marilyn Costello, the principal harpist of the Philadelphia Orchestra for 46 years and a respected teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music, died on Jan. 5 at her home in Philadelphia. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, said Ann Diebold, a spokeswoman for the Curtis Institute.         Ms. Costello was born in Cleveland and began her musical studies as a pianist. She made her public debut in a concert at the Cleveland Museum of Art when she was 6, and won prizes in several competitions while a teen-ager. She decided to study the harp when she was 14, after running her hands across the instrument's strings backstage at a concert of the Cleveland Orchestra.         Her principal studies were with Carlos Salzedo, the composer and harpist, at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, and it was during her second year as a student there, in 1945, that Eugene Ormandy, the conductor, invited her to join the Philadelphia Orchestra. She was the orchestra's second harpist for about half a season, and was appointed principal harpist in 1946, a position she held until her retirement in 1992.         Ms. Costello joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute in 1962, and taught harpists who eventually took positions in many of the world's great orchestras, including the Berlin Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony and the National Symphony.         She is survived by her husband, L. Daniel Dannenbaum; a son, Daniel George Dannenbaum, and two stepdaughters, Marianne Kierstead of Merrimack, N.H., and Alison Lang of Lillooet, British Columbia.       
         Dr. Gertrude Scharff Goldhaber, a physicist who contributed to scientists' understanding of nuclear fission and the structure of atomic nuclei, died on Monday at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in Patchogue, N.Y. She was 86 and lived at Bayport on Long Island.         Dr. Goldhaber was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and retired as a senior scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.         She was credited with the discovery that spontaneous fission is associated with the emission of neutrons. She made that observation in 1942 when she was a research physicist at the University of Illinois, but it was classified top secret and not announced until after World War II.         Dr. Goldhaber added to the knowledge of the structure of the nucleus when she found regularities in nuclear excited states. She also worked in areas that included long-lived isomers (different versions of elements) and heavy ions (positively and negatively charged atoms or molecules).         In 1948, she and her husband, Dr. Maurice Goldhaber, determined that  beta rays were identical with electrons, which settled an argument among their peers.         She was elected a fellow of the American Physics Society in 1947 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1980, and to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1972.         Born in Mannheim, Germany, she earned a doctoral degree at the University of Munich in 1935 and moved to England to do research at Imperial College in London.         She did research and taught at the University of Illinois from 1939 to 1950, when she became the first woman with a Ph.D. in physics on the Brookhaven faculty.         Dr. Goldhaber founded the Brookhaven Lecture Series in 1960. She was a co-founder of Brookhaven Women in Science, which furthers the advancement of women scientists and began in 1979. She retired from Brookhaven in 1977 but returned in 1985 as a research collaborator, an association she continued until 1990.         Over the years, she was an adjunct professor at Cornell University and the Johns Hopkins University. She also was an adviser and consultant  at the National Research Council, the National Science Foundation and many other scientific bodies.         Besides her husband of 59 years, she is survived by two sons, both theoretical physicists, Dr. Alfred Goldhaber of Setauket, N.Y., and Dr. Michael Goldhaber of Oakland, Calif.; a sister, Liselotte Leoni of Nice, France, and two grandchildren.         In 1984, the Phi Beta Kappa society selected her as a Visiting Scholar, an honor that sent her to eight campuses for the year. In an interview at the time with The New York Times, she said that her path into science had been clear because she fell in love with numbers at the age of 4 and decided to study physics and mathematics as a teen-ager in Munich.         She declined to settle for the future of a high school teacher, as other  girls with similar interests might have, or a lawyer, as her father wanted, she said.         ''I said, 'I'm not interested in the law,' '' she recalled. ''I wanted to understand what the world is made of. That actually turned out to be a good thing because when the Nazis came -- I'm Jewish -- I had to leave the country, and physics was something that could be done anywhere.''       
         Martha Ellis Gellhorn, who as one of the first female war correspondents covered a dozen major conflicts in a writing career spanning more than six decades, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 89.         Ms. Gellhorn was a cocky, raspy-voiced maverick who saw herself as a champion of ordinary people trapped in conflicts created by the rich and powerful. That she was  known to many largely because of  her marriage to Ernest Hemingway, from 1940 to 1945, caused her unending irritation, especially when critics tried to find parallels between her lean writing style and that of her more celebrated husband.         ''Why should I be a footnote to somebody else's life?'' she bitterly asked in an interview, pointing out that she had written two novels before meeting Hemingway and continued writing for almost a half-century after leaving him.         As a journalist, Ms. Gellhorn had no use for the notion of objectivity. The chief point of going to cover anything, she felt, was so you could tell what you saw, contradict the lies and let the bad guys have it.         ''You go into a hospital, and it's full of wounded kids,'' she once said. ''So you write what you see and how it is. You don't say there's 37 wounded children in this hospital, but maybe there's 38 wounded children on the other side. You write what you see.''         Though best known for her groundbreaking journalism, Ms. Gellhorn was also an accomplished fiction writer, author of 5 novels, 14 novellas and 2 collections of short stories, many of which were based on people and incidents she encountered during her prodigious travels.         Fresh out of Bryn Mawr College in 1927, she began writing for The New Republic, then became a crime reporter for a local newspaper in Albany. Ms. Gellhorn got to Europe by writing a brochure for the Holland American Line and traveled throughout the continent. Later, she met Harry Hopkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's confidant, and talked her way into a job with the New Deal, wandering America and writing about the effects of the Depression on ordinary people.         She went to Spain in 1937 with nothing but a knapsack and $50, covered the conflict for Collier's Weekly and became Hemingway's lover.         ''In Barcelona, it was perfect bombing weather,'' she wrote in a typical dispatch in 1938. ''The cafes along the Ramblas were crowded. There was nothing much to drink; a sweet fizzy poison called orangeade and a horrible liquid supposed to be sherry. There was, of course, nothing to eat. Everyone was out enjoying the cold afternoon sunlight. No bombers had come over for at least two hours.''         She covered the blitz in London. On D-Day, she stowed away on a hospital ship and snuck ashore as a stretcher bearer. She got British pilots to let her ride along on night bombing raids over Germany. When the Allies liberated Dachau, she was there to write about it.         ''Behind the barbed wire and the electric fence,'' she wrote of her visit to Dachau, ''the skeletons sat in the sun and searched themselves for lice. They have no age and no faces; they all look alike and like nothing you will ever see if you are lucky.''         She covered Russia's war against Finland in 1939, trekked across China with Hemingway in 1940, and became increasingly critical of the United States, which she saw as a ''colonial power,'' eventually settling abroad for good. She covered Vietnam, Nicaraguan contras, the Arab-Israeli conflict and, at the age of 81, the United States invasion of Panama. It was only when war came to Bosnia that she gave it a pass.         ''Too old,'' she said. ''You have to be nimble for war.''         Ms. Gellhorn's war correspondence was collected in ''The Face of War'' in 1959. She always focused on ordinary foot soldiers and civilians, ignoring the generals. Her peacetime journalism was collected in ''The View From the Ground'' in 1988.         Among her novels were ''A Stricken Field'' (1940), set among refugees in Prague just before the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, and ''Liana'' (1944), about the marriage of a mulatto woman and a rich white man in the French Caribbean.         Many reviewers felt Ms. Gellhorn was even more successful as a writer of novellas, and she was highly praised for ''The Weather in Africa'' (1988), three novellas set on that continent, and ''The Novellas of Martha Gellhorn'' (1993).         Ms. Gellhorn sometimes took criticism from political conservatives, who painted her as a left-leaning dilettante whose writing was often didactic and sentimental. Others  criticized her vivid journalism as being, stylistically, too much like fiction and her terse fiction as being, stylistically, too much like journalism.         But her longevity and the compelling pull of her life story overrode such criticisms. A heroine to generations of young women correspondents for her fight to get equal treatment and a place on the front lines with male colleagues, she was also a romantic figure for her wartime relationship with one of the century's most famous writers and her subsequent rejection of him.         Ms. Gellhorn's father was a doctor in St. Louis with progressive notions and her mother, whom she adored, was a suffragist and social reformer who sometimes took her daughter  with her to rallies and protests.         Her father pulled her out of a convent school when he discovered the nuns were teaching female anatomy with a textbook that had its pictures covered and transferred the girl to a progressive coeducational school of which her mother was a co-founder.  Later, at Bryn Mawr, Ms. Gellhorn changed her major from English to French, which became useful for her  journalistic work in Europe. In 1934, she was among a group of American students invited to tour Nazi Germany, and she never forgot her first encounter with Fascism. When she returned to the United States and was working for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, she befriended Eleanor Roosevelt and spent some time, as the First Lady's guest, at the White House. She also wrote a collection of novellas about it, ''The Trouble I've Seen'' (1936).         Her first marriage, in 1933 to Bertrand de Jouvenel, a French pacifist who was the son-in-law of the novelist Colette, ended in divorce.         In 1936, she wandered into a bar in Key West, Fla., and met Hemingway. They drank, became friends and, the next year, when she showed up in Madrid, she picked up again with Hemingway and other war correspondents. She married the author in 1940, becoming his third wife.         They traveled and worked together, living between conflicts at a villa in Cuba. In 1945, Ms. Gellhorn left Hemingway, walking out after an argument at London's Dorchester Hotel. She was the only one of Hemingway's wives to leave him, and he never forgave her. ''His hatred of her was a terrible thing to see,'' one Hemingway biographer noted. She left, she said, because he was jealous and bullying.         Ms. Gellhorn's third marriage, to T. S. Matthews, an editor at Time magazine, also ended in divorce. She said she just found married life too boring.         After World War II, Ms. Gellhorn adopted a son in Italy and raised him, largely on her own, in Mexico and other countries, where she supported herself with a string of articles for women's magazines.         She is survived by her son, George Alexander Gellhorn of London, and a brother, Alfred Gellhorn of New York.         Ms. Gellhorn had decided that she could no longer live in the United States, and moved from Cuba to Italy to Mexico to Kenya until finally settling in Britain, where she spent her  last 15 years shuttling between a small cottage in Wales, an apartment in London and the world's trouble spots. Her South Kensington apartment became a kind of salon for writers and foreign correspondents.         Bill Buford, the fiction editor at The New Yorker who was previously the editor of Granta, an English literary magazine, wrote about Ms. Gellhorn and her work: ''Reading Martha Gellhorn for the first time is a staggering experience. She is not a travel writer or a journalist or a novelist. She is all of these, and one of the most eloquent witnesses of the 20th century.''         She also wrote a highly regarded travel book in 1979, ''Travels With Myself and Another,'' that was an often humorous recounting of some of her more uncomfortable jaunts to remote corners of the globe, some  with Hemingway, whom she referred to only as Unwilling Companion.         Her first love continued to be a crusading brand of nonfiction. ''Journalism is education for me,'' she wrote. ''Writing is payment for the chance to look and learn.''         She wrote on an old, battered typewriter and had to quit in 1992 when a cataract operation left her with diminished eyesight. She could no longer see the keys and felt she was too old to learn how to dictate.         But she never lost her bite. She chain-smoked, drank and ate what she pleased. ''It bores me, all that health stuff,'' she said. She told one woman who came to interview her late in life that she had to stop. ''This conversation is so boring I think I'm going to faint,'' she said.         Ms. Gellhorn had little use for most war reporting after the Vietnam War, saying that the press' role in ending that conflict had taught military leaders a lesson.         ''They realized the power of the press and have been controlling it ever since,'' she said. ''Look at the Gulf War. If you wanted to go out and say to a soldier, 'How is it, kid?,' you had to bring a minder so the kid says nothing.         ''It seems to me that they feed war reporters at these ridiculous briefings in the ballroom of hotels miles from anywhere.'' The public, she said, needs to realize that it is not getting the full story.         Looking back on a life that was colorful enough for any novel or reportage, Ms. Gellhorn once confessed: ''I'm overprivileged. I've had a wonderful life. I didn't deserve it but I've had it.''       
         Chessy Rayner, a decorator, fashion icon, editor and author of ''New York: Trends and Traditions,'' a recently published book about significant Manhattan interiors, died on Thursday night at Sloan-Kettering Medical Center in New York. She was 66.         Mica Ertegun, her partner in the design company MAC II, said that Mrs. Rayner died of lung cancer.         Rail-thin, exotically featured and crowned with a lion's mane of hair that gave her the look of a space-age Nefertiti, Chesbrough (Chessy) Lewis Hall was born in 1931 in Perrysburg, Ohio, into a privileged world where little was expected of a young woman except a fairy tale debut, a comfortable marriage and an entry in the Social Register.         The only child of Richard Hall and Chesbrough Lewis, a cafe society beauty famously photographed by Horst and Avedon, she dutifully followed her social destiny: finishing school, Briarcliff Junior College and candle-lighted wedding at St. Thomas Protestant Episcopal Church in Manhattan, in 1952, to William P. Rayner, a stockbroker who later became an executive at Conde Nast Publications.         The Rayners were celebrated in Vogue as ''a fast-paced, superattractive couple,'' and rare was the week when her haunting face and couture-clad frame did not appear in Women's Wear Daily.         Her star quotient increased exponentially in 1963, after her mother remarried, becoming the wife of Iva S. V. Patcevitch, the chairman of Conde Nast. For the rest of her life, she was one of the best-dressed and most-photographed fixtures of the Manhattan social scene.         But rather than idling indefinitely in the social spotlight, Mrs. Rayner  went to work for Ladies Home Journal, moved to Glamour, and then became a fashion editor at Vogue from 1956 to 1964.         By the mid-1960's, William Rayner said, ''The bubble was off the champagne.'' Bored with the business of fashion and chafing under her dictatorial boss, Diana Vreeland, Mrs. Rayner left Vogue and went in search of what William Rayner  called ''less ephemeral, more creative'' work. The couple were divorced in 1989.         She is survived by her mother, Chesbrough Patcevitch; a half-brother, Charles Minot Amory 3d, and a nephew, Charles Minot Amory 4th, all of Palm Beach, Fla.         She and Mica Ertegun, the wife of Ahmet Ertegun, the president of Atlantic Records, toyed with opening a restaurant. Though accomplished cooks -- Mrs. Rayner wrote three cookbooks -- friends decided that their individual talents, Mrs. Rayner's sense of color and Mrs. Ertegun's architectural eye, would offer more long-term opportunities.  MAC II -- the initials stood for Mica and Chessy -- was founded in 1967. For several years, its office was a large closet in the Erteguns' house on the Upper East Side.         Though House and Garden hailed the company for its ''consistently clean and crisp adaptations of shifting modes,'' initially, fellow designers looked upon the two young stylish women with disdain. Sister Parish, the white-gloved martinet of American decorating, dismissed them with chilling politesse: ''Chessy is a nice girl. And Mica does not have to work.'' Everybody else called them ''the girls.'' As Mrs. Rayner wryly told Vogue soon after MAC II opened, ''You can see how much dignity we command.''         Their first published project was a bedroom for the 9-year-old daughter of a friend, with tall bookcases made of bamboo poles and topped with burnt-orange felt valances. Soon, however, they became a force to be reckoned with, and by the early 1980's had amassed a portfolio of residential and commercial projects for boldface celebrities like the artist Kenneth Noland, the television producer Douglas Cramer and the fashion designer Bill Blass. Marian McEvoy, the editor of Elle Decor magazine, said that what distinguished their projects was ''pragmatic glamour.''         ''Chessy was a decorator, not a re-decorator,'' said Arnold Scaasi, the fashion designer. ''One of the reasons that I chose her was because she told me I could keep all of my old furniture.''         MAC II's spare, uncluttered rooms are known for luxurious but simple finishes, comfortable seating and art that is part of the space, not a dominant element. In one New York living room, moody paintings by Manet and Van Dongen seemed to be emerging from the surface of the gold lacquered walls as from the bottom of a pond.         But despite her professional eminence, Mrs. Rayner, who enjoyed discovering beauty in unlikely places and at underwhelming prices, did not shy from projects that her equally celebrated competition might consider beneath their dignity.         To furnish a landmark house designed by the architect Stanford White, she and Mrs. Ertegun cheerfully bought everything at Sears. For another project, it was all department-store furniture and Herculon fabrics.         In the pages of Elle Decor, where she was the special projects editor from 1992 until her death, Mrs. Rayner was forever exhorting readers to delight more in $2 water glasses than in $2 million chandeliers. Her home on St. Martin, the Caribbean island, will be featured in the May issue of Elle Decor.         ''Not everything has to be refined,'' she once said to a reporter who visited her country house in Southampton. ''That's too easy and too boring. I like amusing things, funny things, offbeat things. In fact, if anything, I wish my taste were even more offbeat.''       
         Dr. Mary Catherine Raugust Howell, a pediatrician who championed medical careers and better health care for women and who was the first woman to become an associate dean at Harvard Medical School, died yesterday at her home in Watertown, Mass. She was 65.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Dr. Howell attracted the attention of a male-dominated establishment in 1973 with an ironically titled critique of the status quo, ''Why Would a Girl Go into Medicine? Medical Education in the United States: A Guide for Women'' (Feminist Press). Since Dr. Howell was a Harvard associate dean at the time, she decided to publish it under the pen name Margaret A. Campbell.         Her study of discrimination against women in medical schools, she declared in her foreword, was written ''to inform and encourage women medical students of the past, present and future and to promote radical change in medical education and in the care of patients.''         While quotas were not acknowledged in the admissions offices of medical schools, she wrote, practice suggested otherwise. A ''man doctor, woman nurse'' mentality reigned, she said, and with it the attitude that it was imprudent to waste expensive medical school training on a woman if she was unlikely to practice the profession because of marriage and  motherhood.         Dr. Howell acknowledged authorship of the book a few years later.  Her facts and figures were used as  ammunition by many groups pressing to gain a fairer role for women in the medical field. The prospects of women in medicine were eventually enhanced by Federal legislation against sex discrimination.         Dr. Howell was also active in the women's health movement. She was  a founding member of the National Women's Health Network, which was formed in the 1970's to lobby for better health care for women.         ''By 1975,'' said Cynthia Pearson, the network's executive director, ''there were over 2,000 community-based women's health groups that either provided direct services and education and an alternative to traditional male-dominated medical care or were engaged in efforts to change the system. Mary helped organize the first national women's health conference, which brought individual women and representatives of grass-roots women's health groups to the Harvard campus.''         Dr. Howell also contributed to Working Mother magazine and to ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' from the Boston Women's Book Collective, whose 25th anniversary update was published by Touchstone in 1996.         Mary Catherine Raugust was born on Sept. 2, 1932, in Grand Forks, N. D., the daughter of a businessman and a former public-school teacher. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1954, studied linguistics and originally wanted to become a musician. She married Robert Jordan of Weston, Conn., and had a son, Nicholas, but the marriage failed. She then decided to become a pediatrician.         ''She started to think she wanted to care for kids and went into pre-med,'' said Samuel Howell, her son by a second marriage. ''She was always very concerned about children and the institutional way in which medicine treats them. She fought against that all her life, trying to de-institutionalize medicine.''         In interviews later in her life, Dr. Howell told of the slights, condescension, jokes and outright hostility she endured as a medical student and intern from school administrators, faculty members and male students. Even female patients often feared that a female doctor was inherently inferior, Dr. Howell said.         But, persisting, she earned a Ph.D. in developmental psychology and an M.D. at the University of Minnesota in 1962; she earned a doctor of laws degree at Harvard University in 1991.         Dr. Howell trained in pediatrics, psychotherapy, bioethics and geriatrics at various institutions as she pursued her career as a practicing doctor and educator, starting as an instructor in child development at Minnesota in 1962. She joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School as an instructor in pediatrics in 1969, rising to become an assistant professor of pediatrics and chief of the behavior unit in the Children's Service of the Massachusetts General Hospital.         Dr. Howell was appointed associate dean for student affairs in 1972, becoming the highest-ranking woman at the medical school at the time, and served until 1975. She viewed her appointment as a kind of tokenism.         ''Prior to my appointment,'' she said in an interview in 1979, ''a committee of students and faculty had asserted the need for a woman administrator, and Harvard got tremendous mileage out of my appointment. Student affairs are traditionally places where your job is to keep students quiet and out of everyone's hair. The administration expected us to act as student pacifiers rather than student advocates.''         Shortly after her appointment, Dr. Howell sent out questionnaires to female medical students throughout  the country, asking them about their status and attitudes toward them. Their responses reminded her of her own painful journey to become a doctor, she said, and she decided to use them as the basis for what became her book for Feminist Press.         After leaving Harvard in 1975, she had a pediatric practice in York, Me.,  for a year. Based on her experiences there, she wrote another book, ''Healing at Home: A Guide to Health Care for Children'' (Beacon Press, 1978) She returned to the Boston area to practice pediatrics and psychotherapy.         From 1992 to 1994, she was a member of the Division of Medical Ethics at Harvard Medical School.         Dr. Howell's second marriage, to Dr. A. Ervin Howell of Fairmont, Minn., ended in divorce.         In addition to her sons Nicholas Jordan, of Weston, Conn., and Samuel Howell, of Manhattan, she is survived by three other sons, Aaron Howell, of Medford, Mass., Eli Howell, of Eugene, Ore., and Ned Raugust, of Concord, Mass.; two daughters, Sarah Howell, of Framingham, Mass., and Eve Howell, of Boston; a brother, Tony Raugust of Minneapolis, and one granddaughter.       
         Celestine Tate Harrington, a quadriplegic street musician whose buoyant personality and unremitting chutzpah brought astounded smiles to everyone who watched her play the keyboard with her lips and tongue on Atlantic City's Boardwalk, died on Feb. 25 at the Atlantic City Medical Center. She was 42.         She died of complications resulting from critical injuries she suffered in a traffic accident on Feb. 19.         Mrs. Harrington was born with a congenital joint condition that eroded the connective tissue in her arms and legs, leaving them immobile stubs, but she never seemed to consider herself disabled. Her daily street performances in front of Bally's Park Place Casino and Caesar's Palace, where she performed ''Amazing Grace'' and ''Stormy Weather'' on an electric synthesizer, were studies not only in the art of music, but also in the art human self-salvation.         Mrs. Harrington was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, and her father abandoned her when she was 6 years old, family members and a friend said.         Raised by her maternal grandparents, a construction worker and a registered nurse, she eventually became a parent herself. In 1974, in downtown Philadelphia, she met John Smith, a nursing home aide who courted her while she lived at the Moss Rehabilitation Clinic in Philadelphia. She bore him a daughter, Nia, in 1975, but before the couple could marry, Mr. Smith died.         The death led the courts to seek custody of Nia. Mrs. Harrington won the right to raise her child in 1976 by demonstrating to a dumbstruck judge what she could manage: she changed the baby's diaper with her teeth.         Three years later, she met a construction worker, Stanford Williams. In 1979, they, too, had a daughter, Coronda, but never married.         Mrs. Harrington learned to play the keyboard at Philadelphia's Settlement Music School. Soon afterward, she decided to take her newfound skill downtown, where she played for change on the sidewalk in front of Wanamaker's department store. But Atlantic City -- bustling with tourists and extra change -- beckoned. She arrived on the Boardwalk in 1984, and she eventually moved into a condominium in Atlantic City purchased with the proceeds from her busking.         She often boasted that as much as $100,000 a year was dropped into her plastic bucket, though friends and relatives gently dispute that claim.         Though Mrs. Harrington eventually started a tiny enterprise designing business cards, her main interest was her music, and her repertoire of solemn ballads like ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow,'' and patriotic hymns like ''America the Beautiful,'' quickly made her a redemptive presence in a gambling town. They also won her a following among the Boardwalk's casual strollers.         By 1989, Mrs. Harrington was a beloved presence, partly because of the remarkable figure she cut: a 4-foot, 10-inch tall, 190-pound woman moving swiftly, lying on her stomach, head up, , through the city streets on a motorized gurney that she guided with a steering device worked by her chin. But she was also known for the inspirational message she spread as a guest on national talk shows or to people she met on the Boardwalk with whom she formed close relationships.         Among them was her husband, Roy Harrington, a casino maintenance man who came along in 1990. In the next year, the couple married and adopted Charles Graves, the son of a former boyfriend.         In addition to her husband and three children, Mrs. Harrington is survived by two sisters, Agnes Tate-Sanders and Tamogene Tate, both of Philadelphia, and a brother, Jay-Cee Tate of North Carolina.         Another person that Mrs. Harrington befriended was Camille LeClair, co-owner of a McDonald's restaurant in Atlantic City who hired her last year to take phone deliveries.         A poignant memory of Mrs. Harrington was on her mind last week when word came that she had died. On one occasion when Mrs. Harrington was in her house, Mrs. LeClair said: ''I hopped in the shower and when I came back I said to Celestine, 'Why does God allow me to jump in and out of the shower in 10 minutes, but you have to struggle so much?'  Well, Celestine just looked at me and said, 'That's why I'm here. To keep reminding you to count your blessings every day.' ''       
         Laurie Beechman, the throbbing-voiced singer and actress who played Grizabella in the Broadway musical ''Cats'' for more than five years, died on Sunday at her home in White Plains, N.Y. She was 44.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, said her agent and friend, Jim Wilhelm.         An emotive belter in the tradition of Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand, both of whom were her girlhood idols, Ms. Beechman brought a waifish pathos and a piercing vocal power to her character's signature song, ''Memory.''         Whether on Broadway, on a concert stage or in a cabaret, Ms. Beechman conveyed a strong involvement with her material, delivering the climaxes of big ballads with a full-throated, sobbing intensity.         Ms. Beechman was born in Philadelphia, attended New York University and made her Broadway debut in 1977 in the ensemble of ''Annie.''         Venturing into the pop arena, she  made an album, ''Laurie and the Sighs'' (Atlantic), that presented her as a rock belter in the mode of Pat Benatar. When the album sold poorly, she decided to stick to the worlds of theater and cabaret and returned to Broadway as the narrator in ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'' Her performance in that show won her Tony and Drama Desk nominations for best featured actress in a musical.         In 1983 she took the role of Grizabella in the national touring company of ''Cats'' with the proviso that she step into the part on Broadway when Betty Buckley departed. The chance came four months later.         In the late 1980's and 90's, Ms. Beechman became a cabaret and concert performer who often blended popular standards and theater songs with light rock-and-roll. She also recorded four more albums.         Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 1989. Despite her illness, she joined the national touring company of ''Les Miserables'' in the role of Fantine, performing in the touring production of ''The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Sunset Edition,'' and singing ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' at President Clinton's 1997 inaugural gala. Last spring she rejoined ''Cats'' in time to be playing Grizabella when the show surpassed ''A Chorus Line'' as Broadway's longest-running hit.         She is survived by her husband, Neil Mazzella; her parents, Dr. Nathan and Dolly Beechman Schnall of Philadelphia, and two sisters, Jane Segal and Claudia Cohen, both of Philadelphia. A funeral will be held tomorrow at 11 A.M. at J.  Levine and Sons Memorial Chapel, 7112 North Broad Street, Philadelphia.         Ms. Beechman became an advocate and role model for people with cancer. ''The perception people have of cancer,'' she told The New York Times, ''is that you're cured or you die, and that's not necessarily how it works. It can be more like diabetes, a part of life.''       
         Ilse Bing, one of the few surviving members of the fabled group of avant-garde artists who gathered in Paris in the early 1930's and produced brilliantly unorthodox and inventive photography, died Tuesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 98 and lived on the Upper West Side.         Susan Arthur Whitson, director of the Edwynn Houk Gallery, which represents her work, said that the gallery had hoped that Ms. Bing would attend the March 26 opening of a retrospective of her work titled ''Ilse Bing: Vision of a Century.'' She would have been 99 on March 23.         Born into an affluent bourgeois family in Frankfurt, Ms. Bing was trained in music and art. It was while she was pursuing a doctorate in art history and photographing buildings for her dissertation that she developed a passion for photography. In early 1929 she began to do picture essays for the weekly supplement of a Frankfurt newspaper, becoming one of the few women to work in photojournalism at the time.         She soon abandoned her studies to become an artist and decided to leave for Paris in the summer of 1929 after seeing an exhibition of photographs by the Paris-based Florence Henri, who had embraced New Photography, which was characterized by extreme close-ups, unusual angles, high and low vantage points, and the rendering of everyday objects and reflected surfaces as abstract geometric forms.         Paris in the 1920's and 30's was home to modernists like Henri, who saw photography as the medium to revolutionize visual language in everything from photojournalism and commercial advertising to fashion and book illustration. Working intuitively and with no regard for conventional composition or subject matter, these modern photographers were above all entranced by the new sensations of urban living.         The only professional photographer in Paris in the 30's to work exclusively with the Leica, Ms. Bing mastered the use of this small camera as well as darkroom techniques to show the subtleties of light and movement against the inky blacks of Paris at night. She favored the overhead shots and tilted angles of German Constructivists, but her photographs are often infused with the softer, more lyrical and humanistic qualities found in the work of many French photographers.         Like Andre Kertesz and Henri Cartier-Bresson, she caught the spare, lovely geometries in ordinary Parisian life. She photographed nighttime Paris, using available light and producing images that were studies of light and deep shadow. Accidentally in the darkroom, and independently of Man Ray, she discovered a way to solarize the negative instead of the print, giving the image black outlines created from the controlled use of light during printing. Her solarized images of street scenes, especially at night, are magical coaxings of many shades of gray out of darkness.         Ms. Bing worked for magazines like Vu, Arts et Metiers Graphiques and Le Monde Illustre. She did fashion assignments for Harper's Bazaar and Schiaparelli. Her photographs were regularly shown during the 30's at La Pleiade gallery in Paris, alongside the work of other members of the photographic avant-garde.         In 1936, she was included in the first modern photography exhibition held at the Louvre. The next year she was part of the landmark photography exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.         Ms. Bing's best-known photograph from this period is a strikingly original self-portrait. To create this fractured image, she photographed a mirrored image of herself -- one bent arm leaning against a table, a Leica on a tripod positioned in front of one eye -- with a side view of herself reflected in another mirror.         When Ms. Bing visited New York in 1936, she was offered a position on the fledgling photo magazine Life. But she turned down the offer because her future husband, Konrad Wolff, a pianist and musicologist, lived in Paris. They married in 1937. Both were German Jews and were interned briefly as enemy aliens by the Vichy Government in 1940, but both managed to get themselves freed. Later that year, they sailed for New York, where they remained for the rest of their lives. Mr. Wolff died in 1989. No immediate family members survive. A memorial service will be held at the National Arts Club at 15 Gramercy Park South on April 2 at 3 P.M.         In March 1993, Ms. Bing was awarded the first Gold Medal for photography by the National Arts Club in Manhattan. She told an interviewer from The New York Times that she had given up photography in 1959 because ''everything moves, nothing stays and I should not hold on.'' Ms. Bing next turned to poetry, creating what she called ''snapshots without a camera.'' She also made collages with old photographs and objects, and illustrated whimsical books on etymology and on numbers. And she groomed dogs for a living.         Ms. Bing was, Ms. Whitson said, ''very sharp, very funny and very active -- she took up the motorcycle when she was in her 70's.''       
         Diana Epstein, a onetime New York book editor whose prosaic need to replace some plastic (ugh!) buttons on a stylish new jacket led her down a rabbit hole of miniature wonder into an enchanted world awash in buttons, died on April 3 at Beth Israel Hospital North near her tiny town house on the Upper East Side. She was 61 and a founding proprietor of Tender Buttons, the small East 62d Street shop devoted exclusively, ecstatically, extravagantly to buttons.         Her friend and business partner, Millicent Safro, said the cause was an infection contracted during treatment for the flu.         Until that fateful day in 1964 when she set out on her lunch hour to buy some decent buttons, Ms. Epstein had been a more or less normal New York career woman, albeit one with a decided artistic flair and a vague feeling that literature might not be her true calling.         A native of New York City who was adopted by an aunt, Ms. Epstein had grown up in Chicago, graduated from the University of Chicago and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago before coming to New York, where she held a series of editing jobs and tried her hand at writing, once taking off six months to work on a novel in Greece.         For all her soaring imagination, Ms. Epstein could never have dreamed up what happened to her after she arrived at the ramshackle East 77th Street shop where she had bought buttons before and found that the proprietor had died and the store was shuttered.         Acting on what she recalled only as an inspired whim, Ms. Epstein tracked down the owner's heirs, paid them $5,000 for the entire stock of several hundred thousand buttons dating to the 1930's, and then, with no place to keep them, rented the store, and, somewhat dazed by her impetuous investment, tried to figure out what to do next.         A few weeks later, at a party at the store for an artist friend, she got the answer: One of the guests was Ms. Safro, a young antiques restorer who took one look at Ms. Epstein and the jumble of crushed and torn cartons of buttons and decided to set them straight.         It was the beginning of a remarkable partnership, and by the time Ms. Safro had helped Ms. Epstein organize the hoard of buttons the friends had backed into a business they knew nothing about.         As Ms. Epstein later recalled, the women, who had no real notion of opening a business, made their first sale when one of the store's former customers wandered in one day and bought six red buttons for a penny apiece in what may or may not have been a bargain: The women had no idea what any of their buttons were worth, but they soon made a point to find out, reading virtually everything ever written about buttons, which date to ancient Egypt but have been a collecting craze only since the Depression, and pumping experts in the field.         By the time they moved the store to its present location, at 143 East 62d Street, in 1968, they had become experts themselves.         Ms. Epstein had published the first of her three books on buttons, and, to their eventual dismay, both had become so hopelessly hooked on buttons that selling a treasured set would make them cry.         Business is business, however, and they made the best of it, purchasing a series of important collections, making two extensive buying trips abroad each year and making their store such a valuable resource it was a wonder how such celebrity regulars as Joan Bennett, Candice Bergen, Bill Blass, Oleg Cassini, Julie Christie, Claudette Colbert, Catherine Deneuve, Greta Garbo, Rose Kennedy, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Ali MacGraw, Paloma Picasso, Sidney Poitier, Isabella Rossellini, Susan Sarandon, Brooke Shields, Carly Simon, William Styron and Tom Wolfe could have got by without them, not to mention Kermit the Frog.         (The two women, who delighted in tracking down Muppet buttons in the precise shade of Kermit green, also supplied the playing card buttons for Jack Nicholson's jacket as the Joker in ''Batman.'')         Although Ms. Epstein believed that the quality of the store's vast selection spurred designers to upgrade their buttons, it has not been unusual for a customer to go straight from, say, Bergdorf's to Tender Buttons to buy an even better set of buttons for a newly purchased dress or suit.         In a store with thousands of different blazer button designs and tens of thousands of unique sets, Ms. Epstein, who saw buttons as art, catered to both collectors and customers seeking a single replacement for a missing shirt button or a striking set for a new garment.         She was so familiar with her stock that she would go unerringly to the box holding the exact match for a customer's missing button on a pair of Brooks Brothers pajamas.         Ms. Epstein's personal credo was that buttons should never speak louder than the dress or jacket they adorn, no cinch, to be sure, in a store much of whose inventory fairly shouts, but then her own clothes tended to be handmade to her own design from fine fabrics purchased abroad.         Operating a store that is as much museum as emporium, its walls lined floor to ceiling with small gray boxes holding more than a million ancient, antique and modern buttons in a profusion of materials, shapes and sizes with designs ranging from miniature fine art to cut-down kitsch, seemed to stimulate Ms. Epstein's artistic talents.         A large woman of surprising grace, she developed an interest in all things small, and became famous among her friends for her miniature watercolor collages, which led to a line of button-adorned greeting cards (''Berry Christmas'').         She was also known for her ''little'' dinners, generally served on small plates on children's furniture, but once, for a visiting niece who really wasn't very hungry, she served up breakfast on doll house china.         Ms. Epstein, who is survived by two brothers, Mel and Sheldon Green, and a sister, Barbara Levin, all of Chicago, where Tender Buttons also has a store, made sure the business would survive her. Ms. Safro, her heir, said it would continue.       
         P. W. Manchester, a Britain-born critic with wide-ranging interests who edited important dance magazines in London and New York, co-edited a dance encyclopedia and taught dance history, died on Monday at Deaconess Hospital in Cincinnati. She was 91 and lived in Clifton, Ohio.         The cause was complications of a stroke, said Janet Light, a friend.         Miss Manchester disliked and never used her given name, Phyllis Winifred. She signed her reviews with her first initials and was known to friends and colleagues as Bill. Dance was her passion and she witnessed the final days of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, the birth of the company that became the Royal Ballet and the formative years of the New York City Ballet.         She could also speak authoritatively on subjects like world literature, the British royal family and baseball, a sport she became devoted to after moving to New York in 1951. She even occasionally served as a radio sports commentator in Cincinnati, discussing baseball games in a refined British accent.         Miss Manchester came to the United States to work as associate editor and principal critic for Dance News, a monthly magazine, and, with its founder, Anatole Chujoy, co-edited  The Dance Encyclopedia, published in 1967. She also wrote dance criticism for The Christian Science Monitor during the 1960's.         Miss Manchester was born in London and worked there as a dance critic for Theater World magazine from 1941 to 1943.         She attracted widespread attention in 1942 with ''Vic-Wells: A Ballet Progress,'' a book appraising the company now known as the Royal Ballet. The work was considered so shrewd that Miss Manchester was often asked if she had personal connections to the company's staff. But at the time, she had none. That same year, however, she became directly involved with another troupe by serving as secretary to Marie Rambert, director of the Ballet Rambert.         Miss Manchester resigned in 1946 to found a monthly magazine called Ballet Today. Its success and her succinct prose led Mr. Chujoy to invite her to Dance News. When Mr. Chujoy died in 1969, he willed her his magazine. But she decided to sell it and accept an offer to teach at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, remaining there until she retired in 1993.         She also taught at the University of Utah and the North Carolina School of the Arts and was an adjudicator, arranging programs for regional ballet festivals.         Miss Manchester took an active part in Cincinnati civic life and for several years was host of a weekly radio dance program there. In 1975, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts enabled her to prepare a series of radio programs on dance history. She received the Dance Magazine Award in 1988.         She is survived by nieces and nephews in Britain and the United States.       
         Dr. Emily Mudd, a onetime college dropout who trained to be a landscape architect before the trajectory of her life and her own inner fire led her to become a pioneering marriage and family counselor, died on Saturday at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 99 and widely regarded as a giant of the field she helped create.         At a time when more than 25,000 American marriage counselors treat some 2 million troubled marriages a year, it might seem a shade surprising that in 1933, when Mrs. Mudd helped form the Philadelphia Marriage Council, the field was so new there were only two other such organizations in the country.         There were also no established training programs for marriage counselors, which might help explain why her fellow organizers asked Mrs. Mudd to run the Philadelphia program even though she did not have an academic degree.         But she did have a few other credentials. For one thing, she and her husband, Stuart, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, had helped start Pennsylvania's first birth control clinic six years earlier, and her experiences there dealing with often overburdened and sometimes abused wives had led her to see the need for broader family counseling.         Then, too, Mrs. Mudd was the only wife and mother among the academics and social work specialists who met at the Mudds' home to plan the marriage council.         The men were so impressed with their hostess's drive, insights, intuition and commitment that after an elaborate search for a qualified professional, they decided she would be the best person to run the council. It certainly would have been hard to find anyone more dedicated to social change and human improvement.         As a student at Vassar when the United States entered World War I, she was so determined to do her part for the cause that she helped form a Vassar unit of the women's Land Army, established to have women work the fields in place of mobilized farmers.         Her own role in that unit and as a Vassar student came to an end when she drank some fetid water, developed typhoid fever and was advised to avoid stuffy classrooms and seek a career in the fresh air. Accordingly, she studied landscape architecture at a school in Groton, Mass., but before she could begin a career she was diverted by romance.         After her marriage in 1922, Mrs. Mudd spent a decade as her husband's unpaid laboratory assistant, first at Harvard, later at the Rockefeller Institute in New York and then at the Henry Phipps Institute in Philadelphia, winning credit as co-author of 14 of his scientific papers.         After being asked to run the new Philadelphia Marriage Council, she returned to college. Working part time until she obtained a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, Mrs. Mudd, who eventually received her doctorate there, became the council's full-time executive director in 1936 and held the post until her retirement in 1967.         Along the way she helped lay the groundwork for virtually every aspect of professional marriage and family counseling. She formed one of the first counselor training programs, developed the first program to measure counselor effectiveness, wrote several textbooks and lectured widely here and abroad.         Only the third woman to be named to the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school, Dr. Mudd, who later became the first woman to become a full professor there, taught the first course at an American medical school dealing with sexuality, a speciality that led her to help edit Alfred Kinsey's book on female sexuality and to work closely with the Masters and Johnson clinic in St. Louis, to which she contributed thousands of case histories from her own practice.         After her retirement from the Philadelphia Marriage Council, now affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Mudd, who remarried after her first husband's death in 1975, continued to see patients well into her 80's. She also found time to pursue her old landscaping speciality by developing elaborate gardens at her suburban home.         She is survived by two sons, John, of Cambridge, Mass., and Harvey, of Bethesda, Md.; two daughters, Margaret, of Cold Spring, N.Y., and Emily Mitchell of Concord, Mass.; 10 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Alice Faye, one of the few movie stars to walk away from stardom at the peak of her career, died yesterday at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was in her mid-80's.         The cause was cancer, according to her publicity company, Jewel Baxter, which said she had had two stomach tumors removed last month.         Ms. Faye's warm, husky contralto and demure sexuality in ''Tin Pan Alley,'' ''Hello, Frisco, Hello'' and ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' made her one of Hollywood's top 10 moneymaking stars in 1938 and 1939. Under contract to 20th Century Fox for a little over a decade, during which she made 32 movies, Ms. Faye walked out in 1945 after Darryl Zanuck, the studio's leader, chopped up her scenes in ''Fallen Angel'' to highlight the performance of a younger Fox star, Linda Darnell.         Ms. Faye handed the keys to her dressing room to the studio gate guard and drove off the lot.         ''When I stopped making pictures,'' she told an interviewer in 1987, ''it didn't bother me because there were so many things I hadn't done. I had never learned to run a house. I didn't know how to cook. I didn't know how to shop. So all these things filled all those gaps.''         It was that attitude of taking life as it came without shaking her fist at fate that informed many of her screen performances. She was the honest, good-hearted girl who stood by her man. And when that man did her wrong, her response was to sing a torch song and love him harder. Off screen she had an unlikely but happy marriage to the brash band leader Phil Harris, whom she married in 1941. Hollywood gossip columnists gave the marriage six months, but it lasted 54 years, until Mr. Harris's death at the age of 91 in 1995. They had lived for many years in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs.         Ms. Faye, whose original name was Alice Leppert, was the daughter of a New York City policeman and grew up in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. Although some books list her birth date as 1912, she insisted she was born in 1915 but had lied about her age when she joined the Chester Hale vaudeville troupe at 13.         After several years in the chorus,  Alice Faye, still a teen-ager, got a job on Broadway in ''George White's Scandals of 1931,'' which starred Ethel Merman, Ray Bolger and Rudy Vallee. She sang ''Mimi'' at a cast party, and Mr. Vallee hired her as a singer on his radio show. When  ''Scandals'' was made into the Fox film ''George White's Scandals of 1934,'' Ms. Faye replaced Lillian Harvey as Mr. Vallee's love interest.  Mr. Vallee's wife sued for divorce, naming Ms. Faye as his love interest off screen as well.         Fox put Ms. Faye under contract and presented her as a brassy imitation Jean Harlow in movies like ''She Learned About Sailors'' and ''King of Burlesque.'' After Mr. Zanuck's 20th Century Films merged with Fox in 1935, the studio softened her image. Jack Kroll of Newsweek once called her ''a luscious marshmallow sundae of a girl,'' and her ripe figure fit the many period movies like ''Little Old New York'' and ''In Old Chicago'' in which she sang to Don Ameche, Tyrone Power or John Payne from the stage of a saloon.         Mr. Ameche lost her to Mr. Power in ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' and ''In Old Chicago'' but won her affections in ''You Can't Have Everything,'' ''Hollywood Cavalcade,'' ''Lillian Russell'' and ''That Night in Rio.''         It was the one-two punch of ''In Old Chicago'' and ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' in 1938 that made Ms. Faye a top box-office draw. A year later she and Mr. Power were teamed for the last time in ''Rose of Washington Square,'' a fictionalization of the Nicky Arnstein-Fanny Brice story that was later the basis for the Broadway and Hollywood musical ''Funny Girl,'' which starred Barbra Streisand. Ms. Faye had been responsible for Mr. Power's stardom. In 1936, when he was only an extra, she insisted that Fox test him.         Her voice was inviting, and Irving Berlin once said he would choose Ms. Faye over any other singer to introduce his songs. In 1937, George Gershwin and Cole Porter called her the best female singer in Hollywood. In ''Rose of Washington Square,'' with tears in her eyes, Ms. Faye poured her love and faith in her no-good man into ''My Man.'' But the song with which she is most closely associated is the Academy Award-winning ballad ''You'll Never Know'' from ''Tin Pan Alley.''         An early marriage to Tony Martin, a singer, ended in divorce after three years when Ms. Faye had become a star and Mr. Martin had not succeeded in the movies. When she remarried, she said, she was determined not to let that happen again. She and Mr. Harris were the parents of two daughters by the time she walked off the Fox lot after ''Fallen Angel.''         Ms. Faye had tried to change her screen image in that film noir melodrama, as the wife whose husband wants to dump her for the character played by Ms. Darnell. When she saw how Mr. Zanuck had edited the movie, she decided it would be a failure, telling an interviewer decades later, ''I couldn't see anything coming for me but the same old dumb things.''         So she spent the next eight years raising her children and appearing with her husband on a successful Sunday evening radio program, ''The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show.''         Ms. Faye is survived by her daughters, Alice Regan and Phyllis Harris; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         In 1962 Ms. Faye returned to 20th Century Fox as Pat Boone's mother in a poorly received remake of ''State Fair.'' In 1973 she toured in a revival of ''Good News,'' and in 1976 joined other golden-era stars in cameo roles in ''Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood.''         In 1984 Ms. Faye became a spokeswoman for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, encouraging ''young elders'' to live a healthy life. In 1990, she was co-author of a book, ''Growing Older, Staying Young,'' with Dick Kleiner.         Reminiscing about her years at Fox, Ms. Faye described the studio as a kind of penitentiary.         ''So I decided to make a new life for myself,'' she said. ''A home life. I had been chauffeured to work, made up, dressed, given my meals and chauffeured back home. I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to be independent. I equated independence with seeing daylight during the week and learning how to drive a car.''         Correction:  May 11, 1998, Monday  An obituary of the actress and singer Alice Faye in some editions yesterday misidentified the source of the song ''You'll Never Know,'' which won an Academy Award in 1944. It was from the film ''Hello, Frisco, Hello,'' not ''Tin Pan Alley.'' The obituary is reprinted today on page A15 for readers who did not receive it.

But the song with which she is most closely associated is the Academy Award-winning ballad ''You'll Never Know'' from ''Hello, Frisco, Hello.''         An early marriage to Tony Martin, a singer, ended in divorce after three years when Ms. Faye had become a star and Mr. Martin had not succeeded in the movies. When she remarried, she said, she was determined not to let that happen again. She and Mr. Harris were the parents of two daughters by the time she walked off the Fox lot after ''Fallen Angel.''         Ms. Faye had tried to change her screen image in that film noir melodrama, as the wife whose husband wants to dump her for the character played by Ms. Darnell. When she saw how Mr. Zanuck had edited the movie, she decided it would be a failure, telling an interviewer decades later, ''I couldn't see anything coming for me but the same old dumb things.''         So she spent the next eight years raising her children and appearing with her husband on a successful Sunday evening radio program, ''The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show.''         Ms. Faye is survived by her daughters, Alice Regan and Phyllis Harris; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         In 1962 Ms. Faye returned to 20th Century Fox as Pat Boone's mother in a poorly received remake of ''State Fair.'' In 1973 she toured with John Payne in a revival of ''Good News,'' and in 1976 joined other golden-era stars in cameo roles in ''Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood.''         In 1984 Ms. Faye became a spokeswoman for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, encouraging ''young elders'' to live a healthy life. In 1990, she was co-author of a book, ''Growing Older, Staying Young,'' with Dick Kleiner.         Reminiscing about her years at Fox, Ms. Faye described the studio as a kind of penitentiary.         ''So I decided to make a new life for myself,'' she said. ''A home life. I had been chauffeured to work, made up, dressed, given my meals and chauffeured back home. I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to be independent. I equated independence with seeing daylight during the week and learning how to drive a car.''       
         Clara Rockmore, a musician who was trained as a violinist but became famous principally as a soloist on the theremin, an early electronic instrument, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         The theremin, invented in 1920 by Leon Theremin, produces a pure, eerie, sliding tone that has been compared to a disembodied, wordless soprano voice or an enchanted cello. In recent years, thanks in part to the 1994 film ''Theremin: An Electronic Odyssey,'' the instrument has developed a cult following, as has Ms. Rockmore, who appeared in the movie. She was also the focus of a video documentary, ''Clara Rockmore, the Greatest Theremin Virtuosa,'' released last month.         Describing Ms. Rockmore's performances, Steve Martin, the director of the theremin film, said, ''Clara is to the theremin what Andres Segovia and Jimi Hendrix combined are to the guitar.''         Ms. Rockmore was born Clara Reisenberg in Vilna (now Vilnius) in Lithuania. She showed considerable talent as a violinist before she was 4, and in 1915 she became the youngest musician ever admitted to the St. Petersburg Conservatory. Her principal teacher there was Leopold Auer, whose other students had included Mischa Elman and Jascha Heifetz.         In the mid-1920's, Ms. Rockmore moved to New York, where she resumed her studies with Auer, who had also immigrated. After a few years, however, she began to have muscular and joint problems that curtailed her career as a violinist. At around the same time, she met Theremin and decided to study his electronic instrument. She became his student and close friend; for her 18th birthday, he made her a cake that lit up and revolved whenever anyone approached. Ms. Rockmore's influence on the instrument itself included suggesting structural changes to improve its articulation.         Ms. Rockmore gave one of the first theremin concerts in the United States, in 1934. The composer Anis Fuleihan wrote a concerto for her, and she performed as a soloist with several orchestras, including the New York Philharmonic, the Philadelphia Orchestra and the Toronto Symphony.         Ms. Rockmore is survived by a sister, Anna Sherman of Manhattan.       
         Ginette Mathiot, who taught French cooking to the French with such succinct authority that her basic book of recipes sold more than five  million copies, died on June 14 at a retirement home in Paris. She was 91 and best known for her 1932 classic, ''I Know How to Cook.''         In a country whose vaunted cuisine has been largely the province of men, the title of that book, Miss Mathiot's first, has a certain ring of defiance, and no wonder.         Born in Paris in an era when women in France had far fewer career choices than they do today, Miss Mathiot, who was chastising the French cooking establishment as a sexist, male-dominated bastion long after opportunities for women improved, chafed at the restrictions from the beginning.         If she couldn't do anything else, at least she could cook, and if anybody doubted her, it wasn't the generations of French homemakers who turned her book into the bible of the French kitchen.         Raised in an austere household headed by her father, a Protestant minister, she was a brilliant student in secondary school, becoming a disciple of Simone Weil, the ascetic philosopher and mystic. But when she expressed an interest in studying medicine, she was persuaded instead to take teaching courses at the Sorbonne and eventually to specialize in the French version of home economics as a more appropriate outlet for a woman than medicine.         She rose to the top of her academic field, becoming an inspector general in the French homemaking academy before French education authorities withdraw recognition of homemaking as an academic discipline.         By her own account Miss Mathiot  garnered a total of seven marriage proposals but her father rejected each of her suitors on religious grounds (none were Protestant) and although Miss Mathiot considered rebelling, in the end, she said, she found she couldn't and bowed to her family's wishes.         After she established a life and career away from her family, the proposals kept coming, but Miss Mathiot continued to reject them, she said, though for reasons of her own.         If it was a father's stern will that forced her to become a home economics teacher, it was another man's inspired whim -- and a bit of luck -- that led her from the backwaters of education to the front burner of French cuisine.         While Miss Mathiot was still studying to be a teacher at the Paris Training School of Homemaking at the beginning of the Depression, Albin Michel, a portly French publisher, decided that a cook book emphasizing nutrition might help his ailing business, not to mention his waistline, by appealing to what he perceived as a broad public fascination with the developments of modern science, including advances in nutritional understanding.         When leading authorities on French cuisine turned him down, Mr. Michel proposed the project to the head of a local college's science department, who also turned him down but set off a chain of recommendations that finally led Mr. Michel to the 23-year-old Miss Mathiot, who said yes.         Her book, which included 2,000 recipes covering the canon of French cuisine from lobster bisque to crepe suzette, was an immediate sensation and paved the way for sequels, among them books on bread, pastry and even camping-trips cooking.         In addition to emphasizing nutrition, Miss Mathiot's books appealed to family cooks because they showed how to keep food costs down while remaining true to the spirit of French cooking.         Like ''The Joy of Cooking'' in the United States, ''I Know How to Cook'' and other Mathiot books served as primers for novice cooks, leading readers from the basics of food preparation through simple recipes to more elaborate concoctions.         A woman who presided over what she saw as a kitchen with millions of stoves, Miss Mathiot, who leaves no immediate survivors, never took anything for granted.         Anyone following a cake recipe, for example, might think the end had been reached with the instruction to remove the cake from the oven, but Miss Mathiot, mindful of the distractions of a triumphant moment, would have one more instruction: turn off the oven.       
         Mildred Elizabeth Buller Smith, who cut a singular swath through the 20th century by, among other things, picking apples and digging potatoes for the Women's Land Army in World War I, riding herd on New England milk prices for the Office of Price Administration in World War II and becoming a Connecticut television celebrity as a consumer price specialist, died on Aug. 12 at a nursing home in Hartford. She was 99, and it seems almost beside the point to note that she had been an agricultural economist for the University of Connecticut.         To say that Miss Smith followed her own path would hardly do justice to someone who became a farm specialist after growing up on the streets of Chicago.         But Miss Smith, who spent several girlhood summers on a farm, was ever an original, one whose career included driving a hotel jitney in Florida, starting and running the country store for Henry and Clara Ford's Wayside Inn in Sudbury, Mass., and creating and starring in ''Millie's Market Basket'' on Connecticut television.         Never one to be hampered by convention, Miss Smith went to work for the agriculture department of the Connecticut Agricultural College before she received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago; became an assistant professor at the University of Connecticut (as the agricultural college became in 1938)  before she received a master's degree from Radcliffe College, and never did bother to get a doctorate, although she did complete postgraduate studies at the London School of Economics.         For someone born in the Victorian era, Miss Smith adapted well to 20th-century culture, much to the occasional dismay of her mother, a staid woman who had derived her Victorian outlook in situ, growing up in  England, and who was properly shocked when her daughter, who had not come of age in the Roaring Twenties for nothing, would go off for weekends with her young man of the moment.         (Miss Smith, whose romantic life  became a subject of intense speculation among her grandnieces and grandnephews, apparently found a satisfying solution to the problem of juggling job and family: attracting a steady supply of smitten suitors without actually succumbing to matrimony. She derived enormous delight a few years ago when she received a proposal from an admirer at her Hartford retirement community on the very day the Social Security Administration notified her that she had died -- as, it turned out, another Mildred Smith had done.)         Miss Smith's sense of personal mission began early. With three of her four older brothers serving in the military in World War I, she was so eager to do her part that, ignoring her mother's objections, she dropped out of the University of Chicago to enlist in the Women's Land Army, a paramilitary organization that sought to fill the vacuum left by mobilized farm workers.         Typically, Miss Smith, who had a lifelong fascination with statistics, not only picked apples and dug potatoes on a farm in East Corinth, Vt., but counted them, computing yields and other data for reports that she later deposited with the Schlesinger Library at Radcliffe.         After the fall harvest one year, the farmer whose land she had worked tried to find her a winter job at a resort that his friend Henry Ford owned in Eustis, Fla., but wondered whether Miss Smith knew how to drive, a requirement for the job of shuttling guests to and from the train station.         In a reply that later delighted her grandnieces and grandnephews, Miss Smith reassured him: ''I've been driving tractors since I was 12.''         Indeed, Miss Smith did so well as a jitney driver that she apparently impressed Ford and his wife, Clara. In 1923, when they bought the inn made famous by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, they recruited Miss Smith to start and run the country store that became a part of the historic restoration and preservation project.         By 1931, Miss Smith had found her life's work in academia, but after a decade as a statistician and consumer price specialist at the University of Connecticut, she decided that it was time to complete her own college education.         So, again flouting convention, she returned to Chicago and received her degree at age 42.         Later, after becoming an assistant professor in 1943 and spending three years with the O.P.A.'s Boston office, she received a master's degree from Radcliffe.         She remained an assistant professor, but her work as a teacher and consumer marketing specialist -- among other things turning out pamphlets and conducting radio and television programs stressing thrift -- was so impressive that when she retired in 1961, she was named professor emeritus.         In retirement Miss Smith wrote historical pamphlets on New England agriculture and taught herself bookbinding, selling leather-bound notebooks and other items at craft fairs to finance her yen for travel, which included 18 trips to England and the Continent, where as a young woman, it should come as no surprise, she had climbed the Matterhorn.       
         Sister Irene Kraus, a onetime schoolteacher with such a high-spirited talent for leadership and such hard-nosed business ability that she went on to run a series of hospitals and spend six years as the founding chief executive of the $3 billion Daughters of Charity National Health System, died Aug. 20 at a hospital in Baltimore. She was 74 and lived in Emmitsburg, Md., where she was administrator of her order's provincial headquarters.         Friends said the cause was cancer.         While it is tempting to speculate on what direction her life might have taken if she had not joined the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, in an era when women's horizons were bounded largely by home and family, it would be hard to find a secular career path that would have allowed her to become president of the nation's largest nonprofit hospital chain.         But then for Sister Irene, who grew up in Philadelphia, the religious life seems to have been a foregone family conclusion. Like her business acumen and her boundless good humor, her religious commitment seems to have come from her father, Frank, a Pennsylvania Railroad executive with a weakness for practical jokes and such a spiritual bent, his daughter later recalled, that ''he would pray all the way to work, and when I went with him, I would pray, too.''         A standout student at the Daughters of Charity's Elizabeth Seton High School in Baltimore, Sister Irene graduated at 17 in 1941 and immediately joined the religious order.         After a year of novitiate training, she spent seven years teaching elementary and high school students in Richmond. Then her superiors decided it was time for her to get a college education and asked her to switch to a medical career.         After earning a nursing degree at the Catholic University of America in Washington in 1952, she quickly became an operating room supervisor, performing her duties at a series of hospitals with such efficiency and flair that three years later she was made administrator of Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton, N.Y., the first of several hospitals nationwide she ran for the order.         When the five autonomous American provinces of the Daughters of Charity decided to consolidate their hospital systems in 1986, Sister Irene was the obvious choice to put the merger into effect and run the operation, which included three dozen hospitals and 19 other operations in 17 states with a combined annual budget of more than $3 billion.         And over the next six years, during a period of mounting fiscal and other pressures, she proved more than equal to the task of meshing often incompatible accounting and other systems into an efficient operation with common purchasing and other functions.         In addition to its embrace of women's potential, the religious order gave Sister Irene other advantages. In a business world where women have had to pick their way through contradictory advice on how to dress for success, Sister Irene never had a wardrobe worry. Whether conducting a board meeting or entertaining at a reception, she wore a version of the same understated habit, a simple blue dress, she had worn as an elementary school teacher.         If the men she encountered were unaccustomed to dealing with a hard-driving business woman in a habit, Sister Irene, a raconteur with an impish sense of humor, knew how to put them at ease and rarely stopped there. At stodgy gatherings, Sister Irene, a tall, imposing woman with a commanding laugh, would sometimes break into an impromptu dance. And when she got up from her seat at a formal dinner to ''work the room,'' Sister Irene would be easy to track: She inevitably left a trail of laughter in her wake.         During a career in which she served on more than 70 national boards and committees, Sister Irene became accustomed to being the only woman in the room. And in 1980, when she became the first woman to serve as chairman of the American Hospital Association, she headed off a move to call her chairwoman or chairperson. She told the board, ''I didn't work this hard to get here and have my title changed.''         For all her accomplishments as president of the national system, Sister Irene, who later ran a hospital in Pensacola, Fla., and was still vice chairman of the merged Baptist St. Vincent's Hospital system in Jacksonville, Fla., at the time of her death, said her proudest achievement was developing a five-point value system for the national chain. The first four, including treating people with respect and serving the impoverished, sounded like familiar religious principles. The fifth, ''Be Creative to Infinity,'' sounded exactly like Sister Irene.         Sister Irene is survived by three sisters, Gertrude Hunter and Maguerite Williams of Bel Air, Md., and Dolores Freeman of Willards, Md.       
         Dorothy Manners Haskell, who became the Hollywood columnist for the Hearst Corporation after 30 years as the assistant to its syndicated columnist Louella Parsons, died on Tuesday at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 95.         Writing under the name Dorothy Manners, she took over when Parsons retired in 1965 and wrote a syndicated column for King Features, the Hearst subsidiary, until her own retirement in 1977.         In her heyday, Miss Manners was a frequent guest on the television talk shows of Steve Allen, Joey Bishop, Dick Cavett and Mike Douglas, and she was cited by the California Women's Press Club in 1966 as entertainment columnist of the year.         Miss Manners was born on July 30, 1903, in Fort Worth. When her parents divorced in 1919, she moved to Hollywood with her mother and began a career as an actress.         She appeared as an extra in films starring Gloria Swanson, Douglas Fairbanks and William Powell, and acted under the direction of Cecil B. DeMille.         But by her own admission she was an unexceptional actress, and she decided to become a writer. She began with The Hollywood Citizen and was soon hired by The Los Angeles Times to write entertainment features.         Shortly thereafter, she joined Motion Picture magazine to write a monthly gossip column. She became Parsons' assistant in 1935.         Miss Manners's 10-year marriage to Walter Ramsey ended in divorce. Her second marriage, to John Haskell, lasted 30 years, until his death in 1977.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Shari Lewis, who used her estimable skills as a ventriloquist and puppeteer to win 12 Emmy Awards and the hearts of parents and their children for four decades with a woolly hand puppet named Lamb Chop, died on Sunday at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 65 and lived in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The cause was complications from uterine cancer, which was diagnosed in June. Ms. Lewis had been undergoing chemotherapy for six weeks, said her spokeswoman, Maggie Begley.  She was thought to be doing well but then developed pneumonia, she said.         Ms. Lewis's illness caused her to cut short her production in Vancouver of the latest television series she was creating for PBS, ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza.'' The series began last January and has been a mainstay of PBS programming for children. A spokesman for PBS said yesterday that three remaining episodes will be broadcast in the fall.         This year marked Ms. Lewis's 50th anniversary as a performer. Her career started in 1948 when she appeared in a local NBC show in New York and pulled a rabbit out of a hat (her father had taught her the trick only the day before). Her last PBS series before ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' was ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along,'' which ran from 1989 to 1995. The show won five Emmys in five years as well as a New York International Film Festival Gold Award and many other prizes. She also created holiday specials, including ''Lamb Chop's Special Hanukkah,'' on PBS in 1995, and ''Shari's Passover Surprise,'' with Dom DeLuise as a guest.         Earlier this year, Ms. Lewis said she got the idea for ''The Charlie Horse Music Pizza'' during a conversation with her husband, the publisher Jeremy Tarcher, in which they decided that what children liked most was music, pizza and the beach. The show features Mr. DeLuise as a cook and Chancz Perry as an orangutan who delivers pizza by skateboard.         Ms. Lewis was acknowledged to have all the instincts of a multifaceted entertainer. Although she was never a schoolteacher, she knew how to reach children with her puppet  sidekicks, chief among them being Lamb Chop, an ageless curly- haired creature who would interrupt Ms. Lewis with all manner of observations and questions. Lamb Chop was arguably her most beloved puppet, but in the eyes of children who watched her shows, Charlie Horse and Hush Puppy weren't far behind.         ''I'm a role model,'' she said. ''It's really very funny because I never play teacher. I never play parent. I play older playmate.'' She did this most convincingly even in her 60's.         She was a playmate who loved good music and throughout her career she invented ways to encourage children to love it as she did. And so, when she created ''Lamb Chop Loves Music,'' Ms. Lewis played the piano in the show, which led Lamb Chop to insist that she wanted to learn to play too. Ms. Lewis then told Lamb Chop that her desire to learn piano wasn't enough, that she had to do much more. Lamb Chop had to learn all the instruments, Ms. Lewis said. Lamb Chop agreed, whereupon a collection of instruments came to life to provide a lesson about woodwinds, strings, brass and percussion.         Ms. Lewis felt that ''musical training teaches something that is seldom learned in any other manner: namely, that if you stick to what you are trying to do, you will, eventually, 'get it.' '' She was convinced that the study of a musical instrument builds  neurological connections and better study habits.         She did not limit herself to using her sock puppets to persuade children that they ought to learn an instrument. She took to the podium and conducted symphony orchestras in the United States, Canada and Japan, offering music she thought children would like, especially the sounds of Beethoven, Bizet, Mozart and Stravinsky.         She wrote 60 books for children, including ''Magic For Nonmagicians,'' ''Things That Kids Collect,'' ''One-Minute Bedtime Stories,'' ''One-Minute Favorite Fairy Tales'' and ''One-Minute Greek Myths.'' She also made many recordings, filmstrips and videos for children.         Shari Lewis was born on Jan. 17, 1934, in New York City. Her spokeswoman and family members said she was 65, although the birth date listed in reference books would have made her 64.         She was the daughter of Abraham B. Hurwitz, a college professor who doubled as a magician, and Ann Hurwitz, a music coordinator for the New York City Board of Education and an accomplished pianist. Her mother was an energetic woman who began teaching her daughter piano at the age of 2. But Ms. Lewis said often that she was not a natural pianist and that her passion for music began the day she tucked a violin under her chin.         She studied music theory and orchestration, as well as piano and violin at the High School of Music and Art; dance at the School of American Ballet, and acting with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse. She even found time to take baton-twirling lessons.         She seemed to learn ventriloquism on her own. When she was a girl, her father thought he heard a voice coming out of a closet in the Hurwitz's apartment. When he discovered that his daughter had been able to throw her voice there, he found a former vaudevillian to coach her.         She attended Columbia University  and in the 1950's was married briefly to Stan Lewis. She married Mr. Tarcher in 1958. He survives her, along with their daughter, Mallory. Both her husband and daughter collaborated with her in her projects.         Ms. Lewis did not initially gravitate to puppeteering. Her skills in acting and dancing earned her roles in touring company and summer stock productions of ''Damn Yankees,'' ''Bye, Bye, Birdie'' and ''Funny Girl.'' She also performed in nightclubs and casinos and did dramatic roles in television.         Her first big break in show business came in 1952 when she appeared on Arthur Godfrey's televised ''Talent Scout'' show. In 1957 she introduced Lamb Chop on ''Captain Kangaroo,'' which led to her own morning television program for NBC, ''The Shari Show.'' Ms. Lewis's puppets were a staple on NBC from 1957 to 1963.         From 1968 to 1976, she was in London, doing her own television series on BBC-1 every Sunday night, as well as specials that were seen in Canada and Australia.         Ms. Lewis returned to children's television in the United States with ''Lamb Chop's Play-Along.'' She said her work kept her young: ''If you follow your heart, your heart sings and you just dance to that music.''         Peggy Charren, a longtime champion of better television programming for children and a close friend of Ms. Lewis's, recalled yesterday what it was like when Ms. Lewis, accompanied by Lamb Chop, showed up in Washington in 1993 to appear before the House Telecommunications Subcommittee, which was holding hearings on how to strengthen the provisions of the Children's Television Act of 1990.         Ms. Lewis vehemently defended the need to strengthen such protection and then informed Representative Edward Markey, a Democrat  from Massachusetts and chairman of the subcommittee, that Lamb Chop wanted to testify, too. Mr. Markey readily agreed.         Lamb Chop turned to Ms. Lewis and said, ''O.K., you can go now.''         ''If I go, you don't talk,'' Ms. Lewis replied.         So Ms. Lewis remained and Lamb Chop, who always rose to the occasion, gave an impassioned speech about the need for Government to care about children and children's television and to protect young viewers from junk. ''It was one of those things that nobody who was there will ever forget,'' Ms. Charren said.         In Washington yesterday, Ms. Lewis's accomplishments as an educator were praised by Richard W. Riley, the Secretary of Education.         ''By combining humor with teaching and entertainment,'' he said, ''Shari taught us we can laugh and learn at the same time.''         Correction:  August 8, 1998, Saturday  An obituary on Tuesday about the ventriloquist and puppeteer Shari Lewis misstated the name of her first show for NBC television, in 1957. It was ''Shariland,'' not ''The Shari Show.'' From 1960 to 1963, her program was called ''The Shari Lewis Show.'' ''The Shari Show,'' a syndicated program, began in 1975.       
         Jean Fair Mitchell, a violin-playing, jig-dancing Scottish-born educator who guided the venerable Brearley School for girls from the white-glove 1940's through the armband 1960's without missing a beat, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital near her home in Manhattan. She was 88 and had been the Brearley headmistress from 1947 to 1975.         Brearley, or the Brearley as it tends to be known by those who have trod its halls at 83d Street and the East River, has been a forward-looking New York institution since it was founded in 1884 to provide an education for the intellectually gifted daughters of the New York elite.         And by Miss Mitchell's time, its modern character had largely been set by her redoubtable predecessor, Millicent Carey McIntosh, whose departure in 1947 created the opportunity for a remarkable academic trade, one in which Brearley sent Mrs. McIntosh to Barnard College to become dean (and eventually president) and Barnard dealt Miss Mitchell, a member of its English faculty, to Brearley as headmistress.         For all the high-spirited comment it occasioned, the swap was largely a coincidence. After scrutinizing 75 candidates in a five-month search for Mrs. McIntosh's successor, the Brearley trustees announced that Miss Mitchell had been the board's first choice.         If her first decade or so presented few challenges in an era that is, after all, recalled as the quiescent 1950's, Miss Mitchell, a short, husky woman of verve who declaimed the poetry of Robert Burns in authentic dialect and Scottish burr, wasted little time in putting her own stamp on the school. Brearley had made social history by welcoming Jewish students as early as the 1880's, but Miss Mitchell promptly advanced its commitment to social diversity by recruiting its first black students, an effort aided by a Rockefeller Foundation grant to provide scholarships for needy minority students.         She also left her mark on Brearley students. For a woman who had such an austere public persona that girls would sometimes quake before being sent to her office for discipline, Miss Mitchell proved to be a pussycat in private, a warm and understanding woman who seemed to identify with troublemakers, perhaps because as a schoolgirl she had been one herself.         A native of Kirkcaldy, a Scottish town known less for its heather, she liked to point out, than for a large linoleum factory, Miss Mitchell was apparently such a hell-raiser during her school days that when she became headmistress at Brearley, the headmaster of her former school congratulated her as a ''poacher turned gamekeeper.''         Miss Mitchell, who would sometimes tell horror stories about the corporal punishment girls endured at Scottish schools, came away with such an aversion to punishment of any kind that she became famous at Brearley for her reluctance to suspend even the most recalcitrant troublemakers.         Her identification with the aspirations, frustrations and occasional fractiousness of the young was so complete that when the 1960's brought a wave of youthful unrest and rebelliousness over the Vietnam War, she quietly defused the anger among Brearley students, granting upperclassmen, for example, a day off to participate in an antiwar demonstration.         While Brearley students were as rebellious as any teen-agers in the 1960's, Miss Mitchell tended to be so understanding and accommodating that she left the rabble-rousers with little to complain about. When, for example, students decided that Brearley's infamous blue tunic and skirt uniforms, which they had long complained made them look like pears, were symbols of regimentation and oppression, she allowed students to wear more or less whatever they wanted.         Miss Mitchell, who was credited with strengthening science and mathematics courses, also responded positively to student complaints that the Brearley curriculum was not relevant to modern society. But the changes she authorized, like allowing students to substitute Spanish for German and complete their Latin requirements before high school, did not reach the level of some 1960's academic silliness and left the tough core curriculum unscathed.         Miss Mitchell, who received a master's in English from the University of Edinburgh, trained to be a teacher, spent five years teaching at an Edinburgh girls school, then came to the United States in 1936 as a postgraduate fellow at Smith College. She later joined the Smith faculty and taught at Sarah Lawrence for a year before going to Barnard in 1944.         For all her devotion to education, Miss Mitchell, whose father was an engineer, came close to pursuing a music career. At the time she was offered her first teaching post, he was also offered a job as violinist with the Edinburgh Symphony.         She apparently chose education over music as a career because she knew she could always pursue her love of music on her own, as she did at Brearley, where she would play chamber music with students, and at her summer home (a converted one-room schoolhouse) in Blue Hill, Me., where she was deeply involved with the Kneisel Hall music school.       
         Carol Hochberg, an investment banker who turned a diagnosis of breast cancer into a life of advocating for fellow sufferers, died of the disease on Wednesday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 40.         When Ms. Hochberg learned of the cancer, her first reaction was to fight, said her mother, Audrey G. Hochberg, a Democratic Assemblywoman from Scarsdale, N.Y.         ''We have to get out there and kick,'' Carol Hochberg said in a New York Times interview in 1995. She channeled her anger and energy into Share, a lobbying and self-help group for women with breast or ovarian cancer. After seeking advice there, she rapidly became a volunteer, a board member and a lobbyist.         The cancer arrived, she once said, at a ''most opportune time.''         After graduating from the University of Pennsylvania and earning an M.B.A. at Harvard, she began working on Wall Street. Eight years later, in 1994, she was an investment banker at Schroder Wertheim & Company, with a six-figure salary and a substantial personal portfolio.         But by then, she said, she had decided that there was ''more to life than making rich men richer,'' as she put it. She quit her job and gave herself a year to figure out how to spend the rest of her life. She read, visited relatives and friends, and traveled to Antarctica, Brazil and the Galapagos Islands.         Before the year was over, she learned that a lump in her left breast was cancerous. ''She leaned into it,'' said Alice Yaker, who recently retired as Share's executive director, referring to both the disease and the cancer support center.         Ms. Hochberg recalled in 1995: ''I was waiting for something to be committed and enthusiastic about. I guess I took cancer as a sign.''         Ms. Hochberg, who believed that knowledge was control, read every article, book and on-line file she could find about breast cancer. She volunteered on the Share phone line, answering the questions of other women with the disease. She kept in touch with callers who seemed to be especially alone, like a young Chinese woman who had recently arrived in New York. She introduced a more sophisticated system of budgeting and financial planning to Share. And she helped to raise money, persuading relatives and Wall Street friends to contribute and donating some of her own money.         And she immersed herself in the politics of breast cancer, working to get insurance coverage for women who were uninsured or entering clinical trials, and in the financing of medical research.         She became a dedicated lobbyist, frequently traveling to Albany and Washington to persuade legislators to support breast cancer issues. She spoke to President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, about the need for more money for cancer research, and, on a panel with Vice President Al Gore, she described her experiences as a cancer patient. She was the sole layperson on some panels at several medical conventions.         When she learned last year that her cancer had spread to her brain and bones, she intensified her activism.         At a meeting of cancer researchers at the Sunnybrook and Women's College Health Science Center in Toronto, she made a dry presentation of metastatic medical issues vivid with her presence and words.         Besides her mother, Ms. Hochberg is survived by her father, Herbert Hochberg, and two sisters, Brenda Hochberg of Boston and Judith Hochberg of Los Alamos, N.M.       
         Muriel Humphrey Brown, who grew from a shy girl from South Dakota into a confident woman during political campaigns for her first husband, Hubert H. Humphrey, and then was named to fill his seat in the Senate at his death in 1978, died today at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. She was 86 and lived in Plymouth, Minn.         In recent years, Mrs. Brown appeared rarely in public but on Tuesday stood at the side of her son, Hubert Humphrey 3d, Minnesota's Attorney General, when he won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination for governor.         ''Hubert would have been proud,'' she said after her son's victory.         There were many victories in the lives of Hubert and Muriel Humphrey and many setbacks as well. After Humphrey served as Vice President under Lyndon Baines Johnson, he lost to Richard M. Nixon in 1968 when Johnson decided against seeking re-election.         Humphrey had also been defeated for his party's Presidential nomination in 1960 by John F. Kennedy. Muriel Humphrey was at her husband's side for these elections and when he died after returning to the Senate, she was a logical and sentimental choice to succeed him until the 1978 election, when she did not run to keep the seat.         Because of her shyness she had to work at the roles that came to her.         ''If someone had told me what would be happening to me today,'' she said after the Democrats nominated Humphrey for President in 1968, ''well, it would have been an awful thing to have thought of. I just wanted to be a wife.''         Hubert Horatio Humphrey ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the constant campaigner of the constant candidate.         In her roles as the wife of a public figure and in her own brief time in the Senate, Muriel Humphrey supported the social programs that her husband championed. She pressed for the right of a woman to have an abortion and, when her granddaughter Vicky was born mentally disabled, she became involved in work for people with mental disabilities.         In 1988, when President George Bush disparaged liberalism, Muriel Humphrey responded: ''There's something I've been wanting to say for a long time. I'm a liberal and I'm proud of it. In fact, I was probably a little more liberal than Hubert was. I just wanted to say that.''         By then she was Muriel Humphrey Brown, having married Max Brown, a widowed Nebraska businessman who had been a classmate in Huron.         In addition to her husband and her son Hubert 3d, Mrs. Brown is survived by a daughter, Nancy Solomonson, and two other sons, Bob and Douglas, all of suburban Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.

''If someone had told me what would be happening to me today,'' she said after the Democrats nominated Humphrey for President in 1968, ''well, it would have been an awful thing to have thought of.

Hubert Horatio Humphrey ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the constant campaigner of the constant candidate.

They married in 1936, and Mrs. Humphrey worked as a bookkeeper at a utility company to put her husband through college.

         Betty Carter, one of jazz's great singers and a composer and arranger whose groups were virtual schools for generations of jazz musicians, died at home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn on Saturday. She was 69.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her friend Ora Harris.         Ms. Carter sounded like no one in jazz, with her own diction, her own phrasing and her own sense of pitch. Though she was firmly inside the jazz-singing tradition, she was an abstractionist as well, and for her words were pliable. On her early material -- she began a solo recording career in the mid-1950's -- her light, pure voice sounded instrumental, with curved, beautifully shaped notes. It was immediately noticeable that she was after something different, and that her technique, always extraordinary, was there to work for her ideas. It was equally clear that she was a jazz musician first and a singer second.         About a decade after beginning her recording career, Ms. Carter refined her originality into a style that became the template for modern jazz singing. On ''Look No Further,'' recorded in 1964, Ms. Carter uses her voice against the bass, then as the band comes in her note choice mirrors the experimentation of instrumentalists like John Coltrane and Miles Davis; during the same session she recorded ''My Favorite Things,'' a composition associated with Mr. Coltrane. Her improvisations were explosive, tumbling out in great leaps at a velocity that expressed unfettered artistic freedom.         But it was artifice. Ms. Carter was one of jazz's most articulate small-group arrangers, and few musicians have ever controlled tempo the way  she had; woe to the young musicians in the band who could not navigate the shockingly abrupt tempo changes or keep up with Ms. Carter's fastest or slowest tempos. Her snapping fingers, marking off the time, sent generations of musicians back to the practice room, chagrined.         In her hands a standard or her own compositions often contrasted some of jazz's slowest tempos with some of its fastest. She wasn't afraid to pare down the instrumentation of a group for a while, singing against piano or bass, orchestrating the arrival of other instruments. And the constant tempo-changing gave the impression of emotional extremity and careful control of the artistic environment. She sculptured sound, and it made her concerts some of the most moving experiences in jazz, a mixture of the emotional power of the songs' texts and the sheer joy of her imagination.         ''I started to change my material to keep the musicians interested,'' Ms. Carter said in a 1992 interview with The New York Times. ''What do you do with a chorus and a half? You change things, stretch them out, change speed. Most musicians I played with were so good they could do what was necessary.''         Ms. Carter grew up in Detroit, which in the 1940's and 1950's was a good environment for jazz musicians, with the city producing some of the best musicians of the time.         Detroit was a stop on the jazz circuit, and a young Ms. Carter sang with Charlie Parker, who came through town. One of her nicknames was Betty Bebop, a tribute to her interests. In 1948 she began working with Lionel Hampton and his band, staying with the vibraphonist until 1951, when, during a performance in New York, she decided to remain there. During the same time she recorded the female part for King Pleasure's version of ''Red Top,'' singing a vocal rendition of Gail Brockman's original trumpet solo.         In New York in 1955 and '56, Ms. Carter began recording for Epic Records and generally taking in the  city. In 1957, she recorded with Wynton Kelly and other peers; her work was irregular partly because her style was more jazz than cabaret, and partly because she tried to avoid  the abusive working situations that have plagued jazz.         In 1961 Ms. Carter recorded what has become a classic album, ''Ray Charles and Betty Carter,'' with Mr. Charles; it features the pair singing astringent duets including a famous version of ''Baby, It's Cold Outside.'' Ms. Carter worked with Mr. Charles from 1960 to 1963, the year she toured Japan with Sonny Rollins and recorded an orchestral album for Atco Records.         Through the 1960's Ms. Carter struggled with her career, recording with Roulette Records in the late 1960's, during which the avant-garde and pop music rendered some artists identified with an older style commercially irrelevant. But in 1969 she started her own recording company, Bet-Car Productions, and on that label she released her albums.         In 1988 Ms. Carter began a relationship with Verve Records that included the reissue of the Bet-Car label along with the recording of a series of new albums. That same year she released ''Look What I Got!,'' which won a Grammy, and in 1994 she recorded an album, ''Feed the Fire,'' with the pianist Geri Allen, the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette.         Also during the 1980's Ms. Carter, finally recognized for her innovations, became a concert draw internationally. She recorded duets with Carmen McRae, and she kept turning out well-rounded musicians, having trained them in her trio. Included in the alumni from the 1980's and the 1990's were the pianists Cyrus Chestnut, Benny Green, Stephen Scott, Marc Cary, Darrell Grant and Travis Shook. And her choice of drummers was extraordinary, having hired Greg Hutchinson, Clarence Penn, Winard Harper, Troy Davis and Lewis Nash. She began receiving numerous awards, including the National Medal of Arts given last year by President Clinton.         In 1993 she began the Jazz Ahead series at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a program that featured young and promising musicians.  This year the Jazz Ahead series was invited to appear at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.         Ms. Carter is survived by two sons, Myles and Kagle Redding, both of New York City. A marriage to James Redding ended in divorce.         ''The survival of jazz culture takes priority,'' Ms. Carter said in the interview with The Times. ''The survival of this culture depends on people playing it and living the life. The young guys playing it in 20 years will be taking the music somewhere else. There was a period where, in jazz, the music sent people away. But it's now back to making people feel better, putting happy smiles on their faces. When I was coming up, that's what jazz was about. It wasn't about money. It was about how happy you could make people.''       
         Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, the grande dame of sex education, died yesterday at the Kendal at Longwood nursing home in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 94 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last decade.         Indefatigable and fired by a zeal for sexual responsibility and realism, Dr. Calderone persuaded a recalcitrant American Medical Association to let doctors dispense birth control as a matter of course to their patients, and she set in motion the means of educating schoolchildren about human sexuality.         Dr. Calderone did more than any other individual to convince both the medical profession and the public that human sexuality goes far beyond the sex act. She heralded it as a multifaceted and vital part of a healthy life that should not be hidden under a shroud of secrecy or limited to erotic expression.         One of her favorite challenges to young audiences she addressed was to ask for a four-letter word ending in ''k'' that meant sexual intercourse. Over a chorus of titters, she would give her answer: ''talk.'' Then she would explain, ''We never talk to each other as nonsexual people.''         Dr. Calderone, the daughter of the photographer Edward Steichen, was a woman of many talents and diverse interests who did not find her true calling until midlife. Following graduation from Vassar College, where she majored in chemistry, she decided to go on the stage, but abandoned her acting career when she realized she could never be as good as Katherine Cornell.         At the age of 30, after a failed marriage to a fellow actor, W. Lon Martin, and the birth of two daughters, Nell and Linda, she decided to go to medical school.         She received an M.D. degree in 1939 from the University of Rochester and a master's degree in public health in 1942 from the Columbia University School of Public Health. While at Columbia she met Dr. Frank Calderone, then a district health officer on the Lower East Side who would soon become deputy commissioner of health for New York City and her second husband. The couple was married in 1941.         Dr. Calderone served for some years as a school physician in Great Neck, L.I. In 1953 she became medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, where she carried forward Margaret Sanger's mission for family planning.         In 1964 Dr. Calderone realized one of her crowning goals: she convinced the trustees of the American Medical Association that the nation's leading organization of physicians should disseminate information on reproduction and birth control and endorse the prescription of birth control measures to all patients who needed them. The trustees' proposal was adopted, helping to move birth control into the mainstream of American medicine.         Three years earlier, as a representative of family planning, she took part in the first American Conference on Church and Family run by the National Council of Churches. Attended by sociologists, religious leaders, educators and public health professionals, the conference highlighted the suffering of thousands of people because of ignorance about frigidity, impotence, homosexuality and contraception.         With five colleagues at the conference, Dr. Calderone set up an informal committee to study human sexuality. Out of that committee grew Dr. Calderone's signature achievement, the co-founding of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States in 1964. Dr. Calderone then resigned from Planned Parenthood to turn her attention from reproductive biology to education in human sexuality.         Better known by its acronym Siecus, the council was created to help teachers, therapists and other professionals establish human sexuality as an integral part of health and health education. Under her guidance, Siecus became the moving force for education about human sexuality in the schools as well as in the community. The organization publishes ''Guidelines for Sexuality Education: Kindergarten through 12th Grade'' and helps schools around the country set up comprehensive sex education programs.         As the president of Siecus, Dr. Calderone stood out in the 1960's as an innovator, one of a handful of educators, scientists and philosophers who were beginning to address the big topics of human existence like death and sexuality. She was an unstinting advocate for the acceptance of masturbation as a wholesome, normal and almost universal practice for people of all ages.         Dr. Calderone was far more than a female doctor championing a cause. Her theatrical training, coupled with her carriage, poise and authoritative voice, helped her to get her message across that children are born sexual beings and remain so until they die and that people of all ages need and deserve a proper sexual education.         Dr. Calderone believed sex education in the schools should start in kindergarten, and under her direction Siecus helped to set up sex education programs in thousands of schools throughout the country. After stepping down from the presidency, she joined New York University as an adjunct professor in its program on human sexuality. She was active professionally until age 80.         Almost from birth, Mary Steichen was a natural leader: optimistic, determined, resilient and forthright, who from early childhood knew how to speak her mind. At age 6, for example, she criticized the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, a family friend, for creating ''L'Oiseau d'Or'' with a horizontal head, a position that she said would make it impossible for the bird to sing. Brancusi's later bird sculptures had more uplifted heads.         Her imposing appearance combined with her strong personality helped her advance her causes and also to defend them against attacks by groups like the Christian Crusade, the John Birch Society and Moral Majority, who contended that her promotion of sex education in schools was encouraging a premature and unhealthy participation in sexual experience and usurping the role of parents in guiding their children's lives. Her reply was that if parents were doing their job properly there would be no need for school-based sex education.         A devout Quaker and a Republican, she was once labeled by the John Birch Society as an ''aging sexual libertine.'' She reminded her critics that modern children were in desperate need of sex education because they were sexually vulnerable: ''devoid of chaperones, supervision, rules and close family relations and subject to onslaughts of commercial sexual exploitation.''         But recognizing that a child's sexual attitudes are often shaped before school age, Dr. Calderone also focused on educating parents. Through Siecus she established Parent Learning Centers to teach adults about their own sexuality as well as their children's.         In 1981 she and Eric Johnson wrote a widely praised book, ''The Family Book About Sexuality,'' which was published in five languages. The following year, she and James W. Ramey were the co-authors of ''Talking With Your Child About Sex,'' published in four languages.         Dr. Calderone also contributed to many professional publications and served as editor of texts on abortion and family planning.         Though Dr. Calderone saw serendipity as a major architect of her success, she did not always lead a charmed life. She grew up as the daughter of a working artist. Her mother, Clara, was considered cold, and their relationship adversarial.         When her parents divorced, Mary, then 10, chose to live with her father. Not until nearly seven decades after the divorce was she able to bury the emotional hatchet that had estranged her from her mother.         Dr. Calderone's own experiences as a mother were also difficult. Her 8-year-old daughter, Nell, died of pneumonia, plunging her into a debilitating depression.         Her marriage to Dr. Calderone, who later became chief administrative officer of the World Health Organization, produced two more daughters, Dr. Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist, and Dr. Maria Calderone, a veterinarian in Galena, Ohio, born almost 20 years after her oldest daughter, Linda Hodes, a psychotherapist in Albuquerque, N.M.         The Calderones separated in 1979 but never divorced. Dr. Frank Calderone died in 1987.         In addition to her daughters, Mary Calderone is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 10, 1998, Tuesday  An obituary on Oct. 25 about Dr. Mary S. Calderone, who battled political and religious groups to take sex education to schools, misstated her political affiliation. She was a Democrat, not a Republican. The list of survivors also misidentified the public health degree held by a daughter, Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist. It is a master's, not a doctorate.       
         Barbara Thornton, a singer and musicologist who, with Benjamin Bagby, founded and directed Sequentia, the medieval music ensemble, died last Sunday at the Caritas hospice in Cologne, Germany. She was 48 and lived in Cologne.         The cause was complications from a brain tumor, Jon Aaron, her manager, said.         Ms. Thornton, whose soprano voice had a mezzolike hue and a texture that gave it a distinctive character, was a specialist in the music of the 12th-century abbess Hildegard von Bingen, and it was largely because of Ms. Thornton's performances and recordings with Sequentia that Hildegard and her works have lately become the focus of scholarly and popular interest.         In 1982, when Sequentia toured with a production of Hildegard's ''Ordo Virtutum,'' an allegorical work in which the soul is confronted by both the Virtues and the Devil, Hildegard was virtually unknown outside a small circle of musicologists and students of medieval sacred works. Since then, the ensemble has recorded virtually all of Hildegard's extant music for the Deutsche Harmonia Mundi label, including two versions of ''Ordo Virtutum.'' When Sequentia offered its production again last summer, at the Lincoln Center Festival, it was a popular draw, and one of at least three versions of the work presented in New York City this year.         Ms. Thornton was born in Summit, N.J., and graduated from Sarah Lawrence College. During a tour with the Sarah Lawrence European Chorus in the early 1970's, she decided to continue her studies in Europe, and coached in the operatic repertory with teachers in Amsterdam, Zurich and Cremona, Italy. Her growing interest in early music led her to Basel, Switzerland, where she enrolled at the Schola Cantorum Basiliensis, from which she received an advanced diploma in 1977.         She met Mr. Bagby, a singer and medieval harpist, in Basel in 1974, and started Sequentia with him in 1977. Like many early-music ensembles, Sequentia expanded and contracted as the music required, sometimes using solo voices and a single accompanying instrument, sometimes drawing on a men's choir, the Sons of Thunder; a women's choir, Vox Feminae, and medieval harps, strings, flutes and hurdy-gurdy.         Besides its Hildegard series, Sequentia recorded three disks of sacred works from Spanish monasteries -- including the ''Codex las Huelgas'' and works composed for King Alfonso X (''El Sabio'') -- as well as several collections of courtly love songs and a compilation of sacred and secular works by Oswald von Wolkenstein, a knight, poet and composer who straddled the 14th and 15th centuries.         She is survived by Mr. Bagby, her companion; her parents, Fletcher and Margaret Thornton of Exeter, N.H., and two sisters, Susan Frey Starbuck of Seattle and Anne Thornton Bridges of Woodstock, Vt.       
         Paula Kissinger, a refugee from Nazi Germany who held the Bible at the White House in 1973 when her first-born son, Henry, was sworn in as Secretary of State, the highest Cabinet post in her adopted land, died at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center yesterday in Manhattan. She was 97.         From the time she arrived in America in 1940 with her husband and two young sons until the time she died, Mrs. Kissinger lived in the same apartment in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan, where  she was well known and well regarded by the once large German-Jewish  emigre community there.         It was Mrs. Kissinger -- the practical one in the family -- who decided that they had to leave Germany when Hitler came to power. Dr. Henry Kissinger told his biographer, Walter Isaacson, that his father was reluctant to recognize the growing evil around him. ''My father was lucky he had an earthy wife who made all the decisions,'' he said.  ''She looked after necessities.''         She got in touch with a cousin in New York, and it was soon arranged.  ''It was my decision, and I did it because of the children,'' she told Mr. Isaacson. ''I knew there was not a life to be made for them if we stayed.''         Mrs. Kissinger was born Paula Stern in 1901 into a prosperous middle-class family in Leutershausen. In 1922, she married Louis Kissinger.  He was 35; she was 21. They moved to Furth, where he was a teacher, and within the year their first son, Heinz Alfred, was born. He took the name Henry when the family came to the United States. The next year a second son, Walter Bernhard, arrived. Both sons, as well as six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren, survive Mrs. Kissinger.         When she arrived in New York she quickly mastered the language and, to supplement the money earned by her husband and her sons, she became a cook and a caterer in Washington Heights. She refused to leave the neighborhood, even after her husband died 10 years ago and her elder son asked her to move in with him and his wife downtown.         Several years ago, she fell in her kitchen and was unconscious for several hours. She was put on a life-support system, but when doctors wanted to remove it, her son Henry refused. When the doctors explained that she wouldn't be able to think or speak, he replied, ''You don't know my mother.'' After being unconscious for days, she awoke and asked him, ''What day is it?'' When he told her it was Tuesday, she said, ''Cancel my 10 o'clock dentist appointment.''         She returned to Germany a few times, once when Dr. Kissinger was given an honorary degree. She was struck by the unreality of it all.  ''First you get chased away, and then you get treated like royalty,'' she told a reporter. Back home, when her son came to visit, the neighborhood was all excited and she admitted to being proud: ''They say, 'My son the doctor.' What should I say, my son the Aussenminister?' ''       
         Elisabeth A. Owens, who helped to shape the field of international tax law and in 1972 became the first woman ever granted tenure at Harvard Law School, died on Sunday at Falmouth (Mass.) Hospital. She was 79 and lived in Falmouth.         The cause was complications of Parkinson's disease, said her niece Charlotte Harris.         Tenure did not come easily for Professor Owens. Former students and faculty colleagues alike say she  was denied it for years because of her sex. Speaking to a reporter for the Harvard Law Bulletin in 1988, another professor at the law school,  Milton Katz, described the granting of tenure for her as ''a delayed justice,'' and Professor Owens herself said at the time, ''It was a decision that I also felt was overdue.''         Asked for comment yesterday, Michael Chmura, a spokesman for the law school, said Harvard did not comment on faculty appointments other than to announce them.         Even after Professor Owens had gained tenure, said Ms. Harris, her niece, she was assigned, condescendingly, to teach women's' studies. After a year of that, she refused to teach the subject and returned to her main interest, international tax law.         Elisabeth Ann Owens was born in Boston and graduated from Boston Girls Latin School and from Smith College, summa cum laude. She received her bachelor of laws degree from Yale Law School in 1951 and subsequently became a research assistant to the tax expert Stanley S. Surrey at Harvard Law School.         After a year in the Office of the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington, she began teaching full time at Harvard. Asked once by a reporter how she had decided to concentrate on tax law, she said: ''I think at one point Professor Surrey asked me, 'What is creditable tax?' My answer turned into three books.''         Professor Owens was the author of ''The Foreign Tax Credit'' (I.T.P., 1961), which Prof. Oliver Oldman of Harvard called ''one of the best tax books ever written.'' Professor Oldman said the beauty of the work was the way it organized ''the law into a structured, reasoned whole.''         Professor Owens was also the author, with Gerald Ball, of the two-volume ''The Indirect Credit'' (I.T.P., 1975 and 1979).         In midcareer, Professor Owens also developed an interest in natural resources law. She retired in 1981.         She is survived by her sisters Margaret Harris, of Falmouth, and Mary Bemis, of Randolph, Mass.; her brothers, Cornelius Owens of West Roxbury, Mass., and Graham Owens of Yarmouth Port, and 15 nieces and nephews, including her nieces Mary Owens and Charlotte Harris, with both of whom she lived in Falmouth.       
         Rumer Godden, the prolific British author of ''Black Narcissus'' and  ''The River,'' and a writer of children's books that are enjoyed throughout the world, died on Sunday at her home in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. She was 90.         In a career that began in 1935, Ms. Godden published some 70 novels, children's books, memoirs, biographies and collections of poetry and  stories, many set in India, where she spent her childhood and had her first success as a writer. She also had the experience, rare for most authors, of seeing two of her most widely admired novels, ''Black Narcissus'' and ''The River,'' turned into films that became classics.         Ms. Godden's third novel, ''Black Narcissus'' (1939), first brought her critical attention and commercial success. It told the story of nuns in  the order of the Servants of Mary who try to overcome psychological and physical challenges to establish a hospital and school on a remote, windswept Himalaya mountain. ''Black Narcissus'' was also the first of Ms. Godden's novels to be brought to the screen, in a memorable 1946 film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger that starred Deborah Kerr, David Farrar, Kathleen Byron, Sabu, Jean Simmons and Flora Robson.         Five years later Jean Renoir, the  French director, made ''The River,'' recognized as one of the great color films, an adaptation of Ms. Godden's novel about English children growing up in Bengal. Ms. Godden adapted her novel with Renoir and said that she learned invaluable lessons from him.         ''The River'' and ''Black Narcissus'' bore many of the trademarks of Ms. Godden's work. She was frequently praised for her rich settings and sensitive psychological portraits of children and headstrong, independent women. She was preoccupied with the loss of innocence, the moral problems of childhood and the nature of time. The lyricism and evocative power she often brought to her books sometimes disguised a toughness that addressed dark themes like poverty, jealousy, violence, sexual vulnerability and prejudice.         ''Ms. Godden has a magical skill in conjuring up with a few suggestive details a veritable panorama of Indian life,'' Orville Prescott once observed in The New York Times. ''And she has a wonderful way with fictional children, tender and true and never sentimental.''         In writing about Ms. Godden's  book ''Cromartie v. the God Shiva: Acting Through the Government of India,'' published last year, Bill Vourvoulias wrote in Newsday, ''One of the delights of reading a Rumer Godden novel is the magnetic pull of the exotic settings, affecting readers and characters alike.''         An Autobiography Written at Age 7         Margaret Rumer Godden was born on Dec. 10, 1907, in Sussex, England, the second of four daughters of Arthur Leigh and Katherine Hingley Godden. The family moved to India when she was less than a year old. Her father was a steamship agent and her childhood was spent in remote river towns throughout the British-ruled subcontinent. Until she was 12, Ms. Godden was largely educated by her family in a home that she later described as ''English streaked with Indian, or Indian streaked with English.''         Ms. Godden's precocity was evident during her early days in Bengal, where she wrote a fictional autobiography at age 7, vying with her sister Jon -- who also became a writer -- for the family literary laurels. As she later recalled, ''Part of the bliss of our childhood was that, being most of the year without the normal preoccupations of most girls of our ages, there was all the time in the world to think, avenues of time.''         These years left an indelible, earthy impression of India, quite unlike Kipling's land of the Raj. She evoked this in 1966 in the memoir ''Two Under the Indian Sun,'' which she wrote with Jon: ''The feel of the sunbaked Indian dust between sandals and bare toes; that and the smell. It was the honey smell of the fuzz-buzz flowers of thorn trees in  the sun, and the smell of open drains and urine, of coconut oil on shining black human hair, of mustard cooking oil and the blue smoke from cow dung used as fuel; it was a smell redolent of the sun, more alive and vivid than anything in the West.''         After their untrammeled Indian childhood, Ms. Godden and her sisters were sent to Britain in 1920 to complete their education. The change was shocking and Ms. Godden's time in Britain unhappy and rebellious, she wrote in her memoir ''A Time to Dance, No Time to Weep'' (1988). She bounced among  five schools before finally settling at  Moira House in Eastbourne, where her writing was encouraged. Later she attended ballet school despite a childhood spinal injury and was hooked on dance.         A Love of Dance And of Children         Ms. Godden returned to India in 1925 and opened a dancing school for children in Calcutta three years later, one of the first of its kind in that city. Overcoming social opprobrium, she operated the school for eight years. She considered a career as a choreographer, but in 1934 she married Laurence Sinclair Foster, a charming stockbroker and gambler  whom she later described as a philistine ''who thought Omar Khayyam was a curry.'' Their first child died shortly after birth, at the same time that Ms. Godden's first novel, ''Chinese Puzzle'' (1935), was accepted for publication. Although the couple subsequently had two daughters, their marriage ended in 1941 after Foster joined the army, leaving Ms. Godden with the children and huge gambling debts.         She moved with her children from Calcutta into the mountains of Kashmir, living in an isolated house set amid almond and cherry orchards. She supported her family through writing, teaching the local children, watching over the children of women doing war work in Calcutta, and selling herbal teas. She even survived a crazed cook's attempt to poison her before moving permanently to England in 1945.         Ms. Godden chronicled this time in ''Rungli-Rungliot'' (1943) and ''Bengal Journey'' (1945) and in other novels that addressed the transition from childhood to adolescence against the backdrop of life in colonial India. ''Kingfishers Catch Fire,'' a 1953 novel, concerned a widow and her two children living in Kashmir among people so poor that even a nail is worth stealing. The vicissitudes of time on family history was the theme of several of her novels set in Britain.         In London, in 1949, she married James Haynes-Dixon, a civil servant. Their marriage ushered in a long period of happiness, during which she continued to write, living  in London's Highgate section and in Henry James's Lamb House in Rye. Mr. Haynes-Dixon died in 1975. Ms. Godden is survived by two daughters, Paula Kenilworth and Jane Murray Flutter; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.         Acclaimed Novels That Became Films         Ms. Godden's novel ''The Greengage Summer,'' a critically acclaimed story about the sexual awakening of a teen-age girl in a pre-World War II French village, appeared in 1958; a film based on it called ''Loss of Innocence,'' starring Kenneth More, Danielle Darrieux and Susannah York, was released in 1961. ''The Battle of the Villa Fiorita'' (1963), a novel set in Italy about an adulterous affair seen through the eyes of two children who refuse to allow their mother to leave them and establish a new life, was also made into a film. So was ''In This House of Brede'' (1969), about a sophisticated London businesswoman who becomes a Benedictine nun.         To do research on ''In This House of Brede,'' Ms. Godden lived for three years near Stanbrook Abbey. Her experience with the nuns there contributed to her decision to convert to Roman Catholicism in 1968. In many of her stories and novels, Ms. Godden would write about the rewards and perils of the contemplative life.         Among her other work was ''Mooltiki: Stories and Poems from India'' (1957); ''A House with Four Rooms'' (1989), which takes up where ''A Time to Dance'' ended, and ''The Peacock Spring'' (1975), a novel about a British father and daughter in India who fall in love with Asians.         ''The Doll's House,'' the first and perhaps best known of her nearly two dozen children's books, appeared in 1947. The book told of a family of Dutch dolls owned by two girls in London. Like children, the dolls cannot act independently, but they can feel and wish for rooms of their own and comfortable feather beds. It was followed by many stories that interwove the lives of humans and dolls.         Ms. Godden did not patronize her younger readers and she had decided ideas about how to write for them. ''There are several things children  will not put up with in a book,'' she once observed. ''You have to have a proper beginning and end; you cannot have flashbacks. Then, you can't have a lot of description. And you must be very careful with words. They have to fit the case exactly and be chosen with extreme care.''         Ms. Godden's interest in children's literature also led her to write a biography of Hans Christian Andersen, compile a children's edition of Emily Dickinson's poems and translate two collections of verse by the French poet Carmen Bernos de Gasztold. She was given many prizes for her children's books and was awarded an Order of the British Empire in 1993.         Two years after her husband's death Ms. Godden moved to Scotland to live with her daughter Jane. She continued her routine of writing in the mornings and tending to her Pekingese dogs. She continued to write  widely translated children's books like ''The Little Chair'' (1996) and adult romances like ''Pippa Passes'' (1994), the story of a novice ballerina who falls in love with a gondolier in Venice.         She wrote into her final years and  never forgot India, returning to it in novels like ''Coromandel Sea Change'' (1991). ''To me and my kind,'' she once wrote, ''life itself is a story and we have to tell it in stories -- that's the way it falls. I have told the truth, yet not the whole truth, because that would be impossible.''
