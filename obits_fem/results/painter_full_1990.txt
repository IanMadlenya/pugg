        More than two dozen artists, writers, art critics, friends and former students paid tribute to Elaine de Kooning, the painter, art writer, teacher and wife of Willem de Kooning at a memorial service last night at Cooper Union in Manhattan. Mrs. de Kooning died of lung cancer on Feb. 1, 1989.         More than two dozen artists, writers, art critics, friends and former students paid tribute to Elaine de Kooning, the painter, art writer, teacher and wife of Willem de Kooning at a memorial service last night at Cooper Union in Manhattan. Mrs. de Kooning died of lung cancer on Feb. 1, 1989.         Among those who spoke at the more than two-and-a-half-hour service, which the editor Rose Slivka called ''the marathon memorial,'' were the poet John Ashbery, the gallery owner Leo Castelli, the artists Joop Sanders and Al Copley, the photographer Rudy Burckhardt and Mrs. de Kooning's brother Peter Fried. Many recalled not only Mrs. de Kooning's artistic agility and intelligence as a writer, but also her irrepressible humor, her capacity for friendship and generosity, and her fascination with language.         Slides were shown of her paintings from 1947 to 1988, including realistic landscapes and portraits as well as colorful abstract works informed by Abstract Expressionism and, in later years, inspired by the paleolithic cave drawings in France and Spain. The memorial was held on what would have been the artist's 70th birthday.         ''Art was her meaning, her solace, her exuberance,'' said the artist Herman Cherry.         'Complete Absorption'         Other artists spoke of Mrs. de Kooning's versatility, concentration and speed as a painter. ''She had an uncanny eye,'' said the artist Sherman Drexler. ''There was such complete absorption that enveloped her when she picked up a pen or brush.''         The audience of about 300 also saw a quarter-century's photographs by Hans Namuth of Mrs. de Kooning in her studio in East Hampton, L.I., and with Mr. de Kooning, whom she married in 1943. Grace Hartigan, an artist, recalled that when Mrs. de Kooning was asked how it felt to live in her husband's shadow, she replied, ''I lived in his light.''         Mrs. de Kooning - who taught at 15 colleges and universities, including Yale University, Carnegie-Mellon University, Cooper Union and Bard College - was also remembered for her enthusiasm as a teacher and her self-defined role as a ''fairy godmother'' to young artists. Barbara Schwartz, one of several former students who spoke, called her ''an ardent talent scout'' and said she is establishing a scholarship in Mrs. de Kooning's name at Bard.         Joan Washburn, a gallery owner, read excerpts from several of the many reviews and monographs Mrs. de Kooning wrote about contemporary art, citing her ''ability to move with complete abandon from the sublime to the ridiculous.''         Indeed, many spoke of Mrs. de Kooning's wit and remembered incidents like a baseball game she played in high heels and an invitation for coffee to someone who had mugged her. Others evoked her humor by quoting her often-disarming aphorisms, like: ''Take care of the luxuries; the necessities will take care of themselves.''

Lee Sievan, a photographer, died of a cerebral hemorrhage on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Fifty years ago, Mrs. Sievan began taking pictures to record the career of her husband, the painter Maurice Sievan. She also photographed performers and other artists, including Paul Robeson, Milton Avery and Mark Rothko.         Some of her photographs of New York City in the 1940's were recently displayed at the International Center for Photography, on Fifth Avenue at 94th Street, where Mrs. Sievan had worked as a librarian and archivist for 15 years. The photographs are now on view at the Museum of the City of New York.         She is survived by a sister, Bertha Hirt, of Manhattan.

Marguerite Falkenburg Wagstaff, a painter and a former tennis champion in Brazil, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old. She died of pneumonia, her family said. Mrs. Wagstaff, who was known as Mickey, met her first husband, Eugene Falkenburg, on a tennis court in Spain, where he was chief engineer for Westinghouse. They were married in Barcelona and their daughter, Eugenia, the model and television personality known as Jinx, was born there.         The family moved to Sao Paulo, Brazil, where she won the state tennis championship in 1927. Her sons Tom and Bob each won the United States Junior Championship twice and Bob was the Wimbledon champion in 1948.         After the death of her first husband, she married LeRoy Wagstaff, a retired chief engineer for American Home Products. A prolific artist, she had a studio in Southamption, L.I., where she became known for floral motifs. She produced more than 5,000 paintings that carry her signature, Mic.         She is survived by her daughter, Jinx, of Manhasset, L.I.; sons, Tom, of Stuart, Fla., and Bob, of Beverly Hills, Calif.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Joan Brown, an artist and professor of art at the University of California at Berkeley, was killed on Friday in an accident in Proddatura, India. She was 52 years old and lived in San Francisco.         The accident occurred while Ms. Brown, who in recent years was known for her use of imagery from ancient cultures, was installing her work in a reflecting pool at the new Heritage Museum, still under construction at Proddatura. Colleagues at the University of California said a concrete turret from a balcony collapsed and fell on her.         Starting out in the mid-1960's as a figurative painter in the thickly pigmented style of the so-called second-generation Bay Area artists, Ms. Brown gradually lightened her mode of painting and concentrated on imagery drawn from her personal life. A long-distance swimmer who regarded the sport as a means of meditation, she at this time used many images of swimmers in her art. Student of World Cultures         In the early 1970's she began traveling, informally studying world cultures. She drew inspiration for her work from the Egyptian and Hindu religions, and she made obelisks adorned with decorative patterns incorporating symbolic animal and human forms. In recent years, because of political and moral objections to the sale of art, she became involved in public art projects and made an effort to withdraw her work from the market.         Born and brought up in San Francisco, Ms. Brown attended the California School of Fine Arts -- later to become the San Francisco Art Institute -- from 1956 to 1960, and later received a master's degree in fine arts there, in 1962. In 1974 she joined the department of art at Berkeley, where, said Christopher Brown, the chairman of the department, she consistently won the highest rating as a teacher from faculty members and students.         Ms. Brown is survived by her husband, Michael Hebel, and a son, Noel Neri.       
         Ann Cole Phillips, a painter, died in New York Hospital on Friday night. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia after a long illness, her son, Calman, said.         Ms. Phillips's colorful, vivacious paintings in a semi-abstract style are found in a number of museum collections.         In a tribute to her work, Fairleigh Dickinson University in 1986 established the Ann Cole Phillips Room, a classroom, where students can study the artist's experience from her paintings on the walls around them.         At the height of her career in the 1950's and 1960's, Ms. Phillips's works were compared to Kandinsky, Dufy and Kokoschka. She worked in oils, pastels and lithography.         A native New Yorker, she attended the National Academy of Design and the Arts Students League. She also studied with such masters as Stuart Davis, Jacques Villon and Jose Clemente Orozco.         Besides her son, she is survived by a brother, George Columbus of Lake Worth, Fla., and a granddaughter, Jamey Phillips of New York City.       
         Ilse Bischoff, an illustrator and writer, died on Dec. 5 at her home in Hartland, Vt. She was 89 years old.         She died of Parkinson's disease, said her agent, David Stewart Hull.         She illustrated 12 books, published from 1928 and 1946. She wrote two novels about George Washington's portraitist, Gilbert Stuart: "Proud Heritage" (1949) and "Painter's Coach" (1943). Her autobiography was titled "Drive Slowly: Six Dogs" (1953). That same year, a children's book she wrote and illustrated, "The Wonderful Poodle," was published.         She studied in Munich, Germany, and at the Art Students League in New York City. Her work is represented in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the New York Public Library, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and the Hood Museum at Dartmouth.
