        Rose Kushner, a vigorous and tenacious advocate for women with breast cancer, died Sunday of the disease. She was 60 years old and lived in Kensington, Md.         Rose Kushner, a vigorous and tenacious advocate for women with breast cancer, died Sunday of the disease. She was 60 years old and lived in Kensington, Md.         Ms. Kushner gained national recognition in 1975, when she wrote about her battle with breast cancer in a book, ''Why Me? What Every Woman Should Know About Breast Cancer to Save Her Life,'' published by W. B. Saunders Company in Philadelphia. She became an influential voice questioning standard medical procedures and was a leader in the movement to change the way the disease is treated.         Many of the steps she advocated, especially less radical surgery, were at first rejected by leading breast cancer experts but are now common practice.         As the founder and director of the Breast Cancer Advisory Center in Kensington, Ms. Kushner provided women with crucial information about their options when facing breast cancer.         'Poetic Justice' in Award         She was a member of the National Breast Cancer Advisory Board from 1980 to 1986 and was appointed last year to the American Cancer Society's Breast Cancer Task Force.         This year, Ms. Kushner will be awarded the Society of Surgical Oncology's James Ewing Award for outstanding contributions by a lay person to the fight against cancer. This is ''poetic justice,'' said her husband, Harvey D. Kushner, because the society's members had ''booed her off their stage in 1975,'' after she had challenged their standard treatments.         ''A lot of people heard about her and trusted her,'' said Dr. Bruce A. Chabner, director of the division of cancer treatment at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md.         At the time of her death, Ms. Kushner was lobbying to encourage the Federal Government to require that health insurance companies cover mammograms.         A psychologist and medical writer, Ms. Kushner turned single-mindedly to her breast cancer crusade in 1974, when she found a lump in her breast but refused to submit to the then routine ''one step'' procedure.         In the mid-1970's, women would be anesthetized, the lump would be removed for biopsy on the spot and, if it was malignant, the breast would be removed. The patient would learn only upon awakening whether she had lost a breast. Ms. Kushner believed that women needed time after a cancer diagnosis to find the best surgeon to remove the breast.         She railed against the one-step procedure and, after 18 telephone calls, finally found a general surgeon to remove just her lump. She later found a breast cancer specialist to remove her breast when the lump proved cancerous.         Role in Changing Practice         Now, the one-step procedure that Ms. Kushner abhorred is no longer done.         ''She is probably the single most important person in leading to this major change in breast surgery,'' Dr. Chabner said. Although there was medical evidence that the one-step procedure was not advisable, Dr. Chabner added, ''I don't think the public would have accepted it or even known about it if she had not been so persistent in her efforts.''         Later, Ms. Kushner became an advocate for increased use of lumpectomy, in which the malignant lump is removed but the rest of the breast is left.         Ms. Kushner was born in Baltimore and graduated from the University of Maryland in 1972.         She is survived by her husband, Harvey; her sons, Gantt of Silver Spring, Md., and Todd of Rockville, Md.; a daughter, Lesley Kushner of San Francisco, and her brothers, Isaac and Meyer Rehert of Baltimore and Paul Rehert of West Palm Beach, Fla.       
        Margaret Craske, a leading ballet teacher in England and the United States, died on Sunday at Grand Strand General Hospital in Myrtle Beach, S.C. She was 97 years old.  A pupil of Enrico Cecchetti, the great Italian ballet pedagogue, Miss Craske danced for a short time with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes and toured with Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, in a small group that performed in English variety theaters during the 1920's.         Margaret Craske, a leading ballet teacher in England and the United States, died on Sunday at Grand Strand General Hospital in Myrtle Beach, S.C. She was 97 years old.  A pupil of Enrico Cecchetti, the great Italian ballet pedagogue, Miss Craske danced for a short time with the Diaghilev Ballets Russes and toured with Ninette de Valois, founder of the Royal Ballet, in a small group that performed in English variety theaters during the 1920's. She had her own studio in London, where she was ballet mistress for the Sadler's Wells (now Royal) Ballet and conducted examinations for the Imperial Society of Teachers of Dancing. She left for New York when, at the suggestion of the choreographer Antony Tudor, American Ballet Theater invited her to become the company's ballet mistress and teacher in 1946.         When Ballet Theater and the Metropolitan Opera House collaborated to open a school at the Metropolitan in 1950, she remained there to teach. It later became the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School, and Miss Craske became its director during her nearly-20-year association with the school. She left in 1968 to become ballet mistress of the Manhattan Festival Ballet. She also taught at Juilliard School and the Manhattan School of Dance, and for many summers at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival. She continued to teach at Manhattan School into her 90's. Among her students were Melissa Hayden, Hugh Laing, Nora Kaye, Carmen Mathe, Paul Taylor and Sallie Wilson.         Injury Ended Performing         Miss Craske was born in Norfolk, England. She began her professional career dancing in music halls. Serge Diaghilev chose her for his company in 1920 after seeing her in a class taught by Cecchetti. When a serious foot injury forced her to stop performing, Cecchetti asked her to help him teach at his London studio. In 1931, she set off for India to study with Meher Baba, an Indian guru. She remained with him for seven years and continued as a disciple for the rest of her life.         An austere, private woman with a sense of humor, Miss Craske was an extremely popular teacher who was known for the consistency and clarity of classes in which she would sometimes spend hours on a single step. ''She was a tiny woman - maybe all of five feet tall - with little feet in pink ballet slippers,'' a student, Nancy Reed, told Klasina VanderWerse for a 1983 feature on Miss Craske in Ballet News. ''She'd wear bell-bottomed trousers to teach in, and her feet would dart out of the trousers like hummingbirds, the pants flapping.''         Like Cecchetti, Miss Craske stressed exact technique and attention to detail in her teaching, emphasizing balance and encouraging her students to pay attention to the quality of movement and the anatomical and physiological workings of the body.         Friendly Competitiveness         Miss Craske was thought by many to have influenced Tudor's choreographic style, though she herself dismissed the notion. She and Tudor ''nipped'' at each other's teaching, as one student put it, as colleagues at the Metropolitan, with Tudor sometimes teaching students wild variations on the strict steps and gestures she had taught them the day before.         Like Tudor, however, she believed that movement must ''mean something,'' as she put it. ''There is no room in the world for dancers running around and around the stage and then kicking their right ear,'' she said in a 1983 interview. ''That doesn't mean a thing.''         Miss Craske retired from teaching in 1986, moving to Myrtle Beach, where she had served as a director of the Meher Spiritual Center for 11 years.         She was the author of two standard references on the Cecchetti technique: ''The Theory and Practice of Allegro in Classical Ballet,'' written with C. W. Beaumont in 1950, and ''The Theory and Practice of Advanced Allegro in Classical Ballet,'' written with Derra de Moroda in 1956. She also wrote ''The Dance of Love,'' published in 1980, and the recent ''Still Dancing with Love,'' a journal of her work with Meher Baba.       
        Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Since Mrs. Hyde was found to have cancer five years ago, she worked ardently to call attention to the disease, raising nearly $2 million for Georgetown University Medical Center, which established the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research last year.         In March she organized a benefit at the new Chanel boutique at the Willard Hotel in Washington for which 350 people paid $350 a ticket. The evening raised more than $50,000 for the Nina Hyde Center and an equal amount for Look Good . . . Feel Better, a separate counseling program that helps women after chemotherapy and radiation treatments.         As a reporter, Mrs. Hyde was known for covering fashion as intently as if she were covering a war, searching for the sociological significance of such trends as the development of the punk style in London.         Style of Protest Movement         Her article on that phenomenon helped draw attention at the end of the 1970's to the protest movement among the young. It also helped alert retailers to the London street scene.         She traveled through Europe and the Far East for exhaustive studies of the history of silk and of wool, with her analysis appearing in National Geographic. She was also noted for her ''Ins and Outs'' column on New Year's Day, which covered political and social trends as well as fashion.         She also conducted a lecture series at the Smithsonian Institution, with guests like the designers Issey Miyake, Norma Kamali and Sonia Rykiel.         But she was not averse to offering mundane, sensible advice to women on how to dress. Short skirts look younger than long ones, she believed. Classic shapes are good investments, she said. She advised her readers to buy clothes on sale and at discount. She herself usually wore black dresses and very little makeup.         The daughter of Dr. Harry A. Solomon, an internist, and his wife, Ruth, she was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College. One of two women accepted at the time for New York University's Law School, she dropped out to work for McCann-Erickson, the advertising agency, and the Maidenform Brassiere Company. Later she joined Women's Wear Daily as the corset and brassiere editor. In 1961, after marrying Lloyd Hyde, a real estate developer, she moved to Washington where she wrote a column, ''Hyde & Chic,'' for The Washington Daily News. After that newspaper's demise she joined The Washington Post, in 1972.         Celebrities Honor Writer         In 1986, when the Fashion Group decided to honor her at a formal dinner raising money for the group's' scholarship fund, she insisted that some proceeds go toward AIDS research. More than 800 people paid $150 to attend, including fashion designers like Bill Blass, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren from New York, Carla Fendi and Rosita Missoni from Italy and Jacqueline de Ribes and Thierry Mugler from Paris.         Fashion designers have been major contributors to the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research. Mr. Lauren was host at a cocktail party two years ago and donated $100,000 to get the fund started. Other supporters include Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Issey Miyake, Christian Lacroix and Yves Saint Laurent and the Chanel company.         Mrs. Hyde received the Eugenia Sheppard Award for outstanding fashion reporting by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1988 and she was made a Chevalier des Artes et Lettres in Paris last October.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Jennifer, of Washington, and Andrea, of San Francisco; her mother, Ruth Solomon of New York; a brother, Howard Solomon of Bethesda, Md., and a sister, Marquise Sue de Brantes, of St. Armand Lepypre, France.         The funeral will be held at 11 A.M. Monday at the Washington Hebrew Congregation at Macomb Street and Massachusetts Avenue.       
        Hope Williams, a debutante with a carefree manner, boyishly clipped blond hair and a humorous walk, who was a leading Broadway actress in the late 1920's and 30's, died of cardiac arrest last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         Hope Williams, a debutante with a carefree manner, boyishly clipped blond hair and a humorous walk, who was a leading Broadway actress in the late 1920's and 30's, died of cardiac arrest last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         Miss Williams, whose sole acting training was in amateur plays, gained notice in a Philip Barry comedy in 1927, ''Paris Bound,'' and won Broadway over as a rebellious socialite in ''Holiday,'' the classic comedy of manners in 1928 that Barry wrote for her.         The enthusiasm of reviewers and audiences was reflected in this appraisal by Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times: ''Miss Williams is one of the most clearheaded comediennes we have. She plays quietly with a sort of comic incandescence that is one of the superlative delights of this season. Through all the turns of the play she remains very much herself - boyishly awkward but quick and sparkling.''         Years later, Katharine Hepburn, who had understudied Miss Williams on Broadway and recreated the ''Holiday'' role in the 1938 movie that also starred Cary Grant, offered this tribute: ''I stole a great deal from Hope. She was the first fascinating personality from that period, 1929 to 1932, which wasn't really ready for her. She was a woman who blossomed with a little more than she was supposed to.''         Well-Bred Foil         Over seven years, Miss Williams was generally hailed in a handful of productions, including two revues, ''The New Yorkers'' and ''Strike Me Pink,'' in which she played a well-bred subtle foil to the riotous buffoonery of Jimmy Durante. She was also remembered for a world-weary role in Noel Coward's 1935 film, ''The Scoundrel.''         Mr. Coward wrote in his 1940 autobiography, ''Future Indefinite,'' that Miss Williams ''had a charming speaking voice with a sort of beguiling tonelessness.''         ''She was slangy without being vulgar,'' Coward added, ''modern without being brash, and her gaucheries of movement had a peculiar grace.''         Miss Williams was born in Manhattan on Aug. 11, 1897. Her father, Waldron, was a prominent lawyer. She attended the Brearley School and Miss Porter's Classes and learned acting in the Amateur Comedy Club and Junior League charity shows.         ''Too much has been made of this Park Avenue situation,'' she told an interviewer. ''What difference does it make what side of the railroad tracks a girl comes from, so long as she has charm and looks and ability?''         Effect of World War II         Miss Williams retired from acting after playing the careless governess Miss Prism in a 1939 Broadway revival of Oscar Wilde's ''Importance of Being Earnest.''         Miss Williams told a columnist for Playbill, Rebecca Morehouse, that when When World War II began ''everything changed.''         ''I have a ranch in Wyoming, and after my manager was drafted, I had to be there,'' Miss Williams said.         She divided her time between the 1,000-acre dude ranch outside Cody and her Upper East Side apartment and for a while ran a cooking school and recorded books for the blind.         Mrs. Morehouse observed in her column in 1983 that in later decades Miss Williams socialized in Manhattan almost without notice, often attended theater and music events and regularly dined with friends, often at her club, the Colony. Asked why she never resumed acting, she thought for a moment, smiled nonchalantly and replied, ''I guess that's because I have always had a privileged life.''         Some of the privileges came from her former husband, Dr. R. Bartow Read. They were married in 1922 and divorced in 1928. He was killed in a crash of his private plane in 1931, and his will, written in 1923, named her as his sole beneficiary.         Survivors include two nephews and five nieces.       
        Laura Perls, a founder of the Gestalt school of psychotherapy, died Friday in Pforzheim, West Germany. She was 84 years old.         Laura Perls, a founder of the Gestalt school of psychotherapy, died Friday in Pforzheim, West Germany. She was 84 years old.         She died of complications from a thyroid condition, said Daniel Rosenblatt, a Gestalt therapist in Manhattan who was a close friend.         In the late 1940's and 1950's, Mrs. Perls collaborated with her husband, Fritz Perls, to develop the theory and technique of Gestalt therapy. The therapy is an eclectic blend borrowing from such sources as the work of Freud and Wilhelm Reich, psychodrama, existentialism and a German theory of perception of the 1930's called gestalt.         Fritz Perls, a psychiatrist, was the better-known and more flamboyant of the pair, acting as teacher in residence at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, Calif., during the 1960's heyday of the human potential movement it expounded, and traveling the world to train therapists. He died in 1970.         A Turn to the Present         But among many Gestalt therapists, Laura Perls was seen as the mainstay of the movement, heading the major Gestalt training institute in New York City for almost 40 years, and an unacknowledged contributor to the early books by her husband that formulated the approach.         Gestalt therapy was one of the first psychotherapies to break with the traditional methods of psychoanalysis, which focused on the traumas of early life, and turn the focus on a person's emotions and perceptions at the present.         While the method met with intense opposition and criticism from analysts in its early days, Gestalt therapy is now recognized as a major approach to treating emotional problems, and its methods are widely employed even among therapists of other schools.         Some techniques that Gestalt therapists use derive from theater and movement. For instance, the therapy holds that each element in a patient's dream symbolizes an aspect of the self. In one technique, someone who dreamed about talking to a cigar-smoking conductor on a train might enact being, in turn, the cigar, the conductor and even the train.         Laura Perls, whose given name was Lore Posner, was born in 1905, the daughter of a prosperous merchant, in Pforzheim. She had returned to her birthplace earlier this year to be near her daughter, Renate Perls.         Studied With Theologians         As a student in Germany, Mrs. Perls took courses with the theologians Paul Tillich and Martin Buber and studied the work of the psychologists who had formed a new gestalt school, though not a method of treatment. These psychologists included Kurt Goldstein. A student of movement and dance as well as an accomplished pianist, Mrs. Perls became a psychoanalyst in Germany.         But she shared with her husband a dissatisfaction with Freudian orthodoxy that led them to the innovations that developed into Gestalt therapy. Many of the early developments have been attributed to her, including having the patient sit up and face the therapist rather than lying down as is traditional in psychoanalysis.         Laura and Fritz Perls met as students in Frankfurt and were married in 1930. They left Germany for South Africa in 1933 to escape the rise of fascism. Coming to America in 1948, they settled in New York City, where they founded the New York Institute for Gestalt Therapy in 1952. Mrs. Perls headed the institute until recent years.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Perls is survived by a son, Dr. Stephen R. Perls, a psychologist in Albuquerque, N.M.; a brother, Robert Posner, of Providence, R.I.; four grandchildren, and two great grandchildren.       
        Peggy Mann Houlton, the author of more than 35 books and many magazine articles, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Peggy Mann Houlton, the author of more than 35 books and many magazine articles, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 65 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Houlton died of breast cancer, her family said.         At a Congressional reception in 1985, Mrs. Houlton, who wrote under her maiden name, Peggy Mann, was honored as one of the nation's foremost authors of books and articles about preventing drug abuse. Her ''Marijuana Alert'' (1985), about drug-abuse prevention for adults, was based on an article she wrote for the Reader's Digest in 1979.         Many of Mrs. Houlton's books were for teen-agers and younger children. These include ''Arrive Alive: How to Keep Drunk and Drugged Drivers Off the Road'' and ''Twelve Is Too Old,'' a novel about tobacco and marijuana.         Mrs. Houlton was born in Manhattan, and was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin. Her first novel for adults, ''A Room in Paris,'' which was published in 1955, is about the lives and loves of a young American art student in France.         A TV Special         Some of her other books include ''Golda,'' a biography of Golda Meir, the former Prime Minister of Israel; ''The Last Escape,'' about a woman's mission to smuggle Jews out of Nazi-occupied Europe into Palestine; ''My Dad Lives in a Downtown Hotel,'' and ''The Street of the Flower Boxes.'' ''The Street of the Flower Boxes'' inspired an NBC television special in the 1970's that won a Peabody Award and that inspired a movement for neighborhood beautification.         The National Federation of Parents for Drug-Free Youth recently established the Peggy Mann Scholarship Award for Outstanding Youth Involved in Substance-Use Prevention. Beginning next year, annual $1,000 college scholarships are to be given to students from each of the 50 states, Guam and Puerto Rico who have made distinguished contributions to their community and school-based drug-prevention programs.         She is survived by her husband, William, and two daughters, Jenny and Betsy Houlton, all of New York City and Fair Harbor, L.I.; a brother, John Mann of Conesus, N.Y., and her mother, Edna Mann of New York City.         Funeral services are to be held today at 10:30 A.M. at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street.       
        Mildred Scott Olmsted, a longtime antiwar campaigner who was national executive director of a leading pro-disarmament group, died Monday at her home in Rose Valley, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. She was 99 years old.         Mildred Scott Olmsted, a longtime antiwar campaigner who was national executive director of a leading pro-disarmament group, died Monday at her home in Rose Valley, Pa., a suburb of Philadelphia. She was 99 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Ann Ivey, a colleague.         For 20 years, starting in 1946, Mrs. Olmsted led the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, formed at The Hague in 1915. She was also active in the women's suffrage movement from the early 1900's, and later in life became active in the civil rights movement.         In 1961 she began a series of exchange seminars between the United States section of the league and the Women's Committee of the Soviet Union, a group sponsored by the Soviet Government.         Two months ago Mrs. Olmsted received a lifetime achievement award from the City of Philadelphia, and in 1986 she received the women's league's Peace and Freedom Award.         She was born in Glenolden, Pa., and graduated from Smith College in 1912. In World War I she was a social worker with the Y.W.C.A. in France and Germany. In France she met Jane Addams, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and first president of the women's league, whose example inspired Mrs. Olmsted to work for peace.         Her husband, Allen Olmsted, a Pennsylvania judge who was a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, died in 1976.         Mrs. Olmsted is survived by a son, Anthony, of West Goshen, Pa.; a daughter, Enid Burke, of Springfield, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and two great- grandchildren.       
        Bertha Lindsay, the last surviving eldress of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming, known as the Shaker Society, died Wednesday at her home at Shaker Village in Canterbury, N.H. She was 93 years old.         Bertha Lindsay, the last surviving eldress of the United Society of Believers in Christ's Second Coming, known as the Shaker Society, died Wednesday at her home at Shaker Village in Canterbury, N.H. She was 93 years old.         She apparently died of a stroke, said Dr. Scott Swank, director of the village.         Sister Ethel Hudson, who is 94, is now the last of a community of Shakers in Canterbury that once numbered 400 men, women and children. The community, founded in 1792, was a communal society of shared property; followers were devoted to celibacy, living simply and pacifism. The Shakers in Canterbury once owned about 4,000 acres, most of which is being preserved. About 690 acres remain, and efforts are under way to have that too remain free of development.         There is one other Shaker community in the country, in Sabbathday Lake, Me. It has four covenanted members and four others who follow the Shaker practices.         History of Sect         The Shakers, who included free-form and choreographed dance in their worship, were an offshoot of the Shaking Quakers from England. They are thought to have derived their name from a belief that shaking from religious fervor was a manifestation of inner spiritual experience.         Miss Lindsay came to Canterbury in 1905 as an orphan. She lost her sight when she was 90 years old and put her remaining energies into making audio recordings about the history of the movement. ''I want people to know we did have fun and plenty of it,'' she said in an interview.         She is survived by a niece.       
         Jacqueline Schwartzman, a community leader in the Chelsea section of Manhattan for many years, died on Thursday at her home in Chelsea. She was 71 years old.         She had undergone exploratory surgery four weeks ago, but the cause of death is not known, said her husband, Dr. Isidore Schwartzman.         Mrs. Schwartzman, who was born in Chelsea, was an early member of the block association movement in New York City in the 1950's and was the first president of the West 22d Street Association. She was a founder and past president of the Chelsea Independent Democrats.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Leslie Blake and Cheryl Bulbach, both of Manhattan; two sons, Stephen Short of Manhattan and Dr. Wayne Blackmon of Washington, and two grandchildren.       
         Vijay Lakshmi Pandit, an Indian independence fighter, diplomat and politician, and the first woman to serve as President of the United Nations General Assembly, died today in the northern town of Dehra Dun. She was 90 years old.         Mrs. Pandit, the sister of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the virtual chief of one of Asia's most important political dynasties, which included Mr. Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, who was Prime Minister for 13 years, and Mrs. Gandhi's son Rajiv, who succeeded his mother in 1984 and served until 1989.         President Ramaswami Venkataraman described Mrs. Pandit today as a "luminous strand in the tapestry of India's freedom struggle." "Distinctive in her elegance, courage and dedication, Mrs. Pandit was an asset to the national movement," he continued.         Frail with age and ailing for some time, Mrs. Pandit had not been poltically active for several years. She moved from New Delhi to Dehra Dun in 1970. But in 1977, outraged by the authoritarian state of emergency imposed from 1975 to 1977 by Indira Gandhi, she campaigned actively against her niece. A popular revolt led to electoral defeat for Mrs. Gandhi, who reportedly never forgave her aunt for her outspoken role.  Ambassador to Moscow         Mrs. Gandhi and Mrs. Pandit were also cool to each other because of what Mrs. Gandhi viewed as her aunt's condescension toward her mother. Kamala Nehru, Mrs. Gandhi's mother, came from a middle-class Kashmiri Brahmin family and married into the rich, aristocratic Nehru family. Accounts of the time say that she never quite adjusted to the change in lifestyle and was often lonely.         Mrs. Pandit, whose husband died in the 1940's, took part in the Indian freedom movement and was arrested several times by the British colonial authorities.         Her brother appointed her as Ambassador to Moscow when India became independent in 1947. She then held a succession of high positions, including ambassadorships to the United States and Britain and, in 1953, presidency of the United Nations General Assembly. She also led the Indian mission to the United Nations.         At home, she was elected a lawmaker two times and served as Governor of the western state of Maharashtra. She retired from public life in 1970 but later served as the Indian representative to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.         She is survived by three daughters, including the novelist Nayantara Sehgal.       
         Alice Marble, a Californian who grudgingly gave up baseball and grew into America's No. 1 female tennis player by winning the United States women's amateur singles title four times between 1936 and 1940, died yesterday at Desert Hospital in Palm Springs, Calif. Miss Marble, a longtime resident of Palm Desert, Calif., was 77 years old.         Miss Marble, who suffered from pernicious anemia, according to her sister-in-law, Bernice Marble of San Francisco, was admitted to the hospital on Saturday and died at 1:35 A.M. yesterday. A hospital spokesman, Randy Bevilacqua, gave no cause of death.         To achieve her stature as the golden-haired queen of women's tennis, Miss Marble had to overcome obstacles. Born on Sept. 13, 1913, in the lumber town of Beckwith in the Sierra Nevadas, she left with her parents and three brothers at the age of 5 to grow up in San Francisco, a chubby girl athlete, adept at boxing, baseball and basketball. Turned to Tennis at 15         Her athletic skills were not turned to tennis until the age of 15. The former Little Queen of Swat learned the game quickly in Golden Gate Park. After winning many junior tournaments in California, her progress was slowed in 1933 by a case of sunstroke after she played 108 games of tennis in one day at East Hampton, L.I.         Then, in 1934, she suffered a complete collapse during a French-American series of matches at Roland Garros Stadium in Paris, which led to a diagnosis of pleurisy. She required a year of rest in a sanitarium, causing her to miss most of the 1934 and 1935 seasons.         When she applied to play in the national amateur championship at Forest Hills in 1936, the tournament committee refused to accept her entry, saying she was unfit to play and might permanently jeopardize her health. But after practicing a week, Miss Marble persuaded the committee to accept her entry and she went on to win her first national championship. Ranked No. 1 in 1936-1940         As the No. 1-ranked woman from 1936 to 1940, she dominated the game. She won the United States singles title again in 1938, 1939 and 1940 and the women's singles at Wimbledon in 1939.         With Sarah Palfrey Fabyan she won the United States women's doubles championships from 1937 through 1940 and the mixed-doubles title with Gene Mako in 1936, with Donald Budge in 1938, with Harry Hopman in 1939 and with Bobby Riggs in 1940. At Wimbledon, she also won the women's doubles in 1938 and 1939 with Mrs. Fabyan and the mixed doubles with Budge in 1937 and 1938 and with Riggs in 1939.         In 1939, she had won the singles, women's doubles and mixed doubles at both Forest Hills and Wimbledon and in 1940 she was undefeated. As a member of four winning Wightman Cup teams in matches against Britain during the 1930's she lost only one match in singles and one in doubles. Aided by a Coach         After her illness, Miss Marble was aided by the coaching of Eleanor Tennant, who made changes in her strokes. Miss Marble played an all-out athletic game complete with strong volleys and smashes. She was also adept at the twist serve and possessed a strong backhand. She was unusually quick on her feet and used her speed to good advantage while attacking the net.         Jack Kramer, a member of the Tennis Hall of Fame, said yesterday of Miss Marble: "She was the lady who most changed the style of play for women. She introduced the aggressive and athletic style that has led down to the female stars of today like Billie Jean King, Martina Navratilova and Steffi Graf."         "Alice Marble was a picture of unrestrained athleticism," said Billie Jean King. "She is remembered as one of the greatest women to play the game because of her pioneering style in power tennis. I also admired her tremendously because she always helped others." Became a Pro After 1940         After her conquests of 1939 and 1940, Miss Marble renounced her amateur standing and turned professional. Since there were no professional tournaments for women, she played a series of exhibitions until the outbreak of World War II, when she enlisted in the Hale America movement to assist in improving the physical condition of women and youngsters.         She also played exhibition tennis matches to entertain servicemen and to promote the sales of war bonds. She was inducted into the Lawn Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I., in 1964 with Donald Budge, her former mixed-doubles partner.         In 1946 she published a book "The Road to Wimbledon." She said she wrote it "because of so many requests from friends and fans who asked me to tell them the secret of success." Autobiography to Be Published         After the war, she continued to play exhibition matches and give tennis clinics in the United States and abroad. She also designed sportswear and traveled as a lecturer.         Her autobiogrpahy, "Courting Danger," written with Dale Leatherman, is scheduled for publication in June 1991, by St. Martin's Press.         In it, according to Miss Leatherman, Miss Marble writes of her marriage to Joe Crowley, an Army pilot who was shot down and killed over Germany during World War II. She also told of accepting an assignment as a spy for Army Intelligence in 1945 to gather information in Switzerland about German financial accounts. During the operation, she was shot in the back, but was rescued by her military intelligence contact and recovered. She was told not to mention the operation to anyone after the war.         Asked at a news conference in 1984 if she had any regrets about her tennis career, Miss Marble said, "I did not get to see myself on television and I did not get to play the tie breaker."       
         Tamara De Treaux, the actress who played the role of the lovable alien in the Oscar-winning film "E.T., the Extra-Terrestrial," died on Wednesday.  She was 31 years old.         Miss De Treaux died of respiratory and heart problems at the Medical Center of North Hollywood, said a friend, Ken Maley.         The 31-inch-tall actress started her career in San Francisco theaters and joined a singing group called the Medflies in 1980. Steven Spielberg spotted her during a Medflies performance in Los Angeles and hired her to take on the role of the earthbound alien in "E.T." after the original actor was injured. Miss De Treaux played the creature in scenes that required movement, and a robot was used in close-ups.         Miss De Treaux also appeared in the movies "Ghoulies" and in "Rockula." She recently completed filming "Love in Venice" and "The Linguine Incident."         She is survived by her mother, Barbara Detro, a brother and a sister.
