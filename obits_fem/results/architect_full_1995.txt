         Claire K. Tholl, whose recommendation to preserve more than 200 stone houses led New Jersey and the Federal Government to include many of them on a list of protected historic buildings, died on Monday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. She was 69 and lived in Upper Saddle River, N.J.         She suffered a lengthy illness, her family said.         Mrs. Tholl was trustee emeritus of the Bergen County Historical Society, a title created for her. She also had been a member of the county's Historic Site Advisory Board since 1969. It was for the board that she conducted a survey of sandstone structures dating as far back as the 1600's.         "The board decided that our stone houses were being threatened with demolition, so funding was acquired and she did the stone house survey in 1979 and 1980," Ruth Van Wagoner, director of the county Office of Cultural and Historic Affairs, said yesterday. "More than 200 were placed on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places, and about 190 were placed on the National Register."         Among the buildings shielded as a result of the survey by Mrs. Tholl was the 282-year-old Steuben House, a mansion of Bergen County sandstone in Dutch Colonial style in River Edge. The mansion was used as a headquarters by George Washington in 1780 and was given to Gen. Friedrich von Steuben as a reward after the Revolutionary War as a reward for being Washington's drillmaster. It was saved by the state from demolition in 1928 through eminent-domain proceedings.         A native of Hackensack, Claire Koch Tholl studied engineering and naval designing at Stevens Institute of Technology and graduated in architecture from Cooper Union in 1947.         She began her historic research in 1944, after working as a draftsman and in boat design, technical illustration and cartography. She later added architectural photography to her interests.         By 1960 she was studying old houses. She advised the restorers of Steuben House, Old Stone Church in Saddle River and Ringwood Manor in Ringwood, among many others.         She also was knowledgeable about early cooking methods and utensils and the kind of foods favored in the past, and the farms that produced them. For the Bicentennial year 1976 she wrote about the foods of the past in the introduction of an illustrated collection of regional and historic recipes.         Mrs. Tholl is survived by two daughters, Lisanne Fogel of Bellingham, Mass., and Andrea Dente of Vernon, N.J.; two sons, Robert, of Morristown, N.J., and James, of Queensbury, N.Y., and five grandchildren. Her husband, Edward, an architect, died in 1967.       
         Edith Ferry Hooper, a philanthropist who supported art and educational institutions in Baltimore, died on May 27 at the Brightwood Retirement Community in Brooklandville, near Baltimore. She was 85 and lived until recently in North Baltimore.         Mrs. Hooper was born and reared in Grosse Pointe, Mich., the daughter of Dexter Mason Ferry, an insurance executive who was the founder of the Ferry Seed Company, and Jeanette Hawkins. She was a graduate of Vassar College.         In the late 1930's and early 40's, she worked at the Detroit Institute of Arts and at the Museum of Modern Art in New York. After her marriage in 1945 to Arthur Upshur Hooper, a Baltimore lawyer who died in 1970, she became involved with the Baltimore Museum of Art. She was board president of the museum from 1973 to 1975, a trustee from 1957 to 1977 and an honorary trustee until her death.         Because of her intense interest in modern art, which she collected, a wing of the Baltimore museum was named after her 1981. For several years it housed her gifts of photographs, drawings, sculptures and paintings by Picasso, Ellsworth Kelly and Jasper Johns.         Mrs. Hooper was the president of the Bryn Mawr School in North Baltimore, a private school for girls, from 1963 to 1970. She also headed the building program of its lower school, which she persuaded Marcel Breuer, the Hungarian-born New York architect, to design. Earlier, Mr. Breuer had built and expanded two of her homes.         She is survived by three daughters, Kate Hooper Gorman of Piermont, N.Y.; Jeanette Williams of Mount Washington, Md., and Queene Hooper Foster of Manhattan; a brother, Dexter Ferry of Detroit, and six grandchildren.       
         Maggie Keswick, a Scots-born connoisseur of China and its sensuous, mysterious gardens, died on July 8 in London. She was 53 and had homes in London, Santa Monica, Calif., and Wellfleet, Mass.         The cause was breast cancer, said John Taylor Williams of Palmer & Dodge, the family's legal counsel in Boston.         Margaret Keswick Jencks hailed from a family that has lived and done business in China for nearly 140 years. She was born in Cowhill, Scotland, but spent much of her early life in post-revolutionary China.         She became known in the United States with the appearance of her book "The Chinese Garden" (1978), which was richly embellished by her own photography.         "Miss Keswick's is no ordinary garden tour," a reviewer for The New York Times wrote, "but a first-rate job of intellect, intelligently illustrated."         The book was reissued in paperback by St. Martin's Press in 1986 and remains in print.         Miss Keswick's father, Sir John Keswick, was a major trader at the head of the Scottish company Jardine Matheson. He spoke Chinese and became a trusted friend of Zhou Enlai, Mao Zedong's most influential advisor.         In 1982, she edited "The Thistle and the Jade," a history of Jardine Matheson on its 150th anniversary. She also contributed to the "Oxford Garden Companion" and to books by her husband, Charles Alexander Jencks, a post-modernist architect and professor at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Architecture.         For many years she was the chairwoman of the Keswick Foundation, based in Hong Kong. She established the first cancer hospice there and extended the foundation's work to China. Most recently she created a cancer-care center in Edinburgh, where she was undergoing hospital treatment.         She was educated at Oxford University, where she studied Middle English, and at the Architectural Association in London. After "The Chinese Garden" was published, she lectured widely in the United States.         She was also in demand as a garden designer, collaborating with Frank Gehry, the architect, and Claes Oldenburg, the artist.         She is survived by her husband; a son, John; a daughter, Lily Clare; two stepsons, Cosmo and Justin Jencks, all of London, and her mother, Clare Lady Keswick of Portrack, Scotland.       
         Florene May Schoenborn, a benefactor and life trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, to which she gave dozens of paintings collected over the years by her and her second husband, Samuel A. Marx, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         The couple came to own what was among the most distinguished collections of modern art in private hands. The collection included the most outstanding collection of early works by Matisse outside Russia, the museum said.         Mrs. Schoenborn became a museum trustee in 1953 and served on the program and drawing comittees. She was a founding member of the museum's international council in 1954.         She was born in Denver. Her father was David May Sr., the founder of May Department Stores, who started his chain in Leadville, Colo. As a young woman, she hoped to study journalism at Columbia University but her father would not permit her to attend.         Forty-four of her paintings were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in a 1965 exhibition, "The School of Paris: Paintings From the Florene May Schoenborn and Samuel A. Marx Collection." Mr. Marx, a successful Chicago architect, died in 1964.         Mrs. Schoenborn donated many important paintings, drawings, sculptures and prints to the museum. The core of her contributions consisted of five paintings by Matisse: "Moroccan Garden" (1912), "Woman on a High Stool" (1914), "Artist and Goldfish" (1914), "Variation on a Still Life by De Heen" (1915) and "The Moroccans" (1915).         The gallery showing Matisse works from the museum's permanent collection was named the Florene May Schoenborn Gallery in 1986.         Her first marriage, to Martin Straus, an advertising executive, ended in divorce. Her third husband, Wolfgang Schoenborn, a developer who helped to turn the old Pacific port of Acapulco into a fashionable resort, died in 1986.         She is survived by five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 1, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Saturday about Florene May Schoenborn, a benefactor and life trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, misstated the number of paintings she gave to the museum. Her gifts included five paintings by Matisse and drawings, sculptures and prints by many other artists, not dozens of paintings.       
         Vera Maxwell, one of a legendary group of American sportswear designers who came to prominence in the 1940's, died on Sunday in Rincon, P.R., at the home of her grandson, Douglas Maxwell.         She was 93 and died after a brief illness, said her daughter-in-law, Rhea Maxwell.         One of the pioneers of women's sportswear along with Claire McCardell, Clare Potter, Carolyn Schnurer and Tina Leser, Vera Maxwell continued to design clothes that were casual, comfortable and classic until her retirement in 1985.         Among her innovations was the "weekend wardrobe" of 1935 that consisted of two jackets, two skirts and a pair of trousers; the wraparound jersey blouse; the riding jacket suit and the fencing suit. In the 1940's she designed a cotton coverall uniform for war workers at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation that was a forerunner of the jump suit. She was also the first American designer to make clothes of Ultrasuede.         She won the Coty American Fashion Critics' Award in 1953 and was honored in 1970 with a retrospective exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. In 1980 there was another retrospective, this time at the Museum of the City of New York, which opened with a party attended by Princess Grace of Monaco and her daughter Princess Caroline. Mrs. Maxwell had met the former Grace Kelly in Dallas in 1955 when they were both there to receive Neiman Marcus Awards, and she frequently visited her and Prince Rainier in Monaco.         Born Vera Huppe in New York City on April 22, 1901, of Viennese parents, she traveled to Europe with them as a child and lived for a while in Vienna. She attended high school in Leonia, N.J., and studied ballet in New York, becoming a member of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1919. She danced with the company until her marriage in 1924 to Raymond J. Maxwell, who worked on Wall Street. They were divorced in 1937. She married Carlisle H. Johnson, an architect, in 1938 and divorced him in 1945.         While married to Mr. Maxwell, she had started to model on Seventh Avenue and developed an interest in making clothes. She studied tailoring in London and worked as a designer for several American sportswear houses including Adler and Adler, Glenhunt and Max Milstein. (In 1970, Mrs. Maxwell formed a business partnership with Mr. Milstein's nephew Morton Milstein.)         Mrs. Maxwell became known as a designer in the 1930's when American fashion was struggling to be born and most designers toiled anonymously. She achieved fame with such designs as a weekend wardrobe of a collarless jacket with four patch pockets that she made in tweed and in gray flannel to be mixed and matched with a short pleated flannel tennis skirt, a longer tweed skirt with pressed-down pleats and a pair of flannel cuffed trousers -- all designs so classic they could still be worn today.         Following the precepts of her idol, Coco Chanel, Mrs. Maxwell devoted herself to making timeless clothes that women could move around in. In 1975, she showed what she called a "speed suit," which was actually a pull-on dress with a stretch top and no zippers, buttons, snaps or ties. A woman could slip it on in seconds.         After years of designing for other manufacturers, Mrs. Maxwell founded her own company, Vera Maxwell Originals, in 1947. Her heyday was in the 1950's when her easy-to-wear styles attracted customers like Pat Nixon, Martha Graham and Lillian Gish. By 1960 her clothes were being sold in 700 stores around the country. In the 60's, her star waned as fashion's attention shifted to swinging London designers like Mary Quant and Zandra Rhodes.         In 1964, Mrs. Maxwell showed a collection of American Indian-inspired clothing that failed to find an audience. "It bombed," she said in an interview that appeared in The New York Times in 1970. "So I decided to lie fallow for a while."         She resurfaced in 1970 with a collection that was introduced at a tea in B. Altman's. Until her retirement, she continued to turn out the tasteful classic suits, coats and dresses that her loyal customers would wear for years.         She made a brief comeback as a consultant to a knitwear company but spent most of her time working on her memoirs. They have never been published, her daughter-in-law said, partly because "people wanted gossip about Grace Kelly, but she wouldn't write that."         She sold her Manhattan apartment three years ago and retired to Gilgo Beach, L.I., with her son, Dr. R. John Maxwell, and daughter-in-law and spent winters in Rincon with them and her grandson. She is also survived by her granddaughter, Sarah Maxwell of Santa Fe, N.M., and a great-granddaughter, Isabel Maxwell.
