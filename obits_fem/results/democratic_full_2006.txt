         Elizabeth A. Connelly, a New York State assemblywoman from Staten Island for 27 years who was a leader in the fight against drunken driving, died yesterday at her home in the Westerleigh section of the borough. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Robert, said.         Mrs. Connelly, who retired in 2000, was the Assembly's chief sponsor of the 1982 law that raised the state's legal drinking age from 18 to 19; it has since been raised to 21. She was also a co-author of the law requiring judges to suspend the driver's license of anyone convicted of drunken driving.         When she retired, she was the speaker pro tempore of the Assembly, the highest rank a woman had ever reached there, and regularly presided over contentious debates.         Sometimes describing herself as a conservative Democrat, Mrs. Connelly sponsored legislation in the 1980's that would have ended state Medicaid financing for abortions. The measure failed.         Born Elizabeth Ann Keresey on June 19, 1928, Mrs. Connelly was a Brooklyn native whose family moved to the Bronx when she was 2. She did not attend college. In the mid-1940's, she worked as a secretary at the New York Life Insurance Company. Then, from 1946 to 1954, she worked in telephone sales for cargo at Pan American World Airways, with her future husband as her boss.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Connelly is survived by a son, Robert Jr. of Las Vegas; three daughters, Alice Lanzi of Staten Island, Margaret Nicholson of Katonah, N.Y., and Therese Shannon of Goshen, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.         The Connellys moved to Staten Island in 1954, and Mrs. Connelly became active in local politics, joining the North Shore Democratic Club of Richmond County. She was first elected to the Assembly in 1973 and was re-elected 13 times.         In 1977, Mrs. Connelly was appointed chairwoman of the Assembly Committee on Mental Health, Mental Retardation, Developmental Disabilities, Alcoholism and Substance Abuse.         ''A family member suffered from mental illness,'' her husband said yesterday, ''and that's why she dedicated herself to that cause.''         Mrs. Connelly was also a co-sponsor of a 1994 bill calling for the secession of Staten Island from New York City. The effort stalled after the Assembly's Democratic leadership said they believed the State Constitution required that such a measure be requested by the city, not one of its boroughs.       
         Evelyn Dubrow, organized labor's most prominent lobbyist at the time of its greatest power in her four decades with the nation's largest apparel union, died on Tuesday in Washington. Family members said she was 95.         She died at George Washington Hospital after several days in a coma, said Jay Mazur, former president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, now part of Unite Here.         Just 4 feet 11 inches tall and famed for working 15-hour days, Ms. Dubrow was one of the most colorful and respected lobbyists in Washington, and one of the first powerful women among them. One fellow lobbyist called her ''the little engine that could.''         Sometimes she visited 30 senators in a day. She said she trudged so many miles around Capitol Hill that she wore out 24 pairs of her Size 4 shoes each year.         David Dubinsky, the legendary president of the International Ladies' Garment Workers Union, named Ms. Dubrow the union's chief Washington lobbyist in 1956, once saying that she was the girl who should represent all the girls in the union.         Tireless and an eloquent speaker, she was a powerful voice for labor and for social legislation, including Medicare, school spending and civil rights.         At a signing ceremony in 1965 for the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, President Lyndon B. Johnson singled out Ms. Dubrow, saying she deserved credit for pushing through the legislation.         Although he was just as conservative as Ms. Dubrow was liberal, Barry Goldwater, the Republican presidential candidate in 1964, was friendly with Ms. Dubrow, once telling Mr. Dubinsky, ''That's a smart little girl lawyer you've got down here.'' She was not a lawyer, however.         She was so well liked and such a fixture on Capitol Hill that House Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. assigned her a chair among the Congressional doorkeepers' chairs outside the House of Representatives so she would not have to stand all day while waiting to buttonhole arriving or departing House members. She was the only lobbyist to have such a seat.         ''Lobbyists tend to work for, or even become, fat cats,'' Ms. Dubrow said in a 1997 interview with Washingtonian Magazine. ''Well, I'm not. And I don't. I work for more than 350,000 union members and 250,000 retirees. They're far from fat cats. They're hard-working citizens who can't trot up to Capitol Hill and meet their representatives directly.''         She worked in Washington under presidents from Dwight D. Eisenhower through Bill Clinton. She won many battles, like raising the federal minimum wage to $1.15 an hour in 1961. But she often lost, failing, for example, to defeat the North American Free Trade Agreement under Mr. Clinton.         When Mr. Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1999 -- he towered over her as they hugged -- he said, ''A tenacious and effective union activist, she has been a force for social justice and improved labor conditions by working for increases in the minimum wage, health care reform, family and medical leave, and pay equity for women.''         In Ms. Dubrow's early years as a lobbyist, some senators asked her to baby-sit, among them the fathers of Al Gore, the former vice president, and Christopher J. Dodd, a Democratic senator from Connecticut.         She did not hide her disappointment that Republicans took control of Congress in the 1990's.         ''What most bothers me in this Republican Congress is how they make it seem a crime for anyone to be poor -- like the poor want to be poor,'' she said in a Washingtonian interview. ''Some of those folks on the Hill can't get it through their thick heads that as representatives in a democracy, they should care about the people who most need their help.''         Evelyn Dubrow -- known universally as Evy -- was born in Passaic, N.J., on March 6, 1911, relatives said; she left no immediate survivors. She graduated from New York University in the 1930's, having studied journalism there; she sometimes fudged dates to hide her age. She worked as a reporter for The Morning Call of Paterson, N.J.         Ms. Dubrow became secretary for the Textile Workers Union in New Jersey in the late 1930's and then assistant to the president of the state's C.I.O. council.         She said it was no surprise that she became active in labor and politics because her father, a carpenter, was a union man and Socialist émigré from Belarus while an older sister was once arrested in a suffragists' protest in front of the White House.         In 1948, she became New York State director for Americans for Democratic Action. She twice campaigned for Adlai E. Stevenson, who lost twice to Eisenhower, and afterward she became the garment workers' Washington lobbyist.         She attributed her lobbying success to what she called her BAT theory: ''I don't beg,'' she said. ''I don't assume I know all the answers, and I don't threaten.'' She explained that if lawmakers voted against labor's position, it was unwise to grow angry or threaten to defeat them because then they might never support labor again on any issue.         ''I've always told people, you need better feet than brains to lobby,'' she told Women's Wear Daily in 1988, adding that a sense of humor, a smile and a nonthreatening manner helped, too.         ''I have a theory,'' she added. ''I don't wear pants. Some men don't like women in pants.''       
         Victoria Jackson Gray Adams, a key figure in the struggle by Mississippi blacks to win their political and civil rights in the 1960's and the first woman to seek a seat in the United States Senate from her state, died Aug. 12 in Baltimore. She was 79.         Her death was announced by her son, the Rev. Cecil Conteen Gray of Baltimore.         Forty-two years ago, Mrs. Gray Adams, a teacher, door-to-door saleswoman of Beauty Queen cosmetics and leader of voter education classes from the hamlet of Palmers Crossing, on the edge of Hattiesburg, Miss., decided to take on Senator John C. Stennis, the Mississippi Democrat who at the time had been in the Senate for 16 years.         In July 1964, she announced that she and others from the tiny Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party would challenge the power of the segregationist politicians, like Mr. Stennis, who represented her state. The time had come, she said, to pay attention ''to the Negro in Mississippi, who had not even had the leavings from the American political table.''         That decision became a turning point for the civil rights movement and for the Democratic Party, which for most of its history had been profoundly influenced by all-white delegations from the South. From Hattiesburg, the waves of the civil rights movement ''swept quietly through the church world into politics,'' the author Taylor Branch wrote in ''Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years, 1963-65'' (Simon & Schuster, 1998).         Mrs. Gray Adams was defeated by a ratio of 30 to 1 in the Democratic primary, in part because Mississippi had effectively disenfranchised black voters. But the party she started and led went on to challenge the right of the all-white Mississippi delegation to represent her state at the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City.         ''We had women, men, African-Americans, whites,'' Mrs. Gray Adams said of the party in a 2004 interview for the Virginia Organizing Project, a grass-roots political group she helped found. ''We were going in the face of the Mississippi Democratic Party, which included some of the most powerful members of the U.S. Congress, to demand that we be recognized to have representation at the Democratic National Convention. It was wild.''         Millions of Americans watching on television saw Fannie Lou Hamer, the best known of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party's founders, tell the convention's credentials committee how she had been jailed and beaten for trying to register blacks to vote. ''Is this America?'' Ms. Hamer asked. The third founder of the party who sought to be seated as a delegate was Annie Devine.         The all-white Mississippi delegation walked out of the convention. It rejected a compromise proposal to give the integrated Freedom Democratic Party token representation on the floor. It was the beginning of the end of an old political tradition. In 1968, Mississippi seated an integrated delegation at the Democratic convention.         ''We really were the true Democratic Party,'' Mrs. Gray Adams said in the 2004 interview. In the end, she said, ''we accomplished the removal of the wall, the curtain of fear in Mississippi for African-Americans demanding their rights.''         She continued: ''We eliminated the isolation of the African-Americans from the political process. I believe that Mississippi now has the highest number of African-American elected officials in the nation. We laid the groundwork for that.''         Born on Nov. 5, 1926, in Palmers Crossing, the daughter of Mack and Annie Mae Ott Jackson, Mrs. Gray Adams was educated at Wilberforce University in Ohio, the Tuskegee Institute in Alabama and Jackson State College in Mississippi. She went on to serve as a campus minister at Virginia State University and to teach and lecture at schools, colleges and universities across the nation.         Her first marriage, to Tony Gray, produced three children, Georgie; Tony Jr., who died in 1997; and Cecil, and ended in divorce in 1964. Other survivors include her husband of 40 years, Reuben Earnest Adams Jr.; their son, Reuben III; a brother, Glodies Jackson; and eight grandchildren.         Mrs. Gray Adams said she learned in 1964 that there are two kinds of people in grass-roots politics, ''those who are in the movement, and those who have the movement in them.''         ''The movement is in me,'' she said, ''and I know it always will be.''       
         Ann W. Richards, the silver-haired Texas activist who galvanized the 1988 Democratic National Convention with her tart keynote speech and was the state's 45th governor until upset in 1994 by an underestimated challenger named George W. Bush, died Wednesday at her home in Austin. She was 73.         The cause was complications of esophageal cancer, a family spokeswoman, Cathy Bonner, said. Ms. Bonner said the illness was diagnosed in March.         A champion of civil rights for minorities, women and gay men and lesbians, Ms. Richards first ran for governor in 1990 calling for a ''New Texas'' that would offer more opportunity and power to those groups.         She went on to become one of the most effective in a long line of Texas progressives who vied for control of the state when it was largely a Democratic stronghold. But her defeat after one term was a strong signal that generations of Democratic dominance in Texas had ended.         If one Mr. Bush closed out her political career, another figured into her rise, as a target of her barbs. ''Poor George, he can't help it,'' Ms. Richards said at the 1988 Democratic convention in Atlanta, speaking about the current president's father, former President George Bush. ''He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.''         Her saucy, plain-spoken keynote address, borrowing from the great tradition of vernacular Southern oratory, was one of the year's political highlights. ''We're gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage,'' she said at one point.         The speech transformed her, then the Texas treasurer, into a national figure. And it made her, a mother of four, an admired champion of feminism. ''Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did,'' she told the national audience. ''She just did it backwards and in high heels.''         Her defeat in 1994, coming in a year of sweeping Republican success at the polls nationwide, did not dim her celebrity on the national stage. She continued to speak out on behalf of liberal causes, was a regular commentator on CNN and appeared in national advertising campaigns, including one for snack chips.         She also went to work as a senior adviser for the international law firm of Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand (now DLA Piper) and later for the public relations company Public Strategies. She also served on numerous boards of directors, including those of J. C. Penney, Brandeis University and the Aspen Institute.         Dorothy Ann Willis was born Sept. 1, 1933, an only child, in Lakeview, Tex. She graduated in 1950 from Waco High School, where she showed a special facility for debate and met her future husband, David Richards. In her junior year, she attended the Girls State mock government program in Austin and was one of two delegates chosen to attend Girls Nation in Washington.         Ms. Richards went on to enroll at Baylor University in Waco on a debate scholarship and married. After graduating, she and Mr. Richards moved to Austin, where she earned a teaching certificate at the University of Texas in 1955 and taught social studies for several years at Fulmore Middle School. She reared her four children -- Cecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen -- in Austin, and they were with her at home when she died, Ms. Bonner said.         Ms. Richards is also survived by eight grandchildren. Cecile Richards, who became president of Planned Parenthood this year, lives in New York; the other siblings live in Austin.         As a young woman, Ann Richards volunteered in several campaigns for governor: in 1958 for Henry B. Gonzalez and in 1952, 1954 and 1956 for Ralph Yarborough. She then helped Mr. Yarborough's senatorial campaign in 1957.         In the early 1960's, she and a handful of other young Democrats founded North Dallas Democratic Women in an effort to give more power to women in the party. ''The regular Democratic Party and its organization was run by men who looked on women as little more than machine parts,'' she said later.         In 1972, she ran her first campaign, helping elect to the Texas Legislature Sarah Weddington, who had successfully argued Roe v. Wade before the United States Supreme Court.         In 1976, Ms. Richards defeated a three-term incumbent to become a commissioner in Travis County, which includes Austin. She held the job for four years. She also began drinking heavily, becoming alcoholic and putting great strain on her marriage, she said later. The marriage ended in divorce.         After entering rehabilitation, she stopped drinking in 1980 and later said that the decision to seek help had saved her life and salvaged her political career.         ''I have seen the very bottom of life,'' she said. ''I was so afraid I wouldn't be funny anymore. I just knew that I would lose my zaniness and my sense of humor. But I didn't. Recovery turned out to be a wonderful thing.''         In 1982, she ran for state treasurer and received the most votes of any statewide candidate, becoming the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in 50 years. She was re-elected in 1986.         In 1990, when Gov. William P. Clements Jr., the first Republican governor of Texas since Reconstruction, decided not to run for re-election, Ms. Richards challenged a former governor, Mark White, in the Democratic primary and won. She went on to defeat the Republican candidate, Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher, in the general election after a brutal campaign.         As governor, among other achievements, she fulfilled her campaign promise to bring more blacks, Hispanics and women into public office. She appointed the first black regent to the University of Texas and installed the first blacks and women on the state's legendary police force, the Texas Rangers. She also pushed for tougher penalties for polluters and gained control of the state's insurance board in a drive to reduce the industry's influence over state government.         Ms. Richards oversaw an expansion of the state's prison system, increasing the space for prisoners by a third, and cracked down on the number of prisoners being paroled. She also instituted a major substance abuse program for prisoners and championed creation of the Texas lottery as a source of public school financing. She bought the first lotto ticket herself on May 29, 1992.         The same year, she was named chairwoman of the Democratic National Convention, which nominated Bill Clinton for president for the first time.         Two years later, she underestimated her young Republican challenger from West Texas, George W. Bush, going so far as to refer to him as ''some jerk.'' The comment drew considerable criticism. She later acknowledged that Mr. Bush had been more effective than she at ''staying on message'' and that he had made none of the mistakes that her campaign strategists had expected. She was beaten 53 percent to 46 percent.         Ms. Richards was a co-author of several books, including ''Straight from the Heart: My Life in Politics and Other Places'' (Simon & Schuster, 1989), with Peter Knobler, and ''I'm Not Slowing Down: Winning My Battle with Osteoporosis'' (Dutton, 2003), with Richard U. Levine, a doctor.         On her 60th birthday, she got a motorcycle license, an event that was commemorated in a cover photo in Texas Monthly showing Ms. Richards's head superimposed on the body of a woman in a fringed jacket atop a Harley-Davidson beneath the headline ''White Hot Mama.''         In recent years, Ms. Richards had worked to establish the Ann Richards School for Young Women Leaders, a public college preparatory school in Austin. It will open next year, giving priority to economically disadvantaged students. She was also a sought-after commentator and speaker whose observations had lost little of their tart humor since her national emergence two decades ago.         As she once explained, ''I learned early on that people liked you if you made them laugh.''         Correction:  September 16, 2006, Saturday  A picture caption yesterday with the obituary of Ann W. Richards, the former Texas governor, misstated the year she gave the keynote speech at the Democratic National Convention. It was 1988, not 1998.       
         Patricia Kennedy Lawford, who as a sister of President John F. Kennedy had a front row seat to history and forged new links between her brother's administration and Hollywood through her marriage to the actor Peter Lawford, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 82 and also had a home in Southampton, N.Y.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Melissa Wagoner, a spokeswoman for Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, Mrs. Lawford's brother.         Athletic, lithe and as poised as a princess, Mrs. Lawford is widely remembered as the Roman Catholic schoolgirl who dismayed her domineering father, Joseph P. Kennedy, the former ambassador to Britain, by marrying Mr. Lawford, a debonair British actor.         The marriage, in 1954, was the stuff of newsreels: some 3,000 spectators gathered outside St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Church on the Upper East Side.         The sixth of nine children born to Joseph Kennedy and Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald Kennedy, Mrs. Lawford, like her siblings, had a well-honed understanding of politics and of the power of appearances. As early as 1946, she campaigned for her brother John during his first run for Congress, organizing highly effective women's coffees in Boston and Cambridge neighborhoods. When he ran for president in 1960, she often substituted at events for his wife, Jacqueline Kennedy, who was pregnant.         The Lawfords strengthened John Kennedy's ties to the show business world of Hollywood and Las Vegas through Mr. Lawford's association with the ''Rat Pack'' of Frank Sinatra, Dean Martin, Sammy Davis Jr., Joey Bishop and Shirley MacLaine.         Mr. Sinatra threw his support behind Kennedy, and his hit song ''High Hopes,'' with lyrics by Sammy Cahn, became the Kennedy campaign song. At the opening of the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, Sinatra, Davis, Mr. Lawford and Ms. MacLaine helped lead the singing of ''The Star-Spangled Banner.''         Through the years, Mrs. Lawford was a close friend of Marilyn Monroe, Tennessee Williams and Sinatra, for whom she partly named her daughter Victoria Frances.         In 1966, after 11 years of marriage, Mrs. Lawford became the first Kennedy to file for a divorce. It was a highly publicized break, one that required Mrs. Lawford to establish residency in Idaho to circumvent New York's divorce laws of the time.         Afterward, Mrs. Lawford and her four children moved to New York, where she took on a busy social schedule, befriended artists and writers and became known as a generous benefactor of the arts. She was a familiar presence at benefit dinners, and her patronage would increase the cachet of any fund-raising event. Her name appeared regularly in the society columns of New York, the Hamptons and Palm Beach, Fla.         Patricia Kennedy was born on May 6, 1924, in Brookline, Mass., the fourth daughter of Joseph and Rose Kennedy and the granddaughter of John F. Fitzgerald, the popular mayor of Boston who had earlier served in the House of Representatives.         In the 1930's, while her father was ambassador to Britain, she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart at Roehampton, a boarding school for girls on the outskirts of London. When her family moved to Bronxville, N.Y., she attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart school in the Maplehurst section of the Bronx. (It later moved to Greenwich, Conn.) She attended Rosemont College in Pennsylvania, graduating in 1945.         Hers was a family that expected women to be graceful and well rounded while remaining in the background, quietly serving the ambitions of their men. Of the five Kennedy sisters, she was considered the most beautiful and sophisticated, with the aristocratic air of her mother. She was an accomplished athlete, but she never caught the family's legendary fire for competition.         In her 1987 book, ''The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys,'' Doris Kearns Goodwin wrote that Rose Kennedy was bothered by Patricia's lack of ambition. ''Although she had a good mind, a fine physique and a beautiful face which could easily have led her to excel in school,'' Ms. Goodwin wrote, ''in sports or in appearance, Rose contended 'she would never make the effort to achieve distinction' in any of these areas.''         But Mrs. Lawford's son, Christopher Lawford, wrote in his best-selling memoir, ''Symptoms of Withdrawal,'' published last year, that his mother had been resentful of her father for ''not being allowed fully to live up to her potential.''         In college she directed and acted in theater productions, and she pursued those interests after graduation, going to work as an assistant in the New York production department of NBC. She moved to Los Angeles to work as an assistant for Kate Smith's radio show and later for ''Family Theater,'' the radio program produced by the Rev. Patrick Peyton.         Much like her older sister Kathleen, who made her mother furious by marrying outside her church, Patricia disappointed her parents by marrying Mr. Lawford, a nominal Episcopalian who agreed to rear their children as Catholics.         Mrs. Lawford was the only Kennedy to move away from the family's traditional East Coast settings of Hyannis Port, Palm Beach and New York. She and Mr. Lawford settled into a sprawling oceanfront home in California once owned by Louis B. Mayer. The house became a recreation center for other family members; the president spent time lounging at his sister's pool when he was on the West Coast.         After the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963, Mrs. Lawford was often seen in the company of his widow and their two children, Caroline and John Jr. In 1986, she joined Senator Kennedy on an official visit to Chile that was marred by egg-throwing protesters angered by Mr. Kennedy's criticism of President Augusto Pinochet.         Mrs. Lawford devoted her energies to organizations that served the mentally disabled and to those helping people with substance abuse problems. She had a close personal appreciation for both causes: her older sister Rosemary, who died last year, was born mildly retarded and was lobotomized at 23; and she, Mr. Lawford and her son had waged their own battles with drugs and alcohol.         Mrs. Lawford's brother Robert, the former attorney general and later senator from New York, was closest to her in age, just 18 months younger. After his assassination in 1968, Mrs. Lawford assembled a privately printed book of reminiscences about him, as John had done for their oldest brother, Joe, who died in World War II.         The book, ''That Shining Hour,'' was published in 1969. Mrs. Lawford wrote in her introduction: ''This is not a sad book. Bobby was not a sad person. His basic shyness to the outside world gave way to fun, humor and wit whenever he was with the family.''         In addition to her brother Edward, Mrs. Lawford is survived by her son, Christopher, of California; three daughters, Sydney and Victoria Frances, both of Washington, and Robin, of New York; her sisters Jean Kennedy Smith and Eunice Kennedy Shriver; and 10 grandchildren.         In her last years, Mrs. Lawford led a relatively private life. She may have been a Kennedy, a woman with an instantly familiar name, but she did not crave attention and enjoyed walking the streets of Manhattan without being recognized.         Reprinted from yesterday's late editions.         Correction:  September 19, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary in some copies yesterday about Patricia Kennedy Lawford, a sister of President John F. Kennedy, misstated the location of her death. It was at her home in Manhattan, not her home in Southampton, N.Y. The article also erroneously included a survivor; her sister Rosemary Kennedy died last year. The obituary also misstated the place of residence of Mrs. Lawford's son, Christopher. He lives in California, not New York. A full obituary appears today on page B8.       
         Estelle R. Ramey, an endocrinologist, physiologist and feminist who came to national prominence in 1970 after she famously rebutted a Democratic leader who pronounced women unfit for important jobs because of the ''raging hormonal influences'' to which they were supposedly subject, died Friday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 89.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter, Drucilla Stender Ramey.         Professor Ramey was most recently emeritus professor of physiology and biophysics at the Georgetown University School of Medicine, where she had taught for many years.         The controversy arose in April 1970, at a session of the Democratic Party's Committee on National Priorities. Representative Patsy T. Mink of Hawaii had just urged the committee to make women's rights a major issue. She was challenged by a committee member, Edgar F. Berman, a retired surgeon and a confidant of Hubert H. Humphrey, the former vice president.         ''If you had an investment in a bank,'' Dr. Berman said, ''you wouldn't want the president of your bank making a loan under these raging hormonal influences at that particular period.''         He continued: ''Suppose we had a president in the White House, a menopausal woman president who had to make the decision of the Bay of Pigs?'' (He meant the Cuban missile crisis.)         Reading Dr. Berman's remarks, Professor Ramey was moved to action. She studied hormones for a living. She also had, as she would later say in interviews, ''a very sharp tongue.''         In a letter published in The Washington Star, she wrote, ''As an endocrinologist in good standing, I was startled to learn that ovarian hormones are toxic to brain cells.''         She went on to remind the public that during the Cuban missile crisis, the nation had a president who suffered from a severe hormonal imbalance: John F. Kennedy, who had Addison's disease, an endocrine disorder.         Her comments were widely reproduced, and Professor Ramey was soon in great demand in the news media and on the lecture circuit. Amid the furor over his remarks, Dr. Berman was forced to resign from the committee.         Estelle Rosemary Rubin was born in Detroit on Aug. 23, 1917, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Europe. The family moved to Brooklyn when she was a baby and, after her father died when she was an adolescent, their existence was threadbare.         After graduating from high school at 15, she earned a bachelor's degree in mathematics and biology from Brooklyn College in 1937; a master's in physical chemistry from Columbia in 1940 and a doctorate in physiology from the University of Chicago in 1950.         Before joining the Georgetown faculty in 1956, Professor Ramey taught at Queens College, the University of Tennessee and the University of Chicago. A founder and former president of the Association for Women in Science, she also was a past member of the President's Advisory Committee for Women.         Besides her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, James T. Ramey, whom she married in 1941; a son, James N., of Bethesda; a brother, Jack Rubin, formerly of Little Neck, N.Y.; and five grandchildren. Information on other survivors could not immediately be confirmed.         Throughout her research, which focused on the relationship between hormones and stress, Professor Ramey was struck again and again by the fact that men seem to be at a natural hormonal disadvantage: they are more inclined toward aggression, die sooner and are more prone to heart attacks and strokes.         As she often said in the popular press, ''Maleness is a biological risk factor.''         Dr. Berman, who helped propel Professor Ramey into the national spotlight, died in 1987, at 68, of a heart attack.       
         Ann W. Richards, the silver-haired Texas activist who galvanized the 1988 Democratic National Convention with her tart keynote speech and was the state's 45th governor until upset in 1994 by an underestimated challenger named George W. Bush, died Wednesday at her home in Austin. She was 73.         Ms. Richard died, surrounded by her four children, of complications from the esophageal cancer, the Associated Press reported.         Ms. Richards was the most recent and one of the most effective in a long-line of Lone Star State progressives who vied for control of Texas in the days when it was largely a one-party Democratic enclave, a champion of civil rights, gay rights and feminism. Her defeat by the future president was one of the chief markers of the end of generations of Democratic dominance in Texas.         So cemented was her celebrity on the national stage, however, that she appeared in national advertising campaigns, including one for snack chips, and was a lawyer and lobbyist for Public strategies and Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand.         ''Poor George, he can't help it,'' Ms. Richards said at the Democratic convention in 1988, speaking about the current president's father, former President George Bush. ''He was born with a silver foot in his mouth.''         Her acidic, plain-spoken keynote address was one of the year's political highlights and catapulted the one-term Texas governor into a national figure.         ''We're gonna tell how the cow ate the cabbage,'' she said, bringing the great tradition of vernacular Southern oratory to the national political stage in a way that transformed the mother of four into an revered icon of feminist activism.         Dorothy Ann Willis was born Sept. 1, 1933, in Lakeview, and graduated in 1950 from Waco High school where she showed a special facility for debate. She attended the Girl's Mock State government in Austin in her junior year and was one of two delegates chosen to attend Girl's Nation in Washington.         She attended Baylor University in Waco -- on a debate scholarship -- where she met her future husband, David Richards. After college, the couple moved to Austin where she earned a teaching certificate at the University of Texas in 1955 and taught social studies for several years at Fulmore Middle School.         She raised her four children in Austin.         She volunteered in several gubernatorial campaigns, in 1958 for Henry Gonzalez and in 1952, 1954 and 1956 for Ralph Yarborough and then again for Yarborough's senatorial campaign in 1957.         In 1976, Ms. Richards defeated a three-term incumbent to become a commissioner in Travis County, which includes Austin, and held that job for four years, though she later said her political commitment put a strain on her marriage, which ended in divorce.         She also began to drink heavily, eventually going into rehabilitation, a move that she later credited with salvaging her life and her political career.         ''I have seen the very bottom of life,'' she said. ''I was so afraid I wouldn't be funny anymore. I just knew that I would lose my zaniness and my sense of humor. But I didn't. Recovery turned out to be a wonderful thing.''         In 1982, she ran for state treasurer, received the most votes of any statewide candidate, became the first woman elected to statewide office in Texas in 50 years and was re-elected in 1986.         In 1990, when the incumbent governor, William P. Clements Jr., decided not to run for re-election, she ran against a former Democratic governor, Mark White, and won the primary, then later fought a particularly brutal campaign against Republican candidate Clayton Williams, a wealthy rancher, and won.         Among her achievements were institutional changes in the state penal system, invigorating the state's economy and instituting the first Texas lottery, going so far as to buy the first lotto ticket herself on May 29, 1992.         It was her speech to the Democratic convention in Atlanta, though, that made her a national figure.         A champion of women's rights, she told the television audience: ''Ginger Rogers did everything Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels.''         In 1992, she was chairwoman of the convention that first nominated Bill Clinton.         Two years later, she underestimated her young Republican challenger from West Texas, going so far as to refer to George W. Bush as ''some jerk,'' a commend that drew considerable criticism. Later, she acknowledged that the younger candidate has been much more effective at ''staying on message'' and made none of the mistakes that her campaign strategists had expected. She was beaten, 53 percent to 46 percent.         Her celebrity, however, carried her onto the boards of several national corporations, including J.C. Penney, Brandeis University and the Aspen Institute.         She also co-wrote several books, including ''Straight from the Heart: My Life in Politics and Other Places'' in 1989 with Peter Knobler and ''I'm Not Slowing Down'' in 2004, with Richard M. Levine.         On her 60th birthday, she got her first motorcycle license.         ''I've always said that in politics, your enemies can't hurt you, but your friends can kill you,'' Ms. Richard once said.         Survivors, according to The AP, include her children, Cecile, Daniel, Clark and Ellen Richards, and eight grandchildren.         Correction:  September 15, 2006, Friday  An obituary in some copies yesterday about former Gov. Ann Richards of Texas referred incorrectly to her later positions with the public relations company Public Strategies and the international law firm Verner, Lipfert, Bernhard, McPherson & Hand (now DLA Piper). She was an adviser to both, not a lobbyist and lawyer. She did not have a law degree. The obituary also misstated the middle initial of the co-author of her book ''I'm Not Slowing Down: Winning My Battle with Osteoporosis.'' He is Richard U. Levine, not Richard M. A full obituary appears today on Page A23.       
         Former Representative Helen P. Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho, an archconservative who ridiculed the Endangered Species Act and the protection of salmon in her own state and called for disbanding large parts of the federal government, died on Monday in a car accident in Nevada. She was 68.         Rocky Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Nevada Highway Patrol, said Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage, a passenger in a sport utility vehicle, died when it overturned on a remote northern Nevada highway about an hour's drive from her ranch in Monitor Valley, Nev., where she had moved five years ago.         She was traveling with her daughter-in-law, Yelena Hage, and Ms. Hage's 5-month-old son, Bryan Hage, who survived with minor injuries.         Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage was elected in 1994 as part of the Republican takeover of the House and served three terms, from 1995 to 2001, representing Idaho's First Congressional District.         She said she did not condone violence against the federal government, which militias and racial separatists in her largely rural district called for, but she had a reputation as a sagebrush rebel who sometimes sympathized with their causes.         She said she thought that the federal government asserted too much claim to Western land and resources and intruded on personal liberties. In a 1996 interview with The New York Times, she declared support for the South's position in the Civil War, as a ''state's rights issue.'' But she said she opposed slavery and would distance herself from racist groups and militias that regularly hailed her.         Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage received national attention for mocking the Endangered Species Act, saying it applied to white males, and, during her first campaign, in 1994, holding what she called endangered-salmon bakes. She served canned salmon and complained about the presence of Idaho salmon on the endangered species list.         Her suspicion of the federal government led her to advocate the elimination of the Education, Energy, Commerce and Housing Departments, and she accused Fish and Wildlife agents of harassing ranchers with helicopters. She later conceded she had little evidence of that.         As much as liberals and environmentalists loathed her -- ''Can Helen, Not Salmon'' went one bumper sticker -- supporters admired what they considered a principled, call-it-as-I-see-it manner.         She was born Helen Palmer in Topeka, Kan., on Jan. 27, 1938, grew up in Grants Pass, Ore., and attended Whitworth College in Spokane, Wash., before moving to the northern Idaho town of Orofino.         While at Whitworth, she met and married Nick Chenoweth, and they had two children, Mike and Meg Chenoweth-Keenan, of Boise, Idaho, who survive her, along with several grandchildren.         The couple divorced in 1975, and Mrs. Chenoweth moved to Boise, becoming active in politics and serving for a time as executive director of the Idaho Republican Party and then as chief of staff to Representative Steven D. Symms.         She scored an upset in the 1994 Republican primary over David H. Leroy, a former state attorney general, and went on to defeat the Democratic incumbent.         In 1999, she married Wayne Hage Sr., a Nevada rancher prominent in the movement to expand private property rights. He died in June.         Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage left office fulfilling a promise, in the spirit of the Contract With America's call for term limits, not to serve more than three terms.       
         Ellen Willis, the noted journalist, feminist and cultural critic, whose work ranged seamlessly through politics and religion, sex, film and rock 'n' roll, died yesterday at her home in Queens. She was 64.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Stanley Aronowitz, the well-known sociologist and progressive activist.         At her death, Ms. Willis was a professor of journalism at New York University. She also directed the journalism department's cultural reporting and criticism program, which she founded in 1995.         As a writer, she was best known for her political essays, which appeared in The Nation, Dissent and elsewhere. She was also widely recognized for her rock criticism: she was the first pop-music critic of The New Yorker, and wrote regularly about music for Rolling Stone, The Village Voice and other publications.         In addition, Ms. Willis was a vital figure in the women's movement of the late 1960s and afterward. She was a founder of Redstockings, a short-lived but highly influential radical feminist group begun in 1969. In the 1980s, she helped found No More Nice Girls, a street theater and protest group that focused on abortion rights.         At its core, Ms. Willis's work was rooted in the three R's, which for her were radicalism, religion and rock. But little escaped her scrutiny, and over the years, her writings embraced subjects as diverse as psychoanalysis, the O. J. Simpson trial, Monica Lewinsky and ''The Sopranos.'' To Ms. Willis, each of these was a strand in the contemporary social fabric, and her responsibility as critic was to map out the complex ways in which they interlaced.         In an essay in The New York Times in 1999, Ms. Willis wrote:         ''The Lewinsky scandal has prompted an impassioned national conversation on the relationship of the political to the personal, public authority to private behavior; on sexual privacy versus 'family values'; on female sexual autonomy and victimization. Granted, the affair has also produced an outpouring of schlock with no redeeming social value. But far from vindicating the eat-your-vegetables school of journalism, the schlock suggests what's wrong with it. Arguably, just as Victorian repression produced a thriving pornography industry, the exclusion of sex from 'serious' news media produced tabloidism. As this taboo passes into history, there should be more room for a public conversation on sex that is neither coy nor prurient, but simply frank.''         Though Ms. Willis liked to describe herself as an anti-authoritarian democratic socialist, she was leery of extremism of either stripe. An outspoken advocate of women's sexual empowerment, she also publicly condemned feminists who wanted to ban pornography. (She was disturbed by what she viewed as their Puritanism, and by the threat to free expression.) She also took some members of the American left to task for what she saw as anti-Semitism thinly veiled as political animus toward Israel.         ''My education was dominated by modernist thinkers and artists who taught me that the supreme imperative was courage to face the awful truth, to scorn the soft-minded optimism of religious and secular romantics as well as the corrupt optimism of governments, advertisers, and mechanistic or manipulative revolutionaries,'' Ms. Willis wrote in an essay collected in ''Beginning to See the Light: Pieces of a Decade'' (Knopf, 1981). She continued:         ''Yet the modernists' once-subversive refusal to be gulled or lulled has long since degenerated into a ritual despair at least as corrupt, soft-minded, and cowardly -- not to say smug -- as the false cheer it replaced. The terms of the dialectic have reversed: now the subversive task is to affirm an authentic post-modernist optimism that gives full weight to existent horror and possible (or probable) apocalyptic disaster, yet insists -- credibly -- that we can, well, overcome. The catch is that you have to be an optimist (an American?) in the first place not to dismiss such a project as insane.''         Ellen Jane Willis was born in Manhattan on Dec. 14, 1941; her father was a lieutenant in the New York Police Department. Reared in the Bronx and Queens, she earned a bachelor's degree in English from Barnard in 1962 and afterward did graduate work in comparative literature at the University of California, Berkeley.         Ms. Willis was divorced after an early marriage. She wed Mr. Aronowitz, her longtime companion, in 1998. She is survived by Mr. Aronowitz, a distinguished professor of sociology at the City University of New York and the Green Party candidate for governor of New York in 2002; their daughter, Nona Willis-Aronowitz, of Manhattan; two siblings, Michael Willis of Johannesburg, South Africa, and Penny Willis of Queens; four stepchildren, Michael O'Connell of Basking Ridge, N.J.; Kim O'Connell of Montclair, N.J.; Alice Finer and Hampton Finer, both of Brooklyn; and two step-grandchildren.         Ms. Willis's other books include ''No More Nice Girls: Countercultural Essays'' (University Press of New England, 1992); and ''Don't Think, Smile! Notes on a Decade of Denial'' (Beacon Press, 1999).         Despite her anti-authoritarian positions -- or perhaps because of them -- she confessed to being constitutionally hopeful, however unfashionable that might seem. In the essay from ''Beginning to See the Light'' she described the condition this way:         ''My deepest impulses are optimistic, an attitude that seems to me as spiritually necessary and proper as it is intellectually suspect.''       
         Ruth S. Morgenthau, a former professor of international politics at Brandeis University and an adviser to President Jimmy Carter on rural development in poor countries, died on Saturday in Boston. She was 75 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.         The death was confirmed by her daughter, Sarah Morgenthau Wessel.         An advocate of ''bottom-up'' aid to farmers and villagers in the third world, Mrs. Morgenthau was the Adlai Stevenson Professor Emeritus of International Politics at Brandeis, where she taught from 1963 to 2003. She also founded the university's graduate program in international sustainable development.         ''She combined academic expertise with a practitioner's reality and, in the process, became one of the acknowledged experts in the world on development issues,'' said Stuart E. Eizenstat, a senior official in the Carter and Clinton administrations. ''She really helped shape President Carter's thinking on making Africa a priority for his administration.''         In 1982, Mrs. Morgenthau and Robert Hecht, then a postdoctoral fellow at Brandeis, wrote an Op-Ed article for The New York Times asserting that the ''top-down'' approach to aid in Africa did not work because bureaucracies ''soak up resources.''         ''With the bottom-up approach,'' the article said, ''villagers' skills, tools and limited savings can be fully mobilized, and relatively small foreign aid contributions flow directly into rural communities.'' Mrs. Morgenthau put that approach to work as chairwoman of Pact, a coalition with aid programs in 20 nations.         Ruth Schachter Morgenthau was born in Vienna on Jan. 26, 1931. Her parents, Osias and Mizia Kramer Schachter, owned a textile importing company until they fled from the Nazis in 1940.         In addition to her daughter, of Montclair, N.J., Mrs. Morgenthau is survived by her husband of 44 years, Henry Morgenthau III, a television producer and author whose father was treasury secretary in the Roosevelt administration. She is also survived by two sons, H. Ben, of San Francisco, and Kramer, of Los Angeles; a sister, Alice Barzilay of Manhattan; and three grandchildren. Her brother-in-law, Robert M. Morgenthau, is the Manhattan district attorney.         Mrs. Morgenthau graduated from Barnard College in 1952, then attended the Institut d'Études Politiques in Paris as a Fulbright scholar. In 1958, she received a doctorate in politics from Oxford. In 1964, she wrote ''Political Parties in French-Speaking West Africa'' (Oxford University Press). She was a member of the United States delegation to the United Nations, and in 1988 ran unsuccessfully as a Democratic candidate for Congress in Rhode Island.         Last year, Mrs. Morgenthau was a member of a committee created by the Center for Global Development, a Washington research group, to assess the danger posed by poor nations. Mr. Eizenstat, who also worked on the committee, said she was a prime shaper of the report and had emphasized that aid was central to American security because poor nations were becoming havens for terrorists and criminals.         Correction:  November 14, 2006, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary on Sunday about Ruth S. Morgenthau, a scholar of international politics and a presidential adviser on aid to third world countries, misstated the date of her death. It was Nov. 4, not Saturday.
