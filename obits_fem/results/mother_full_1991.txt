         Jean Camper Cahn, a lawyer who helped establish Federal financing of legal services to the poor and was a co-founder of the now-defunct Antioch School of Law in Washington, died on Wednesday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 55 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband and law associate, Edgar S. Cahn.         Mrs. Cahn spent most of her career pursuing legal and social causes in Washington, where the Cahns lived for two decades until they moved to Florida in 1984.         In one of her latest cases, argued in a Federal District Court in Florida, a decision handed down a week before her death upheld her contention that money distributed under the Older Americans Act must be aimed at benefiting those in greatest need. A Family of Activists         Mrs. Cahn was born into a family of social activists. Her father, Dr. John E. T. Camper, a physician in Baltimore, was a founder of the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in that city, where she was born and reared.Regular visitors to the home included Thurgood Marshall, who was to become the first black Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and the singer Paul Robeson, who was her godfather.         While at Swarthmore College she met Mr. Cahn, a fellow student whose ancestors had been rabbis and lawyers for seven generations. The couple married in 1957 when she graduated and he was in graduate study of English at Yale.         Mrs. Cahn converted to Judaism and, at her husband's urging, applied for and won a scholarship to Yale Law School. Their elder son, Jonathan, was born on the day of her first examinations at law school, and their younger son, Reuben, was born a year later, while they were living and studying at Cambridge in England on a Fulbright fellowship.         Returning to New Haven, Mrs. Cahn served as associate general counsel for the New Haven Redevelopment Agency and in the country's first neighborhood legal services program, the Dixwell offices of Community Progress Inc., financed by the Ford Foundation. Joined War on Poverty         In 1964, during their final year in New Haven, the Cahns jointly wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal proposing a national system of legal services to the poor as part of what was to become the Johnson Administration's War on Poverty.         They moved to Washington that year, he to enter private law practice and she to take a post in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Mrs. Cahn was the first director of the National Legal Services Program in the O.E.O. and later founded the Urban Law Institute at George Washington University.         Mrs. Cahn attracted national notice in 1967 and 1968 as a lawyer for Adam Clayton Powell, a popular Harlem Congressman who was battling in court to reverse his 1967 expulsion from the House of Representatives for misuse of public funds and other transgressions. (The Congressman sat out the 90th Congress and subsequently won a special election and joined the 91st Congress in 1969. His expulsion was later found illegal by the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Powell died in 1972.)         In 1971 the Cahns co-founded the Antioch School of Law, which placed emphasis on serving the poor and trained prospective lawyers in social activism. Eight years later, Antioch College in Ohio, with which the school was initially affiliated, dismissed the Cahns as co-deans. The law school eventually became autonomous and, largely because of severe financial problems, it closed in 1988.         Mrs. Cahn continued to teach and to practice law. In 1984 she was a distinguished visiting professor at Middlebury College in Vermont, and in 1986 she was a distinguished visiting scholar at the London School of Economics. From 1986 until her death she was counsel to the Miami law firm of Fernandez-Caubi, Fernandez, Cancio & Allen.         In addition to Mr. Cahn, she is survived by their sons, Jonathan, a member of the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, and Reuben, a public defender in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; her mother, Florine Camper of Baltimore; two brothers, Nixon and John Camper, and three sisters, Elizabeth Jones, Mary Lou Redd and Ella Johns, all of Baltimore.       
         Elinor Cocheran Ayers, a former high school teacher who became a leading dog breeder, died on Wednesday at the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington. She was 62 years old and lived in Manchester, Vt. No cause of death was given.         Beginning in 1972, when she moved to Manchester and re-established the Seaward Kennels, which had been started by her mother in 1932, Miss Ayers became a major dog breeder. She specialized in American, Canadian Black and Landseer Newfoundlands.         Her greatest victory came in 1984 when Ch. Seaward's Blackbeard became the only Newfoundland ever to be named best in show at the Westminster Kennel Club's annual fixture at Madison Square Garden.         Before her dog-breeding career, Miss Ayers taught at the Ferry Hall School in Lake Forest, Ill., worked as a guidance counselor at Danbury (Conn.) High School and served as dean of girls at Montclair (N.J.) High School. She is survived by a brother, Stewart ayers, Of St. Petersburg, Fla.       
         Frances Arick Kolb, an education consultant who worked to shape public school curriculums that would encourage achievement by girls and minorities, died last Saturday at Marlborough Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 53 years old and lived in Marlborough.         Dr. Kolb died of breast cancer, said Max McConkey, director of The Network Inc., of Andover, Mass.         She had been associated with The Network, a nonprofit research and training organization since 1980. She was also associate director of the New England Center for Equity Assistance, a federally supported program to provide help to schools dealing with desegregation.         An advocate of textbooks reflecting the contributions of women and minorities, she was the producer of a video directed toward people of Hispanic descent, "Breaking Through -- Portraits of Winners." She also wrote several books including "Portraits of Our Mothers; Using Oral History in the Classroom" (The Network Inc., 1983).         She was a founder and former board member of the Pittsburgh chapter of the National Organization for Women.         Dr. Kolb was born in Worcester, Mass., and graduated in 1958 from Washington University in St. Louis. In 1972 she earned a Ph.D. in American history there.         She is survived by her husband, Alfred, professor of the humanities at Quinsigamond Community College in Worcester; her mother, Beth Arick of Brookline, Mass.; a daughter, Sharon Cohen, also of Brookline, and a brother, Martin R. Arick of Newton, Mass.       
         Princess Ileana of Romania, who was known as Mother Alexandra after becoming a nun, died at midday yesterday in St. Elizabeth Hospital Medical Center in Youngstown, Ohio, Mother Christophora, abbess of the Monastery of the Holy Transfiguration, said.         An aunt of former King Michael of Romania, she was 82 years old and had been a nun at the monastery, which is a community of nuns of the Orthodox Church in America in Ellwood City in western Pennsylvania, for 22 years.         Mother Alexandra, who founded the convent in 1968 and was its abbess from 1969 to 1980, fractured her hip in a fall there on Jan. 4, entered the hospital that night, suffered a massive heart attack on Jan. 8 and died of heart failure, Mother Christophora said.         She was born Jan. 5, 1909, the youngest of the five children of King Ferdinand and Queen Marie of Romania, and was a cousin of Queen Elizabeth II of Britain.  Brother Becomes King         Her eldest brother became King Carol II of Romania, and at his behest she was married in her early 20's to Archduke Anton of the Austrian Hapsburg dynasty and left Romania. She returned to her homeland in 1940 but was forced to leave in 1948 by the Communist Government.         She eventually came to the United States, carrying an heirloom diamond and sapphire tiara wrapped in a nightgown, and settled in Newton, Mass. She divorced the Archduke, who had served in the German Air Force during World War II, in 1954 and supported herself and her children by giving lectures on such topics as her life, Romania and world peace.         Her second marriage, to Dr. Stefan Issarescu, ended in divorce and then, with her children grown up, she became a nun of the Orthodox Church in the convent of the Protection of the Holy Virgin in Bussy-en-Othe in east-central France before going on to found the convent in Pennsylvania. After retiring as abbess at that convent, she continued an active life there and as a speaker on religious topics around the country.         She traveled to Romania in September, her first visit since 1948, to see the graves of her parents.  Author of Several Books         Her writings include a volume of memoirs, "I Live Again" (1952), and several books on spiritual and religious subjects including "Meditations on the Nicene Creed" (1958).         She is survived by three daughters from her first marriage, Alexandra, who lives in West Germany, and Magdalene and Elisabeth, who live in Austria; and two sons, Stefan, of Detroit, and Dominic, of Venice.         The former King Michael, who was ejected from Romania by the Communists shortly before Princess Ileana, now lives in Geneva.       
         Alberta Masiello, a longtime singers' coach at the Metropolitan Opera and a regular panelist in the Saturday afternoon Metropolitan Opera Quiz, died on Christmas Day at her Manhattan apartment. She was 75 years old.         Her physician, Dr. Sidney Goldstine, said she had been suffering from a long illness.         Miss Masiello was born in Milan, Italy, into a family of singers; her mother, Josephine La Puma, had a subsequent career with small opera companies in New York City. Trained as a pianist at the Milan conservatory, Miss Masiello moved to the United States with her mother in the late 1930's, where she studied further at the Juilliard School.         Gravitating to singing, she had a brief career as a mezzo-soprano, appearing in nightclubs during World War II and as Carmen and in other roles at the fledgling New York City Opera in the 1940's. But she soon devoted herself to vocal coaching, working privately in Manhattan and at the Chicago Lyric Opera in the 1950's before joining the Metropolitan in 1959.         Her initial title was rehearsal pianist, but in 1967 that was upgraded to assistant conductor, although she never conducted a performance at the Met. Her task was to prepare singers and accompany rehearsals of the mainstream Italian repertory. She retired from the Met in 1981.         Miss Masiello was best known for her frequent appearances on the Metropolitan Opera Quiz, an intermission feature of the Metropolitan's nationally broadcast Saturday matinee performances. There her store of knowledge and imperious manner beguiled listeners for more than 30 years, from her first appearance in 1959 as an accompanying pianist, to her last, in the spring of 1990.         There are no survivors.       
         Eleanor Stockstrom McMillen Brown, a leading interior designer and founder of McMillen Inc. one of this country's best-known design concerns, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100 years old.         Considered a pioneer in her field, she built her reputation on her ability to combine great style with a keen sense of business. Mrs. Brown went to both business and secretarial school after having studied design for three years at the Parsons School in New York and Paris. "I thought if I was going to do it at all, I'd better do it professionally," she once said. "That's why it's McMillen Inc. and not Eleanor McMillen. I wasn't one of the 'ladies.' "         Instead of working from her living room, as so many decorators have done when starting out, she took $13,000 of her own money and opened an office in a town house on East 55th Street.  'Strong-Minded Vision'         "Mrs. Brown was a great Victorian lady with amazing taste yet she had a clear, strong-minded vision," said Mark Hampton, the New York interior designer who worked for her for five years. "She knew how to keep other talented decorators working under the McMillen name."         Over the years her clients included H. H. Rogers of Standard Oil, Arthur Houghton of Corning Glass, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Field, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford 2d, Ambassador and Mrs. Kenneth Franzheim and Mrs. Charles W. Englehard Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Dillon, Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Aldrich and Mr. and Mrs. William S. Paley.         In 1963 she was selected to decorate portions of Blair House, the Federal Government's Washington guest house for foreign dignitaries. In the Johnson Administration, McMillen Inc. also decorated the President's private quarters in the White House. In 1952, Mrs. Brown was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government.         Mrs. Brown was born Eleanor Stockstrom in St. Louis. Her father, Louis Stockstrom, founded the American Stove Company. At 24, she married Drury McMillen, an engineer. They traveled extensively for 10 years and were later divorced.         In 1934 she married the architect Archibald M. Brown.         Between marriages, while she was at the Parsons School, she became close to two people who taught there: the antiques expert William Odom, who first taught her to appreciate fine French furniture and was known as her silent partner, and the designer Grace Fakes whose flair for architectural detail was to account for much of Mrs. Brown's reputation.  Valued Parsons Training         So greatly did she value the school's training that she served on its board and for 40 years hired only Parsons graduates.         She also had a reputation as a genius at furniture arrangements. "Mrs. Brown had that uncanny ability to look at a room and instantly tell exactly how to place the furniture and objects so everything just worked," said Stanley Barrows, the former head of the department of interior design at The Fashion Institute of Technology.         She also had a talent for creating a look that was at once restrained and elegant. French furniture carefully mixed with modern pieces was one of her signatures. "Her earliest work could best be described as stripped-down Directoire," Mr. Barrows said.         "Later on she was one of the first decorators to take Italian 18th-century furniture seriously," he said. "It was a reaction to all the gloomy Italian Renaissance pieces that had been so popular."         One person who remembers her style particularly well is the decorator Sister Parish. When Mrs. Parish married at age 19 and had been decorating for all of a year, Mrs. Parish's mother gave the newlyweds a small house on Gracie Square. "It had been decorated from top to bottom by Mrs. Brown," Mrs. Parish recalls. "I never forgave my mother."         Nonetheless, Mrs. Parish said, she still has antiques Mrs. Brown bought for her.         Mrs. Brown went to her office every day until she was 85. "She came in regularly for five years after that," said Betty Sherrill, president of McMillen.         For about 60 years she lived in a duplex apartment on East 57th Street that barely changed since she first decorated it. She once said, "If you get it right the first time there's no need for change." And indeed, Mrs. Brown lived by her beliefs. Every 20 years or so pieces of furniture were reupholstered and the walls given a fresh coat of paint, but always in the same shade of pale yellow.         Mrs. Brown is survived by a son, Louis A. McMillen of Concord, Mass., three grandsons and two great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M on Feb. 11 at St. James Episcopal Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         Colleen M. Sullivan, a former executive editor of Manhattan, inc. who also held editing positions at several newspapers, including The New York Times, was found dead Thursday in a motel room in West Hollywood, Calif. She was 40 years old.         Pending an autopsy, the cause of death has not been determined, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said.         Ms. Sullivan, an associate professor of journalism at the University of Florida, was also an author and a lawyer. From 1978 to 1981 she was an assistant editor in the financial news department of The Times. She was editor in chief of Medica, a national magazine for women practicing medicine, from 1982 to 1984, and was executive editor of Manhattan, inc. in 1985.         Before joining The Times, Ms. Sullivan had held editing positions at The Washington Post and Newsday. She went to the University of Florida as the Gannett Distinguished Visiting Professor of Journalism in 1986, and was named associate professor in 1987.         Ms. Sullivan was the author of "The Money Market Fund Primer," published by Macmillan in 1983. She also wrote books on financial scandals.         She was born in Seattle, graduated from New York University in 1971 and earned a law degree from Fordham University in 1976.         Ms. Sullivan, who lived in Gainesville, Fla., is survived by her mother, C. Burnice Sullivan of Seattle; her father, Charles E. Sullivan of San Jose, Calif.; a sister, Charla Sullivan of Seattle, and four brothers, Steven Sullivan of Canoga Park, Calif., Patrick and K. C. Sullivan, both of Seattle, and Mike Sullivan of San Jose.       
         Linda Marmelstein, an independent television producer, died Monday at the Cabrini Hospice. She was 55 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said a spokeswoman for Daniel Wilson Productions, where she had worked since 1969.         Among the productions she worked on were the mini-series "Hemingway"; the NBC television movie "The Great Wallendas"; a young people's series for CBS, "Henry Winkler Meets William Shakespeare," and "Secret of Charles Dickens."         Most recently, Ms. Marmelstein was working on a series of specials, "The Next Decade: The 90's, Our World in Transition."         Her longtime companion was Royal J. Wilds.         She is survived by her mother, Ann, of Washington and a brother, Charles, of Potomac, Md.       
         Dame Margot Fonteyn, whose blend of refinement and passion redefined 20th-century ballet style and made her an international idol as the prima ballerina of the Royal Ballet in Britain, died yesterday in Paitilla Hospital in Panama City. She was 71 years old and lived on a farm near La Quinta Pata, Panama.         Jane Hermann, the director of American Ballet Theater, said that she had been told of Dame Margot's death by telephone by Querube Brillenbourg, the ballerina's stepdaughter. Mrs. Brillenbourg said that Dame Margot had been ill for two and a half years but gave no further details. The Associated Press reported that Louis Martins, a friend of Dame Margot, said she did not want people to know she had cancer.         The impact of Dame Margot's career was so strong that successive generations of viewers identified her with distinct phases in their own dancegoing experience.         Most associated her with one of the greatest ballet partnerships in history when she and Rudolf Nureyev dazzled audiences in the 1960's and 1970's. Performing regularly, sometimes annually, in the United States for 15 years, the team was unsurpassed in critical acclaim, box office success and public adulation.         But Dame Margot was a superstar in her own right long before the term came into use. She sealed the reputation of the young British company that became the Royal Ballet when she conquered New York in 1949 as the radiant Princess Aurora in "The Sleeping Beauty." The English-born ballerina was associated with the growth of British ballet since 1934, and her effortless artistry was equated with a British style.         Dame Margot was also known as the muse of England's great choreographer, Sir Frederick Ashton, who created many of his major works for the young dancer whom he helped develop. Together they defined the lyrical side of 20th-century classicism in ballet. And yet as Dame Margot often demonstrated in her dancing, the ballerina with the openly well-bred style was also capable of a rush of passion -- an emotional outpouring that she made unforgettable in "Swan Lake," "Romeo and Juliet" and "Marguerite and Armand," which Sir Frederick choreographed as a vehicle for her and Mr. Nureyev in 1963.         Dame Margot was known for her musicality, beauty of line, inner radiance and refinement. Most of England's leading male dancers were her partners, and as noted by one, Michael Somes, their wish was to act as cavaliers -- to step back and to show her off. Sacheverell Sitwell, the British poet and essayist, said Dame Margot could be compared only "to a bird of beautiful plumage taking pleasure and exulting in its wings."         The New York Times dance critic John Martin analyzed her artistry in 1953 when he wrote: "She has a muscular awareness of the phrase which automatically translates music into movement, and her scale is beautifully sensitive, so that there is endless color in her movement. But beyond this, there is a feeling for choreographic form that gives shape and substance to the composition of what she is dancing, to a degree that one has never seen equaled in the ballet."  Studied Dance as a Child         Dame Margot was born Margaret Hookham in Reigate, Surrey, on May 18, 1919. Her father was an English engineer; her mother was half-Irish, half- Brazilian. As a child, she studied at dancing schools in the London area.         Her family moved around (she lived in Kentucky at one point), and when her father found work in China, she studied with George Goncharov, a Russian-born dancer who had settled in Shanghai. When she began to show talent, she and her mother returned to London, where she attended the school attached to the Vic-Wells Ballet (as the Royal Ballet was then known).         The teen-ager made her debut with the Vic-Wells as a snowflake in "The Nutcracker" in 1934. Borrowing her mother's maiden name, she initially danced as Margot Fontes, but soon modified her stage name to Fonteyn. Her brother, Felix, a photographer, also adopted Fonteyn as a professional name.         In 1935, Dame Margot received her first solo role, that of Young Tregennis, a doomed aristocrat, in "The Haunted Ballroom," a ballet by Ninette de Valois, the founder of the Royal Ballet. That same year, Sir Frederick created the role of the bride for her in "Le Baiser de la Fee." At the time, she told her mother: "Frederick Ashton is absolutely mad. His steps are impossible," but the dancer and the choreographer established an astonishing rapport. And Dame Margot later said, "There can be no doubt that my happiest moments on stage have been in Ashton ballets."         Sir Frederick often cast her as a frail or otherworldly being. In "Apparitions" (1936) she was an artist's unattainable vision, while in "Nocturne" (1936) she portrayed a poor flower seller wistfully watching rich people at a ball. But Sir Frederick also gave her a comic role in "A Wedding Bouquet" (1937), emphasized her charm in "Les Patineurs" (1937) and made her a classical soloist in such abstractions as "Symphonic Variations" (1946) and "Scenes de Ballet" (1948).         Other Ashton ballets in which she created starring roles included "Daphnis and Chloe" (1951), "Sylvia" (1952) and "La Peri" (1956). She charmed the public in Sir Frederick's "Ondine" (1958), which concerned a water spirit in love with a mortal, and she singled out the work as "my happiest ballet."  Widening Her Range         The ballerina herself noted that she had difficulty with styles foreign to her temperament. She was defeated by the speed necessary for the main role in George Balanchine's "Ballet Imperial." But she widened her range successfully and dramatically when she performed as a guest artist with Roland Petit's company in Paris in 1948.         Dame Margot appeared in productions by several contemporary choreographers, among them Sir Kenneth MacMillan's version of "Romeo and Juliet." In 1975, she danced in Martha Graham's "Lucifer" as a guest artist with the Graham company in Manhattan. She also excelled in classics like "Swan Lake," "Giselle" and Michel Fokine's "Firebird," which she imbued with a flashing brilliance.         Her most memorable classical portrayal was that of Princess Aurora in "The Sleeping Beauty." The Sadler's Wells Ballet (as the Vic-Wells was renamed before it became the Royal Ballet) made its United States debut in 1949 with the 1890 classic by Marius Petipa. The full four-act version was virtually unknown in this country. Dame Margot, then 30 years old, stunned the audience in the Metropolitan Opera House with her performance as the youthful Aurora.         "When she comes bounding in with all the young joyousness in the world at her first entrance in the birthday party scene," Mr. Martin, the Times critic, wrote, "the lights somehow seem to become brighter and the air fresher, and you know you are in the presence of magic."         Dame Margot's partners over the years included British ballet's major male dancers, among them Mr. Somes, Robert Helpmann and David Blair. Then in 1962, when she was 42 and was reportedly giving thought to retirement, she starred with Rudolf Nureyev, a 23-year-old defector from the Kirov Ballet of Leningrad, in the Royal Ballet's production of "Giselle," and an electrifying new partnership developed.  'She Represents Eternal Youth'         Dame Margot declared of Mr. Nureyev: "Something quite special happens when we dance together. It's odd because it's nothing we discussed or worked on, yet there in the photos both heads will be tilted to exactly the same angle, both in perfect geometric relationship to each other." And Mr. Nureyev said of Dame Margot, "For me, she represents eternal youth."         Sir Frederick created "Marguerite and Armand" (1963), an adaptation of Dumas's "Dame aux Camelias," for the stars, and they danced together with the Royal Ballet and as guests with other companies. Dame Margot continued to be a globe-trotting ballerina until the late 1970's, after which she made occasional guest appearances in mime roles; during the New York season of La Scala Ballet in 1981, she was Lady Capulet in "Romeo and Juliet."         Dame Margot married Dr. Roberto Arias, a Panamanian diplomat, in 1955. Nine years later, he was nearly paralyzed in an assassination attempt, and even as she maintained a strenuous performance schedule, Dame Margot devoted herself to his care until his death in November 1989.         She was named Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1950 and Dame of the Order of the British Empire in 1956. The Royal Ballet also officially named her its prima ballerina, although that title has rarely been used outside Russia in the 20th century.         Dame Margot, who occasionally coached younger dancers, helped members of the Houston Ballet in "Swan Lake" in 1989. On May 30, 1990, the Royal Ballet offered a gala performance of "Romeo and Juliet" in her honor at the Royal Opera House at which Sylvie Guillem and Jonathan Cope portrayed the young lovers and two of Dame Margot's former partners were seen in supporting roles. Mr. Nureyev was Mercutio and Mr. Somes came out of retirement to play Lord Capulet.         Dame Margot was the author of "Margot Fonteyn: An Autobiography" (1975) and "The Magic of Dance" (1979), based on a widely seen television series on dance history for which she was the commentator.         Summing up her career in her autobiography, she said: "My attitude has never changed. I cannot imagine feeling lackadaisical about a performance. I treat each encounter as a matter of life and death. The one important thing I have learned over the years is the difference between taking one's work seriously and taking one's self seriously. The first is imperative and the second disastrous."         In addition to Mrs. Brillenbourg, of New York City, and her brother, Felix, of London, she is survived by another stepdaughter, Rosita Arias, and a stepson, Roberto Arias, both of Panama.       
         Sylvia Wilson, a copy editor at The New York Times, died yesterday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 28 years old and lived in Hamden, Conn.         She died of brain cancer, her father, Steven, said.         Ms. Wilson was a graduate of Yale University and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. After working as an editorial assistant at Family Circle magazine, she joined The Times as a trainee in 1986, working on the copy desk of the Connecticut weekly section. In 1989, she moved to the copy desk of the Style section. Ill health forced her to stop working last year.         Besides her father, Ms. Wilson is survived by her mother, Doris, and two younger sisters, Toni and Kori, all of Hamden.       
         Sister Martha Christine Eber, a Lutheran deaconess, died on Tuesday at St. Clare's Hospital and Health Center in Manhattan. She was 91 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, said the Rev. Dale D. Hansen, pastor of St. Luke's Lutheran Church on West 46th Street.         Sister Eber, who was born in Pittsburgh, was consecrated in 1924. A registered nurse, she served until 1944 as a visiting nurse at Emmanuel Lutheran Church in Manhattan, working with immigrants. She left to take care of her mother, who had suffered a stroke.         Since 1957, Sister Eber was a deaconess at St. Luke's, helping the pastor, teaching Sunday school, visiting parish shut-ins and supervising the church office. She worked at the church until she went into the hospital two weeks ago.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Margaret Ann Chisholm, a bibliographer who worked for the Episcopal and Anglican churches, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. She was 59 years old and lived in Manhattan and London.         Miss Chisholm died after a cerebral hemorrhage, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She was executive assistant to Bishop Stephen F. Bayne in London in the late 1960's and early 1970's. She was the bibliographer of Bishop Bayne's work, and edited "Invitation to Prayer," the meditations of Eric Symes Abbot, retired dean of Westminster Abbey.         Miss Chisholm was born in Laurel, Miss., and was a graduate of Sweet Briar College in Sweet Briar, Va.         She is survived by her mother, Elisabeth Gardiner Wisher Chisholm of Laurel, Miss., and two sisters, Jean C. Lindsey of Laurel and Manhattan, and Cynthia Saint Amand of Manhattan.       
         Olga Kattan, a professor of Spanish language and literature at Brooklyn College for the last 25 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62 years old.         She died of cancer, her niece, Roxanna Siman, said.         Dr. Kattan, a 1963 Ph.D. graduate of the University of Madrid, taught at the University of Pennsylvania and at Wells College before joining Brooklyn College in 1966. For many years, she directed the City University of New York's program abroad at the University of Seville and often took groups of students from the New York metropolitan area to Spain.         In 1988 the Government of Spain honored her with an award for fostering intercultural understanding. Dr. Kattan did extensive research on the Arabic influence in Spanish literature and recently completed a translation of a medieval Hispanic-Arabic manuscript.         She is survived by her mother, Mania, of Manhattan; two sisters, Jeanette Siman of Guatemala City and Betty Nasser of New Windsor, N.Y., and two brothers, Antonio, of Caracas, Venezuela, and Rene, of San Pedro Sula, Honduras.       
         When Carol Perkins sat down in the New York Times cafeteria last week, she pulled down her lower lip and exposed two big white blisters. "They're not herpes," she announced, which certainly turned a lot of heads. But that is something she expects.         Ms. Perkins is a model with the Eileen Ford Agency, and her face -- not to mention the rest of her -- is familiar to anyone who shops through the Victoria's Secret catalogue or reads Vogue. Recently, she has been moonlighting at "Penn and Teller: The Refrigerator Tour," playing at the Eugene O'Neill Theater, which is where the blisters come in. Ms. Perkins works with Penn and Teller, the comic magic team, who bill themselves as "a couple of eccentric guys who've learned to do a few cool things," as a fire-eater.         And if the show's opening act is for the children -- a giant refrigerator is dropped directly on top of the two stars -- then the bit called "Burnin' Luv" is the adults' payoff. Ms. Perkins and Penn Jillette perform a hilarious parody of sex by eating fire, after which Ms. Perkins, wearing an impossibly low-cut dress, strikes a match and lights a cigarette directly from Mr. Jillette's mouth.  An Unmodel-like Model         That someone whose face is her livelihood should take such risks is the height of perversity. But looks aside, Ms. Perkins seems nothing like most models. During the entire lunch she never once mentioned the size of her pores, or how many glasses of water she drank before noon, and she told her age, 33, without hesitation. "Why not?" she asked. "I look pretty good for 33."         She said she loved cafeteria food, and had never had a weight problem. And though she skipped the steam table meat, she eagerly ate up a plate of mashed turnips and peas, which she covered in butter, and followed it with a roll, coffee and a cigarette.         She does dress like a model, perfectly pulled together in a dark turquoise Harris tweed jacket, cashmere sweater, Hermes scarf, corduroy pants and a string of pearls. Then she admitted that she bought the jacket in a thrift shop, on what she called a "junkin' " spree.         Since she learned to eat fire last fall, Ms. Perkins said, she has been "burnt really bad." She pointed to her chin, which looked fine. But she insistently rubbed off her makeup, until the maroon shadow of a burn finally appeared.  A Well-Timed Ignition         Isn't this just about the most awful thing that could happen to her         face?         Her fortune? Apparently not. "I'm not real fussy about things like breaking a nail or getting a wrinkle." Yes, but isn't this is a little more serious? "I couldn't work when I got burned," she said, "but I had taken those two weeks off anyway for rehearsal. It took a couple of weeks for the big old scab to fall off."         Mr. Jillette, who is the tall one, with the ponytail, is Ms. Perkins's partner in "Burnin' Luv." He said in a phone interview: "Her chances of being disfigured and landing in the hospital are slim. Eating fire is safer than walking on the street. She got a nickel-sized blister on her chin, that's all."         Isn't she giving Eileen Ford an ulcer? "Not at all," Ms. Perkins said. "She told me she's never had a model go to Broadway before."'         Also, Ms. Perkins said, there is no insurance policy for her face. She said she didn't need one. "When you're learning to eat fire you're fearful and respectful," she said. "But I got confident and kind of cocky about it, and I just wasn't paying attention. I'm back on guard again."         How did she ever get mixed up in all of this? A longtime fan of Penn and Teller, she arranged an introduction through a friend about a year ago. Last fall, when the duo was rehearsing for an NBC television special, Mr. Jillette called her and asked if she could help find a replacement for Isabella Rossellini, for whom he had written the bit, who had just been cast in a movie. They needed someone famous, Ms. Perkins said, to satisfy the network.         "I suggested Lauren Hutton, who's pretty gutsy, Joan Severance and Carrie Fisher," she said. "I called some girls for him but none came through. Then about a week before the special taped they got into a jam. Penn called me and said: 'We're really on our knees. Can you learn to eat fire so you can show whoever it is we get? You can be the understudy.' And I thought, what a cool thing. I live around the corner from the rehearsal place, so I threw on my jeans and left. I was terrified."         But she turned out to be a quick study, and when no one better known was willing to risk her face, she got the job. "She was our absolute last choice," said Mr. Jillette. "She really likes fire eating, which I don't. When she was learning we would scream at her not to really get comfortable, just to look comfortable."         As the act progressed, the two got comfortable with each other as well, and soon found themselves in the gossip columns. What is it like to kiss after eating fire? "What happens is you burp up gasoline," Ms. Perkins said, laughing. "It's pretty gross." How New York Is Unlike Sarasota         But still exciting for a woman who grew up Sarasota, Fla., where the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus spent its winters and was home to the Ringling Brothers Museum and Clown College. As a child, Ms. Perkins said, she performed in the children's Sailor Circus, along with Emmett Kelly's daughter and a daughter of one of the Flying Wallendas. She specialized in tumbling and riding the unicycle.         Since she didn't have to run away to join the circus, she graduated from high school a year early and ran away from it, to New York at the age of 16: "It seemed so alive compared to the resort-town feel in Sarasota, which catered to vacation living. I loved the chaos in New York, the subways and the dirt. I hung out with a musician boyfriend and modeled for a minute at Wilhelmina. But I wasn't mentally prepared for it, until a few years later."         Ms. Perkins says she has a one-year commitment to the Penn and Teller show, which has been extended on Broadway indefinitely. Then, she said, she plans to split her time between New York and Sarasota, where she wants to establish a women's resource center similar to Hope for Housing in New York, which teaches skills to women on welfare, in rehabilitation programs and recently released from prison. She said her family still lives in Sarasota, where her father is a school principal, and her mother is a painter.         But for now, she is still a model and a fire-eater. At a recent weekend performance full of children, a number of them lined up outside after the show to get the stars' autographs. When Ms. Perkins was spotted near the stage door, a small group of prepubescent boys shyly lined up in front of her, programs in hand. Though she had changed out of her costume, the dress she was wearing was equally low cut. And judging from the looks of rapture on those faces as she bent over to sign the Playbills, the fascination with the falling refrigerator was a thing of the past.         She's getting a kick out of it, too. "It's a once in a lifetime opportunity," she said. "If I had tried to plot it out this way it couldn't have happened. And it really is the perfect part-time job. Because I eat fire a lot better than I type."       
         Devorah Heller, the director of employee relations for the Yonkers public school system, died on Monday at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 52 years old and lived in Yonkers.         She died of breast cancer, said her son, Lawrence.         Mrs. Heller joined the Yonkers school system in 1974 as a social studies teacher, worked with disadvantaged youngsters and in 1981 was named coordinator of information services. In 1986, when the Yonkers schools were desegregated under a court order, she was prominent as spokeswoman for the district at a time of great tension. She became director of employee relations in 1987 and handled contract negotiations with school employees. She was a graduate of Bronx High School of Science, Hunter College and Fordham University.         She is survived by her husband, Michael; her mother, Beatrice Gittleman; two sons, Lawrence, of Manhattan, and Mark, of Plainview, L.I., and two sisters, Shula Brudner of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Toby Edelson of Suffern, N.Y.       
         Patricia Golden Levine, an artist known professionally as Pat Golden, died on Friday at her home in Chevy Chase, Md. She was 48 years old and also had an estate in Rappahannock County, Va.         She died of lymphoma, her family said.         Ms. Golden did oil paintings, woodcuts, stained-glass works and, in recent years, large drawings in colored pencil. Her artwork was exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the Vorpal Gallery in San Francisco and elsewhere around the country.         She was a skilled equestrian and did many drawings of horses, often in verdant Virginia landscapes. She was sometimes described as a representational artist of the West Coast figurative school.         A native of Washington, she earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in art at the University of California at Berkeley. As a graduate student, she studied with Elmer Bischoff and David Hockney.         She is survived by her husband, Barry Levine, a partner in the Washington law firm of Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin; a son, Adam Golden Levine, a student at the University of California at Santa Barbara; two daughters, Kiera S. Levine and Surell Golden Levine; her father, Dr. Benjamin E. Golden, a general surgeon, and her mother, Dita Seiden Golden, of Washington, and two sisters, Soma Golden Behr, the national editor of The New York Times, of Manhattan, and Carol Golden Sadeh, a historian and tour guide, of Ein Karem, Israel.       
         Kathryn Teaze, a Red Cross volunteer whose more than 70 years of service spanned two world wars, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Fairfield, Conn. She was 93 years old and lived in Weston, Conn.         She died of pneumonia, a family spokesman said.         Her mother started the Red Cross chapter in her hometown of Bloomfield, N.J. Mrs. Teaze's late husband, Moses, was president of the chapter and of the Westport-Weston chapter after the couple moved to Connecticut in 1950.         She joined the Red Cross at the age of 18, shortly after the start of World War I, and became captain of the motor corps for the chapter in Bloomfield. During the 1920's and 1930's, she continued to transport soldiers to and from hospitals. When World War II began, she became co-captain of the Red Cross Motor Corps. In the 1950's she began helping drives for the newly established Red Cross blood bank. She ceased her volunteer activities in mid-1990.         She is survived by two sons, Allison D., of Little Falls, N.J., and David A., of New Canaan, Conn.; a daughter, Kathryn Clark of Weston; 9 grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and a great-great-grandchild.       
         Dr. Frances Fuchs Schachter, a child psychologist, died on Thursday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 61 years old.         She died of lung cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         Dr. Schachter's primary interest was in developmental psychology, in work with brothers and sisters, language development in young children and parent-toddler relations.         Since 1983, Dr. Schachter had been supervising pediatric psychologist at Metropolitan Hospital and an associate professor of clinical pediatrics at New York Medical College. She also had a private practice in family therapy.         From 1974 to 1982 she was an assistant professor of psychology at Barnard College, and in the early 1970's she was a pychologist at the Bank Street College of Education. In the 1960's, she was a member of the department of child psychiatry at St. Luke's Hospital.         She was the author of "Everyday Mother Talk to Toddlers: Early Intervention" (Academic Press, 1979), and co-editor with Richard K. Stone of "Practical Concerns About Siblings: Bridging the Research-Practice Gap" (Haworth Press, 1987).         Dr. Schachter was born in the Bronx, graduated from Barnard College and received a Ph.D. in clinical psychology from the University of Rochester. She began her career in 1955 as an instructor at Stanford University.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. David Schachter, professor of physiology and cellular biophysics at Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons; a son, Jonathan, a post-doctoral researcher at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics in Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Leah Ann , an intern at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston; her mother, Sadie Fuchs of the Bronx; a sister, Norma Resnick of Woodmere, L.I., and two brothers, Daniel Fuchs of Tenafly, N.J., and Leonard Fuchs of Armonk, N.Y.       
         Friedelind Wagner, a granddaughter of the composer Richard Wagner who won fame for her courageous opposition to Nazism, died early yesterday evening at the Community Hospital in Herdecke, Germany, in the Ruhr. She was 73 years old.         She died of liver disease, said her nephew, Gottfried Wagner.         Miss Wagner, who bore an uncanny resemblance to her grandfather, was born in Bayreuth, Germany, the site of the annual summer Wagner festival. She was educated in Germany and England and at the Sorbonne in Paris.         Her father, Siegfried, whom she adored, died in 1930, along with her grandmother Cosima, who was Franz Liszt's daughter. It was her English-born mother, Winifred, whose fanatic admiration for Adolf Hitler (and Hitler's equally fanatic admiration for Wagner's music) made Bayreuth into a Nazi shrine in the 1930's. Fled the Nazis         Friedelind Wagner, always a rebel, resisted that trend and finally fled Germany in 1940 amid a burst of publicity.         "I was always stubborn and independent," she said in an interview in 1944. "I only had to listen to Hitler rave and rant to be disgusted and horrified."         When war broke out in September 1940, she was visiting in Switzerland. Already an outspoken opponent of Nazism, she realized that the protection she had enjoyed as a member of the Wagner family would no longer guarantee her safety. Although offered asylum in Britain, she was interned by bureaucratic accident for three months. Toscanini's Intercession         Released at the intercession of the conductor Arturo Toscanini, another outspoken anti-Fascist, she came to the United States in 1942 after detours to Uruguay and Argentina. During the war she remained an active anti-Nazi propagandist, a particular embarassment for the Nazis, given their idolatry of Wagner.         Miss Wagner's career after 1945 was a checkered one. She wrote a lively autobiography, "Heritage of Fire," but her only real ally in the Wagner family was her brother Wieland. His brilliant career as a stage director and designer and co-director of the Bayreuth Festival was cut short by his death in 1966.         Until then Miss Wagner had directed the Bayreuth Festival Master Classes, a summerlong series of workshops and instruction for young singers, conductors, directors and critics. After Wieland's death, the hostility shown her by her mother and her brother Wolfgang turned her later years into a gypsylike odyssey as she fruitlessly attempted to find support for her dream of a theatrical academy.         She lived in northern England for a number of years, then attempted to relocate to Bayreuth and spent her final years in Lucerne.         She is survived by her brother Wolfgang, of Bayreuth, and a sister, Verena Lafferentz, of Uberlingen, Germany.       
         Dame Peggy Ashcroft, an actress who was in the forefront of British theater for more than half a century, died yesterday in London. She was 83 years old.         She suffered a stroke on May 23 and was unconscious in the Royal Free Hospital since then, a spokeswoman for the hospital said.         Dame Peggy was in the Old Vic company in the early 1930's, frequently appearing with John Gielgud in the 1930's and 40's. She often performed in the West End of London in the 1950's and with the Royal Court, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1956 and in 1962 she became the first British actress to have a theater -- the Ashcroft, in her hometown, Croydon -- named after her in her lifetime.         When she was in her mid-70's Dame Peggy won her greatest international acclaim from roles involving two visits to India. She played a saintly, enigmatic Englishwoman in David Lean's film of E. M. Forster's novel "A Passage to India" and then was cast as a doubting former missionary in a television mini-series, "The Jewel in the Crown," based on Paul Scott's "Raj Quartet."         She won a 1984 Academy Award as best supporting actress for the film; the New York Film Critics Circle voted her best actress. The two performances brought her Britain's top film and television awards. She had previously won a string of awards as the finest actress on the British stage, and in April she won a special Laurence Olivier Award, London's major theatrical prize, for lifetime achievement in the theater. A Juliet to Remember         Dame Peggy was praised as a natural actress who projected an inner serenity and moral gravity. She illumined all of Shakespeare's young leading women and was hailed as the finest Juliet of her generation, artfully attuning her performances to Gielgud and Olivier versions of Romeo and Mercutio as the actors alternated in the roles throughout a season.         Detractors called some of her early performances too genteel and cool, too English bourgeois, but over the decades she displayed increasing versatility in plays by Shaw, Sheridan, Chekhov, Wilde and Ibsen. With uncommon ease she worked closely with new generations of theater people and in later years played Shakespearean matrons and roles created by Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, Harold Pinter and Beckett.         Her talents included portraying the rejected, the lonely and the oppressed with unsentimental sympathy. As Winnie in Beckett's "Happy Days," she was required to spend the first half of the performance buried up to her waist, the second half to her neck. It's "the greatest part ever written," she said, "nearer to Everywoman than any other I can think of, and like climbing Everest to perform."         In approaching hundreds of roles, including 10 leads in a season at the Old Vic, she tirelessly sought psychological truths. "Acting," she said in 1985, "is a mysterious business, so complicated, so tender a subject, there are no rules, and I think one works instinctively."  'Shimmering Radiance'         Defining her art in "Peggy Ashcroft," a 1988 biography, the critic Michael Billington cited her ear for language, her emotional identification with characters and avoidance of vulgarity and affectation.         Sir John Gielgud spoke of the actress's "shimmering radiance and a kind of forthright, trusting quality." The director Peter Hall said she maintained in old age an "extraordinary immediacy and passionate naivete." Harold Pinter said, "This flame of life she possesses informs all she does."         Dame Peggy appeared in only a few movies. Her most memorable early one was a vignette in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 thriller, "The 39 Steps," as a farmer's wife who bravely aids the hero (Robert Donat).         In making films she missed the theater's long, searching rehearsals. The problem with films, she said, "is that you have to imagine everything in sufficient detail before you begin."         "With the theater," she added, "there is time to try things out. With filming, it is hit or miss."         She said appearing in films was "instant acting" because a film actor might have to begin at the end of a scene or a movie and not be able to build a role. "Also, you're in the hands of a director and an editor who can cut and shape, and you have no idea how," she said. "And, of course, there's no sharing with an audience, no rapport."         Dame Peggy said she had no desire to retire. "Just a rest after the rather full years I had in India," she said in 1985. "Then I'll wait and see what television or film or the theater bring."         She cherished privacy and granted few interviews, once explaining gently, "I'm not interested in myself, very." But she was outspoken in protesting injustices and inhumaneness, at home or abroad. She criticized apartheid in South Africa and protested the sentencing of a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky, and political arrests in Czechoslovakia.         Edith Margaret Emily Ashcroft was born on Dec. 22, 1907, in Croydon, a London suburb, to William Worsley Ashcroft, an estate appraiser, and the former Violetta Maud Bernheim. Her father was killed in World War I when she was 10 and her mother died when she was 18, leaving her elder brother, Edward, as her only close relative.         She studied at the Woodford School in Croydon and after discovering "it was very exciting to become someone else," she said, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Her varied roles included Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello in 1930, stardom as Juliet and Shakespeare's other golden girls, as she called them, and title roles in Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," John Drinkwater's "Mary Stuart" and Arthur Schnitzler's "Fraulein Elsa."         A 1989 biography of Paul Robeson by Martin Bauml Duberman revealed that Dame Peggy and the actor had had an affair during the run of "Othello," and quoted her as saying, "How could one not fall in love in such a situation with such a man?"         Later roles included an alcoholic mother in "Edward, My Son," in both London and New York; an unloved spinster in "The Heiress," leading parts in Brecht's "Good Woman of Setzuan," Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and "Rosmersholm" and the 10-hour tour de force as Margaret of Anjou in the Royal Shakespeare Company's "Wars of the Roses."         Dame Peggy was married and divorced three times. She is survived by two children, Nicholas, a director, and Eliza, by her third husband, Jeremy Hutchinson, a lawyer. Her previous husbands were Rupert Hart-Davis, a publisher, and Theodore Komisarjevsky, a director.       
         Jean Arthur, the buoyant actress whose piquant charm and infectious laughter enriched some of the finest comedy dramas of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at the Carmel Convalescent Hospital in Carmel, Calif., where she lived for 35 years. She was 90 years old.         Miss Arthur died of a heart ailment, a family spokeswoman said.         Miss Arthur had a bubbly flair for reflecting the absurdities of life, a subtle vulnerability and a voice that wavered unpredictably between the spunky and the amiable.         The classic films she graced included three by Frank Capra -- "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" -- and also George Stevens's "More the Merrier" and Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair."  A Marshmallow Heart         Miss Arthur's winsome talent was brightest in roles where her hard-boiled career woman's exterior masked a marshmallow heart, as when she first exploited and then inspired such country bumpkins as Gary Cooper as Mr. Deeds and James Stewart as Mr. Smith in their uphill challenges to greed and corruption.         The actress's honesty made even implausible scenes and films appear credible. A shy perfectionist, she was invariably self-critical of her performances, refused to pose for cheesecake photographs, rarely granted interviews and was often suspended by Columbia Pictures for rejecting roles. "I just couldn't act in a bad picture," she once said.         She began acting on the Broadway stage and returned in 1950 for a widely praised performance in the title role of "Peter Pan," Sir James M. Barrie's 1904 fantasy about the lad who refused to grow up. The production had 321 performances, one of the longest runs for the classic. Interpreting 'Peter Pan'         The hit prompted Miss Arthur to drop her guard and give an interviewer this interpretation of the theme: "Peter represents the youth in all of us: the freshness and originality of childhood before our parents and schoolteachers have pressed us into a mold. Barrie meant that we should not let that 'genius of childhood' escape us, not let our neighbors and the man at the corner grocery store do our thinking for us. If I can get over the message that we should all try to be ourselves, to be free individuals, then I'm sure I'll have accomplished what Barrie wanted."         The actress, who was originally named Gladys Georgianna Greene, was born on Oct. 17, 1900, in Plattsburg, N.Y., and grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. Her father was a photographer. When pressed by Hollywood to choose a stage name, she selected one honoring two idols: Jeanne d'Arc and King Arthur.         She attended George Washington High School and soon became a successful advertising model, which led to a movie test and contract. She acted in dozens of silent two-reel comedies, melodramas and westerns. Easily making the transition to sound, she played ingenues in a spate of comedies, adventure yarns and melodramas. In three of them, she had to cope wih the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (played by Warner Oland).  Back to Hollywood         But unhappy with her roles and determined to master her art, Miss Arthur returned to New York in the early 1930's and acted for several years on the summer theater circuit and Broadway in a total of 14 plays. Most were flops, but critics began to laud her maturing talent.         She won a contract with Columbia Pictures, returned to Hollywood and her comic talents blossomed in "The Whole Town's Talking," a 1935 gangster yarn of mistaken identity.         Miss Arthur credited Frank Capra with nurturing her skill in "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (1936) and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939). In the first comedy, playing a reporter, she humiliates a naive well-meaning heir -- played by Mr. Cooper -- and then saves him from his greedy tormentors at a sanity hearing. In "Mr. Smith," as a secretary, she deceives an artless young senator (Mr. Stewart), but later uses her parliamentary expertise to aid his filibuster and defeat his foes.         Other comedy successes included "Easy Living," "You Can't Take It With You," "The Devil and Miss Jones," "The Talk of the Town," "The More the Merrier," in which she, with Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn, wrestled with the housing shortage in World War II Washington, and "A Foreign Affair." She was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in "More the Merrier."         The actress also won plaudits for roles in such films as "Diamond Jim," "The Plainsman," "History Is Made at Night," "Only Angels Have Wings," "Arizona" and later, in 1953, in "Shane," about the disturbing effect of a gunfighter (Alan Ladd) on a frontier family, with Miss Arthur playing a gentle and loyal wife and mother.         At the peak of her career, in the mid- 1940's, she began studying many liberal-arts subjects at colleges. "All my life," she said, "I've wanted to make enough money so I could stop and be a student for a while. The only real reason for living is doing what you want to do, or trying to, anyway." Years later, she taught acting at Vassar College.         Her later stage appearances were frustrated by directorial and cast disputes and illnesses. On television, she played an urbane lawyer in "The Jean Arthur Show" in 1966, but the scripts were more far-fetched than funny.         Her elusiveness led to contrasting stories about her self-doubts and later psychoanalysis with Dr. Erich Fromm. In 1972, she remarked, "I guess I became an actress because I didn't want to be myself."         Miss Arthur was married twice, to Julian Anker, a photographer, in 1928, and to Frank Ross, a producer, from 1932 to 1949. Both marriages ended in divorce.         In later decades, she spent most of her time at her coastal retreat in Carmel, where she once remarked, "I have a very good life" with some good friends, a brood of cats and "the sea on three sides of me."         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Vera Yarrow, a teacher in the New York City public school system and a diction coach to singrs and actors, died yesterday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Yarrow, the mother of the singer Peter Yarrow of the group Peter, Paul and Mary, died of leukemia, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She taught English, speech and drama at various public schools, among them the Julia Richman High School in Manhattan, Walton High School in the Bronx, and Girls' Commercial High School in Brooklyn. She also lectured at Hunter College and coached singers and actors privately.         Mrs. Yarrow was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1903 and came to the United States three years later. She was a graduate of Hunter College and did postgraduate work at Columbia University.         In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Elena Mezzetti of Perugia, Italy; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Candy Jernigan, a painter, sculptor and set designer, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She was 39 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of liver cancer, said a friend, Jed Wheeler.         Ms. Jernigan was known for witty, vivid collagist work that was as much social commentary as art. It incorporated maps, landscapes, rocks and found objects, and it often took the form of one-of-a-kind printed books that included short autobiographical writings. Her work has been exhibited at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Albright-Knox Museum in Buffalo, the Bronx Museum and the Boston Children's Museum, as well as several galleries in New York City. Her theater work included sets for John Moran's multi-media opera "The Manson Family" and collaborations with XXY Dance/Music, a multi-media dance company.         Ms. Jernigan is survived by her husband, the composer Philip Glass, a stepdaughter, Juliet, and a stepson, Zachary, all of Manhattan; her mother, Pauline Bauer of Jupiter, Fla., and a sister, Audrey Hart of Key West, Fla.         A memorial service will be held at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, Amsterdam Avenue and 112th Street, on Friday at 1 P.M.       
         Eva Le Gallienne, who as an actress, producer, director, translator, writer and teacher was for many decades one of the grand figures of the American stage, died late Monday night at her home in Weston, Conn. She was 92 years old.         The cause of death was heart failure, said a friend, Anne Kaufman Schneider.         A commanding presence on the stage and a strong-minded director, Miss Le Gallienne was actually a slight and, according to her friends, a shy and private person, her affections being concentrated on her dogs and other pets. In a memoir, she expressed surprise at being called beautiful by critics; she said she thought beauty might be a burden.         She was dedicated to the theater from early childhood, two aunts and an uncle having been successful English actors. She was born in London on Jan. 11, 1899, the daughter of Richard Le Gallienne, a then-famous poet and journalist, and the former Julie Norregard, a Danish journalist. Her parents were divorced when Eva was 4 years old, and she and her mother moved to Paris. Saw Bernhardt Act         There, as a young girl, she saw Sarah Bernhardt act, and was taken backstage to meet the star. The experience was to determine the course of Miss Le Gallienne's own life.         "It made such an enormous impression on me that I thought, 'That's what I'd like to do,' " she said.         Eva was 15 when Constance Collier, a family friend, got her a walk-on role in Maeterlinck's "Monna Vanna" in London. She attended a drama school for a few months, but left for a part as a cockney servant girl in a minor comedy -- and brought down the house.         On the strength of rave reviews and encouragement from theater folk, Miss Le Gallienne and her mother left wartime London in 1915 for New York. Her bright expectations were not immediately realized. The first two plays in which she found work were failures, and she was dismissed from the cast of another play during its out-of-town tryouts. She spent a season on the road and in summer stock.  First Success         Finally, at the age of 20, she enjoyed her first big success, opposite Sidney Blackmer in Arthur Richman's "Not So Long Ago." This was followed by a still greater hit in 1921 with Joseph Schildkraut in the Theater Guild's production of Molnar's "Liliom."         In 1923, she had another hit in the star role in "The Swan" by Molnar. During its long run in 1923 and again in 1924-25, she became obsessed with the need for a repertory theater.         "Miss Le G.," as generations of theater people called her, came closer than any other person to endowing the United States with a permanent company performing repertory in the manner of the Old Vic, the Comedie Francaise and the Moscow Art Theater.         Without any government subsidy, she very nearly realized her dream. Willingly abandoning a career as a Broadway star in 1926, she founded the Civic Repertory Theater and staged classics at popular prices that filled the old 14th Street Theater for six seasons.         The Civic Rep's production of "Peter Pan," with the actress sailing to the balcony on an invisible wire, enchanted masses of children, and Josephine Hutchinson as "Alice in Wonderland" with Miss Le Gallienne as the White Queen enchanted grownups as well.         Among the company's apprentices were such hopeful novices as Burgess Meredith, John Garfield, J. Edward Bromberg and Howard Da Silva.         But although the Civic Repertory played in the main to full houses, the box office, with a top ticket price of $1.50, never quite met its budget. The company's wealthy patrons were hit by the Depression, donations dwindled and the theater closed in 1933. By then it had given 1,581 performances of 34 plays -- 32 of which Miss Le Gallienne had directed. She also acted in a majority of the plays.         At the end of the 1930-31 season, Miss Le Gallienne was severely burned in the explosion of a gasoline stove at her country home in Weston. The use of her hands was only partly restored in a series of operations, but she so mastered the handicap that few in her audiences perceived it.         After a series of operations on her crippled hands, she directed and starred on Broadway in Rostand's "L'Aiglon" with Ethel Barrymore.  'Rather Play Ibsen Than Eat'         After its long run, Miss Le Gallienne performed the balcony scene from "Romeo and Juliet" in vaudeville, and translated, staged and acted in Ibsen's "Rosmersholm." It failed, using up her financial reserves. Long afterward, she wrote, "I would rather play Ibsen than eat -- and that's often just what it amounts to."         With her longtime companion, the late actress Marion Evensen, she moved to the estate at Weston, which she had bought at a prosperous time in 1926. There, with barnyard and forest creatures, cats and a kennel of cairn terriers, she busily gardened, wove, wrote and studied for the rest of her life -- but never abandoned the theater.         She lectured at colleges, toured frequently in plays and realized a youthful ambition by playing "Hamlet," in a summer production that she staged with the young Uta Hagen as Ophelia. For the Theater Guild, she directed a series of revivals at popular prices.         During the war years, the actress also toured for the Guild as Mrs. Malaprop in "The Rivals" and returned to Broadway as a star opposite Joseph Schildkraut in two successes: "Uncle Harry" by Thomas Job and a new "Cherry Orchard." She had also produced the play and helped to translate it.         With Margaret Webster and Cheryl Crawford, Miss Le Gallienne helped organize the American Repertory Theater in 1946, but the reviews were mixed, the costs were high and the three leaders did not always agree. The first season was the last.         In 1958, her television production of "The Bridge of San Luis Rey" was described by Jack Gould, the New York Times critic, as "unforgettable" and her part as "acting at its supreme best." Played Queen Elizabeth         Another memorable role was her performance as Queen Elizabeth in Schiller's "Mary Stuart," which she did on stage across the country periodically from 1957 through 1962, and also on television.         As translator, director and a star of Chekhov's "Seagull" in 1964, Miss Le Gallienne received from Adlai E. Stevenson the award of the American National Theater and Academy. She got another ANTA award on her 78th birthday in 1977.         She was then on tour, in "The Royal Family." The revival of the Edna Ferber-George S. Kaufman comedy based on the Barrymore family was a hit of the 1976 Broadway season and a triumph for Miss Le Gallienne, who played the mother of the tribe, skipping girlishly upstairs in Act I and descending like an elderly queen in Act III.         As a result of her work in "The Royal Family," she received New York City's cultural award, the Handel Medallion, and the observation by the actress Rosemary Harris:         "If you listen to Miss Le G., you can hear 15 shades of meaning in 15 syllables."         In 1981 Miss Le Gallienne returned to Broadway in "To Grandmother's House We Go," which ran for only 61 performances. Returned as White Queen         But her enthusiasm for her next Broadway project was boundless, since it involved her co-directing a late 1982 revival of her beloved "Alice in Wonderland" and again assuming the role of the White Queen. It, too, however, was a flop, closing after 21 regular performances.         In 1986, President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Medal of Arts.         Miss Le Gallienne traveled everywhere for many years with a two-pound Yorkshire terrier, Nana, in a little basket.         After observing two barnyard hens, she wrote a children's book, "Flossie and Bossie: A Moral Tale." She also translated "Seven Tales by Hans Christian Andersen" and wrote a bio graphy, "The Mystic in the Theater: Eleonora Duse" (1966).         Stagestruck to the end, she once recalled a young woman complaining that she had never seen Sarah Bernhardt, Sacha Guitry, Isadora Duncan or Duse. "I thought to myself," Miss Le Gallienne said, " 'I wouldn't change places with you for anything; not even to be 20 again!' "         There are no survivors.       
         Jiang Qing, the widow of Mao and herself a leader of China during some of its most tumultuous years, has committed suicide, the Government announced tonight. She was 77 years old.         Ms. Jiang was serving a life prison sentence for her role as leader of the Gang of Four. That name was given to the group of radical Communist leaders whose closeness to the all-powerful Mao enabled them to speak in his name and carry out what they said were his policies during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.         Ms. Jiang killed herself in the early hours of May 14, the official New China News Agency reported. The three-paragraph dispatch did not say how she had committed suicide or why, and it was impossible to confirm the account. The agency said also Ms. Jiang had been receiving medical treatment outside prison since May 1984. Grew Up in Poverty         Raised in conditions so poor that hunger reportedly left her with lifelong stomach problems, Ms. Jiang grew up to become a beautiful actress, then used her marriage to Mao to reach the apex of power in China and help preside over the brutal persecution and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She tried to build her own power base and exercised real control over much of Chinese culture, but in the end she owed her authority, and her ability to inspire fear, to her link with Mao. When he died in 1976, she and her allies in the Gang of Four were soon overthrown.         Few people have been so hated in modern Chinese history, and after her fall she became a symbol of the excesses and brutality of the Cultural Revolution. When her trial was televised each night at the end of 1980, most of the nation was delighted and riveted by the spectacle of Ms. Jiang in the dock. She refused to repent, and even taunted the court to chop off her head.         It was grand drama, for Ms. Jiang could be cruel, petty, ruthless and couragious. Above all, her ambition was dizzying.         "Sex is engaging in the first rounds," she once told an interviewer. "What sustains interest in the long run is political power."         The delay in announcing her death almost certainly was linked to the Government's concern about possible protests leading up to the second anniversary today of the army crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. While it would be difficult to imagine university students taking to the streets to mourn her, the authorities apparently thought it best not to take any risks. Tiananmen Date Passes Quietly         In fact, the Tiananmen anniversary passed quietly today, and Ms. Jiang's death seems unlikely to have any major impact on the Chinese political scene. While there is some nostalgia for Mao, his widow was linked with just the kind of ideological extremism from which many Chinese are now trying to escape.         Ms. Jiang (her name is pronounced jyahng ching) came to symbolize the fanatical egalitarianism and passion for ideology of the Cultural Revolution years. Paradoxically, China has returned half a step in that direction in the last two years, and the present leadership is almost certainly far closer to her ideologically than to the growing number of young intellectuals who are waiting for a post-Communist period to dawn.         To many young Chinese, there is not much difference between Ms. Jiang and some of the neo-Maoist hard-liners who remain in power. Ms. Jiang was faulted for persecuting intellectuals, for insisting on an inane uniformity in the arts and for joining in the violent suppression of a democracy movement at Tiananmen Square -- an earlier one, in 1976. Those are precisely the complaints that young people have about some of today's leaders.         During the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Jiang oversaw mass rallies in which her enemies were humiliated and physically abused. She also is said to have sought out and killed those who spurned her in earlier years.         One of her grave miscalculations, in retrospect, was to make an enemy of Deng Xiaoping, now China's senior leader, and denounce him as an "international capitalist agent."         Ms. Jiang has been widely criticized for her ambition and for her efforts to exploit her relationship with Mao for personal gain. There is no doubt that the former actress offended other leaders, usually men, with her aggressiveness, and many accused her of using beauty and sex to win power.         Ms. Jiang caught Mao's eye in the caves at Yanan, the Red Army's hideaway in northern China during the civil war against the Nationalists, in 1938, and she scandalized top Communist officials when the couple apparently began living together before Mao got around to divorcing his previous wife, a respected revolutionary. Ms. Jiang was Mao's third wife, not counting a childhood betrothal that was never consummated.         Apparently because of indignation at the divorce of the second wife and a sense of impropriety that Ms. Jiang was just 24 years old while Mao was 45, party officials reportedly insisted that Mao could marry Ms. Jiang only if she never exercised any political power.         Mao kept that bargain for decades, even after the Communist victory of 1949 established him as the leader of the People's Republic of China. In the 1950's, Ms. Jiang held only minor posts in the cultural world, and there are some indications that the marriage was not going well. Ms. Jiang was in Moscow for health treatment, for example, when Mao made a state visit to the Soviet Union. But he did not visit her. Role in Cultural Revolution         In the 1960's, as Mao felt his influence waning and as he worried about the Communist Party becoming ossified and corrupted by years in power, he launched the Cultural Revolution. Ms. Jiang was involved in the planning of the Cultural Revolution and came to play an increasingly important role in that period.         As Deputy Director of the Cultural Revolution Group, Ms. Jiang appeared at rallies beginning in 1966 and praised the Red Guards, young followers of Mao who were dragging the country into chaos. Her status rose, and she became firmly linked to the faction that favored prolonged revolution and class struggle.         She served on the party Politburo, was in charge of literature and the arts and promoted "revolutionary operas" and other works intended to foster a suitable ideological outlook.         Mao died in September 1976, and within a month she and the other members of the Gang of Four -- Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan -- were toppled in a virtual coup d'etat. There was widespread rejoicing in the streets. Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Yao apparently remain in prison, or at least in some form of house arrest. Steadfast in Her Views         For all the accusations that she was a callow opportunist, Ms. Jiang was one of the few top Chinese leaders over the last few decades who stuck to her views even when they were unpopular. Even Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, revered by many Chinese, bent with the political winds, but after she was arrested and faced the possibility of a death sentence, Ms. Jiang did not renounce her fervent Maoism.         "I was Chairman Mao's dog," she said in her defense. "Whomever he told me to bite, I bit."         After a famous show trial that began in November 1980, Ms. Jiang was sentenced to death, with a two-year reprieve. This was commuted to life imprisonment, and the New China News Agency said in its dispatch today that she had been "out of custody and receiving medical treatment since May 1984."         Earlier this year, an official Chinese newspaper suggested in a rare report about Ms. Jiang that she was still adamantly opposed to the present Government policies. The newspaper, the Hainan Daily, wrote that she "twists her lips, snorts and even says some nonsense like 'This is not the Chairman's revolutionary line.' "         While it might seem strange that the Communist Party leadership could continue to hail Mao during the 1980's while excoriating and imprisoning his widow, the two were not close by the time Ms. Jiang achieved power. By the 1970's they lived apart, and a Chinese book published last year asserted that Ms. Jiang had to request permission from the party Central Committee's Work Office to see her husband. Interviews With U.S. Scholar         Some of the best insights into Ms. Jiang came from a remarkable series of interviews she gave in 1972 to an American scholar, Roxane Witke. Ms. Jiang apparently was attempting to bolster her stature with the interviews. Rivals denounced her for making unauthorized statements, and in the end the interviews hurt her badly.         Jiang Qing, named Li Jin at her birth in March 1914, told Ms. Witke that she had had a miserable childhood. Her mother was a concubine and her father a small-town landowner who beat mother and daughter until they fled home.         At age 14 she joined an underground theater troupe in Shandong Province. At age 16, bereft even of underwear, she went off to Beijing with a traveling theatrical group without consulting her mother. She said that she made contact with the Communists in Qingdao, a port city in Shandong, and that she joined the party in 1932.         In Shanghai, the most exciting city in China in those days, Ms. Jiang played bit parts in a variety of plays, and later films, as well as a few larger roles. One of her roles was that of Nora, the rebellious modern woman, in Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's House," which was then very much in fashion in China.         Actors were then scorned in China, but the theater was dominated by leftist politics and increased her political awareness. She also married or lived with at least two men in this period, and in later years she went to great effort to cover up her early romances and failures. She also sought during the Cultural Revolution to punish anyone who had looked down on her during her Shanghai days.         She asserted that she had been kidnapped by Nationalist agents and held for eight months; whether or not that was true, she did flee Shanghai for the Communist base at Yanan, where she met Mao.         After the triumph of the revolution in 1949, she, like other Communist leaders, developed a taste for luxury. Even during the Cultural Revolution, when she was hailing egalitarianism and posing for pictures doing agricultural labor, she enjoyed foreign films, gourmet meals and the use of a private airplane.         There were rumors in recent years that Ms. Jiang was suffering from throat cancer and that she was refusing to be treated, but it was unclear if this was life-threatening.         Her only known child was a daughter, Li Na, fathered by Mao. According to a Chinese account, Li Na visited Ms. Jiang regularly in Qincheng Prison in the early 1980's but refused to write to the authorities to request her release.         At her daughter's refusal, Ms. Jiang is said to have hurled a watermelon to the ground and protested: "Even you do not care for me. You are heartless."       
         Sylvia F. Porter, the author and newspaper columnist who gained wide readership by making business and financial news easy for the general public to understand, died on Wednesday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. She was 77 years old.         She died of complications from emphysema, her husband, James Fox, said.         Miss Porter, who wrote more than a score of books on investment, taxes and other economic subjects, also reached 40 million readers through her column on personal finance. It was syndicated by The Los Angeles Times and carried five days a week by 450 newspapers around the world.         From the mid-1930's, when her column began appearing regularly in The New York Post, Miss Porter specialized in reporting events of the financial and business worlds in terms that translated what she called their "bafflegab." Her arrival on the economic scene came at a propitious time: the public was slowly recovering from deep disillusionment with a Wall Street community that many blamed for plunging the country into the Great Depression.         In 1978 she moved her column from The Post to The Daily News, where it continued under the title "Your Money."  Molded by 1929 Market Crash         Miss Porter was born into a Russian-Jewish family in Patchogue, L.I., on June 18, 1913. Her father was a physician, and her mother became a successful milliner. She grew up in Brooklyn and was a freshman at Hunter College who intended to major in English literature and history when the stock market crashed in 1929.         Her mother had invested $30,000 in the bull market of the late 1920's and lost it all. The daughter rethought her career goals and plunged into the study of economics. She earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at Hunter and graduated magna cum laude in 1932, the same year that she and Reed F. Porter, a bank employee, were married.         She went to work for a small investment counseling firm in Wall Street and gained firsthand knowledge of the stock and bond markets, currency fluctuations, business cycles and other financial basics. She also took graduate courses at the New York University School of Business Administration.         She began writing in specialized financial journals, using the byline S. F. Porter to conceal the fact that she was a woman in a field then dominated by men. In 1934 she wrote a weekly column in The American Banker on United States Government securities and soon started her own information service on Government bonds. A Crusader Role Adopted         In 1935 Miss Porter began an occasional column in The New York Post on financial news. In a matter of months she was a regular writer on Wall Street for the paper, and in 1936 she was appointed financial editor. She wrote a daily column that was published under the title "S. F. Porter Says."         Miss Porter became a crusader against what she perceived as economic injustice. She bluntly criticized Government officials for their fiscal policies, at one point asking in an article in The American Banker whether the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., had been guily of "obstinacy, stupidity or sheer ill advice" in managing Government bonds.         Mr. Morgenthau, like many other figures in the economic world, was unaware that S. F. Porter was a woman. When he did find out, and when officials acknowledged that many of her barbs were justified, he sent her a bouquet of roses.         Other Washington figures were not so forgiving. When she attacked Senator Edwin Johnson of Colorado for his advocacy of silver, he called her "the biggest liar in the United States." Author of Many Books         In 1939 she wrote the first of her many successful books, "How to Make Money in Government Bonds." The book combined her inside knowledge with a popular style, making her information useful to professionals and at the same time accessible to the public.         In her second book, "If War Comes to the American Home," published in 1941 on the eve of America's entry into World War II, she drew on the experience of World War I to tell families how they might be affected in a war economy.         A reviewer in The New York Times summed up her approach this way: "Facts, figures, broad word-pictures and succinct arguments are all presented with conversational ease."         Although her books were published under her full name and she had been heard on radio, it was not until 1942 that The Post changed the title of her column to "Sylvia F. Porter." The newspaper's acknowledgement of her sex brought prominence on the lecture circuit and requests for articles from women's magazines and periodicals of general circulation.         Her column was syndicated, beginning in 1947, and she collaborated with the tax specialist J. K. Lasser on financial handbooks for taxpayers, as well as with other specialists on parallel projects in various economic fields.  Posthumous Book Planned         In 1975 she published "Sylvia Porter's Money Book: How to Earn It, Spend It, Save It, Invest It, Borrow It and Use It to Better Your Life." It sold more than a million copies. Her most recent book, "Sylvia Porter's Your Finances in the 1990's," appeared last year, and her last book, "Planning Your Retirement," is to be published in September.         Not all Miss Porter's ventures were successful. In 1984 she started a magazine, Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance, which rapidly became the third largest periodical in its field, behind Time Inc.'s Money and the Kiplinger organization's Changing Times. But the stock-market plunge in 1987 dealt her publication a lethal blow, and in 1989 its list of 400,000 subscribers was bought by Kiplinger.         Miss Porter's second husband, G. Sumner Collins, died in 1977. Besides Mr. Fox, a public-relations counsel, she is survived by a daughter, Chris Del Cuore of Norway, Me.; a stepson, Sumner Collins of Medical Lake, Wash.; a brother, Dr. John L. Feldman, a physician of Palos Verdes, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Anita Hart Balter, an artist and writer well known for her role in fostering the arts in the Hudson Valley, died on June 29 at her home in Garrison, N.Y.         Mrs. Balter, who was 57 years old and also lived in Palm Beach, Fla., died of complications from breast cancer, a family spokesman said.         Her activities were directed at both art and broader community development. She was the founder and operator of Gallery Forecast, now defunct, in Peekskill, in which well-known sculptors chose emerging talent for exhibition to draw the attention of the many corporate headquarters in the region.         Mrs. Balter, who was born in Amsterdam and moved to the United States with her family just before World War II, was also on the board of the Garrison Art Center, where she established a Scholarship and Mentor Program in which artists worked with promising local pupils. In 1987 she was a founding board member of the Hudson Valley Shakespeare Festival.         She is survived by her husband, Lee; her mother, Jenny Hart; a brother, Herbert Hart of Monte Carlo, Monaco; and, by a former marriage, a daughter, Elise Hart of Berkeley, Calif., and two sons, Michael Sheffrin of Majorca, and Ivan Sheffrin of Washington, and a grandson.       
         Mildred Dunnock, the actress best known for her performances in stage and screen productions of "Death of a Salesman," died Friday evening at Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Oak Bluffs, Mass. She was 90 years old, said her daughter, Linda McGuire.         Her daughter said that Miss Dunnock died of old age. She lived in West Tisbury, Mass.         Miss Dunnock was nominated for Academy Awards for her film performances as Linda Loman, the salesman's wife, in "Death of a Salesman" (1951) and for her performance in Tennessee Williams's "Baby Doll" (1956).         She was small and slight with a thin, mobile mouth, and she excelled at playing the parts of mothers and eccentric ladies of various kinds. Her admirers praised her power to move audiences by making them care for the characters she portrayed.  Broadway's First Linda Loman         Miss Dunnock originated the Linda Loman role on the stage, appearing with Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman in the 1949 Broadway production of "Death of a Salesman," by Arthur Miller. She later played that part in the film, in regional productions and on television.         Appraising the film, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times that "as the long-suffering wife, Mildred Dunnock is simply superb, as she was on the stage" in her "portrayal of a woman who bears the agony of seeing her sons and husband turn out failures."         In an interview late in her career, Miss Dunnock observed: "I like to play parts that are not like myself. I'm not the least bit exciting. I'm an ordinary person in an ordinary life, but in my imagination there's no stopping me."         Among her other major portrayals were Lavinia in Lillian Hellman's "Another Part of the Forest," Big Mama in Tennessee Williams's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," and Miss Ronberry in "The Corn Is Green," a 1940 Emlyn Williams play starring Ethel Barrymore.  Many New Haven Productions         Miss Dunnock performed in numerous stage productions at the Long Wharf theater in New Haven over the decades, including the parts of Mrs. Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and the mother in Mr. Williams's "Glass Menagerie."         She taught in the late 1960's at the Yale Drama School. Over the years she also taught at Barnard College and at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         Mildred Dunnock was born in Baltimore Jan. 25, 1901, her daughter said. She earned an A.B. degree from Goucher College there and an M.A. from Columbia. She first appeared on Broadway in the early 1930's.         She became, as one New York Times writer, Warren Hoge, put it in 1976, "an institution among first-nighters, the creator of several major characters in American dramatic literature, a performer studied and revered by younger actors and actresses."         She is survived by her husband of almost 60 years, Keith Urmy, who is a retired executive of Chemical Bank in Manhattan; their daughter, Linda McGuire, an actress who teaches at the Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven; a granddaughter, Patricia McGuire, an actress who is a member of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., and two grandsons.       
         Mildred Dunnock, the actress best known for her performances in stage and screen productions of "Death of a Salesman," died Friday evening at Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Oak Bluffs, Mass. She was 90 years old, said her daughter, Linda McGuire.         Her daughter said that Miss Dunnock died of old age. She lived in West Tisbury, Mass.         Miss Dunnock was nominated for Academy Awards for her film performances as Linda Loman, the salesman's wife, in "Death of a Salesman" (1951) and for her performance in Tennessee Williams's "Baby Doll" (1956).         She was small and slight with a thin, mobile mouth, and she excelled at playing the parts of mothers and eccentric ladies of various kinds. Her admirers praised her power to move audiences by making them care for the characters she portrayed.  Broadway's First Linda Loman         Miss Dunnock originated the Linda Loman role on the stage, appearing with Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman in the 1949 Broadway production of "Death of a Salesman," by Arthur Miller. She later played that part in the film, in regional productions and on television.         Appraising the film, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times that "as the long-suffering wife, Mildred Dunnock is simply superb, as she was on the stage" in her "portrayal of a woman who bears the agony of seeing her sons and husband turn out failures."         In an interview late in her career, Miss Dunnock observed: "I like to play parts that are not like myself. I'm not the least bit exciting. I'm an ordinary person in an ordinary life, but in my imagination there's no stopping me."         Among her other major portrayals were Lavinia in Lillian Hellman's "Another Part of the Forest," Big Mama in Mr. Williams's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," and Miss Ronberry in "The Corn Is Green," a 1940 Emlyn Williams play starring Ethel Barrymore.  Many New Haven Productions         Miss Dunnock performed in numerous stage productions at the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven over the decades, including the parts of Mrs. Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and the mother in Mr. Williams's "Glass Menagerie."         She taught in the late 1960's at the Yale Drama School. Over the years she also taught at Barnard College and at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         Mildred Dunnock was born in Baltimore Jan. 25, 1901, her daughter said. She earned an A.B. degree from Goucher College there and an M.A. from Columbia. She first appeared on Broadway in the early 1930's.         She became, as one New York Times writer, Warren Hoge, put it in 1976, "an institution among first-nighters, the creator of several major characters in American dramatic literature, a performer studied and revered by younger actors and actresses."         She is survived by her husband of almost 60 years, Keith Urmy, who is a retired executive of Chemical Bank in Manhattan; their daughter, Linda McGuire, an actress who teaches at the Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven; a granddaughter, Patricia McGuire, an actress who is a member of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., and two grandsons.       
         Lee Remick, the elegant actress who illumined dozens of films and many stage and television plays, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 55 years old.         The actress died of cancer after fighting the disease for two years, a spokesman for the family said. In one of her last public appearances, a star was dedicated in her honor in April on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.         Ms. Remick, an uncommonly versatile performer, portrayed characters as disparate as a seductive cheerleader and a tormented alcoholic, along with such historical figures as Lady Randolph Churchill and Eleanor Roosevelt.         Once billed as "America's answer to Brigitte Bardot," she was as much admired for her acting abilities as for her bubbly attractiveness. Writing in The New York Times of her performance in the 1980 television movie "The Women's Room," John J. O'Connor said, "Lee Remick proves once again she is an uncommonly gifted actress whose somewhat fragile, almost stereotyped good looks tend to distract one from that fact."         Ms. Remick, who was born in Quincy, Mass., studied dance as a child and won her first acting job at age 16 with a summer-stock company on nearby Cape Cod. This led to a part in a short-lived Broadway comedy, "Be Your Age," in 1953, several more summer-theater appearances and a string of television roles on "Philco Playhouse," "Hallmark Hall of Fame," "Playhouse 90" and other programs in the mid-1950's. 'I Chucked School'         Later in her career, when asked about her decision to give up school in favor of acting, she said: "I'd cut classes to go to rehearsals, then stay up all night studying, but it wasn't working, and one day a very kind teacher advised me to choose one or the other. I guess the strain was showing. Anyway, it was an easily made decision. I chucked school, told my parents and then slept for 10 days."         After the director Elia Kazan cast Ms. Remick as a seductive cheerleader in his 1957 film, "A Face in the Crowd," she gave highly praised performances in Martin Ritt's "Long Hot Summer" (1958), Otto Preminger's "Anatomy of a Murder" (1959) and Mr. Kazan's "Wild River" (1960). Her portrait of a happily married housewife turned alcoholic in Blake Edwards's "Days of Wine and Roses" (1963) brought her an Academy Award nomination. Subsequent film roles included "Baby the Rain Must Fall" (1965), "Loot" (1972), "Sometimes a Great Notion" (1972) and "The Europeans" (1979).         She chose her roles with care. "After 'Anatomy,' in which I played a kind of tramp, for instance, I could have followed up with more of the same," she told an interviewer. "Reinforcing my 'image' by becoming a sex symbol would have been one way to be more strongly identified as a star, but I had no interest in doing that. I can't be something I'm not." On Broadway and Television         Ms. Remick's most successful Broadway performance was in Frederick Knott's 1966 thriller, "Wait Until Dark," about a blind woman at the mercy of three criminals. Her other stage credits included "Anyone Can Whistle," the 1964 musical by Arthur Laurents and Stephen Sondheim, and a Boston production of John Pielmeier's play "Agnes of God" in 1982.         Ms. Remick was a frequent star in television mini-series in the 1970's and 80's. She played the title role in "Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill" (1975) and also starred in "Ike" (1979), "Haywire" (1980), "Toughlove" (1985) and "Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder" (1987).         Reviewing Ms. Remick's performance in "Nutcracker," a 1987 NBC mini-series in which she played a woman who manipulates her son into committing murder, Mr. O'Connor wrote in The New York Times: "If she had been born with Bette Davis eyes or Katharine Hepburn cheekbones, she might long ago have been recognized as one of this country's most outstanding dramatic actresses."  Of Preparation and Humility         Ms. Remick was known to prepare intensively for her roles, attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous for her work in "Days of Wine and Roses" and spending a month of blindfolded mornings at New York's Lighthouse for the Blind before starring in "Wait Until Dark."         "I'm really a housewife who is incidentally an actress," Ms. Remick told an interviewer. On another occasion she said: "People tell me that I have a special quality in films, but if I do I take no intellectual credit for it. It's pure instinct. I think I've held on to certain qualities within myself which have been strong."         Ms. Remick's marriage to William A. Colleran, a producer and director, ended in divorce in 1969. Her survivors include her husband of 21 years, Kip Gowans, a producer; a daughter, Kate Colleran Sullivan; a son, Matthew Remick Colleran; two stepdaughters, Justine Gowans Solly and Nicola Gowans, and her mother, Pat Packard.         Correction:  July 29, 1991, Monday         An obituary on July 3 about the actress Lee Remick omitted one of her survivors. He is her brother Bruce Waldo Remick of Springfield, Va.       
         Barbara J. Eichner, director of the Family Life Center of the Hackensack Medical Center in New Jersey, died on Saturday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 52 years old and lived in Closter, N.J.         Mrs. Eichner died of breast cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Committed to helping the victims of child abuse and neglect throughout her career, she joined the center as director in 1988. From 1977 to 1988, she was director of the Family Center of the Passaic County Mental Health Center.         She was born in Brookline, Mass., and graduated from Barnard College in 1960. She received a master's degree from the Columbia School of Social Work in 1963.         Her husband, Alfred, died in 1988.         She is survived by two sons, Matthew, of Closter, and James, of Washington; her mother, Florence Aranov of Ridgewood, N.J., and a sister, Janet Bauer, of Ridgewood.       
         Carol Rubinstein Schickel, a television producer and theatrical lighting designer, died on Saturday at Century City Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 51 years old.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Richard Schickel, the film critic. .         As a husband-and-wife team, Ms. Rubinstein and Mr. Schickel co-produced several television specials, including "Minnelli on Minnelli: Liza Remembers Vincente" for the Public Broadcasting Service and "Gary Cooper: American Life, American Legend" for Turner Network Television. She also co-produced the filmed sequences for the last two Academy Award broadcasts.         Ms. Rubinstein was born in Troy, Ohio, and received a Master of Arts from the Yale Drama School. She was a lighting designer for several regional theaters, including the Williamstown (Mass.) Theater Festival and the Whole Theater Company of Montclair, N.J. Her Off Broadway credits include such shows as "Now Is the Time" and "The Last Sweet Days of Isaac." On Broadway she was the assistant lighting designer for "Jesus Christ, Superstar," "Pippin" and a 1982 revival of "Othello."         Her first marriage, to Arthur B. Rubinstein, a composer, ended in divorce.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Charlotte Foy, of Troy; a daughter, Alexandra Rubinstein, of Pasadena, Calif., and two step-daughters, Erika Schickel, of Los Angeles, and Jessica Schickel, of Northampton, Mass.       
         Irina Nijinska, a dancer and teacher who spent much of her life in a one-woman crusade to preserve the choreography of her mother, Bronislava Nijinska, died on Tuesday at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, Calif. She was 77 years old and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif.         She died of cardiac arrest, her husband, Gibbs S. Raetz, said.         Miss Nijinska's career was devoted to the championing of a single choreographer. She believed, as did most dance historians, that her mother -- who first achieved acclaim with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the 1920's -- was among this century's greatest choreographers. And she traveled the world reviving the elder Nijinska's works with selfless devotion.         In New York she staged productions for the Feld Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem. She was also a familiar figure in companies as diverse as the Paris Opera Ballet, the Stuttgart Ballet, the National Ballet of Holland, Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, Tulsa Ballet Theater and the Dance Corps of the State University of New York at Purchase.         She most often revived two contrasting masterpieces by her mother: "Les Noces," a monumentally scaled depiction of a peasant wedding choreographed in 1923, and "Les Biches," a satire on the French Riviera "smart set" that received its premiere in 1924. In 1981, under Miss Nijinska's supervision, the Oakland Ballet became the first American company to perform "Les Noces." Four years later, the Feld Ballet danced it in New York and in 1989 it entered the repertories of the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem.  Collaborative Efforts         That year, the Harlem company offered an all-Bronislava Nijinska program of "Les Noces," "Les Biches" and "Rondo Capriccioso," which Irina Nijinska revived in association with the ballerina Rosella Hightower. In 1989, Irina Nijinska and Frank W. D. Ries, a dance historian, reconstructed another satire, "Le Train Bleu," for the Oakland Ballet.         Wherever she went, Irina Nijinska amazed people with her inexhaustible vitality. She was a warmhearted, gregarious woman, and dancers who began by respecting her as a mentor came to cherish her as a friend. Although acquainted since childhood with famous choreographers and artists, she remained modest in manner. Typically, when a reporter asked if she wished to be addressed as Madame Nijinska, she laughed and replied, "Call me Irina. In our family, there is only         one         Madame Nijinska."         It was a distinguished family. Her uncle was the legendary dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, and her father, Alexander Kotchetovsky,was also a dancer.         Miss Nijinska was born in St. Petersburg on Oct. 20, 1913, but received most of her training, from her mother and other teachers, in Paris. She made her debut with the Olga Spessivtzeva Ballet in 1930 and, adopting Nijinska as her professional surname, danced during the 30's with the ballet ensemble of the Opera Russe a Paris, the Ida Rubinstein Ballet, the Theatre de la Danse, Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes and the Polish Ballet. Was Her Mother's Assistant         After an automobile accident in 1936 that reduced her performing abilities, she served as her mother's rehearsal assistant, and from 1941 to 1950 taught in the school her mother had founded in Hollywood. Miss Nijinska married Mr. Raetz, an aeronautical engineer, in 1946, and for much of the 1950's and 60's devoted herself to her family. When Nicholas Singaevsky, her mother's second husband, died in 1968, she once more became her mother's assistant, and after her mother's death in 1972 she embarked upon her travels as a choreographic reconstructor.         In recent years, Miss Nijinska had sifted through her mother's notes to determine precisely how many works by Bronislava Nijinska were revivable. With the aid of Nina Youshkevitch, a New York teacher who had danced in ballets by Bronislava Nijinska in the 30's, she staged an excerpt from "Le Baiser de la Fee" last fall for a symposium sponsored by the Dance Critics Association and the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. At the time of her death, she was hoping to revive "Bolero," "Chopin Concerto" and "Impressions de Music Hall."         Miss Nijinska and Jean Rawlinson translated and edited "Early Memories," the first volume of Bronislava Nijinska's autobiography, which was published in 1981. Miss Nijinska was in the process of editing a sequel.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Natalie Raetz of Long Beach, Calif., and a son, George Raetz of Denver.       
         Bernice Falk, director of training and staff development for the Jewish Child Care Association of New York, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73 years old.         She died of a brain tumor, her family said.         Mrs. Falk joined the association in 1968 and was assistant director in charge of social services at its Cottage School in Pleasantville, N.Y., until 1989, when she took over the training post at the headquarters in Manhattan.         She was born in Tulsa, Okla., graduated from the University of Texas and held a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work of Columbia University.         Mrs. Falk is survived by her mother, Helen Stephens of College Station, Tex.; a stepson, Peter, of Manhattan, and a brother, Richard Stephens of College Station.       
         E. Tamu Bess, a former special assistant to Basil Patterson when he was deputy mayor of New York City and New York State Secretary of State, died on Aug. 1 in Midway Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 39 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Bess died in surgery after being shot in an attempted robbery in front of the home of a colleague, the Los Angeles police said.         Before Ms. Bess moved to Los Angeles last year, she had worked in politics, philanthropy, social service and the arts in New York City.         In politics, in addition to her work with Mr. Patterson, she helped organize the New York City Black Political Convention in 1982. She had been executive director of the Twenty-First Century Foundation, established to finance eceonomic development in black communities, and was a board member of the Black United Fund. She also helped restructure the summer camp and after-school programs of Minisink Town House, a Harlem settlement house that she attended as a child.         Ms. Bess had worked to produce the 10th anniversary program of the Black Filmmaker Foundation and was talent coordinator for "Spike & Company: Do It A Cappella," broadcast last year by PBS.         In Los Angeles, she worked in film publicity.         In the 1970's she took the name Tamu, which means sweetness in Swahili, and used the initial of her given first name, Evna.         She is survived by her mother, Dorothy T. Ellington Ashley of Washington, and her brother, David Ellington of Los Angeles.       
         Sylvia Petit Maples, the director of community services at the National Association of Drug Abuse Problems in New York, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan.         She was 45 years old and died of liver cancer, according to a statement from the association.         Ms. Maples was the co-founder and former chairwoman of the Association of Vocational Rehabilitation Advocates for Substance Abusers, the first organization formed exclusively to help with jobs for recovering drug abusers.         Ms. Maples earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the City College of New York.         She is survived by her mother, Mary Petit of Pawling, N.Y.; four sisters, Cordella Pascariello of Freeport, L.I., Cassandra DeFillippo of Pawling, Renee Glover of New Rochelle, and Sarita Petit of the Bronx, and a brother, Peter Petit of San Francisco.       
         Marietta Tree, a daughter of privilege who won plaudits as a representative to the United Nations in the 1960's and as a tireless worker for New York City causes, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, her son-in-law, James Sterba, said.         Mrs. Tree was appointed a representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1961 and served also as a special adviser to the United States delegation. She remained at the United Nations until 1967, serving in several         posts, including delegate to the Trusteeship Council.         In the last decade, she was chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a group that tries to help neighborhood groups improve their communities.  She resigned her post because of illness nine months ago.         Mrs. Tree came from a distinguished family and privileged circumstances and could have spent her life quite insulated from the tensions of international diplomacy and the frustrations of a city that so frequently seemed to be in crisis. But that is not what she wanted. Tributes From Friends         Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, a close friend of Mrs. Tree's for many years, said: "Her ambition was to be a combination of Mrs. Roosevelt and Carole Lombard. And that is what she was."         Another close friend agreed. "She was elegant, glorious and sparkling," saidOsborne Elliot, who was founding chairman of the Citizens Committee and who, since her resignation, has returned as chairman. "She set many drawing rooms         afire. But more importantly, she cared deeply about the world, the nation, this city and its people."         Mrs. Tree was born in Lawrence, Mass., the daughter of the Right Rev. Malcolm Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal clergyman, who from 1940 to 1962 was Bishop for Central New York State of the Episcopal Church. Her mother was the former Mary Parkman, daughter of a prominent New England family.         The family believed that it was a responsibility to dedicate at least some of one's life to public service, and the message was received by all five of their children. One of Mrs. Tree's brothers, Endicott, became Governor of Massachusetts.         The Peabodys moved around a bit before World War II. For a time they lived in Philadelphia, where Mr. Peabody was minister of St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill and young Marietta attended Springside Academy. She also attended St. Timothy's School in Baltimore and the Petite Ecole Florentine in Florence, Italy. From 1936 to 1939, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she concentrated in political science.         In 1939, she married Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer and conservative Republican. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. The couple had a daughter, Frances FitzGerald, an author whose nonfiction best-seller "Fire in the Lake,"         about the Vietnam War, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.         Soon after the divorce, Marietta married Ronald Tree, a former Conservative member of the British Parliament. He died in 1976. The two had a daughter, Penelope Tree, who became a model.         During World War II Mrs. Tree worked as a researcher at Life magazine. After the war she became active in liberal Democratic politics in New York. She was on the New York State Democratic Committee from 1954 to 1960 and was one of Adlai E. Stevenson's chief aides when he ran for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.         After John F. Kennedy was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Tree to the United Nations job, where she served when Mr. Stevenson was the top United States representative there.         "I work in the political field because I believe that everyone in a community has duties as well as rights," Mrs. Tree said in 1961. "I am impelled by a feeling that I have so many blessings I must somehow try to pay for them in hard         work for the community and in gratitude for being an American. I have to try and pay my debt to God."         After her diplomatic service ended, Mrs. Tree became increasingly interested in urban problems. She was a partner in the city planning firm of Llewelyn-Davies Associates, a British organization, and ran its New York office from 1968 to 1980. She was neither an architect nor a planner but rather, as her brother, Malcolm, recalls it, "a rainmaker" who was able to motivate city officials. She worked on a slum rehabilitation project in Manila and consulted on various projects in Hong Kong, Borneo, Beirut and elsewhere. Held New York City Post         Her interest in New York City was evident early on. In 1944 she was one of the founders of Sydenham Hospital, then hailed as the first interracial voluntary hospital in the United States. Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her to the city's Commission on Intergroup Relations in 1959.         Among her other activites was service on the board of directors of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Foundation, the Marconi International Foundation and the Winston Churchill Foundation. She also was on the boards of         CBS and Pan American World Airways.         Among the survivors are her daughters, Frances FitzGerald of Manhattan and Penelope Tree of Sydney, Australia; four brothers, Endicott, of Hollis, N.H.; George L., of Washington, an educational consultant; , Samuel P., of Manhattan, a philanthropist, and Malcolm E., of Washington, a real-estate developer.         Funeral arrangements are incomplete. Mrs. Tree will be cremated and her remains buried in Northeast Harbor, Me. There will be a memorial service in New York City in September, but the date and location have not yet been selected, the family said.         Correction:  August 17, 1991, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Marietta Tree, a former United Nations representative and campaigner for New York City causes, rendered the name of the founding chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City incorrectly. He is Osborn Elliott.       
         Erma Campbell, an actress in theater, television and films, died on Tuesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. She was 49 years old.         She died of cancer, said Margo Britton, a friend of the family.         Ms. Campbell appeared in a number of Off Broadway and regional theater productions. In 1990, she won praise for her portrayal of a blues singer in "Ground People," an Off Broadway play about a black minstrel troupe in the 1920's.         She appeared on television in the soap operas "The Guiding Light" and "All My Children," and had a small role in the Woody Allen film "Zelig."         She is survived by her mother, Addie Hutchins of Los Angeles; two sons, Darrin and Raymond, and a daughter, Tracey, all of New York City, and three grandchildren.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died last night at her home in South Salem, N.Y., The Associated Press reported. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Dewhurst was pronounced dead by her personal physician, said Jan Stutts, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office. The cause of death was not immediately available.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten." She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses.         Her most recent New York appearances were on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in "Ah, Wilderness!," and as O'Neill's wife, Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1987. Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until last May.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant to use her distinctive, big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings." Born in Canada         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee Downer College, a girls' school, and decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side, shortly before he moved to Central Park. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice. Start of a Team         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming young performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two children, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Her first Broadway role with lines came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero. Starring With Jason Robards         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Ms. Dewhurst's other Broadway credits include the 1983 revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's comedy "You Can't Take It With You," in which she co-starred with Mr. Robards; O'Neill's "More Stately Mansions," with Ingrid Bergman in 1967; Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson McCullers's "Ballad of the Sad Cafe," in 1963, and a revival of Mr. Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," with Ben Gazzara and directed by Mr. Albee, for which she was nominated for a Tony in 1977.         She also appeared in many productions for Mr. Papp's Shakespeare Festival, including an "Antony and Cleopatra" in Central Park in 1963 without Mr. Scott (Michael Higgins played Antony) and stagings of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth." Her other Off Broadway plays include Athol Fugard's "Hello and Goodbye," in which she co-starred with Martin Sheen in 1969 and won a Drama Desk Award.         Her many films include Woody Allen's "Annie Hall"; "The Cowboys" and "McQ" with John Wayne; "Tribute" with Jack Lemmon; "The Nun's Story"; "A Fine Madness," and "Ice Castles."         She performed in the recent movie "Dying Young" with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!" Numerous TV Roles         On television she was seen with Candice Bergen on "Murphy Brown" in the last three seasons as Murphy's mother, Avery Brown, winning an Emmy Award in 1989. Her other television credits include productions of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," two Arthur Miller plays, "The Price" and "The Crucible," "No Exit," "The Women's Room," "As Is," "Anne of Green Gables," "Anne of Avonlea" and "Lantern Hill." She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about the most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to Campbell Scott, she is survived by another son, Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer, and two grandchildren.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses, whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died Thursday night at her home in South Salem, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of cancer, said her son Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill. She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten."         Her most recent New York appearances were in 1987, as O'Neill's wife Carlotta Monterey O'Neill in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival, and on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in his "Ah, Wilderness!"  Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of the Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until May of this year.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant about using her distinctive big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings."         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee-Downer Collegewhere she decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice.         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two sons, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Ms. Dewhurst's first major Broadway role came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero.

Among her many screen credits was the recent movie "Dying Young," with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!"         Her television appearances included three seasons playing Candice Bergen's mother on "Murphy Brown," for which she won an Emmy Award in 1989. She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.

         Carol H. Lefcourt, a prominent New York City lawyer and women's rights advocate who drafted much of New York's landmark child-support legislation, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said Harriet N. Cohen, a lawyer and the co-chairwoman of the Coalition on Women's Legal Issues, which Ms. Lefcourt co-founded in 1986.         Ms. Lefcourt graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1968 and was a founding partner of the now-defunct New York Law Commune of Lefcourt, Garfinkle, Crain, Cohen, Sandler, Lefcourt, Kraft and Stolar. Taught at Brooklyn Law         In 1973, she was the founding partner of one of the first all-women law firms, Lefcourt, Kraft and Arber. She has also been an adjunct professor law at the Brooklyn Law School for the last decade.         Ms. Lefcourt served as the general counsel for the Governor's Office, the New York State Division for Women from 1984 to 1989. In that position, she authored legislation that raised the amount of financial support that children must receive after their parents divorce to the highest level in the nation.         She received the Susan B. Anthony Award from the National Organization for Women in February 1990. She was also the editor of "Women and the Law" (Clark-Boardman, 1984), which was cited by the Association of American Publishers as the best law book of that year.         Ms. Lefcourt is survived by her husband of 26 years, Robert, of New York City; a daughter, Jenny; a son, Daniel; her mother, Marjorie Hoffman of New York City, and a sister, Elaine Hoffman Rattet of New Rochelle, N.Y.       
         Aline (Honi) Pollitzer Weiss, active for more than half a century with organizations concerned with the welfare of children, died on Sunday at her summer home in Stephentown, N.Y. She was 95 years old and lived in Medford, N.J.         She died in her sleep, her son-in-law, Judge Louis Pollak of Philadelphia, said.         For many years, Mrs. Weiss was chairwoman of the board of the Wiltwyck School for Boys. She was also on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development, Louise Wise Services and the Encampment for Citizenship, a youth leadership development group.         She came from a family with a tradition of social involvement. Her mother, Alice Kohn Pollitzer, one of nine women in Barnard College's first graduating class, founded the Encampment for Citizenship. Her sister, Margaret Pollitzer Hoben, helped found the Walden School.         When she was 70, Mrs. Weiss and her mother, on principle, challenged a Federal Government provision that required Medicare applicants to sign a loyalty oath. In 1967, while their challenge moved through the court system, the Justice Department conceded that the oath was unconstitutional.         Mrs. Weiss's husband, Louis, died in 1950. She is survived by two daughters, Elizbeth W. Goldwasser of Urbana, Ill., and Katherine W. Pollak of Philadelphia; a son, Dr. William P. Weiss of Chester, Vt., 18 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         E. Tamu Bess, a former special assistant to Basil Patterson when he was deputy mayor of New York City and New York State Secretary of State, died Aug. 1 in Midway Hospital Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 39 years old and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Bess died in surgery after being shot in an attempted robbery in front of the home of a colleague, the Los Angeles police said.         Before Ms. Bess moved to Los Angeles last year, she had worked in politics, philanthropy, social service and the arts in New York City.         In politics, in addition to her work with Mr. Patterson, she helped organize the New York City Black Political Convention in 1982. She had been executive director of the Twenty-First Century Foundation, established to finance eceonomic development in black communities, and was a board member of the Black United Fund. She also helped restructure the summer camp and after-school programs of Minisink Town House, a Harlem settlement house that she attended as a child.         Ms. Bess had worked to produce the 10th anniversary program of the Black Filmmaker Foundation and was talent coordinator for "Spike & Company: Do It A Cappella," broadcast last year by PBS.         In Los Angeles, she worked in film publicity.         In the 1970's she took the name Tamu, which means sweetness in Swahili, and used the initial of her given first name, Evna.         She is survived by her mother, Dorothy T. Ellington Ashley of Washington, and her brother, David Ellington of Los Angeles.       
         Susan Price Carr, a lawyer with Time Warner Inc., died on Friday at Beth Israel Hospital North in Manhattan. She was 45 years old.         She died of breast cancer, family members said.         In the early 1970's, Ms. Carr was one of several female law students who filed sex discrimination claims against several large law firms. The suits were settled by the firms' adoption of procedures to assure equal opportunities in hiring for future generations of law students.         Ms. Carr had been litigation counsel for Warner Communications, now Time Warner, since 1981. She was a graduate of Vassar College and of Columbia Law School, and she had received a master's degree in political science from New York University.         Ms. Carr is survived by her husband, Anthony M. Radice; a daughter, Julia; her mother, Dorislee Kadis Carr, and a half-sister, Amy, all of New York City.       
         Julie Bovasso, an actress and playwright in the avant-garde theater Off Broadway and Off Off Broadway, died Saturday at Tisch Hospital in Manhattan. She was 61 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Bovasso died of cancer, said her literary agent, Helen Harvey.         In the mid-1950's, Ms. Bovasso established the experimental Tempo Playhouse on St. Marks Place in Manhattan and introduced works of the Theater of the Absurd, including those of the playwrights Jean Genet, Eugene Ionesco and Michel de Ghelderode, to the professional theater in the United States. In the New York premiere of "The Maids" by Genet, she won an Obie Award as best Off Broadway actress in 1956.         Ms. Bovasso also won Drama Desk and Outer Critics Circle awards in 1972 as best actress for her performance in "The Screens" by Genet. 3 Obies in the Same Year         In 1970, she won three Obies, as best playwright, director and actress, for "Gloria and Esperanza," which opened at Cafe La Mama. When the work moved to the ANTA Theater on Broadway, Clive Barnes wrote in The New York Times that "it represents La Mama both at its most adventurous and at its most self-indulgent."         The writer Arthur Sainer, in the book "Contemporary Dramatists," described Ms. Bovasso as "a kind of mad mathematician, marshalling people and events into lunatic propositions and hallucinatory equations." Her other plays include "The Moon Dreamers," "Schubert's Last Serenade," "Monday on the Way to Mercury Island," "The Nothing Kid" and "Angelo's Wedding." Turbulent Productions         In 1973, Ms. Bovasso was hired to direct "In the Boom Boom Room" by David Rabe, the first production of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival at the Vivian Beaumont Theater at Lincoln Center. But she was replaced a few days before the play opened, and Mr. Papp became the director.         When "Angelo's Wedding" was presented by the Circle Repertory Company in 1985, several weeks of difficult relations among the playwright, the director and several cast members culminated in an altercation at the theater during a performance.         Marshall W. Mason, the theater's artistic director, said at the time that Ms. Bovasso attacked an intern and a house manager who had tried to evict her from the theater for disturbing the cast. At the beginning of Act III, Mr. Mason said, Ms. Bovasso went onstage to tell the audience to go home.         Ms. Bovasso was born in Brooklyn. She attended the High School of Music and Art and City College.         She is survived by her mother, Angela Bovasso of Staten Island, and a brother, Bernard X. Bovasso of Saugerties, N.Y.         Correction:  September 20, 1991, Friday         An obituary on Tuesday about the actress and playwright Julie Bovasso omitted the films in which she appeared. They include "Willie and Phil" (1980), "The Verdict" (1982), "Moonstruck" (1987) and "Betsy's Wedding" (1990).       
         Julia Jackson Christian Preston, a granddaughter of Thomas Jonathan (Stonewall) Jackson, the legendary Confederate general, died Sept. 15 at the Presbyterian Home in High Point, N.C. She was 104 years old.         Mrs. Preston was born in San Diego on June 5, 1887. Her mother, Julia Thomas Neal Christian, died when Mrs. Preston was a child and she was reared by her grandmother, Anna Morrison Jackson, General Jackson's second wife and widow.         She is survived by a son, Thomas Preston, of Silver Spring, Md.; three daughters, Mrs. Anna Shaffner of Fleetwood, N.C.; Mrs. Cortlandt Creech of Winston Salem, and Mrs. Julia McAfee of Jacksonville Beach, Fla.; 15 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 27, 1991, Friday         An obituary on Saturday about Julia Jackson Christian Preston, a granddaughter of Stonewall Jackson, misidentified her mother. She was Julia Thomas Jackson Christian.       
         Oona Chaplin, the daughter of one of the great tragic playwrights of the century, Eugene O'Neill, and wife of one of the screen's greatest comic geniuses, Charles Chaplin, died yesterday at the age of 66 in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland.         She died of cancer of the pancreas, said her lawyer, Herbert Jacoby of New York City.         Mrs. Chaplin, who became known as Lady Oona after her British-born husband was knighted in 1975, was an 18-year-old Brearley graduate and fledgling actress in 1943 when she became the fourth wife of the internationally beloved actor and director, who was then 54 years old. Their elopement so infuriated O'Neill, who was the same age as Chaplin, that he disinherited her.         The Chaplins, who had eight children, lived most of their married life in their 18th-century mansion overlooking Lake Geneva. After her husband's death in 1977, Mrs. Chaplin stayed on, becoming something of a recluse. Renounced Citizenship         Charles Chaplin, who grew up in the slums of London, championed leftist causes during the Cold War and was an ardent critic of the American Government.  In 1952 he went into self-imposed exile with his family. Two years later, it was learned that Mrs. Chaplin had renounced her American citzenship and become an English subject like her husband.         In 1967 Mrs. Chaplin returned to New York without fanfare to visit her mother, who was dying. Chaplin did not return to the United States until 1975, when he was received in triumph and given a special Oscar.         Throughout her life, Oona O'Neill Chaplin was a gracious, quiet presence overshadowed by her ebullient husband. Their home became a kind of intellectual watering hole; Pablo Casals, Nikita Khrushchev, Jawaharlal Nehru and Zhou Enlai were among those who visited the Chaplins in Switzerland.         As a young and somewhat sensitive society beauty, Oona O'Neill had her own following. When she visited the West Coast in her brief attempt to become an actress, she received long daily letters from an admirer named "Jerry" -- the author J. D. Salinger. 'Oriental Objectivity'         Her two best friends from Brearley also went to Hollywood and married famous older men. Carol Grace married the writer William Saroyan, and Gloria Vanderbilt married the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Gloria Vanderbilt once said of her fellow debutante that she possessed "a wonderful quality of oriental objectivity about life."         She met Chaplin through a Hollywood agent who recommended her for a part in a Chaplin movie. Chaplin later said he had considered her too inexperienced at first, but changed his mind when he heard that a studio had offered her a contract.         Mrs. Chaplin's parents had had a bitter divorce when she was 2, and she saw her father only infrequently as she grew up. She managed to survive her difficult childhood relatively unscathed, but her older brother, Shane, and a half-brother, Eugene O'Neill Jr., committed suicide.         Mrs. Chaplin always told friends and interviewers that she was content to remain a wife and mother, and always said she never noticed the difference between her age and her husband's. "He is my world," she said in 1960. "I've never seen or lived anything else."         She is survived by her children: Geraldine, the actress; Michael, Josephine, Victoria, Eugene, Jane, Annette-Emilie and James, and 17 grandchildren.         Correction:  October 1, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary on Saturday about Oona O'Neill Chaplin misstated her age in some copies. Mrs. Chaplin was 66 years old, not 70.       
         Grace Zaring Stone, a novelist who also wrote under the pen name Ethel Vance, died on Sunday at the Mary Elizabeth Nursing Center in Mystic, Conn. She was 100 years old and had lived in Stonington, Conn.         Three of Mrs. Stone's novels were made into films: "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," in 1933, which starred Barbara Stanwyck and Nils Asther; "Escape" (1940,) with Norma Shearer, Robert Taylor and Conrad Veidt, and "Winter Meeting" (1948,) with Bette Davis.         "The Bitter Tea of General Yen," about a New England woman who arrives in China to marry a missionary but becomes a captive of a Chinese warlord, was the first movie to be shown at Radio City Music Hall.         "Escape," an anti-Nazi thriller, was written in 1939 under the pseudonym Ethel Vance. In 1942 the author said the pen name had been used to protect her daughter, Eleanor Perenyi, who was living in occupied Europe, and because Mrs. Stone's husband, Ellis, was the United States naval attache in Paris, where they were living.         The book became a best seller, and Mrs. Stone used the Vance name for some of her later books, including "Reprisal" (1942) and "Winter Meeting," (1946).         Mrs. Stone was the great-great-granddaughter of Robert Owen, the British social reformer and socialist who founded the cooperative colony of New Harmony in Indiana. Her mother died when she was born, and she spent most of her childhood "visiting around," she said.         "In all the houses of the Owen descendants there were many books being very thoroughly read and almost everyone kept diaries," she said. "Diary keeping, writing in general, was just something one did. Then I married into the Navy and of course that was very, very different. But when my husband was stationed at St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands, the place seemed to get me started."         She wrote an account of a hurricane, and the Atlantic Monthly bought it, and later bought a short story as well. Then "Bobbs-Merrill wrote to ask me if I had a novel in mind, by any chance," Mrs. Stone said, "and of course that was a most amazing question to me, because I'd had a novel in mind practically forever."         Mrs. Stone's first novel was "The Heaven and Earth of Dona Elena," published in 1929. Her other works included "The Cold Journey" (1934,) "The Secret Thread" (1949) and "Althea" (1962).         Surviving besides her daughter, a writer, of Stonington, are a grandson and a great-graddaughter.       
         Aline MacMahon, an actress whose stage, screen, radio and television career lasted more than 50 years, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         She apparently died from pneumonia, friends said.         A veteran of 43 films, Miss MacMahon was nominated for an Academy Award as best supporting actress in "Dragon Seed" in 1944, appearing as the Chinese mother to the part played by Katharine Hepburn.         A Warner Brothers casting director in 1933 placed Miss MacMahon among the 10 smartest actresses, in a class with Miss Hepburn and Helen Hayes. Miss MacMahon's beauty inspired Cecil Beaton to photograph her and Isamu Noguchi to sculpture a marble bust. 'Beauty and Vitality and Truth'         Raves acclaimed her early role in Eugene O'Neill's "Beyond the Horizon," in 1926. Alexander Woollcott, the critic, said she acted "with extraordinary beauty and vitality and truth." The New Yorker said she "tempted one to rank her immediately as among the Olympians." Noel Coward called the newcomer "astonishing, moving and beautiful."         Rarely did she get a bad notice, even in productions that were otherwise panned. Walter Kerr wrote in The New York Times in 1967: "I have been seeing Aline MacMahon for more years than I'm going to be honest enough or ungentlemanly enough to count. Always she has pleased me, sometimes more, sometimes less, nevertheless always."         Offstage, she was equally busy. As chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater in 1950, she organized productions for community theaters. She was active in relief charities.         Miss MacMahon was born in McKeesport, Pa., and moved to Brooklyn with her family. Her father, the late William Marcus MacMahon, was the editor of Munsey's Magazine. At her urging, her mother, Jennie Simon MacMahon, began her own stage career at the age of 53. She died in 1984, three weeks before her 107th birthday.         Miss MacMahon graduated from Barnard College in 1920 and made her Broadway debut the next year in "The Mirage." Among her more memorable plays were "Pictures in the Hallway," "Once in a Lifetime," "The Eve of Saint Mark," "The Confidential Clerk" and "All the Way Home."         Her films included "Ah, Wilderness!," with Lionel Barrymore; "Gold Diggers of 1933"; "The Search," with Montgomery Clift; "The Eddie Cantor Story"; "The Lady Is Willing," with Marlene Dietrich; "The World Changes," with Paul Muni; "Five Star Final," with Edward G. Robinson; "One Way Passage," with William Powell; "Flame and Arrow," with Burt Lancaster; "I Live My Life," with Joan Crawford, and "Babbitt."         Her final role, in 1975 with Meryl Streep, was in "Trelawny of the Wells," the same play Ms. MacMahon performed at Barnard 55 years earlier.         She was married to Clarence S. Stein, the architect who helped to design Sunnyside Gardens in Queens and to plan Radburn, N.J. There are no survivors.       
         Emily M. Rosenthal, the director of the 92d Street Y nursery school from 1946 to 1966, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 years old.         Miss Rosenthal, who lived in the Salvation Army Williams Residence in Manhattan, died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Omus Hirshbein, vice chairman of the Tisch Center for the Arts at the 92d Street Y.M.H.A., said yesterday that Miss Rosenthal "was an extraordinary woman in the sense that she brought a cultured aspect of the Old World that is gone today, and passed that on to many generations of kids."         She was widely credited with doing much to shape and develop the school, which was founded in 1938.  Handicraft From Rubble         Miss Rosenthal, a German refugee, came to New York after teaching in England. At a Y nursery school celebration in 1981, Janet Fisher, one of its vice presidents, recalled that in England Miss Rosenthal had turned bomb shelters into nurseries, showing children how to make handicraft items from milk cartons and other materials found in the air-raid rubble.         "She did the same thing here at the Y with found objects," Mrs. Fisher recalled. "She made magic out of nothing."         Miss Rosenthal was born in the city of Krefeld in Germany, attended school in Bonn and graduated from a teacher training college in Frankfurt. She went on to teach at a girls' school in Krefeld and later became the director of a municipal kindergarten there.         In 1939, she fled Germany through the Netherlands to Britain, and in late 1940 she joined her mother and a brother in the United States. She held various teaching posts in New York before becoming director of the nursery school at the Y. After retiring from the school, she taught adult arts and crafts at the Y into the 1970's.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Veronica Perry, a Harlem teacher and the mother of Edmund Perry, the honor student fatally shot by a police officer on Morningside Drive on June 12, 1985, died on Oct. 4 at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 44 years old.         She died as a result of a heart condition, the funeral home said.         Mrs. Perry, a fifth-generation Harlem resident and a graduate of Bronx Community College and Fordham University, was a teacher for the Lenox Hill Association. She was a past president of Community School Board 3 and of the Parent-Teacher Association of Wadleigh Junior High School and was a member of the Sojourner Truth Democratic Club.         She is survived by her husband, Jonah Perry Sr.; her mother, Eva Rutledge; a son, Jonah Jr.; a daughter, Nicol, and several brothers and sisters.       
         Melissa Gold, who was active in various civic causes, including help for earthquake victims in San Francisco and was a companion of Bill Graham, the rock music impressario, died Friday in the helicopter crash near San Francisco that killed Mr. Graham and his pilot. She was 47 years old and lived in San Francisco.         Mrs. Gold was also a member of a prominent East Coast family. Her father, Joseph Richardson Dilworth, is a former chairman and chief executive officer of the Rockefeller Group in New York City.         Mrs. Gold was born in Washington and grew up in Princeton, N.J. She was a graduate of Radcliffe College and moved to San Francisco, where she married Herbert Gold, a writer. After a divorce, she married Robert L. Anderson, a lawyer, from who she was also divorced.         She and Mr. Graham were first acquainted about 12 years ago, her father said, and their friendship was renewed when they worked on the plans for the public welcoming of Nelson Mandela to San Francisco last year. They had recently been working on a project to provide money to improve public schools.         Besides her father, survivors include her mother, Elizabeth, of Princeton; a daughter, Nina Gold of New York City; twin sons, Ethan Gold, a student at Harvard University, and Ari Gold, a student at Columbia University; a sister, Alexandria (Lucy) Nolan of Silver City, N.M., and two brothers, Charles D. Dilworth of San Francisco and Joseph R. Dilworth Jr. of Bronxville, N.Y.       
         Nadine Gordimer, whose novels of South Africa portray the conflicts and contradictions of a racist society, was named winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature today as her country finally begins to dismantle the system her works have poignantly explored for more than 40 years.         In a brief citation, the Swedish Academy, which confers the awards, referred to her as "Nadine Gordimer, who through her magnificent epic writing has -- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- been of very great benefit to humanity."         The academy also added that "her continual involvement on behalf of literature and free speech in a police state where censorship and persecution of books and people exist have made her 'the doyenne of South African letters.' " Effects of Apartheid         In her stories and in such novels as "A Guest of Honour," "Burger's Daughter" and "My Son's Story," Miss Gordimer has written of the effects of apartheid on the relationships of men and women, parents and children.         The academy had reportedly passed over the 67-year-old Miss Gordimer several times. "I had been a possible candidate for so long that I had given up hope," she said today in New York City, where she was on a lecture tour to promote her new collection, "Jump and Other Stories."         She is the first woman to win the literature prize in 25 years, and one of only seven to win it in its 90-year history.         This year's Nobel awards, the rest of which will be announced here and in Oslo later this month, carry a stipend of about $985,000 each, the largest amount ever. Nobel's will established a sizable fund -- from his earnings as a chemical engineer and inventor of, among other things, dynamite -- for the winners: "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."         Prof. Sture Allen, one of the 18 members of the academy elected for life and also its permanent secretary, said that he had tried to call Miss Gordimer in Johannesburg on Wednesday night to give her the good news, but nobody at her home knew how to reach her.         The Swedish Academy, in a brief critique of her works issued with its citation, said today: "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment. At the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings."         In South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk extended his congratulations to Miss Gordimer for what he called "this exceptional achievement which is also an honor to South Africa." He stopped short of endorsing her uncompromising writing.         "As South African head of state, I am always pleased when one of my countrymen does well and achieves international recognition," Mr. de Klerk said in a deliberately neutral statement. "The Nobel Prize for literature is unequaled in prestige in the world. Winning it is a noteworthy achievement from any point of view."         The award to Miss Gordimer led the television news broadcast of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which devoted 80 seconds to her achievement, informing viewers that the same honor had been bestowed upon Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Pearl S. Buck.         Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, said he was "over the moon" about the award to Miss Gordimer: "She's an outstanding artist, has a way with words but more than anything else she has had this tremendous commitment and caring about people, caring about justice."         Miss Gordimer was born in 1923 in a small mining town near Johannesburg.  Both her parents were immigrant Jews -- her father from Lithuania, her mother from England. As a young writer, she has said, she was strongly influenced by "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel of social protest in America, which started her thinking about the plight of the miners in her own country.         Her first short story was published when she was only 15, and her first collection in 1949. Many stories appeared later in "The Soft Voice of the Serpent," a collection published in 1952; other notable groupings were "Friday's Footprints" in 1960, "Livingstone's Companions" in 1971, and "Something Out There," in 1984.  Ambiguity of a Title         The decisive part of her work, for the Swedish Academy, was her novels, particularly "July's People," published in 1981. The book describes a white family fleeing civil war with the help of their black servant, July, who takes them to his village. "The ambiguity of the novel's title quickly etches itself -- July's people are the white family he still serves but also the members of his tribe," the academy's literary critique said.         The announcement of the award to Miss Gordimer -- made at precisely 1 P.M., in keeping with tradition -- was met with cheers. Not since 1966, when Nelly Sachs shared the award with Shmuel Yosef Agnon of Israel, has a woman won the literature prize.         Professor Allen said the disagreements within the academy that had prevented the prize from going to Miss Gordimer before this would remain a secret for 50 years, like most other details of the prize committee's deliberations. But he volunteered that he had long been an admirer of her work.         He insisted that the award had nothing to do with the politics of apartheid, or with the fact that it was only this year that South Africa's leaders had finally begun to dismantle the system.         "The Nobel Peace Prize is a political award," Professor Allen said, "and it will be announced in Oslo. This is a literary award. That is her own argument; she is very keen on that point. Her works have a political basis, but her writing is different." Will Help Black Writers         Miss Gordimer, who is a member of the African National Congress, which had long been outlawed, said today that she wanted to use some of the prize money to help the predominantly black Congress of South African Writers.  "I'm a founder of the Congress of South African writers," she said at a news conference in New York, "and all my colleagues are black. Most of the black authors write in English, and I hope that they will begin to express themselves in their African languages."         The South African Government banned "A World of Strangers," published in 1958 and describing the difficulties experienced by a Briton establishing friendships with black South Africans in segregated Johannesburg. More than 20 years later, it banned "Burger's Daughter," a novel described by the academy today as one of her masterpieces, along with "The Conservationist" and "July's People."         "A Guest of Honor," published in 1970 and another novel cited by the academy today, described the conflict of loyalties experienced by a former colonial administrator returning to a newly independent African country that had expelled him for his ties to black groups.         "My Son's Story," published in 1990, describes "love in an insupportable society, the complications and obstacles inherent in the path to change," the academy said.         "The novel is ingenious and revealing, and at the same time enthralling because of its poetic values," the academy said. "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her outstanding literary style characterize her short stories as well."         All of her 10 novels and 9 short-story collections are now permitted to be published in South Africa.         Despite her fight against apartheid, Miss Gordimer, who has been married since 1954 to a Johannesburg gallery owner, Reinhold Cassirer, has always considered herself a South African. She said that she had only once considered emigrating, to Zambia. "Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European, a stranger," she told Reuters in an interview this year.         The Nobel awards for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. He established the first five categories in his will; economics was added in 1968, with an endowment from the Bank of Sweden.       
         Natalia Ginzburg, an author commonly ranked with Umberto Eco as one of Italy's most important writers of fiction, died on Monday at her home in Rome. She was 75 years old.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for her publisher, Einaudi, said yesterday.         Although once dismissed as a minor writer because of her preoccupation with family life, Miss Ginzburg had seen her six works of fiction, a play ("I Married You for the Fun of It"), essays, a biography of the 19th-century novelist Alessandro Manzoni and translations of Flaubert and Proust recognized in recent years as the creations of a major artist.         Miss Ginzburg was born in Palermo, Sicily. Her mother was Catholic; her father, a professor of anatomy, Jewish. Her formative years were spent in Turin. There, she met and married Leone Ginzburg, a teacher of Russian and a leader of the anti-fascist intellectuals who in the late 1930's formed the core group of the Einaudi publishing house.         From 1940 to 1943, the Ginzburgs were confined to a small village east of Rome because of their Jewish heritage. It was during this time that Natalia Ginzburg published her first book, "The Road to the City," using the pseudonym Alessandra Torninparte in order to circumvent laws restricting the activities of Jews. 'I Got to Know Grief'         In 1943, her husband was arrested and imprisoned for anti-fascist activities. His death in prison a few months later was never explained by the authorities. "I got to know grief very well -- a real, irremedial and incurable grief that shattered my life," she recalled in an essay written in 1986, "and when I tried to put it together again I realized that my life had become irreconcilable with what had gone before. Only my vocation remained unchanged. At first I hated it, it disgusted me, but I knew very well that I would end up returning to it, and that it would save me."         After the war, Miss Ginzburg returned to Einaudi as an editor and continued to write. She won several Italian literary prizes and gained international recognition with the publication of "Voices in the Evening," a novel (1961), and an autobiography, "Family Sayings" (1963).         In "Family Sayings," she mingled her family story -- dominated by her impatient scientist father and ever-cheerful mother -- with the events of Italian history in the period between the two world wars. In a preface to the book, Miss Ginzburg wrote: "Possibly some people may not be pleased to find themselves described in the book under their own names. To such I have nothing to say."         Her biography of Manzoni, which Mary McCarthy called an "original and engrossing work," stood the old-style heroic genre on its head. While admiring Manzoni's literary achievements, her study also lays bare Manzoni's shocking indifference to his children.  Taking Sides in an Adoption         Miss Ginzburg's last book created an uproar. "Serena Cruz, or True Justice" recounts an explosive adoption case that divided Italy in 1989. In the dispute, a Filipino girl was taken from her adoptive Italian parents on grounds that the adoption was illegal. Miss Ginzburg strongly sided with the adoptive parents, arguing that their nurturing the child for 14 months should have entitled them to keep her.         In a profile of Miss Ginzburg in The New York Times Magazine in 1990, the American writer Mary Gordon recalled having asked her to account for the quality of understatement that characterizes her work.         "I was the little sister," Miss Ginzburg replied. "When you are the youngest in the family, people are always telling you to hurry up, to get to the point, say what you mean. I think that's why I write the way I do."         Asked what kind of writer she would have become had her life not been disrupted by the war, she told Ms. Gordon: "Of course I wrote about the war. I was formed by the war because that was what happened to me. I think of a writer as a river: you reflect what passes before you. The trees pass, and the houses; you reflect what is there."         "I write about families," she continued, "because that is where everything starts, where the germs grow." Likened to Chekhov         The subtlety and economy of Miss Ginzburg's style has prompted critics to liken her to Chekhov. "When I write something I usually think it is very important and that I am a very fine writer," she wrote in an essay for The New York Times Book Review in 1986. "But there is one corner of my mind in which I know very well what I am, which is a small, a very small writer."         In 1983, Miss Ginzburg was elected to the Italian Parliament as a representative of a left-wing party unaffiliated with the Communists. She served only one term. "I did it because I like to learn about things," she told Ms. Gordon. "I like to learn about them so that I can write about them."         In 1950, she married Gabriele Baldini, a professor of English literature at the University of Rome. He died in 1969. She is survived by her four children, Alessandra, Carlo, Leone and Susanna. Funeral services are to be held tomorrow.       
         Aline Laveen MacMahon, an actress whose career on the stage, screen, radio and television lasted more than 50 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.

         Minna Citron, a painter and printmaker best known for her Social Realist images of New York City, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 95 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died after a long illness, said her granddaughter Christiane Citron of Denver.         Mrs. Citron, whose maiden name was Wright, was born in Newark on Oct. 15, 1896, and grew up in Brooklyn. She began to study art as a diversion in the 1920's when she was living in Brooklyn, married and the mother of two sons. By 1928, she was studying at the Art Students League with John Sloan and Kenneth Hayes Miller, whose satirical depictions of city life influenced her own style. She had her first solo exhibition in 1930 at the New School for Social Research.         By 1934, she was divorced and working in a studio on Union Square. She soon became associated with a loosely knit group of Realist painters known as the 14th Street school, who included Moses and Raphael Soyer and Isabel Bishop. In the late 1930's she taught art and painted murals for the Works Progress Administration. In the early 1940's, she changed to abstraction, which remained her primary style for the rest of her life.         Mrs. Citron had many exhibitions, both in the United States and abroad; her most recent show in New York City was held last year at the Susan Teller Gallery in SoHo. Her work is represented in many museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York City, and the National Museum of American Art and the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.         She is survived by her sons, Casper, of Manhattan a radio and television commentator, and Tom, of Short Hills., N.J.; seven grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Harriet Feldman, a former school board president in Roslyn, L.I., died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 56 years old and lived in Roslyn.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Feldman taught schools in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and in Massapequa Park, L.I. She was president of the Parent-Teacher Association at six Roslyn schools.         For the last six years, she was an elected member of the Board of Education. She served as vice president and later president.         She is survived by her husband, Herbert; two sons, David, of Bayside, Queens, and Peter, of Roslyn; two daughters, Karen and Jennifer, of Roslyn; her mother, Miriam Glickman of West Lawrence, L.I.; a sister, Theda Wells of Woodmere, L.I., and two granddaughters.
