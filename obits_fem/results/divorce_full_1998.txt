         Dorothy Hart Hirshon, a glamorous figure in New York society from the 1920's through the 40's who later became active in social, human rights and political causes, died Thursday in an automobile accident while driving near her home in Glen Cove, on Long Island. She was 89.         Frequently photographed and written about during her glittering earlier marriages to John Randolph Hearst and William S. Paley, she married Walter Hirshon, a stockbroker, in 1953. After their divorce in 1961, she became increasingly involved in education and philanthropic endeavors.         Described as ''one of the most beautiful girls in Southern California'' by Irene Selznick, Dorothy Hart was 19 when she met her first husband, Mr. Hearst, the third of William Randolph Hearst's five sons, while sailing on a yacht off Santa Barbara.         Mr. Hearst had not yet entered his first year at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, but the couple were married in New York in December 1927.         The groom dropped out of college after his freshman year and joined the Hearst Corporation, and the young marrieds became regulars in the glamorous cafe society of the period, out on the town almost every night.         Mr. Hearst, who had difficulty working with his powerful father, began drinking heavily. Mrs. Hearst, hoping to set an example for her husband, who rarely showed up for work, took a job writing a column for Harper's Bazaar.         Mrs. Hearst met Mr. Paley, the dashing head of the Columbia Broadcasting System, in 1931. According to friends, it was immediately obvious that he was determined to marry her.         After some months, she went to Nevada and filed for a divorce. Mr. Hearst followed her; the couple reconciled and returned to New York. Five months later, Mrs. Hearst again traveled to Las Vegas and was granted a divorce. In May 1932, she married Mr. Paley in Kingman, Ariz.         ''Although seven years his junior, Dorothy was more worldly than he,'' Sally Bedell Smith wrote in ''In All His Glory,'' her 1990 biography of Mr. Paley. ''She knew her way around in sophisticated circles; friendships with men like Randolph Churchill counted a great deal to the ambitious Paley. In New York, she joined the Algonquin set -- the playwrights, journalists and other intellectuals whose luncheon ripostes during the 1920's became a literary legend.''         Over the years, Mrs. Smith wrote, Mr. Paley's wife had an impact on him -- ''her political leanings, appetite for news, taste in art and sense of style. She supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and embraced his proposals for social welfare.''         David Patrick Columbia wrote in Quest magazine in 1993: ''They were the golden couple on the town. She became his Pygmalion. His hunger to know satisfied her trenchant desire to teach. He had the instincts, but she, despite her youth, had the instincts and the knowledge. She began transforming his life. She got him to Savile Row tailors. She encouraged him to buy art and introduced him to dealers. In a short time they began to accumulate what is now known as the William Paley Collection. At her suggestion, they pursued the thoroughly modern path of psychoanalysis.''         She was sketched by Matisse, photographed by Cecil Beaton and Horst, listed as one of the world's best-dressed women and featured in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. She decorated Kiluna Farm, their 85-acre estate in Manhasset, with a saltwater pool and an indoor tennis court, lining the walls with their growing collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. Twenty-two servants looked after the house, gardens and greenhouse.         The Paleys separated in 1945, shortly after Mr. Paley returned from wartime service in London. Mrs. Smith observed in her book that Mr. Paley's ''peccadillos weren't the only symptom of trouble ahead.''         ''To those with a sharp eye, other hairline cracks were showing in the marriage,'' Mrs. Smith wrote. ''When Dorothy corrected him in public, she was brisk and impatient, not gentle.''         They were divorced in 1947, and she received some paintings, furniture, silver and $1.5 million.         ''I never behaved as if the world revolved around him,'' Mrs. Hirshon once recalled about her marriage to Mr. Paley. ''Maybe that was a problem.''         Dorothy Hart was born in Los Angeles on Feb. 25, 1908, the only child of Seth Hart, an insurance broker, and the former Dorothy Jones. While she was in elementary school, the family moved to Dayton, Ohio, for three years. Upon their return to Los Angeles, she attended Marlboro, an exclusive girls' school. She later spent a year at Bennett Junior College in Millbrook, N.Y., and furthered her lifelong interest in art by taking several art history courses.         Although she participated in a number of social projects throughout her life, raising money to build a nursery school in Harlem, for instance, and serving as a guidance counselor at the Downtown Community School in the 1940's, she became more involved in philanthropic and community activities in the last 40 years.         She worked with the Neighborhood Children's Center for more than two decades, was a member of the New York City Human Rights Commission, served on the Hospitality Committee of the United Nations in the 1960's, and became a board member of the Vivian Beaumont Theater, a board member of Lincoln Center in the 1980's and a trustee of Carnegie Hall. She was also on the board of Phoenix House and was a trustee of the New School for Social Research until her death.         She is survived by a son, Jeffrey Paley of Manhattan; a daughter, Hilary Paley Califano of Roxbury, Conn., and Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Joy H. Briggs of Manhattan, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Martha Ellis Gellhorn, who as one of the first female war correspondents covered a dozen major conflicts in a writing career spanning more than six decades, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 89.         Ms. Gellhorn was a cocky, raspy-voiced maverick who saw herself as a champion of ordinary people trapped in conflicts created by the rich and powerful. That she was  known to many largely because of  her marriage to Ernest Hemingway, from 1940 to 1945, caused her unending irritation, especially when critics tried to find parallels between her lean writing style and that of her more celebrated husband.         ''Why should I be a footnote to somebody else's life?'' she bitterly asked in an interview, pointing out that she had written two novels before meeting Hemingway and continued writing for almost a half-century after leaving him.         As a journalist, Ms. Gellhorn had no use for the notion of objectivity. The chief point of going to cover anything, she felt, was so you could tell what you saw, contradict the lies and let the bad guys have it.         ''You go into a hospital, and it's full of wounded kids,'' she once said. ''So you write what you see and how it is. You don't say there's 37 wounded children in this hospital, but maybe there's 38 wounded children on the other side. You write what you see.''         Though best known for her groundbreaking journalism, Ms. Gellhorn was also an accomplished fiction writer, author of 5 novels, 14 novellas and 2 collections of short stories, many of which were based on people and incidents she encountered during her prodigious travels.         Fresh out of Bryn Mawr College in 1927, she began writing for The New Republic, then became a crime reporter for a local newspaper in Albany. Ms. Gellhorn got to Europe by writing a brochure for the Holland American Line and traveled throughout the continent. Later, she met Harry Hopkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's confidant, and talked her way into a job with the New Deal, wandering America and writing about the effects of the Depression on ordinary people.         She went to Spain in 1937 with nothing but a knapsack and $50, covered the conflict for Collier's Weekly and became Hemingway's lover.         ''In Barcelona, it was perfect bombing weather,'' she wrote in a typical dispatch in 1938. ''The cafes along the Ramblas were crowded. There was nothing much to drink; a sweet fizzy poison called orangeade and a horrible liquid supposed to be sherry. There was, of course, nothing to eat. Everyone was out enjoying the cold afternoon sunlight. No bombers had come over for at least two hours.''         She covered the blitz in London. On D-Day, she stowed away on a hospital ship and snuck ashore as a stretcher bearer. She got British pilots to let her ride along on night bombing raids over Germany. When the Allies liberated Dachau, she was there to write about it.         ''Behind the barbed wire and the electric fence,'' she wrote of her visit to Dachau, ''the skeletons sat in the sun and searched themselves for lice. They have no age and no faces; they all look alike and like nothing you will ever see if you are lucky.''         She covered Russia's war against Finland in 1939, trekked across China with Hemingway in 1940, and became increasingly critical of the United States, which she saw as a ''colonial power,'' eventually settling abroad for good. She covered Vietnam, Nicaraguan contras, the Arab-Israeli conflict and, at the age of 81, the United States invasion of Panama. It was only when war came to Bosnia that she gave it a pass.         ''Too old,'' she said. ''You have to be nimble for war.''         Ms. Gellhorn's war correspondence was collected in ''The Face of War'' in 1959. She always focused on ordinary foot soldiers and civilians, ignoring the generals. Her peacetime journalism was collected in ''The View From the Ground'' in 1988.         Among her novels were ''A Stricken Field'' (1940), set among refugees in Prague just before the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, and ''Liana'' (1944), about the marriage of a mulatto woman and a rich white man in the French Caribbean.         Many reviewers felt Ms. Gellhorn was even more successful as a writer of novellas, and she was highly praised for ''The Weather in Africa'' (1988), three novellas set on that continent, and ''The Novellas of Martha Gellhorn'' (1993).         Ms. Gellhorn sometimes took criticism from political conservatives, who painted her as a left-leaning dilettante whose writing was often didactic and sentimental. Others  criticized her vivid journalism as being, stylistically, too much like fiction and her terse fiction as being, stylistically, too much like journalism.         But her longevity and the compelling pull of her life story overrode such criticisms. A heroine to generations of young women correspondents for her fight to get equal treatment and a place on the front lines with male colleagues, she was also a romantic figure for her wartime relationship with one of the century's most famous writers and her subsequent rejection of him.         Ms. Gellhorn's father was a doctor in St. Louis with progressive notions and her mother, whom she adored, was a suffragist and social reformer who sometimes took her daughter  with her to rallies and protests.         Her father pulled her out of a convent school when he discovered the nuns were teaching female anatomy with a textbook that had its pictures covered and transferred the girl to a progressive coeducational school of which her mother was a co-founder.  Later, at Bryn Mawr, Ms. Gellhorn changed her major from English to French, which became useful for her  journalistic work in Europe. In 1934, she was among a group of American students invited to tour Nazi Germany, and she never forgot her first encounter with Fascism. When she returned to the United States and was working for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, she befriended Eleanor Roosevelt and spent some time, as the First Lady's guest, at the White House. She also wrote a collection of novellas about it, ''The Trouble I've Seen'' (1936).         Her first marriage, in 1933 to Bertrand de Jouvenel, a French pacifist who was the son-in-law of the novelist Colette, ended in divorce.         In 1936, she wandered into a bar in Key West, Fla., and met Hemingway. They drank, became friends and, the next year, when she showed up in Madrid, she picked up again with Hemingway and other war correspondents. She married the author in 1940, becoming his third wife.         They traveled and worked together, living between conflicts at a villa in Cuba. In 1945, Ms. Gellhorn left Hemingway, walking out after an argument at London's Dorchester Hotel. She was the only one of Hemingway's wives to leave him, and he never forgave her. ''His hatred of her was a terrible thing to see,'' one Hemingway biographer noted. She left, she said, because he was jealous and bullying.         Ms. Gellhorn's third marriage, to T. S. Matthews, an editor at Time magazine, also ended in divorce. She said she just found married life too boring.         After World War II, Ms. Gellhorn adopted a son in Italy and raised him, largely on her own, in Mexico and other countries, where she supported herself with a string of articles for women's magazines.         She is survived by her son, George Alexander Gellhorn of London, and a brother, Alfred Gellhorn of New York.         Ms. Gellhorn had decided that she could no longer live in the United States, and moved from Cuba to Italy to Mexico to Kenya until finally settling in Britain, where she spent her  last 15 years shuttling between a small cottage in Wales, an apartment in London and the world's trouble spots. Her South Kensington apartment became a kind of salon for writers and foreign correspondents.         Bill Buford, the fiction editor at The New Yorker who was previously the editor of Granta, an English literary magazine, wrote about Ms. Gellhorn and her work: ''Reading Martha Gellhorn for the first time is a staggering experience. She is not a travel writer or a journalist or a novelist. She is all of these, and one of the most eloquent witnesses of the 20th century.''         She also wrote a highly regarded travel book in 1979, ''Travels With Myself and Another,'' that was an often humorous recounting of some of her more uncomfortable jaunts to remote corners of the globe, some  with Hemingway, whom she referred to only as Unwilling Companion.         Her first love continued to be a crusading brand of nonfiction. ''Journalism is education for me,'' she wrote. ''Writing is payment for the chance to look and learn.''         She wrote on an old, battered typewriter and had to quit in 1992 when a cataract operation left her with diminished eyesight. She could no longer see the keys and felt she was too old to learn how to dictate.         But she never lost her bite. She chain-smoked, drank and ate what she pleased. ''It bores me, all that health stuff,'' she said. She told one woman who came to interview her late in life that she had to stop. ''This conversation is so boring I think I'm going to faint,'' she said.         Ms. Gellhorn had little use for most war reporting after the Vietnam War, saying that the press' role in ending that conflict had taught military leaders a lesson.         ''They realized the power of the press and have been controlling it ever since,'' she said. ''Look at the Gulf War. If you wanted to go out and say to a soldier, 'How is it, kid?,' you had to bring a minder so the kid says nothing.         ''It seems to me that they feed war reporters at these ridiculous briefings in the ballroom of hotels miles from anywhere.'' The public, she said, needs to realize that it is not getting the full story.         Looking back on a life that was colorful enough for any novel or reportage, Ms. Gellhorn once confessed: ''I'm overprivileged. I've had a wonderful life. I didn't deserve it but I've had it.''       
         Dr. Mary Catherine Raugust Howell, a pediatrician who championed medical careers and better health care for women and who was the first woman to become an associate dean at Harvard Medical School, died yesterday at her home in Watertown, Mass. She was 65.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Dr. Howell attracted the attention of a male-dominated establishment in 1973 with an ironically titled critique of the status quo, ''Why Would a Girl Go into Medicine? Medical Education in the United States: A Guide for Women'' (Feminist Press). Since Dr. Howell was a Harvard associate dean at the time, she decided to publish it under the pen name Margaret A. Campbell.         Her study of discrimination against women in medical schools, she declared in her foreword, was written ''to inform and encourage women medical students of the past, present and future and to promote radical change in medical education and in the care of patients.''         While quotas were not acknowledged in the admissions offices of medical schools, she wrote, practice suggested otherwise. A ''man doctor, woman nurse'' mentality reigned, she said, and with it the attitude that it was imprudent to waste expensive medical school training on a woman if she was unlikely to practice the profession because of marriage and  motherhood.         Dr. Howell acknowledged authorship of the book a few years later.  Her facts and figures were used as  ammunition by many groups pressing to gain a fairer role for women in the medical field. The prospects of women in medicine were eventually enhanced by Federal legislation against sex discrimination.         Dr. Howell was also active in the women's health movement. She was  a founding member of the National Women's Health Network, which was formed in the 1970's to lobby for better health care for women.         ''By 1975,'' said Cynthia Pearson, the network's executive director, ''there were over 2,000 community-based women's health groups that either provided direct services and education and an alternative to traditional male-dominated medical care or were engaged in efforts to change the system. Mary helped organize the first national women's health conference, which brought individual women and representatives of grass-roots women's health groups to the Harvard campus.''         Dr. Howell also contributed to Working Mother magazine and to ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' from the Boston Women's Book Collective, whose 25th anniversary update was published by Touchstone in 1996.         Mary Catherine Raugust was born on Sept. 2, 1932, in Grand Forks, N. D., the daughter of a businessman and a former public-school teacher. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1954, studied linguistics and originally wanted to become a musician. She married Robert Jordan of Weston, Conn., and had a son, Nicholas, but the marriage failed. She then decided to become a pediatrician.         ''She started to think she wanted to care for kids and went into pre-med,'' said Samuel Howell, her son by a second marriage. ''She was always very concerned about children and the institutional way in which medicine treats them. She fought against that all her life, trying to de-institutionalize medicine.''         In interviews later in her life, Dr. Howell told of the slights, condescension, jokes and outright hostility she endured as a medical student and intern from school administrators, faculty members and male students. Even female patients often feared that a female doctor was inherently inferior, Dr. Howell said.         But, persisting, she earned a Ph.D. in developmental psychology and an M.D. at the University of Minnesota in 1962; she earned a doctor of laws degree at Harvard University in 1991.         Dr. Howell trained in pediatrics, psychotherapy, bioethics and geriatrics at various institutions as she pursued her career as a practicing doctor and educator, starting as an instructor in child development at Minnesota in 1962. She joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School as an instructor in pediatrics in 1969, rising to become an assistant professor of pediatrics and chief of the behavior unit in the Children's Service of the Massachusetts General Hospital.         Dr. Howell was appointed associate dean for student affairs in 1972, becoming the highest-ranking woman at the medical school at the time, and served until 1975. She viewed her appointment as a kind of tokenism.         ''Prior to my appointment,'' she said in an interview in 1979, ''a committee of students and faculty had asserted the need for a woman administrator, and Harvard got tremendous mileage out of my appointment. Student affairs are traditionally places where your job is to keep students quiet and out of everyone's hair. The administration expected us to act as student pacifiers rather than student advocates.''         Shortly after her appointment, Dr. Howell sent out questionnaires to female medical students throughout  the country, asking them about their status and attitudes toward them. Their responses reminded her of her own painful journey to become a doctor, she said, and she decided to use them as the basis for what became her book for Feminist Press.         After leaving Harvard in 1975, she had a pediatric practice in York, Me.,  for a year. Based on her experiences there, she wrote another book, ''Healing at Home: A Guide to Health Care for Children'' (Beacon Press, 1978) She returned to the Boston area to practice pediatrics and psychotherapy.         From 1992 to 1994, she was a member of the Division of Medical Ethics at Harvard Medical School.         Dr. Howell's second marriage, to Dr. A. Ervin Howell of Fairmont, Minn., ended in divorce.         In addition to her sons Nicholas Jordan, of Weston, Conn., and Samuel Howell, of Manhattan, she is survived by three other sons, Aaron Howell, of Medford, Mass., Eli Howell, of Eugene, Ore., and Ned Raugust, of Concord, Mass.; two daughters, Sarah Howell, of Framingham, Mass., and Eve Howell, of Boston; a brother, Tony Raugust of Minneapolis, and one granddaughter.       
         Jean Blackwell Hutson, who as curator and then chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture helped make it the world's main public repository of materials on people of African descent, died on  Wednesday at Harlem Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Harlem.         From 1948, when the Schomburg Center was known as the Schomburg Collection, until 1980, when she retired as its chief, Mrs. Hutson harnessed her powerful will to assemble an archive of documents, books and works of art that reflected the experience not just of African-Americans, but of peoples throughout the African diaspora.         Under her supervision, the library grew to 75,000 volumes from 15,000 volumes. She assembled an important collection of historical material from Haiti, as well as of African art, and persuaded her childhood friend, Langston Hughes, to donate a portion of his papers to the center. A friend of Romare Bearden, Dorothy West, Richard Wright, W. E. B. DuBois and other figures of the Harlem Renaissance, Mrs. Hutson helped make the Schomburg the cultural center of Harlem.         Even when people, both black and white, during the integrationist movement of the 1940's and early 50's, questioned the need for a separate archive devoted entirely to black experience, Mrs. Hutson championed it. And in the years when the Schomburg's budget was faltering, she fought for financing, and lobbied the State Legislature for money.         ''She had an exacting personality,'' said Howard Dodson, the present chief of the Schomburg. ''She ran a tight ship and had an astute way of getting what she wanted done.  Once her mind was set on doing something, there was no stopping her.''         She was born in 1914 in Sommerfield, Fla., where her father, Paul O. Blackwell, was in business as a  farmer. Her mother, Sarah Myers  Blackwell, was an elementary school teacher. When she was 4, she and her mother moved to Baltimore while her father remained in Florida to run his business, commuting back and forth to Baltimore to visit his family.         Through her baby sitter, who ran a boarding house, she met the poet Langston Hughes. Hughes was then a student at Lincoln University in Oxford, Pa., and went to Baltimore on weekends. Their friendship endured. Throughout his life he referred to her as his ''baby sister,'' and when Mrs. Hutson came to Harlem as a young woman, Hughes made sure she met the leading writers and artists.         At 15, Mrs. Hutson was class valedictorian at her graduation from Douglass High School in Baltimore, then an all-black high school in a segregated system. The school had exacting standards and emphasized the study of black history and literature. One of her teachers was Yolande Du Bois, the daughter of W. E. B. DuBois.         She attended the University of Michigan, then switched to Barnard College. In 1935, she became the second black woman to graduate from Barnard; the first was Zora Neale Hurston.         Mrs. Hutson wanted to be a psychiatrist but took up library science with the goal of financing medical studies. In 1936 she received a master's degree from the Columbia University School of Library Service.         Her first job was in the New York City Public Branch Library system. As a librarian in the Bronx, Mrs. Hutson noticed that there were few Spanish-language books that would appeal to the borough's Spanish population, and she arranged to buy some. In 1939, she married Andy Razaf, a lyricist who wrote songs for Fats Waller. The marriage ended in divorce eight years later.         In 1950 she married John Hutson, a fellow employee at the Countee Cullen branch library. Mr. Hutson died in 1957. They had one daughter, Jean Frances, who died in 1992. Mrs. Hutson left no survivors.         In 1948, Mrs. Hutson was asked to take over the Schomburg, which was based on the private library of Arthur Alphonzo Schomburg, a Puerto Rican of African descent. ''I was drafted for six months to keep the Negroes quiet,'' Mrs. Hutson once said. ''People who grew up in the Depression didn't throw away jobs, so I came.''         With the rise of the black power movement and the success of independence movements in Africa and the Caribbean, interest in the Schomburg grew. In 1962, under her supervision, the library published the Dictionary Catalogue of the Schomburg Collection, which was put on microfilm and made its holdings known to libraries in Europe, Africa and the Americas.         Mrs. Hutson's work in developing the Schomburg caught the attention of President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, who asked her help in building an Africana collection at the University of Ghana. She lived in Ghana in 1964.         During the 1960's and 70's, the situation at the Schomburg grew perilous, with its collections deteriorating in the Countee Cullen branch library, a sparsely furnished, poorly lighted  space without air-conditioning at 103 West 135th Street. In 1971, Mrs. Hutson helped establish the Schomburg Corporation to raise money for a new building.         She ''learned to go to Albany,'' as she said once in an interview. There were many politicians, Mrs. Hutson said, ''who had never seen a black woman up in front of them at the legislature.'' Eventually she helped obtain a Federal grant for the construction of a new building.         In 1981, the new $3.7 million center finally opened, five stories tall, built of red brick and glass, climate-controlled, with an art gallery. By then, Mrs. Hutson had retired as the Schomburg's chief, and had taken a job in the office of library administration at the Public Library's headquarters on 42d Street.         Today, the Schomburg Collection holds some 150,000 volumes, 3.5 million manuscripts, the largest assemblage of photographs in the world documenting black life, and precious artifacts including a 16th-century manuscript, ''Ad Catholicum,'' by Juan Latino, believed to be the first book written by a black man.       
         Irene Kampen, who saw her sometimes strife-torn life as such a sitcom that it took Lucille Ball to portray it on television, died on Monday in Oceanside, Calif. She was 75 and the author of the book that inspired ''The Lucy Show.''         Her family said the cause was breast cancer.         Mrs. Kampen may not have been a born humorist, but she got a good start. Her father, Jack Trepel, a Rockefeller Center florist, was an accomplished magician with the gift of patter, and to hear Mrs. Kampen tell it, her mother, Mary, always had something funny to say and never held her tongue.         By the time she got to the University of Wisconsin, Mrs. Kampen, who was born in Brooklyn and later lived in Great Neck, N.Y., was funny enough to become editor of the campus humor magazine.         After graduating in 1943 with a degree in journalism, she worked as a copy girl at the old New York Journal-American. A child of her era, she wanted to be a conventional housewife and mother, and for a while she got her wish.         After her marriage to Owen Kampen, an artist and illustrator whom she had met in college, the couple settled in Levittown, on Long Island, where Mrs. Kampen kept house, took care of her young daughter, and, in a concession to her training, contributed society columns to the weekly Levittown Tribune.         In 1954, to be closer to Mrs. Kampen's parents, the couple built a house in Ridgefield, Conn., and might have settled into an idyllic New England life if Mr. Kampen hadn't had an affair with the architect's wife.  The resulting divorce was as bitter as any, but Mrs. Kampen came through it with a sure-fire sense of the absurd.         It wasn't easy being a divorced mother in a tiny New England town in the 1950's. Mrs. Kampen took in another struggling divorced mother to help make ends meet.         But for all the economic hardship and social stigma, she not only made the best of it; she also took notes.  And when she turned them into a book, ''Life Without George,'' in 1961, she had a new career.         Her timing was close to perfect. The book came out just as Lucille Ball, whose divorce from Desi Arnaz had undercut the premise of her famous ''I Love Lucy'' television series, was casting around for a new format as a working mother. ''Life Without George'' fit the bill.         The success of the book and of the television series, which ran from 1962 to 1968, helped persuade Mrs. Kampen to continue mining her life for comedy. Although she had barely mentioned her husband in ''Life Without George,'' she tried her hand at serious, cathartic fiction with ''We That Are Left,'' a thinly disguised 1961 account of her marriage.         For the 1965 ''Europe Without George,'' she returned to humor with a vengeance.         Taking no chances during a summer research vacation, she ordered her college-age daughter to go out and have fun and adventures in every city they visited.         Her daughter chafed a bit, but provided enough good subject matter that for a while she became a virtual subsidiary of the family enterprise. When she and her boyfriend wanted to go skiing, for example, her mother insisted on going along, not simply as a chaperone but because she wanted to take notes. Mrs. Kampen recounted the adventure in ''Last Year at Sugarbush'' (1965).         Similarly, her daughter's wedding became ''Here Comes the Bride, There Goes the Mother'' (1967), and while Mrs. Kampen did not accompany the couple on their honeymoon, she was right there when they went to graduate school at the University of Wisconsin, turning out ''Due to Lack of Interest, Tomorrow Has Been Canceled,'' the story of a 45-year-old divorced woman who returns to college in the hippie era.         Mrs. Kampen, whose other books include ''Are You Carrying Any Gold or Living Relatives?,'' a 1970 account of a trip to the Soviet Union, also wrote widely for magazines, turned out self-deprecating columns about her life for local newspapers and talked her way repeatedly around the world as a cruise-ship lecturer.         As she got older, the travails of aging provided a fount of material.         In addition to her daughter, Christine Gutherie of San Francisco, Mrs. Kampen is survived by her companion, Louis Ferioli, and a sister, Joyce Miller of Washington.       
         Lily Harmon, an artist who worked in portraiture, assemblage and book illustration, and whose third husband was the collector Joseph H. Hirshhorn, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Ms. Harmon, whose original name  was Lily Perlmutter, was born in 1912 in New Haven. She studied art at the Yale School of Fine Arts in New Haven, then at the Academie Colarossi in Paris and the Art Students' League in New York. By the early 1930's she was working in a Social Realist style that with adjustments would be the mainstay of her work.         Ms. Harmon's art could lean toward social satire similar to Philip Evergood's, or scenes of poetic introspection, like some of Philip Guston's early works. But it usually followed a tradition of sympathetic portraiture personified by Raphael Soyer, becoming increasingly refined in the 1970's. Her subjects tended to be relatives or art-world friends: her grandmother; the painter Helen Frankenthaler; Mimi Gross, the daughter of the sculptor Chaim Gross; and the mother of her first husband, Philip Graham Harden, shown in a work from 1931 titled ''My Nude Mother-in-Law.''         Ms. Harmon had her first solo exhibition at the Associated American Artists Gallery in New York in 1944. She met the millionaire Joseph Hirshhorn, one of the most active art collectors of his generation, in the early 40's when he visited her studio to see her paintings. They were married in 1945 and adopted two infant daughters, in 1946 and 1950. The marriage ended in divorce in 1956.         Ms. Harmon exhibited regularly in surveys of contemporary American art in museums across the country, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington and the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh.         In 1982, a 50-year retrospective organized by the Wichita Art Museum in Kansas traveled to the Provincetown Art Association in Massachusetts and the Butler Institute of American Art in Youngstown, Ohio. In December, the Butler Institute mounted a second show, devoted to the found-object assemblages and collages that Ms. Harmon made intermittently in the 1960's and 70's, which will close on March 1.         Ms. Harmon is represented in public collections, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney Museum and the Jewish Museum in New York City, and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington.         From 1945 to 1976, Ms. Harmon illustrated books, most notably works by Andre Gide, Jean-Paul Sartre, Thomas Mann, Edith Wharton and Franz Kafka. ''Freehand,'' her autobiography, was published in 1981 (Simon & Schuster).         Ms. Harmon was married three other times. From 1934 to 1940, she was married to Sidney Harmon, a film and theatrical producer. In 1960 she was married briefly to Henry Rothman, a framemaker. In 1972 she married Milton Schachter, a real estate developer, who died in 1996.         She is survived by her daughters, Amy Hirshhorn, of Watertown, Mass., and Jo Ann Hirshhorn, of New Orleans, and two grandchildren.       
         Esther Bubley, a documentary photographer who was noted for her sober, no-frills portrayal of post-World War II middle America, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her niece, Jean Bubley.         In the late 1930's, Ms. Bubley was  drawn to the picture essays in Life magazine and to the photography project of the Farm Security Administration. She studied painting and photography at the Minneapolis School of Art, and in 1942 became a microfilmer of rare books at the National Archives in Washington. The next year she was transferred to the darkrooms of the Office of War Information, which was headed by Roy Stryker, former director of the farm photography project.         She photographed Washington during her spare time, producing images that, in their loneliness, mystery and sadness, predated Robert Frank's book, ''The Americans,'' by more than a decade. In a Hopperesque image from 1943, one of the many young women who had flocked to the nation's capital to work for the war effort is shown sitting by herself at the end of a long, polished table, her arms folded, a cigarette in one hand. Her face is spotlighted, a look of almost painful solitude etched on it. In a kind of companion image,  taken the same year, a soldier in a photography booth looks lost in gloomy thoughts.         That year, Stryker assigned Ms. Bubley to photograph the transportation services available to soldiers and their families. It was the beginning of a long association that she regarded as the most important in her career. Also through Stryker, she was assigned to documentary projects by various companies and  magazine editors.         Ms. Bubley moved to New York in the mid-1940's. In 1952, her work was included in a group show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York that was part of a series titled ''Diogenes With a Camera'' (the other photographers in the exhibition were Edward Weston, Frederick Sommer, Harry Callahan, Eliot Porter and W. Eugene Smith). In 1955, three of Ms. Bubley's images of schoolgirls and young women appeared in the ''Family of Man'' exhibition at the Modern.         In the 1970's, Ms. Bubley embarked on a very different photographic project: macrophotography of plants. These images were compiled in a 1979 book, ''A Mysterious Presence: Macrophotography of Plants.'' In her luminous, extreme close-ups, the plants are sinuous abstractions or have the fantastical tactility of insects under a powerful magnifier. One image of air bubbles caught in a starburst of cornflower seed hairs is magically jewel-like.         Ms. Bubley's work appeared in  publications including Life, Look, Sports Illustrated, Ladies Home Journal, Harper's Bazaar, Time, Fortune and The New York Times Magazine. Before her death, she was preparing a book of her work, to be published next year by the Smithsonian Institution Press.         Her 1947 marriage to Edwin Locke, a writer, ended in divorce. She is survived by two sisters, Anita Greenspan of Bethesda, Md., and Claire Tepper of Falls Church, Va.       
         Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the widow of John Hay (Jock) Whitney, the first wife of James Roosevelt and the last of the three glamorous Cushing sisters of Boston, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 89.         Mrs. Whitney was one of the most prestigious figures in New York society, although she disliked publicity and rarely attended large social gatherings. When she did appear at an event, it was considered a coup.         In recent years, in failing health, Mrs. Whitney, a prominent philanthropist in medicine and art, spent most of her time at Greentree, one of the most magnificent private residences in the country, situated on 438 acres in Manhasset, on Long Island's Gold Coast. There, surrounded by an important Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art collection, gardens and greenhouses, Mrs. Whitney was looked after by 20 employees.         Mrs. Whitney was the second-born of the three Cushing sisters, who were renowned in the 1930's and 40's for their brilliant marriages into some of the most prominent families in the country. She inherited the bulk of one of the great American fortunes when Jock Whitney -- sportsman, financier, publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, philanthropist, political mover and shaker, and Ambassador to Britain -- died in 1982. In 1990, Forbes magazine estimated her wealth at $700 million.         Practicing the Art Of Marrying Well         From their debutante days, she and her sisters were celebrated by society chroniclers for their beauty and charm. Her older sister, Mary (Minnie) Cushing, was married to Vincent Astor, the wealthy real estate owner, and after a divorce, to James Whitney Fosburgh, an artist. She died in 1978 at 72. Barbara (Babe) Cushing, the youngest, was married to Stanley Mortimer Jr., a grandson of one of the founders of Standard Oil, and after a divorce, to William S. Paley, the legendary founder and chairman of the Columbia Broadcasting System.         Babe Paley, a perennial name on the world's best-dressed list and a glittering figure in society, also died in 1978, at 62, four months before her older sister.         Betsey Maria Cushing was born in Baltimore on May 18, 1908. Her father was Dr. Harvey Cushing, a neurosurgeon who was a professor of surgery at various times at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities. Her mother was Katherine Crowell Cushing, of a socially prominent family in Cleveland.         Dr. Cushing was a stern father, and Mrs. Whitney later recalled that ''perfectionism was drummed into us.'' The social skills that she learned at Miss May's, a private day school in Boston, and at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn., were burnished by her mother, who made certain that her daughters excelled in the arts of entertaining and running a household as prerequisites for the advantageous marriages she was determined they would have.         David Grafton, the author of the 1992 book ''The Sisters: The Lives and Times of the Fabulous Cushing Sisters'' (Villard Books), wrote that Katherine Cushing once told a gossip columnist that she expected her girls ''to marry into the highest level of European nobility or into America's moneyed aristocracy.''         There were also two brothers, William and Henry, neither of whom survives.         Although marriage into the Roosevelt family did not apparently meet her highest expectations, it merited no objections. Betsey Cushing met James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, when she was 22.         They married at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Brookline, Mass., on June 5, 1930, two days before the bridegroom's graduation from Harvard. Five hundred leaders of the social and political worlds of Boston and New York watched the bride, in a floor-length gown of silver lame, exchange vows with the son of the Governor of New York and his wife. Elliott Roosevelt was his brother's best man, and two other brothers, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. and John A. Roosevelt, were among the ushers. Minnie Cushing was the maid of honor, and Babe Cushing was a bridesmaid.         As a young married woman, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt ''could be imperious,'' the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst later told Mr. Paley's biographer, Sally Bedell Smith. But,  Ms. Smith wrote, ''Fortunately, Betsey redeemed herself with a rollicking sense of humor and an ability to kick up her heels.''         Not Exactly a Favorite Of Eleanor Roosevelt         The young Roosevelts spent their early married life living with the Cushings, while the bridegroom studied law at the Boston University Law School. When Mr. Roosevelt went into the insurance business, the couple bought a house and property in Framingham, Mass. After his father became President of the United States and chose him as an aide, the couple lived in Georgetown.         The young Mrs. Roosevelt was said to be the President's favorite daughter-in-law, but she enjoyed no such preference from Eleanor Roosevelt and was, in turn, not fond of her mother-in-law. ''The two women were simply too strong and too different in personal style and social preferences,'' Mr. Grafton wrote.         Betsey Roosevelt was often the hostess at the White House when Eleanor Roosevelt was absent. She was in the forefront on a summer day in 1939 when the President entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic in Hyde Park, N.Y., at which the King ate his first hot dog. Later that day, when the President took the King and Queen for a drive along the Hudson River, the President asked Betsey Roosevelt to go along for company in the car.         Always family-conscious, she enhanced Babe Cushing's debutante season by giving a tea dance at the White House as a second coming-out party. She also introduced Minnie Cushing to Vincent Astor, and the two were married in 1940 after Mr. Astor divorced his first wife.         Even as a member of the President's circle, Betsey Roosevelt preferred a private life, and she did her best to shield her two daughters, Sara and Kate, from the public eye.         In November 1938, James Roosevelt left the Government and went to Hollywood to work in the movie business as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. His wife followed him, but they separated, and early in 1940 it was disclosed that they were to be divorced. Mr. Roosevelt filed for divorce on grounds of desertion, and his wife filed a cross-complaint on grounds of desertion and cruelty.         In March 1940, Mrs. Roosevelt obtained a divorce decree. She was given custody of the children, child support, a settlement and further payments until she remarried.         Mr. Roosevelt went on to become a decorated Marine officer in World War II, a six-term Congressman from California and a delegate to the United Nations during the Johnson Administration. He died in 1991.         Early in 1942, rumors of a romance between Betsey Cushing Roosevelt and Jock Whitney began circulating in New York, Boston and Washington. He had been divorced in 1940 after 10 years of marriage to the former Mary Elizabeth Altemus.         The couple were married in a small, informal ceremony on March 1, 1942, in her widowed mother's East 86th Street apartment. The bride was 33 and the bridegroom 37.         After a honeymoon at Greenwood Plantation in Thomasville, Ga., one of Mr. Whitney's many residences, the newlyweds moved to Washington, where he ran the motion picture division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, headed by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Whitney later joined the Air Force, rose to colonel, was a German prisoner for 18 days in 1944 before escaping and got several decorations.         In 1949, Mr. Whitney adopted his wife's two daughters. The Whitneys moved to London in 1957, when President Eisenhower named Mr. Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Mrs. Whitney renewed her friendship with the Queen Mother, whom she had met on the 1939 visit to America. Both Ambassador and Mrs. Whitney became close to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.         Mrs. Whitney spent a good deal of her time making the Whitney residences comfortable and welcoming. In his book, Mr. Grafton quoted a friend of hers as saying, ''The Jock Whitneys are just about as 'down-to-earth' as any people can be with a quarter of a billion dollars.''         White House Is Nice, But It's No Greentree         The residences that Mrs. Whitney had at her disposal over the years included, in addition to Greentree on Long Island and the plantation in Georgia, a town house and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island near New London, Conn.; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races there; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Ga., and a spacious house in Surrey, England, not far from the Ascot racecourse.         E. J. Kahn, Mr. Whitney's biographer, reported that years later one of the daughters, Kate, once took her own children on a tour of the White House. Mr. Kahn wrote, ''After inspecting it, they pronounced it nice enough but hardly on a par with Greentree.''         In addition, the Whitneys shared a renowned Kentucky horse farm, which also bore the name Greentree, with Mr. Whitney's sister, Joan Whitney Payson. It was later sold.         Mrs. Whitney established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups, and she was its president. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950's on 15 acres donated by Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Payson.         Mrs. Whitney was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art, Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. The Modern received eight major paintings, by artists like Utrillo, Picasso and Seurat, from Mr. Whitney's estate, and Yale received six paintings, valued at $5 million at that time. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center received a $15 million gift.         After her husband's death in 1982, Mrs. Whitney gave $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art got nine American and French paintings, which had been placed in a charitable trust during Mr. Whitney's lifetime. The trust also gave $2 million for acquisitions, and Mrs. Whitney chose a Toulouse-Lautrec painting from her husband's collection, ''Marcelle Lender Dancing the Bolero in 'Chilperic,' '' to give the gallery in his memory.         Mrs. Whitney made art history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene ''At the Moulin de la Galette.'' It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction.         Among Mrs. Whitney's many public activities were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service.         She is survived by her daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, both of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Kasey Cisyk, an opera-trained singer who never made it to the Met but whose haunting coloratura soprano became one of the world's most listened-to voices, died on March 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 44 and had been the singing voice of the long-running ''Have You Driven a Ford Lately?'' advertising campaign.         Her family said the cause was breast cancer.         In the capricious world of show business, she never enjoyed splashy success, but in the backwaters of her profession, where most singers, after all, spend their entire careers, Miss Cisyk, a tiny, slender woman with a smile as big as her heart, made her share of waves.         She worked as a backup singer for Carly Simon and Quincy Jones; she dubbed the Oscar-winning title song for the 1977 movie ''You Light Up My Life,'' and in the demanding world of commercial jingles, she was a star, one whose very anonymity was a critical asset.         It allowed her, for example, to amass a list of credits that included such archrivals as ABC, NBC and CBS; McDonald's and Burger King, American and Delta airlines and even Coke and Pepsi.         And for all her long run with Ford, Miss Cisyk also sang in the service of Chevrolet, Cadillac and Toyota.         It was her work for Ford that made her the envy of her colleagues. From the time she became the voice of Ford in 1981 until the campaign was finally retired two months ago, hers was the most ubiquitous voice in the land. In 1989, when the campaign was nearing the midpoint of its 17-year run, an industry record for a corporate soloist, Ford executives estimated that Miss Cisyk had been heard by a cumulative audience of 20 billion.         Maybe not what she had in mind when she was studying opera at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan, but not at all bad for a Queens-born daughter of a Ukrainian virtuoso who wanted her to play the violin.         Miss Cisyk, whose father maintained a studio on the Lower East Side, learned the instrument when she was 5 (she also studied ballet), and after graduating from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, she dutifully accepted a violin scholarship to Mannes.         By the time she graduated she had switched to classical voice training, won encouraging praise for roles in student opera productions, and sung  ''Rigoletto'' in Ghent on a New York State scholarship in Belgium.         For all her promise, Miss Cisyk, whose father died when she was 17, was drawn away from opera and into the world of jingles by the pressing need to make a living.         She found work singing in clubs in New York, but for a while in the mid-70's she despaired of breaking into the tight-knit world of commercials. For months after she had circulated tapes to advertising agencies she heard nothing.         Then the executives got around to listening to the tapes, and the calls started coming in, slowly at first, but after six months of sporadic work, an entire industry seemed to make the simultaneous discovery that her voice was money in the bank.         Suddenly she was in such demand that a typical day, she later recalled, would begin with a 9 A.M. session for Trans World Airlines, followed by Coca-Cola at 11, Hartz Mountain at 1 P.M., Eastern Airlines at 2, Datsun at 3, L'Eggs at 5, McDonald's at 6, and, after all that, a recording session from 8:30 P.M. to 3 A.M.         By the time Ford came calling in 1981, she had learned to pace herself.         After an early marriage and divorce, she married Edward J. Rakowicz, a recording engineer, had a son, Edward W., now 7, and became as devoted a mother as she had been a dedicated singer.         But even after her cancer was diagnosed in 1992 and she began the long, painful ordeal of therapy, Miss Cisyk, who is also survived by her older sister, Maria, a concert pianist and teacher who lives in Ridgefield, Conn., continued to work, singing her last professional jingle just a few months ago.         She may never have made it to the Met or even had a popular hit record in the United States, but she was not a complete unknown in the world of music.         Miss Cisyk, whose given name was Kvita (Ukrainian for flower), adopted the professional name Kasey from her initials, intending to reserve Kvita for an opera career that never happened. She eventually found a use for it after all.         A woman who cherished her Ukrainian heritage, Miss Cisyk formed her own production company in 1988 and recorded two C.D.'s, one  (''Kvita'') of Ukrainian folk songs, the other (''Kvita Two Colors'') of Ukrainian love songs.         Both have been wildly popular among the 100 million far-flung Ukrainian expatriates and in Ukraine, where the woman who worked in the backwaters of American show business was regarded as a leading performer and is very much a household name.       
         Dr. Viola Wertheim Bernard, a prominent New York psychiatrist who found ways to help adopted and foster children feel at home in new surroundings, died on March 21 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 91 and also lived in Nyack, N.Y.         Her prescription for easing the way for adopted children into a new home was to arrange for them to visit the new place in advance. ''Helping children to see where they are going reduces the fear of strangeness,'' she advised.         Throughout her professional life, she worked to widen the applications of psychoanalytic theory to study and tackle social problems. A past vice president of the American Psychiatric Association, she won international recognition for her work in community and social psychiatry, child psychiatry and adoption.         In an association with Columbia University that spanned five decades, she founded its Division of Community and Social Psychiatry and directed it from 1956 to 1969. She was also a founder of what is now the Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. At her death, she was clinical professor emeritus at the Psychoanalytic Center for Training and Research at Columbia.         Dr. Bernard opened her Upper East Side medical practice in 1940 as a specialist in psychiatry and psychoanalysis. The author of about 100 papers and several books, she recently finished her latest article on the relevance of psychiatry and psychoanalysis in social contexts,  said Kathleen L. Kelly, an executor. It will appear in the forthcoming issue of The Psychoanalytic Review.         Dr. Bernard's writings also addressed topics like children and adolescents and their position in family, community and the law; mental health and the schools; community and social psychiatry and training, and the dynamics of psychiatry among the poor, particularly among minorities.         A Manhattan native, she graduated from New York University in 1933 and earned her medical degree from Cornell University Medical College in 1936. She trained in psychiatry and neurology at Jersey City Medical Center, Grasslands Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., and the New York State Psychiatric Institute and Hospital.         Dr. Bernard leaves no immediate family. She was married in the 1930's to Theos C. Bernard, an anthropologist, who died in 1948, 10 years after their divorce.       
         Tammy Wynette, whose 1968 hit ''Stand By Your Man'' established her as a queen of country music, died on Monday in her sleep at her home in Nashville. She was 55.         She recorded more than 50 albums and sold more than 30 million recordings. Ms. Wynette, who had a history of health problems, is believed to have died of a blood clot, said her publicist, Evelyn Shriver.         ''Stand By Your Man'' established Ms. Wynette in the role of a long-suffering but determinedly loyal wife, holding the family together even when her husband strayed. Her voice had a husky center, with melancholy balanced by determination; she sounded like an Everywoman with unexpected reserves of strength and affection. ''I'm not the best singer in the world, just the loudest,'' she once declared.         Working with the producer Billy Sherrill, with whom she wrote her biggest hit, she also became the standard-bearer of an elaborately orchestrated Nashville sound, with pedal steel guitars underlined by strings and backup choruses.         She became the first female country singer to have a million-selling album, and she had 20 No. 1 country hit singles in her career. But her own life was more turbulent, and less stable, than the lifelong attachments her songs promised.         She was born in 1942 in rural Itawamba County, Miss., named Virginia Wynette Pugh, and raised by her grandparents on a farm where she picked cotton. She was drawn to music, and learned to play guitar before her teen-age years, when she joined her mother in Birmingham, Ala.         A month before her high school graduation in 1959, she was married for the first time, to Euple Byrd. She had three daughters with him: Gwen, Jackie and Tina. In 1963, she enrolled in beautician's school in Tupelo, Miss.; she was divorced in 1965. Working by day as a beautician and at night as a singer in clubs, she began appearing on a local television program, the ''Country Boy Eddie Show,'' then on Porter Wagoner's nationally syndicated country television show.         In 1966, she moved to Nashville and auditioned for Mr. Sherrill, who signed her to Epic Records. He renamed her Tammy Wynette and recorded some honky-tonk-flavored songs: the ballad ''Apartment No. Nine'' and the uptempo ''Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad,'' her first Top 10 hit, in 1967. ''I Don't Wanna Play House'' reached No. 1 on the country charts and brought her a Grammy Award.         The three No. 1 hits she had in 1968 -- ''Stand By Your Man,'' ''Take Me to Your World'' and ''D-I-V-O-R-C-E'' -- established both her public image and her style, concentrating on weepers about holding a marriage together or declaring her unending love. ''Stand By Your Man'' sold more than two million copies. In it, she sang: ''Sometimes it's hard to be a woman, giving all your love to just one man. You'll have bad times and he'll have good times doin' things that you don't understand. But if you love him, you'll forgive him even though he's hard to understand. And if you love him, oh be proud of him 'cause after all he's just a man.''         She had married the songwriter Don Chapel in 1967, but the partnership lasted only a year. It ended when Ms. Wynette walked out on her husband to live with George Jones, the revered and, at the time, hard-drinking country singer. According to Mr. Jones's autobiography, ''I Lived to Tell It All'' (1996), he had fallen in love with Ms. Wynette while they were on tour together.         One night, visiting her at home, he walked in while she and her husband were having an argument. After kicking over a dining room table, Mr. Jones declared his love for her, and Ms. Wynette and her three daughters left Mr. Chapel that night. A day later, Mr. Jones and Ms. Wynette flew to Mexico for a quick divorce, only to find out on their return that Tennessee did not recognize Mexican divorces. Mr. Chapel sued Mr. Jones for alienation of affection and Ms. Wynette for divorce. But Mr. Jones's lawyers discovered that Mr. Chapel and Ms. Wynette had married illegally, because she had married too soon after her previous divorce.         As ''Stand By Your Man'' moved from country radio stations to the pop Top 20, Ms. Wynette married Mr. Jones in 1969, and they began billing themselves as ''Mr. and Mrs. Country Music.'' They moved to Lakeland, Fla.         ''Stand By Your Man'' brought Ms. Wynette a second Grammy Award as well as recognition from the Country Music Association; she was named female vocalist of the year in 1969 and 1970. She and Mr. Jones had a daughter, Georgette, in 1970. But the marriage was a troubled one. In her 1979 autobiography, ''Stand By Your Man,'' Ms. Wynette wrote that one night he menaced her with a rifle while in a drunken rage, firing in her direction as she ran from him and then shooting up their Lakeland mansion; his autobiography denies the account. The next morning, he was straitjacketed and hospitalized for 10 days.         From 1971 to 1980, she recorded duets with Mr. Jones. Among them were songs like ''We're Gonna Hold On,'' which appeared amid reports of their marital troubles and rumors of impending divorce. The duo had No. 1 country hits with ''Golden Ring'' and ''Near You.'' But their marriage could not survive Mr. Jones's drinking and the couple's increasingly bitter quarrels. In 1975 they were divorced, although they continued to record duets. Ms. Wynette married Michael Tomlin in 1976, then divorced him after 44 days. Two years later, she married George Richey, with whom she wrote the song '' 'Til I Can Make It on My Own.''         Ms. Wynette's career fluctuated in the 1980's, with Top 10 hits including ''Another Chance'' in 1982 and ''Sometimes When We Touch,'' a duet with Mark Gray, in 1985. She acted in the soap opera ''Capitol'' in 1986. But she also spent part of the year at the Betty Ford Clinic fighting an addiction to prescription painkillers. She was recognized as a major figure in country music, with younger performers including Emmylou Harris and Vince Gill appearing on her albums, but her songs reached the Top 20 less often.         Yet her voice was immediately recognizable. In 1992, she had an unexpected international hit when she sang ''Justified and Ancient'' with the English electronic dance group, the KLF. The song reached No. 1 in 18 countries.         In 1992, her name and best-known song entered the Presidential campaign when Hillary Rodham Clinton, stressing that her defense of her husband against charges of adultery was more than routine, said in a ''60 Minutes'' interview: ''I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.''         Ms. Wynette demanded, and received, an apology, declaring that Mrs. Clinton had ''offended every true country music fan'' and every person who has ''made it on their own with no one to take them to a White House.'' After the apology, Ms. Wynette performed at a Clinton fund-raiser. ''Her trademark style has filled our hearts and made her a legend,'' President Clinton said yesterday.         In 1993, Ms. Wynette made an album, ''Honky-Tonk Angels,'' with Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn. She was hospitalized in 1994 with an infection that left her in critical condition for a week. But she returned to touring and recording soon afterward, including a guest appearance on Elton John's album ''Duets.'' Her last recordings reunited her with Mr. Jones to sing duets on the 1996 album ''One.''         In addition to her husband, George Richey, she is survived by five daughters, Jackie Daly, Gwen Ignaczak and Tina Jones, all of Nashville, Georgette Smith of Alabama and Deirdre Richardson of Los Angeles; a son, Kelly Richardson of San Francisco and seven grandchildren.

         Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the spirited writer and environmentalist who was known as the patron saint of the Florida Everglades for her ceaseless campaign to preserve the fragile wetlands, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 108.         Mrs. Douglas, who prevailed in recent years over blindness, hearing difficulties and other ailments, died in the English-style cottage she had built on a leafy street in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood in 1926.         ''The years caught up with her,'' William T. Muir, a lawyer and friend, told The Associated Press. He said that after cremation, her remains would be scattered over a portion of  Everglades National Park that bears her name.         The author of many short stories, novels and works of nonfiction, Mrs. Douglas was best known for her 1947 call to arms, ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' which was at once a natural and political history and a  warning of what was to come if developers and other commercial interests were permitted to have their way with the unique wetlands that cover much of southern Florida.         The book became a best-seller and transformed public perception of the wetlands, which were then considered by most people to be useless swamps that should be drained and developed for farming and housing.  The novelist John Hersey, reviewing the book for The New York Herald Tribune, called it ''a remarkable almost poem'' and said that in the years to come, it would remain ''unique in any company.''         Mrs. Douglas began her book simply: ''There are no other Everglades in the world.''         ''The simplicity, the diversity, the related harmony of the forms of life they enclose. . . . It is a river of grass,'' she wrote.         Her phrase ''river of grass'' caught the public imagination but it was also a reference to the fact that the Everglades is really a vast, slow-moving stream of shallow water and saw grass that covers much of the final 100 miles of South Florida.         Mrs. Douglas was considered an authority on the delicate ecosystem of the Everglades, which is home to ibises, roseate spoonbills, wood storks, manatees, the threatened Florida panther and saltwater crocodile, and hundreds of other animals, fish and plants. But in her book she made her case with a rare blend of science, local lore and history, and shimmering writing: ''The clear burning light of the sun pours daylong into the saw grass and is lost there, soaked up, never given back. Only the water flashes and glints. The grass yields nothing.''         In 1947, the year her book was published, she also helped lead the campaign to have the central core of the Everglades preserved as Everglades National Park.         Long before water problems began to plague South Florida, Mrs. Douglas cried out against poor land management and the ill-planned creation of canals that, in effect, decreased the amount of fresh water in the Everglades and increased the amount of salt water, imperiling the ecosystem.         She deplored state and local policies that encouraged overdevelopment of the Everglades and threatened the very source water on which South Florida depends. Of the people of South Florida, she said, ''They could not get it through their heads that they had produced some of the worst conditions themselves, by their lack of cooperation, their selfishness, their mutual distrust and their willful refusal to consider the truth of the whole situation.''         She added that unless people acted more responsibly, ''overdrainage will go on'' and ''the soil will shrink and burn and be wasted and destroyed, in a continuing ruin.''         But in ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' she expressed the hope that ''perhaps even in this last hour, in a new relation of usefulness and beauty, the vast, magnificent, subtle and unique region of the Everglades may not be utterly lost.''         In 1969, she helped found Friends of the Everglades, a conservation organization that now has 5,000 members. Joe Podgor, the former executive director, called her ''the giant on whose shoulders we all stand.''         In 1990, on her 100th birthday, when she was blind and frail, she continued to speak out against those who plundered the Everglades. And as damaged as the Everglades were, the fact that any of it remained was in large measure a tribute to her perseverance.         Roderick J. Jude, a longtime leader of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, said, ''The Everglades wouldn't be there for us to try to continue to save if not for her work through the years.''         Once an area of more than 4,000 square miles, the Everglades has shrunk to less than half its original size, the result of overdrainage, urban sprawl and pollution from government-supported sugar cane and dairy farming. Many think its long-range future is still tenuous.         In 1996, President Clinton endorsed a project to protect the Everglades by spending several hundred million dollars to buy farmland, take it out of production and try to restore the kind of natural water flow that Mrs. Douglas warned the state it was in danger of losing.         The proposal was strongly opposed by farmers, who saw it as an erosion of agribusiness. The sugar farmers asserted it was not their activities that damaged the Everglades as much as government drainage and flood control projects that turned wetlands into dry land so that it could be used for urban development.         In 1996, the voters of Florida approved a constitutional amendment for the cleanup of the Everglades,  but rejected a penny-a-pound tax on sugar to pay for it. The sugar growers convinced a majority of voters that the tax would have cost thousands of jobs.         The following year the Clinton Administration and the State of Florida agreed to buy more than 50,000 acres of sugar cane fields on the outskirts of Everglades National Park, a step toward rescuing the endangered ecosystem from polluted runoff.         A comprehensive restoration plan for the Everglades is expected later this year from the Army Corps of Engineers, which together with the South Florida Water Management District, a state agency, has been directed by Congress to oversee the huge replumbing project designed to restore the flow of fresh, clean water on which the Everglades depends.         Marjory Stoneman was born April 7, 1890, in Minneapolis, the daughter of Frank and Lillian Stoneman. Her father was a judge who became the first editor of the paper that eventually became The Miami Herald; her mother was a concert violinist.         Mrs. Douglas was raised in Taunton, Mass., and went to Wellesley College, where she majored in English, graduating in the class of 1912. Two years later she married a newspaperman named Kenneth Douglas, but realizing her marriage was a mistake she went to Miami, where she became a reporter at her father's newspaper. During World War I, she served with the American Red Cross in France, Belgium, Italy and in the Balkans.         Back in Miami after the war, she obtained a divorce and was reunited with her father at The Herald, becoming assistant editor, writing editorials and editing a literary column called ''The Galley.'' Her editorial writing presaged ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' in that she began to explore the problems associated with Florida's rapid commercial development.         In 1923 she left The Herald to try free-lancing and sold her first story to The Saturday Evening Post. In 1928 she won second place in the O. Henry Memorial Prize for short story writing. In 1937, another of her short stories, ''Story of a Homely Woman,'' was included in a selection of the best Post stories published that year. Her first novel, ''Road to the Sun,'' which she worked on for 10 years, was published in 1951. It was the first of several works she would create for young readers.         Among Mrs. Douglas's other works were ''The Key to Paris,'' a book for young readers published in 1961, and a play, ''The Gallows Gate,'' in 1928. With John Rothchild she wrote ''Voice of the River,'' in 1987, an autobiography that told of her fierce advocacy of conservation measures to save the natural environment of South Florida.         Her short stories appeared in many magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and Women's Home Companion.         In addition to her writing, Mrs. Douglas taught at the University of Miami from 1925 to 1929 and also lectured at Pennsylvania State University in the late 1920's. She served on the editorial board of the University of Miami Press and for a time wrote book reviews. Among her other interests was the Junior Museum of Miami and the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Association. She was also a member of the Society of Women Geographers.         Mrs. Douglas, who had no immediate survivors, was honored in many ways. Queen Elizabeth visited her in 1991. Two years later, President Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The building in Tallahassee that houses the state Department of Environmental Protection is named for her. Also named for her are a nature center in Key Biscayne and several schools and parks elsewhere in Florida.         President Clinton said of Mrs. Douglas in a statement from Germany, ''Long before there was an Earth Day, Mrs. Douglas was a passionate steward of our nation's natural resources, and particularly her Florida Everglades.''         On her 100th birthday, Marjory Stoneman Douglas was asked if she had hope for the Everglades' survival. She answered: ''I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I say it's got to be done.''       
         Nicole Maxwell, a free-spirited San Francisco debutante who plunged into the remote Amazon jungles of Ecuador and Peru and came out with a trove of medicinal plants that she said Indians used to cure virtually every known ailment, died on May 5 in a nursing home in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 92, and left no immediate survivors.         Mrs. Maxwell, the author of the 1961 book ''Witch Doctor's Apprentice,'' had spent the last decades of her life in largely vain efforts to interest drug companies in her discoveries.         For a woman who was the toast of Paris in the 1920's, dancing ballet with the Opera, dallying with a raft of admirers and posing nude for artists, Mrs. Maxwell made an abrupt change in her life: After a 12-year marriage to an Air Force officer ended in 1945 (''I married a lieutenant and divorced a brigadier general''), she headed to South America to visit friends in Bolivia, later saying that since she had never been attracted to Latin men, she hoped to avoid distracting entanglements.         Whatever the distractions, Mrs. Maxwell stayed in South America for 12 years, running the first shoe-string tourist service in Lima, Peru, and later becoming a roving correspondent for The Lima Times.         It was during a chance venture into the jungle on a visit to Quito, Ecuador, in 1947 that Mrs. Maxwell first became fascinated with the jungles of the upper Amazon basin and its indigenous tribes.         Hacking her way through the jungle with an Indian guide the next year, she suffered a deep machete gash on her arm and made the discovery that would change her life.         With Mrs. Maxwell wondering whether she would bleed to death or die from infection, the guide ran into the jungle, returned with some dark red tree sap and had her drink it. When the bleeding stopped within minutes and the wound healed rapidly without a scar, Mrs. Maxwell knew she had found her life's work: ferreting out remedies used by the Indians for centuries and introducing them to the modern world.         The very idea of medicine struck a chord deep in her psyche. Growing up in a wealthy Christian Science family in San Francisco, Mrs. Maxwell had harbored a grudge against the religion ever since she broke her arm when she was 9 and was denied medical treatment until she went to a doctor on her own.         It was a streak of independence that would resurface a few years later when she contracted a teen-age marriage of convenience simply to escape her family, then obtained a divorce as soon as the couple reached Paris.         During her later marriage, when her Air Force husband was posted to Cambridge, Mass., Mrs. Maxwell talked the chairman of the Harvard biology department into helping her sign up for postgraduate courses.         By the time her husband was transferred to Ohio, Harvard professors had arranged for her to continue her studies at Ohio State. But when her husband was transferred to Washington a couple of years later, her unofficial formal education came to an end because Georgetown University would not admit women.         In the decade after her machete experience, Mrs. Maxwell made dozens of expeditions to the remotest regions of the upper Amazon, befriending the local Indians and slowly learning the secrets of their vast medical lore. To Indians whose experience with outsiders had been as victims of armed rubber merchants, an unarmed woman posed no threat.         In 1958, after obtaining a small grant from a drug company, Mrs. Maxwell made a special expedition, obtaining samples of many of the plants whose medicinal properties she had been carefully cataloguing.         When she returned and shipped her plants, including what she said was a variety of highly effective contraceptives, to the drug company, she was dismayed to discover that the company had regarded her trek as a publicity stunt and had no scientific interest in her findings.         Hoping to salvage something from her work, she wrote ''Witch Doctor's Apprentice.'' More adventure story than medical manual, the book, revised in 1975 and in 1990 (Citadel Press), nevertheless described a host of plants she said the Indians used to prevent tooth decay, painlessly extract teeth, dissolve kidney stones, heal burns and cure or prevent scores of other maladies.         Mrs. Maxwell returned to South America and continued her research until 1986, eventually collecting more than 350 plants used to treat more than 100 common ailments.         While her work was shunned by drug companies, Mrs. Maxwell, who made her home in Iquitos, Peru, became a heroine to a coterie of enthusiasts who would make pilgrimages to the compound where she held court to pay tribute, sometimes with unsettling results.         Once when an avid photographer of exotic birds gushingly exclaimed that she must be very familiar with the birds of South America, Mrs. Maxwell acknowledged that she was, ''mainly by taste.''         Her dream that the plants of the upper Amazon would become a multibillion-dollar cash crop and halt the destruction of the rain forest eluded her. But Mrs. Maxwell, who had been working with a Mississippi State scientist to produce a technical manual on Amazon remedies, remained confident that her work would be eventually be recognized by mainstream science.         ''As soon as I'm gone,'' she told a friend, ''they'll come running.''       
         Dorothy Spence Briley, the editor in chief and publisher of Clarion Books and a vice president of the trade and reference division of the Houghton Mifflin Company, died last Sunday at her home in New York City. She was 63.         She died of a heart attack, said her daughter, Karen Spence.         Mrs. Briley was born in Nashville and graduated from Vanderbilt University. She worked first at the Methodist Publishing House in Nashville, then in 1962 joined its children's department, Abingdon Press, in New York City. She later worked at Viking Press and E. P. Dutton, then led the children's departments at Van Nostrand, J. P. Lippincott and Lothrop, Lee & Shepard.         She moved to Clarion in 1989. In recent years, Clarion titles have won the Newbery and Caldecott Medals, the Laura Ingalls Wilder Award and the Hans Christian Andersen Award. Mrs. Briley edited the acclaimed biographies by Russell Freedman and illustrated books by David Wiesner and Jim Murphy, among others.         Mrs. Briley's two marriages ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York City, she is survived by a son, Michael Spence of New York, and a grandson.       
         Alice Faye, one of the few movie stars to walk away from stardom at the peak of her career, died yesterday at Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was in her mid-80's.         The cause was cancer, according to her publicity company, Jewel Baxter, which said she had had two stomach tumors removed last month.         Ms. Faye's warm, husky contralto and demure sexuality in ''Tin Pan Alley,'' ''Hello, Frisco, Hello'' and ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' made her one of Hollywood's top 10 moneymaking stars in 1938 and 1939. Under contract to 20th Century Fox for a little over a decade, during which she made 32 movies, Ms. Faye walked out in 1945 after Darryl Zanuck, the studio's leader, chopped up her scenes in ''Fallen Angel'' to highlight the performance of a younger Fox star, Linda Darnell.         Ms. Faye handed the keys to her dressing room to the studio gate guard and drove off the lot.         ''When I stopped making pictures,'' she told an interviewer in 1987, ''it didn't bother me because there were so many things I hadn't done. I had never learned to run a house. I didn't know how to cook. I didn't know how to shop. So all these things filled all those gaps.''         It was that attitude of taking life as it came without shaking her fist at fate that informed many of her screen performances. She was the honest, good-hearted girl who stood by her man. And when that man did her wrong, her response was to sing a torch song and love him harder. Off screen she had an unlikely but happy marriage to the brash band leader Phil Harris, whom she married in 1941. Hollywood gossip columnists gave the marriage six months, but it lasted 54 years, until Mr. Harris's death at the age of 91 in 1995. They had lived for many years in Rancho Mirage, near Palm Springs.         Ms. Faye, whose original name was Alice Leppert, was the daughter of a New York City policeman and grew up in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood of Manhattan. Although some books list her birth date as 1912, she insisted she was born in 1915 but had lied about her age when she joined the Chester Hale vaudeville troupe at 13.         After several years in the chorus,  Alice Faye, still a teen-ager, got a job on Broadway in ''George White's Scandals of 1931,'' which starred Ethel Merman, Ray Bolger and Rudy Vallee. She sang ''Mimi'' at a cast party, and Mr. Vallee hired her as a singer on his radio show. When  ''Scandals'' was made into the Fox film ''George White's Scandals of 1934,'' Ms. Faye replaced Lillian Harvey as Mr. Vallee's love interest.  Mr. Vallee's wife sued for divorce, naming Ms. Faye as his love interest off screen as well.         Fox put Ms. Faye under contract and presented her as a brassy imitation Jean Harlow in movies like ''She Learned About Sailors'' and ''King of Burlesque.'' After Mr. Zanuck's 20th Century Films merged with Fox in 1935, the studio softened her image. Jack Kroll of Newsweek once called her ''a luscious marshmallow sundae of a girl,'' and her ripe figure fit the many period movies like ''Little Old New York'' and ''In Old Chicago'' in which she sang to Don Ameche, Tyrone Power or John Payne from the stage of a saloon.         Mr. Ameche lost her to Mr. Power in ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' and ''In Old Chicago'' but won her affections in ''You Can't Have Everything,'' ''Hollywood Cavalcade,'' ''Lillian Russell'' and ''That Night in Rio.''         It was the one-two punch of ''In Old Chicago'' and ''Alexander's Ragtime Band'' in 1938 that made Ms. Faye a top box-office draw. A year later she and Mr. Power were teamed for the last time in ''Rose of Washington Square,'' a fictionalization of the Nicky Arnstein-Fanny Brice story that was later the basis for the Broadway and Hollywood musical ''Funny Girl,'' which starred Barbra Streisand. Ms. Faye had been responsible for Mr. Power's stardom. In 1936, when he was only an extra, she insisted that Fox test him.         Her voice was inviting, and Irving Berlin once said he would choose Ms. Faye over any other singer to introduce his songs. In 1937, George Gershwin and Cole Porter called her the best female singer in Hollywood. In ''Rose of Washington Square,'' with tears in her eyes, Ms. Faye poured her love and faith in her no-good man into ''My Man.'' But the song with which she is most closely associated is the Academy Award-winning ballad ''You'll Never Know'' from ''Tin Pan Alley.''         An early marriage to Tony Martin, a singer, ended in divorce after three years when Ms. Faye had become a star and Mr. Martin had not succeeded in the movies. When she remarried, she said, she was determined not to let that happen again. She and Mr. Harris were the parents of two daughters by the time she walked off the Fox lot after ''Fallen Angel.''         Ms. Faye had tried to change her screen image in that film noir melodrama, as the wife whose husband wants to dump her for the character played by Ms. Darnell. When she saw how Mr. Zanuck had edited the movie, she decided it would be a failure, telling an interviewer decades later, ''I couldn't see anything coming for me but the same old dumb things.''         So she spent the next eight years raising her children and appearing with her husband on a successful Sunday evening radio program, ''The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show.''         Ms. Faye is survived by her daughters, Alice Regan and Phyllis Harris; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         In 1962 Ms. Faye returned to 20th Century Fox as Pat Boone's mother in a poorly received remake of ''State Fair.'' In 1973 she toured in a revival of ''Good News,'' and in 1976 joined other golden-era stars in cameo roles in ''Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood.''         In 1984 Ms. Faye became a spokeswoman for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, encouraging ''young elders'' to live a healthy life. In 1990, she was co-author of a book, ''Growing Older, Staying Young,'' with Dick Kleiner.         Reminiscing about her years at Fox, Ms. Faye described the studio as a kind of penitentiary.         ''So I decided to make a new life for myself,'' she said. ''A home life. I had been chauffeured to work, made up, dressed, given my meals and chauffeured back home. I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to be independent. I equated independence with seeing daylight during the week and learning how to drive a car.''         Correction:  May 11, 1998, Monday  An obituary of the actress and singer Alice Faye in some editions yesterday misidentified the source of the song ''You'll Never Know,'' which won an Academy Award in 1944. It was from the film ''Hello, Frisco, Hello,'' not ''Tin Pan Alley.'' The obituary is reprinted today on page A15 for readers who did not receive it.

But the song with which she is most closely associated is the Academy Award-winning ballad ''You'll Never Know'' from ''Hello, Frisco, Hello.''         An early marriage to Tony Martin, a singer, ended in divorce after three years when Ms. Faye had become a star and Mr. Martin had not succeeded in the movies. When she remarried, she said, she was determined not to let that happen again. She and Mr. Harris were the parents of two daughters by the time she walked off the Fox lot after ''Fallen Angel.''         Ms. Faye had tried to change her screen image in that film noir melodrama, as the wife whose husband wants to dump her for the character played by Ms. Darnell. When she saw how Mr. Zanuck had edited the movie, she decided it would be a failure, telling an interviewer decades later, ''I couldn't see anything coming for me but the same old dumb things.''         So she spent the next eight years raising her children and appearing with her husband on a successful Sunday evening radio program, ''The Phil Harris-Alice Faye Show.''         Ms. Faye is survived by her daughters, Alice Regan and Phyllis Harris; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         In 1962 Ms. Faye returned to 20th Century Fox as Pat Boone's mother in a poorly received remake of ''State Fair.'' In 1973 she toured with John Payne in a revival of ''Good News,'' and in 1976 joined other golden-era stars in cameo roles in ''Won Ton Ton, the Dog Who Saved Hollywood.''         In 1984 Ms. Faye became a spokeswoman for Pfizer Pharmaceuticals, encouraging ''young elders'' to live a healthy life. In 1990, she was co-author of a book, ''Growing Older, Staying Young,'' with Dick Kleiner.         Reminiscing about her years at Fox, Ms. Faye described the studio as a kind of penitentiary.         ''So I decided to make a new life for myself,'' she said. ''A home life. I had been chauffeured to work, made up, dressed, given my meals and chauffeured back home. I thought, wouldn't it be wonderful to be independent. I equated independence with seeing daylight during the week and learning how to drive a car.''       
         Mary Elizabeth Grenander, a longtime professor of English who was an authority on the American writer Ambrose Bierce, known for his satirical wit and his horror stories, died in her sleep on Thursday at her home in East Berne, N.Y. She was 79.         Professor Grenander, known as M. E. Grenander, taught at the State University of New York at Albany  from 1948 until she retired in 1989 as a Distinguished Service Professor of English. She was a former president of the New York American Studies Association.         Her many writings about Bierce, who was born in 1842 and went to Mexico in 1913 and vanished, appeared during more than two decades. Analyzing horror stories he wrote, she once said: ''The actual situation is harmful, with the protagonist conceiving it to be harmless and reacting accordingly.''         She edited and wrote the introduction for the book ''Poems of Ambrose Bierce'' (1995, Nebraska), which the literary journal American Notes and Queries, or ANQ, called ''a provocative volume'' that ''should spark further interest in Bierce.''         Professor Grenander received a Fulbright Fellowship and grants from institutions including the National Endowment for the Humanities, the New York Council for the Humanities and the Rockefeller Foundation.         She gave more than $1 million to SUNY Albany, including $500,000 to establish a professorship in memory of her husband, James W. Corbett, a  professor of physics at the same university, who died in 1994. Lisa James of the university's Office of University Relations said that Professor Grenander and her husband prospered ''through long-term investments in the stock market.''         She was born in Rewey, Wis., and received bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate, all in English from the University of Chicago, in the 1940's.         Her marriage to Jean Louis Auclair ended in divorce. She married Professor Corbett in 1972.         She is survived by two sisters, Charlotte White of Puyallup, Wash.,  and Karen Hanley of Miami, Fla.       
         Mary Arnold Cahan, a New York socialite who helped organize annual benefits for the Costume Institute at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Tuesday in her home on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 71.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cahan, who was known as Sisi, was associated with the museum from 1972 to 1989 as a senior development associate. She was director of public relations for Peter Marino & Associates, a New York architectural firm, from 1989 to 1992.         A native of Norfolk, Va., she graduated from Vassar College in 1947.         Her marriage to Dr. William Cahan, a resident of Manhattan, ended in divorce in 1974.         She is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and Anthony, of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.       
         Mary Bancroft Boulton, a psychotherapist who helped introduce to New York City the practice of transactional analysis, which tries to help a patient correct self-destructive behavior patterns in relationships with other people, died at her home in Greenwich Village on May 30. She was 86.         Transactional analysis became popular after Dr. Eric Berne published ''Games People Play'' in 1964 (reissued in paperback by Ballantine Books in 1996). Dr. Boulton studied with Dr. Berne in San Francisco, then brought the new therapy to New York in 1966 when she founded the New York Transactional Analysis Seminar with Dr. Marian Weisberg and Dr. Barbara Rosenfeld.         Transactional analysis, often done in group therapy, delves into the multiple roles each person plays, as a child or parent, for example. One of Dr. Boulton's sons, John Bancroft, said, ''She would often say to me, 'Well, that's your child speaking,' or, 'That's your parent speaking.' ''         Dr. Boulton was also concerned with the roles thrust upon her patients, particularly women, by society.         In one article, she said patients not only needed to escape from the smothering influence of demanding parents but also needed to defy ''the 'big guns' of our culture -- traditional religious teaching, educational practice, literature, television, and the toys and games which are prescribed for boys and girls.''         The New York seminar, modeled after one run by Dr. Berne, was open to any psychotherapists who wanted to learn the new therapy, Dr. Weisberg said.         The seminar met until 1973, when Dr. Boulton and Dr. Weisberg opened the Gotham Institute for Transactional Analysis, a training institute that closed in 1978. Dr. Boulton continued her private practice until she retired in 1990.         Dr. Boulton was born Mary Elizabeth Holzman in Cincinnati on Aug. 9, 1911. She received a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Cincinnati in 1932 and a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania in 1935. She received her Ph.D. in 1980 from Northern Indiana University.         She married Frank Bancroft in 1935, and they were both active in left-wing causes.         Mr. Bancroft died in 1959. Dr. Boulton married John Wallace in 1962; the marriage ended in divorce.         Dr. Boulton married Schroeder Boulton in 1965, and their home in Greenwich Village became a gathering spot for people in civil rights and antiwar work, Mr. Bancroft said.         Dr. Boulton is survived by her husband; three sons, Carter Bancroft, of Huntington, N.Y., and Michael and John Bancroft, both of Seattle; three stepdaughters, Janet Boulton, of New York, Nancy Boulton, of Lincoln, Mass., and Tiffany Wallace, of Lexington, Ky., and seven grandchildren.       
         Gloria F. Ross, a widely known tapestry maker who brought painters and weavers together to create contemporary wall hangings, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, her son Clifford A. Ross said.         Translating paint into wool, as she put it, Ms. Ross worked with Robert Motherwell, Louise Nevelson, Jean Dubuffet, Frank Stella, Jack Youngerman, Romare Bearden and more than two dozen other artists to make tapestries of their paintings. The actual weaving was done by professionals in Felletin, a small French town near Aubusson, and at the Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh, although Ms. Ross played a hands-on role in the process.         During the 1980's, realizing that the chevrons and targets of Kenneth Noland's paintings were a perfect match for the Navajo loom and color range, Ms. Ross developed a series designed by Mr. Noland and hand-woven by Navajo weavers in Arizona and New Mexico.         Her tapestries were collected by individuals, corporations and museums. Work by Motherwell and Helen Frankenthaler rendered as tapestries, for example, hangs in the entrance to the Philadelphia Convention Center, and museums owning Ross tapestries include the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Textile Museum in Washington and the Denver Art Museum.         In 1997, although retired from professional work, Ms. Ross was active in the production of an ark curtain designed by Mark Podwol for Temple Emanu-El in New York. That year she also founded the Gloria F. Ross Center for Tapestry Studies in Tucson, Ariz., a nonprofit research institute and educational foundation. The center grew from her belief in tapestry as ''a vital contemporary art form with rich historical connections,'' said Dr. Ann Lane Hedlund, chairman of its board. The center sponsors public lectures, workshops, research projects and exhibitions devoted to tapestries, from prehistory to the present.         During her travels in the Southwest, Ms. Ross collected Navajo rugs and other textiles of native design, which she donated to the Denver Art Museum. An exhibition of them organized by the museum and supported by the National Endowment for the Arts toured the country from 1992 to 1997, ending at the National Museum of the American Indian in New York.         Born in New York on Sept. 5, 1923, Ms. Ross was the daughter of Justice Alfred Frankenthaler of the New York State Supreme Court and Martha Lowenstein Frankenthaler. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1943. Her first marriage, to Arthur Ross, ended in divorce in 1970. In 1975, she married Dr. John Bookman, a nutrition and diabetes specialist at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He died in 1988.         Ms. Ross served on the Mount Holyoke College board of trustees from 1986 to 1991, and on the advisory board of the college's art museum from 1975 on. Since 1991 she had been an active trustee of the Textile Museum.         Besides her son Clifford, she is survived by another son, Alfred F. Ross, of New York City; a daughter, Beverly Ross; two sisters, Marjorie Iseman and Helen Frankenthaler, the artist, both of New York; a stepdaughter, Ann Bookman of Brookline, Mass.; a stepson, Richard Bookman of Coral Gables, Fla.; two grandchildren, four step-grandchildren and her companion, Henry Kohn, also of New York.         Correction:  June 26, 1998, Friday  An obituary of the tapestry designer Gloria F. Ross on Tuesday misstated the position of Dr. Ann Lane Hedlund at the Gloria F. Ross Center for Tapestry Studies in Tucson, Ariz. She is the center's director, not head of its board.       
         Julia Perles, a longtime Manhattan lawyer who played an important part in bringing about a significant change in New York State's divorce legislation, died early Wednesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla. She was 84 and had lived in Sarasota for about four years.         The cause was not immediately clear, but she had had a fall at her home, said Janet Post, a friend.         Ms. Perles is widely considered to have played the leading role in bringing about the passage of what is popularly known as New York State's equitable distribution law, which went into effect in 1980. The law brought about what its admirers have called a revolutionary change in the practice of matrimonial law and in the rights of marital partners.         At her death, Ms. Perles was still affiliated with the law firm of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon, based in Manhattan, where she became a partner in 1970, having been invited by Louis Nizer to head the firm's matrimonial practice.         She went on to become a senior partner until about eight years ago,  and remained head of her department until she moved to Florida. After that, she continued to be affiliated with the firm and its matrimonial department.         While she was practicing matrimonial law, she became chairwoman of a special committee of the New York County Lawyers Association. The panel's members were respected specialists in marital law who favored getting the equitable-distribution change made in the state law. Committee members communicated with the State Legislature in Albany repeatedly, former colleagues of Ms. Perles recalled, and it took much attention and perseverance to persuade the Legislature to make the change.         Under the law as it was passed in 1980, both spouses, in the event of a divorce, are enabled to share equitably in the assets that either or both of them have accumulated during the marriage, even if title to the property -- a house for instance, or a business -- is in the name of only one spouse. Parties to a marriage did not have that legal right in New York State before the law was passed.         The underlying assumption behind the law is that both parties to a marriage contribute to the acquisition, maintenance and growth of the marital assets.         Ms. Perles's clients over the years included Woody Allen; Nancy Allen, the actress-wife of Brian De Palma, the movie director; the former Eve Ella Sherpick Green, the first wife of Harry B. Helmsley, the New York real estate titan; David Merrick, the producer; and Ethel Scull, who once was called the doyenne of the pop art world.         Ms. Perles was a former president of the New York Women's Bar Association, a fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and a member of the Dirty Thirty, an organization of American lawyers prominent in the field of matrimonial law.         She was born and raised in Brooklyn, and she wanted to be a lawyer from the time she was 12 years old. Rona J. Shays, a close friend, recalled that Ms. Perles used to say that her own mother had not wanted her to go to law school and had said to her, ''No one will want to marry you if they think you're smarter than they are.''         Nevertheless, Ms. Perles went on to attend Brooklyn College, and she received her law degree in 1937 from Brooklyn Law School.         She was an associate in the Manhattan law firm of Schwartz & Frohlich from 1942 to 1952 and then a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Greenbaum Wolff & Ernst before going to Phillips, Nizer.         In 1951 she married Howard Singer. He died in 1989.         Her survivors include a brother, David Perles, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Patsy Southgate, a writer and translator who helped inspire the literary flowering of Paris in the 1950's and later helped establish the writers' colony on eastern Long Island, becoming a beloved intimate of many of the leading artists of her day, died on July 18 at the Stony Brook University Hospital and Medical Center. A resident of Springs, N.Y., she was 70, and for a decade had been reviewing plays and writing profiles for The East Hampton Star. Her family said the cause was a stroke.         If her own poems, short stories, plays, and an unpublished novel did not put her in a league with the coterie of young writers who gravitated to her orbit in Paris, it was partly because they included such literary luminaries as William Styron, James Baldwin, Richard Wright, Terry Southern, a middle-aged Irwin Shaw and her own husband, Peter Matthiessen.         Even so, Miss Southgate, a woman of fierce intelligence, bitingly funny wit and high-spirited sense of fun, made her mark on literary Paris simply by being her ineffable self.         For one thing, in a city that treasures beauty she was renowned as the most beautiful woman in Paris. A clean-cut American beauty whose finely chiseled features were set off by surprisingly full lips generally framing a dazzling, inviting smile, Miss Southgate, whose animated beauty generally confounded the camera, was blond to her eyelids and had such a steady, open gaze it was said that to look into her deep blue eyes was to fall in love.         In Paris, where falling in love is easy, the only men in the tight-knit American expatriate colony who seemed to have avoided falling in love with her were those who were falling in love with one another, though that was not always sufficient defense against Miss Southgate's captivating charm: On Long Island, she became famous for her deeply loving relationships with gay artists and poets, most notably Frank O'Hara, the poet whose companion, Joe LeSueur, actually moved in with Miss Southgate after Mr. O'Hara's death in 1966.         A native of New York who grew up in Washington, where her father was chief of protocol for the Roosevelt White House, Miss Southgate, a 1950 Smith College graduate, was a perennial pioneer.         A member, along with Mr. Matthiessen, of the first class of the Smith-Yale junior year abroad program that helped establish Paris as a romantic way station for a generation of young Americans, Miss Southgate was ahead of her time even in her vaunted beauty. In an era when the Hollywood ideal was the shapely starlet with an overflowing bosom, her trim form prefigured a later esthetic of sturdy athleticism.         At a time when the young American writers were self-consciously trying to recreate the fabled Paris of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway and other 1920's expatriates,  Miss Southgate, though sane, was the Zelda Fitzgerald of the 1950's.         But if there was more meaning than madness in her madcap ways, Miss Southgate had her transcendent moments. Once during the tempestuous courtship that preceded their tempestuous marriage, when a row between Miss Southgate and Mr. Matthiessen was followed by a sulking two-day silence followed by an evening phone call that failed to patch things up, Mr. Matthiessen was startled an hour or so later by a late-night banging on the door of his Paris student lodgings.         When his disapproving landlady opened the door to Miss Southgate, who had thrown on her clothes and traveled halfway across Paris after the dispiriting phone call, it took her only a moment to add to her legend as a master of the inspired spontaneous gesture.         ''I thought you needed this,'' she told Mr. Matthiessen as she handed him an orange and departed, leaving him to marvel, as he still does, that it was exactly what he needed.         After marrying, graduating and returning to Paris in 1951, the Matthiessens were instant leaders of a  bohemian life that included legendary late-night revels at the Cafe de Tournon, Le Champlain or the Dome. Even their apartment, a multilevel, Paris-perfect studio walkup at 14 Rue Perceval with a balcony overlooking the Montparnasse rail yards, became the stuff of legend.         Mr. Styron made it a major setting for his 1960 novel, ''Set This House on Fire,'' and it was there that Mr. Matthiessen and Harold L. Humes founded The Paris Review, summoning Mr. Matthiessen's boyhood friend, George Plimpton, from his studies at Cambridge University to run it.         For all the publication's later acclaim, it is an open question whether the writers who gathered there would have been as willing to discuss the harebrained scheme if Miss Southgate had not been present as additional lure.         After Miss Southgate gave birth in 1952 to a child who lived only 12 hours, the couple took the precaution of moving to a ground-floor apartment for her next pregnancy, so she would not have to walk up stairs. Their son, Lucas, and The Paris Review both came out in the spring of 1953, with both parents represented by French translations.         Before the year was out they had returned to the United States and settled on Long Island, where as practically the only writers in the vicinity they fell in almost by default with their neighbor Jackson Pollock and other artists.         After the couple were divorced in 1956, Miss Southgate, whose later marriage to the artist Mike Goldberg also ended in divorce, became a fixture in the Long Island art scene, forming close friendships with Willem de Kooning, Larry Rivers and other acclaimed painters even as she continued her own work, contributing to The Evergreen Review, translating a series of books from French and eventually finding her late-life niche with The East Hampton Star.         While her fabled beauty faded, her appeal did not. At her death, her hair was as blond as ever and her eyes just as blue.         She is survived by two children, Lucas and Sara Matthiessen, both of East Northport, and two grandsons.       
         Kay Thompson, an entertainer who became the author of the hugely successful book ''Eloise,'' about a bratty child living at the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, died on Thursday. She lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan with her goddaughter, Liza Minnelli. She was taken from the apartment to Lenox Hill Hospital, but her longtime lawyer Arthur E. Abelman said it was unclear where she died. She was between 92 and 95,  Mr. Abelman, estimated.         The daughter of a St. Louis jeweler, Ms. Thompson was a pianist with the St. Louis Symphony in 1928.  ''I was a stage-struck kid,'' she recalled later, ''and I got out of St. Louis fast.''         She became a singer with the Mills Brothers on radio, an arranger and singer with Fred Waring's Band and co-producer of ''Kay Thompson and Company,'' a CBS radio show. She also worked as an arranger and songwriter for ''The Ziegfeld Follies'' and other movies, and performed in nightclubs, singing with the Williams Brothers from 1947 to 1953.         As The New York Herald Tribune reported in 1958, ''Eloise's birth was unexpected. At rehearsals of her act with the Williams Brothers, Ms. Thompson prized punctuality. Then one day she was late. In a high, childish voice that she had never used before, she made her apology. One of her co-workers said, 'Who are you, little girl?' Ms. Thompson replied, 'I am Eloise. I am 6.' The others joined in the game, each assuming a juvenile identity, and it became a regular rehearsal pastime.'' The routine became a book after Ms. Thompson began performing in 1954 in a one-woman show at the Plaza.         While she was appearing in the hotel's Persian Room, she was introduced to an artist, Hilary Knight, and he became the illustrator of ''Eloise,'' which was subtitled ''A Book for Precocious Grown Ups.'' Ms. Thompson wrote the book during a three-month break from performing.         Later she wrote three other books about Eloise, which were also illustrated by Mr. Knight.         In the first two years after ''Eloise'' came out, 150,000 copies were sold. Looking back in 1957, Publisher's Weekly said: ''As everyone who can read must know, Eloise is an overprivileged 6-year-old, the terror of the Hotel Plaza in New York. She is also ill-mannered, ill-tempered and ugly. But she has her charm. She often means well, and her mother neglects her. Even though you know that you would do the same thing if she were yours, you can't help finding this appealing.''         Kim Bouchard, a senior publicist at Simon & Schuster, Ms. Thompson's publisher, said that according to records beginning in 1983, 592,000 copies of ''Eloise'' have been sold in the United States since 1983.         The other Eloise books are ''Eloise in Paris'' (1957), ''Eloise at Christmastime'' (1958) and ''Eloise in Moscow'' (1959).         Ms. Thompson also wrote ''Kay Thompson's Miss Pooky Peckinpaugh and Her Secret Private Boyfriends Complete with Telephone Numbers'' (1970).         Ms. Thompson founded Eloise Ltd., which made recordings and other products related to the Eloise character. She also acted in movies, including ''Funny Face,'' and on television.         Friends said her first marriage, in the 1930's, to Jack Jenney, a trombonist, ended in divorce, as did her later marriage to William Spier, a radio producer.       
         Dorothy Manners Haskell, who became the Hollywood columnist for the Hearst Corporation after 30 years as the assistant to its syndicated columnist Louella Parsons, died on Tuesday at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 95.         Writing under the name Dorothy Manners, she took over when Parsons retired in 1965 and wrote a syndicated column for King Features, the Hearst subsidiary, until her own retirement in 1977.         In her heyday, Miss Manners was a frequent guest on the television talk shows of Steve Allen, Joey Bishop, Dick Cavett and Mike Douglas, and she was cited by the California Women's Press Club in 1966 as entertainment columnist of the year.         Miss Manners was born on July 30, 1903, in Fort Worth. When her parents divorced in 1919, she moved to Hollywood with her mother and began a career as an actress.         She appeared as an extra in films starring Gloria Swanson, Douglas Fairbanks and William Powell, and acted under the direction of Cecil B. DeMille.         But by her own admission she was an unexceptional actress, and she decided to become a writer. She began with The Hollywood Citizen and was soon hired by The Los Angeles Times to write entertainment features.         Shortly thereafter, she joined Motion Picture magazine to write a monthly gossip column. She became Parsons' assistant in 1935.         Miss Manners's 10-year marriage to Walter Ramsey ended in divorce. Her second marriage, to John Haskell, lasted 30 years, until his death in 1977.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Elizabeth Karlin, a Wisconsin doctor, advocate of women's rights and head of a clinic in Madison that was a target of abortion foes, died on July 27 at her home in nearby Arena. She was 54.         The cause was a brain tumor diagnosed a few months ago, her family said.         A native New Yorker, Dr. Karlin graduated from Bronx High School of Science and Antioch College. She received her medical degree at the University of Wisconsin and became an internist specializing in endocrinology.         She worked as a general practitioner in Tanzania before settling in Madison with a practice in internal medicine. She began to provide abortions in the 1980's even as more and more doctors refused to do so because of the actions of opponents.         Until her illness was diagnosed, she directed the Women's Medical Center on Madison's West Side. She was an outspoken champion of women's rights to self-determination.         ''I provide a full range of women's medical care and counseling to women who largely have no other access to health care,'' she wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Times in 1995, ''yet I am forced to wear a bulletproof vest, to outwit my harassers and to hire security to protect my clinic and staff. My job is to offer nurturing medical care to the women who least expect kindness, excellence or even cleanliness.''         Such caring and respect, she concluded, would actually serve to decrease the number of abortions in the country in the long run.         Dr. Karlin is survived by her daughter, Jessica Feierman of Philadelphia; a son, Joshua Feierman of New York City; and her mother, Rosa Karlin of Madison. Her marriage to Steven Feierman of Philadelphia ended in divorce.       
         Betty Carter, one of jazz's great singers and a composer and arranger whose groups were virtual schools for generations of jazz musicians, died at home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn on Saturday. She was 69.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her friend Ora Harris.         Ms. Carter sounded like no one in jazz, with her own diction, her own phrasing and her own sense of pitch. Though she was firmly inside the jazz-singing tradition, she was an abstractionist as well, and for her words were pliable. On her early material -- she began a solo recording career in the mid-1950's -- her light, pure voice sounded instrumental, with curved, beautifully shaped notes. It was immediately noticeable that she was after something different, and that her technique, always extraordinary, was there to work for her ideas. It was equally clear that she was a jazz musician first and a singer second.         About a decade after beginning her recording career, Ms. Carter refined her originality into a style that became the template for modern jazz singing. On ''Look No Further,'' recorded in 1964, Ms. Carter uses her voice against the bass, then as the band comes in her note choice mirrors the experimentation of instrumentalists like John Coltrane and Miles Davis; during the same session she recorded ''My Favorite Things,'' a composition associated with Mr. Coltrane. Her improvisations were explosive, tumbling out in great leaps at a velocity that expressed unfettered artistic freedom.         But it was artifice. Ms. Carter was one of jazz's most articulate small-group arrangers, and few musicians have ever controlled tempo the way  she had; woe to the young musicians in the band who could not navigate the shockingly abrupt tempo changes or keep up with Ms. Carter's fastest or slowest tempos. Her snapping fingers, marking off the time, sent generations of musicians back to the practice room, chagrined.         In her hands a standard or her own compositions often contrasted some of jazz's slowest tempos with some of its fastest. She wasn't afraid to pare down the instrumentation of a group for a while, singing against piano or bass, orchestrating the arrival of other instruments. And the constant tempo-changing gave the impression of emotional extremity and careful control of the artistic environment. She sculptured sound, and it made her concerts some of the most moving experiences in jazz, a mixture of the emotional power of the songs' texts and the sheer joy of her imagination.         ''I started to change my material to keep the musicians interested,'' Ms. Carter said in a 1992 interview with The New York Times. ''What do you do with a chorus and a half? You change things, stretch them out, change speed. Most musicians I played with were so good they could do what was necessary.''         Ms. Carter grew up in Detroit, which in the 1940's and 1950's was a good environment for jazz musicians, with the city producing some of the best musicians of the time.         Detroit was a stop on the jazz circuit, and a young Ms. Carter sang with Charlie Parker, who came through town. One of her nicknames was Betty Bebop, a tribute to her interests. In 1948 she began working with Lionel Hampton and his band, staying with the vibraphonist until 1951, when, during a performance in New York, she decided to remain there. During the same time she recorded the female part for King Pleasure's version of ''Red Top,'' singing a vocal rendition of Gail Brockman's original trumpet solo.         In New York in 1955 and '56, Ms. Carter began recording for Epic Records and generally taking in the  city. In 1957, she recorded with Wynton Kelly and other peers; her work was irregular partly because her style was more jazz than cabaret, and partly because she tried to avoid  the abusive working situations that have plagued jazz.         In 1961 Ms. Carter recorded what has become a classic album, ''Ray Charles and Betty Carter,'' with Mr. Charles; it features the pair singing astringent duets including a famous version of ''Baby, It's Cold Outside.'' Ms. Carter worked with Mr. Charles from 1960 to 1963, the year she toured Japan with Sonny Rollins and recorded an orchestral album for Atco Records.         Through the 1960's Ms. Carter struggled with her career, recording with Roulette Records in the late 1960's, during which the avant-garde and pop music rendered some artists identified with an older style commercially irrelevant. But in 1969 she started her own recording company, Bet-Car Productions, and on that label she released her albums.         In 1988 Ms. Carter began a relationship with Verve Records that included the reissue of the Bet-Car label along with the recording of a series of new albums. That same year she released ''Look What I Got!,'' which won a Grammy, and in 1994 she recorded an album, ''Feed the Fire,'' with the pianist Geri Allen, the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette.         Also during the 1980's Ms. Carter, finally recognized for her innovations, became a concert draw internationally. She recorded duets with Carmen McRae, and she kept turning out well-rounded musicians, having trained them in her trio. Included in the alumni from the 1980's and the 1990's were the pianists Cyrus Chestnut, Benny Green, Stephen Scott, Marc Cary, Darrell Grant and Travis Shook. And her choice of drummers was extraordinary, having hired Greg Hutchinson, Clarence Penn, Winard Harper, Troy Davis and Lewis Nash. She began receiving numerous awards, including the National Medal of Arts given last year by President Clinton.         In 1993 she began the Jazz Ahead series at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a program that featured young and promising musicians.  This year the Jazz Ahead series was invited to appear at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.         Ms. Carter is survived by two sons, Myles and Kagle Redding, both of New York City. A marriage to James Redding ended in divorce.         ''The survival of jazz culture takes priority,'' Ms. Carter said in the interview with The Times. ''The survival of this culture depends on people playing it and living the life. The young guys playing it in 20 years will be taking the music somewhere else. There was a period where, in jazz, the music sent people away. But it's now back to making people feel better, putting happy smiles on their faces. When I was coming up, that's what jazz was about. It wasn't about money. It was about how happy you could make people.''       
         Tania Long, a war correspondent for The New York Herald Tribune and The New York Times who covered the London blitz and the Nuremburg trials, died Friday morning at her home in Ottawa. She was 85.         After suffering from a series of illnesses, Ms. Long committed suicide, said Dr. Guy Genier, a coroner in Ottawa.         ''She was a woman of strong character, strong principles, dedicated to her work,'' said Joan Gordon, a friend of Ms. Long's in Ottawa. ''Her life had become painful to her because of illness.''         Born in Berlin on April 29, 1913, Ms. Long was the daughter of Russian-born Tatiana Mouraviev and Robert Crozier Long, a British journalist. Educated in Germany, France and England, Ms. Long studied economics, Russian literature and European history. She became an American citizen in 1935 and began her journalistic career a year later as a reporter for The Newark Ledger. She returned to Berlin in 1938 to work for The New York Herald Tribune, and joined The Tribune's London bureau in 1941. She was one of only a few women who were correspondents in World War II.         In London, she wrote of the city's poor during the blitz and of the bombing of the Hotel Savoy. ''I was sitting in my third-floor room ready to get into bed when I heard the bombs coming,'' she wrote. ''Only a split second later, the next bomb hit the cornice of the hotel and went off, and almost immediately after that the other one hit the rear of the building. When one hears bombs coming that close, there is not time to do anything. One hasn't time to be afraid; that comes later.''         During the war, Ms. Long married Raymond Daniell, the London bureau chief for The New York Times, and joined The Times as a reporter in February 1942. When Allied troops invaded Europe, Ms. Long, who continued to write under her maiden name, followed their advance, writing stories from liberated towns in France. She followed the Allied troops in Berlin, apparently the first female correspondent to do so.         Ms. Long and Mr. Daniell became a prominent husband-wife journalistic team, covering the Nuremberg trials and postwar Germany. Ms. Long spoke the language of all four occupying powers -- English, French and Russian -- as well as German.         From 1952 until 1964, she and her husband ran The Times's bureau in Ottawa, where they became prominent figures in Canada's political and journalistic circles. Honored upon their departure with a gala attended by the Canadian Prime Minister, the couple were hailed in The Ottawa Journal. The couple returned to Ottawa upon Mr. Daniell's retirement from The Times in 1967.         Ms. Long's 1932 marriage to Merwin Mallory Gray in Paris ended in divorce six years later. A son from that marriage, Robert M. Gray, died of cancer, said Sarah Jennings, a Canadian arts journalist and a family friend. Mr. Daniell also died of cancer, in 1969. In the 1970's, Ms. Long became the first publicist for the National Arts Center of Canada.         ''She was one of the breed of women that came out of the wartime era,'' said Ms. Jennings, ''most of whom were happily married and supportive of their husbands but in and of themselves were very strong-willed and independent.''       
         Pauline Julien, who sang songs of passion and of tender love, died on Wednesday in Montreal. The chanteuse, who was 70, was most strongly identified with the songs she sang in the cause of a separate and independent Quebec.         Ms. Julien took her own life at her home after leaving a note saying she did not want to be revived, said her sister, Fabienne Julien. She said the singer suffered from aphasia, a condition that severely limits the power to use or understand words, and had grown despondent as the disease progressed.         In a singing career that spanned more than 35 years and two continents, Ms. Julien became a beloved figure to French-speaking audiences who were touched by her stirring performances and forceful style. She recorded 22 albums containing more than 200 songs, including about 30 that she composed.         She popularized homespun Quebecois music in France and helped revive the popularity of sophisticated French music in Quebec. She interpreted the music of Kurt Weill and the Quebec composer Gilles Vigneault. One of her most popular songs was called ''Tonight I Feel Tender,'' a ballad that became a theme that she performed at many performances.         But from the time she first returned to Quebec from Paris in the late 1950's she formed part of the inspirational soul of the separatist movement in Quebec. She fell in love with the Quebecois poet and journalist Gerald Godin, a staunch separatist, and fought with him for Quebec separatism.         During a crisis in Quebec in 1970 when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sent the Canadian Army into the streets of Montreal in response to separatist violence, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were among a number of Quebecers who were swept off the streets and briefly jailed.         After Mr. Godin was elected to the province's assembly in 1976, the year the separatist party won control of the provincial government, she appeared regularly at major separatist rallies, leading huge crowds in song and fiery speeches.         She played a major role in fighting for women's rights and in obtaining the right to abortion in predominately Catholic Quebec.         ''Madame Julien lived intensely,'' said Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec. ''Her voice, the words of her songs -- above all on the question of love, friendship and her country -- her charisma and her passionate character are deeply etched in our collective memory.''         Ms. Julien was born in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, in 1928. She studied drama in Paris in the 1950's and  began singing there in bistros and bohemian clubs.         Jean Paul Goay, Ms. Julien's brother-in-law, said that on the night before she died she insisted on being taken to a show in Montreal where an old friend, the French comedian Raymond Davos, was performing. ''She told him then that they would never see each other again, but he didn't understand exactly what it signified,'' Mr. Goay said.         In the early 1990's, after 30 years of a common-law marriage, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were formally married. He died of a brain tumor in 1994.         In her later years Ms. Julien retired from active performing and traveled to Africa to work with the poor in Burkina Faso and other French-speaking countries.         She is survived by two children, Pascale and Nicolas, both of Montreal, from her first marriage to Jacques Galipeau, which ended in divorce.       
         Megs Jenkins, a British stage, film and television actress who specialized in playing kindly, matronly characters, died on Oct. 5, said a spokeswoman for the Gordon Rodwell Funeral Service in Felixstow, Suffolk, where her funeral was held. She was 81.         Miss Jenkins played many parts in her long career, but she was best known for her portrayal of nurses, governesses, maids, cooks, long-suffering wives and wise mothers. With her unglamorous looks and her plump, open face, she seemed made for sympathy and found herself typecast in supporting, or supportive, roles.         Born Muguette Mary Jenkins in Birkenhead, Cheshire, in 1917, Miss Jenkins harbored dreams of becoming a ballet dancer but turned to acting, and dispensed with her exotic first name, she said, when she realized that she did not have a dancer's physique.         ''It was sad, really,'' she once said. ''I was this same unsylphlike shape when I was 17. I had fancied I might call myself by my real name, Muguette, once I became a ballerina. But I had to face the fact that I was quite definitely a Megs.''         After studying at the School of Dancing and Dramatic Art in Liverpool, she took her first professional role, as a German hausfrau in ''The Lift That Failed,'' in a production by the Liverpool Repertory Company in 1933. She remained with the company for four years, then moved to London.         She had a long and distinguished stage career, veering several times from the roles in which she was typecast: she played a cruel, mentally unstable mother in Tennessee Williams's ''Summer and Smoke'' (1951), for instance, and the title role in Pinero's ''School Mistress'' (1954).         She was particularly praised for her role as a show-business fan in Emlyn Williams's ''Light of Heart'' (1940) and for her portrayal of the mother of a possible second messiah in a Welsh farming community during the Crimean War in another Emlyn Williams play, ''The Wind of Heaven'' (1945).         In 1956, she won the Clarence Derwent Award, then Britain's highest stage prize, for best supporting performance in Arthur Miller's ''View from the Bridge,'' in which she played a wife trying desperately to ignore her husband's incestuous feelings for his niece.         During World War II, she appeared in a number of patriotic movies intended to boost morale and support the war effort, including ''Millions Like Us'' (1943), about wartime factory workers, and ''The Lamp Still Burns,'' in which she played, not for the first or last time, a nurse.         She appeared in dozens of films, including ''The Brothers'' (1947), a strange melodrama set on the Isle of Skye; ''The Innocents'' (1961), a film based on Henry James's novella ''The Turn of the Screw,'' in which she played the nervous housemaid, and ''Indiscreet'' (1958), playing Ingrid Bergman's housekeeper.         Perhaps her most successful film was ''The History of Mr. Polly'' (1949), an adaption of H. G. Wells's comic novel, in which she seemed perfectly cast as a homey, dependable landlady.         Her television work included a role in the popular series ''All Creatures Great and Small,'' based on the James Herriot books, and a part in the comedy series ''Young at Heart,'' in which she played a bickering retiree opposite John Mills, who had been her co-star in ''The History of Mr. Polly.''         Miss Jenkins's 1943 marriage to George Routledge, a commando who had been a childhood classmate, and who renewed their acquaintance when he saw her name in a review, ended in divorce in 1959.       
         Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, the grande dame of sex education, died yesterday at the Kendal at Longwood nursing home in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 94 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last decade.         Indefatigable and fired by a zeal for sexual responsibility and realism, Dr. Calderone persuaded a recalcitrant American Medical Association to let doctors dispense birth control as a matter of course to their patients, and she set in motion the means of educating schoolchildren about human sexuality.         Dr. Calderone did more than any other individual to convince both the medical profession and the public that human sexuality goes far beyond the sex act. She heralded it as a multifaceted and vital part of a healthy life that should not be hidden under a shroud of secrecy or limited to erotic expression.         One of her favorite challenges to young audiences she addressed was to ask for a four-letter word ending in ''k'' that meant sexual intercourse. Over a chorus of titters, she would give her answer: ''talk.'' Then she would explain, ''We never talk to each other as nonsexual people.''         Dr. Calderone, the daughter of the photographer Edward Steichen, was a woman of many talents and diverse interests who did not find her true calling until midlife. Following graduation from Vassar College, where she majored in chemistry, she decided to go on the stage, but abandoned her acting career when she realized she could never be as good as Katherine Cornell.         At the age of 30, after a failed marriage to a fellow actor, W. Lon Martin, and the birth of two daughters, Nell and Linda, she decided to go to medical school.         She received an M.D. degree in 1939 from the University of Rochester and a master's degree in public health in 1942 from the Columbia University School of Public Health. While at Columbia she met Dr. Frank Calderone, then a district health officer on the Lower East Side who would soon become deputy commissioner of health for New York City and her second husband. The couple was married in 1941.         Dr. Calderone served for some years as a school physician in Great Neck, L.I. In 1953 she became medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, where she carried forward Margaret Sanger's mission for family planning.         In 1964 Dr. Calderone realized one of her crowning goals: she convinced the trustees of the American Medical Association that the nation's leading organization of physicians should disseminate information on reproduction and birth control and endorse the prescription of birth control measures to all patients who needed them. The trustees' proposal was adopted, helping to move birth control into the mainstream of American medicine.         Three years earlier, as a representative of family planning, she took part in the first American Conference on Church and Family run by the National Council of Churches. Attended by sociologists, religious leaders, educators and public health professionals, the conference highlighted the suffering of thousands of people because of ignorance about frigidity, impotence, homosexuality and contraception.         With five colleagues at the conference, Dr. Calderone set up an informal committee to study human sexuality. Out of that committee grew Dr. Calderone's signature achievement, the co-founding of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States in 1964. Dr. Calderone then resigned from Planned Parenthood to turn her attention from reproductive biology to education in human sexuality.         Better known by its acronym Siecus, the council was created to help teachers, therapists and other professionals establish human sexuality as an integral part of health and health education. Under her guidance, Siecus became the moving force for education about human sexuality in the schools as well as in the community. The organization publishes ''Guidelines for Sexuality Education: Kindergarten through 12th Grade'' and helps schools around the country set up comprehensive sex education programs.         As the president of Siecus, Dr. Calderone stood out in the 1960's as an innovator, one of a handful of educators, scientists and philosophers who were beginning to address the big topics of human existence like death and sexuality. She was an unstinting advocate for the acceptance of masturbation as a wholesome, normal and almost universal practice for people of all ages.         Dr. Calderone was far more than a female doctor championing a cause. Her theatrical training, coupled with her carriage, poise and authoritative voice, helped her to get her message across that children are born sexual beings and remain so until they die and that people of all ages need and deserve a proper sexual education.         Dr. Calderone believed sex education in the schools should start in kindergarten, and under her direction Siecus helped to set up sex education programs in thousands of schools throughout the country. After stepping down from the presidency, she joined New York University as an adjunct professor in its program on human sexuality. She was active professionally until age 80.         Almost from birth, Mary Steichen was a natural leader: optimistic, determined, resilient and forthright, who from early childhood knew how to speak her mind. At age 6, for example, she criticized the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, a family friend, for creating ''L'Oiseau d'Or'' with a horizontal head, a position that she said would make it impossible for the bird to sing. Brancusi's later bird sculptures had more uplifted heads.         Her imposing appearance combined with her strong personality helped her advance her causes and also to defend them against attacks by groups like the Christian Crusade, the John Birch Society and Moral Majority, who contended that her promotion of sex education in schools was encouraging a premature and unhealthy participation in sexual experience and usurping the role of parents in guiding their children's lives. Her reply was that if parents were doing their job properly there would be no need for school-based sex education.         A devout Quaker and a Republican, she was once labeled by the John Birch Society as an ''aging sexual libertine.'' She reminded her critics that modern children were in desperate need of sex education because they were sexually vulnerable: ''devoid of chaperones, supervision, rules and close family relations and subject to onslaughts of commercial sexual exploitation.''         But recognizing that a child's sexual attitudes are often shaped before school age, Dr. Calderone also focused on educating parents. Through Siecus she established Parent Learning Centers to teach adults about their own sexuality as well as their children's.         In 1981 she and Eric Johnson wrote a widely praised book, ''The Family Book About Sexuality,'' which was published in five languages. The following year, she and James W. Ramey were the co-authors of ''Talking With Your Child About Sex,'' published in four languages.         Dr. Calderone also contributed to many professional publications and served as editor of texts on abortion and family planning.         Though Dr. Calderone saw serendipity as a major architect of her success, she did not always lead a charmed life. She grew up as the daughter of a working artist. Her mother, Clara, was considered cold, and their relationship adversarial.         When her parents divorced, Mary, then 10, chose to live with her father. Not until nearly seven decades after the divorce was she able to bury the emotional hatchet that had estranged her from her mother.         Dr. Calderone's own experiences as a mother were also difficult. Her 8-year-old daughter, Nell, died of pneumonia, plunging her into a debilitating depression.         Her marriage to Dr. Calderone, who later became chief administrative officer of the World Health Organization, produced two more daughters, Dr. Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist, and Dr. Maria Calderone, a veterinarian in Galena, Ohio, born almost 20 years after her oldest daughter, Linda Hodes, a psychotherapist in Albuquerque, N.M.         The Calderones separated in 1979 but never divorced. Dr. Frank Calderone died in 1987.         In addition to her daughters, Mary Calderone is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 10, 1998, Tuesday  An obituary on Oct. 25 about Dr. Mary S. Calderone, who battled political and religious groups to take sex education to schools, misstated her political affiliation. She was a Democrat, not a Republican. The list of survivors also misidentified the public health degree held by a daughter, Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist. It is a master's, not a doctorate.       
         Alicia Parla, a sinuous Cuban-born beauty who had a brief but incandescent run as the international Queen of the Rumba, died of cancer on Tuesday at her home in Miami. She was 84 and was recalled as the teen-age sensation who became the toast of New York and Paris, captivated crowned heads of Europe and taught the rumba to the Prince of Wales, Josephine Baker and a generation of Depression-weary revelers.         O.K., it wasn't the rumba. As purists never tire of pointing out, the dance by that name that swept America and Europe in the 1930's and became an Arthur Murray staple was such a tame, watered-down version of the Afro-Cuban original that it was closer to a dance the Cubans call the son.         Never mind. The authentic street rumba of Havana, whose extravagant, explicit gestures seem more suggestive of mating than of a mating dance, is not something one would have actually wanted to do on a dance floor before the 1980's, or ever on stage.         Whatever its pedigree, in Miss Parla's hands, or rather hips, the dance the world came to know as the rumba was such an appealing sight that she and it became overnight sensations.         For Miss Parla, at least, it took some doing. A native of Havana, where her father was a prominent doctor, she attended a convent school in Key West, Fla., then moved to New York with her mother during a period of political instability in Cuba in the 1920's.         Fortunately, as she pointed out in a 1995 interview with John Dorschner of The Miami Herald, her father, a man so strict that he would never have countenanced dancing as a career, stayed behind in Havana.         Not that her mother was not strict, too. From the time she was 9, Miss Parla recalled, her mother warned her almost daily that if she did not remain a virgin she would never find a man to marry her.         It was advice that Miss Parla seems to have taken to heart, in part, perhaps, because her admitted teen-age ambition was to marry a millionaire.         Her father had other ideas, insisting that his daughter obtain a measure of self-sufficiency by learning to type, ''until a millionaire comes along, as he put it.''         A dutiful daughter, Miss Parla obliged, but since she was a little girl her real passion had been dancing, and when a man who ran a dance studio in her apartment building marveled at her skill, she began to get the notion that she might actually become a professional.         She got her chance in 1931 after she began working as a 17-year-old cigarette girl at a Greenwich Village nightclub, a job she was able to take over her mother's objections only after promising never to let her father know, agreeing to let her mother serve as on-the-job chaperone and threatening suicide, something Miss Parla did with alarming regularity throughout her life.         Then came the inevitable night that the club's Spanish dancer became ill. Miss Parla volunteered to take her place, and, well, she was such a hit and gained such confidence that when the celebrated Cuban band leader Don Azpiazu issued a call for a rumba dancer for a gig at the Paramount a few weeks later, Miss Parla tried out, along with 150 other hopefuls, and got the job.         During rehearsals she was paired with a man, but she found him so clumsy and the whole experience so embarrassing that she persuaded Mr. Azpiazu to let her dance alone, as she did from then on. ''The rumba is very sexual,'' she explained, ''and I didn't like doing it with a partner.''         The decision may well have been crucial in allowing the rumba's eventual acceptance by a puritanical world, since for all Miss Parla's sensuous gyrations, the sight of a woman dancing alone was simply not as sexually suggestive as a couple dancing together.         It was the Paramount engagement that helped make the Azpiazu recording of ''El Manisero'' (''The Peanut Vendor'') a national hit and the foundation of the rumba craze of the 1930's.         After touring the United States with the Azpiazu orchestra (a musician's wife serving as her chaperone), then dancing with another orchestra at the Tavern on the Green in Central Park, Miss Parla (and her mother) joined Mr. Azpiazu for a European tour in 1932.         It was during an engagement in Monte Carlo that Miss Parla caught the eye of two future kings of England, Edward, the Prince of Wales, and his brother Albert, the Duke of York, who later became King George VI. The next day Edward summoned Miss Parla to his villa to teach him the rumba, as she did (with her mother tagging along). ''He got it,'' she said. ''He was very good.''         When another of her Monte Carlo conquests, Maurice Chevalier, asked her to go to Nice with him for the night, Miss Parla declined, saying, as she recalled, ''Oh, Mr. Chevalier, I'm so sorry. I'm a virgin.''         For all her triumph in Monte Carlo, Miss Parla was hardly prepared for what happened when she opened in Paris that July. When she made her entrance walking down a grand staircase wearing a slave scarf and a costume decorated in red, white and blue, the colors of the Cuban flag, the crowd went wild, she recalled, and began shouting ''Vive La France.''         Miss Parla later learned that it was Bastille Day and that the crowd had taken it as a tribute to France when she appeared wearing the colors of the French flag. The next day,  she was hailed by critics as ''the Cuban Mariana,'' (the French Uncle Sam, she was told) and the name stuck. Within weeks, ''Mariana scarfs,'' copied from her costume, were on sale in chic French shops, Miss Parla had taught Josephine Baker to rumba and had made a side trip to Brussels, where King Leopold was so enchanted he gave her a box of chocolates so big she danced on it for him.         After a triumphant return to the United States aboard the Ile de France in 1933, Miss Parla spent a year dancing at Mon Paris nightclub, where she was hailed by Walter Winchell as ''that lovely Havana torso flipper.'' Finally bowing to her father's wishes, she returned to Havana at the end of 1934 and married a few months later. She was not yet 21, but her reign as the Queen of the Rumba was over.         After her first husband, the playboy son of a wealthy rancher, discovered he couldn't keep her down on the finca after she'd seen Paree, Miss Parla obtained a divorce and later married Guillermo Amuchastegui, a celebrated jai alai player who took her all over the world, and she hobnobbed with the likes of Orson Welles and Esther Williams (when she wasn't in Cuba hobnobbing with Ernest Hemingway).         When Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Miss Parla, by then married to a Batista government official, fled to the United States and settled in Miami. To make ends meet the former Queen of the Rumba, her father's daughter to the end, spent 20 years working as a typist.         Miss Parla is survived by a daughter, Ileana Comas, and a sister, Zilia Navarete, both of Miami, and two grandsons.       
         Kyra Nijinsky, a dancer who was the daughter of Vaslav Nijinsky, one of this century's greatest ballet dancers and choreographers, died on Sept. 1 at the Pine Ridge Care Center in San Rafael, Calif. She led a reclusive life in San Francisco and details of her death became nationally known only recently. She was 84.         Miss Nijinsky identified artistically with her celebrated father, whose career was curtailed by mental illness. With her high cheekbones and muscular physique, she even resembled him. During the 1930's, she sometimes attended ballet classes dressed like the male students in white shirt and tights rather than in the tunics women then favored.         Born in Vienna, she spent her childhood on tour with her parents and at a school in Switzerland. She received early dance training from her aunt, the choreographer Bronislava Nijinska, and at the Paris Opera Ballet School.         Never long associated with any company, Miss Nijinsky attracted special attention in London in the 1930's. She impersonated her father in ''Le Spectre de la Rose,'' one of his greatest roles, in ''Streamline'' a sophisticated revue of 1934. She then went into the Ballet Rambert, where her parts included that of a nymph in a revival of her father's ''Apres-Midi d'un Faune.''         In 1934 she also created her most important role for the Rambert troupe in Antony Tudor's astrological fantasy, ''The Planets.'' As the Mortal Born Under Neptune, she portrayed a mystical longing to unite with the infinite. Although admitting that Miss Nijinsky was not a strong technician, the British critic Arnold Haskell called her ''a dancer who understands, whether instinctively or otherwise, how to use dancing to express her emotions.''         Miss Nijinsky's stage career began fading after she married the conductor Igor Markevitch in 1936; the marriage ended in divorce and Markevitch, who died in 1983, raised their son, Vaslav Nijinsky Markevitch.         While living in Italy during World War II, Miss Nijinsky was briefly imprisoned by the Nazis, who accused her of spying. After the war, she worked as an interpreter and managed a boutique.         Moving to San Francisco in 1954, she became a painter and poet. Deeply religious, she devoted herself to the expression of spiritual themes.         She is survived by her son; a sister, Tamara Nijinsky of Phoenix, and four grandchildren.       
         Kyra Nijinsky, a dancer who was the daughter of Vaslav Nijinsky, one of this century's greatest ballet dancers and choreographers, died on Sept. 1 at the Pine Ridge Care Center in San Rafael, Calif. She led a reclusive life in San Francisco and details of her death become nationally known only recently. She was 84.         Miss Nijinsky identified artistically with her celebrated father, whose career was curtailed by mental illness. With her high cheekbones and muscular physique, she even resembled him. During the 1930's, she sometimes attended ballet classes dressed like the male students in white shirt and tights rather than in the tunics women then favored.         Born in Vienna, she spent her childhood on tour with her parents and at a school in Switzerland. She received early dance training from her aunt, the choreographer Bronislava Nijinska, and at the Paris Opera Ballet School.         Never long associated with any company, Miss Nijinsky attracted special attention in London in the 1930's. She impersonated her father in ''Le Spectre de la Rose,'' one of his greatest roles, in ''Streamline'' a sophisticated revue of 1934. She then went into the Ballet Rambert, where her parts included that of a nymph in a revival of her father's ''Apres-Midi d'un Faune.''         In 1934 she also created her most important role for the Rambert troupe in Antony Tudor's astrological fantasy, ''The Planets.'' As the Mortal Born Under Neptune, she portrayed a mystical longing to unite  with the infinite.

         Valerie Hobson, a British movie star who stayed loyal to her husband, John Profumo, after he figured in a sex scandal as a member of Britain's Conservative Government in 1963, died on Friday at a London hospital. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, the British news agency Press Association said.         Miss Hobson, a British naval officer's daughter, starred in British films of the 1930's and 1940's. As the movie historian Ephraim Katz has put it, ''she developed into one of the prime leading ladies of the British screen, gentle, graceful and elegant, the personification of the well-bred upper-crust English lady.''         She retired as an actress after starring as the governess, Anna, in the 1953 stage production of the musical ''The King and I'' in London. That role, The Daily Telegraph said on Saturday, was her greatest success, and ''as an actress, she knew, like Garbo, when to quit.''         The British critic W. A. Darlington wrote in The New York Times that in the musical her singing voice ''was true and clear'' and ''besides the great good looks which had taken her on to movies, she proved to have a warm and charming personality.''         Earlier she starred as Estella in David Lean's ''Great Expectations'' (1946), which the critic Leonard Maltin has called ''one of the greatest films ever made, a vivid adaptation of Dickens's tale of a mysterious benefactor making a poor young orphan a gentleman of means.''         Another of her best-remembered film roles was her starring part, with Alec Guinness, in the much-applauded black comedy ''Kind Hearts and Coronets'' (1949).         In 1954 she married Mr. Profumo, a Conservative member of Parliament. He stepped down in disgrace as Secretary of State for War in 1963 after it had become known that he was having an affair with a British call girl, Christine Keeler, who was also involved with a Soviet military attache.         Later Mr. Profumo did much to redeem himself by throwing himself into unpaid charity work. Miss Hobson also did volunteer work, for a leprosy relief organization and for children with mental handicaps. In 1975 she and her husband went to Buckingham Palace, where he was honored for his good works by being made a Commander, Order of the British Empire.         The 1963 scandal became the basis for the 1989 film ''Scandal'' -- which,  the critic Vincent Canby of The New York Times wrote, ''so abridges and elides the real-life case that it isn't easy for a nonstudent to follow the chronology of events.''         Born in Larne in Northern Ireland, Miss Hobson went on to attend the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. She began her performing career on the London stage, acted in some modest British films, then made some Hollywood movies for Universal -- largely forgettable, except for ''The Bride of Frankenstein,'' where she played the baron's wife -- and returned to Britain in the mid-1930's.         Her 1939 marriage to Sir Anthony Havelock-Allan, a baronet who had produced several movies she was in, ended in divorce in 1952.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, Mark Havelock-Allan and David Profumo.       
         Esther Rolle, a pioneering African-American actress who gained national recognition in the 1970's for her role as Florida Evans on two television shows, first ''Maude'' and then ''Good Times,'' died at a hospital here on Tuesday. She was 78 and lived in Los Angeles.         Larry Calhoun, her longtime publicist, said the cause of death had not been determined, but he added that Ms. Rolle had been suffering from diabetes and had been under dialysis. He said she had celebrated her 78th birthday a little more than a week ago, and that one of the last things she had done was to write a check to support a local black theater, something she had done most of her career.         Ms. Rolle met with many of her old friends and cast members of the two television shows just last week in a gathering here for a People magazine article.         Norman Lear, one of the executive producers of both of her shows, said the once-stocky actress appeared thin but vibrant, and that she had a role in a forthcoming movie, ''Down in the Delta,'' directed by the poet Maya Angelou and scheduled for release this month.         Ms. Rolle became famous for playing the role of a strong-willed maid on television, and in that role she also performed memorably in the play ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' in the television movie ''Summer of My German Soldier,'' for which she won an Emmy award in 1979, and in the movie ''Driving Miss Daisy.'' She also appeared in the film ''Rosewood.''         But she spoke firmly and often about about her desire to fight black stereotypes on television and even left the cast of ''Good Times'' for a while, saying at the time that she resented the image presented by the buffoonish character of her son in the show. In the show she played the matriarch of a struggling black family in Chicago.         Ms. Rolle was well known for her strong personality, both on and off screen, and her ear for the nuances of race relations. Mr. Lear, who was the executive producer of ''All in the Family,'' from which ''Maude'' and ''Good Times'' were later spun off, said one of his most vivid memories of Ms. Rolle was a musical number she performed with Beatrice Arthur, the actress who played Maude.         Mr. Lear said that every year there was a musical number on the show, and one season Ms. Rolle and Ms. Arthur performed ''Me and My Shadow.'' Ms. Arthur kept trying to stand in back and play the shadow in the scene, but Ms. Rolle kept slipping behind her, a striking metaphor for the subtleties of race relations that Mr. Lear described as ''an indelible memory of an indelible woman.''         Ms. Rolle was born in Pompano Beach, Fla., a retirement community that was once a bucolic farming town with the character of the deep South. She was the 10th of 18 children and her father was a farmer.         She had a theatrical bent and after high school followed her sister, Rosanna Carter, also an actress, to New York. She was one of the early members of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York and in the late 1950's performed with Shologa Oloba, an African-American dance troupe. In 1958 she and her sister appeared with the company in a revival of Asadata Dafora's ''Zunguru.''         In 1990 she became the first woman to receive the N.A.A.C.P. Chairman's Civil Rights Leadership Award for her work improving the image of blacks.         Ms. Rolle's marriage ended in divorce and she had no children, her publicist said. She is survived by two sisters and a brother.       
         Svetlana Beriosova, an incandescent leading ballerina with the Royal Ballet of England for two decades, died on Tuesday at the hospice at St. Charles's Hospital in London. She was 66 and lived in London.         The cause was cancer, said Patricia Daly of the British journal Dancing Times.         A taste of caviar in the sumptuous banquet of English ballet dancing of the 1950's and 60's, Ms. Beriosova embodied pure classicism shot through with quietly shimmering mystery. A dancer of almost subliminal contradictions, she was a regal ballerina who projected a warmth that was poignant in its unexpectedness. She was an introverted dancer who could be funny, though she was seldom called upon to be. She was reticent yet eloquent, moving with a Russian ballet amplitude but none of the typical Russian fireworks.         In her greatest roles, among them Odette, the swan queen in ''Swan Lake,'' Aurora in ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' the title role in ''Giselle'' and the wife of Edward Elgar in Frederick Ashton's 1968 ''Enigma Variations,'' Ms. Beriosova was exquisitely lyrical yet possessed of an innate grandeur.         The English dance writer Katherine Sorley Walker, writing this year in Dance Now, praised Ms. Beriosova for her ''poise and serenity, her unhurried perfection of line.'' Early in Ms. Beriosova's career, the dance writer Annabel Farjeon described the ballerina as ''one of those rare beings -- the natural dancer,'' adding that ''no amount of training can give this inborn beauty to every pose.'' A. H. Franks wrote of Ms. Beriosova's fluency, of arabesques and attitudes that ''became movement in suspension rather than a cessation of movement.''         Ms. Beriosova was born in Kaunas, Lithuania, where her father, the dancer and ballet master Nicholas Beriozoff, worked at the Lithuanian State Opera. Ms. Beriosova was a very young witness to the development of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, where her father danced in the 1930's and where she saw the work of some of the great emigre Russian dancers and choreographers of the time. She trained in ballet first with her mother, who died when she was 10, and then with the noted Russian teachers Anatole Vilzak and Ludmila Shollar in New York City, where the family moved in 1940.         Ms. Beriosova performed in children's roles with the Ballet Russe and at 15 became an apprentice with the Marquis de Cuevas's Grand Ballet de Monte Carlo. She joined the Metropolitan Ballet in London in 1947, at 15, and despite her inexperience quickly impressed the director, Cecilia Blatch. ''Well, she isn't quite what we need at the moment,'' the director is said to have commented,  ''but in a few months she'll be what everyone needs.''         While still a teen-ager, Ms. Beriosova was given major roles in classical and contemporary ballets. She joined the second company of the Sadler's Wells Ballet (later Royal Ballet) in 1950, moving on to the first company two years later. She danced with the troupe until 1975, when she retired from the stage.         Ms. Beriosova never quite became the star that many expected her to be. She lacked self-confidence and had the misfortune to be cast, into the early 1960's, in a string of unpopular second-rate works by leading choreographers. ''She seemed to lack the toughness that can allow an artist to express herself to the full in spite of unhelpful circumstances and depressing setbacks,'' Ms. Walker wrote in Dance Now.         But Ms. Beriosova seldom failed to make a strong impression in Europe and abroad particularly in the United States, sometimes in small roles that she quietly made her own, like the Tsarevna in ''The Firebird.'' In 1961, she charmed audiences in the title role of Ashton's unsuccessful ''Persephone.'' Her other notable roles included the Bride in Bronislava Nijinska's version of ''Les Noces,'' the Tsarina in Kenneth MacMillan's ''Anastasia,'' the lead female characters in ''Coppelia'' and ''Sylvia.''         Ms. Beriosova also danced the title roles in Ashton's ''Cinderella'' and ''Ondine'' and lead roles in Ashton's ''Birthday Offering'' and a wide range of other ballets by Ashton and MacMillan and by choreographers including Andree Howard, John Cranko and George Balanchine.         Plagued by illness and injuries, Ms. Beriosova performed very little in the 1970's. On her retirement from dancing, she became a popular teacher and dancers' coach, working in public onstage in Maina Gielgud's ''Steps, Notes and Squeaks'' in 1978 and 1980.         Ms. Beriosova's marriage to Mohammed Masud Khan ended in divorce in 1974.         She is survived by her stepmother, Doris Beriozoff of Zurich.       
         Irene Hervey, who secured her place as one of Hollywood's most beautiful leading ladies after playing Jimmy Stewart's love interest in the 1939 western ''Destry Rides Again,'' died on Sunday at the hospital of the Motion Picture and Television Fund in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 89 and lived in Los Angeles.         With her wide-eyed, dimpled good looks, Miss Hervey, who was born in Venice, Calif., became a contract player at MGM in 1933, where she played featured roles in movies and short subjects until she became a freelance actress in the mid-1930's.         She then joined Universal Pictures from 1938 to 1943, where she appeared in ''Destry Rides Again'' with Stewart and Marlene Dietrich.         In her prime, Miss Hervey appeared with some of Hollywood's major names, including Bing Crosby in ''East Side of Heaven,'' Lionel Barrymore in ''The Stranger's Return,'' Alan Ladd in ''Chicago Deadline,'' Raymond Burr in ''A Cry in the Night,'' Burgess Meredith in ''San Francisco Docks'' and William Powell in ''Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid.''         Miss Hervey also had roles in the films ''The Count of Monte Cristo,'' ''Frisco Lil,'' ''Cactus Flower'' and ''Play Misty for Me.'' She starred in the Broadway production and national company of ''State of the Union'' in the late 1940's.         She moved into television, appearing in such popular series as ''Family Affair,'' ''Twilight Zone,'' ''Perry Mason,'' ''The Wide Country,''  ''Richard Diamond, Private Detective'' and ''Charlie's Angels.'' She starred as Aunt Meg in the hit series ''Honey West'' with Anne Francis and received an Emmy nomination for a guest appearance on ''My Three Sons.''         Miss Hervey's marriage to the actor Allan Jones ended in divorce in 1957. She is survived by a daughter, Gail Christensen of Los Angeles, and a son, Jack Jones of Indian Wells, Calif.       
         Honoria Murphy Donnelly, the daughter of Gerald and Sara Murphy, the golden couple at the center of the modernist whirl in 1920's Europe, who was dandled on the knees of the towering figures of the avant-garde, died on Tuesday at the Hospice of Palm Beach in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 81 and lived in Palm Beach Shores and East Hampton, N.Y.         The cause was liver cancer, said Amanda Vaill, the author of ''Everybody Was So Young: Gerald and Sara Murphy -- A Lost Generation Love Story'' (Houghton Mifflin).         Mrs. Donnelly, the eldest of the Murphys' three children and the only one to reach adulthood, published a biography of her parents, ''Sara & Gerald: Villa America and After'' (Times Books) written with Richard N. Billings, in 1982.         Attractive, cultured and well-to-do (Gerald was heir to the Mark Cross leather goods fortune, Sara the daughter of an industrialist and a grandniece of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman), the Murphys epitomized the urbane insouciance of the jazz age. Although Gerald enjoyed a brief career as a painter -- his small output remains well regarded -- he and his wife were content to occupy backstage roles as bartenders, muses and sometime financial angels to the foremost writers, composers and artists of their age.         In return, the Murphys were memorialized (not always graciously) in the work they supported. They were the inspiration for Dick and Nicole Diver in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel ''Tender is the Night''; Sara was the model for Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' and Fitzgerald bestowed the name Honoria on the heroine of his 1931 story ''Babylon Revisited.''         Honoria Adeline Murphy (she pronounced the 'H' in her first name) was born in New York on Dec. 19, 1917. Fair haired and blue eyed, she ''looked like a Renoir and was dressed accordingly,'' in the words of the Murphy biographer Calvin Tomkins.         In 1921, partly to escape the philistinism of American culture, the Murphys sailed for Europe with Honoria and her younger brothers, Baoth and Patrick. In Paris they painted scenery for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, which gave them entree to a circle that included Picasso and Jean Cocteau.         In the summer of 1925 the family moved to Antibes, on the Riviera, then an unheard-of destination in warm weather. (The Murphys are credited with starting the Riviera's summer season.) They christened their house Villa America.         At Villa America, they moved in a shimmering bubble that seemed to insulate them from ordinary cares. The late 20's passed there in a charmed blur of jazz and Champagne and beaded dresses, of spats and white flannels and sherry and biscuits on the seashore. A representative guest list: Picasso, Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Archibald MacLeish, Philip Barry, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, Cole Porter, Monty Woolley, Igor Stravinsky, Fernand Leger and Ernest and consecutive Mrs. Hemingways.         To Honoria and her brothers, these artistic titans were simply the adored tall people of their enchanted childhood. Hemingway taught her to catch and gut fish. (She got off easy: he once tried to teach her father to bullfight.) The photographs in the family album were by Man Ray. Scrutinizing one of Honoria's drawings hung on the Villa America terrace (nicknamed ''Les Salons de Jeunesse''), Picasso counseled, ''Don't change it.''         As a young woman, she studied French theater history with Mrs. Darius Milhaud and acting with Mrs. Patrick Campbell. She later performed with the French Theater of New York and worked as a secretary for Theater Inc., a producing organization. In recent years, she lectured on the Lost Generation writers and opened her vast archive of family memorabilia to scholars of the period.         In 1929 the real world intruded savagely on the Murphys' idyll when their youngest son, Patrick, was found to have tuberculosis. They returned to the United States, where Honoria attended Rosemary Hall School in Greenwich, Conn., and the Spence School in New York, from which she graduated in 1937.         It was Baoth who died first, in 1935, after contracting spinal meningitis at 15. ''Only the invented part of our life -- the unreal part -- has had any scheme, any beauty,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to Fitzgerald. ''Life itself has stepped in now and blundered, scarred and destroyed.''         Two years later Patrick died at 16. Fitzgerald wrote to the Murphys: ''For a long, long time you will be inconsolable. But I can see another generation growing up around Honoria and an eventual peace somewhere.''         A devoted daughter who was ever conscious of her responsibility as the sole surviving child, Honoria fulfilled that prophecy. After an early marriage that ended in divorce, she wed William M. Donnelly, a businessman, in 1950. (On their honeymoon, she telephoned her parents every night.) The couple lived in Carmel, Calif., and later in McLean, Va. Mrs. Donnelly, who was widowed in 1988, is survived by their children, John, of Palm Beach Shores; Sherman, of Key Biscayne, Fla., and Laura, of East Hampton, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         ''How different a dawn than the one we saw in a hospital 18 years ago,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to Sara after the Donnellys' second son was born. ''Two boys went out from our family, and now two other boys have come into it.''
