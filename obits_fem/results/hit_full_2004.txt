         Doris Troy, the big-voiced soul singer of the 1963 hit ''Just One Look,'' whose life story was the inspiration for the long-running musical ''Mama, I Want to Sing,'' died on Monday in a hospital in Las Vegas. She was 67 and lived in Las Vegas.         The cause was emphysema, said Ken Wydro, her brother-in-law.         Ms. Troy's career bridged gospel, soul and rock music. After singing in the choir of her father's church in Harlem, she began working as a backup singer for Solomon Burke, the Drifters, Chuck Jackson and others. She also wrote her own songs, and one of her first, ''Just One Look,'' released by Atlantic and written with Gregory Carroll, became a Top 10 hit in 1963. The next year the Hollies' version of it reached No. 2 in the British pop charts, and it was later recorded by Linda Ronstadt, Harry Nilsson and Bryan Ferry.         Ms. Troy's other songs for Atlantic during this period -- including ''What'cha Gonna Do About It?,'' also recorded by the Hollies -- had more success in Britain than in America, and in the late 60's she moved to London. She recorded an album for the Beatles' Apple label in 1970 with a starry group of musicians from the rock world that included George Harrison, Eric Clapton and Billy Preston.         She became a much sought after backup singer for rock bands: her voice is on the Rolling Stones' 1969 song ''You Can't Always Get What You Want'' and Pink Floyd's 1973 album ''Dark Side of the Moon,'' among many other recordings. She returned to the United States in the 1970's and settled in Las Vegas, singing in the nightclubs there.         In March 1983, ''Mama, I Want to Sing,'' a musical based on Ms. Troy's life, opened at the Heckscher Theater in Harlem. Written by Ms. Troy's younger sister Vy Higginsen and Mr. Wydro, who is Ms. Higginsen's husband, the show told the story of a young woman named Doris Winter who sings in a gospel choir and becomes an international pop star.         The next year Time magazine called it one of New York's 10 best stage offerings, and it has had an extraordinarily long life on tour. Ms. Troy sang the role of her mother, Geraldine, from early 1984 until 1998, toured with it throughout the country and took it to London and Japan. The show is to begin a 20th-anniversary run on Saturday at the Williams C. M. E. Church on Adam Clayton Powell Boulevard in Harlem.         Born Doris Higginson, Ms. Troy took her name from Helen of Troy; for her songwriting credits she used the surname Payne, after her maternal grandmother.         In addition to her sister Vy, of Manhattan, Ms. Troy is survived by another sister, Joyce Davis, of Fort Lee, N.J.       
         Estelle Stewart Axton, whose name put the ''Ax'' in Stax Records, the Memphis soul label she founded with her brother, died on Tuesday in Memphis. She was 85.         She died at the St. Francis Nursing Home after a series of strokes, said Deanie Parker, the president and chief executive of Soulsville, the nonprofit corporation that runs the Stax Museum of American Soul Music and the Stax Music Academy.         In the heyday of 1960's and 70's soul, Stax released hits by Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Wilson Pickett, Isaac Hayes, Rufus Thomas and the Staple Singers, among many others. It was the second-best-selling soul label of its era, behind Motown Records.         The Stax studio, in the former Capitol movie theater in Memphis, attracted young singers and songwriters, and was an integrated business in a largely segregated city. Ms. Axton and her brother, James Stewart, founders of the label, were white; most of their hitmakers were black; and the label's studio band, Booker T. and the MG's, was mixed. ''We never looked at color; we looked at people,'' Ms. Axton said last year.         Stax got started as Satellite Records in 1957, when Mr. Stewart, a country fiddler who worked at a bank, began recording country songs in his wife's uncle's garage, but soon switched to rhythm-and-blues. His eldest sister, Estelle Stewart, who had married Everett Axton in 1941, became Mr. Stewart's partner in 1958 when she took out a second mortgage on her home to buy recording equipment. In 1960 they leased the abandoned theater, in a mixed neighborhood that was fast becoming an African-American ghetto, and made it the company's offices and recording studio.         To generate income they installed a record store at the theater's old candy counter. The shop, Satellite Records, drew teenagers and became a place to recruit talent and a test market for their new releases. The first singers to record at the studio were Rufus Thomas and Carla Thomas, father and daughter, and their rhythm-and-blues song ''Cause I Love You'' became the label's first regional hit, followed by Carla Thomas's ''Gee Whiz.''         The label's third hit, ''Last Night,'' was an instrumental by the Mar-Keys, a group including Ms. Axton's son, Charles (nicknamed Packy) Axton, on saxophone. After ''Last Night'' was released, a Satellite Records label in California noticed the company. Mr. Stewart and Ms. Axton changed their label's name to Stax, from the first letters of Mr. Stewart and Ms. Axton's last names.         The label began regularly releasing hits through the 1960's. Musicians called Ms. Axton Lady A., and in Rob Bowman's ''Soulsville U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records'' (Schirmer Trade Books, 1997), the guitarist and songwriter Steve Cropper describes her as ''the heart and soul of that whole place.''         She nurtured songwriters, ran the record store and helped decide what Stax released, including, over her brother's initial opposition, Eddie Floyd's ''Knock on Wood.''         Although Stax was a musical powerhouse, it was a business debacle. After bad deals with major labels, the company went bankrupt in 1975. By then Ms. Axton was no longer with the company. In 1969, after disagreement about the label's direction, she quietly left the company in 1969, bought out by her brother and the label's president, Al Bell.         Part of her settlement included $25,000 a year on the condition that she stay out of the recording business. Her son Charles became the head of Fretone Records, and in 1974 Ms. Axton took over. That label's big hit, in 1976, was the Rick Dees novelty song ''Disco Duck.''         Ms. Axton is survived by her sister, Mary Lucille McAlpin; her brother, Mr. Stewart; her daughter, Doris Axton Fredrick; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Stax's headquarters was demolished in 1989, but last year a new building on the site, complete with a reproduction of the studio and a new Satellite Record Shop, opened as the Stax Museum of American Soul Music and the Stax Music Academy.       
         Ella Johnson, a jazz singer who performed with her brother Buddy Johnson in his dance bands in the 1940's and 50's, died in New York on Feb. 16, her nephew James Johnson Jr. said. She was 86.         A smooth singer with a seductive delivery, Ms. Johnson was often compared to Billie Holiday and Ella Fitzgerald. But as a part of her brother's rollicking bands, she also helped forge a link to R&B and early rock 'n' roll.         Ms. Johnson was born in Darlington, S.C., and moved to New York to join Buddy, her older brother, while still in her teens. Though only two years older than Ella, Buddy had become an established musician in New York and was leading groups at the Savoy Ballroom and elsewhere.         Her first hit with Buddy was ''Please, Mr. Johnson'' in 1940, and she continued to record and perform with him into the 1960's. Among her best-known songs was ''Since I Fell for You (1945), a ballad written by Buddy that was later performed by Mel Torm√© and George Shearing, Annie Laurie, Lenny Welch and others.         She also sang ''When My Man Comes Home,'' ''Hittin' on Me,'' ''Did You See Jackie Robinson Hit That Ball?'' and ''I Don't Want Nobody.''         Among her survivors are her husband, Odell Day; four brothers, Edward Parrott and Earl Johnson of Darlington, and Allan and Wesley Parrott of New York; a sister, Hattie Miller of Landover, Md.; and a granddaughter, Lisa.       
         Frances B. Schreuder, a Manhattan socialite convicted in 1983 of persuading her teenage son to kill her wealthy father in Utah because of what she considered his stinginess, died on Tuesday at a hospice in San Diego. She was 65.         The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, Marilyn Reagan, her sister, said. Ms. Schreuder (pronounced SHROY-der) lived in San Diego.         The murder of Franklin Bradshaw in Salt Lake City on July 23, 1978, provoked intense news coverage and led to two books, two television miniseries and, as recently as this year, a documentary on Court TV.         ''True crime is the hottest game in town,'' J. Anthony Lukas wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the two books, both published in 1985. One was ''My Mother's Request: A True Story of Money, Murder and Betrayal'' (Atheneum) by Jonathan Coleman; the other was ''Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder: A Family Album'' (Doubleday) by Shana Alexander.         ''This is 'Dallas' and 'Dynasty' come to life,'' Bill Wells, the director one of the miniseries, for CBS, said in an interview with The Times in 1986.         The crime indeed involved fascinating characters and plot twists. There was Ms. Schreuder, who bought $40,000 earrings at Tiffany's and sat on the board of the New York City Ballet. Mr. Bradshaw was one of the country's richest men and was known as Utah's Howard Hughes, but he bought his clothes at thrift shops and used a Coors beer carton as a briefcase.         Marc F. Schreuder, the grandson who shot Mr. Bradshaw in the back and head with a .357 Magnum, testified at his mother's trial that she had told him : ''Look, Marc, it is not really killing. It is the right thing to do for us.''         Frances Bernice Bradshaw was born on April 6, 1938, in Salt Lake City. She attended Bryn Mawr but was suspended in 1958 for stealing and forging checks and was told that she could return only if she received psychiatric help.         In the summer of 1958 she lived in Manhattan at the Barbizon Hotel for Women and met Vittorio Gentile, a pearl merchant, at Gino restaurant on Lexington Avenue. They married in 1959 at St. Patrick's Cathedral, and in 1960 had two sons, Lorenzo in February and Marco in December.         After the couple divorced, the sons were called Larry and Marc. Larry, who has changed his last name to Bradshaw, now lives in Los Angeles. Marc Schreuder lives in Provo, Utah. In addition to Ms. Reagan, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Schreuder is survived by a daughter from her second marriage, to Frederik Schreuder. She is Lavinia Schreuder of San Diego.         Mr. Coleman, the author, said in an interview that Frances Schreuder was skilled at manipulating her mother to get money, even as her father tired of supporting her extravagant life in New York. Her $360,000 donation to the New York City Ballet was the largest lump-sum contribution in the company's history up to that time.         At the time, news reports said she made contributions to the ballet and other New York causes, but Ms. Reagan said in an interview yesterday that Mrs. Schreuder's mother, Berenice Bradshaw, actually made most of them.         Mr. Bradshaw made his fortune by starting a chain of auto parts stores and acquiring federal oil and gas leases. Ms. Schreuder came to believe she might be disinherited, and her simmering resentment blossomed into a murder plot that at one point involved hiring what turned out to be a bogus hit man for $5,000.         The summer before the killing, when her sons went to Salt Lake City to work in their grandfather's company, she gave them poison to put in his food, Mr. Coleman said.         After the murder, the police first suspected a transient. But a year later, the murder weapon surfaced in Manhattan, and the police traced Marc Schreuder's journey days before the killing, to Utah by way of Texas, where he bought the murder weapon.         Although Mrs. Bradshaw spent $2 million on the legal defense of Marc Schreuder and his mother, Marc Schreuder was convicted of second-degree murder in 1982 and served 12 years in prison. Ms. Schreuder was convicted of first-degree murder the next year and was imprisoned for 13 years.         Marc Schreuder testified against his mother, saying she must be stopped, according to Mr. Coleman's book. ''I'm doing this for Lavinia,'' he said of his sister. ''Someone should care about Lavinia.''         Ms. Schreuder, who earned two sociology degrees while in prison, worked briefly for the Marriott Corporation in Salt Lake City before moving to San Diego. She inherited a comfortable income from her mother, despite family members' efforts to invoke a statute barring convicted killers from inheriting anything from their victims. A judge ruled that the law did not govern Berenice Bradshaw's choice of heirs.         Correction:  April 10, 2004, Saturday  An obituary on April 1 about Frances B. Schreuder, a Manhattan socialite convicted in 1983 of having arranged the murder of her father in Utah, misstated the time elapsed before the murder weapon was found and referred incorrectly to the college work she completed in prison. The weapon, a handgun, was found two years after the murder, not one. She earned a degree in psychology, not two in sociology. The article also misstated the title of a book about the case by Jonathan Coleman. It is ''At Mother's Request: A True Story of Money, Murder and Betrayal,'' not ''My Mother's Request.''       
         Mary Selway, the grand dame of British casting agents, who selected bouquets of cinematic talent for directors like Steven Spielberg, Roman Polanski and Clint Eastwood, died on April 21 in London, where she lived. She was 68.         The cause was cancer, said Nina Baron, a spokeswoman for New Line Features, for which she worked on several films.         She worked on more than 100 in all, including ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' which has not yet been released, and became in effect a collaborator of directors by her recruitment of the actors to embody their visions.         Many considered her triumph to be Robert Altman's 2001 film ''Gosford Park.'' She filled 54 speaking parts with stars like Maggie Smith and Michael Gambon, creating what many critics regarded as a seamless ensemble.         Her task was made more difficult by Mr. Altman's requirement that actors be present as background, visually and audibly, even when not scheduled to speak, a most unusual demand. Much of the time the movie's leading actors were, in effect, extras.         ''It wasn't difficult to cast,'' Ms. Selway said at the first screening of the movie, ''it was a joy.''         On that occasion Mr. Altman said of Ms. Selway, ''She's the person who is most responsible, other than me, for making this film happen.''         Other directors with whom Ms. Selway worked included Ridley Scott, John Boorman, Nicolas Roeg, James Cameron, John Madden, Michael Apted, Blake Edwards and Sydney Pollack.         Besides casting movies including ''Tess'' (1979), ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'' (1981), ''Out of Africa'' (1985). ''Gorillas in the Mist: The Story of Dian Fossey'' (1988), ''Emma'' (1996) and ''Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World'' (2003), she was associate producer of ''A Dry White Season'' (1989) and producer of ''Wuthering Heights'' (1992).         Mary Selway was born in Norwich, England, on March 14, 1936. Her father was a real estate manager and at one time managed a movie theater. At 13 she enrolled in the Italia Conti stage school in London and soon discovered she was too shy to be an actress, according to obituaries in The Guardian and Daily Variety. She tried modeling, but that also threatened her self-confidence.         She became a production assistant on television variety shows. Variety reported that she was so inexperienced that when she was asked to take a memo, she asked, ''What's a memo and where do I take it?''         In her 20's she worked for the casting director Miriam Brickman and was greatly influenced by her work with the director Lindsay Anderson, who she said in a letter to The Guardian in 1994 ''took me on an unremitting journey of truth.''         In 1999 she received the Michael Balcon Award from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts for outstanding contribution to British film over her 36-year career.         In an interview in 2000 with Netribution, a British film industry Web site, Ms. Selway discussed some of the difficulties of casting, including the ''inverted snobbery'' of directors who do not want to use the best actor for a part because another director has used him. She suggested that women were better in casting because they can better articulate emotion with actors and were less confrontational with directors.         In an interview with The Observer Ms. Selway mentioned how difficult it is to break casting stereotypes. ''Hugh Grant might hit it off with Edna Cabbagehead,'' she said, making up a name. Even so she ended up casting Julia Roberts for a leading role opposite Mr. Grant in ''Notting Hill'' in 1999.         Ms. Selway was married to the actor Norman Rodway, who died in 2001. She is survived by her partner, Aileen Maizel, and her two daughters with Keith Buckley, Emma and Kate Buckley, both of London.       
         Timi Yuro, the pop singer whose throaty and soulful delivery made ''Hurt'' and other songs hits in the early 1960's, died on March 30 at her home in Las Vegas. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said her niece, Michelle Duval.         Ms. Yuro's hits, like ''I Apologize,'' ''For the Love of a Boy'' and ''What's a Matter Baby (Is It Hurting You),'' featured her husky alto rising to dramatic climaxes above gentle orchestral accompaniment.         Her songs had the sentimentality of teenage pop, but in her vocals Ms. Yuro borrowed the bluesy intensity of black jazz singers like Dinah Washington and Nancy Wilson.         Ms. Yuro began her career with ''Hurt,'' which reached the Top 10 in 1961, and it remained her signature song. Though recorded when she was barely out of her teens, she sang it with a strength and finesse that earned her a reputation as a soul powerhouse; her voice was often mistaken for that of a black woman or a man.         Born Rosemary Timotea Aurro in Chicago, she moved to Los Angeles as a child and began singing in her family's Italian restaurant. She signed with Liberty Records in 1959 and recorded ''Hurt'' with Clyde Otis, who had been a producer for Dinah Washington. The song, which had first been an R & B hit for Roy Hamilton in 1953, was later sung by Elvis Presley and Juice Newton.         Ms. Yuro had a string of hits with Liberty until she left the label in 1964, when she began recording with Mercury and other companies. She quit in the 1970's and her attempts to return to music in the early 80's were stymied by throat cancer.         She is survived by her husband, Robert Selnick, of Las Vegas, from whom she had separated; a daughter, Milan Reinoehl; a brother, Anthony; and three grandchildren.       
         Doris Dowling, who made an impression as a husky-voiced character actress in the film classics ''The Lost Weekend,'' ''The Blue Dahlia'' and ''Bitter Rice,'' died on June 18 in Los Angeles. She was 81.         Her death was announced by Lee Redmond, a family friend.         Ms. Dowling was the brunette sibling of a well-known blond actress of the era, Constance Dowling. The sisters appeared together when Doris made her Broadway debut in the 1940 hit musical ''Panama Hattie.''         She was back on Broadway briefly in ''Banjo Eyes'' (1941), ''Beat the Band'' (1942), ''New Faces of 1943'' and, later, in a revival of ''The Women'' (1973). But she spent the better part of her career in Hollywood and in Italy, where Constance had gone to work as an expatriate.         After an unheralded beginning in an earlier Raymond Chandler movie, ''And Now Tomorrow'' (1944), she made an auspicious appearance in ''The Lost Weekend'' (1945), an Oscar-winning film starring Ray Milland as an alcoholic. Ms. Dowling played Gloria, the available barfly with a heart whom he meets on his downward spiral.         In ''The Blue Dahlia'' (1946), a Raymond Chandler thriller starring Alan Ladd, she was the faithless wife who is murdered.         In Italy, Ms. Dowling took the part of Francesca, a gangster moll hiding among rice workers, in ''Riso Amaro'' (1949). The film gave the actress Silvana Mangano her sensational start and opened as ''Bitter Rice'' in this country in 1950.         Ms. Dowling made several more pictures in Italy and France, among them Orson Welles's version of ''Othello'' (1952), in which she played the small role of Bianca; Welles portrayed the Moor.         After returning to this country, she was a frequent guest star on television into the 1980's, and appeared often on the stage in Los Angeles.         Ms. Dowling was married three times. In 1952 she became the seventh of the bandleader Artie Shaw's eight wives. Her marriage to him was dissolved, but their son, Jonathan Shaw, survives, according to The Associated Press. In 1960 she married Leonard B. Kaufman, a television producer, who also survives her.         Constance Dowling died in Los Angeles in 1969. She was 49.       
         Frances Hansen, a self-described housewife who marshaled imagination -- surely not malice -- to make crossword puzzles she constructed more puzzling by using her own poems as clues, died on Friday at a hospital in Perth Amboy, N.J. She was 85.         The cause was complications of a stroke, Betty Lee Solley, her niece, said.         The New York Times published 82 of Mrs. Hansen's puzzles, with the 83rd scheduled for the Christmas issue of the paper's Sunday magazine. She had written every Christmas puzzle since 1995 and had become the second most prolific living writer of Sunday puzzles and the fourth most published of all time.         The Washington Post, The Los Angeles Times and book publishers like Dell, Random House and Simon & Schuster also printed puzzles she constructed.         Will Shortz, The New York Times crossword puzzle editor, said Mrs. Hansen ''caused a sensation'' with her first puzzle in the paper in December 1964. The puzzle was built around Lewis Carroll's 1872 book, ''Through the Looking-Glass and What Alice Found There,'' and required potential solvers to think backward.         The clue was ''a well-known part of ykcowrebbaj, and the answer was ''ebarge out shtar emom eht dna.'' (Lewis's penchant for making up words like Jabberwocky didn't make it any easier.)         Her original limericks became her best-known trademark. Margaret Farrar, a former editor of The New York Times puzzles, at first questioned the originality of the poems because they were so good. Mrs. Hansen assuaged the editor's doubt by sending her clippings of little poems she had had printed in Good Housekeeping and other magazines.         One of Mr. Shortz's favorites goes like this:         Said W. Somerset Maugham         I shall visit the island of Guam.         If I find it is hot,         I shall leave on the spot.         I detest feeling overly waugham.         Frances Mabel Tucker was born on June 21, 1919, in Arlington, N.J., and lived in Metuchen since her childhood. She never attended college nor took any special courses. Her husband, Ernest R. Hansen, a bank president, died in 1983.         She is survived by her sons, Warren, of Forest Hills, Queens, and John, of Germantown, Tenn., and two granddaughters.         Helene Hovanec, the author of a book on crossword puzzle constructors called ''Creative Cruciverbalists'' (Morrow, 1988), said that Mrs. Hansen taught Sunday school for 12 years and noticed, when she quit, that her friends were addicted to the Sunday puzzle.         Mrs. Hansen followed suit and soon hit upon the unlikely idea that constructing puzzles might be easier than doing them because you knew all the answers. She was disabused of this notion when The Times summarily rejected her first puzzle for mistakes common to novice puzzle constructors: using two-letter words and having a very high word count.         Eight months later, her next one was accepted. Mr. Shortz said she went on to perfect her specialty within the rigor of The Times's 21 by 21 squares. Part of the challenge is to keep the black squares symmetrical, a tradition started by Mrs. Farrar because she thought they looked pretty that way.         ''She usually writes an original verse with five lines and each line is exactly 21 letters,'' Mr. Shortz said. ''Perfect rhyme and perfect meter, and it's funny besides.''         Mrs. Hansen was a leader of a group of cruciverbalists who regularly talk shop at a Manhattan restaurant and that has included the last four Times crossword puzzle editors. She organized their last meeting, last month.         In 1987, Mrs. Hansen told The Washington Post that puzzles came to her in her sleep. She said they were left by the ''idea fairy.''         Correction:  July 16, 2004, Friday  An obituary yesterday about Frances Hansen, a constructor of crossword puzzles, misstated part of the solution to a 1964 puzzle she designed around Lewis Carroll's book ''Through the Looking-Glass.'' The clue, rendered in reverse, was ''well-known part of 'Ykcowrebbaj'' (Jabberwocky). The answer, also rendered in reverse, was ''ebargtuo shtar emom eht dna'' (and the mome raths outgrabe), not ''ebarge out shtar emom eht dna.''       
         Laura Branigan, a singer whose high-volume vocals in the disco-style song ''Gloria'' propelled her into pop stardom, died in her sleep Thursday night at her home in East Quogue, N.Y. She was 47.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her brother Mark Branigan.         After touring as a backup singer with Leonard Cohen, Ms. Branigan released her first album, ''Branigan,'' in 1982. It included ''Gloria,'' which became a hit, lasting on the pop charts for 36 weeks.         Other hits followed, including ''Solitaire,'' ''How Am I Supposed to Live Without You?'' and ''Self Control,'' although she continued to be most known for ''Gloria,'' her brother said.         After her husband, Larry Kruteck, died in 1996, she took time off from her music career.         In 2002, she starred in ''Love, Janis,'' an Off Broadway musical about Janis Joplin. At the time of her death, she was midway through work on new album, Mr. Branigan said.         Ms. Branigan was born on July 3, 1957, in Westchester County, N.Y. She attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts in Manhattan.         She is survived by her mother, Kathleen, who lived with her in East Quogue; two brothers, Mark and Billy, both of Manhattan; and a sister, Susan, of Connecticut.       
         Izora Rhodes Armstead, one half of the disco-pop duo the Weather Girls, who sang the flamboyant and enduring club hit ''It's Raining Men,'' died on Sept. 16 at a hospital in San Leandro, Calif. Her age was unknown.         The cause was heart failure, The San Francisco Chronicle reported. The church where Ms. Armstead's funeral was held, St. John Missionary Baptist in San Francisco, confirmed her death.         ''It's Raining Men,'' a bombastic vocal romp that winkingly borrowed from gospel music -- ''Hallelujah, it's raining men, amen!'' goes its chorus -- was one of the biggest hits of the genre known as hi-NRG, a souped-up version of disco that ruled dance clubs in the 1980's.         Sung with gusto by Ms. Armstead, then known as Izora Rhodes, and her partner, Martha Wash, the song only reached No. 46 on the pop charts when it was released in 1983, but hit No. 1 on the club charts and later reached No. 2 in England.         Written by Paul Jabara and Paul Shaffer -- now of ''Late Show With David Letterman'' -- the song has since become an anthem of the gay club scene and in 2001 it again reached the top of the British charts with a version by a former Spice Girl, Geri Halliwell.         The song was the centerpiece of the group's first album, ''Success,'' which featured another booming Jabara-Shaffer composition, ''Dear Santa (Bring Me a Man This Christmas)'' and a version of Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair.''         Ms. Armstead and Ms. Wash met in San Francisco in the mid-70's when they both joined a gospel group called Now (News of the World). They were soon recruited to sing backup for Sylvester, a cross-dressing disco singer with a local following.         The two sang on four Sylvester albums, including the hit songs ''Dance (Disco Heat)'' and ''(You Make Me Feel) Mighty Real.''         The two went solo in 1979 under the name Two Tons o' Fun, a play on their Rubenesque physiques. They issued one album under that name before rechristening themselves the Weather Girls for ''Success.'' They recorded two more albums before disbanding in the late 80's.         After the Weather Girls, Ms. Wash sang, often anonymously, for C and C Music Factory, Black Box and other groups, and Ms. Armstead moved to Germany to found a new Weather Girls group with her daughter Dynell Rhodes, who survives Ms. Armstead, along with six other children and several grandchildren.       
         Rose Gacioch, an outstanding outfielder and pitcher in the heyday of women's professional baseball who became a mainstay of the Rockford Peaches team later featured in the movie ''A League of Their Own,'' died last Thursday at a nursing home in Clinton Township, Mich. She was 89.         Her death was announced by a niece, Helen Bozicevich.         Gacioch (pronounced GAY-sotch), a native of Wheeling, W.Va., was in grade school when she sneaked out of class to see Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig play on a barnstorming stop, and she was thrilled when Gehrig shook her hand. At 16, she was the only girl on a town baseball team called the Little Cardinals.         While still in her teens, she played one season for the All Star Ranger Girls, a barnstorming women's team.         In 1944, after working in a West Virginia factory and playing softball, she joined the South Bend (Ind.) Blue Sox in the All-American Girls Baseball League, created the previous season by the Chicago Cubs' owner, Philip K. Wrigley, to provide entertainment if major league baseball was curtailed by World War II.         Gacioch played right field, and, as she told Susan E. Johnson in an interview for ''When Women Played Hardball,'' she had a phenomenal assist total, thanks to a move by her manager, Bert Niehoff, a former National League infielder.         As she remembered it: ''Bert said: 'Rose, I'm gonna put the second baseman closer to second, and the first baseman closer to first. Now you've got all that territory in between. Come in and flip the ball to first.' Batters would see a big space in right field, hit toward it. I'd run in, field the ball and throw them out at first. Twice in my career, I had 31 assists from right field, a league record.''         Gacioch was sent to the Rockford (Ill.) Peaches the next year and played the outfield and pitched for them until the league folded after the 1954 season. She won 92 games and lost 60 and was a three-time All-Star, according to Ms. Johnson. She played on four championship teams with the Peaches.         Gacioch later worked in a factory in Rockford, retired in 1978, then lived in the Detroit area. She never married and is survived most immediately by three nieces.         Interest in women's baseball was revived long after the demise of the All-American Girls Baseball League. In 1988, the Hall of Fame created a Women in Baseball exhibit honoring the players of that league, and in 1992, ''A League of Their Own,'' starring Madonna, Geena Davis, Rosie O'Donnell and Tom Hanks, provided a Hollywood version of the Peaches' exploits.         Gacioch visited Cooperstown for the exhibition opening and reveled in her niche at the Hall of Fame. As she said in the interview reflecting on her career: ''I always say: 'Now I got something on Pete Rose. I got there before he did.'''
