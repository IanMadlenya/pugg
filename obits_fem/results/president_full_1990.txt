        India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         Mrs. Edwards was unanimously elected to the national committee in 1950. She was first associated with the committee as a volunteer in the 1944 Presidential campaign. From 1945 to 1947 she was executive secretary of the women's division, which she served as associate director before becoming the committee's vice chairwoman.         Mrs. Edwards remained active in the Democratic Party for more than 30 years, through several generations of Democratic politicians, including Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.         For 22 years before she became active in politics she was on the staff of The Chicago Tribune, where she was society editor and woman's editor. She left the paper to marry her third husband, Herbert T. Edwards, a State Department official, and moved to Washington in 1942. Mr. Edwards died in the late 1970's.         Campaigning With Truman         Mrs. Edwards accompanied Mr. Truman, her political hero, on his 1948 campaign tour, where she repeatedly expressed her confidence in his victory at the polls.         At one point the President turned to her and sighed. ''India,'' he said, ''sometimes I think there are only two people who believe I will win. You and me.'' ''That's enough,'' she replied. Largely because of Mrs. Edwards's influence, Mr. Truman appointed more women to top jobs than any preceding President. Among them were Eugenia Anderson as Ambassador to Denmark, Perle Mesta as Minister to Luxembourg, Ruth Bryan Rohde as an alternate delegate to the United Nations and Georgia Neese Clark as Treasurer of the United States.         Explaining how she worked to increase the number of women in Federal jobs, Mrs. Edwards recalled: ''Sometimes I felt like a ghoul. I'd read the obits, and as soon as a man had died, I'd rush over to the White House and suggest a woman to replace him.''         Mrs. Edwards, who was named for her mother and her grandmother, was born in Chicago and grew up in Nashville. Her memoirs, ''Pulling No Punches,'' were published by G. P. Putnam's in 1977.         Mrs. Edward's daughter, India Moffett Williams, died in 1979, and her son, John Holbrook Moffett, died in World War II. She is survived by five grandchildren.

        Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         Ava Gardner, a North Carolina sharecropper's daughter who became one of the most bewitching movie actresses in the world, died of pneumonia yesterday at her home in the Kensington section of London. She was 67 years old.         The star's death was announced by Paul Mills, a longtime friend and film producer, who said she had been ill for some time, particularly with respiratory problems, and had a stroke more than three years ago.         The actress had lived quietly in London for more than 30 year after being hounded for decades by photographers and reporters who publicized her marriages to Mickey Rooney, the band leader Artie Shaw and Frank Sinatra and her flamboyant escapades with matadors, international playboys and writers.         Working on Her Memoirs         Miss Gardner, who had been completing her memoirs, said in a recent interview, ''If you don't tell your side, the self-appointed biographers step in, adding to the abysmal lies.''         The actress, whose green eyes, chestnut hair, high cheekbones and sensual lips made her eminently photogenic, was known for femme fatale portrayals.         She brought a tigresslike seductiveness and a husky-voiced irreverence to roles as worldly, devil-may-care women, becoming adept at playing exotic vamps and free-spirited protagonists, as in films of such Ernest Hemingway stories as ''The Killers'' (1946), ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro'' (1952) and ''The Sun Also Rises'' (1957). In the loosely autobiographical ''Barefoot Contessa'' (1954), she played a fiery dancer who becomes a movie star.         Praise for Later Roles         She portrayed torch singers in ''The Hucksters'' (1947) and ''Show Boat'' (1951); an irrepressible playgirl in ''Mogambo'' (a 1953 role for which she won an Academy Award nomination); a tormented Anglo-Indian in ''Bhowani Junction'' (1956); a thoughtful cosmopolitan in ''On the Beach'' (1959), and a blowsy innkeeper in the film of Tennessee Williams's ''Night of the Iguana'' (1964).         Although she was mainly decorative in most of her early roles and many reviewers said her acting range was narrow, she won wide praise for many later performances. Nonetheless, she consistently denigrated her talent, remarking to a 1985 interviewer: ''Listen, honey, I was never really an actress. None of us kids who came from M-G-M were. We were just good to look at.''         Poverty in Childhood         Ava Lavinia Gardner was born on Dec. 24, 1922, in Grabton, a poor community outside Smithfield, N.C., to Jonas Bailey Gardner, a tobacco and cotton farmer, and Mary Elizabeth Gardner. Her father died when she was 16, and her mother then managed a boardinghouse.         Her childhood was marked by poverty and a wardrobe so meager it prompted ridicule from schoolmates. She took commercial courses in high school, and an older brother paid her tuition so she could continue secretarial studies for a year at Atlantic Christian College in Wilson, N.C.         At 18, she visited her eldest sister, Beatrice, in New York City, on a journey that transformed her life. Her brother-in-law, Larry Tarr, a commercial photographer, took a portfolio of pictures of her and sent them to Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. She was given a screen test in New York that was made without sound because of her heavy Southern drawl. The 1941 test won her a seven-year M-G-M contract and intensive diction lessons as well as a starlet's standard classes in acting, calisthenics, makeup and fashion.         Her next five years were notable for tiny roles in a score of mostly forgettable movies, a blizzard of publicity pictures - and two brief marriages, to Mickey Rooney and Artie Shaw. Each marriage ended in separation after less than a year and finally in divorce.         The 69-year-old Mr. Rooney, upon learning of her death, said yesterday, ''My heart is broken with the loss of my first love.''         Stardom at 24         Miss Gardner later attributed the brevity of the first marriage to the couple's youth and to other people's domination of their lives. A press agent invariably accompanied them, even on their honeymoon. Of the second marriage, Miss Gardner said, Mr. Shaw insisted she read scores of books and insulted her intelligence in public.         Despite the personal setbacks, Miss Gardner won stardom at the age of 24 as a gun moll who betrays her lover (Burt Lancaster in his film debut) in ''The Killers.'' Other early starring roles were in a musical, ''One Touch of Venus'' (1948); a melodrama, ''The Great Sinner'' (1949), and a fantasy, ''Pandora and the Flying Dutchman'' (1951).         Miss Gardner's third marriage, to Frank Sinatra in 1951, was one of the most publicized Hollywood unions of the time. The couple had bitter public quarrels and separated in 1953 but tried a series of brief cross-country, trans-Atlantic reconciliations. They were finally divorced in 1957.         In a 1986 book, ''His Way: The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra,'' Kitty Kelley attributed the following quotation to the actress:         ''You start with love, or what you think is love, and then comes the work. I guess you have to be mature and grown up to know how to work at it. But I was the youngest of seven kids and was always treated like the baby, and I liked it and played the baby. Now I'm having a helluva time growing up.''         On TV as Nero's Mother         In 1958 Miss Gardner left M-G-M and became an independent actress, earning up to $400,000 a movie, most of them made in Europe. Her films included ''55 Days at Peking'' (1963), ''Seven Days in May'' (1964), ''Mayerling'' (1969), ''The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean'' (1972), ''The Blue Bird'' (1976) and a handful of disaster epics.         She did not appear on television until 1985, portraying Agrippina, Nero's scheming mother, in ''A.D.,'' a lavish mini-series about the first Christian century, and reviewers hailed her as still very much a star. Asked about her reluctance to accept television roles, she replied: ''Television is a lovely thing for people of my age to watch, but it's for young people to make. The kids were very nice to me.''         In the 1950's, the actress was deeply in love with Spain, bullfighting and, reportedly, a succession of bullfighters.         Her celebrated candor made her friends and enemies. When she arrived in Australia to make ''On the Beach,'' she enraged many people by remarking, ''I'm here to make a film about the end of the world, and this sure is the place for it.''         Sympathetic interviewers described her as an outgoing, earthy woman who had a lively sense of humor, particularly about herself, and deep family loyalty. Looking ahead to retirement, Miss Gardner once remarked: ''When I'm old and gray, I want to have a house by the sea. And paint. With a lot of wonderful chums, good music and booze around. And a damn good kitchen to cook in.''         Survivors include two sisters, Beatrice, of Hollywood, and Myra, of Smithfield, N.C., and nieces and nephews.         At her wish, she is to be buried beside her parents in North Carolina.         From a Moll to Guinevere         Ava Gardner appeared in about 60 movies, starting in 1942 and ending in 1981. These were the films for which she was most noted:         The Killers         The Hucksters         One Touch of Venus         Show Boat         Pandora and the Flying Dutchman         The Snows of Kilimanjaro         Mogambo         Knights of the Round Table         The Barefoot Contessa         Bhowani Junction         The Sun Also Rises         The Naked Maja         On the Beach         The Night of the Iguana         The Life and Times of Judge Roy Bean         The Cassandra Crossing         The Kidnapping of the President

        Rachel Fitler, heiress to a rope-manufacturing fortune, died Wednesday at her home in Villanova, Pa. She was 93 years old.         Rachel Fitler, heiress to a rope-manufacturing fortune, died Wednesday at her home in Villanova, Pa. She was 93 years old.         Miss Fitler, who was an equestrian, figured in news reports in 1974 and 1975 because of her friendship with Michael Wilson, a 29-year-old former bartender.         Mr. Wilson said the two were engaged, but that has been disputed in Miss Fitler's family. At one point, retainers at her house summoned the police to eject Mr. Wilson, the son of a Welsh coal miner.         A granddaughter of a Mayor of Philadelphia, Edwin H. Fitler, Miss Fitler graduated from the University of Pennsylvania.         Her survivors include a niece, Margaretta Fitler Rockefeller of Pocantico Hills, N.Y., the widow of Nelson A. Rockefeller, who was Vice President from 1974 to 1977 after being Governor of New York.       
        Sister R. Mildred Barker, the spiritual leader of Maine's Shaker community, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 92 years old.         Sister R. Mildred Barker, the spiritual leader of Maine's Shaker community, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 92 years old.         Her death leaves just eight people in the last active Maine community of Shakers, celibate Protestants who stress pacifism and the communal sharing of material goods.         In 1931 Sister Mildred was put in charge of the Shakers' jelly and jam industry and candy-making business. In 1960 she was chosen trustee of the community, overseeing business and financial matters. The community raises sheep and grows apples and herbs.         President Ronald Reagan recognized her in 1983 for her expertise in singing old Shaker songs, many of which were recorded on four albums.         There are no immediate survivors.

Evelyn Ames, a poet and prose writer whose works on wildlife and the environment were praised by reviewers as graceful and intense, but not sentimental, died on Thursday at St. Johnland Nursing Home in Kings Park, L.I. She was 81 years old and had homes in Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., and Martha's Vineyard.         ''A Glimpse of Eden,'' recounting a safari in East Africa, joined ''a poet's urge to describe her experience in beautiful and even fanciful terms, and a thinker's urge to generalize about it,'' wrote Orville Prescott in a 1967 review in The New York Times.         ''She strikes just the right note when she remarks on the bond of sympathy she felt for lions,'' the critic wrote, concluding, ''It takes a poet like Evelyn Ames to see the 'tender affection' of lions.'' John C. Devlin of The Times termed the work ''sharp-eyed and lyrical.''         Other volumes included ''In Time Like Glass: Reflections on a Journey in Asia'' (1974); ''Only the Loving,'' a 1952 novel; and two books of poetry: ''The Hawk From Heaven'' (1957) and ''Dust on a Precipice'' (1981).         Daughter of a Professor         The writer, whose given name was Evelyn Perkins, was born to a physics professor and an actress in Hamden, Conn., grew up in Hartford, and was educated at Milton Academy and Vassar College.

A widow, she is survived by a stepson, Thomas, of New London, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Katherine Way of Stonington, Conn., and a granddaughter.       
        Josephine Young Case, a poet and writer and the first woman to be a director of the Radio Corporation of America, died on Monday at the Harding Nursing Home in Waterville, N.Y. She was 82 years old and lived in Van Hornesville, N.Y.         Josephine Young Case, a poet and writer and the first woman to be a director of the Radio Corporation of America, died on Monday at the Harding Nursing Home in Waterville, N.Y. She was 82 years old and lived in Van Hornesville, N.Y.         Mrs. Case was the sole daughter of Owen D. and Josephine Edmonds Young. Mr. Young was chairman of the General Electric Company and founded the Radio Corporation of America.         She was educated at the Brearley School and at Bryn Mawr College. In 1931, after her marriage to Everett Needham Case, she received an M.A. in American literature at Radcliffe College. After her family moved to her father's native town of Van Hornesville, she wrote and published her first book, ''At Midnight on the 31st of March'' (1938), in blank verse. The Syracuse University Press will reprint it in the spring.         For 20 years while her husband was president of Colgate University, Mrs. Case taught a literature course at Colgate and published ''Written in Sand'' (1945), a historical novel, and ''Freedom's Farm'' (1946), a poetry collection. Her writing included a biography of her father, ''Owen D. Young and American Enterprise'' (1982), in which her husband collaborated.         She became the first female director of RCA in 1961, and remained in the post until 1972. She was also a board member of Bryn Mawr, the Fund for the Advancement of Education and the National Merit Scholarship Corporation. She was also a member of the national board of the Girl Scouts from 1948 to 1953 and was on the board of the Saratoga Performing Arts Center in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., in the mid-60's.         A trustee of Skidmore College for many years, Mrs. Case became chairwoman of the board in 1960.         In addition to her husband, survivors include a brother, Richard Young, and a daughter, Josephine Edmonds Case, both of Van Hornesville; three sons, James 3d and John, both of Cambridge, Mass., and Samuel, of Fairfax, Calif.; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandson.

She was 58 years old and also had a house on Tuckernuck Island, Mass.         Felicia Clark, an urban-planning consultant, died of complications from a stroke on Tuesday at her home in Boston. She was 58 years old and also had a house on Tuckernuck Island, Mass.         Ms. Clark worked on planning in New York in the 1960's. She was planning director for community high schools and later coordinator of educational development for the state's Urban Development Corporation, planning schools and similar centers for Roosevelt Island and other sites. She was elected to Community School Board 2 in Manhattan and was on the State Republican Committee.         In 1975, Ms. Clark became principal consultant and planner to the Regional Plan Association for the Gateway National Recreational Area.         Ms. Clark was the wife of Todd Granville Lee, also an urban planner. They moved to Boston in 1977, where Ms. Clark formed the Community Facilities Planning Group. She directed the Downtown Boston Waterfront Project. At her death, she was also vice president and director of planning for Todd Lee/Clark/Rozas Associates Inc.         Also surviving are a daughter and three sons, Story Clark Resor of Jackson, Wyo., Joseph 3d, of Los Angeles, Christopher, of Manhattan, and Laurance, of Cambridge, Mass.; two sisters, Anne Witherby of Boston and Rosamund Bodman of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.

Veola Lederer, a former executive of a Manhattan leather boutique and a former museum vice president, died of a heart attack on Wednesday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., while spending the winter in Pompano Beach. She was 81 years old and lived in Stockbridge. Mass.  Mrs. Lederer was the widow of Ludwig G. Lederer. In World War II, while her husband taught celestial navigation to pilots in Mississippi, she managed his Fifth Avenue leather goods store, Lederer de Paris. The store was later sold. Mr. Lederer died in 1960.         Mrs. Lederer was a board member and president of Young Audiences Inc., which presents classical music programs for schoolchildren. She was also a volunteer with the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.         In the 1970's and 1980's, she was a volunteer, a board member and vice president of Hancock Shaker Community, a nonprofit museum in Pittsfield, Mass.         She was a graduate of the New England Conservatory of Music and studied harp and voice for two years in Salzburg and Vienna.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Iphigene Ochs Sulzberger, who shaped the history of The New York Times throughout a long and active life, died of respiratory failure in her sleep yesterday morning at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Sulzberger nurtured and bridged the generations of the family that has controlled The Times since 1896, when her father, Adolph S. Ochs, acquired it as a small and ailing property. She played an important role in selecting the succeeding publishers -her husband, Arthur Hays Sulzberger; her son-in-law Orvil E. Dryfoos, and her son, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger.         From all of them, Mrs. Sulzberger gained a unique view of the great events and personalities of the 20th century and of the paper's growth in covering them. To all of them, she conveyed the traditions of The Times and its dedication to serious journalism, to good taste and to progressive values.         Mrs. Sulzberger also served the paper as a director and as a trustee for the stock left by her father. And she strove to preserve the family ties among her 4 children, 13 grandchildren and 24 great-grandchildren.         At her request, cremation and interment will be private. A public memorial service will be held tomorrow at 1 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue at 65th Street. The family requests that in lieu of flowers, contributions be made to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund or to Mrs. Sulzberger's alma mater, Barnard College.         Besides cherishing the values of The Times, Mrs. Sulzberger read the paper diligently and regularly, but only modestly offered the editors ideas and news tips. She also wrote droll letters to the editor on issues great and small, asking that they be thrown out if judged foolish, or published with only a pseudonym, usually the name of a dead relative or friend.         Devotion to the Parks         A woman of energy, social conscience and impish humor, Mrs. Sulzberger pursued a variety of other interests, notably those devoted to parks and the environment, to Barnard, education and libraries, and to the welfare of animals.         She once inspired a series of articles that demonstrated the public's low interest and competence in history, a series that won The Times a Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1944 and provoked curriculum changes in many states. She also encouraged the paper to develop its potential as a classroom aid to teachers, which helped to make it the most widely circulated daily newspaper in schools and colleges.         Mrs. Sulzberger's own history of her experiences, a largely anecdotal memoir as told to her granddaughter Susan W. Dryfoos, was privately printed for friends and family in 1979 and then published by Dodd, Mead & Company in 1981 under the title ''Iphigene.''         In a foreword, the historian Barbara W. Tuchman said of Mrs. Sulzberger, ''She is high-class in every way a woman can function - in devotion to family, in strong social conscience, in elegance of person and winning ways that gain her ends, in alert intelligence and irreverent humor, in energy and unfailing curiosity, in friendship and a welcoming home.''         Quiet but Decided Influence         Throughout her life, Mrs. Sulzberger had a quiet but decided influence on The Times. Perhaps the first time was at the age of 13, when her father discovered that she was using her weekly allowance to buy newspapers that carried comics. Mr. Ochs relented in his own opposition and decided to publish a Timesian strip, called ''The Roosevelt Bears.'' It ran for only six months, in 1906; Iphigene pronounced it boring.         When her husband was publisher, Mrs. Sulzberger's influence on The Times went beyond encouraging wider news coverage, to advocating divergent editorial views. She disagreed with Mr. Sulzberger by siding with the Republican forces in the Spanish Civil War against the Franco forces, by favoring statehood for Israel to provide a home for displaced European Jews and by preferring Adlai E. Stevenson instead of Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower for President.         When The Times endorsed Eisenhower in 1952, Mrs. Sulzberger told her husband she would vote for the general ''out of love for you and loyalty to The Times.'' But in 1956 she deserted the newspaper's position and voted for Stevenson.         ''I felt I had discharged my obligation to the paper four years earlier,'' she explained in her memoirs.         Encouraged by her parents to be curious and undogmatic about the world around her, Mrs. Sulzberger cultivated a well-stocked mind. She read and traveled extensively all her life, from the time her parents took her with them on their first grand tour of Europe when she was 8 years old.         One of her most joyous trips was a three-week visit to China in 1973, an experience she considered a high point of her life. Her 81st birthday fell during her stay in Beijing, where her Chinese hosts insisted on giving a banquet in her honor. She was also received by Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, who expressed his regard for Mrs. Sulzberger by inviting her to dinner and by talking with her at length about China and world issues.         She was the matriarch of the family and, according to one of her children, ''the glue that held us all together.'' When she was nearing 80, she began spending several days annually with grandchildren at schools in the Boston area, an effort to understand the outlook and life style of young people.         Chess for Central Park         Although Mrs. Sulzberger's major interests were her family and The Times, she embraced a number of civic and educational institutions. In 1928 she joined the Park Association, a volunteer group devoted to improving the city's parks. She became its president in 1934 and held the office until 1950, when she was elected chairman. She gave up that post in 1957 but kept her active membership.         Two results of her work for the parks particularly pleased her: getting the financier Bernard M. Baruch to contribute a chess and checkers house to Central Park and helping to restore Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx.         In 1976 Mrs. Sulzberger received the annual award of the Parks Council - a citizens' group into which the Park Association had merged - for her continuing work on environmental issues. In particular the award cited a work-study program she had founded in Central Park several years earlier, which was duplicated in other parks.         Four years later Mrs. Sulzberger was named honorary chairman of the newly formed Central Park Conservancy, a group of private citizens who raise funds for Central Park. She also received the Distinguished Alumna Award from Barnard College and the gold medal of the National Institute of Social Sciences for distinguished service to humanity.         At the Jewish Theological Seminary she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree in 1968 for her work in public, philanthropic and educational activities.         Another of Mrs. Sulzberger's avocations involved the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Her zeal reflected the delight she took in gardening and in flowers. She was a keen supporter of the institution's program to train student gardeners in cooperation with nearby Christopher Columbus High School. The garden honored her in 1965 with its distinguished service award.         Mrs. Sulzberger was also active in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, where she backed programs to train young people in restoring furniture and paintings.         Educational opportunity for youth was the thread that bound together Mrs. Sulzberger's ''outside'' interests.         The chief example of this was Barnard College, on whose board she sat from 1937 to 1968, when she became a trustee emeritus. Her happiest achievement in this work was gathering funds for a library. The building, called the Adele Lehman Hall-Wollman Library, cost $2.15 million and was dedicated in 1960. The alumnae citation in 1972 spoke of ''excellence and service, intelligence and old-fashioned hard work.''         Columbia University, at its 1951 commencement, gave Mrs. Sulzberger a Doctor of Laws degree, citing her as the ''distinguished daughter of a distinguished father'' and praising her civic involvement as well as her role at The Times.         In addition to her occupation with Barnard affairs, she served at various times as a trustee of the Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which gave her an honorary Doctorate of Humane Letters in 1973, and of the University of Chattanooga. She was on the committee for the Dictionary of American Biography and on the advisory committee for publication of the works of Thomas Jefferson, a Princeton University project.         Honor From a Black College         She was also on the boards of the Cedar Knolls School (where she had once worked) and the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, and on the board of managers of Inwood House, a home for unmarried mothers.         Mrs. Sulzberger had been a director of Yaddo, a colony for artists and writers in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., that inherited a block of Times stock. In addition, she was involved with the State Communities Aid Association, the National Urban League, the Association on American Indian Affairs and the New York Girl Scout Council. The council at one time met at her home because it could not find a suitable interracial gathering place.         In January 1978, she was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Bishop College of Dallas, then the largest predominantly black private college in the Southwest, and was commended for having been the largest single private donor in the history of the United Negro College Fund. ''She has contributed more than $35,000 a year in the past decade,'' the citation said.         Later that year Mrs. Sulzberger, a prime mover in setting up a program that let high school students alternate classroom studies with store and business jobs, received an award from the New York City Board of Education; it cited her as ''an outstanding friend of cooperative education.''         Amid these activities she found time to be interested in polar explorations, an interest shared with her husband. One result was Adm. Richard E. Byrd's naming of a body of water Sulzberger Bay; it is in Antarctica, off Marie Byrd Land. Its cold blue surface reflects a mountain, Mount Iphigene.         A Rabbi's Granddaughter         Born on Sept. 19, 1892, Iphigene Bertha Ochs grew up as the only child of Adolph S. and Iphigenia Wise Ochs. Her father was then proprietor of The Chattanooga Times, a growing Tennessee newspaper. Her mother was the daughter of Isaac Mayer Wise, rabbi of the Plum Street Temple in Cincinnati and founder of American Reform Judaism.         Iphigene's classical name, often shortened by her family to Iffy or If, proved a boon. Anyone who met her could forever greet her by name. ''Who could ever forget a name like Iphigene?'' she once asked.         On Aug. 13, 1896, Mr. Ochs bought the faltering New York Times, and soon the family moved from Chattanooga to New York. The child was educated at home until she was 8, when she was sent to Dr. Sachs's School for Girls. Her schooling at home, which Mrs. Sulzberger later called ''rather haphazard,'' nonetheless gave her a good grounding in history and literature.         When she learned to read, she said, her parents supplied her with ''one-syllable history books on Rome and Greece and France and the United States,'' along with fiction. Her mother also took her regularly to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, and to the theater.         Mr. Ochs introduced his daughter to other worlds - the pleasures of walking, the mysteries of the newspaper business and delight in the ideas of other people.         ''Unquestionably, the high point of my week was Sunday, when my father stayed home and took me to Central Park,'' Mrs. Sulzberger said of her girlhood. ''He was a great walker. I learned to enjoy it, too.''         These walks were for fun and education. One of their Sunday trips was to the cemetery in the tiny Joseph Rodman Drake Park in the Bronx. Mr. Ochs walked his daughter to the grave of the poet for whom the park was named and pointed to the tombstone inscription composed by Fitz-Greene Halleck for his friend in 1820:         Green be the turf above thee         Friend of my better days!         None knew thee but to love thee,         Nor named thee but to praise.         Mr. Ochs told Iphigene that he wanted the last two lines placed on his gravestone. The request was quite premature: Mr. Ochs lived until 1935. But his daughter then complied with the wish.         Mr. Ochs also took her to the newspaper office. ''What I remember best about The Times of those days was its composing room, where they were very nice and let me push buttons,'' she recalled much later. When she was older, she was often a guest at luncheons her father gave for figures in business, the professions or politics.         'Are You Sure of Your Facts?'         At home, Mr. Ochs was an indulgent yet perfectionist father. He strove to help his daughter buttress her opinions with facts. ''He always used to say to me: 'What is your authority? Where did you read it? Are you sure of your facts?' '' Mrs. Sulzberger recalled. Her father persuaded her to memorize a passage from Benjamin Franklin's ''Autobiography'' that described how Franklin had cultivated humility by avoiding dogmatic statements.         ''I think this helped me form the habit of qualifying my remarks; it's become almost second nature,'' she said in later years, ''and I've endeavored to hand this wisdom on to my children and grandchildren.''         Young Iphigene took to travel. Starting in 1900, she made trips every year with her parents, either to Europe or in the United States. These were usually planned learning experiences, adjuncts to school and college.         Her attendance at Dr. Sachs's School was followed by four years at the Benjamin-Dean School, from which, in 1910, she entered Barnard. ''I discovered that learning could be a joy,'' she recounted of her years on the Morningside Heights campus. ''I was absolutely happy.''         In her school years she worked in the Henry Street Settlement, the Jewish Big Sisters Program and the Cedar Knolls School for disturbed children, experiences that contributed to a lifelong social awareness.         At Barnard, she was attracted to journalism as a career and in her senior year took a course in the School of Journalism at Columbia. But Mr. Ochs held that a newspaper office was no place for women, especially not for his daughter, of whom he felt protective.         Publisher Gets a Son-in-Law         At college she ''very casually'' met Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the son of a cotton merchant; later she was reintroduced to him by her cousin Julius Ochs Adler, with whom Mr. Sulzberger was in military training at Plattsburgh, N.Y. The couple fell in love during Mr. Sulzberger's visits to the Ochs home on Lake George, but Mr. Sulzberger was obliged to propose twice before he was accepted - the successful occasion taking place, as she recalled with a twinkle, ''on the grounds of the local lunatic asylum'' in Spartanburg, S.C. He was stationed nearby as an Army lieutenant.         They were married at her parents' home in New York on Nov. 17, 1917, while Mr. Sulzberger was on a 10-day leave. Although Mr. Ochs first had reservations about his daughter's choice, ''within a few years his devotion to Arthur became boundless,'' she said.         World War I ended just as Mr. Sulzberger was to be sent abroad. So the couple settled in New York, where Mr. Sulzberger joined The Times.         The early years of Mrs. Sulzberger's marriage were given to making a home and rearing her children - Marian, born in 1918; Ruth, in 1921; Judith, in 1923, and Arthur Ochs, who was born in 1926. With her family well started, she began to take an active role in education and philanthropy.         Offstage Figure at Paper         In 1935, after the death of her father, Mrs. Sulzberger became a trustee under his will along with her husband and her cousin Julius Ochs Adler; her husband was elected president and publisher of The Times.         As the publisher's wife, Mrs. Sulzberger shared her husband's concerns and problems but remained steadfastly an offstage figure in the operation of the paper.         Her memoirs note, though, that at least one news beat - a scoop - came about ''because I had made eyes at a handsome young man in journalism school'' back in 1912 at Columbia. The man was Hollington Tong, who eventually became China's Ambassador to the United States.         The beat, on Aug. 23, 1944, was an account by James Reston of secret decisions by four major powers - the United States, the Soviet Union, Britain and China - on the future structure of the United Nations, including the concept of veto power in the Security Council.         Years later Mrs. Sulzberger revealed that the documents had come from the Chinese delegation, and Mr. Reston confirmed that they had been provided by a young diplomat, Joseph Ku, as a result of Mrs. Sulzberger's friendship with Ambassador Tong.         During World War II, she became director of special events for The Times, working with the promotion department. In this job, she furthered programs to assist the war effort, civilian defense, conservation and the use of The Times in schools and colleges.         Among other things, Mrs. Sulzberger suggested supplements and booklets for students on the war and on world affairs. She instituted forums for young people, which became a weekly event broadcast by WQXR, the radio station of The Times, and were later carried on television. She was also a tireless hostess at lectures that staff members of The Times gave for teachers, and she had a hand in Musical Talent in Our Schools, a project aimed at stimulating student musicians.         After the war, Mrs. Sulzberger quietly phased herself out of her Times job. Her children began to marry and establish homes of their own. Grandchildren were born. This all drew on her sense of family.         At the same time, she wanted to devote more attention to domestic concerns, including gardening. Before 1949, the Sulzbergers had a country home, called Hillandale, in White Plains. They sold it and bought a house near Stamford, Conn., which they also named Hillandale.         A Change of Generations         In 1957, the process of shifting daily management of The Times to younger shoulders began. Mr. Sulzberger, who had been president and publisher for 22 years, turned his presidency over to Orvil E. Dryfoos, then 44, husband of the Sulzbergers' daughter Marian. A next step was taken in 1961, when Mr. Sulzberger gave the publisher's post to Mr. Dryfoos and became chairman. He kept that position until his death, on Dec. 11, 1968.         Enfeebled by a stroke in his last years, Mr. Sulzberger relied almost completely on his wife as his contact with the world.         Meanwhile, in the spring of 1963, after a long newspaper strike in New York, Mr. Dryfoos died. Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, the youngest Sulzberger child and the only son, was named president and publisher.         Along with her son, Mrs. Sulzberger's three other children are now directors of the Times Company - Marian Sulzberger Heiskell, Ruth Sulzberger Holmberg, and Dr. Judith P. Sulzberger.         Mrs. Sulzberger herself was a director of the Times Company from 1917 until 1973, when she became a director emeritus. She was among those who voted to alter the company structure fundamentally, granting limited voting rights to the Class A stock and listing it on the American Stock Exchange. At her death she was a trustee of the stock trust established by her father that exercised effective control of the enterprise.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Sulzberger continued to live mostly in New York, at 1115 Fifth Avenue, staying in touch with her growing family and carrying on community and educational pursuits. She still traveled, went to the theater, ballet and concerts, and spent weekends in Stamford.         In 1982, when she turned 90, there were a number of celebrations. One was given by Barnard to honor her many contributions. Another was held at the New York Botanical Garden, where 165 friends and relatives put on skits, sang songs and poured forth affection.         Barbara Tuchman, in the foreword to ''Iphigene,'' notes that Mrs. Sulzberger was appointed by her father to the board of The Times when she was in her 20's and had the longest connection of anyone with the paper.         ''Through her, the continuity of family control from father to husband to son-in-law to son has been maintained for over 60 years and, through her, it will be passed on to the next generation - her grandchildren,'' Mrs. Tuchman wrote.         ''Through Iphigene's steady companionship and interest in their lives, her influence makes itself felt and will endure at the paper after the source is gone.''

She was 53 years old and lived in Washington.         Jean Galloway Bissell, a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, died of cancer Sunday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. She was 53 years old and lived in Washington.         President Ronald Reagan named Mrs. Bissell to the court in 1984.         Before her appointment to the Federal bench, she was the highest-ranking female executive among the 100 largest bank holding companies in the United States. She had been vice chairman and chief administrative officer of the South Carolina National Corporation and senior vice president and general counsel for South Carolina National Bank.         Judge Bissell, a graduate of the University of South Carolina and its law school, lectured at the university in the 1970's and early 1980's.         She is survived by her husband, Gregg C. Bissell; a stepson; a sister, Lila G. McMillan of Davidson, N.C., and a brother, Robert S. Galloway Jr., of Greenville, S.C.       
        Lillian Lidman Greneker, a sculptor and inventor who created movable mannequins, died on Jan. 28 at the nursing home of the Actors' Fund in Englewood, N.J. She was 95 years old.         Lillian Lidman Greneker, a sculptor and inventor who created movable mannequins, died on Jan. 28 at the nursing home of the Actors' Fund in Englewood, N.J. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Greneker was also an architect, contractor, bricklayer and corporation president. She received her architectural and building experience when she drew plans for and built four large stone houses and several small ones in Mount Kisco, N.Y.         Married to Claude P. Greneker, who was for many years publicity director for the Shubert theater interests, she became interested in mannequins when her husband wanted to use some in a theater stunt. To Mrs. Greneker's astonishment, she found that most mannequins were virtual statues and, in 1937, decided to make her own.         She began by forming heads and hands of cellophane and moved on to papier-mache, developing the flexible waist and adding mobility to the mannequins manufactured by the Greneker Corporation. She became president of the company.         The mannequins had carpenter-made joints and rubber ribs, for pliable body parts; horsehair wigs, and theatrical makeup. They appeared in the windows of Fifth Avenue stores like Bergdorf Goodman, Bonwit Teller and B. Altman.         Mrs. Greneker also created a series of thimble tools - paintbrushes, pencils, screwdrivers and the like - that could be attached to fingertips. They did not catch on.         In World War II, her factory in Pleasantville, N.Y., turned to military work. At the request of the United States Rubber Company, she invented and manufactured forms for self-sealing gasoline tanks for Navy warplanes.         After the war she turned to portrait sculpture, and her heads of actresses were widely exhibited.         There are no immediate survivors.

        Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal and family rivalries were critically acclaimed, died in her home here on Monday, her family announced today. She was 89 years old.         Rosamond Lehmann, whose novels of love, betrayal and family rivalries were critically acclaimed, died in her home here on Monday, her family announced today. She was 89 years old.         Miss Lehmann's first novel, ''Dusty Answer,'' won immediate fame for the young author when it was published in 1927. The novel, about a girl's development from childhood to maturity, was praised for its candor, wit and psychological insight as well as for its lyrical, sensuous writing.         She followed this with ''A Note of Music'' in 1930, ''Invitation to the Waltz'' in 1932, ''The Weather in the Streets'' in 1936, ''The Ballad and the Source'' in 1944 and ''The Gypsy's Baby,'' a collection of short stories, in 1946.         Two Sisters, One Lover         Her next book was ''The Echoing Grove,'' about the relationship between two sisters and the man who is the husband of one and the lover of the other.         With shifts of time and approach, the same incidents in the book are seen through the eyes of different people.         The book was written after the bitter breakup of Miss Lehmann's love affair with the poet Cecil Day Lewis, and critics said it carried clear traces of that time in her life.         The soft-voiced author grew up in a large, comfortable home at Bourne End on the Thames near London. She was educated at Cambridge University.         Married 2 Future Lords         She met her first husband, Walter Runciman, who was later to become Lord Runciman, at Cambridge University. They married in 1923 and were divorced in 1928.         Later in 1928, she married Wogan Philipps, the eldest son of the first Lord Milford, the shipping magnate. They had two children, Hugo and Sally. That marriage ended in divorce in 1944.         Her grief over the death of her daughter from polio led her to spiritualism for a time. For many of her later years she was vice president of the privately financed College of Psychic Studies in London.         Toward the end of Miss Lehmann's life, the Virago Press, which specializes in works by women, republished many of her novels, introducing her work to a new generation of readers.         Queen Elizabeth II awarded Miss Lehmann the Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1982.         She is survived by her son, Hugo.       
        Li Zhen, a veteran of the Long March and the first woman to become a general in China, died on March 11, China Daily said today. She was 83 years old.         Li Zhen, a veteran of the Long March and the first woman to become a general in China, died on March 11, China Daily said today. She was 83 years old.         President Yang Shangkun and military officers paid last respects to her on Thursday, the newspaper said. It did not give the cause of death.         Miss Li was promoted to major general in 1955 and until 1988 was the only woman serving as a general in the Chinese Army, China Daily said. The 3.5 million-member army is now believed to have four women who are generals.         Official biographies say she was born in Liuyang, in Hunan Province, and given away by her parents at age 6. In 1926, she fled her husband and joined the Communist Party. She took part in the 1927 Autumn Uprising in Hunan, Mao's first attempt to lead peasants in revolt against the authorities.         She took part in the 1934-35 Long March, the Red Army's epic escape from the ruling Nationalists to northern China, and held political positions in the army. The Communists defeated the Nationalists and took power in 1949.         She served as director of the Political Department of the Chinese military force in Korea during the Korean War.

She was 57 years old and lived in Westhampton Beach.         Jeanne Taylor Block, owner of the Westhampton Greenery, a Long Island gift shop, who was active in civic affairs, died of cancer on Saturday at Southampton Hospital. She was 57 years old and lived in Westhampton Beach.         Ms. Block was founder and co-chairwoman in the late 1980's of the Suffolk Safe Homes Coalition, a group dedicated to fighting drug abuse, and she served on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Safe Home Advisory Board.         She was a founder of the Westhampton Cultural Consortium, which raised funds for cultural activities on eastern Long Island. In 1975 and 1976 she founded Options for Women, a support group for women returning to work. She was also the founder and former president of the East End chapter of the National Organization for Women.         Ms. Block was a graduate of Mary Baldwin College in Staunton, Va., and received a master's degree from Long Island University's Southampton campus.         She is survived by her husband, Max; her mother, Agnes Grace Taylor of Gaithersburg, Md.; a brother, Bruce Taylor of Annapolis, Md.; a daughter, Lauren, of Manhattan, and a son, Jamie, of Westhampton Beach.       
        Josephine Blair Hughes, a super-saleswoman who sold high-fashion clothes to socially prominent women for four decades, died on Monday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 80 years old and had been bedridden for several years.         Josephine Blair Hughes, a super-saleswoman who sold high-fashion clothes to socially prominent women for four decades, died on Monday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 80 years old and had been bedridden for several years.         ''Jo Hughes was a dynamo, with the most fiercely loyal customers,'' said Lynn Manulis, president of Martha, where Miss Hughes spent the last seven years of her working life. ''Her girls, as she called them, wouldn't buy anything without her there to help and advise them.''         During her career, Jo Hughes worked at Hattie Carnegie, de Pinna, Bergdorf Goodman and Martha, as well as running her own shop for a time in a townhouse on East 56th Street.         Staged Fashion Shows         At Hattie Carnegie in the 1940's, she headed a department called Jeune Fille for 10 years, staging formal fashion shows each season. She continued the tradition of fashion shows, usually as charity benefits, when she went to Bergdorf Goodman in 1966, attracting customers like Doris Duke, Mary Lou Whitney and Mary Wells Lawrence.         ''All the important people came to her shows,'' recalled Andrew Goodman, the former owner of Bergdorf's. ''She had a volatile temper. She'd stop the show if someone was talking. But she was very good to her customers. If someone in Great Neck or somewhere had ordered a dress and needed it for a special party, she'd take a car and deliver it personally.''         Accompanied by a Dog         She was a familiar figure at designers' fashion shows, sitting in the front row with her Shih Tzu Tony on her lap. The dog went everywhere with her, friends recalled yesterday, even to restaurants like La Cote Basque and ''21,'' where he was checked in the coatroom.         Miss Hughes, who was born in Dallas, retired from Bergdorf's in 1978, then went back to work at Martha's in the early 80's until her health failed.         There are no survivors.       
        Barbara Baer Capitman, whose vision and persistence helped to turn a rundown area of Miami Beach into a vibrant Art Deco historic district, died of congestive heart failure on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 69 years old and suffered from diabetes and heart tremors.         Barbara Baer Capitman, whose vision and persistence helped to turn a rundown area of Miami Beach into a vibrant Art Deco historic district, died of congestive heart failure on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach. She was 69 years old and suffered from diabetes and heart tremors.         Ms. Capitman, who had lived in Miami since 1973, applied her talents to arouse renewed interest in 1920's and 1930's buildings throughout the country. Radio City Music Hall and the Chrysler Building are among the best examples of Art Deco.         ''My whole life had been Art Deco,'' she once said. ''I was born at the beginning of the period and grew up during the height of it. It's a thing of fate.''         Headed a Preservation League         In 1976 she helped to found the Miami Design Preservation League, which in 1979 won Federal historic designation for the South Beach district of Miami Beach. Her outspoken, unorthodox manner later led to her ouster from the group.         ''She would push and agitate and cause trouble until people wouldn't speak to her,'' said Michael Kinerk, chairman of the Art Deco Weekend festival. ''She was interested in results, not social sensitivities.''         The South Beach district is now on the National Register of Historic Places, the only 20th-century district on the register. That status brought Federal tax relief to what had been a depressed area. It is now enjoying an economic and cultural rebirth.         Chapters in Other Towns         Mrs. Capitman, president of the Art Deco Society of America, helped found chapters of the society in several cities, including New York, Washington, Chicago, San Francisco and Los Angeles. She was the author of ''Deco Delights'' (1989; E. P. Dutton).         She was born in Chicago and attended New York University. She later wrote advertising copy and was a reporter for The Atlantic City Daily World, which has ceased publication.         Her husband, William Capitman, died in 1975. He was a market researcher and economist and in later years a teacher at Florida International University.         Mrs. Capitman leaves two sons, Andrew W., who lives in London, and John A., who lives in Cambridge, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
        Helen Hoke, who wrote nearly 100 children's books and set up and ran children's book divisions in five publishing companies, died of bronchial pneumonia on Monday in a nursing home in Bethesda, Md. She was 86 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         Helen Hoke, who wrote nearly 100 children's books and set up and ran children's book divisions in five publishing companies, died of bronchial pneumonia on Monday in a nursing home in Bethesda, Md. She was 86 years old and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         Humor, natural history, the supernatural and witchcraft were the subjects of many of Ms. Hoke's books. She also specialized in anthologies of ghost stories, one of which she wrote with her grandson, Franklin Hoke.         Among her other books for young readers were ''The Horse That Took the Milk Around,'' ''Too Many Kittens,'' ''Factory Kitty'' and ''Grocery Kitty.''         In the late 1930's, Ms. Hoke inaugurated and managed children's book departments at several publishing houses, including Henry Holt, Reynal & Hitchcock and Julian Messer. In the 1940's, Ms. Hoke, whose first marriage, to John Hoke, had ended in divorce, married Franklin Watts, founder the New York publishing company that bears his name. She became the company's vice president and director of international projects.         She and her husband established Franklin Watts Ltd. in London in the 1960's, and Ms. Hoke worked there into the 1970's before returning to the United States. Ms. Hoke also organized Helen Hoke Associates, which represented authors, and oversaw publication of books from inception to marketing. Her son, John Hoke, said she was ''awfully good at finding new authors.''         In the 1970's she began naming her books with what she called ''Terrific Triple Titles.'' Among these books were, ''Witches, Witches, Witches,'' ''Jokes, Jokes, Jokes'' and ''Nurses, Nurses, Nurses,'' an anthology of short stories, poems and excerpts from biographies and novels.         Jean Vestal of Franklin Watts said one of Ms. Hoke's contributions to children's book publishing was her early support of the Bologna International Children's Book Fair in Italy, which has become an important element in the industry.         Ms. Hoke and her son, a photographer and writer, wrote ''Music Boxes: Their Lore and Lure'' in 1957. It was her 32d book and her first nonfiction work.         Ms. Hoke was also executive director of the Julia Ellsworth Ford Foundation, which conducted annual children's book competitions.         Surviving are her son, who lives in Bethesda, and four grandchildren.       
        Paule Marie Boulin, for more than 30 years the president of the New York chapter of the Conseil National des Femmes Francaises aux Etats-Unis, a Paris-based cultural group formed to strengthen Franch-American relations, died of a heart attack on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived in         Paule Marie Boulin, for more than 30 years the president of the New York chapter of the Conseil National des Femmes Francaises aux Etats-Unis, a Paris-based cultural group formed to strengthen Franch-American relations, died of a heart attack on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She was the president and owner of the Hasler-Tel Company, a Swiss-based maker of precision instruments, which she took over after the death of her husband, Camille H. Boulin.         Mrs. Boulin, who was born in France, was educated at the Legion of Honor School in Paris and in England.         She is survived by two daughters, Marie-Claude Solvay, who lives in Belgium, and Anne Robertshaw of Greensburg, Pa., and nine grandchildren.       
        Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan.         Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         During her 20 years as curator, Dr. Szladits scoured England to bargain for diaries and first editions; in this country, she cajoled American authors to think of the Berg first when parting with their papers. In the faintly discernible accent of her native Hungary, she was fond of joking, though without affectation, ''Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.''         Everyone from the president of the library to her assistants called Dr. Szladits by her first name. She, in turn, was on a first-name basis with her precious manuscripts. When she spoke of ''Tom,'' she meant T. S. Eliot, of ''Wystan,'' W. H. Auden, and of ''Virginia,'' her greatly admired diarist and novelist, Virginia Woolf.         Sitting in her cramped office off the Berg's reading and exhibition rooms on the third floor of the library on Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, Dr. Szladits liked to reach for the exact quotation from one of the tens of thousands of documents in the collection.         'We Protect the Written Word'         Last year, when she mounted a show on diarists, it included 50 of her famous authors, including James Boswell, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville and, of course, Virginia Woolf, whose manuscripts in 33 volumes are one of the prizes in the Berg. She liked to quote ''Virginia,'' who said, ''Fortunately, intellect has no gender.''         Dr. Szladits considered the Berg not a musty repository of the past but a working collection that was used by biographers from all over the world.         ''We protect the written word at the Berg,'' she told Whitney Balliett, who wrote a profile about her in The New Yorker on Dec. 31, 1984 - the first such article about a librarian in the magazine's history. ''It is a research collection, not a museum. It has to be used. It is alive. My role at the Berg is to stand still and allow the collection to grow. In fact, I try to make time itself stand still here. I try to create quiet and the timelessness that allows for the pursuit of truth.''         Auden's Handwritten Notebooks         Born in Budapest, she immigrated to the United States in 1950 and became a naturalized citizen in 1956. After receiving her doctorate in Hungary, she did postgraduate work at the Sorbonne in Paris, University College in London and Columbia University. She joined the New York Public Library in 1955 and was appointed curator of the Berg Collection in 1969.         Among her most significant acquisitions were Auden's handwritten notebooks. She also established or expanded files on Conrad Aiken, H. G. Wells, Muriel Rukeyser, Evelyn Waugh, Samuel Beckett, William Faulkner, May Sarton, Washington Irving, Walt Whitman and Oliver Wendell Holmes.         ''I am buying in eternity,'' Dr. Szladits once remarked.         Paul Fasana, the library's Andrew W. Mellon Director of Research Libraries, said yesterday: ''Lola was an original. Her standards, for herself and others, were high and at times unattainable. Her dedication to the ideal of literary scholarship was fierce. But she was also loving and human.''         Dr. Szladits was married to Charles Szladits, a professor of law at Columbia University, who died in 1986.         A memorial service will be held on May 5 in the Celeste Bartos Forum of the library, and a book fund in her name will be established for the Berg Collection.       
        Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Paulette Goddard, a vivacious film actress adept at playing both sophisticated comedy and sultry melodrama, died of heart failure yesterday at her home outside the Swiss resort of Ronco overlooking Lake Maggiore. Her age was usually listed as 78.         Miss Goddard, a Hollywood star of the 1930's, 40's and 50's, was also publicized for her friendships with many notable figures; her marriages to Charles Chaplin, Burgess Meredith and Erich Maria Remarque, and her glamorous life style.         The actress, a former fashion model and showgirl, made her first major screen appearance in 1936 as a waterfront waif befriended by a forsaken assembly-line worker (played by Chaplin) in ''Modern Times,'' the last silent comedy feature.         Hollywood quickly took notice, and Miss Goddard earned leading comedy roles as an adventuress in ''The Young in Heart,'' as a battling wife seeking a Reno divorce in ''The Women,'' and as Bob Hope's pert romantic foil in ''The Cat and the Canary'' and ''The Ghost Breakers.''         Other early roles included a put-upon laundress in Mr. Chaplin's ''Great Dictator'' (1940); Fred Astaire's partner in ''Second Chorus'' (1941), in which she gamely struggled to keep up with him in the dance ''I Ain't Hep to That Step, But I'll Dig It,'' and a lusty Southern belle singing a suggestive sea chanty to a party of prudes in the 1942 adventure ''Reap the Wild Wind.''         Runner-Up for Scarlett         The last of these roles was a consolation prize for the major disappointment of her acting career: losing the coveted part of Scarlett O'Hara to Vivien Leigh in the final round of the ''Gone With the Wind'' competition. At the time Miss Goddard said she ''cried her eyes out,'' but years later she said she recalled the episode as only ''like a game.''         Miss Goddard, an energetic and articulate woman, was a close friend of a wide range of artists, including the composer George Gershwin, the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera and the artist Andy Warhol. She was wealthy, both from her Hollywood salaries and her husbands, but in later years she sold many costly artworks at auction, including her collection of Impressionist art, which was sold in 1979 for $2.9 million.         At the time, she said her reason for selling was no secret. ''It's because I don't want the responsibility any longer for this movable feast,'' she said, explaining that she was tired of carting the art from Switzerland to California and New York when she changed residences. Coincidentally, more than 20 items in her extensive jewelry collection are being sold today as part of an auction at Sotheby's in New York.         Tributes for Giving and Acting         The actress was known for her philanthropies as well as her art and gems. In the last 12 years, she awarded more than $3 million in scholarships to 300 theater and film students at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts. She had previously given the university the diaries, manuscripts and personal library of Remarque, who died in 1970. In a statement yesterday, John Brademas, the university's president, hailed the ''vision and continued generosity'' of ''this remarkable actress.''         Miss Goddard's acting also inspired tributes. The writer Robert Benchley praised her as ''a woman who could charm a rock,'' and Ray Milland, a frequent co-star, hailed her as ''the most honest actress I ever knew; she gave it all she had.''         A celebrated Goddard role was a witty social-climber in ''The Diary of a Chambermaid,'' directed in 1946 by Jean Renoir. She said she preferred such roles to ''sweet, boring'' parts and that moviegoers also favored ''adventuruous characters because 90 percent of the public is good.'' When an interviewer called her glamorous, she defined glamour as ''a spell of charm,'' adding: ''I don't want to be a phony. I want to be real.''         The actress could also be blunt. When several of her friends were accused of being Communists by members of Congress in 1947, she remarked, ''If anyone accuses me of being a Communist, I'll hit them with my diamond bracelets.''         Powers Model and Ziegfeld Girl         Paulette Goddard was born Marion Levy in Great Neck, L.I., on June 3, 1911, according to major film refererence works. However, news agencies yesterday quoted municipal employees in Ronco as giving her birth year of record as 1905. Her parents separated in her childhood, and she later chose her mother's maiden name, Goddard.         She left school early and became a Powers model and then a Ziegfeld Girl. She was briefly married to Edgar W. James, a lumber industrialist, and soon sought fame in Hollywood. She played a series of chorus and other bit parts, joined the Hal Roach stock company and met Mr. Chaplin, from whom she became inseparable.         Miss Goddard's later film roles included ''North West Mounted Police'' (1940), ''Nothing But the Truth'' (1941), ''So Proudly We Hail'' (1943), ''Kitty'' (1946), ''Unconquered'' (1947) and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1949).         Her roles in the 1950's were disappointing, and, except for a 1964 Italian film, ''Time of Indifference,'' she lived in retirement with Mr. Remarque from the time of her marriage to the novelist in 1958 until his death. Her other marriges ended in divorce.         There are no immediate survivors.

At the bureau she helped revise the cyclical economic indicators used by the United States Department of Commerce and the procedure for combining the indicators into indexes of economic activity. She was also largely responsible for constructing the Growth Cycle Program, a method of determining turning points in the economy.         From 1977 to 1986 Dr. Boschan was a vice president of Citibank, which took over the economic data bank, now known as Citibase, from the National Bureau.

        Pauline Frederick, a longtime radio and television news analyst of world affairs, died of a heart attack on Wednesday at Lake Forest (Ill.) Hospital while visiting relatives. She was 84 years old and lived in Sarasota, Fla.         Pauline Frederick, a longtime radio and television news analyst of world affairs, died of a heart attack on Wednesday at Lake Forest (Ill.) Hospital while visiting relatives. She was 84 years old and lived in Sarasota, Fla.         Miss Frederick achieved eminence when her field was virtually closed to women. She was NBC's correspondent at the United Nations for 21 years, and earlier covered it for ABC. After retiring from NBC in 1974, she commented on foreign affairs for National Public Radio.         At all three networks, Miss Frederick had her own news programs, and she reported on political conventions, the United Nations and world affairs.         She covered the Nuremberg trials of Nazi war criminals, conferences of the Big Four foreign ministers in New York and Paris, and China's entrance into the United Nations. She also reported on the Korean War, wars in the Middle East, efforts by the United Nations to restore peace in the Congo and on the Cuban missile affair.         'I Think News Is News'         Early in her career, Miss Frederick was assigned to cover what were regarded as women's stories.         ''I never believed there was such a thing as 'women's news,' '' she said in 1956. ''I think news is news; that's all. One of my first assignments was covering a forum for women on the topic 'How to Get a Husband.' I don't think I learned anything from it, and I don't think the audience did either.''         Soon afterward, though, came a turning point. In an emergency, she was asked to broadcast a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers in New York, and afterward specialized in international affairs and politics. In 1951, ABC's biography of Miss Frederick noted that she ''holds the unique distinction of being the only woman network news analyst and diplomatic correspondent in American radio.''         Miss Frederick was born in Gallitzin, Pa., and grew up in Harrisburg, where she reported for several newspapers while still in high school. She considered law as a career before deciding to pursue journalism.         She majored in political science at American Unversity in Washington, where she received a master's degree in international law.         Despite her opinions on so-called women's news, she hit upon an effective way, given the times, to break into journalism: interviewing the wives of diplomats in Washington. She sold the articles to The Washington Star.         Writing and Radio Interviews         Miss Frederick wrote for the United States Daily, a predecessor of U.S. News and World Report, covering the State, War and Navy Departments. Then she wrote for the North American Newspaper Alliance, also doing occasional radio interviews for NBC before becoming a war correspondent for the newspaper alliance in 1945.         Miss Frederick made her first network broadcast from Washington in 1939, her first overseas broadcast from China in 1945, and her first network television broadcast from the national political conventions in Philadelphia in 1948.         In 1976, she became the first woman to moderate a Presidential debate, between Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter.         She was also the first woman to be elected president of the United Nations Correspondents Association. Her many honors included a Paul White Award from the Radio-Television News Directors' Association in 1980 and a George Foster Peabody Award in 1954. In 1975, she was named to the Hall of Fame of Sigma Delta Chi, the journalists' society. She received honorary doctorate degrees in journalism, law and the humanities from 23 colleges and universities.         Miss Frederick was married to Charles Robbins, a former reporter and managing editor at The Wall Street Journal, who died in August. There are no immediate survivors.

After moving to Hollywood in 1962, Ms. Ireland appeared in many television series, including ''Ben Casey,'' ''Daniel Boone,'' ''Mannix,'' ''Star Trek,'' ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' and ''Shane.'' She and Mr. McCallum were divorced in 1967 and a year later she married Charles Bronson. They starred together in many action-adventure movies, including ''Love and Bullets,'' ''Noon Till Three'' and ''Death Wish II.''         Coping With Adversity         Ms. Ireland also wrote of coping with adversity in her 1989 book, ''Life Lines.'' In it, she discussed her father's debilitating aphasia and the drug abuse of her adopted son, Jason, who subsequently died of a lethal drug combination. At the time of her death she was writing a third book, called ''Life Times.''         Ms. Ireland is survived by her husband; her parents, Jack and Dorothy Ireland, of Sussex, England; her brother, John Ireland, of Toronto, Ontario, and six children: Paul and Valentine McCallum; Suzanne, Tony and Zulieka Bronson, and Katrina Holden, all of Los Angeles.

She was 90 years old and lived in Bal Harbour, Fla. She had been in a coma for 10 days, the family said.         In 1935, in the depths of the Depression, she and her husband, Al Tisch, established two boys' camps, Laurel and Lincoln, in the Poconos. Their teen-aged sons, Laurence and Preston, worked summers at the camps. In 1946, the father, then a clothing manufacturer, advanced money for the sons, fresh out of wartime service, to go into business for themselves.         They bought a resort hotel, Laurel-in-the-Pines, at Lakewood, N.J., where their mother became the hostess. It was the first of many hotels that the Tisch brothers acquired and that their mother helped to run.

        Eleanor Clark French, a writer, editor and former vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, died on Monday in Paoli, Pa. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Eleanor Clark French, a writer, editor and former vice chairwoman of the New York State Democratic Committee, died on Monday in Paoli, Pa. She was 81 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her stepson, John French Jr., said she had suffered a stroke while visiting relatives in the Philadelphia area.         Mrs. French was born into Philadelphia's Main Line society but spent most of her adult life in New York, where she was active in political causes and civic affairs. Although she had not held party office in the last decade, she remained influential in Democratic affairs until her death.         Last year Mrs. French devoted much of her energy to securing revision of the New York City Charter. As chairwoman of the charter committee of the Women's City Club, she lobbied for the changes that were adopted by the voters last November.         Helped Nazi Victims         Earlier this year the Unitarian Universalist Services Committee honored Mrs. French for her work in the aftermath of World War II, when she directed two rest homes in France operated by the church organization for survivors of Nazi concentration camps.         Mrs. French was most prominently in the public eye in 1964 when she tried unsuccessfully to wrest a seat in the House of Representatives from John V. Lindsay. As the Democratic-Liberal candidate in the ''Silk Stocking'' district on Manhattan's East Side, she waged a vigorous campaign but lost, receiving less than 25 percent of the vote.         Two years earlier she had been appointed New York City's first Commissioner to the United Nations, a post she held until her race for Congress.         Mrs. French was a delegate to five Democratic National Conventions, from 1964 through 1980, and was vice chairwoman of the state party from 1957 to 1960.         She attended the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., which she found progressive. But at 14, as the president of her class, she complained to the headmistress that because the school was all white she was not being prepared for the world in which she was going to live. She quoted the reply: ''My dear Ellie, we're not giving you the opportunity to make friends with Democrats either.''         A Stint as a Teacher         Mrs. French, who later became a member of the New York City Commission on Intergroup Relations, now the Commission on Human Rights, studied at the Sorbonne and at Harvard and Columbia.         In 1932, after her father, Herbert Lincoln Clark, a stockbroker, lost a fortune in the Depression, she returned to Shipley as a teacher and later became a supervisor at the Episcopal School in Overbrook, Pa.         In World War II she served in the Office of Inter-American Affairs in Washington. In 1949, after returning from France, she joined the staff of The New York Times and was named women's news editor. She resigned in 1955 to become more active in politics, and the following year she ran for the State Senate but lost. In 1957 she was appointed vice chairwoman of the Democratic State Committee to fill a vacancy, and in 1958 she won election to the post.         But two years later, in a split with the party's top leadership, she was out, charging that she and other women had not been given a real voice in Democratic affairs in the state.         Family members said yesterday that last Thursday Mrs. French had been pleased to stand in line for two hours for the chance to meet Nelson Mandela during his New York visit.         Mrs. French's husband, John, whom she married in 1950, died in 1984. Surviving are two stepsons, John Jr., of Manhattan, and Roberts, of Amherst, Mass., and a stepdaughter, Mary Moore of Cheyenne, Wyo.         A funeral service will be held on Monday at 11 A.M. at All Souls Unitarian Church, Lexington Aveue at 80th Street.

She was a past president of the Women's Medical Society of New York State which named her Woman of the Year in 1965.         In 1931, Dr. Miller bought a former schoolhouse in Kinnelon for a retreat. In 1965, she built a medical center on the site to attract young doctors.         Dr. Miller was born in Corvallis, Ore. She graduated from Oregon State University in 1917 and the Oregon Medical School in 1926. In the early 30's, the New York City Health Department selected her to establish one of the first prenatal clinics in a settlement house.         There are no immediate survivors.

        Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         She had been suffering from cancer, said her son, Timothy.         Known as Lois Moran throughout her career, she made her first film, in France, at the age of 14 and gained fame the next year when she starred with Ronald Colman in Samuel Goldwyn's ''Stella Dallas.''         In her film career of more than two dozen movies, Miss Moran combined an artist's versatility with romantic appeal. F. Scott Fitzgerald was said to have based the character Rosemary on her when he wrote ''Tender Is the Night.''         By the age of 20, she had already made four movies for Fox Studios, where she was under long-term contract. But she played leading roles for other studios as well, among them parts in ''Padlocked,'' ''Reckless Lady,'' ''The Road to Mandalay,'' ''Don't Marry,'' ''Mammy'' and ''The Men in Her Life.''         In the early 1930's, after studying singing, she moved to musicals, making her Broadway debut in ''This Is New York.'' She was the leading woman in George Kaufman's satire ''Of Thee I Sing'' and also starred for four years in ''Let 'Em Eat Cake.''         But in 1935, after marrying Col. Clarence M. Young, an Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Miss Moran slowed the pace of her career. She retired permanently in 1954 after co-starring with Robert Preston in the television series ''Waterfront.''         Miss Moran was born in Pittsburgh but, while still an infant, moved to Paris with her mother, a physician's widow. There she joined the Paris Opera Corps de Ballet, where she was spotted by a director who cast her in a movie.         She returned to the United States and starred as Belle Bennett's daughter in ''Stella Dallas.'' After that film's success, the offers poured in. She did one or two films at each of the major studios before signing her long-term contract with Fox.         For some time after her retirement, she and her husband lived and traveled throughout the country. But when Mr. Young retired as a vice president of Pan American World Airways more than 20 years ago, the couple moved permanently to Sedona.         Miss Moran's only immediate survivor is her son, who lives in Sedona.

She was 99 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Ann Ivey, a colleague.         For 20 years, starting in 1946, Mrs. Olmsted led the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom, formed at The Hague in 1915. She was also active in the women's suffrage movement from the early 1900's, and later in life became active in the civil rights movement.         In 1961 she began a series of exchange seminars between the United States section of the league and the Women's Committee of the Soviet Union, a group sponsored by the Soviet Government.         Two months ago Mrs. Olmsted received a lifetime achievement award from the City of Philadelphia, and in 1986 she received the women's league's Peace and Freedom Award.         She was born in Glenolden, Pa., and graduated from Smith College in 1912. In World War I she was a social worker with the Y.W.C.A. in France and Germany. In France she met Jane Addams, winner of the Nobel Peace Prize and first president of the women's league, whose example inspired Mrs. Olmsted to work for peace.         Her husband, Allen Olmsted, a Pennsylvania judge who was a founder of the American Civil Liberties Union, died in 1976.         Mrs. Olmsted is survived by a son, Anthony, of West Goshen, Pa.; a daughter, Enid Burke, of Springfield, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and two great- grandchildren.

        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died yesterday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, had accompanied her to the hospital.         The singer left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had a fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in-promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century by the languorous sexuality of her throaty voice as well as by the directness of her personality. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical ''Hello Dolly!,'' which she played on Broadway from 1967 to 1969.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' Miss Bailey once remarked in attempting to describe herself. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune.''         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.''         Won Award in 1946         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.'' She won the Donaldson Award as the most promising new performer of 1946 for her performance. Later Broadway roles included ''Arms and the Girl,'' ''Bless You All'' and ''House of Flowers.''         In addition to ''Carmen Jones'' and ''Porgy and Bess,'' she appeared in the films ''Variety Girl,'' ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''Father's Day,'' ''That Certain Feeling'' and ''St. Louis Blues.''         From 1946 on she was a top attraction in night clubs and variety houses and on television in the United States and Britain. Her act changed relatively little from year to year, and always retained some early successes, including ''From Mouton to Muskrat to Mink'' -a perennial favorite.         Miss Bailey's received a special Tony Award in 1968 for her performance in ''Helly, Dolly!''         Besides Mr. Bellson, Miss Bailey is survived by a son, Tony, and a daughter, Dee Dee, both of Los Angeles, and by two sisters, Eura Robinson and Virgie Murray, both of Philadelphia.         Correction:  August 25, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary of Pearl Bailey in some editions last Saturday and some on Sunday referred incompletely to her co-stars in the Broadway musical ''Hello, Dolly!,'' and a correction in this space on Tuesday misidentified the actor with whom she first performed the role. Cab Calloway starred with Miss Bailey in a 1967 staging of the musical, and Billy Daniels appeared with her in a 1975 revival.       
        Bess Goodykoontz, an educator who served as Assistant United States Commissioner of Education in the 1930's and 40's, died Sunday at her daughter's home in South Newfane, Vt. She was 95 years old.         Bess Goodykoontz, an educator who served as Assistant United States Commissioner of Education in the 1930's and 40's, died Sunday at her daughter's home in South Newfane, Vt. She was 95 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said.         A graduate of the University of Iowa, Dr. Goodykoontz taught at rural schools in Iowa and Wisconsin and at the University of Pittsburgh before being appointed to the No. 2 position in the Bureau of Education, as it was known. She served as Assistant Commissioner from 1929 to 1946, was director of the elementary education division from 1946 to 1949 and was then named Associate Commissioner of Education. In 1951 she became director of comparative education. She was later in charge of international education relations.         Saw Use for 'Talkies'         Dr. Goodykoontz was with the Office of Education, a precursor to a Cabinet department, in the crisis brought on by the Great Depression and later by World War II. In 1932 she advocated use of ''talkies'' in the classroom, writing, ''The sound film appears to be a particularly effective method of instruction for backward children.''         In 1935 she called for an increase in education programs for people mired in the Depression, and early in World War II she advocated day care so mothers could work in arms plants.         She was a member and official of many education organizations and was vice president of the United States National Committee for Childhood Education and of the World Organization for Childhood Education.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen Darrow of South Newfane, and three grandchildren.       
        Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died on Friday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu,         Pearl Bailey, the entertainer whose distinctive singing style was enhanced by her mischievous witticisms and warm personality, died on Friday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after collapsing at a hotel where she had been staying. She was 72 years old and lived in Lake Havasu, Ariz.         The cause of death was not immediately known. Miss Bailey had a long history of heart ailments and was recovering from knee surgery. A spokeswoman for the hospital, Elizabeth Samuels, said an autopsy was being conducted to determine the cause of death.         In a stage career that began in 1933 when she won first prize at an amateur night in Philadelphia and reached a peak with her 1967 starring role on Broadway in an all-black version of the musical ''Hello, Dolly!'' with Cab Calloway, Miss Bailey said she thought of herself as a singer and not an actress.         'I Tell Stories to Music'         ''I'm not a comedienne,'' she told an interviewer some years ago. ''I call myself a humorist. I tell stories to music and, thank God, in tune. I laugh at people who call me an actress.''         Her trademark was a warm, lusty singing voice accompanied by an easy smile and elegant gestures that charmed audiences and translated smoothly from the nightclub stage and Broadway to film and television.         On stage her ample figure, often swathed in fur and sparkling with rhinestones and jewels, was a magnet for audience attention as she tossed off a ballad in throwaway style.         ''I've lost one of the greatest friends I've ever had in my life,'' Mr. Calloway said after learning of Miss Bailey's death. ''I've lost a co-worker and a wonderful person.''         Carol Channing, who had created the role of Dolly Gallagher Levi in the musical three years before Miss Bailey undertook the part, said: ''The entertainment world has lost one of its most creative performers of our time. Her talent was unique and enduring.''         Miss Bailey's husband, the jazz drummer Louis Bellson, to whom she was married for 38 years and who went with her to the hospital on Friday, said simply, ''I've lost my best friend.''         The singer had left the hospital on July 30 after undergoing surgery to replace her arthritic left knee with a metal and plastic joint. She was staying at a local hotel during a series of physical-therapy sessions. Her two sisters live in Philadelphia.         Mr. Bellson said they had been planning a visit to New York, where Miss Bailey was to give an address at the United Nations on Aug. 24.         Distinctive Vocal Timbre         ''If I just sang a song,'' Pearl Bailey once said when she had been drawn into an analysis of her performing style, ''it would mean nothing.'' That is a debatable point. Her voice had a distinctively warm timbre and her natural vocal inflection was filled with fascinating colors and highlights.         Like Jelly Roll Morton, the great jazz pianist, who was fond of saying that he changed everything he played ''to Jelly Roll'' (as, in truth, he did), everything Miss Bailey sang came out ''Pearlie Mae style.'' This included the so-called risque songs that were a staple of her nightclub acts or the songs she sang in ''Hello, Dolly!'' ''House of Flowers,'' ''St. Louis Woman'' and other Broadway musicals.         In truth, Miss Bailey never ''just sang a song.'' The stage Pearl Bailey was a close reflection of the private Pearl Bailey.         She was a trouper in the old theatrical sense. She had fierce pride in the level and consistency of her performance, no matter what the circumstances. She was disturbed to see this quality going out of show business, and she sometimes talked of forming a troupe - she still thought of it as a vaudeville act long after there were no more vaudeville theaters where it could play - through which she could instill the old discipline of trouping in promising young performers.         Tall, buxom, exuberant and handsome, Pearl Bailey enraptured theater and nightclub audiences for a quarter-century. Her talents as an actress and singer were perhaps best blended in her role as the bumptious amateur matchmaker in ''Hello, Dolly!'' which she played on Broadway for two years.         At one point the show went to Washington and President Lyndon B. Johnson attended a performance. Waving to him at the curtain, Miss Bailey brought the house down with the remark, ''I didn't know this child was going to show up.'' Then she brought him on stage for a sing-along chorus of the title song. It was probably the first time that a President of the United States served as a chorus boy.         Best in Nightclubs         In films, she was celebrated chiefly for two roles - Maria in ''Porgy and Bess'' and Frankie, a roadhouse girl, in ''Carmen Jones.'' But Miss Bailey's gifts were best savored in the nightclub, where she was able to establish a marked degree of intimacy with her audiences. There her digressions enhanced her songs.         Among her best-known songs were ''Tired,'' ''Two to Tango,'' ''Birth of the Blues,'' ''Toot Toot Tootsie, Goodbye,'' ''Row, Row, Row,'' ''That's Good Enough for Me'' and ''15 Years.''         Miss Bailey had a bluntness that some found disconcerting. Once President Richard M. Nixon invited her to the White House and asked her to become his ''ambassador of love.'' In her account of the colloquy that followed, Miss Bailey reported: ''I don't join anything. I'm not a member of anything and I don't pay dues.         ''I told Mr. Nixon I will do anything for my country. But no one can use me. I don't want to be used. And I said to him that when I go out among the people and they see me, they'll say, 'My lord, they sent Pearlie Mae,' and they'll think, 'Somebody must be trying to do something.' ''         Criticism on All-Black Casting         Miss Bailey was equally straightforward with those who criticized her because the cast of her ''Hello, Dolly!'' was all black. ''I wasn't hired to do an all-colored 'Dolly.' It was just one of those things,'' she said.         ''A lot of talented people showed up and what's wrong with them having a job? What is good for the Negro? What is good for the Negro is good for everyman. Every man has a place in this world, but no man has a right to designate that place.''         Although Miss Bailey was sometimes bewildering in her conversation, there was rarely any doubt about her warmth. ''I love people; they can have everything I've got,'' she said. At the same time, she disliked ''all this kissin' and greeting in the theater.''         Part Indian Ancestry         Pearl Mae Bailey was born on March 29, 1918, in Newport News, Va., the youngest of four children of black and Creek Indian ancestry. Miss Bailey's parents were divorced when she was a child, and her mother remarried and moved to Philadelphia.         Her only brother, Willie, was a tap-dancing protege of Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and performed for a time as Bill Bailey. He once chased her from the theater where he was rehearsing, and to get back at him, Miss Bailey, at 15, entered an amateur contest. She sang ''Poor Butterfly'' and ''Talk of the Town'' and did a tap dance, and won first prize.         For several winters she worked for $15 a week and tips as a singer and dancer in small clubs in the coal-mining section of Pennsylvania. One summer, on a visit to Washington, Miss Bailey devised a dance act that won a $12 prize and led to other engagements.         Her first New York appearance was in 1941 at the Village Vanguard. She sang briefly with the Sunset Royal Orchestra and with Count Basie's band, and for two years, 1943-44, toured with Cootie Williams's band. In 1944 she was booked into the Blue Angel, a prestigious New York supper club, for two weeks.         Her performance, particularly her amusing version of ''Tired,'' won glowing notices, and she stayed at the club for eight months. Columbia Records put her under contract - ''Tired'' was one of her first releases - and she made a theater tour with Cab Calloway's orchestra.         New York theatergoers first saw her in 1946, in the musical comedy ''St. Louis Woman,'' singing ''Legalize My Name'' and ''A Woman's Prerogative.''

Funeral arrangements had not been made yesterday, but Miss Bailey's road manager, E. B. Smith, said she would be buried in Philadelphia, next to family members.

        Martha Dodd Stern, an American author who in the 1930's and 1940's wrote popular books about Nazi Germany and later fled behind the Iron Curtain when she and her wealthy husband, Alfred K. Stern, were accused of being Soviet spies, died on Aug. 10 in Prague, friends reported. She was 82 years old and had lived in the         Martha Dodd Stern, an American author who in the 1930's and 1940's wrote popular books about Nazi Germany and later fled behind the Iron Curtain when she and her wealthy husband, Alfred K. Stern, were accused of being Soviet spies, died on Aug. 10 in Prague, friends reported. She was 82 years old and had lived in the Czechoslovak capital for more than three decades.         Victor Rabinowitz, a New York lawyer who received word of Mrs. Stern's death, said that although the cause of her death was not reported, she had recently suffered an intestinal blockage.         Martha Dodd came to public attention in 1939 when her first book, ''Through Embassy Eyes,'' was published. It told of her four years in Berlin beginning in 1933 when her father, William E. Dodd, was appointed by President Franklin D. Roosevelt as Ambassador to Germany after Adolf Hitler's rise to power.         Then in her 20's, she was at first favorably impressed by the new leaders of Nazi Germany but her later disillusionment was reflected in her book.         In 1938, a year after her return to the United States, she married Mr. Stern, a former chairman of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York who had inherited through an earlier marriage part of the fortune of Julius Rosenwald, the Chicago philanthropist.         In 1941, after her father's death and nine months before the United States entered World War II, Mrs. Stern and her brother, William E. Dodd Jr., published the Ambassador's diaries. Critics said that by failing to edit the comments of Germans who were opposed to Hitler they endangered the anti-Nazi underground.         Subject of McCarthy Investigation         In the last days of the war Mrs. Stern published ''Sowing the Wind,'' a novel that dealt with the moral degradation of Germans under the Nazi hierarchy.         In the early 1950's she and Mr. Stern became persistent targets of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy in his anti-Communist investigations. The couple moved to Mexico City in 1953, and four years later Boris Morros, an American counterspy, testified to the House Committee on Un-American Activities that the Sternses were part of a Soviet spy network.         When they were indicted on espionage charges in 1957, the couple fled to Prague, where they settled. They later traveled to the Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries and to Cuba but never returned to the United States. Mrs. Stern did translations of books and articles. Mr. Stern died four years ago at the age of 88.         Mrs. Stern is survived by a son, Robert, who lives in Prague.       
        Lucy Goldschmidt Moses, a philanthropist, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 103 years old.         Lucy Goldschmidt Moses, a philanthropist, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 103 years old.         Mrs. Moses's philanthropic interests largely reflected the activities of her husband, Henry L. Moses, whom she married in 1914. A lawyer and financier, he was president of Montefiore Hospital for many years. After his death in 1961 she established the Henry L. Moses Research Institute at the hospital.         Mrs. Moses was born in New York. As a child she was accompanied by a governess when she went skating in Central Park or took walks. Later, as a young woman beginning a 40-year career as a volunteer in settlement-house work, she cared for the children of poor families.         Center at Mt. Sinai         Beginning in the 20's, she also worked as a volunteer at Montefiore, first in the wards and later in the epilepsy clinic.         She donated tens of millions of dollars to philanthropy, a major part going to the medical field. In addition to gifts to Montefiore, she established the Lucy G. Moses Cardiothoracic Center, an advanced research and training institution, at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, She also contributed to health programs in Burma, Israel and South Korea. After her husband's death, she became president of the Henry and Lucy Moses Fund, which the couple established in 1942 to support education, music and the arts.         Mrs. Moses contributed for projects like the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies and providing a wheelchair lift and other equipment for the handicapped at Carnegie Hall. She donated to New York University for studies in Egyptian art. Columbia University also received gifts for its housing program and a study hall in the Law School.         Mrs. Moses was a leading supporter of the opera and Lincoln Center. In 1983 she received the first Frederick Law Olmstead award for helping to restore the Bow Bridge over the Central Park Lake. ''They called me the Florence Nightingale of the trees,'' Mrs. Moses said at the time. ''I've also been called Mother of the Park. I've had such fun.''         Surviving are a daughter, Nancy Osserman of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and six grandchildren.         A service will be held on Monday at 2 P.M. at Temple Emanu-El, Fifth Avenue and 65th Street.

She also wrote a nationally syndicated newspaper column, ''Special Diets/Nutrition Hotline''; appeared on radio and television and contributed articles on food and health to national magazines.         She was a member of the Authors League of America, the National Federation of Press Women and the Newspaper Food Editors and Writers Association. Mrs. Roth was born in Haverstraw, N.Y., and graduated from Thomas A. Edison College in Princeton, N.J. She received an M.S. degree in biochemistry and clinical nutrition from the University of Bridgeport.         She is survived by her husband, Frederick; a daughter, Nancy Bergen of Nashville; her father, Harry Spiewk of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
        Clara Beyer, an influential New Deal administrator who served as a confidential aide to Frances Perkins during her 12 years as Secretary of Labor, died Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 98 years old.         Clara Beyer, an influential New Deal administrator who served as a confidential aide to Frances Perkins during her 12 years as Secretary of Labor, died Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 98 years old.         A family spokesman said she died of a heart ailment.         A forceful, dynamic woman, Mrs. Beyer became a close friend of Secretary Perkins and Eleanor Roosevelt. She is credited by Esther Peterson, a former Presidential adviser on consumer affairs, with bringing diverse state labor laws under a common Federal umbrella.         Mrs. Beyer began her career as secretary of the Minimum Wage Board for the District of Columbia after World War I. Her job was to assess the wages paid to women in the district so minimum levels could be set.         In 1928 she went to work for the Children's Bureau of the Labor Department. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as President, she played a valuable back-room role in the appointment of Secretary Perkins, the first woman ever named to a Cabinet, and in the development of much of the social legislation that marked the New Deal: establishing worker safety, maximum hours, minimum wages and Social Security.         Mrs. Beyer is survived by three sons, Donald of Falls Church, Va., Morton of Lolo, Mont., and Richard of Seattle; 12 grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren.       
        Nancy Sutton, a retired advertising executive, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Sutton, who spent 30 years in advertising, became a vice president in 1962 at Grey Advertising Inc. in Manhattan. Canada Dry, Timex, Revlon and B. F. Goodrich were among her accounts. She retired in 1987.         She received many Clio awards and Andy Awards, the Advertising Club of New York's highest honor. She also received a Cannes International Advertising Festival award.         Ms. Sutton was active in civic affairs, including the Joffrey Ballet, the JOBS program and the Phoenix House drug program.         She graduated from Allegheny College in 1944.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Irene Dunne had a ladylike gentility that made her naughty antics in sophisticated comedies all the more hilarious. In classic farces like ''The Awful Truth,'' in which she portrayed a worldly divorcee briefly inpersonating a gauche chorine, she delighted audiences and reviewers with her wit and elan.         Critics agreed that her artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. Miss Dunne was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and longtime popularity, an Oscar eluded her.         Colleagues regarded her as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., once a co-star, wrote that she was ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         Studied Music         Of Irish descent, Irene Dunne was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec 20. The year was 1904, according to most sources. Her father was a supervisory steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, an accomplished pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended a convent school, studied voice and piano with private teachers, sang in a church choir, attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and, after winning an arduous contest, was given a scholarship at the Chicago Musical College, from which she graduated with high honors.         After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected for being, Miss Dunne recalled, ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in a number of minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, a milestone year, she was cast in the leading role of Magnolia for what became a hugely successful 72-week tour of Florenz Ziegfeld's production of ''Show Boat.''         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after a minor picture called ''Leathernecking'' and six months of drama lessons, she won the leading role of Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Edna Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.''         Miss Dunne was cast for several years in such tragic and lachrymose roles as a hanidcapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a hugely popular tearjerker; a troubled wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she challenged a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 30's         By the mid-30's, her rich, warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline,'' the sparkling ''Roberta,'' ''Show Boat,'' and ''High, Wide and Handsome.''         Miss Dunne chose her vehicles with great care and won even greater popularity in effervescent and urbane madcap comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a daring book and tries to live up to it.In several other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying backtalk.         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her personal favorite of her 41 films.         The actress later received accolades for two major wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy and Van Johnson, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was the indestructible Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's King in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian-American family in early 20th-century San Francisco in ''I Remember Mama.''         Active in Philanthropies         Miss Dunne was miscast in her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by the makeup she wore to play a frumpy elderly Queen Victoria. Her final film was ''It Grows on Trees,'' in 1952. In the 50's, she made occasional television appearances.         As her acting career became less demanding, Miss Dunne found other pursuits, away from the film industry. An active Republican, she was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairman of many philanthropies.         Miss Dunne was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter, Mary Frances.       
        Irene Dunne, the patrician star of madcap comedies, sentimental dramas and Jerome Kern musical films of the 1930's and 40's, died on Tuesday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         Besides enlivening many popular comedies, she proved her versatility in epics like ''Cimarron,'' her second film, which won her stardom; dramas like ''Back Street''; musicals; romances like ''Love Affair,'' and period films, including ''I Remember Mama.''         A regal beauty with a classic face, a trim figure, well-modulated speech and a pleasing soprano voice, she was a dedicated artist. To millions of moviegoers, she was a genteel charmer.         Oscar Eluded Her         Reviewers agreed that Miss Dunne's artistry gave even inferior films some distinction, and she won praise for virtually every performance. She was nominated five times for Academy Awards, but despite her virtuosity and popularity, an Oscar eluded her, as was the case with many stars of her era. But she was among six distinguished Americans awarded the Kennedy Center Honors in the performing arts in 1985.         Colleagues said they regarded Miss Dunne as diligent and cooperative. Douglas Fairbanks Jr., a co-star, hailed her as ''one of the most professional women I've ever known.''         A private person, she separated herself from the movie world when she left the set. She was married for 37 years to Dr. Francis D. Griffin, a dentist and later a businessman; he died in 1965. In 1938, they adopted their daughter from the New York Foundling Hospital.         Studied Music         Miss Dunne, who was of Irish descent, was born in Louisville, Ky., on Dec. 20, 1898. (Some references put the year at 1901.) Her father was a steamship inspector for the Federal Government, and her mother, a pianist, was her first music teacher.         She attended Loretta Academy, a Louisville convent school, and studied voice and piano with private teachers. She attended a music conservatory in Indianapolis and won a contest and scholarship at the Chicago Musical College. After auditioning at the Metropolitan Opera Company in New York, she was rejected, she recalled, for being ''too young, too inexperienced, too slight, too everything.'' Yet she later sang Gilbert and Sullivan operettas with the company one season, when, she remarked, the Met ''sent their youngest and thinnest singers on tour.''         Had Lead in 'Show Boat'         Shifting to musical comedy, the 5-foot 5-inch performer with brown hair and hazel eyes played the title role in a five-month tour of ''Irene'' and had roles in several minor Broadway musicals. In 1929, she won the lead ingenue role of Magnolia for a 72-week national tour of ''Show Boat,'' the now-classic musical by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d musical based on Edna Ferber's novel about Mississippi River show folk.         RKO studios offered Miss Dunne a contract, and after six months of acting lessons, she won a leading role as Richard Dix's wife in the 1931 screen adaptation of Miss Ferber's novel ''Cimarron.'' Her superb portrayal of Sabra Cravat, a sturdy pioneer in the Oklahoma land rush who later becomes a member of Congress - aging half a century - brought her fame.         She was then cast in tragic roles like a handicapped woman in ''Symphony of Six Million''; a banker's self-sacrificing mistress in ''Back Street,'' a harried wife in ''The Silver Cord,'' in which she battled a possessive mother-in-law, and a blinded widow in ''The Magnificent Obsession.''         Kern Cycle in the 1930's         By the mid-1930's, her warm soprano was heard in a Kern cycle - the nostalgic ''Sweet Adeline''; the urbane ''Roberta,'' co-starring Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers; ''Show Boat,'' with Helen Morgan, Allan Jones and Paul Robeson, and ''High, Wide and Handsome,'' an exuberant saga of the Pennsylvania oil rush.         Miss Dunne won her greatest popularity in comedies. In ''Theodora Goes Wild,'' she played a prim New Englander who writes a suggestive book and struggles to live up - or down - to it.         In other farces, including ''The Awful Truth'' and ''My Favorite Wife,'' she and Cary Grant chased each other around with lively wit and dizzying back talk and what Bosley Crowther, then film critic of The New York Times, termed ''pure poetry of motion.''         A Mother and a Queen         She also excelled in romantic dramas like ''Penny Serenade'' and ''Love Affair,'' her favorite of her 41 films, and received accolades for two wartime dramas, ''A Guy Named Joe,'' with Spencer Tracy, and ''The White Cliffs of Dover.'' She was an indomitable Victorian governess to Rex Harrison's monarch in ''Anna and the King of Siam,'' expertly complemented William Powell as Mother in ''Life With Father,'' and was the matriarch of a Norwegian immigrant family in ''I Remember Mama.''         In her last major film, ''The Mudlark,'' in 1950, for which her chiseled features were obliterated by makeup, she played a frumpy, elderly Queen Victoria.

She was named an alternate delegate to the 1957-58 United Nations General Assembly by President Dwight D. Eisenhower. She was a chairwoman of many philanthropies, and she received several honorary doctorates and many other honors.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by two grandchildren.         MAGNOLIA, MAMA AND MRS.

        Marion Rosenwald Ascoli, a philanthropist who was a former chairwoman and president of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, died yesterday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 88 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.         Marion Rosenwald Ascoli, a philanthropist who was a former chairwoman and president of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York, died yesterday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 88 years old and lived in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.         She died of arteriosclerotic heart disease, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Ascoli, a daughter of Julius Rosenwald, a Chicago clothier who was a chairman of Sears, Roebuck & Company, devoted most of her adult life to charitable causes, many of them involving child welfare. She was the widow of Dr. Max Ascoli, the editor and publisher of The Reporter magazine, who died in 1978.         Mrs. Ascoli's principal interest was promoting health services for children. She was active with the Citizens Committee for almost four decades and served as its president from 1960 to 1962 and chairwoman from 1962 to 1964, when she stepped down and became head of the committee's health section, a post she held until 1981.         Married Housing Specialist         At her death Mrs. Ascoli was an honorary vice president of the committee. She was also a former president of the New York Fund for Children and, from 1948 to 1960, was president of the Northside Center for Child Development in Harlem.         Mrs. Ascoli, a native of Chicago, attended Wellesley College for a year before she married Alfred K. Stern, a housing specialist who later became chairman of the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. They were divorced in 1936. She married Dr. Ascoli in 1940.         Mrs. Ascoli, who lived in New York City for more than 50 years, moved to her summer home in Croton-on-Hudson seven years ago. Active in community affairs there, she gave 150 acres of her estate to the Teatown Lake Reservation, a conservation group.         Mrs. Ascoli is survived by two sons, Alfred R. Stern of Manhattan, and Peter M. Ascoli of Chicago; a brother, William Rosenwald of Manhattan; nine grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
        Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the Mayor of Princeton and a member of one of the nation's best-known political families, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 51 years old.         Barbara Boggs Sigmund, the Mayor of Princeton and a member of one of the nation's best-known political families, died of cancer yesterday at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 51 years old.         Mrs. Sigmund first learned that she had cancer in 1982, when a melanoma was found behind her left eye. The eye was removed and she continued with her political career.         But last year, after Mrs. Sigmund unsuccessfully sought the Democratic nomination for governor of New Jersey, doctors found that the cancer had spread. Mrs. Sigmund had finished second in the primary to Representative Jim Florio, who went on to win the general election.         Born in New Orleans         Politics and public service were a way of life for Barbara Boggs Sigmund. She was born on May 27, 1939, in New Orleans about the time that her father, Hale Boggs, was beginning his first term as a Democratic Congressman.         In 1972, the plane carrying her father, then the House majority leader, was lost over Alaska, and her mother, Corinne Lindy Claiborne Boggs, succeeded him in Congress.         Mrs. Sigmund's mother's family, the Claibornes, traced its roots to colonial Jamestown in Virginia and is said to have included more members of Congress than any other American family.         Politics 'All Around Us'         ''Nobody speechified about it,'' Mrs. Sigmund once said about the family's deep interest in politics. ''It was all around us.''         Her brother, Thomas Hale Boggs, is a prominent lawyer in Washington, and her sister, Cokie Roberts of Bethesda, Md., is a correspondent for National Public Radio and for ABC News on television and radio.         Mrs. Sigmund was a graduate of Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y. She married Paul E. Sigmund, a professor of political science at Princeton, in 1964. She became a Latin teacher at the Stuart Country Day School of the Sacred Heart in Princeton. After the birth of the couple's three sons, she returned to the school to teach religion and government.         In 1974, she left Stuart to join the staff of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at the Eagleton Institute at Rutgers University.         After serving as a member of the Princeton Borough Council, she was elected in 1976 to the Mercer County Board of Freeholders. She was president of the board in 1979 and 1980.         In 1982, she decided to run for Congress, hoping she could join her mother on Capitol Hill. But at the last minute she changed her mind and ran instead for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, finishing fourth in a field of 10 candidates. It was during the 1982 campaign that she lost her eye to cancer and surprised everyone by showing up at a fund-raising event hours after checking out of the hospital. She was wearing an eye patch covered with the words ''Vote Sigmund.''         'Subject to the Fates'         After her defeat in the Senate primary, she was elected mayor of Princeton in 1983. ''There's no way to plan a political life,'' she said at the time. ''It's all subject to the fates. I enjoy practicing the craft of government and I think it can be done from the local level up, as well as the other way.''         She brought a ready wit and seemingly boundless energy to the job of Mayor and attacked the problems of providing affordable housing and managing development. She loved to point out that Princeton's image as a wealthy town was misleading. ''It has been a town of mixed-income groups and races for centuries,'' she said.         Once, she complained wryly that most of the town's newer residents were executives in the high-tech industries that were moving to Princeton and surrounding areas. ''We want a certain amount,'' she said, ''but not so much as to destroy the town.''         Writing Poetry         After Mrs. Sigmund was found to have a recurrence of cancer last year, she began chemotherapy treatments but continued to devote as much energy as she could to the duties of her office and her favorite hobby, writing poetry.         Her mother announced in July that she would not run for re-election to Congress. She did not say so at the time, but close associates said she wanted more time to spend with her daughter.         Besides her husband, her mother, her brother and her sister, Mrs. Sigmund is survived by three sons, Paul Jr., of Ann Arbor, Mich., David, of Detroit, and Stephen, of New Orleans.         A funeral service will be held on Saturday at 5:30 P.M. in the Princeton University Chapel.       
        Sonia Yuspeh, an advertising and marketing consultant, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Sonia Yuspeh, an advertising and marketing consultant, died on Sunday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 62 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Yuspeh was president of Sonia Yuspeh Inc., an advertising and marketing firm she started in Manhattan in 1983. Before that, she was a senior vice president and director of research and planning at J. Walter Thompson, which she joined in 1972 as a vice president. She became a senior vice president a year later and was named to the board in 1981.         Before joining J. Walter Thompson, she had been with Grey Advertising, D'Arcy Advertsing and the Marplan division of Interpublic. She was a graduate of Syracuse University and Cornell University and was a past president of the American Marketing Association's New York chapter.         She is survived by her husband, Michel; a son, Leonid, of Rome, Pa.; a daughter, Denise Hidalgo of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
        Helen D. Johnson, the retired president of the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Spring Lake, N.J.         Helen D. Johnson, the retired president of the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Spring Lake, N.J.         She died of complications of cancer, a funeral home representative said.         She was president of the foundation, located in Manhattan for many years but now in Stamford, Conn., from 1968 until illness forced her to retire in May. She was named to the foundation's board in 1965. She was a graduate of St. Mary's Academy in Newburgh, N.Y., and had been an executive secretary for many years before joining the foundation.         She is survived by two nephews.       
        Ruth Wittenberg, who led fights to preserve historic buildings in Greenwich Village, including the Jefferson Market Courthouse, died in her sleep on Monday at her home on West 10th Street, where she had lived for 65 years. She was 91 years old.         Ruth Wittenberg, who led fights to preserve historic buildings in Greenwich Village, including the Jefferson Market Courthouse, died in her sleep on Monday at her home on West 10th Street, where she had lived for 65 years. She was 91 years old.         Mrs. Wittenberg was a familiar figure at City Hall and in other forums where she pleaded the case for preservation and against what she and her neighbors considered invasive development. She was a major force in gaining designation of the Greenwich Village Historic District two decades ago.         ''I'm kind of a landmark myself,'' Mrs. Wittenberg said in 1977 when, at the age of 79, she was honored for her many civic campaigns. She served on what is now Community Board 2 for almost four decades, having been appointed in 1951 to its predecessor, the Community Council for the Greenwich Village area, by the Manhattan Borough President, Robert F. Wagner. For many years she was chairwoman of the board's landmarks committee.         Board Meetings in Hospital         She was active in board affairs until shortly before her death. A small, energetic woman, she broke a hip in 1975 in a fall while walking on the Avenue of the Americas. Board 2's landmark committee meetings were held in her hospital room until she recovered, and in the years after that, she attended Board of Estimate and Planning Commission sessions in a wheelchair.         Born into a politically active family, she said one of her earliest memories was sitting on the knee of Eugene V. Debs, the Socialist leader.         Mrs. Wittenberg was born in Brooklyn and attended Hunter College and Barnard before quitting to help support her family by working as a demographer for the Bell Telephone Company, predicting population trends for expansion of telephone service.         Jailed as a Suffragist         As a suffragist before women won the right to vote, she was twice jailed. She marched in 1965 in Selma, Ala., in a civil rights demonstration with Dr. Martin Luther King Jr..         Not all her battles were victories. She led Village residents in an unsuccessful fight against New York University's plan to construct the 12-story-high Elmer A. Bobst Library on Washington Square South, which residents regarded as too bulky for the site.         Her most conspicuous victory was for demolition of the Women's House of Detention on Greenwich Avenue at Christopher Street and conversion of the site into a community garden, together with preservation of the adjacent Jefferson Market Courthouse, now a branch public library.         Mrs. Wittenberg's husband, Philip, to whom she was married in 1919, died three years ago. She is survived by a daughter, Susanna Berger of New Rochelle, N.Y.; a son, Jonathan, of Tuckahoe, N.Y., five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Jacqueline Schwartzman, a community leader in the Chelsea section of Manhattan for many years, died on Thursday at her home in Chelsea. She was 71 years old.         She had undergone exploratory surgery four weeks ago, but the cause of death is not known, said her husband, Dr. Isidore Schwartzman.         Mrs. Schwartzman, who was born in Chelsea, was an early member of the block association movement in New York City in the 1950's and was the first president of the West 22d Street Association. She was a founder and past president of the Chelsea Independent Democrats.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Leslie Blake and Cheryl Bulbach, both of Manhattan; two sons, Stephen Short of Manhattan and Dr. Wayne Blackmon of Washington, and two grandchildren.       
         Ruth Bishop, past president and a board member of the New York chapter of the United Nations Association, which promotes the United Nations, died on Wednesday at the home of her son Arthur Lipper 3d in White Plains. She was 82 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Bishop, a native New Yorker, was associated with the United Nations Association for 40 years. She was also a board member of the National Conference of Christians and Jews, the World Youth Forum, the New York Council on Alcoholism and the Institute for Mediterranean Affairs.         Besides her son Arthur, Mrs. Bishop, a widow, is survived by another son, A. Michael Lipper of Summit, N.J.; two stepdaughters, Susan Lipper and Randa Bishop, both of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Elisabeth H. Woodburn, one of the country's best-known dealers in rare books on horticulture, died yesterday at her home in Hopewell, N.J. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Woodburn died of a heart attack, family members said.         Mrs. Woodburn once described herself as a "lifelong gardener." She said she derived the name of her book dealership, Booknoll Farm, "from the fact that in 1950 I moved the horses and sheep out of the old barn and converted it to make room for me and my 13,000 books on gardening."         In 1983, her collection included the first herbal produced in this hemisphere, an Aztec document from 1550, and the first herbal written in English, a two-volume set published in 1739.         By 1985, she said her collection was up to 14,000 volumes, even though she had just sold her substantial library of wine books. But she kept a section on grape-growing in her catalogue of horticulture literature.         Mrs. Woodburn was a founding member and a former president of the Antiquarian Booksellers of America, and a founding member of the Council of Botanical and Horticultural Libraries. She was also co-chairwoman of the Library Advisory Committee of the New York Botanical Garden.         She is survived by her husband, Keith C. Robertson; two daughters, Hope E. Robertson of Stockton, N.J., and Christina H. Robertson of Philadelphia; a son, Jeffrey K. Robertson of Hopewell, and her brother, Peter Hexter of Newtown, Pa.       
         Katharine Fisher Schwab, one of the first women to become an officer in the Navy at the outset of World War II, died on Monday at Danbury Hospital in Connecticut. She was 92 years old and lived in Danbury.         She died of respiratory failure, her nephew, J. Christopher Schwab of White Plains, said.         Miss Schwab was a 1919 graduate of Vassar College. She enlisted in the Waves after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and was in the first class of officer candidates at Mount Holyoke College. She was commissioned as a lieutenant and was mustered out of the service in 1945 with the rank of lieutenant commander.         She was a member of the Danbury Zoning Commission and was president of the Danbury chapter of the League of Women Voters.         She is survived by two nephews and four nieces.       
         Vijay Lakshmi Pandit, an Indian independence fighter, diplomat and politician, and the first woman to serve as President of the United Nations General Assembly, died today in the northern town of Dehra Dun. She was 90 years old.         Mrs. Pandit, the sister of India's first Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, was the virtual chief of one of Asia's most important political dynasties, which included Mr. Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, who was Prime Minister for 13 years, and Mrs. Gandhi's son Rajiv, who succeeded his mother in 1984 and served until 1989.         President Ramaswami Venkataraman described Mrs. Pandit today as a "luminous strand in the tapestry of India's freedom struggle." "Distinctive in her elegance, courage and dedication, Mrs. Pandit was an asset to the national movement," he continued.         Frail with age and ailing for some time, Mrs. Pandit had not been poltically active for several years. She moved from New Delhi to Dehra Dun in 1970. But in 1977, outraged by the authoritarian state of emergency imposed from 1975 to 1977 by Indira Gandhi, she campaigned actively against her niece. A popular revolt led to electoral defeat for Mrs. Gandhi, who reportedly never forgave her aunt for her outspoken role.  Ambassador to Moscow         Mrs. Gandhi and Mrs. Pandit were also cool to each other because of what Mrs. Gandhi viewed as her aunt's condescension toward her mother. Kamala Nehru, Mrs. Gandhi's mother, came from a middle-class Kashmiri Brahmin family and married into the rich, aristocratic Nehru family. Accounts of the time say that she never quite adjusted to the change in lifestyle and was often lonely.         Mrs. Pandit, whose husband died in the 1940's, took part in the Indian freedom movement and was arrested several times by the British colonial authorities.         Her brother appointed her as Ambassador to Moscow when India became independent in 1947. She then held a succession of high positions, including ambassadorships to the United States and Britain and, in 1953, presidency of the United Nations General Assembly. She also led the Indian mission to the United Nations.         At home, she was elected a lawmaker two times and served as Governor of the western state of Maharashtra. She retired from public life in 1970 but later served as the Indian representative to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.         She is survived by three daughters, including the novelist Nayantara Sehgal.       
         Hortense W. Gabel, a former New York State Supreme Court justice who was a longtime advocate for housing and civil rights and whose career was shattered when she was accused in the Bess Myerson case, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         She died of heart failure, her daughter, Sukhreet, said.         Mrs. Gabel served on the Civil Court and State Supreme Court for 17 years. In December 1988 she was acquitted of charges that she had abused her powers by improperly reducing the alimony payments of Ms. Myerson's companion, Carl A. Capasso, in exchange for a job for her daughter in the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which Ms. Myerson headed.         Mrs. Gabel had a long and distinguished career in government before assuming the Civil Court bench in 1970. That career began after Mrs. Gabel, already active as a reform Democrat, attended a dinner party in 1948 given by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, the founder of the American Jewish Congress; discussion at the party centered on the formation of a group that would champion the cause of blacks discriminated against in housing.  Enforced Rent Laws         By the mid-1950's, as a director of the Committee on Discrimination in Housing, she was involved in trying to expose abuses in the urban renewal program in New York City and helped draft a report that was highly critical of Robert Moses, the builder who reshaped much of the city.         As head of New York City's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, she dreamed of a slumless New York, and her enforcement of the rent-control laws uncovered overcharges and conspiracies, saving tenants millions of dollars. She also developed rehabilitation programs for sections of Harlem, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.         Later, as a consultant to and vice president of the Center for Community Change, Mrs. Gabel helped develop housing programs in cities and states across the country.         In her several decades of public service, she served as an assistant New York City corporation counsel, general counsel and first deputy administrator of the New York State Temporary Housing Rent Commission and assistant to the mayor for housing and New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Commissioner, a position she held from 1962 to 1965. Mrs. Gabel was also a consultant to the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.         She served as an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1973 and as an acting Family Court judge in 1974. She was appointed to fill a vacancy on the State Supreme Court by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975. She was known as a compassionate judge who supported civil rights and women's causes. In 1986, she was named judge of the year by the National Association of Women Judges, an organization she helped found in 1979.         The organization's president, Justice Christine Durham of the Utah Supreme Court, said in a 1987 interview that Justice Gabel was revered as "one of the grand dames of the New York legal community, who has been a mentor and supporter of women in the profession for decades."         Justice Gabel resigned in 1987 under the cloud of criminal and misconduct investigations that led to the Myerson indictments.         A jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan found Mrs. Gabel, Ms. Myerson and Mr. Capasso not guilty of charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery. The central issue in the case was whether Mrs. Gabel, who was the judge handling preliminary motions in Mr. Capasso's divorce case in 1983, had received a bribe from Ms. Myerson, then New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, in the form of a job for Sukhreet Gabel as a special assistant to Ms. Myerson.         The hiring, the prosecution said, was an inducement to reduce Mr. Capasso's weekly support payments to his wife to $500 from $1,500. Mrs. Gabel had been seeking a job for her daughter. Family Drama         The case was full of bizarre twists and personal dramas. The two-month trial was dominated by the nine days of testimony against her mother by Sukhreet Gabel, the prosecution's star witness, who also taped two telephone conversations with her mother without her knowledge and provided prosecutors with some of her mother's documents.         Mrs. Gabel and her husband, Dr. Milton Gabel, were portrayed during the trial as the protective parents of a troubled woman, and seemed torn between wanting to support her in her moment in the spotlight and hoping that her testimony would not sway the jury.         After the verdict, an exuberant Mrs. Gabel held hands with her daughter outside the courthouse and shouted, "Hooray, we won!"         "This is the best judicial experience I have ever had," she said.         Hortense Wittstein Gabel, known as Horty to her friends, was born Dec. 16, 1912, in the Bronx. She attended public schools in the city and graduated from Hunter College in 1934. Three years later she graduated from Columbia University Law School and worked in her father's law firm. She left in 1944 to marry Dr. Gabel, then an army dentist, and in the war years was a reporter at Fort Hood, Tex., before returning to New York.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Sybil Phillips. They both live in Manhattan. Dr. Gabel died in July.       
         Marjorie Montrose Christiansen, a college administrator, died on Friday at Springmoor Health Center in Raleigh, N.C. She was 65 years old and lived in Chapel Hill, N.C.         She died of cancer of the lung and brain, her husband, Elliot, said.         Mrs. Christiansen served as acting dean of studies at Fordham from 1968 to 1971 after being assistant to the dean of students at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y. She was director of the University of North Carolina's fellows program for eight years before retiring in 1988. She was a past president of the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a sister, Jean Kullander of Savannah, Ga; two daughters, Catherine Hollenberg of Clarks Summit, Pa., and Laura Morse of Wellesley, Mass, and three grandchildren.       
         Carolyn Prentice Falise, a retired securities analyst, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 57 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said a daughter, Katherine Knapp of Stamford, Conn.         Mrs. Falise retired as an assistant vice president at the Bank of New York in 1984 because of ill health. Earlier she had worked as a securities analyst at Kidder Peabody & Company and as a stockbroker at Laird, Bissell & Meeds.         She was a graduate of Smith College and did graduate work in business administration at Baruch College of the City University of New York.         She is survived by another daughter, Christina Sumner Knapp of Manhattan; her stepmother, Janet McNeir Prentice of Belleair, Fla., and a sister, Barbara Kulesh of Pendleton, S.C.         Correction:  December 19, 1990, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Carolyn Prentice Falise, a retired securities analyst, misidentified a surviving daughter. She is Christina SumnerFalise of Manhattan.       
         Janet Chusmir, executive editor of The Miami Herald and a leading proponent of women's advancement to the top levels of management in American journalism, died yesterday at St. Francis Hospital in Miami. She was 60 years old.         The Herald said Ms. Chusmir suffered a brain aneurysm on Friday night, aboutan hour after returning to her home in Miami Beach after the paper's evening news conference at her office.         We have lost a great friend and a great editor," said The Herald's publisher, David Lawrence. "What a zest she had for good newspapers; what energy she had for caring, for worrying about what was right and fair for everyone."         In Ms. Chusmir's three-year tenure as executive editor, The Herald won two Pulitzer Prizes. And in November 1988, less than a year after she was appointed to the paper's top news post, The Herald introduced an enlarged and revamped Spanish-language newspaper, with a separate staff, called El Nuevo Herald. A month ago she was named Editor of the Year by the National Press Foundation, which cited her for "transforming The Herald to serve the unique multicultural population of greater Miami."         When Ms. Chusmir was named The Herald's executive editor in December 1987, about 85 percent of the newsroom executives in the country were men, according to a survey by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Of the society's 1,000 members -- the top editors of the nation's dailies -- about 80 were women. Opposed Special Position         The dearth of women in high positions was the subject of a seminar at the society's convention in 1988. And when an editor suggested that it was desirable for newspapers to create a "woman's seat" among their top editors, Ms. Chusmir denounced the idea. "The seat becomes devalued," she said, "and the function becomes devalued."         Ms. Chusmir was a feminist who understood the potency of understatement. She recently told a group of Hispanic women: "Pick your battles. It's not good to be fighting over each little thing and male chauvinistic action. Instead, fight for the important things: equal pay and equal respect. Fight smart."         At the same time, she was fond of telling female executives not to forsake their ability to nurture. "I always remind myself that I can't hug a newspaper," she said.         Janet Zoll was born in Boston and earned a journalism degree from Boston University in 1949. A week after graduation she married the editor of her college newspaper, Leonard Chusmir, and soon became a mother and homemaker.         It was not until after moving to Miami Beach with her two school-age children in 1963 that Ms. Chusmir took a job at the Miami Beach Daily Sun, which no longer operates, writing articles at a flat rate of $2.50 each. She was soon given a full-time position. Five Years in Colorado         In 1968, The Herald hired her as a general assignment reporter, and, soon afterward, she was writing a column and receiving awards for her feature writing. In the early 1970's, Ms. Chusmir was named editor of The Herald section News For and About Women, which in her tenure was renamed Living Today. By 1977, she had been promoted to assistant managing editor for features.         Then, in 1982, Knight-Ridder Newspapers, the Herald's corporate parent, appointed her president and publisher of The Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo., making her the first female chief executive of one of the organization's newspapers. Five years later, she returned to The Herald as executive editor.         Last year, in an occasional column she wrote, "View From the Newsroom," Ms. Chusmir offered readers a personal glance at herself. She said her favorite avocations were "baking, reading, swimming, dieting." Her favorite place was "my balcony at sunset." And of journalism, she said, "It's a sacred trust."         Besides her husband, Ms. Chusmir is survived by a son, Steven, of Fort Lauderdale; a daughter, Marsha Chusmir-Shapiro of Daytona Beach, and a grandson.       
         Helen Sachs Straus, a trustee of Teachers College of Columbia University for 44 years and an executive at her family's radio station, died in her sleep yesterday at her home in New Canaan, Conn. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Straus, born in Elberon, N.J., was the daughter of Bernard Sachs, the neurologist who was a co-discoverer of Tay-Sachs disease. She studied at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and the Ecole des Arts in Montreux, Switzerland.         In 1915 she married Nathan Straus Jr. In 1943 Mr. Straus bought WMCA radio and became its president. Mrs. Straus became vice president of the station in 1948. She also served as director of public affairs and education and children's programming.         From 1939 to 1942 Mrs. Straus was a member of the New York City Board of Higher Education. She was active throughout her life promoting education and child welfare through many organizations, including the New York Section of the Council of Jewish Women, the National Maternal Child Health Council and the National Scholarship Service Fund for Negro Students. She was on the board of Teachers College from 1938 to 1982.         She was a member of the Cosmopolitan Club in New York City and a former president of the New York City Women's Club. Until taking up residence in New Canaan 10 years ago, she lived in New York City and on her family's estate, Quarry Lake, in White Plains.         Mrs. Straus is survived by her four sons, Nathan 3d, of Pound Ridge, N.Y.; Barnard, and Irving Lehman, of New York City, and R. Peter, of Washington, D.C.; 11 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Toni Greenberg, a philanthropist and arts administrator, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Greenberg was president of New York Pro Musica and was the widow of Noah Greenberg, founder and musical director of the early-music ensemble, who died in 1966. She served as assistant to the president of the Mannes College of Music from 1966 to 1970 and was acting director of the New York University Institute for the Humanities in the late 1970's.         She was born in Danzig, then a free city on the Baltic and now Gdansk, Poland, and received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's degree in library science from Columbia.         Long interested in the study of Judaism, she made gifts for that purpose to several institutions, including Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which she was a governor; the New York Public Library, Yale and Skidmore College, where she was a trustee.         She is survived by two daughters, Anne Donovan of London and Jane Ernst of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and four grandsons.
