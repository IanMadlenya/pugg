         Hsieh Ping-ying, a Chinese feminist author known for her autobiographical work, died on Jan. 5 in San Francisco. She was 93.         Miss Hsieh moved to San Francisco in the mid-1970's from Taiwan, to which she had fled from mainland China in 1949.         Miss Hsieh ''pioneered the literary construction of a soldier image for women -- as imaginative as it may have been -- and thereby influenced this kind of literature in China for decades,'' said Charles A. Laughlin,  professor of modern Chinese literature at Yale University.         Her first book was ''War Diary,''  published in 1928 in Shanghai. Dr. Laughlin recalled that, in writing the book, Miss Hsieh accompanied soldiers of the Chinese Nationalist army in 1926 and 1927, when it was trying to bring warlords in the eastern half of China under control and while she was a ''girl soldier'' with propaganda training.         ''At a time when Chinese women were trying to find new modes of identity in the 20th century after having shed the shackles of traditional Chinese feminine identity, there were many different, alternative identities available to them,'' Dr. Laughlin said, ''and I think she was the first to create this very military one.''         A scholar's daughter, Miss Hsieh was born in a village in Hunan province. Before she was 20, she enrolled in the Wuchang Central Political and Military School. The academy trained young women to be uniformed propagandists attached to the regular military.         After her relatively brief military service Miss Hsieh returned to her village and an arranged marriage. In 1940 her book ''Girl Rebel: The Autobiography of Hsieh Pingying'' was published in the United States.         After her marriage ended, Ms. Hsieh was charged with being a Communist and radical and was imprisoned. After her release she studied Chinese literature and worked as a roving writer, editor and teacher. In 1937, when Japan invaded China, she again became a ''girl soldier,'' accompanying Chinese combat troops to the front. Diary entries about her experiences appeared in newspapers and in another book. After World War II she escaped to Taiwan, where she taught and wrote.         Her second husband, Earl Chia,  died in 1988. The couple became American citizens after moving to San Francisco. She is survived by a daughter, Lily Chia Brissman of Nacogdoches, Tex.; two sons, Luke, of Palos Verdes, Calif., and Wen, of Ambler, Pa., and four grandchildren.       
         Vivian Fine, a composer who wrote ballet scores for Martha Graham and Jose Limon, as well as copious amounts of orchestral, chamber and vocal music, died on Monday at the Southern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington after an automobile accident. She was 86 and lived in Hoosick Falls, N.Y.         Ms. Fine composed in a style that evolved gracefully over the years. Her early works, with their expressive dissonance, inventive counterpoint and sharp rhythmic edges, reflect both the influence of her teacher, Roger Sessions, and the practical demands of writing for modern dance groups. Later she developed a language in which technical demands and a slightly acerbic sensibility were balanced by wit and lyricism. By the late 1980's her shorter works were being included regularly in recital and chamber programs.         Ms. Fine was born in Chicago on Sept. 28, 1913, and began her musical life as a piano prodigy. She won a scholarship to the Chicago Musical College when she was 5. She later studied with Djane Lavoie-Herz, a student of Scriabin. Her early composition teachers included Ruth Crawford Seeger and Adolf Weidig. She moved to New York in 1931, where she continued her piano studies with Abby Whiteside and studied composition with Sessions.         In the mid-1930's Ms. Fine worked as a rehearsal pianist for several New York dance companies, and within a few years she was composing for them as well. Among her early ballet scores are ''The Race of Life'' (1937) for Doris Humphrey, ''Opus 51'' (1938) for Charles Weidman and ''Tragic Exodus'' and ''They Too Are Exiles'' (both 1939) for Hanya Holm. She later wrote ''Alcestis'' (1960) for Graham and ''My Son, My Enemy'' (1965) for Limon.         Ms. Fine's symphonic works include ''Elegiac Song'' for muted strings (1937) and ''Meeting for Equal Rights 1866,'' for soprano, baritone, narrator and chorus (1976).         As an active campaigner for American music, she helped found the American Composers Alliance in 1938 and was its vice president from 1961 to 1965. She was also concerned with feminist issues. One of her operas, ''The Women in the Garden'' (1978), includes among its scenes a colloquy between Virginia Woolf, Isadora Duncan, Gertrude Stein and Emily Dickinson, using quotations from their writings. Her last major work, ''The Memoirs of Uliana Rooney'' (1994), was a multimedia opera with a libretto by Sonya Friedman that followed a female composer through the decades of the 20th century. The work is partly autobiographical but alludes as well to Alma Mahler and Ruth Crawford Seeger.         Still, Ms. Fine was uneasy with the idea of defining composers by their sex. ''I hope the term 'woman composer' will be dropped soon,'' she told an interviewer from The New York Times in 1989. ''I think we are in a better place than we were 20 years ago. Women are accepted in literature, painting and sculpture. We don't talk of 'poetesses' anymore. And woman performers as soloists -- singers, pianists, violinists -- have been accepted for a long time.''         Ms. Fine taught composition at the Juilliard School, New York University, the State University of New York at Potsdam and Bennington College in Vermont.         She is survived by a sister, Adelaide Fine of Shaftsbury, Vt., and two daughters, Peggy Karp of Berkeley, Calif., and Nina Karp of North Bennington, Vt.         Correction:  March 28, 2000, Tuesday  An obituary of the composer Vivian Fine on Friday omitted a survivor. He is her husband, Benjamin Karp of Hoosick Falls, N.Y.       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Ingrid G. Brainard, a dance historian and teacher of historical dance, died on Feb. 18 at her home in West Newton, Mass. She was 74.         The cause was a heart attack, said Tristram Perry, a spokesman for the Boston Conservatory, where Dr. Brainard taught.         Dr. Brainard received a doctorate in musicology from the University of Gottingen in Germany, writing her dissertation on ''The Choreographer of the Court Dances of Burgundy, France and Italy in the 15th Century.'' Her area of expertise extended through dance of the 18th century.         In addition to reconstructing and staging the dances, Dr. Brainard lectured and wrote for publications including the New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, the Dance Research Journal, the Harvard Dictionary of Music and Die Musikforschung.         One of the first fellows of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Studies in Cambridge, Mass., Dr. Brainard was an artist in residence at Northeastern University and served as a director and chairwoman of the Congress on Research in Dance. She also founded the Cambridge Court Dancers. She had taught dance history at the Boston Conservatory since 1983.         Her marriage to Paul Brainard ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Christopher, of Newton.       
         Frances Gray Patton, a writer whose short stories appeared in The New Yorker through four decades and whose works included the popular 1954 novel ''Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' died Tuesday at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. She was 94 and lived in Durham.         Ms. Potter's finely crafted stories offered glimpses into Durham society in the mid-20th century, a world she knew well as a Duke faculty wife.         Her first published work, ''A Piece of Bread,'' the story of a Southern girl's encounter with a prison chain gang, won a Kenyon Review prize and was included among the 1945 ''O. Henry Memorial Award Prize Stories.''         After that, The New Yorker began publishing Ms. Patton's stories, 30 in the next 10 years. Others appeared in magazines like Colliers, Harper's, The Saturday Review of Literature and McCall's. Her first book, ''The Finer Things of Life'' (1951), a collection culled mostly from works that appeared in The New Yorker, earned praise from critics.         Three years later, Ms. Patton's first novel, ''Good Morning, Miss Dove,'' was published. Developed from her story ''The Terrible Miss Dove,'' first published in Ladies' Home Journal, the work chronicled the life of a strict but beloved geography teacher in a small American town whose sudden illness shocks the community.         Writing in The New York Times, Charles Poore described the work as ''ruthlessly sentimental'' and ''a cheerful mixture of 'Goodbye Mr. Chips' and 'Mary Poppins,' with touches of the rigorous way to salvation from 'Life With Father.' ''         The novel was a Book-of-the-Month Club selection, and the movie rights were sold to 20th Century Fox, which turned the story into a popular film starring Jennifer Jones.         In 1955, Ms. Patton published ''A Piece of Luck,'' a second collection of stories, set mostly in suburbia, that explored the private worlds of children and women. A third collection, ''28 Stories,'' was published in 1969.         Frances MacRae Gray was born in Raleigh, N.C., where her father was editor of The Raleigh Times. Her mother had been the first woman to enroll at the University of North Carolina.         Ms. Patton became a writer by way of the theater. After high school, she attended Trinity College, now Duke University, before enrolling at the University of North Carolina, where she held a fellowship as a playwright and was active in the Carolina Playmakers. Over the years, she taught creative writing at both universities.         She is survived by a son, Robert, of San Francisco; two daughters, Mary Bogdonoff of Manhattan and Susannah Patton of Bethesda, Md.; nine grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Rose Wyler, who wrote more than 50 books for children on science and other topics, died on June 12 at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Ms. Wyler was the sole author of over two dozen books and a co-author of others. One of her best-known works is ''Spooky Tricks'' (1968), which she wrote with her husband Gerald Ames. When it was reissued in 1994, Scripps Howard News Service called it ''the perfect Halloween book'' for ''school-agers who are just beginning to read.''         Ms. Wyler once recalled that as a girl she ''always had a collection of stones, bugs or leaves and always wanted to know more about nature.'' She never could find books on nature as a child, she said, so at 11 she decided she was going to write them.         Her book ''Science Fun With Toy Boats and Planes'' (1986) was praised by The Christian Science Monitor, which said: ''For the young physicist, there is a wealth of information in this little book.''         A native of the Bronx, Ms. Wyler  received a B.A. from Barnard and a master's from Teacher's College at Columbia. Her first marriage ended in divorce. She married Mr. Ames in 1948. He died in 1993.         She is survived by two sons, Joseph Kosok of Vera Cruz, Mexico, and Karl Kosok of Silver Spring, Md.; a stepdaughter, Eva-Lee Baird of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Dooley, who watched more than 4,000 consecutive Boston Red Sox home games over 55 seasons from her front-row box seat, died Monday in Boston, hours before her beloved Red Sox suffered a 22-1 beating from the Yankees. She was 87, a year younger than Fenway Park, the home of the Red Sox.         In 1996, Ted Williams, the greatest Red Sox player of them all, said of Ms. Dooley: ''Forever, she's the greatest Red Sox fan there'll ever be. Every time I get a chance to get around here I like to do it, because she's really a big league gal.''         Ms. Dooley shrugged off that accolade.         ''I do not consider myself a fan,'' she said. ''I am a friend of the Red Sox.''         Lib Dooley was a faithful friend. She called Williams Theodore and telephoned him on his every birthday. When Bobby Doerr retired, she started sending him clippings from Boston newspapers.         Dom DiMaggio was another of her Red Sox favorites. Upon learning of her death, he told The Boston Globe: ''She was a perfect lady. I remember so well when she presented us with our American League championship rings after we won in 1946. She was so thrilled. The Red Sox were practically her whole life, from what I could gather.''         They were indeed. From 1944 until 1998, she did not miss a home game and sometimes made road trips. Illness forced her to miss some games in 1998 and 1999. This year, she made only opening day and last month's Red Sox Hall of Fame dinner.         She would sit in Box 36-A in the front row behind the Red Sox on-deck circle, delivering Oreos and Starbursts to the players and then watching the game intently. Despite her close seat, she said only one foul ball came her way, by Carroll Hardy in the early 1960's. She caught it and broke two fingers.         She never married. She attended Boston College at night, and then, for 39 years, was a gym and health teacher in the Boston public school system. In 1956, she moved to an apartment in Kenmore Square. It was seven minutes from Fenway Park, she said, a little longer as age made walking more difficult.         She came by baseball naturally. In 1901, her father, John Stephen Dooley, helped the new Red Sox team get a home at the Huntington Avenue Grounds. According to her family, the father attended every season opener from 1894 until 1970, when he died at 97. ''I despise bridge and I hate gossip,'' Lib Dooley said. ''I wanted something where I could go by myself without anyone ruining it by saying, 'I can't do it this week.' Baseball gets you out in the fresh air and keeps you from talking about your neighbors.''         Her friendship with players did not alter her perspective.         ''The fans are really baseball, not the players,'' she said. ''You can always get someone to play ball. It doesn't have to be someone who gets $4 million to work two hours a day.''         David Leary, her 24-year-old grandnephew, sat in her seat at Monday night's game. Afterward, he got a game ball to place in her coffin.         Her survivors include four sisters, Winifred A. Dooley, Katherine M. Dooley and Anna Martin, all of Milton, Mass., and Mary Jane Boyd of Texas.       
         Ann Roe Robbins, a teacher of cooking who, along with James A. Beard and other food writers, helped to convince Americans of the 1960's that cooking could be an art form, died June 25 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         In 1960, Craig Claiborne, the New York Times food critic, heaped praise on Mrs. Robbins's private cooking school and the one run by Mr. Beard as the most important such schools in the city.         Mrs. Robbins's popular classes were held in the large kitchen of her apartment overlooking Central Park West. She specialized in international cuisine.         Mrs. Robbins also wrote about a dozen cookbooks, including ''25 Vegetables Anyone Can Grow'' (Crowell, 1942) and ''How to Cook Well'' (Crowell, 1946), and she collaborated on ''The Dione Lucas Meat and Poultry Cook Book'' (Little Brown, 1955). An anonymous reviewer for The New York Times said of the meat and poultry book: ''This probably is the cookbook of the year.''         Mrs. Robbins was born on Sept. 14, 1905, in Newark. She graduated from Smith College in 1926, and when she married a few years later, she told an interviewer, she could ''hardly make a meat loaf.''         But she learned. When asked for advice on how to learn to cook, she said: ''By going into the kitchen and pitching in. Get a good basic cookbook and let it be your guide. I learned by experience. I still think it the best teacher.''         She is survived by three daughters, Jennifer Manocherian of Scarsdale, N.Y., Susan Morrison of Hingham., Mass., and Victoria Cowal of Mexico City; 11 grandchildren; and 14 great-grandchildren.       
         Brenda Reilly, a teacher, sports administrator and three-sport coach in a career of almost three decades at Central Connecticut State University in New Britain, died of cancer at a hospice in Branford, Conn., on Aug. 5. She was 62.         Reilly first gained a degree of prominence as a member of the Raybestos Brakettes fast-pitch softball team in the 1950's and 60's. The team won scores of national and world championships, and its members encouraged Reilly to attend college, pointing her on a career that made her a well-known coach and athletic administrator.         ''Brenda joined the Brakettes at 18 right out of high school and worked at the Raybestos factory in Stratford for a number of years while playing for the team from 1956 until 1965,'' said Mickey Macchietto Stratton, one of her teammates. ''Most of us were either college graduates, in college or about to go to college, and we encouraged her to do the same.''         Reilly, an infielder and pitcher on the Brakettes, finally heeded her teammates' advice at the age of 26 and enrolled at California State University, Los Angeles, said Kathy Pullek, assistant director of sports information at Central Connecticut State. ''By the time Brenda was a senior member of the women's basketball team, she was 30 and three years older than the coach,'' Pullek said.         In 1970, Reilly received a master's degree in physical education at U.C.L.A. The next year, she came to Central Connecticut as a physical education teacher and a basketball, softball and volleyball coach. She held those positions for 24 years.         In 1981, she received a doctorate in physical education from Springfield College. From 1996 until her death, she was Central Connecticut State's associate athletic director and senior women's administrator.         While she was the women's basketball coach, Central Connecticut reached the quarterfinals of the Division II National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament in 1986 after posting a 24-4 record, and Reilly was honored as coach of the year.         Reilly was a longtime high school and college basketball official, and she served on a number of N.C.A.A. committees that examined issues related to the Title IX gender-equity laws.         Reilly, who was born in New York City, is survived by three brothers and 17 nieces and nephews.       
         Ethel Brown Fitzgerald, a former New York City teacher and school administrator, lawyer and musician, died July 19 at a hospital in upstate Amsterdam. She was 68 and lived in Fonda, N.Y., and Brooklyn.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Fitzgerald spent 16 often contentious years on the City Board of Education's semiautonomous Board of Examiners, from 1974 until the State Legislature restructured it out of existence in 1990. She served variously as a member, vice chairwoman and chairwoman.         The examiners tested prospective teachers and supervisors and drew up lists from which the school board appointed job candidates. Their critics charged the panel had become a cumbersome anachronism and a bottleneck.         In Mrs. Fitzgerald's view the chancellor and school board were trying to circumvent the merit system. Indeed, she asserted, they flirted with the very Tammany Hall-style patronage system that led to the creation of the independent examiners in the first place, in 1898.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Fitzgerald was a 1954 music graduate of Hunter College and taught orchestral and choral music in the public schools until 1967. As Ethel Brown, a member of the musicians' union, she played the cello with professional symphony orchestras.         By 1968 she had completed her graduate work at Brooklyn College, Columbia University and New York University. She received the certificate of an education supervisor and administrator from Hunter, and, in 1981, she received a doctor of laws degree from Brooklyn Law School.         She held a number of positions as assistant principal, principal and teachers' trainer before being appointed to the Board of Examiners, then practically a lifetime job. In recent years she had been in private law practice in Fonda.         Mrs. Fitzgerald is survived by a son, Dr. Kim Fitzgerald of Cleveland; her mother, Effie Hargett Brown of Fonda; and six grandchildren.       
         Dawn Langley Simmons, an author whose tumultuous life included a sex change operation and an interracial marriage that scandalized her adopted hometown, Charleston, S.C., died on Sept. 18 at her daughter's home there. She was 77.         Mrs. Simmons, who was the adopted child of the English actress Margaret Rutherford, had Parkinson's disease, said her daughter, Natasha.         Mrs. Simmons was the author of more than 20 books, including novels, biographies, and books for her children. Several of her books understandably touched on her life experiences, given a journey that started on an English estate, touched down on an Indian reservation and stirred deep turmoil in civil-rights-era Charleston.         Jack Hitt, a journalist who grew up in Charleston across the street from Mrs. Simmons and wrote about her for GQ magazine, remembered her as a figure with a piercing stare, a pillbox hat and ''a Dippity-Do hairstyle -- a dowdy doppelganger of Jackie Kennedy.''         Mrs. Simmons was a person around whom legends swirled, Mr. Hitt said. She lived in a grand house filled with antiques and with a hidden garden. She was said to have had a coming-out party for two of her dogs, who were displayed on velvet cushions in the living room, dressed in chenille, long gloves and pearls.         Mrs. Simmons was named Gordon Langley Hall when she was born, at Sissinghurst, the estate of the writer Vita Sackville-West, in Heathfield, Sussex, England. Gordon was the illegitimate child of Jack Copper, Sackville-West's chauffeur (a grandfather was Rudyard Kipling's gardener) and Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, who came, Mrs. Simmons always said, from a high social class.         Mrs. Simmons said she was born with an adrenal abnormality that causes the female genitalia to resemble a man's and was thus raised as a boy. She always maintained that she was -- unequivocally -- female.         As a boy, young Gordon played with Sackville-West's son, Nigel Nicolson. Mr. Nicolson remembered Gordon in a telephone conversation from England last Friday. ''We called him 'Dinky,' and I always think of him that way,'' he said, adding that young Gordon always looked like a boy.         At Sissinghurst, the young Gordon met Virginia Woolf, Ms. Sackville-West's lover and the author of ''Orlando,'' a novel about a boy who changes into a beautiful woman. ''Had she lived a little longer, Vita would have been intrigued to know that the child 'Dinky,' as she called me, would become a real-life Orlando,'' Mrs. Simmons wrote in her memoir, ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend,''(1995, Wyrick & Company).         In his late teens, Mr. Hall emigrated to Ontario, where he worked as a missionary, teacher and midwife among the Ojibwa Indians, according to his book about his experiences, ''Me Papoose Sitter'' (Crowell, 1955). He became an editor for The Winnipeg Free Press, and from 1953 to 1956 was society editor of The Nevada Daily Mail in Missouri. Mr. Nicolson said he was ''a very good journalist.''         He also wrote books about Princess Margaret, Jacqueline Kennedy and American Evangelism. According to the reference work ''Contemporary Authors,'' a critic named W. H. Archer praised Mr. Hall's ''Rose for Mrs. Lincoln: A Biography of Mary Todd Lincoln'' (Beacon Press, 1970), calling it ''scrupulously researched'' and written in ''a charmingly premeditated style.''         In New York in his 20's, Mr. Hall met Margaret Rutherford, who became enchanted with him and, with her husband, Stringer Davis, adopted him.         In that period Mr. Hall also befriended the painter Isabel Whitney, who left him $2 million at her death in 1962, he said. Around that time, he moved to Charleston, settling into a faded 1840 house on Society Street in the Ansonborough section, which had a large gay population. He became friendly with Charleston's grandes dames, restored his house and filled it with Chippendale furniture, mirrors said to belong to George Washington, and bed steps said to have been owned by Robert E. Lee.         In 1968 he underwent a sex change operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and became Dawn Pepita Langley Hall.         The following year Dawn Hall married her 22-year-old black butler, John-Paul Simmons. The publisher of ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' was quoted as calling it the first documented interracial marriage in Charleston's history. A bomb threat forced the couple to move the wedding from a Baptist church to the bride's home, and the gifts were destroyed by a firebomb.         In England, Miss Rutherford was reported to have said, ''I am delighted that Gordon has become a woman, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of another race, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of a lower station, but I understand the man is a Baptist!''         Soon, Mrs. Simmons appeared to be pregnant. Then in 1972, she began strolling with a baby carriage bearing a little girl whom she called Natasha.         That was the final straw for many people in Charleston. Mrs. Simmons claimed that a white man broke into her house wearing a ski mask and beat her, breaking her nose and foot and necessitating hospitalization.         She also said that her husband beat her. In 1974, after a period of turbulence in which she accused her husband of selling her belongings to buy whisky, the family moved to Catskill, N.Y. Some time later, Mr. Simmons was confined to a mental institution near Albany. His daughter says he is now an outpatient.         Mrs. Simmons spent most of her later years in Hudson, N.Y., where she was an active member of a local Episcopal church and a leader of its youth group. She continued to support her husband and daughter on her meager earnings as a writer.         Her daughter said she would prefer not to discuss her mother's past. ''I would like her to be remembered as the grandmother that she was, as a family woman,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''She was devoted to my children.''         In addition to her husband and daughter, Mrs. Simmons is survived by three grandchildren.         After she published ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' in 1995, her childhood friend, Mr. Nicolson, reminisced about her in The Spectator. ''I have maligned her in the past, mocked her strange fate and refused to meet her,'' he wrote.         ''She had asked me for help in arranging an English marriage,'' he wrote, ''and when she called on me, I hid.'' On a trip to Charleston, he avoided meeting her, but saw her on television. ''I saw on the wall behind her photographs of my mother,'' he continued. ''For the first time I was touched.''         But ''there is not a word of reproach for me in her book,'' Mr. Nicolson marveled. ''Like everything else about Dinky, it is gallant, resilient and unfailingly generous.''       
         Penelope Russianoff, a psychotherapist, writer and lecturer who advised women on how to assert themselves, died on Aug. 28 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 82 and also had a home and practice in Sherman, Conn.         Dr. Russianoff maintained that women must unlearn the helplessness they learned at an early age. Helplessness, she held, can lead to serious problems like depression, overeating, battering, alcoholism, drugs and sexual dysfunction.         Marriage and male companionship are fine, she asserted, but a woman must be able to do without them. It is good for a woman to have a man's attention, she said, but self-esteem must not depend on it. She tried to show her clients how to communicate with themselves and others.         Her practice always included some celebrity clientele. It grew after the director Claudia Weill suggested to Paul Mazursky that he cast her as a therapist in his 1978 film ''An Unmarried Woman.''         Its main character, played by Jill Clayburgh, falls apart when her husband suddenly deserts her for a new life. Dr. Russianoff acted the oh-so-sincere therapist who makes her feel better about herself, using truisms that can comfort the deeply distressed.         Her appearance in the movie, filmed in her Manhattan penthouse office, drew much criticism from colleagues. It also increased her practice and earned her a book contract.         ''Why Do I Think I Am Nothing Without a Man?'' became a national best seller in 1982. A second book, ''When Am I Going to Be Happy?'' (1989) was reissued by Bantam in 1997 and remains in print.         Dr. Russianoff, whose maiden name was Pearl, was born in Baltimore. She graduated from the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor in 1939 with honors in psychology and philosophy, and received a master's degree in clinical psychology in 1941. She received a doctorate in that discipline at Northwestern University in 1951.         She was a member of the faculty of the New School for Social Research from 1960 until the late 1990's.         Her husband, Leon Russianoff, a noted clarinetist and teacher, died in 1990. She is survived by a daughter, Sylvia Linguiti of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.         Dr. Russianoff ran workshops on performers' phobias and treated many sufferers of stage fright. After her debut on camera, she was much in demand on talk shows and as a speaker at forums on women's problems.         Of the movie, she said, ''It was great fun, especially because I could change the lines.''         The lines in the original script by Mr. Mazursky, she said, ''were not things therapists would say.''       
         Jeanne Lee, one of the great jazz singers in the avant-garde tradition and a teacher of singing, composition and movement, died on Wednesday in Tijuana, Mexico. She was 61.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Naima Hazelton.         Because Ms. Lee performed in two radically different styles, her singing was difficult to categorize. One of her voices was dry, slow and breathy,  influenced by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.         In 1961 she and a classmate from Bard College, the pianist Ran Blake, performed as a duo at the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night contest. They won, and the album they later recorded, ''The Newest Sound Around'' (later reissued on CD as ''The Legendary Duets''), has remained a cult favorite.         In jazz standards and Thelonious Monk tunes on the album, Ms. Lee and Mr. Blake subtracted swing, but added intellectual coolness, abstruse piano harmonies and vocal influences from Holiday and Washington; the record is a series of minimalist dreams. (In 1989 she and Mr. Blake  recorded a duet album in the same style, ''You Stepped Out of a Cloud.'')         In her other vocal style, Ms. Lee approached words as sounds; this voice was harsh and booming, and she used her teeth, lips and tongue to wring drama out of each syllable, presaging singers like Diamanda Galas. In the mid-1960's she was a multidisciplinary artist, writing music with members of the Fluxus school like Alison Knowles and Dick Higgins, and gradually becoming more aligned with the rest of the late-1960's avant-garde in jazz.         When she met and fell in love with the vibraphonist and composer Gunter Hampel in 1967, she began 20 years of collaborations with him in different jazz-related forms.         While at Bard, Ms. Lee had studied child psychology and in 1970 was awarded a Martin Luther King Fellowship for Urban Studies by New York University to develop a curriculum for elementary school students that combined music and dance with academic subjects.         She shuttled between New York and Europe until the late 1980's, living and working with Mr. Hampel, performing in duets, small groups and big bands, as well as conducting clinics and workshops; the couple made some 25 albums together, many of them for Mr. Hampel's own label, Birth.         Ms. Lee also recorded with Marion Brown, Andrew Cyrille, Carla Bley, Peter Kowald and Reggie Workman, among others. She was active as a composer, combining vocal jazz with music and dance, working often with the choreographer Mickey Davidson.         She lived in New York from 1994 to 1996 and for the last five years  taught music and movement at conservatories in Antwerp, Belgium,  and in The Hague.         In addition to Ms. Hazelton of Los Angeles, she is survived by another daughter, Cavana Lee-Hampel of Berlin; a son, Ruomi Lee-Hampel of New York; and a grandson.       
         Andy Logan, the reporter whose witty, elegant and gently sarcastic voice dissected the goings-on at New York's City Hall for The New Yorker magazine for 25 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old and had been ill with pancreatic cancer.         For two decades, Ms. Logan was the dean of the City Hall press corps, a diminutive figure in black with an encyclopedic knowledge of the city's social and political history. She was a mentor to dozens of younger reporters and most days carried cookies to the press room, known as Room 9, for the harried reporters she referred to as kids. She covered five mayors, from John V. Lindsay to Rudolph W. Giuliani, and was fond of using their own words to expose hypocrisies and explode myths.         ''The world I cover is so full of vaudeville,'' she told a reporter in 1992. ''The worst thing you can do to politicians is to quote them verbatim. Such naked foolishness.''         Ms. Logan was born in Cleveland on Feb. 6, 1920, and grew up in Ohio and North Carolina. She attended Swarthmore College, where she wrote fiction and started a life of letters. She won an O. Henry Award in 1941 for her first published short story, ''The Visit.''         It was at college that Ms. Logan changed her name from Isabel Ann to Andy. She detested the nickname Izzy and chose Andy in honor of the New Yorker essayist E.B. White, who was also known as Andy.         The New Yorker hired her as soon as she graduated, in 1942, and she became one of the first women to write for ''The Talk of the Town.''  During a half century with the magazine, she wrote more than 260 articles, along with three short stories and four poems. Her subjects ranged from the Nuremberg trials, to 19th century New York scandals, to the yearly review of toys at Christmastime.         In 1943, she married Charles S. Lyon, who was a deputy chief prosecutor at the Nuremberg trials and later became a United States assistant attorney general. They had seven children. He died in 1989 at the age of 72. She is survived by two sons:  Brooks, of Canandaigua, N.Y., and Jonathan, of New York City; a daughter, Emily Lyon, of Cambridge, Mass.; and one granddaughter, Corinna Lyon.         ''There was nothing to be compared with coming home after school and sitting down with my parents,'' Ms. Logan's daughter said. ''They would talk about everything, and make it so clear.''         Ms. Logan was also the author of two historical books: In ''Against the Evidence'' (McCall, 1970), she chronicled the 1912 trial of a police lieutenant, Charles Becker, who was convicted, wrongly she maintained, of shooting a smalltime gambler. She also published ''The Man Who Robbed the Robber Barons'' (W.W. Norton & Company, 1965), an account of the career of Col. William d'Alton Mann.         But it was at City Hall that she would become a local literary legend. Her first About City Hall column appeared in 1969, though her expert knowledge of city politics stretched back to the La Guardia administration.         ''I can scare the hell out of the kids by telling them that the mayor when I first came down here was La Guardia,'' she said in 1992. ''They help me in and out of the room for at least an hour after that.''         In her City Hall reporting, she earned a reputation for saving every scrap of news about the political figures she covered and forgetting nothing they had said. Her columns often pointed out the comic side of politics, exposing where noble words hide selfish designs.         ''She wrote about the city and City Hall as if it were a passing parade, with a great sense of irony and wit,'' said David Remnick, the editor of the New Yorker. ''To me, she was like Murray Kempton, an essential voice and treasure of New York.''         Her columns often did not endear her to mayors. Mayor Edward I. Koch once said he detested her and ''disinvited'' her to the annual Christmas party for reporters at Gracie Mansion, an insult she wore like a badge of honor.         ''She believed in flaying, and most people don't like to be skinned,'' Mr. Koch said yesterday. But in the same breath, he praised her reporting. ''She was a repository of City Hall history,'' he said. ''She had covered so many mayors and kept minute records of everything they said.''         Her unpopularity with some politicians may have reflected her unwillingness to buy their favorite mantras. Ms. Logan's writing often pierced political rhetoric. Writing about Mayor David N. Dinkins in 1992, for instance, she said:         ''The theme of the speech was a message that the mayor delivers daily, and sometimes more often, at City Hall: that the Reagan-Bush administrations abandoned the nation's cities, and particularly this one, and that the federal government should resume its old, generous (Democratic) ways -- that is, 'Send money.' Back in the years when Nelson Rockefeller was New York's governor, he had a habit of working the phrase 'Brotherhood of Man in the Fatherhood of God' so regularly into speeches that Albany reporters would simply write down 'bomfog'  and turn their attention elsewhere. At the Dinkins City Hall, when the mayor brings up the abandonment of cities, often at considerable length, reporters can write down 'ban-cit' and take five.''         To her colleagues in Room 9, Ms. Logan was a teacher and inspiration. George Arzt, who covered city government for The New York Post for 18 years, recalled his first day on the job, when he was asked to cover the Board of Estimate, which he had never heard of before, and to untangle a complicated question pending before the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.         ''Andy Logan, who I had never met before, took me by the arm and said, 'Why do you have that wild look in your eyes,' and I said, 'I don't know what I'm doing,' '' he recalled. ''And she sat me down, told me what was going on and practically dictated the story to me.''         Ms. Logan kept her office at The New Yorker until the end of her life.         ''She was sort of the institutional memory of the place,'' said John Bennet, an editor at the magazine. Well into her seventies, colleagues said, she could still be found at her desk late into the evening or on Saturday mornings.         Correction:  November 23, 2000, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Andy Logan, the longtime New York City Hall reporter for The New Yorker, referred imprecisely to her tenure. While her column, About City Hall, appeared from 1969 to 1994 and she was the acknowledged dean of the City Hall press corps for the last 20 years of that time, she wrote about municipal affairs both before and after the life of the column.       
         Gwendolyn Brooks, who illuminated the black experience in America in poems that spanned most of the 20th century, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1950, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         ''I wrote about what I saw and heard in the street,'' Ms. Brooks once said. ''I lived in a small second-floor apartment at the corner, and I could look first on one side and then the other. There was my material.''         In Ms. Brooks's early poetry, Chicago's vast black South Side is called Bronzeville. It was ''A Street in Bronzeville,'' her first poetry anthology, that attracted the attention of the literary establishment in 1945.         The Bronzeville poems were recommended to the editors of Harper & Row by Richard Wright, who admired her ability to capture ''the pathos of petty destinies, the whimper of the wounded, the tiny incidents that plague the lives of the desperately poor, and the problems of common prejudice.''         But it was more than Ms. Brooks's ability to write about struggling black people, particularly black women. There was also her mastery of the language of poetry.         ''Miss Brooks has a command over both the colloquial and the more austere rhythms,'' the critic Rolfe Humphries wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the poems in ''A Street in Bronzeville.'' Calling her ''a real poet,'' Mr. Humphries said of her technique, ''There is a range of form: quatrains, free verse, ballads, sonnets -- all appropriately controlled.''         Ms. Brooks said that her reputation was bolstered by a review of ''Bronzeville'' in The Chicago Tribune by Paul Engle, a poet and founder of the Iowa Writers School. Mr. Engle maintained that her poems were no more ''Negro poetry'' than Robert Frost's poetry was ''white poetry.''         Among the poems in ''Bronzeville' was ''the old-marrieds,'' a portrait of an aging couple:         But in the crowding darkness not a word did they say.         Though the pretty-coated birds had piped so lightly all         the day.         And he had seen the lovers in the little side-streets.         And she had heard the morning stories clogged with         sweets.         It was quite a time for loving. It was midnight. It was         May.         But in the crowded darkness not a word did they say.         In ''A Street in Bronzeville'' Ms. Brooks created such indelible figures as the old, alienated Matthew Cole, who could only smile at such memories as ''say, thoughts of a little boy licorice-full/Without a nickel for Sunday School,'' and Satin Legs Smith, awakening on a Sunday:         He sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days.         And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the         Postponed resentments and the prim precautions.         In 1946 and 1947, Ms. Brooks was awarded a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation. In 1949, she published her second volume of verse, ''Annie Allen,'' a portrait of a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother, experiencing loneliness, loss, death and poverty. The critics praised her use of an experimental form she called the sonnet-ballad. ''Full of insight and wisdom and pity, technically dazzling,'' Phyllis McGinley wrote in The Times Book Review.         ''Annie Allen'' won Poetry magazine's Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize in 1949 and the following year, it was awarded the Pulitzer Prize; Ms. Brooks became the first black writer to receive the prize since it was established in 1917. She acknowledged that it transformed her life.         ''That's why I am as well known as I am today,'' she said in a 1987 interview. ''Sometimes,'' she added with a smile, ''I feel that my name is Gwendolyn Pulitzer Brooks.''         Ms. Brooks wrote a novel, ''Maud Martha,'' which received scant consideration when it was published in 1953. ''Maud Martha'' traced the life of a Bronzeville woman from childhood to maturity and motherhood through a series of 34 vignettes.         The reader meets Maud as a lonely, overweight girl of 7, follows her through a dreamy adolescence and finally sees her as a young newlywed living ''in a sad gray building in a cold white world,'' married to a man numbed by his struggle with white society.         But Ms. Brooks's novel was overshadowed by her achievements as a poet and invidiously compared with Richard Wright's ''Native Son'' and Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man,'' epic novels with clear-cut socio-political themes. In recent years, however, ''Maud Martha'' has had a rebirth, and it is now regarded in some critical circles as an important forerunner of prominent themes in the works of today's female writers.         ''Bronzeville Boys and Girls,'' a collection of children's poetry, appeared in 1956, followed by two poetry collections, ''The Bean Eaters'' (1960) and ''Selected Poems'' (1963). Critics noticed that Ms. Brooks's vision was expanding from considerations of the everyday experiences of Bronzeville to a wider world that included the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and the racial tensions in Little Rock in 1957.         They also noticed -- and most applauded -- a sharper colloquial style that was emerging in poems like ''We Real Cool'' from ''The Bean Eaters'':         We real cool. We         Left school. We         Lurk Late. We         Strike straight. We         Sing sin. We         Thin gin. We         Jazz June. We         Die soon.         By the early 1960's, Ms. Brooks had reached a high point in her writing career. She was regarded as a grande dame of America's black writers and an honored member of the literary elite, a sought-after teacher, a poet who was valued for her sensitive portraits of black women, her precise use of language and the universality of her work. But by the end of the decade she had transformed herself and her poetry -- a reflection of the new political dynamics that were sweeping across all the Bronzevilles of America.         Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born in Topeka, Kan., on June 7, 1917, but grew up on the South Side of Chicago, where she remained till she died. Her parents, David Anderson Brooks and the former Keziah Corinne Wims, encouraged her and her younger brother, Raymond, to read and take an interest in culture from an early age.         Gwendolyn began writing poetry before she was a teenager, filling composition books with ''careful rhymes'' and ''lofty meditations.'' Her mother was an enthusiastic supporter, often telling her, ''You are going to be the lady Paul Laurence Dunbar.'' Ms. Brooks published her first poem, ''Eventide,'' in American Childhood when she was 13.         Prompted by her mother, the teenager sent her poems to Langston Hughes and James Weldon Johnson. Mr. Hughes, who would become her friend and longtime supporter, wrote back: ''You have talent. Keep writing! You'll have a book published one day.'' Mr. Johnson also responded with encouragement, urging her to read such modern poets as Wallace Stevens, e.e. cummings and T. S. Eliot. By the age of 16, Ms. Brooks had become a regular contributor to the ''Lights and Shadows'' column of The Chicago Defender, where many of her earliest poems appeared.         Three years after her graduation from the newly opened Woodrow Wilson Junior College in Chicago in 1936, Ms. Brooks married Henry L. Blakely, a young writer who later published a volume of his own poetry. They lived in Chicago for the next 30 years, divorced in 1969 but reunited in 1973. Her survivors include a daughter, Nora Brooks Blakely, and a son, Henry Blakely.         Ms. Brooks's poetry shifted noticeably in form and concern after she attended a conference of black writers at Fisk University in the spring of 1967. While there she listened to readings by Amiri Baraka, Ron Milner and other young firebrand poets. ''I felt that something new was happening,'' she later said.         Those young black writers ''seemed so proud and committed to their own people,'' she added. ''The poets among them felt that black poets should write as blacks, about blacks, and address themselves to blacks.''         She later wrote: ''If it hadn't been for these young people, these young writers who influenced me, I wouldn't know what I know about this society. By associating with them I know who I am.''         Returning to Chicago, she began a poetry workshop in her home that included members of a Chicago street gang called the Blackstone Rangers and younger poets like Sonia Sanchez, Don L. Lee and Nikki Giovanni. Much of the talk was devoted to ways of merging the concept of black art with the political concept of black power.         These currents were evident in Ms. Brooks's next volume of poetry, ''In the Mecca'' (Harper 1968). The 30-page title poem described a mother's frantic search for her missing daughter in a sprawling, decrepit building called the Mecca, which once was one of Chicago's fanciest apartment houses.         In a volume that was described by one critic as ''her declaration of independence'' from the integrationist pursuit that had previously shaped her work, Ms. Brooks wrote about the desperate and tragic lives of the inhabitants of the Mecca. She wrote from experience. Ms. Brooks worked at the real Mecca as a typist for a ''spiritual adviser'' when she was young and got to know the people in the building.         The collection also offered poems about Malcolm X and the Blackstone Rangers:         Black, raw, ready.         Sores in the city         That do not want to heal.         Ms. Brooks used clipped lines, abstract word patterns and random rhymes to capture her new radical tone and her more direct expression of social concern.         ''In the Mecca'' was nominated for a National Book Award.         Asked if the change in work signaled her emergence as a ''protest poet,'' Ms. Brooks said, ''No matter what the theme is, I still want the poem to be a poem, not just a piece of propaganda.'' Ms. Brooks reflected the change in her 1988 poem ''Winnie'':         I am tired of little tight-fisted poems sitting down to         shape perfect unimportant pieces.         Poems that cough lightly -- catch a sneeze.         This is the time for Big Poems         roaring up out of the sleaze,         poems from ice, from vomit, and from tainted blood.         After the publication of ''In the Mecca'' Ms. Brooks left her longtime mainstream publisher, Harper & Row. ''Rio'' (1969), her next volume of poetry, was published by Broadside Press, a small, Detroit-based black company. The change, she said, reflected her desire to support struggling black publishers and the young poets they published as well as her intention to address her work to black readers.         With the new direction of her work and the lack of a major mainstream publisher, however, many of her subsequent books were brushed aside by reviewers for mainstream publications. From the 1970's to the 1990's, she published more than a dozen volumes of poetry and nearly a dozen nonfiction titles, which included two autobiographical works -- ''Report From Part One'' (1972) and ''Report From Part Two'' (1995).         Despite the lack of media attention, Ms. Brooks maintained her reputation as one of America's most respected literary figures. In 1968, she succeeded Carl Sandburg as poet laureate of Illinois. In 1976, she became the first black woman to be elected to the 250-member National Institute of Arts and Letters. She received a lifetime achievement award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1989 and another from the National Book Foundation in 1994. She was the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees.         The Gwendolyn Brooks Chair in Black Literature and Creative Writing was established at Chicago State University in 1990, and there is a Gwendolyn Brooks Center for African-American Literature at Western Illinois University and a Gwendolyn Brooks Junior High School just south of Chicago in Harvey, Ill. She was selected by the National Endowment of the Humanities as its Jefferson Lecturer in 1994 -- ''the absolute award crown of my career,'' she said. And in 1995 she received the National Medal of Arts award.         Despite such praise, Ms. Brooks preferred to stay outside what she called ''the hollow land of fame'' and quietly live and work on the South Side.         ''All my life is not writing,'' Ms. Brooks once told an interviewer. ''My greatest interest is being involved with young people.'' To that end, she devoted much time to giving readings at schools, prisons and hospitals and attending annual poetry contests for school-age youngsters, which she sponsored, judged, and often paid for out of her own pocket.         During her later years, Ms. Brooks tempered her assessment of the young poets of the 60's who had criticized her subjectivity and attention to form. ''Many of the poets felt it was a mark of their quality, of their black and Hispanic quality, if they didn't put a lot of emphasis on technique,'' she said. Although she still sought to write poetry that was ''direct'' and appealed to ''all manner of blacks,'' she insisted on maintaining her own standards.         ''I don't want to imitate these young people,'' she said. ''I have got to find a way of writing that will accomplish my purpose but still sound Gwendolynian.''

All done with seeing her fat little form         Burst out of the basement door;         And with seeing her African son-in-law         (Rightful heir to the throne)         With his great white strong cold squares of teeth         And his little eyes of stone;         And with seeing the squat fat daughter         Letting in the men         When majesty has gone for the day --         And letting them out again.

         Florynce Kennedy, a lawyer and political activist whose flamboyant attire and sometimes outrageous comments drew attention to her fierce struggle for civil rights and feminism, died on Thursday in her Manhattan apartment. She was 84.         Known to everyone as Flo, recognizable everywhere in cowboy hat and pink sunglasses, she was one of the first black women to graduate from Columbia Law School, where she was admitted after threatening a discrimination suit. She fought in the courts and on the streets for abortion rights, represented Black Panthers, was a founding member of the National Women's Political Caucus and led a mass urination by women protesting a lack of women's restrooms at Harvard.         ''If you found a cause for the downtrodden of somebody being abused someplace, by God, Flo Kennedy would be there,'' former Mayor David N. Dinkins of New York said yesterday.         People magazine in 1974 called her ''the biggest, loudest and, indisputably, the rudest mouth on the battleground where feminist activists and radical politics join in mostly common cause.''         Justice Emily Jane Goodman of New York State Supreme Court said Ms. Kennedy gave women courage. ''She showed a whole generation of us the right way to live our lives,'' Justice Goodman said.         Friends like Gloria Steinem reveled in her razor-sharp wit. Ms. Steinem, who lectured with Ms. Kennedy in the 1970's, said a man in the audience would all too often stand up and demand, ''Are you lesbians?''         Ms. Kennedy would respond that it depended. ''Are you my alternative?'' she would ask.         Ms. Steinem said by phone from Hawaii yesterday, ''She understood what Emma Goldman understood: there has to be laughter and fun at the revolution, or it isn't a revolution.''         Marie Wilson, president of the Ms. Foundation, yesterday called Ms. Kennedy ''one of the most wonderfully outrageous pioneers of feminism in America.''         Florynce Rae Kennedy, the second of five daughters, was born on Feb. 11, 1916, in Kansas City, Mo. Her father was a Pullman porter and later owned a taxi business. He once stood up with a shotgun to members of the Ku Klux Klan who wanted to drive him from a home he had bought in a mainly white neighborhood.         In her autobiography, ''Color Me Flo: My Hard Life and Good Times'' (1976), she said her parents almost never criticized their daughters. In fact, they could seemingly do almost no wrong. ''We were taught very early in the game that we didn't have to respect the teachers, and if they threatened to hit us, we could act as if they weren't anybody we had to pay any attention to,'' she wrote.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Kennedy opened a hat shop in Kansas City with her sisters. Within a few years, she was involved in her first political protest, helping organize a boycott when the local Coca-Cola bottler refused to hire black truck drivers.         After the death of her mother, Zella, from cancer, Ms. Kennedy and her sister Grayce moved to New York. Ignoring those who urged her to become a teacher, she enrolled in pre-law courses at Columbia University. ''I find that the higher you aim, the better you shoot,'' she wrote.         She applied to Columbia Law School, but was refused admission. She was told the reason was not that she was black, but that she was a woman. Justice Goodman said she answered, ''To my friends at the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, it all sounds the same.''         After threatening a lawsuit, Ms. Kennedy was admitted. She was one of eight women and the only black in her class. She graduated in 1951 and worked briefly for a Manhattan law firm before opening her own law office in 1954. Business was not good, and she had to take a job at Bloomingdale's one Christmas to pay the rent.         One of her cases involved representing the estates of the jazz greats Billie Holiday and Charlie Parker to recover money owed them by record companies. Even though she won the cases, the experience soured her on the law.         ''Handling the Holiday and Parker estates taught me more than I was really ready for about government and business delinquency and the hostility and helplessness of the courts,'' she wrote. ''Not only was I not earning a decent living, there began to be a serious question in my mind whether practicing law could ever be an effective means of changing society or even of simple resistance to oppression.''         She turned to political activism, setting up an organization called the Media Workshop in 1966 to fight racism in journalism and advertising. Picketing an advertising agency led to the protesters' being invited upstairs to state their case. She said, ''Ever since I've been able to say, 'When you want to get to the suites, start in the streets.' ''         Her strategy became to go after the biggest targets possible. ''Grass-roots organizing is like climbing into bed with a malaria patient in order to show how much you love him or her, then catching malaria yourself,'' she wrote. ''I say if you want to kill poverty, go to Wall Street and kick -- or disrupt.''         Increasingly, her legal cases were almost always political. ''Sweetie,'' she said, ''if you're not living on the edge, then you're taking up space.''         In 1966, she represented H. Rap Brown, the civil rights leader. In 1968, she sued the Roman Catholic Church for what she viewed as interference with abortion. In 1969, she organized a group of feminist lawyers to challenge the constitutionality of New York State's abortion law, an action credited with helping influence the Legislature to liberalize abortion the next year.         In 1969, she helped represent 21 Black Panthers on trial in Manhattan for conspiracy to commit bombings, among other things. They were eventually acquitted, but during the trial she used them for another purpose.         She and Ms. Goodman, not then a judge, and others were renting a house on Fire Island. They decided to take the Panthers to a community on the island for a dinner at a restaurant that did not accept blacks or Jews. It created quite a commotion, the intended effect. But afterward, Ms. Goodman asked if it was all that important, compared with the life and death issues at stake in the trial.         Ms. Kennedy gave an emphatic yes. ''Her point was that you have to fight on all the fronts all the time,'' Justice Goodman said.         Other fronts included founding the Feminist Party in 1971. Its first act was to nominate Representative Shirley Chisholm, Democrat of New York, for president.         In 1967, Ms. Kennedy attended a rally against the Vietnam War in Montreal. Bobby Seale, the Black Panther, was not allowed to speak. ''I went berserk,'' she wrote. ''I took the platform and started yelling and hollering.'' An invitation for Ms. Kennedy to speak in Washington followed, and a 20-year lecturing career was born. She made $3,500 a lecture at her peak.         Ms. Steinem called her lectures with Ms. Kennedy on the college circuit ''the Thelma and Louise of the 70's.'' Ms. Steinem said, ''I definitely speak first because after Flo I would have been an anticlimax.''         In 1957, Ms. Kennedy married Charles Dye, a writer 10 years her junior. He died a few years later. ''Anyone who marries a drunk Welshman doesn't deserve sympathy,'' she once said.         Her views on the exclusivity of marriage were not much brighter. ''Why would you lock yourself in the bathroom just because you have to go three times a day,'' she wrote.         Ms. Kennedy is survived by three sisters, Joy Kennedy Banks of East Orange, N.J., Faye Kennedy Daly of Honolulu and Grayce Kennedy Bayles of Queens.         As her health failed, her spirit did not. In her autobiography, she wrote: ''I'm just a loud-mouthed, middle-aged colored lady with a fused spine and three feet of intestines missing, and a lot of people think I'm crazy. Maybe you do too, but I never stopped to wonder why I'm not like other people. The mystery to me is why more people aren't like me.''       
         Gwendolyn Brooks, who illuminated the black experience in America in poems that spanned most of the 20th century, winning the Pulitzer Prize in 1950, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         ''I wrote about what I saw and heard in the street,'' Ms. Brooks once said. ''I lived in a small second-floor apartment at the corner, and I could look first on one side and then the other. There was my material.''         In Ms. Brooks's early poetry, Chicago's vast black South Side is called Bronzeville. It was ''A Street in Bronzeville,'' her first poetry anthology, that attracted the attention of the literary establishment in 1945.         The Bronzeville poems were recommended to the editors of Harper & Row by Richard Wright, who admired her ability to capture ''the pathos of petty destinies, the whimper of the wounded, the tiny incidents that plague the lives of the desperately poor, and the problems of common prejudice.''         But there was more to Ms. Brooks's talent than the ability to write about struggling black people, particularly women. There was also her mastery of poetry.         ''Miss Brooks has a command over both the colloquial and the more austere rhythms,'' the critic Rolfe Humphries wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the poems in ''A Street in Bronzeville.'' Calling her ''a real poet,'' Mr. Humphries said of her technique, ''There is a range of form: quatrains, free verse, ballads, sonnets -- all appropriately controlled.''         Ms. Brooks said that her reputation was bolstered by a review of ''Bronzeville'' in The Chicago Tribune by Paul Engle, a poet and founder of the Iowa Writers School. Mr. Engle maintained that her poems were no more ''Negro poetry'' than Robert Frost's poetry was ''white poetry.''         Among the poems in ''Bronzeville' was ''the old-marrieds,'' about an aging couple:         But in the crowding darkness not a word did they say.         Though the pretty-coated birds had piped so lightly all         the day.         And he had seen the lovers in the little side-streets.         And she had heard the morning stories clogged with         sweets.         It was quite a time for loving. It was midnight. It was         May.         But in the crowded darkness not a word did they say.         In ''A Street in Bronzeville'' Ms. Brooks created indelible figures like the old, alienated Matthew Cole, who could only smile at such memories as, ''say, thoughts of a little boy licorice-full/Without a nickel for Sunday School,'' and Satin Legs Smith, awakening on a Sunday:         He sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days.         And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the         Postponed resentments and the prim precautions.         In 1946 and 1947 Ms. Brooks was awarded a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation. In 1949  she published her second volume of verse, ''Annie Allen,'' a portrait of a Bronzeville girl as a daughter, a wife and a mother, experiencing loneliness, loss, death and poverty. The critics praised her use of an experimental form she called the sonnet-ballad. ''Full of insight and wisdom and pity, technically dazzling,'' Phyllis McGinley wrote in The Times Book Review.         ''Annie Allen'' won Poetry magazine's Eunice Tietjens Memorial Prize in 1949 and the following year was awarded the Pulitzer Prize; Ms. Brooks became the first black writer to receive the prize since it was established in 1917. She acknowledged that it transformed her life.         ''That's why I am as well known as I am today,'' she said in a 1987 interview. ''Sometimes,'' she added with a smile, ''I feel that my name is Gwendolyn Pulitzer Brooks.''         Ms. Brooks wrote a novel, ''Maud Martha,'' which received scant consideration when it was published in 1953. ''Maud Martha'' traced the life of a Bronzeville woman from childhood to maturity through a series of 34 vignettes.         The reader meets Maud as a lonely, overweight girl of 7, follows her through a dreamy adolescence and finally sees her as a young newlywed living ''in a sad gray building in a cold white world,'' married to a man numbed by his struggle with white society.         But Ms. Brooks's novel was overshadowed by her achievements as a poet and invidiously compared with Richard Wright's ''Native Son'' and Ralph Ellison's ''Invisible Man,'' epic novels with clear-cut socio-political themes. In recent years, however, ''Maud Martha'' has had a rebirth, and it is now regarded in some critical circles as an important forerunner of prominent themes in the works of women writing today.         ''Bronzeville Boys and Girls,'' a collection of children's poetry, appeared in 1956, followed by two poetry collections, ''The Bean Eaters'' (1960) and ''Selected Poems'' (1963). Critics noticed that Ms. Brooks's vision was expanding from considerations of the everyday experiences of Bronzeville to a wider world that included the murder of Emmett Till in Mississippi in 1955 and the racial tensions in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957.         They also noticed -- and most applauded -- a sharper colloquial style that was emerging in poems like ''We Real Cool'' from ''The Bean Eaters'':         We real cool. We         Left school. We         Lurk Late. We         Strike straight. We         Sing sin. We         Thin gin. We         Jazz June. We         Die soon.         By the early 1960's Ms. Brooks had reached a high point in her writing career. She was regarded as a grande dame of America's black writers and an honored member of the literary elite, a sought-after teacher and a poet who was valued for her sensitive portraits of black women, her precise use of language and the universality of her work. But by the end of the decade she had transformed herself and her poetry, a change that reflected the new political dynamics that were sweeping across all the Bronzevilles of America.         Gwendolyn Elizabeth Brooks was born in Topeka, Kan., on June 7, 1917, but grew up on the South Side of Chicago, where she remained until her death. Her parents, David Anderson Brooks and the former Keziah Corinne Wims, encouraged her and her younger brother, Raymond, to read and take an interest in culture from an early age.         She began writing poetry before she was a teenager, filling composition books with ''careful rhymes'' and ''lofty meditations.'' Her mother was an enthusiastic supporter, often telling her, ''You are going to be the lady Paul Laurence Dunbar.'' Ms. Brooks published her first poem, ''Eventide,'' in American Childhood magazine when she was 13.         Prompted by her mother, she sent her poems to Langston Hughes and James Weldon Johnson. Mr. Hughes, who would become her friend and longtime supporter, wrote back: ''You have talent. Keep writing! You'll have a book published one day.'' Mr. Johnson also responded with encouragement, urging her to read modern poets like Wallace Stevens, E. E. Cummings and T. S. Eliot. By the age of 16, Ms. Brooks had become a regular contributor to the ''Lights and Shadows'' column in The Chicago Defender, the newspaper where many of her earliest poems appeared.         Three years after her graduation from the newly opened Woodrow Wilson Junior College in Chicago in 1936, Ms. Brooks married Henry L. Blakely, a young writer who later published a volume of his own poetry. They lived in Chicago for the next 30 years and divorced in 1969, but reunited in 1973. He died in 1996. She is survived by a daughter, Nora Brooks Blakely, of Chicago; a son, Henry Blakely III; and one grandchild.         Ms. Brooks's poetry shifted noticeably in form and concern after she attended a conference of black writers at Fisk University in the spring of 1967. While there she listened to readings by Amiri Baraka, Ron Milner and other young firebrand poets. ''I felt that something new was happening,'' she later said.         Those young black writers ''seemed so proud and committed to their own people,'' she added. ''The poets among them felt that black poets should write as blacks, about blacks, and address themselves to blacks.''         She later wrote: ''If it hadn't been for these young people, these young writers who influenced me, I wouldn't know what I know about this society. By associating with them I know who I am.''         Returning to Chicago, she began a poetry workshop in her home that included members of a Chicago street gang called the Blackstone Rangers and younger poets like Sonia Sanchez, Don L. Lee and Nikki Giovanni. Much of the talk was devoted to ways of merging black art with the political concept of black power.         These currents were evident in Ms. Brooks's next volume of poetry, ''In the Mecca'' (Harper & Row, 1968). The 30-page title poem described a mother's frantic search for her missing daughter in a sprawling, decrepit building called the Mecca, which once was one of Chicago's fanciest apartment houses.         In a volume that was described by one critic as ''her declaration of independence'' from the integrationist philosophy that had previously shaped her work, Ms. Brooks wrote about the desperate and tragic lives of the inhabitants of the Mecca. She wrote from experience. Ms. Brooks worked at the real Mecca as a typist for a ''spiritual adviser'' when she was young and got to know the people in the building.         The collection also offered poems about Malcolm X and the Blackstone Rangers:         Black, raw, ready.         Sores in the city         That do not want to heal.         Ms. Brooks used clipped lines, abstract word patterns and random rhymes to capture her new radical tone and her more direct expression of social concern.         ''In the Mecca'' was nominated for a National Book Award.         Asked if the change in her work signaled her emergence as a ''protest poet,'' Ms. Brooks said, ''No matter what the theme is, I still want the poem to be a poem, not just a piece of propaganda.'' Ms. Brooks reflected on her approach in her 1988 poem ''Winnie'':         I am tired of little tight-fisted poems sitting down to         shape perfect unimportant pieces.         Poems that cough lightly -- catch a sneeze.         This is the time for Big Poems         roaring up out of the sleaze,         poems from ice, from vomit, and from tainted blood.         After the publication of ''In the Mecca,'' Ms. Brooks left her longtime mainstream publisher, Harper & Row. ''Rio'' (1969), her next volume of poetry, was published by Broadside Press, a small, Detroit-based black company. The change, she said, reflected her desire to support struggling black publishers and the young poets they published as well as her intention to address black readers.         With the new direction of her work and the lack of a major mainstream publisher, however, many of her subsequent books were brushed aside by reviewers for mainstream publications. From the 1970's to the 1990's she published more than a dozen volumes of poetry and nearly a dozen nonfiction titles, which included two autobiographical works, ''Report From Part One'' (1972) and ''Report From Part Two'' (1995).         Despite the lack of news media attention, Ms. Brooks maintained her reputation as one of America's most respected literary figures. In 1968 she succeeded Carl Sandburg as poet laureate of Illinois. In 1976 she became the first black woman to be elected to the 250-member National Institute of Arts and Letters. She received a lifetime achievement award from the National Endowment for the Arts in 1989 and another from the National Book Foundation in 1994. She was the recipient of more than 50 honorary degrees.         The Gwendolyn Brooks Chair in Black Literature and Creative Writing was established at Chicago State University in 1990, and there is a Gwendolyn Brooks Center for African-American Literature at Western Illinois University and a Gwendolyn Brooks Junior High School just south of Chicago in Harvey, Ill. She was selected by the National Endowment of the Humanities as its Jefferson Lecturer in 1994, ''the absolute award crown of my career,'' she said. And in 1995 she received the National Medal of Arts award.         Despite such praise, Ms. Brooks preferred to stay outside what she called ''the hollow land of fame'' and quietly live and work on the South Side.         ''All my life is not writing,'' Ms. Brooks once told an interviewer. ''My greatest interest is being involved with young people.'' To that end, she gave many readings at schools, prisons and hospitals and attended annual poetry contests for school-age youngsters, which she sponsored, judged and often paid for out of her own pocket.         During her later years, Ms. Brooks tempered her assessment of the young poets of the 60's who had criticized her subjectivity and attention to form. ''Many of the poets felt it was a mark of their quality, of their black and Hispanic quality, if they didn't put a lot of emphasis on technique,'' she said.  Although she still sought to write poetry that was ''direct'' and appealed to ''all manner of blacks,'' she insisted on her own standards.         ''I don't want to imitate these young people,'' she said. ''I have got to find a way of writing that will accomplish my purpose but still sound Gwendolynian.''
