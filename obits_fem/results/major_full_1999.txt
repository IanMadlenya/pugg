         Susan Strasberg, who at 17 electrified Broadway with her luminous portrayal of the title role of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' and -- with highs and lows professional and private -- went on to a career onstage and in movies, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 and also had a home in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her stepmother, Anna Strasberg.         As the daughter of Lee Strasberg, the director of the Actors Studio, and the acting coach Paula Miller, Ms. Strasberg spent her childhood surrounded by celebrated figures of the American theater, people who were, she said, ''supremely talented, alive, sensitive, eccentric, and some were neurotic and miserable.''         When she made her Broadway debut as Anne Frank in 1955, she was unknown, except for her last name. She had appeared in an Off Broadway play and had acted in two films, ''The Cobweb'' and ''Picnic,'' that had not been released. And she had never studied acting with her father.         With a naturalness and an authority that belied her limited theatrical experience, she was an astonishing success in her first major role. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson characterized her as ''a slender, enchanting young lady with a heart-shaped face, a pair of burning eyes and the soul of an actress.''         Ms. Strasberg's father was among those surprised by her performance. He and his wife had tried to talk to her about the interpretation of the role, but then left her to work on her own and with her director, Garson Kanin. ''When we saw Susie in action  we were all amazed at her great sensitivity,'' Mr. Strasberg said at the time. ''I just don't know how she picked it all up. She's never had any formal training.''         Ms. Strasberg was born in Manhattan, and her birth announcement heralded her as ''a four-star hit.'' After working briefly as a model, she made her theatrical debut Off Broadway in ''Maya,'' and followed that with several roles on television, including ''Romeo and Juliet,'' live on the Kraft Television Theater.         She auditioned for the role of Anne Frank, but the producer Kermit Bloomgarden made no decision about casting and the show was postponed. When the play was rescheduled in 1955, Ms. Strasberg was in Hollywood acting in the film of William Inge's ''Picnic.'' Mr. Bloomgarden and Albert and Frances Hackett, the authors of the play ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' asked her to read for the role again.         ''Susan was so terrified at the thought of being rejected that she declined to read at all,'' Mr. Bloomgarden had said in an interview. ''Finally, with tears in her eyes, Susan did read the last, touching scene from play. Within 10 minutes, she knew the part was hers.''         The play was an enormous hit, running for two years and winning the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the New York Drama Critics award and Tony Award for best play. Within the year, she was a certified Broadway star, with her name above the title on the Cort Theater marquee.         In 1957 she starred with Richard Burton and Helen Hayes in Jean Anouilh's ''Time Remembered.'' The next year she was in the Actors Studio revival of Sean O'Casey's ''Shadow of a Gunman'' and then she toured with Franchot Tone in ''Caesar and Cleopatra.'' In 1963 she returned to Broadway in the title role of Franco Zeffirelli's production of ''The Lady of the Camellias.'' When her first two films were released, she was on her way to movie stardom, and was soon playing opposite Henry Fonda in ''Stage Struck.''         Within several years, her career had crested and her private life was in turmoil. In the early 1960's she  was using a wide variety of drugs. When she wrote her autobiography in 1980, it was titled ''Bittersweet,'' a word that seemed to sum up her life. Her marriage to the actor Christopher Jones had ended. Her daughter, Jennifer, was born with a congenital birth defect: Ms. Strasberg blamed herself even though there was no medical evidence linking the drugs and the daughter's disabilities.         A reason she wrote her book, she  said, was that her career was stalled: ''It become totally untenable to me that after acting for 25 years -- I've played Juliet, Cleopatra and Anne Frank -- there I was, sitting in Hollywood, just waiting for somebody to want me.'' Her films include ''Kapo,'' ''The Trip,'' ''Manitou,'' ''Delta Force'' and ''Prime Suspect.'' In the book, she criticized her father for being preoccupied with his acting classes and she criticized her mother for being overly supervisory about her daughter's work.         She was also close to some of her father's students, especially Marilyn Monroe, whom she wrote about in ''Bittersweet'' and in her 1992 book, ''Marilyn and Me, Sisters, Rivals and Friends.''         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Strasberg is survived by her brother, John, who lives in Paris and New York, and by two half-brothers.         Even as Ms. Strasberg's life spiraled, those who saw her in her Broadway debut remembered her as the image of Anne Frank. After that opening night performance, she entered Sardi's with her parents, followed by Ms. Monroe. Before the reviews were read, Mr. Tone offered a toast: ''Little Susan, you have been launched on a long and glittering career.''       
         Mirra Komarovsky, a sociologist who was an innovative authority on gender, family and education, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 93.         Professor Komarovsky retired in 1970 after 32 years on the faculty of Barnard College. But she returned to Barnard in 1978 and became the chairwoman of its women's studies program for a time.         She was an advocate for women who has been credited with having initiated the contemporary analysis of gender roles with her book ''Women in the Modern World: Their Education and Their Dilemmas'' (1953, Irvington).         In that work she wrote that by making the purposes of women's education clearer, barriers to the attainment of a good life could be removed. As to the respective merits of training for a career and of education meant only for a homemaker, she wrote: ''To disagree with the antifeminist does not necessarily make one a feminist. We can reject the antifeminist program without having to embrace the old-fashioned feminism with its militant hostility towards, and its disparagement of, the homemaker.''         In 1991, Ellen V. Futter, who was Barnard's president at the time, said Professor Komarovsky's ''research has been crucial to our understanding of today's women and the choices they make.''         In that year Professor Komarovsky received the Distinguished Career Award of the American Sociological Association. Earlier, in 1973 and 1974, she was the second female president of the association, which was founded in 1905.         In her book ''Women in College: Shaping New Feminine Identities'' (1985) she described changing views of work, family and men that were held by students in the class of 1983 at Barnard, a women's college.         Reviewing that book in The New York Times Book Review, Adele Simmons, then president of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., wrote: ''The impact of the women's movement on higher education becomes apparent to even the most skeptical reader.'' She noted that Professor Komarovsky observed bleakly that, as Dr. Simmons put it, ''while attitudes have changed, institutions have not. The gains of the last decade, she warns, will only be secure when society develops permanent measures to support women in the workplace as well as in the home.''         In researching the book, Professor Komarovsky used interviews, questionnaires and surveys to study the attitudes of more than 200 students in the Barnard class of 1983. Fully two-thirds of those young women were afflicted with what she called ''culture shock'' that differed from student to student. As Dr. Simmons put it, ''Ideas about virginity, femininity, sexual preferences and study habits all came under scrutiny as students' friendships evolved and intellectual challenges arose.''         Professor Komarovsky found that 76 percent of the female students planned, at the time they entered Barnard, on combining career, marriage and children in the coming years. And by the time the class graduated, fully 85 percent of its members had come to have that threefold ambition.         Two observations of Professors Komarovsky's that Dr. Simmons found intriguing were her finding that the most highly career-minded students had mothers who had not worked and regretted it -- or mothers who worked and enjoyed it; and her suggestion that the young women sought a mixture of sensitivity, self-awareness and masculinity in men.         Professor Komarovsky also found that most of the women she surveyed found it hard to attain relationships that they considered satisfactory with men, although those women had had chances to interact with men from a variety of backgrounds.         Rather similarly, Professor Komarovsky wrote, on the New York Times Op-Ed page in 1981: ''Young women are becoming aware that the call to equal opportunities for women outside the home is an empty slogan as long as the society insists on traditional role segregation within the family. Some women react to this discovery with equanimity, others with frustration, resignation or indignation. But the real touchstone of their aspirations is the longing for a society in which the rhetoric of equality will be realized as fact. There is no denying that this would require major institutional changes.''         What to do? ''We have much to learn from Sweden,'' Professor Komarovsky wrote: ''Modified work patterns for both sexes, housing patterns permitting more-cooperative ties among child-rearing families, accessible child-care centers of high quality for all economic classes.''         Over the years, she also wrote about various aspects of sociology, including theory and methodology.         She was born in Baku, on the Caspian Sea, in what was then Russia, to Mendel Komarovsky and the former Anna Steinberg, and she was raised largely in Baku. When she was 17, she and her family emigrated to the United States. She attended a high school for a year in Wichita, Kan., where some members of her family lived, and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in 1926 from Barnard, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was taught by the anthropologists Ruth Benedict and Franz Boas.         Nonetheless, as the book ''Women in Sociology'' (1991, Greenwood), edited by Mary Jo Deegan, reports: ''Komarovsky was puzzled'' by Barnard's ''extolling intellectual excellence while discouraging women from pursuing careers.''         She received a master's degree in 1927 and a doctorate in 1940, both in sociology, and both from Columbia. Her doctoral thesis was published as a book, ''The Unemployed Man and His Family'' (1940).         Earlier, she was a co-author of the book ''Leisure: A Suburban Study'' (1934). In addition, before joining the Barnard faculty as an instructor in 1938, she taught at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and was a research assistant at the Yale University Institute of Human Relations, at Columbia, and at the International Institute of Social Research in New York.         She was chairman of the sociology department at Barnard from 1949 to 1968 and was president of the Eastern Sociological Society in 1955 and 1956.         But she recalled years later that in the 1940's and even later, choosing women's issues to do research on was at a cost to her. The field lacked academic glamor and was not likely to further a career.         An early marriage, in 1926, ended in divorce in 1928. In 1940, she married Marcus A. Heyman, who died in 1970.         Her survivors include a sister, Dolly Cheser of Rockville Centre, L.I., and five nieces and one nephew.       
         Gertrude B. Elion, a pioneer in drug research who shared a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988, died on Sunday in Chapel Hill, N.C., where she lived. She was 81.         Ms. Elion developed drugs for use in a vast array of conditions. They included drugs for herpes, leukemia, malaria, gout, immune disorders, and AIDS, and immune suppressants to overcome rejection of donated organs in transplant surgery. In perfecting one compound after another, Ms. Elion worked for four decades with Dr. George H. Hitchings, who died a year ago.         Ms. Elion broke down sex barriers in the male-dominated world of scientific research, becoming one of the rare women to win a Nobel Prize and, even rarer, a scientist who did not have a doctorate.         Ms. Elion shared the Prize with Dr. Hitchings, who hired her as a $50-a-week assistant in 1944. Also sharing the Prize was Sir James Black of Britain, who discovered two classes of drugs, beta blockers, for high blood pressure and heart disease, and H-2 antagonists, for ulcers.         Seldom does the Nobel committee in Stockholm honor employees of pharmaceutical companies, but all three that year worked or had worked for such a company. Ms. Elion and Dr. Hitchings collaborated throughout their careers at the company known today as Glaxo Wellcome. In awarding the Prize to the three scientists, the Nobel committee said their work ''had a more fundamental significance than their discovery of individual drugs.''         Ms. Elion was noted for her precise work, intellectual brilliance and ability to work with others.         Few scientists matched the wide array of drugs that Ms. Elion and Dr. Hitchings developed. The drugs include acyclovir (Zovirax) for herpes; azathioprine (Imuran) to help prevent rejection of transplanted organs and in treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis; allopurinol (Zyloprim) for gout; pyrimethamine (Daraprim) for malaria and trimethoprim (a component of Septra) for bacterial infections.         The two worked in lock step for much of their careers, but Dr. Hitchings was always one step ahead of Ms. Elion; as he moved into a new job, she filled the old one.         The two scientists wrote many papers together, sometimes with her name first, sometimes his. As Ms. Elion said, ''He had two arms of research and I was one of them.''         In 1991, President George Bush awarded Ms. Elion a National Medal of Science, saying her work had ''transformed the world.''         Gertrude Belle Elion was born in New York City on Jan. 23, 1918, and graduated with highest honors in chemistry from Hunter College in 1937. Ms. Elion decided to go into medical research as a teen-ager after her grandfather died of cancer and her father, a dentist and Lithuanian immigrant, encouraged her to develop a career. Her mother was from Russia.         But unable to find a laboratory position because she was a woman, Ms. Elion took a succession of jobs. First, she worked as a laboratory assistant in biochemistry. Then she worked as a food analyst, checking the acidity of pickles and making sure the berries slated for jam were not moldy. Next, she taught chemistry and physics in the New York City school system before earning a master's degree in chemistry at New York University in 1941.         After working for Johnson & Johnson for two years, Ms. Elion, helped by labor shortages in World War II, joined what was then Wellcome Research Laboratories, in Tuckahoe, N.Y., as a biochemist. Ms. Elion later became head of the company's experimental therapy department.         She retired in 1983, but continued working, helping to oversee work on the development of AZT as the first drug against H.I.V., the AIDS virus. Ms. Elion also served on the faculty of Duke University and the University of North Carolina.         While working for the drug company, Ms. Elion felt that her lack of a doctorate was a disadvantage, so she began a Ph.D. program at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. She took courses at night, commuting an hour and a half each way. But she eventually had to quit because she was told she would have to attend school full time to get a Ph.D., and she could not afford to give up her job.         When she gave her first scientific paper at a major meeting, she said she got into an argument with a distinguished scientist and stood her ground because ''I knew I was right.''         Ms. Elion never married. She was once engaged, but her fiance died of a heart infection. Ms. Elion said she would not have advanced in her career if she had chosen to marry and have children because women were not encouraged then to work while their children were young.       
         Joann Grillo, a mezzo-soprano who sang in nearly 300 performances with the Metropolitan Opera over a career of some 20 years, died on Monday at Victory Memorial Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 59 and lived in Brooklyn.         She had been recuperating from recent surgery when she suffered a heart attack, said a friend and associate, Samantha La Viale.         Born on May 14, 1939, in New York, Ms. Grillo first won attention as a singer with the Brooklyn Opera Company in the early 1960's. Reviewing her portrayal of Azucena in Verdi's ''Trovatore'' in 1961, Eric Salzman wrote in The New York Times, ''She showed a voice of size and quality, and she knew how to use it.''         She made her Met debut as Rosette in Massenet's ''Manon'' in the fall of 1963. Though she sang occasional leading roles at the Met (Carmen and Azucena among them), her value to the company was as a dependable, dramatically involving singer of supporting roles, like Maddalena in Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' and Grimgerde in Wagner's ''Walkure.''         With other international companies she was heard in major mezzo-soprano roles, including Massenet's Charlotte and Verdi's Eboli.         In 1981, she and her husband, Richard Kness, a dramatic tenor, founded the Ambassadors of Opera and Concert Worldwide, an independent company that brought opera, musicals and vocal concerts to places as distant as Singapore, Guam, Malaysia, Pakistan and the Fiji Islands. The tours were filled with adventure, Ms. Grillo once said in an interview. As singing actors, she and her husband had to die standing up on tiny stages, and they once had to pry a member of their company from an Asian sewer. When they performed in Beijing one month after the 1989 crackdown in Tiananmen Square, they drew  criticism in the international press.         Ms. Grillo is survived by her husband and a son, Jonathan, a tenor.       
         Muriel Bentley, an early member of Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater) who was praised for her comic gifts and witty dancing, died on Monday at the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 82 and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Bentley was probably best known for her long association with Jerome Robbins. She originated the role of the sassy, purse-toting woman in Robbins's ''Fancy Free.'' Speaking of the character in an interview in The New York Times last year, Ms. Bentley probably inadvertently described her own great charm best. ''My role was modeled after me,'' she said. ''The way I walked, the way I talked. It was like patent leather, shiny and bright and crisp.''         She also performed lead roles in major ballets by Agnes de Mille and Antony Tudor at Ballet Theater, where she danced as a company member from 1940 to 1946 and as a guest artist from 1954 to 1956.         Ms. Bentley created the role of the villainous Stepmother in ''Fall River Legend,'' de Mille's 1948 ballet about Lizzie Borden. Describing the character as ''an incarnation of evil,'' John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, commented that Ms. Bentley had played the role so superbly that ''if the girl had not committed the murder herself almost anybody in the audience would gladly have done it for her.'' She also appeared as a risque young lady in de Mille's 1943 ballet ''Tally-Ho.''         Born in New York, Ms. Bentley studied with teachers like Vecheslav Swoboda, Leon Fokine, Anton Dolin and Ruth St. Denis, and also trained at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School. While still a teen-ager, she danced with St. Denis in 1931 in ''The Prophetess.'' In 1936-37, she performed Spanish dance with Jose Greco, moving on to the Metropolitan Opera Ballet before joining Ballet Theater.         At Ballet Theater, Ms. Bentley also danced major roles in Leonide Massine's ''Capriccio Espagnol,'' in de Mille's ''Three Virgins and a Devil,'' and in Tudor's ''Judgment of Paris,'' ''Undertow'' and ''Gala Performance.'' Ms. Bentley joined Robbins's Ballets: U.S.A. in 1958, performing in ballets that included ''N.Y. Export: Op. Jazz,'' ''The Concert'' and ''Moves.''         Ms. Bentley also performed in Broadway musicals, among them ''Call Me Madam'' and ''West Side Story.''         Ms. Bentley retired from the stage in the early 1960's and worked for a time in New York as an interior designer and a theatrical agent before moving to Los Angeles in the 1970's.         She continued to work into the late 1980's in performing arts management.         She has no immediate survivors.       
         Muriel Bentley, an early member of Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater) who was praised for her comic gifts and witty dancing, died on March 8 at the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif.

         Dr. Hildegard Elizabeth Peplau, a nursing educator who played a major role in developing the theory and practice of psychiatric and mental health nursing, died on March 17 at her home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. She was 89.         Dr. Peplau wrote a seminal text, ''Interpersonal Relations in Nursing: A Conceptual Frame of Reference for Psychodynamic Nursing,''  which was completed in 1948 and published in 1952. It was translated into several languages and left an impact in much of the world.         She introduced the concept of nurse-patient relationship, an interpersonal approach that has since been integrated into nursing education and practice. With this, she was considered a force in elevating nursing to a profession.         Colleagues regarded Dr. Peplau as the ''mother of psychiatric nursing,'' said Dr. Grayce M. Sills, professor emeritus at the Ohio State University College of Nursing and a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing.         Referring to the general acceptance of Dr. Peplau's interpersonal process, Dr. Sills added, ''It has been argued that Dr. Peplau's life and work produced the greatest changes in nursing practice since Florence Nightingale.''         Dr. Peplau's book was also deemed highly unusual at the time because it had been written by a nurse, without a physician as a co-author. Its English version remains in print with a 1991 edition from Springer.         Dr. Peplau was born in Reading, Pa., and witnessed the deadly influenza epidemic of 1918, which defined her understanding of the impact of illness and death on families.         She graduated from Pottstown Hospital School of Nursing in 1931 and from Bennington College in 1942. She served in the Army Nurse Corps as a first lieutenant in World War II and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1947 and a doctorate in education in 1953.         She studied psychology for a certificate from the William Alanson White Institute (1953), and that study inspired her to adapt the interpersonal approach for the nursing profession.         Dr. Peplau directed the graduate program of psychiatric nursing at Columbia Teachers College from 1948 to 1953 and its counterpart at Rutgers University after that. She retired from Rutgers as a professor emeritus in 1974.         She lectured worldwide and wrote articles for many publications. She was also executive director and president of the American Nurses Association, which inducted her into its Hall of Fame last year, and was a board member of the International Council of Nurses, which honored her with its highest award, the Christiane Reimann Prize, in 1997.         Dr. Peplau is survived by a sister, Bertha Reppert, of Mechanicsburg, Pa., and a foster brother, John D. Forster, of Reading.       
         Dusty Springfield, the smoky-voiced English torch singer whose interpretations of pop ballads were suffused with a heartbroken wistfulness, died on Tuesday at her home in Henley-on-Thames, near Oxford, west of London. She was 59.         The cause was breast cancer, said her agent, Paul Fenn.         Ms. Springfield had one of the longest recording careers of any contemporary pop star, beginning in 1961 when she had the first of several hits with her folk-pop trio, the Springfields, and ending with her 1995 album, ''A Very Fine Love.'' She had most of her major hits in the 1960's when she was considered the British equivalent of Dionne Warwick and recorded only intermittently after the early 1970's.         Her career was briefly rejuvenated in 1987 when the English duo the Pet Shop Boys (Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe), who were longtime fans, produced her Top Five hit, ''What Have I Done to Deserve This?'' They also wrote and produced ''Nothing Has Been Proved,'' the dense, swirling post-disco theme song that she sang on the soundtrack of the 1989 movie ''Scandal,'' about the Profumo sex scandal that had rocked the British Government.         Ms. Springfield became an international pop star in 1964 with ''I Only Want to Be With You,'' a perky early-Beatles-style love song. Other major 60's hits included ''Wishin' and Hopin' '' (1964), and ''The Look of Love'' (1967), both written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, the team that supplied Ms. Warwick with most of her early hits. Ms. Springfield's sultry rendition of ''The Look of Love,'' from the soundtrack of ''Casino Royale,'' anticipated the heavy-breathing eroticism of Donna Summer a decade later.         Her best seller, ''You Don't Have to Say You Love Me'' (1966), was a big-belting tear-jerker that reached No. 4 on Billboard's singles chart and won her her first Grammy nomination. The country-soul ballad ''Son of a Preacher Man,'' her Top 10 hit from 1969, won her new respect and her second Grammy nomination after being prominently featured in the 1994 movie ''Pulp Fiction.''         Dusty Springfield was born Mary Isabel Catherine Bernadette O'Brien on April 16, 1939, in Hampstead, London. While attending British convent schools, she discovered the music of Peggy Lee, whose intimate come-hither style was a major formative influence.         She got her professional start with an Andrews Sisters-style group called the Lana Sisters, but quit to form her own folk-pop group, the Springfields, with a friend, Tim Field, and her brother, Dion O'Brien, now known as Tom Springfield, who is her only survivor. Promoted as a British answer to Peter, Paul and Mary, the group had a popular British television show and scored several English hits before breaking through in the United States with a Top 20 single, ''Silver Threads and Golden Needles.''         While visiting New York with the trio, Ms. Springfield recalled many years later, she heard the Exciters' brash, aggressive song ''Tell Him'' coming out of a Broadway record store and decided that she wanted to go pop.         ''I was deeply influenced by black singers from the early 1960's,'' she said. ''I liked everybody at Motown and most of the Stax artists. I really wanted to be Mavis Staples. What they shared in common was a kind of strength I didn't hear on English radio.''         Ms. Springfield subsequently broke up her folk group and signed as a soloist with Philips Records. Her first single for the label, ''I Only Want to Be With You,'' established her new direction. Ms. Springfield, with her teased beehive hairdo and eyes heavily blackened with mascara, was a 1960's pop fashion icon. From 1964 and 1967, when she left Philips, 11 of her singles hit the American pop charts.         ''Son of a Preacher Man,'' a song that Aretha Franklin had rejected but later recorded, became Ms. Springfield's first single for Atlantic Records and was featured on her Atlantic debut album, ''Dusty in Memphis,'' which is widely regarded as a pop masterpiece. To make the album, the Atlantic producing team of Jerry Wexler, Tom Dowd and Arif Mardin, who had brought Ms. Franklin to her peak of popularity, took Ms. Springfield to Memphis to record with a hot rhythm section.         The record, which included ''The Windmills of Your Mind,'' an early collaboration of Michel Legrand with the lyricists Alan and Marilyn Bergman that was written for the movie ''The Thomas Crown Affair,'' was a perfect blend of warm country-soul and New York pop sophistication. For many singers, including Melissa Manchester, Linda Ronstadt and K. D. Lang, it provided a blueprint for stylistically adventurous vocal showcases.         But ''Dusty in Memphis'' was not a big hit, reaching only No. 99 on Billboard's album chart. In 1970 Atlantic released her much-admired rhythm-and-blues-flavored album, ''A Brand New Me.'' Recorded in Philadelphia, the album fared no better than its forerunner.         Thereafter Ms. Springfield, who was awarded the Order of the British Empire in January, recorded only sporadically. Although her subsequent American albums -- ''Cameo'' (1973, ABC-Dunhill), ''It Begins Again'' (1978, United Artists), ''Living Without Your Love'' (1979, United Artists), ''White Heat'' (1982, Casablanca) and ''A Very Fine Love'' (1995, Columbia) -- found her voice as full and compelling as ever, the material and production rarely matched the singing.         After the 1970's she led a peripatetic existence, living sometimes in Los Angeles, at other times in the Netherlands and Britain. In 1997 Mercury Records released the 3-CD, 77-song ''Dusty Springfield Anthology Collection.'' Last month Rhino Records released an expanded version of ''Dusty in Memphis.''       
         Harriet M. Waddy, one of the two highest-ranking black officers in the Women's Army Corps in World War II and its wartime adviser on racial issues, died on Feb. 21 in Las Vegas, Nev. She was 94.         In April 1943, First Officer Harriet West, as Harriet Waddy was then known, made a radio broadcast on behalf of the Army, urging black women to get into uniform.         She said that joining the segregated military ''and accepting a situation which does not represent an ideal of democracy'' was not ''a retreat from our fight'' but ''our contribution to its realization.''         The 6,500 black women who joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, created in 1942, and the organization that succeeded it a year later, the Women's Army Corps, joined an institution in which segregation was the official policy. Many were used as uniformed domestic servants, assigned to cleaning officers' clubs. Harriet West tried to ease their distress after she was promoted to major and named an aide to the WAC director, Col. Oveta Culp Hobby.         Major West and Maj. Charity Adams, who commanded the only unit of black Wacs sent overseas in World War II, were the only two black women to attain the rank of major in the wartime WAC.         ''Harriet was charming,'' Charity Adams Earley recalled last week from her home in Dayton, Ohio. ''She looked good, and she was well-disciplined, as we were all trained to be.''         Major West's composure must have been sorely tested when she was dispatched to the South to hear the grievances of black Wacs.         Lula Jones Garrett, a reporter for The Philadelphia Afro-American, who accompanied Major West on a trip from Atlanta to Fort McClellan in Anniston, Ala., in 1944, wrote how Major West ''had been insulted by a white conductor whom she had asked to hand her baggage from the train.''         Major West fought racially insulting Army decrees. On a visit to Wacs at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, she recommended that ''all reference to white and colored personnel be completely eliminated'' from official memorandums on information boards. She said that would bring ''less embarrassment to the colored personnel'' and a ''feeling that a forward step has been made toward democracy.''         Service in the wartime military, in her view, would help blacks gain acceptance. She said that military service would give black women a chance to ''show their ability'' and be ''of future benefit to the whole race.''         Harriet M. Hardin was born in Jefferson City, Mo., on June 20, 1904, and brought up by a grandmother after her mother died. A graduate of Kansas State University, she worked during the Depression as an aide to Mary McLeod Bethune, the director of the National Youth Administration's Division of Negro Affairs and later a civilian adviser to the WAC.         She entered the WAC officer candidate school at Fort Des Moines in 1942. She was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1948 and retired from the armed forces in 1952. Then she worked for the Federal Aviation Administration and counseled troubled girls at a Job Corps center in Oregon.         A longtime resident of Eugene, Ore., Mrs. Waddy moved to Las Vegas in 1998 to live with a friend, Barbara Connolly, when her health declined. She was married four times but left no immediate survivors. In the war years, she was married to Dr. Charles West, a physician. She and her fourth husband, Maj. Edward Waddy, were divorced.         Another friend, Marie Marshall of Eugene, recalled how Mrs. Waddy was still bowling and driving a car into her 90's. Mrs. Marshall viewed her as a strong and independent woman who said, ''The Frank Sinatra song 'My Way' was just perfect.''       
         Patricia Bowman, a founding member of American Ballet Theater, a ballerina of the Radio City Music Hall and the first American ballerina to win critical acclaim and wide popularity as a classical and a musical-theater dancer, died on March 18 in Las Vegas, Nev., her home since 1977. She was believed to be in her early to mid 90's.         A link between two eras of dance, Ms. Bowman began her career when there were no major American ballet companies. She performed on Broadway and in the elaborate live shows offered at motion-picture palaces of the 1920's and 30's. Her sparkling stage personality won her many fans. Yet when American ballet companies began to flourish, she gave authoritative performances in some of the great classics.         A native of Washington, Ms. Bowman studied with various teachers there and in New York and Europe. She became a protegee of Michel Fokine, the Russian ballet choreographer of ''Les Sylphides,'' ''Petrouchka'' and other works, who settled in New York in 1923. Fokine choreographed solos for her, among them ''Tennis,'' a witty sketch she offered in vaudeville shows and as a guest artist with ballet troupes.         Ms. Bowman made her New York debut in the 1920 edition of the revue ''George White's Scandals.'' For many years, she went back and forth between dance forms, touring with the Fokine Ballet, forming a ballroom dance team with Tony de Marco, appearing in pioneering television productions in 1931 and 1939 and serving as ballerina of the Roxy Theater. When Radio City Music Hall opened in 1932, she was appointed its prima ballerina and she continued to perform there occasionally until the early 1950's. She also appeared in the ''Ziegfeld Follies'' of 1934 and with the Mordkin Ballet in 1938.         During the first season of Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater) in 1940, she starred in ''Swan Lake,'' ''Giselle,'' ''Les Sylphides'' and other works. Reviewing Ms. Bowman in ''Giselle,'' John Martin wrote in The New York Times that ''besides dancing with complete authority she achieves a dramatic credibility in the difficult first act that very few Giselles can match.'' She returned as guest artist during Ballet Theater's 15th-anniversary season in 1955 and was partnered by Erik Bruhn in ''Les Sylphides.''         After leaving Ballet Theater in 1941, she appeared on Broadway in ''Rhapsody'' in 1944, performed nationwide with opera companies and was a guest dancer at orchestral concerts. She was hostess for the ''Patricia Bowman Show,'' a 13-week CBS television series in 1951. Ms. Bowman directed a ballet school in New York from 1957 until 1977, when she married Albert Kaye and moved to Las Vegas, where she served as a consultant to local dance groups.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Dr. Mary D. Ainsworth, a developmental psychologist whose work revolutionized the understanding of the bond between mothers and infants, died in Charlottesville, Va., on March 21. She was 85.         Dr. Ainsworth's research contributed significantly to attachment theory, which emphasizes the importance of intimate human relationships, or attachments, in shaping children's development.         Dr. Ainsworth, who lived in Charlottesville, worked closely with Dr. John Bowlby, the British child psychiatrist whose work on separation, attachment and loss provided the foundation for attachment theory. She carried on his legacy in the United States, conducting systematic studies of attachments between mothers and infants.         ''No one had ever looked at that'' before Dr. Ainsworth's work, said Jude A. Cassidy, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Maryland at College Park. ''There had been little empirical observation.''         Dr. Ainsworth also developed methods for assessing the quality of the mother-infant bond. Attachment theory holds that infants need a ''secure'' attachment to thrive, and that ''anxious'' attachments can lead to problems later in life. ''She looked at a way of measuring which babies were securely attached and which were not,'' Dr. Cassidy said.         Though much of Dr. Ainsworth's research was for an academic audience, it also had a practical side. She argued, on the basis of her research, that picking up a crying baby does not spoil the child; rather, it reduces crying in the future.         ''That was a huge controversy over that,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''It had been thought that picking up a baby spoiled it and led to more crying. Instead, it teaches the baby that the world is a responsive place and leads to less crying long term.''         Psychologists continue to debate the issue.         Dr. Ainsworth's research also found that feeding an infant on demand rather than on a strict schedule led to a more secure attachment between infant and mother.         ''These findings had a big impact on how pediatricians advised mothers in the second half of the 20th century,'' said Robert S. Marvin, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia.         Mary D. Salter was born in Glendale, Ohio, on Dec. 1, 1913, and spent most of her childhood in Toronto. She received her bachelor's degree in 1935, her master's degree in 1936 and her Ph.D. in 1939, all from the University of Toronto. She then was a lecturer in the university's psychology department until 1942, when she was commissioned in the Canadian Women's Army Corps, attaining the rank of major. She returned to the university as an assistant professor in 1946.         In 1950 she married Leonard Ainsworth, a graduate student in psychology. Shortly after their marriage she moved to London, where she began a lifelong partnership with Dr. Bowlby, who was investigating the impact on institutionalized children of prolonged separation from their mothers in early childhood. Dr. Ainsworth later moved to Kampala, Uganda, where she conducted one of the first studies of mother-infant interaction in the first year of life.         In 1955 she moved to Baltimore, where she joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. She became a full professor there in 1963, a year after she began her study of infant-mother attachment. In the study, she and her researchers conducted four-hour home visits every three weeks for a year with 26 mothers and their infants. It took four years to collect the data and 10 years to analyze it.         ''The depth has never been matched,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''No one has done it as intensively.''         In 1974 Dr. Ainsworth, who was divorced from her husband in 1960, moved to Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, where she was a professor from 1975 to 1984. She retired as professor emeritus in 1984 and remained professionally active until 1992.         She wrote several books and many academic papers, and was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford in 1966 and 1967. She also received several awards from professional organizations. Last year she was awarded the Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology from the American Psychological Foundation.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Sloan of Vancouver, British Columbia.       
         Estelle Sapir, a Holocaust survivor who won a rare recovery of the family funds she had sought for half a century from a Swiss bank, died on Tuesday at her home in Far Rockaway, Queens. She was 73.         Miss Sapir, who had been in poor health for some time, died of cardiac arrest, her niece Jeannette Bernstein said.         In 1996, Miss Sapir became the lead plaintiff in a class-action lawsuit involving thousands of Holocaust survivors who sought to recover deposits made by their families in Swiss banks.         Testifying before a Senate committee, Miss Sapir became a symbol of the movement to recover these deposits.         After years of denying Miss Sapir's claims that Credit Suisse, a major Swiss bank, was holding a fortune deposited by her father shortly before he died in a concentration camp, last year the bank joined Miss Sapir in announcing that her case had been settled.         Under the terms of a confidentiality agreement, neither party would say how much money was involved, but Swiss news organizations reported the figure to be $500,000.         Credit Suisse said the case set no precedents, but it appears to be the first instance in which a Swiss bank has not insisted that a claimant provide the death certificate of a Holocaust victim who made deposits. Such a requirement, the claimants have long argued, is impossible to satisfy, because the Nazis kept very few records of those who died in concentration camps.         The Sapir family fortune, the precise amount of which has never been determined, was deposited in several banks before the war by Miss Sapir's father, Jozef Sapir, a Jewish businessman from Poland.         Shortly before Mr. Sapir was sent to the Nazi concentration camp at Majdanek, Poland, Miss Sapir said, she was able to speak with him through barbed wire in a detention camp in Southern France.         ''You have to survive,'' she said he told her. ''You'll be O.K., because there's money in the bank.''         He then drilled her repeatedly on the names of the banks where he had spread out assets accumulated from several businesses.         After the war, during which Miss Sapir worked for the French underground, she visited a number of banks in England and France where her father had told her he had left part of his money. The bank accounts were turned over to her without question, she said.         But the Geneva branch of Credit Suisse, saw things differently.         When Miss Sapir asked to collect the money in 1946, the bank manager demanded that she provide her father's death certificate and records of his deposits.         Miss Sapir said that her father's financial records had been lost in the chaos of the war and that there was no death certificate. Credit Suisse  persisted in its demands for documentation.         Miss Sapir never gave up.         ''I felt that my father was always behind me and with me,'' she said after her lawsuit was settled last year. ''When I die and go to heaven, I will see him and say, 'I accomplished it.' ''         Recently, Credit Suisse found a record of a depositor named J. Sapir, which seemed to confirm that Miss Sapir's father had held an account at the bank.         At that point, the bank entered into serious negotiations with Miss Sapir, and she agreed to accept a payment in exchange for withdrawing from the class-action suit against the three major Swiss commercial banks -- Credit Suisse, Union Bank of Switzerland and the Swiss Bank Corporation.         In announcing the agreement, Credit Suisse suggested that it had settled the case in the absence of direct evidence of how much money Jozef Sapir might have deposited.         ''We found a sufficient basis in the facts, combined with our concern with Miss Sapir, to arrive at today's settlement,'' said Bob O'Brien, the managing director of Credit Suisse First Boston.         Miss Sapir, who was born in Poland, moved to the United States about 30 years ago, her niece said.         In addition to Ms. Bernstein, Miss Sapir is survived by two other nieces, a nephew and several great-nieces and great-nephews. She never married.       
         Michi N. Weglyn, author of an acclaimed book about the internment of Japanese-Americans in the United States during World War II, died last Sunday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 72.         She had cancer, said Si Spiegel, the executor of her estate.         Ms. Weglyn's book, ''Years of Infamy: The Untold Story of America's Concentration Camps'' (University of Washington Press, 1976), was praised by an American Ambassador to Japan, Mike Mansfield. He called it ''a conscience-wrenching book of major significance,'' and said that ''every American concerned with human liberty should know of this bleak period of our national history.''         Ms. Weglyn herself was interned in one of the camps as a teen-ager.         Frank Freidel, a professor of American history at Harvard University, wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Japanese-Americans in the western United States, numbering over 100,000, ''became the scapegoats for the attack on Pearl Harbor.''         '' 'Years of Infamy' gives an appalling view of the privation, neglect and even brutality that the bewildered Japanese-Americans underwent in the camps,'' he wrote. Ms. Weglyn's account, he said, ''based largely on Government documents, is decidedly grimmer than most earlier books on this disgraceful subject.''         In later years Ms. Weglyn worked in behalf of former internees who had not received compensation from the United States Government.         Ms. Weglyn was born in Stockton, Calif., to Tomojiro Nishiura, who was a farmer, and the former Misao Yuasa.         She attended Mount Holyoke College in 1944 and 1945 and Barnard College in 1947 and 1948.         In the 1950's and 60's, under the name Michi, Ms. Weglyn was a designer and manufacturer of theatrical costumes.         Her husband, Walter M. Weglyn, died in 1995. Surviving are a sister, Tomi Fujita, and a nephew, Walter Fujita, both of Los Angeles.       
         Sara Holmes Boutelle, an architectural historian who rediscovered Julia Morgan, one of the first female architects to achieve major success, died on Wednesday at the Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, Calif. She was 90.         Until Ms. Boutelle published ''Julia Morgan, Architect'' (1988), little was known about Morgan (1872-1957) beyond the fact that she had designed William Randolph Hearst's spectacular California castle, San Simeon.         Ms. Boutelle's biography, which traced Morgan's career from the turn of the century to the late 1950's, revealed that she designed nearly 800 buildings, a legacy rivaling that of Frank Lloyd Wright, her contemporary. Her accomplishment was remarkable also at a time when women were rarely able to enter the profession.         Helen Searing, a professor of art at Smith College who knew Ms. Boutelle, said her revelations about Julia Morgan were ''indispensable because before that she was virtually unknown to all but a handful of architectural historians.''         ''Sara Boutelle was not a feminist by today's standards and not strident at all,'' said Professor Searing, ''but she put the spotlight on women in architecture, especially on Julia Morgan.''         Ms. Boutelle, who taught art and architecture at the Brearley School in New York, became fascinated with Morgan when she visited San Simeon in 1972 and learned that its architect was a woman she had never heard of. When Ms. Boutelle retired from Brearley the next year, she moved to Northern California and began to study the building.         Ms. Boutelle discovered that Morgan had worked alone and destroyed most of her blueprints shortly before her death. She began reconstructing Morgan's designs from the scattered records of former clients. In 1988 Ms. Boutelle finally published her 271-page biography, an oversize book with photographs and drawings.         Among the buildings designed by Morgan that Ms. Boutelle was able to document were the Hearst estate, Wyntoon, in Northern California; the Asilomar Y.W.C.A. conference center in Monterey, Calif., and, in Berkeley, Calif., the Women's City Club, St. John's Presbyterian Church and the Hearst Memorial Gymnasium.         Ms. Boutelle found that Morgan also designed schools, theaters, churches, stores, hospitals, houses, apartments, a bowling alley, billard rooms, a zoo, a pet cemetery and a hay barn. She said Morgan had ''a special knack'' for swimming pools, using color, light and shape to create ''sumptuous designs that flaunted a hedonism startling for so modest an architect.''         Reviews were favorable. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Paul Goldberger said the book covered Morgan's career ''with sympathy and intelligence.'' Diana Ketcham, writing for The Nation, called it ''an exemplary work.''         Publication of the Morgan biography, which won the California Book Award Silver Medal in 1989, led Ms. Boutelle to embark on a new career as a lecturer and preservationist of historic architecture. For these activities, she was made an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects in 1991, the highest award the organization gives to someone who is not an architect.         Ms. Boutelle was educated at Mount Holyoke College, the Sorbonne and Hamburg University.         Ms. Boutelle is survived by three sons, Christopher, of Los Angeles, William, of West Chesterfield, Mass., and Jonathan of Santa Cruz; a sister, Mary Holmes of Santa Cruz, and six grandchildren.       
         Meg Greenfield, the editor of The Washington Post's editorial page, who brought a combination of sharp-eyed analysis and wry wit to bear on a generation of the nation's policy makers and politicians, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. She was 68.         She died of cancer, said The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham. The cancer had been diagnosed three years before, but not until the last six weeks did the disease sap her strength enough to silence her tart editorial voice. Her last column appeared in The Post on March 15.         Fred Hiatt, an editorial-page colleague, said yesterday, ''When it was time for her column, no matter how her body was conspiring against her, she would summon this incredible force of will and turn out a column that the rest of us would envy.''         In four decades as a reporter, editorialist and quietly influential opinion maker in the nation's capital, Miss Greenfield provided a stream of informed commentary that had an impact on the public perception of six Presidential administrations and scores of policy debates, ranging from affirmative action and abortion rights to the Panama Canal treaties and the Persian Gulf war. In 1978, when she was The Post's deputy editorial page editor, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.         In her role as the newspaper's editorial-page editor for the last 20 years and as a columnist for Newsweek magazine for 25 years, Miss Greenfield pored over the details of policy with the passion of a political scientist and wrote of the complex architecture of democracy with reverence. She also perfected a tone of sly mockery and an eye for the absurd, both of which informed the best of her work.         ''Meg has had a big influence,'' said Jodie Allen, who was lured into journalism by Miss Greenfield and is now a senior writer at U.S. News & World Report. ''She set the tone of debate early, before it became conventional wisdom. It's hard to see, because so many things she pioneered, like neoliberalism, are now in the water supply.''         Though capable of a passion for social justice, she sometimes irritated the city's progressive circles with her skepticism about any government's abilities to keep fallible citizens up to some moral mark. She also arched an editorial eyebrow at what she considered blunderbuss attacks on the conservative policies of the Reagan Administration.         A hands-on manager of both the editorial and op-ed pages of The Post, Miss Greenfield also spotted and showcased intellectual talent. Washington writers and commentators, including George Will, Michael Kinsley, Roger W. Wilkins and Charles Kraut hammer credit Miss Greenfield with starting or fast-forwarding their careers.         Her friends and confidants were legion, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board. Miss Greenfield's diminutive figure was a fixture in the elite dining rooms of Georgetown, where she lived near the home of her employer, who was also among her closest friends, Katharine Graham, the chairwoman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company, which owns both The Post and Newsweek. She was also close to Mrs. Graham's son, Donald, who is the company's current chairman and chief executive as well as The Post's publisher.         ''Meg was unique in her mind, character, and affinity for hard work,'' Mrs. Graham said in a statement yesterday. ''She was both brilliant and funny, a writer and an editor of amazing ability. She will be missed by all those affected by her original, independent thinking, by her family, her colleagues, and her close friends.''         As an editorialist, she was both a judge and a connoisseur of the foibles of the city's political and intellectual elites. ''Her mark was her obliqueness,'' Mr. Will said. ''Most columnists are Hemingway. She's Henry James, using understatement, nuance, indirection. It lasts better.''         Though missing in action from the televised punditry that began to dominate the nation's political discussion in the 1980's and 1990's, Miss Greenfield wielded her influence in many other venues, from the dinner parties of the powerful to the Columbia University offices where, from 1986 to 1995, she sat in judgment on her colleagues' work as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board.         She also had a keen sensibility for literature, history, fact and hypocrisy, and what dose of each goes into a person's reputation. That sensibility shone through one of her last columns, ''Goodbye, Columbus,'' in which she discussed the attitude of President Clinton's supporters toward Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia.         ''Senator Byrd was seen for a time as just another starchy, retrograde legislator, all hung up on the archaic lore of the Senate, ceaselessly spouting citations and precedents from the Constitution,'' she wrote. ''To be rude about it, as they were, they dismissed him as a bore.         ''But when it became apparent that his inclination and his own studies were leading him not to a love of Clinton or even to a degree of political solidarity with him, let alone any sympathy for what he did, but rather to conclusions about the Constitution that would be advantageous to Clinton, all that quickly changed. Byrd became in the Clinton supporters' depiction a great Roman statesman, a man beyond reproach -- a living, walking, breathing toga.''         Mary Ellen Greenfield -- she derived Meg from her initials -- was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Seattle, where her father, Lewis Greenfield, ran an antiques business. She graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1952, with a major in English literature, then spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Cambridge University in England, specializing in William Blake's works.         After considering an academic career, Miss Greenfield decided on journalism instead, joining The Reporter, a magazine of analysis and commentary, in 1957 as a researcher in its Washington bureau.         After three years of largely anonymous work, she published, in the heat of the 1960 Presidential campaign between Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy, a scathing intellectual profile of Mr. Nixon.         ''Refusal to answer a question by setting up a straw man to attack instead is a not uncommon device of debating,'' she wrote. ''But in Nixon's prose the straw man emerges as more than a debating device: it is an innate feature of his thinking. Nixon apparently finds it almost impossible to make a statement that is not, in some manner, an argument. Ideas never quite exist for him until they have been pitted against something else -- an extreme danger, a radically different point of view, or a potential attack from some sinister quarter.''         Miss Greenfield was promoted to staff writer at the magazine in 1961 and in 1965 became its Washington editor. When The Reporter shut down in 1968, Miss Greenfield became the first person hired by Philip Geyelin, the newly appointed editorial page editor of The Washington Post. One of Mr. Geyelin's early goals was to turn The Post away from the hawkish stance on the Vietnam War favored by its departing editorial page editor, J. Russell Wiggins.         As Mr. Geyelin and Mrs. Graham recount it, Miss Greenfield paid a courtesy call on Mr. Wiggins. Afterward, the unreconstructed cold warrior said to his dovish successor: ''My boy, you're making the mistake of your life. She's on my side.''         Few others would try to pigeonhole Miss Greenfield in the years that followed.         A year after she arrived at The Post, Mr. Geyelin made Miss Greenfield his deputy. A decade later, she replaced him. Even though she rose to the top of her profession during the years that saw the rise of the feminist movement, Miss Greenfield kept a studied distance from it.         Still, Miss Greenfield gleefully skewered some of the racism and sexism of the city's journalistic culture. In 1970, she solicited an op-ed article from Mr. Wilkins, a prominent black intellectual and policy analyst, about the Gridiron Dinner.         The piece focused on the raw humor featured at the dinner, which is an annual off-the-record event that brings the city's journalistic and political elites together for assorted high jinks. ''It was a piece that really kind of blew the town apart because people were not supposed to write about the Gridiron and I wrote about how racist that particular dinner was,'' Mr. Wilkins said.         Miss Greenfield and Mrs. Graham toured another Gridiron from the outside, trying to get a feel for the women's protests while ducking behind the dashboard of a car to avoid being seen. After the barriers fell, Miss Greenfield was a frequent guest at Gridiron dinners, attending the most recent one earlier this year.         An avid reader of literature, Miss Greenfield studied Latin in the 1970's so she could read more classic works. She was also a perennial on the college commencement circuit, receiving honorary degrees from Smith, Georgetown University, Wesleyan University, Williams College and Princeton University.         When she first became ill with lung cancer, Miss Greenfield returned to the region where she grew up and bought a home in the Puget Sound area. The property also allowed her more time to see her nephews and nieces. Her late brother's five children are her only remaining relatives.         In 1980, she wrote a mock lament to the knee-jerk excesses of her chosen profession. The piece was inspired by an embarrassing mistake at The Boston Globe that let a joke headline, ''More Mush From the Wimp,'' sneak into the newspaper over an editorial about a speech by President Jimmy Carter. After 100,000 copies were on the street, it was replaced with the headline ''All Must Share the Burden.''         ''That's the part that got us,'' Miss Greenfield wrote. ''All Must Share the Burden.'' She continued: ''Just put us in the presence of that headline and, we can't help ourselves, we start automatically and compulsively writing the editorial that goes with it. It's all about how men of good will should cease the bootless acrimony as there can be no winners in this tragic dispute and the biggest losers of all will be -- are you ready? -- well, of course, the nation's children.''         She added: ''When the end of the world finally comes about and editorial writers are all called to judgment, it won't be the headline pranks run amok, that sort of thing, that will get us. No, it will be all those other miles of editorial prose that fit so nicely under the headline ''All Must Share the Burden'' for which we will, collectively, fry.''       
         Kirsten Ralov, one of Denmark's greatest ballerinas and an authority on the unusually sparkling Danish style of classical dancing, died on Sunday at her home in Copenhagen. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, said Ebbe Mork, a dance writer in Copenhagen.         Miss Ralov was celebrated for her performances in the ballets of August Bournonville, the 19th-century Danish choreographer whose works emphasize a charming stage presence and fleet and light footwork. Associated with the Royal Danish Ballet throughout her career, Miss Ralov entered its school in 1922 and spent her artistic life from childhood to maturity on the stage of the Royal Theater in Copenhagen.         Her first major performances were in Bournonville ballets: she made her theatrical debut in a children's role in ''Konservatoriet'' in 1933 and received her first solo part as an adult dancer in ''La Ventana'' in 1941. She gave her farewell performance as the Ballerina Doll in Michel Fokine's ''Petrouchka'' in 1962. She then served as a ballet mistress for the Royal Danish Ballet and was its associate director from 1978 to 1988.         Miss Ralov's repertory in Copenhagen ranged from Myrta, the evil queen of the spirits in ''Giselle,'' to the sophisticated Street Dancer in Leonide Massine's ''Beau Danube''; she also danced a solo role in George Balanchine's abstract ''Symphony in C.'' But she was essentially a Bournonville specialist, starring in ballets like ''Napoli,'' ''The Kermesse in Bruges'' and ''A Folk Tale.''         Miss Ralov also did much to acquaint the world with Danish ballet. She and her husband, Fredbjorn Bjornsson, who died in 1993, were among the first Danish dancers to tour internationally, appearing with a small group of soloists at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in 1955 and with the full Royal Danish Ballet at the Metropolitan Opera House in 1956.         After her retirement as a performer, Miss Ralov staged Bournonville productions for many companies.         She is survived by two sons.

         Cecilia Danieli,  who helped revolutionize the world steel industry by developing the compact steel mills known in the industry as minimills, died last Thursday of cancer. She was 56.         Though women made broad strides in Italian business in her lifetime, Ms. Danieli was one of a handful who reached the top in the male domain of heavy industry. Her presence at the top, she once said, meant that Danieli consistently boasted a higher percentage of women in management posts than Italian companies of comparable size.         The company she ran, Danieli Group, founded by her grandfather in the family's hometown of Buttrio in Northern Italy, developed in the 1950's from a small manufacturer of scissors and shears to a supplier of compact steel mills to small Northern Italian steelmakers that mainly supplied the steel reinforcing bars that were the sinews of postwar Italian reconstruction.         Beginning in the 1970's, the company began shipping its engineers abroad to build mills in places like Mozambique to produce steel bars or rolling mills in the United States. These mills revolutionized steelmaking and tilted the market away from the developed world by giving scores of countries in Africa, South America and the East Asia the means to produce steel cheaply and efficiently. They ultimately led, in highly industrialized countries like the United States, to the decline of traditional big steel mills and their replacement by smaller, more flexible minimills.         Ms. Danieli, one of four sisters, was forced to take charge of the family company founded by her grandfather in 1914 in the mid-1970's, when the oil price increases in the first half of that decade drained the capital to invest in steel and scuttled further expansion. In 1976, the company posted its first loss ever. That year, she assumed the top position of managing director next to her father, Luigi, who remained president of the company but concentrated on the engineering side of the business.         She quickly rejuvenated Danieli's management, then gained a major breakthrough when the company captured a $240 million contract for a steel mill in the former East Germany from its nearest competitor, the giant Krupp group of the former West Germany. She also expanded sales in North and South America, Asia and the former Soviet Union.         In addition to its Italian headquarters, the company, with roughly 3,000 employees, had affiliates in Youngstown, Ohio, and in Sweden.         In 1984, to keep the company financially as well as technologically fit, Ms. Danieli took the unusual step for Italian family-run companies, and against the opposition of her more traditional father, of listing Danieli on the stock exchange. About 54 percent of the company remained controlled by her and Gianpietro Benedetti, her companion, with whom she shared management of the company in recent years.         Ms. Danieli entered the company in 1969 after earning a degree in economics at nearby Trieste University. A fluent English speaker, she once worked as a student for a summer on a truck farm near Schuylerville, N.Y. She avoided the limelight often favored by Italian executives. But Danieli's business success reflected her drive for technical superiority and her untiring sales efforts. A passionate student of history and a mountain climber, in the mid-1990's she once spent Christmas Day in the mountains of Iran to negotiate a sale.         She is survived by Mr. Benedetti and three children.       
         Marie St. Louis, a jazz festival talent executive who booked such artists as Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald during a 37-year career, died of cancer yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71.         Mrs. St. Louis was senior vice president of Festival Productions Inc., which promotes the JVC Jazz Festival, the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the Newport Jazz Festival and other major events. Officials of the JVC Festival, which begins in New York next week, announced that they would dedicate the event to her. She was one of the first women to achieve prominence in the jazz music industry.         Mrs. St. Louis was married briefly to Roy St. Louis in the 1950's. Survivors include her brother, Jack Barrow; her son, Marc St. Louis, a music producer, and a grandson, Cameron.       
         Anne Woolliams, a British ballet teacher who played a major role in the international success of the Stuttgart Ballet and who became artistic director of the Australian Ballet and the Vienna State Opera Ballet, died in Canterbury, England, on July 8. She was 72 and lived in Canterbury.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Jan Stripling, a former principal dancer with the Stuttgart Ballet.         Ms. Woolliams, who was trained in England and Germany as a dancer, gained her reputation as a distinguished ballet mistress and teacher during her years in Stuttgart from 1963 to 1975. John Cranko, who left the Royal Ballet in Britain to head the company in what was then West Germany, made her his assistant from the start. Soon after his arrival in Stuttgart, he and Ms. Woolliams founded the Stuttgart Ballet School, the first school in West Germany with an integrated program of ballet and academic classes.         As company teacher and ballet mistress, Ms. Woolliams taught many of the company alumni who now direct major companies, including Jiri Kylian, William Forsythe and John Neumeier. Mr. Cranko named Ms. Woolliams assistant director in 1969, the year the Stuttgart Ballet made its highly acclaimed debut in New York.         Born in Folkestone, England, on Aug. 3, 1926, Ms. Woolliams studied modern dance as a child in Germany and ballet in England with Judith Espinosa, Noreen Bush, George Goncharov and Vera Volkova. In London she danced, in 1943, with the Kyasht Ballet and then the Russian Opera and Ballet Company, the St. James Ballet and in the film ''The Red Shoes.''         After Cranko's death in 1973, Ms. Woolliams staged his ballets around the world and remained in Stuttgart  until 1976 when she was invited to become artistic director of the Australian Ballet. Ms. Woolliams returned to Europe in 1987. She served as artistic director of the Vienna State Opera Ballet from 1993 to 1995.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Wendy White-Tomson, and a brother, James, both of Kent, England.       
         Altina Schinasi Miranda, who is credited with designing the flared-frame Harlequin eyeglasses, which first came into vogue in the late 1930's and which have made kitschy comebacks from time to time, died on Thursday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 92.         Mrs. Miranda came up with the idea for the pointy glasses while working as a window display designer on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. In an optician's window nearby, she noticed the humdrum round eyeglasses for women and decided to design something different.         Her new glasses were initially rejected by the major manufacturers, but Mrs. Miranda allied herself with a stylish optical shop, Lugene, on Madison Avenue, where one of the first pairs was sold to the writer Clare Boothe Luce. Other New York trendsetters followed Mrs. Luce's lead, and by the late 1930's, Harlequin glasses were the rage.         Mrs. Miranda's glasses were hailed by magazines like Vogue and Life, and she decided to establish her own company to distribute them. In 1939 she received an American Design Award from Lord & Taylor for the Harlequins, which remained fashionable through the 1950's and enjoyed a resurgence of hip popularity in the early 1990's.         ''If you look at any 'I Love Lucy' rerun, if Lucille Ball is wearing glasses, they are Harlequin glasses,'' said David Mayhew of Maplewood, N.J., a friend of Mrs. Miranda's family.         Mrs. Miranda was born on Aug. 4, 1907, in a Manhattan mansion to Moussa and Laurette Schinasi. Mr. Schinasi, once a poor Turkish immigrant, had become a millionaire through his patented cigarette-rolling machine, which led to the establishment of a company that manufactured ''ready rolled'' cigarettes.         In the mid-1940's Mrs. Miranda sold her eyeglass interests and moved to Los Angeles. She later became a filmmaker, producing a film about George Grosz, the Weimar artist, with whom she had once studied.         In 1981 she relocated to Santa Fe  and continued work as a visual artist until her health began to decline in recent years.         She is survived by her husband, Celestino Miranda; a son, Terry Sanders of Los Angeles, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Vera Krasovskaya, the dean of Russian ballet historians and a ballet writer who was highly respected in the West, died on Sunday at her home in St. Petersburg, Russia. She was 83.         Ms. Krasovskaya came to ballet writing after a career as a dancer. She trained at the Leningrad Choreographic School, where she studied with the ballet pedagogue Agrippina Vagonova, and performed with the Kirov Ballet from 1933 to 1941. Her first writing on dance was published in 1941. She went on to study at the Leningrad Ostrovsky Institute of the Theater in 1946 and joined its faculty in 1951. She received a doctorate in art criticism in 1955.         Ms. Krasovskaya did not mince words as a critic. ''No ballet production can be fossilized,'' she wrote in a review of the recent Kirov Ballet revival of Marius Petipa's ''Sleeping Beauty'' that was reprinted in the August edition of the English journal Dancing Times in a translation by Igor Stupnikov. ''Now the company tries to revive what was created more than 100 years ago,'' Ms. Krasovskaya wrote. ''But it cannot pan out. The idea itself is wrong.''         ''Petipa wrote that any ballet, like a human being, is continually changing and developing,'' she added. ''I believe that a ballet production can preserve the delicate aroma of the past and its inherent energy but it cannot be fossilized.''         She wrote about dancers, choreographers and ballet company seasons for Soviet and foreign ballet periodicals. She was a leader in a movement in the 1950's that advocated fresh approaches to dance at a time when  some rebelled against an emphasis on drama in ballet. She developed as a ballet historian as older historians were beginning a systematic study of the Russian ballet history.         Her greatest achievements were considered to be her two four-volume histories. The first, ''Ballet Theater in Russia,'' was published in 1958 to 1972 and assessed the principles and work of Petipa, Michel Fokine and other Russian choreographers. The book provided the basis for a textbook, ''The History of Russian Ballet,'' published in 1978. Her second major history, considered her culminating work, was the four-volume ''Western European Ballet Theater,'' completed in 1996. It was the first comprehensive history of ballet outside Russia to appear in Russian since 1917.         She also wrote biographies of Anna Pavlova, Vaslav Nijinsky, Vagonova and the dancer Nikita Dolgushin. Her biography of Nijinsky, called ''Nijinsky,'' was published in the United States in 1979. It was her only book to be published in America and received mixed reviews. In 1989 she made her first and only trip to the United States, delivering scholarly papers at a Balanchine Conference in Miami and at New York University. She contributed to many major reference books on ballet. In January, she received the privately awarded Triumph Prize, given in Russia for achievement in the arts and literature. It was the first time the award has been given for work in dance.         She is survived by her husband, David Zolotnitsky; a brother, Yuri; a son, Yuri, and a stepdaughter, Tatiana Zolotnitsky, all of St. Petersburg.       
         Mignon Garland, a dancer and teacher who played a major role in keeping Isadora Duncan's legacy alive in the United States, died on Sept. 15 at her home in San Pablo, Calif. She was 91.         After Duncan's death in 1927, her repertory and ideas as a pioneer of modern dance were passed directly to Ms. Garland and other disciples by the pupils Duncan had trained in Germany and called her adopted daughters. Two of them, Anna Duncan and Irma Duncan, were Ms. Garland's teachers in New York.         She, in turn, taught many of the fourth- and fifth-generation Duncan dancers performing today, including her granddaughter, Amy Baird Garlin, and Lori Belilove, well known for her concerts in New York.         As founder and director of the Isadora Duncan Heritage Society, Miss Garland was often consulted by scholars and performers.         Miss Garland, born in Brooklyn, studied ballet and other forms of dance as a child and was 13 when she performed at Town Hall. After seeing a performance by Anna Duncan in 1927, she decided to devote her life to Duncan dancing.         In 1930, she toured internationally with the Minneapolis Symphony as a member of Irma Duncan's company. After a United States tour, the pupils of the Russian school founded by Duncan invited Ms. Garland to study and dance with them in Moscow in 1931.         After her return in 1933, Miss Garland helped found the New Duncan Dancers and was dance editor of New Theater magazine. In 1942 she formed the Contemporary Duncan Dancers with two other prominent Duncan disciples, Hortense Kooluris and Julia Levien. The group performed at Carnegie Hall in 1944 with the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leon Barzin. In 1952 the original members of Irma Duncan Dancers marked the 25th anniversary of Duncan's death with a concert at Carnegie Recital Hall.         Interest in Isadora Duncan's legend remained alive, but performances of her works became infrequent after the 1950's until Miss Garland helped promote the current Duncan revival that began with the 1977 centenary of the dance pioneer's birth.         After moving to Berkeley, Calif., in 1957, Miss Garland lived for many years in San Francisco at 501 Taylor Street, the site of Duncan's birth, which Miss Garland marked with a bronze plaque in 1973 at a ceremony attended by Irma Duncan.         In 1977, Mayor George Moscone proclaimed May 26 as Isadora Duncan Centenary Day, and Miss Garland's company, the San Francisco Duncan Dancers, performed in Colonial Concert Hall. In 1988 Miss Garland succeeded in having a street renamed Isadora Duncan Lane.         Miss Garland was also trained as an elementary school teacher at the Maxwell Training School in Brooklyn and like her parents, she was active in social and political causes. Her mother, Rose Heiman Halpern, helped Margaret Sanger open a birth control clinic in Brooklyn in 1916; her father, William Halpern, was defeated as a candidate for the New York State Assembly. Ms. Garland was denied a permanent teaching license in New York City. According to her son, Victor Garlin, the reason was ''her political organizing for improved schools in Harlem.''         After moving to California, Miss Garland taught Duncan's dancing under the auspices of the San Francisco Art Commission Neighborhood Arts Program and in private schools. She opened her own studio in 1973 and gave her last major recital with her students in 1989.         In addition to her son, of Berkeley, she is survived by a sister, Paula H. Gould of New York, and two granddaughters.       
         Linda F. Pezzano, a marketing consultant who helped what once was an obscure Canadian board game, Trivial Pursuit, achieve sales totaling more than $1 billion, died Tuesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 54.         She died of cervical cancer, said her brother David.         The Trivial Pursuit campaign designed by Ms. Pezzano changed the way game makers do business. Dorothy Crenshaw, who worked with Ms. Pezzano in marketing games and other products, said the approach was based on drumming up favorable word-of-mouth comments, or buzz.         For Trivial Pursuit, Ms. Pezzano sent 1,800 top buyers who would be attending the 1983 New York Toy Fair a series of teasing messages in the months before the event. She also sent the game to Hollywood stars whose names were mentioned in its trivia questions. When some stars, including Gregory Peck, James Mason, Pat Boone and Larry Hagman, wrote letters of thanks, she used them in her promotions.         She also staged game-playing events at parks, bars, restaurants and ski clubs to stimulate conversation.         One virtue of her campaign was that it was cheap. By giving away a few hundred games at a wholesale cost of $12 each, a fad was started.         ''She knew nobody would play a board game without getting their hands on it,'' said Chris Byrne, who in 1985 worked with Ms. Pezzano in selling the game Pictionary, a way of playing charades on paper. ''She took games to the people,'' said Mr. Byrne, who is now editor of Toy Report, an industry publication.         Mr. Byrne said her direct approach to potential players contrasted sharply with what was then the standard -- and expensive -- practice: relying on television, movies and licensing agreements.         ''She created the model that everyone now uses,'' he said. ''Today we call it 'viral marketing.' ''         Giving games away was a major part of the strategy, and she and Mr. Byrne would sometimes pass out free Pictionary games to every passenger on a flight they were on. ''We estimated that for every complete Pictionary we gave away, we sold between 5 and 12 more,'' he said.         Ms. Pezzano was born and raised in Schenectady. She came to Manhattan at 17 to become a folk singer. She attended Elmira College without obtaining an undergraduate degree but later earned a master's degree from Columbia Business School while working full time.         Besides her brother David of Schenectady, she is survived by another brother, Michael of Portland, Ore.         After a short stint with a public relations firm in the early 1980's she founded her own company, which took on Trivial Pursuit as one of its first projects. After her company was acquired by Dorf & Stanton in 1986, she moved to Italy, where she advised businesses on international ventures. In 1995, she returned to New York and started a new company, Pezzano Inc.         She continued to work on games, including a new sports trivia game called Rules of the Game. Among her ideas was to sell it in sporting goods stores rather than toy stores, where board games are traditionally sold.         ''You could go to Harvard Business School and learn how to do that,'' Mr. Byrne said, ''but to Linda it was always just common sense, and fun.''       
         Marilyn Silverstone, who left a career as a top photographer for the simple life of a Buddhist nun with the name Ngawang Chodron, died of cancer in a monastery near Katmandu last Tuesday, her sister Susan Darer said. She was 70.         She founded a nunnery several years ago near Katmandu, Nepal, one of the first Tibetan Buddhist nunneries outside of Tibet. It was a major step toward recapturing women's traditionally strong role in Tibetan Buddhism, said Gene Smith, a Boston-based publisher of Buddhist books. Ms. Silverstone worked for the photo agency Magnum -- photographing subjects from Albert Schweitzer to the coronation of the Shah of Iran -- but her last years were spent establishing the nunnery.         ''She was very interested in helping other women,'' said Jean Thies, a Buddhist living in Manhattan who has a business importing Tibetan Buddhist goods into the United States. Ms. Thies and others said this was a response to a diminished religious role for women in the Buddhist communities in exile from Tibet. Mr. Smith said, ''Women had come to be regarded as just handmaidens to the clergy.''         Ms. Silverstone's personal transformation, from a stylish photographer in Dior suits to a nun with a shaved head and running shoes dyed purple to go with her maroon robes, struck friends and colleagues as remarkable. As for herself, she saw the personal journey to her ultimate Buddhist identity, Ngawang Chodron, as essentially inevitable.         ''The only way to make my inside match my outside was to become a nun,'' she wrote.         Ms. Silverstone was born on March 9, 1929, in London, grew up in Scarsdale and graduated from Wellesley College in 1950. Her father was a movie executive who worked with Charlie Chaplin and other early movie stars; her mother, late in life, decided to get an education and graduated from college at 80.         Ms. Silverstone's first jobs were with art and design magazines, including Art News. In 1955, she became a freelance photographer. She went to India on an assignment to photograph Ravi Shankar in 1956 and fell in love with Frank Moraes, then editor of The Indian Express. They lived together until 1974, socializing in an elite set of politicians, journalists and intellectuals.         Her reputation as a photographer grew, and in 1967 she became a full member of Magnum, which is organized as a photographer-owned cooperative. She covered such big events as the arrival of the Dalai Lama in India, but it was the insights into Indian life, particularly in the villages, that she most cherished.         One famous image showed an Indian princess sitting shyly in sunglasses surrounded by 265 tigers her husband had shot. Ms. Silverstone avoided ''poverty pictures,'' calling them an Indian cliche.         Increasingly, she came to see taking pictures as predatory, once suggesting that subjects become ''like pieces of meat.'' But she readily admitted that she herself would often choose the most abject case in a line of poor children to make her journalistic point. ''You find you are getting glib with your hands,'' she said.         So she was ready to complete a journey that had begun when, as a child suffering from the mumps, she picked up ''Secret Tibet'' by Fosco Maraini. She said the book provided a key she long carried in her subconscious, the mysticism of Tibet. Mr. Moraes died in 1974 and she became a nun in 1977.         In 1987, she was fully ordained in a ceremony in Hong Kong.         Friends say she exhibited a hearty sense of humor, one laced with American Jewish expressions. She wrote several books, including several children's books published in the 1960's. In 1985, she published ''Ocean of Life: Visions of India and Himalayan Kingdoms.'' Just before her death, she finished translating a book by an 18th-century female lama into English.         Besides Ms. Darer, she is survived by another sister, Barbara S. Garrison.         Starting on Nov. 5, the work of five Magnum photojournalists, including Ms. Silverstone, will be exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. In a biography of her, one of the other photographers, Eva Arnold, quoted Ms. Silverstone summing up her life.         ''I can say that I did it all,'' Ms. Silverstone was quoted as saying. ''The secret though is just keep walking through life without analyzing it too much or clinging to it too much. Just walk on.''         Correction:  October 6, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the photographer and Buddhist nun Marilyn Silverstone on Monday misstated the given name of a photojournalist whose work, along with hers and others', will be exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh beginning Nov. 5. The photojournalist is Eve Arnold, not Eva.       
         Ella Mae Morse, the sultry, swinging pop-jazz singer whose 1942 hit, ''Cow-Cow Boogie,'' became the first million seller for the fledgling Capitol Records and helped establish the label, died on Saturday at the Western Arizona Regional Medical Center in Bullhead City. She was 75 and lived in Bullhead City.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her press agent, Alan Eichler.         A true original, Ms. Morse belted an exuberant mixture of boogie-woogie, blues, jazz, swing and country that transcended genres. Her 1946 recording of ''House of Blue Lights'' is considered influential in the evolution of rock-and-roll. Among her other hits were ''Shoo-Shoo Baby,'' ''Mister Five by Five,'' ''No Love, No  Nothin,' '' ''Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet,'' ''The Patty-Cake Man'' and her million-selling 1952 comeback hit, ''The Blacksmith Blues.''         Ms. Morse was born in 1924 in Mansfield, Tex. Her father, George Morse, a drummer from England, led a small dance band and her mother, Ann, a native Texan, played ragtime and Dixieland piano. By age 9, Ms. Morse was singing with her father's band in nightclubs. When the family moved to Paris, Tex., she befriended an elderly black guitar player who taught her the blues and became a major influence on her style.         At 13 (but claiming to be 19), Ms. Morse auditioned for Jimmy Dorsey's band in Dallas. She won the job, but had to quit when her charade was discovered. Moving to San Diego, she was reunited with Freddie Slack, Dorsey's pianist, who had quit the band to strike out on his own as a leader. He hired her to be his vocalist just as the band was signed by Johnny Mercer and Glenn Wallichs to be the first artists on their new label, Capitol Records. Their first recording, ''Cow-Cow Boogie,'' was a novelty song.         After the song leaped to the top of the pop charts, Ms. Morse was signed to Capitol as a soloist and remained there for the next 15 years. Many of her hits were even more in the rhythm-and-blues than in the pop market, and many fans didn't know whether she was black or white. (She was white.) In 1946 she reunited with Slack to record the seminal ''House of Blue Lights.''         After taking several years off to start a family, Ms. Morse returned to Capitol studios in 1952 to record ''The Blacksmith Blues.'' Although she stopped recording in 1957, she continued to make occasional appearances, including a 1970's tour with Mr. Carter's band and an annual engagement at Disneyland with Ray McKinley's band. In 1984 she made a series of club appearances in Los Angeles, and in 1987 she appeared at Michael's Pub in New York. Two years ago her complete body of work was released in a five-CD box set by Bear Family Records.         She is survived by Jack Bradford, her husband, their children, Dan and Laura, and four children from previous marriages: Richard, Marcia, Ann and Kenny, as well as eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Daisy Bates, a civil rights leader who in 1957 led the fight to admit nine black students to Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., died yesterday at a hospital there. She was 84.         In the integration struggle, rocks were thrown through her window, a burning cross was placed on her roof and the newspaper published by her and her husband, L. C. Bates, was ultimately destroyed financially. But she nurtured the nine black children who faced vicious insults and physical intimidation. She encouraged them to be courageous, while striving to guard them against howling white mobs.         The result was one of the early major victories in the civil rights movement. The desegregation of Central High School with the aid of federal troops signaled that Washington would enforce the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Brown v. Board of Education, which declared school segregation unconstitutional.         Mrs. Bates, as Arkansas president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, was a central figure in the litigation that led to the confrontation in front of Central High, as well as the snarling scenes that unfolded in front of it.         The success of the Little Rock campaign, she later said, ''had a lot to do with removing fear that people have for getting involved.''         In her forward to Mrs. Bates's 1962 book, ''The Long Shadow of Little Rock,'' Eleanor Roosevelt wrote, ''I have paid her homage in my thoughts many times and I want to tell her again how remarkable I think she was through these horrible years.''         President Clinton yesterday called her a dear friend and a heroine and said her death ''will leave a vacuum in the civil rights community, the State of Arkansas and our country.''         Daisy Bates was born in the little sawmill town of Huttig in southern Arkansas, growing up in a shotgun shack, so called because one could stand at the front door and fire a shotgun straight through the back door into the yard. She attended segregated schools that used out-of-date textbooks passed on from white schools, according to the African-American Almanac.         In her book, she told of the trauma of learning at 8 that her mother had been killed in a rape attempt by three white men. After she had heard rumors, her father told her the truth in simple and straightforward terms. ''So happy once,'' she wrote, ''now I was like a little sapling which, after a violent storm, puts out only gnarled and twisted branches.''         When she was about 15, an insurance agent came to visit her home. He was L. C. Bates, who had studied journalism and then worked for newspapers in Colorado and Kansas City. Newspapers were a shaky calling in the Depression, and he had turned to selling insurance.         After a courtship, the two married and settled in Little Rock. Together, they started a newspaper called The Arkansas State Press. It reported extensively on racially motivated violence and became known as a strong exponent of civil rights. After being elected state N.A.A.C.P. president in 1952, and as a result of the 1954 Supreme Court decision, Mrs. Bates became a particularly forceful advocate of desegregation. She began by taking black children to white schools to be registered. If the school refused, as they always did, she would report it in her paper.         In Arkansas, local and state officials initially tried to delay school desegregation, ostensibly to make the process more orderly. This resulted in a suit by the N.A.A.C.P. to force the issue. At Central High, 75 black students initially registered, a number that was ultimately reduced to 9 chosen by school authorities. They were deemed the most emotionally mature.         But Gov. Orval Faubus, responding to political urging from other Southern governors as well as polls showing that 85 percent of the state's residents opposed school desegregation, sent in the National Guard to stop blacks from attending. Governor Faubus said that ''blood would run in the streets'' if they tried. A forewarning of the escalating tension was a rock tossed through the Bateses' window. A note was tied to it, saying: ''Stone this time. Dynamite next.''         The first day of school, the black  students were turned away with bayonets at the schoolhouse door. Racial and sexual epithets were hurled at them. Mr. and Mrs. Bates were at the scene. The next day, the National Guard stepped in again.         Then President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent in the federal troops, rebuffing Governor Faubus's pleas for a one-year cooling-off period. In her book, Mrs. Bates tells of waiting for a call from the school superintendent telling her to bring the children the next day. She had told the parents that if they did not hear from her by 10 p.m. to take their phones off the hook and get some sleep. But the superintendent called after that and said that the next day, Sept. 24, the children should come to school.         Mr. and Mrs. Bates spent the next three hours visiting the parents. The next morning all the children showed up at the Bates home to be picked up by a military convoy.         ''My eyes none too dry, I saw the parents with tears of happiness in their eyes as they watched the group drive off,'' Mrs. Bates wrote.         Two years later, the Bateses'  newspaper closed as advertisements slowed to almost nothing. She served in various civil rights positions both locally and nationally and was the only woman who spoke at the March on Washington in 1963. In an interview in 1986, she said: ''I'm 75 and a half. But I'm not too tired to stand and do what I can for the cause I believe in. I would like to see before I die that blacks and whites and Christians can all get together.''         In recent years, Mrs. Bates suffered a series of strokes. ''She just wore out,'' her niece, Sharon T. Gatson, said.         She is survived by four brothers,  Leo Gatson of Strong, Ark., Kucas and Lowell Gatson of Spearville, La., and Emmitt Gatson of Detroit.         On Monday, her body will lie in state on the second-floor rotunda of the Arkansas Capitol. Just a few feet away is the office where Governor  Faubus orchestrated the 1957 confrontation.       
         Dr. Naomi Bluestone, a medical writer, a practitioner, a teacher and a ''Dear Abby'' to a generation of aspiring doctors, died Nov. 13 at her home in Center Barnstead, N.H. She was 63 and had moved there from Great Neck, N.Y., in 1991.         The cause was chronic lymphocytic leukemia, said her husband, Robert Press.         Dr. Bluestone wrote about 200 articles in professional as well as lay journals. She wrote a book, ''So You Want to Be a Doctor?'' (William Morrow, 1981), for college students contemplating medical careers and fielded the question with humor and satire.         Her main interests were in social and public health and psychiatry, and she continued to write about them to the end. Until two years ago, her general psychiatric practice in Center Barnstead drew patients from near and far.         Born in Wilmington, Del., she graduated from the University of Delaware with an English major. Changing course, she graduated from Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1962 and trained in psychiatry in New York in the 1980's.         In between, Dr. Bluestone held teaching and administrative posts in New York at Mount Sinai Hospital, Bird S. Coler Memorial Hospital and Montefiore Hospital. She was also  the city's assistant commissioner of health for chronic and long-term care in the 1970's.         She wrote on many issues confronting American medicine, particularly those affecting women as doctors and patients. Dr. Bluestone also helped organize national conferences and seminars on the challenges for female doctors and the special problems of female patients.         She wrote columns for such publications as The New Physician, Medical Dimensions and Resident and Staff Physician. As an editor she was associated with The New York State Journal of Medicine and The Journal of Community Health.         ''I was getting letters from medical students,'' Dr. Bluestone said in an interview after her book was published, ''and the medical students would pour their hearts out to me to the point where I was starting to feel like the Dear Abby of the medical profession.''         She said some asked advice about the dictatorial atmosphere of hospitals and the terror and loneliness of internship, adding, ''The women, in particular, wrote to me about sexism, discrimination, problems juggling career, home, family, husband.''       
         Gladys Yang, a British translator who spent most of her life in China, translating and promoting Chinese literature for foreign readers, died Thursday in Beijing, the official New China News Agency reported. She was 80.         ''After such famous translators from Chinese as Arthur Waley and James Legge of an earlier generation, Gladys Yang was No. 1,'' said Perry Link, a professor of modern Chinese language and literature at Princeton University.         ''She ran the gamut -- going as far back as China's classical period in the 5th century B.C., through later imperial works in the 7th through 19th centuries, and on to the moderns,'' Professor Link said.         Mrs. Yang was born in Beijing in 1919 to British parents and moved to Britain with them when she was 4. . She graduated in 1940 from St. Anne's College at Oxford University, the college's first student to receive a bachelor's degree in Chinese literature, the official newspaper China Daily reported.         She married a fellow Oxford student, Yang Xianyi, and the couple returned to China, where she taught for a while in Chongqing, China's wartime capital. After the Communist takeover in 1949, the Yangs began careers in Beijing devoted to translating Chinese literature for the Foreign Languages Press, the magazine Chinese Literature and other publishing houses.         Among Mrs. Yang's major translations was ''The Selected Stories of Lu Xun'' (Foreign Languages Press, 1960) by one of the foremost Chinese writers of the early 20th century.         Mrs. Yang's relationship to the Communist government was at times tense, although in general she and her husband occupied a privileged position.         In the mid-1950s, Mrs. Yang translated ''Keep the Red Flag Flying'' (China Youth Publishing House, 1957) by Liang Bin, a pro-Communist socialist realist novel; she expressed no reservations about the propagandistic nature of the work.         Like many foreign intellectuals living in China during the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, Mrs. Yang was persecuted and jailed. In the hope of sparing their son from the worst excesses of the period, the Yangs sent him to London. Once there, he committed suicide by burning down the house he was living in.         After the Beijing massacre of 1989, when troops moved in to suppress the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, Mrs. Yang and her husband gave a joint television interview deploring the brutality of the government's actions. But they did not leave Beijing or publicly disavow Communism. ''She clung to it the way someone holds on to a stock that falls in value,'' said Professor Link, who knew Mrs. Yang. ''She kept hoping that it would rise again.''       
         Jeraldyne Blunden, the founder and artistic director of the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, died on Monday at the Franciscan Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio. She was 58 and lived in Dayton.         The cause was renal failure, said Phyllis Brzozowska, executive director of Dayton Contemporary Dance.         In addition to guiding the small modern-dance troupe to national prominence over its 30 years of existence, Mrs. Blunden developed a number of leading American modern dance performers, among them the former Alvin Ailey star Donna Wood. Mrs. Blunden, who was awarded a MacArthur Foundation grant in 1994, was also a major and much-honored proponent of the contributions of black choreographers and performers to American modern dance.         But Mrs. Blunden had mixed feelings about that role. ''Everything in America is labeled,'' she said in a 1996 interview. ''You could call what I do black dance because I'm a black-dance person. What I do is from a black perspective. But people who are sure of themselves don't bother with that.'' That no-nonsense approach to life was mixed with steely determination, a great personal warmth and humor and an unsentimental humanity that made her a much-loved figure on the national dance scene.         Mrs. Blunden began her dance training at 8, in Dayton, her hometown, with Josephine and Hermene Schwarz , the founders of the Dayton Ballet. As a teenage student at the American Dance Festival, Mrs. Blunden had her first important experience of modern dance. ''There was Martha Graham,'' she recalled in 1996. ''Jose Limon. Merce Cunningham was the new young man on the block and we flocked to his classes, of course. My first musical concert away from home was John Cage. I thought I was in the wrong place because he played everything but the keys on the piano.'' Dayton Contemporary Dance Company would later become the first black dance troupe to acquire a Cunningham work, ''Channels/Inserts.''         Mrs. Blunden performed with several ballet and modern companies in Dayton, continuing her dancing through college, marriage and motherhood, when she began to teach. She took her students to regional ballet competitions around the country and raised money to bring them to a summer session at Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem in New York. She formed the company to give her dancers a place to perform, at first creating the repertory herself. One of her early dancers was her daughter, Debbie Blunden-Diggs. She chose her daughter along with the choreographer and dancer Kevin Ward to succeed her as artistic directors of the company.         Mrs. Blunden's honors also included the Dance Magazine Award of 1998 and the 1999 Dance USA Honors Award. In 1997, she was one of five female dance company directors honored as ''living legends'' by 651: An Arts Center.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Charles Blunden, her mother, Winifred Kilborn, and a sister, Carol Ann Shockley, all of Dayton; a son, Derek, of Charleston, W. Va., and four grandchildren.       
         Regina Shoolman Slatkin, a dealer in old master drawings and a writer and specialist on the 18th-century French painter Francois Boucher, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 92 and had homes in Manhattan, Essex, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla.         Born in what was Austria-Hungary and reared in Quebec, Mrs. Slatkin graduated from McGill University. She went to Paris on a French government fellowship to study at the Sorbonne and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and became interested in French art. She also studied at the University of Chicago.         When she returned to Canada she worked as a journalist on The Montreal Star and for the Jewish Welfare Board. She also published poetry and collaborated with the ethnologist Marius Barbeau on a government-sponsored project, later made into a book, to collect and translate the folk songs of Quebec.         In 1936 she married Charles E. Slatkin, a New York schoolteacher, and moved to Manhattan. Mr. Slatkin worked as a liaison between the public schools and the city museums from an office at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mrs. Slatkin worked as an editor and for several years as executive director of the Iranian Institute of Art and Archaeology.         In 1959 the couple opened a gallery in their apartment on East 92nd Street that specialized in old master drawings and Impressionist painting and sculpture. Their exhibitions were often accompanied by scholarly publications, like the 1962 show of Rodin's sculptures and watercolors whose catalog included essays by Leo Steinberg and Albert Elsen.         Mrs. Slatkin, who published numerous articles on Boucher in Burlington magazine and other journals, was instrumental in organizing the National Gallery of Art's 1974 exhibition of Boucher drawings, the first major show of its kind in North America, for which she wrote the catalog introduction and entries. With her husband she wrote ''The Enjoyment of Art in America'' (1947) and ''Six Centuries of French Master Drawings in America'' (1950). Her last article, ''A Note on a Boucher Drawing,'' was written and published in Master Drawings magazine in 1996.         After her husband's death in 1977 Mrs. Slatkin became interested in the decorative arts, building a collection of early-American glass that she donated to the State University of New York at Plattsburgh. She also donated 19th- and 20th-century prints.         Mrs. Slatkin is survived by two daughters, Carole Slatkin of Plattsburgh and Laura Slatkin of Chicago.       
         Charlotte Perriand, the French designer who created furniture with Le Corbusier in the 1920's and 30's and was rediscovered as a modernist legend in her own right in the 1980's and 90's, died at her home in Paris on Oct. 27. She was 96.         Through a productive career spanning eight decades, Ms. Perriand designed tubular ''equipment for living'' with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, bamboo furniture in Japan, lobbies for Air France in London and Tokyo, workers' housing in the Sahara and ski resort interiors in the French Alps.         Her ideas about flexible space, free-form shapes, natural materials and furniture designed to make ''space sing'' made her a modernist with a humanist agenda. The legs on her dining table were splayed, for example, so that people sitting at the ends could stretch their legs.         Preferring to be known as an interior architect instead of a furniture designer, Ms. Perriand subscribed to the modernist notion that furnishings and architecture needed to be developed as a single entity.         Her collaborations were often especially productive. The primary-colored bookcase with cupboards painted by Sonia Delaunay for the dormitory for Tunisian students at the Cite Universitaire in Paris and the lighting table (table and fluorescent overhead lights in one) she designed with Jean Prouve in 1953 are prized by collectors and sometimes reproduced without authorization.         ''For nearly three quarters of a century, Perriand has been one of the major innovators in French design, and her career embraces much of the history of 20th-century design in France,'' said Mary McLeod, an architectural historian at Columbia University.         Ms. Perriand was born in Paris on Oct. 24, 1903. Her early talent for drawing led her to the Ecole de l'Union Central des Arts Decoratifs. By 1926 she had been selected to exhibit her work at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs, from which the name of the Art Deco movement derives.         Her ''bar under the roof,'' an installation featuring a built-in chrome-walled bar counter and card table with pool-pocket drink holders, caused a sensation at the 1927 Salon d'Automne and established her as an avant-garde talent to watch.         Believing that she had nowhere to go but to the top, as she told Roger Aujame, a friend and former Corbusier Foundation director who is working on a catalog of her works, Ms. Perriand sought a job at Le Corbusier's studio. His initial withering response, ''We don't embroider cushions here,'' has become part of modernist lore. But once he went to see her bar installation, Le Corbusier hired her on the spot.         The years from 1927 to 1937 that she spent working with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret were formative and soon, like Corbusier, Ms. Perriand was making manifesto-style declarations about ''the new man'' and wearing her signature necklace of steel ball bearings. But it was her love of nature, especially the mountains where she often retreated, and her pragmatism that tempered the strict angularities of their furniture classics like the chaise longue and the famous cube-shaped Grand Confort chair.         In 1940 Ms. Perriand was invited to Japan, where she used traditional materials like bamboo, pine and woven straw to make modern shapes. When war broke out, she moved to Vietnam; unable to get a return visa to France, she worked for the colonial government. There she met Jacques Martin, a local official, whom she married in 1943. (An earlier, brief marriage in 1926 ended in divorce.) The couple had one daughter in 1944, Pernette Perriand, now an architect in Paris. Mr. Martin died in 1986.         Ms. Perriand returned to Paris in 1946 and was soon working on a wide range of projects, from ski resorts to student housing. Fiercely independent, she rejected frequent requests to furnish interiors designed by other architects. But she was eager to work with Mr. Prouve, the designer and manufacturer who collaborated with her and produced several of her designs from 1951 to 1953. She also collaborated again with Le Corbusier on the Unite d'Habitation housing project in Marseilles.         Ms. Perriand continued to travel to Japan and Brazil for inspiration, but spent much of her time from 1967 to 1982 working on the Arcs, a vast compound of ski resorts in the Alps.         In the 1980's the retrospectives of her work began, first at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in 1985 and then at the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Design Museum in London in 1996 and the Architectural League in Manhattan in 1997. But Ms. Perriand looked ahead, not back, and at the time of her death was exploring the possibilities of new materials for the 21st century.         At a league lecture, Ms. Perriand told the young design students there, ''We are leaving the age of oak and entering a period that will be defined by lightness, suppleness and the ephemeral.''

         Phoebe Snetsinger, who saw and recorded more birds than anybody else, died on Nov. 23 in a van accident on a birding expedition to Madagascar, shortly after viewing an exceptionally rare Helmet vanga. She was 68 and lived in Webster Groves, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis.         Birding went from a hobby to a passion for Mrs. Snetsinger on the day in 1981 that a doctor told her she had an incurable cancer, with less than a year to live. Rejecting therapy, she took off to Alaska on a scheduled trip, her first long-distance journey simply to see birds.         ''She came back and felt good,'' her husband, David, said. ''Things just started snowballing from there.''         Mrs. Snetsinger liked to say her avian ardor ''began with a death sentence,'' and her relentless energy reflected that level of urgency as her cancer went into the first of several remissions. Family members and friends could not imagine her without binoculars, floppy hat, sneakers, telescope and other field gear as she scurried around the globe on scores of bird tours, most costing more than $5,000. An inheritance paid the bills; she supplied the boundless energy. She said she spent more time in the world's jungles, mountains and other wild areas than at home.         There were setbacks, as the cancer, melanoma, recurred every five years or so, only to go into remission again. But her record, as verified by the American Birding Association, was sighting about 8,400 birds, or nearly 85 percent of the species now estimated to exist, more than 2,000 birds ahead of her nearest competitor.         ''She was a celebrity in our bunch,'' said Bret Whitney, a co-founder of Field Guides, a tour operator based in Austin, Tex. Mrs. Snetsinger was traveling on one of the group's tours when the van overturned. Mr. Whitney said she apparently died instantly.         ''She gave so much to the birding world and had so much more left to give,'' said G. Stuart Keith, the birding association's first president. At the highest tier of birding, it was a common joke to differentiate between Phoebe Snetsinger and the phoebe, a genus of flycatchers.         Genera, or large groups of species (as in the genus Homo of Homo sapiens), were of considerable importance to Mrs. Snetsinger, who kept a separate list of those that have only a single species, known as monotypic genera. Her list of more than 2,000 such genera far surpassed anyone else's, said Mr. Whitney, who also works as a research associate at Louisiana State University.         She also kept extensive notes on subspecies, using index cards as a catalog until switching in recent months to a computer from the Remington portable typewriter she had used since college.         Her subspecies notes, in whatever format, are important because many of the birds have now been reclassified as species. When she started, there were 8,500 officially named species, compared with about 10,000 now. A spokeswoman for the American Museum of Natural History said some scientists believed there could eventually be as many as 18,000 named separate bird species.         This means that her life list will almost certainly grow posthumously. ''She has birds in escrow,'' Mr. Whitney said.         Mrs. Snetsinger was born in Lake Zurich, Ill., where she attended a one-room elementary school with only two other students. At 11, she met her future husband, then 13, in 4-H clubs.         She graduated from Swarthmore College as a German major, and then taught science at the Baldwin School, a private girls school in Bryn Mawr, Pa. When Mr. Snetsinger returned from service in Korea, they both attended graduate school and she earned a master's degree in German literature.         They had four children, all of whom survive. They are Thomas, of Corvallis, Ore.; Penny, of Woodbridge, Conn.; Carol, of Missoula, Mont., and Susan, of Tempe, Ariz. All but Penny pursued careers relating to birds, Thomas as a researcher in endangered bird species for the Federal government, Carol as a bird researcher in Alaska and Montana, and Susan as a student of the spotted owl in the Northwest.         In 1965, a friend took Mrs. Snetsinger birding for the first time in Minnesota, and when her husband took a corporate job in Missouri she pursued her interest with a group of birders. (Birders adamantly spurn the term ''birdwatcher'' in the belief that it suggests a lack of gravity.) The group visited local woods and prairies each Thursday afternoon.         After birding came to represent a new lease on life to her, Mrs. Snetsinger began to take longer and longer trips. She was hooked when she visited Kenya and saw 500 different birds in three weeks. Her odyssey was aided by new technology for recording bird sounds, greater access to more and more remote habitats and the increasing numbers of tours being offered.         The depth of her enthusiasm is suggested by her response to a fall she took about six months ago while climbing a mountain in the Philippines: she stayed in the field for two additional weeks to see more birds.         The whole idea of listing birds, or at least the seriousness of the pursuit, is also sometimes criticized, or at least satirized. Indeed, it is called ''the game'' by birders themselves. ''It's like collecting stamps or baseball cards,'' said Paul J. Baicich, editor of Birding, the magazine of the American Birding Association.         Mr. Snetsinger said his wife's competitive spirit was kept hidden, though he did not deny it existed. In a 1996 interview, she insisted that she wanted to play down her quantitative quest. ''I'm going back to being a birder, not a lister,'' she said.         Ultimately, she felt very lucky, as she explained in an article to be published in next February's issue of Birding. ''Birding is the best and most exciting pursuit in the world, a glorified never-ending one,'' Mrs. Snetsinger wrote. ''And the whole experience of a foreign trip, whether you see 10 new birds or 500, is simply too good to miss.''       
         Pearl Resnick, the matriarch of a prominent New York real estate family and a philanthropist, died yesterday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.         Mrs. Resnick, whose maiden name was Ezaak, was born on Jan. 3, 1912, in Okna, Ukraine. She came to the United States with her family in 1923.         Nine years later, she married Jack Resnick, who had started a small real estate business in 1928. It grew into one of New York's largest development and construction companies, Jack Resnick & Sons. Mr. Resnick died in 1991.         Mrs. Resnick was a member of the board of overseers of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, in the Bronx.         In addition, she was also a trustee at Yeshiva and a major contributor to both institutions.         Together, the Resnicks established the Jack and Pearl Resnick Gerontology Center and the Jack and Pearl Resnick Fellowship in Geriatrics at Albert Einstein. Mrs. Resnick also endowed an academic chair in brain tumor research in memory of her daughter, Susan Resnick Fisher, who died in 1993.         In recognition of Mr. and Mrs. Resnick's support, the campus of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine was named in their honor in 1990.         Gershon Kekst, president of Kekst & Company, a New York public relations firm, said that Mrs. Resnick's character and charm were as important as her ability to raise money. Mr. Kekst, who is chairman of the Jewish Theological Seminary, recalled that about eight years ago, when the seminary was in financial straits, Mrs. Resnick joined the board and put everyone at ease. Mr. Kekst said that after a board meeting, Mrs. Resnick told him: ''That was a very good meeting. Things are going to be all right.''         Mrs. Resnick was a board member of Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. She and her husband also helped finance the Jack and Pearl Resnick Film Division of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.         She is survived by two sons, Burton P. Resnick of Rye, N.Y., and Ira Resnick of Manhattan; a daughter, Marilyn Katz of Purchase, N.Y.; a sister, Anna Sherman of Yonkers; 10 grandchildren; and 5 great-grandchildren.       
         Lucile Petry Leone, the founding director of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps, which recruited more than 100,000 young women to study nursing and helped spare the country of the need to draft nurses in World War II, died on Nov. 25 at an assisted-living center in San Francisco. She was 97.         As early as the summer of 1941, months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, there was talk in Washington that it might be necessary to conscript nurses to care for the inevitable high number of casualties there would be should the United States become engaged in a major war.         A less radical alternative -- and a much more politically acceptable one -- was temporarily agreed upon. The United States Public Health Service would start a program to attract young women at schools throughout the country into nursing. Lucile Petry, a teacher at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing, was chosen to initiate the program.         Two years later, after the United States was at war in both Europe and Asia, Ms. Leone founded and directed the Cadet Nurse Corps, a more formal effort to start women on a path to nursing. The program, authorized by Congress in 1943, offered to cover the cost of a candidate's tuition, fees, room and board, books, monthly stipends and snappy navy-style uniforms.         In exchange, said Ellen Schell, a nursing historian based in San Francisco, candidates had to ''promise to participate in essential military or civilian nursing for as long as the war lasted.''         The Cadet Nurse Corps proved a success, meeting its recruitment quotas in 1943 and 1944 and outstripping them in the final year of the war, when there were 112,000 cadets in the program. As a consequence, the United States never had to draft nurses into the armed services during the war.         Explaining the success of the Cadet Nurse Corps, Ms. Leone told an interviewer in 1945: ''We had a saleable package from the beginning. The girls immediately liked the idea of being able to combine war service with professional education for the future.''         She also gave credit to the organization's slogan, ''Custodians of the Crises of Life.''         In 1949, Ms. Leone became the first woman to direct a division of the United States Public Health Service, the Division of Nurse Education. Her rank was equivalent to that of an admiral.         ''In that capacity,'' said Zina Mirsky, assistant dean for administration at the School of Nursing of the University of California at San Francisco, ''she established the role of nursing in the federal government -- a presence that still exists.''         Ms. Leone retired from government service in 1966 and went on to teach nursing and serve as associate dean at Texas Women's University.  She retired again in 1971.         Lucile Petry, the only child of a high school principal and his wife, was born on Jan. 23, 1902, in Frog Heaven, in Preble County, Ohio. She was reared in Selbyville, Del., and  after graduating from the University of Delaware in 1924, she received  advanced degrees at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing in 1927 and Columbia Teachers College in 1929. She taught at the Yale School of Nursing and the University of Minnesota School of Nursing before being summoned to Washington.         Ms. Leone's marriage to Nicholas Leone ended in divorce in 1967. She has no immediate survivors.       
         Rose E. Bird, who became the first woman on California's Supreme Court and whose resolute opposition to the death penalty later led voters to remove her as chief justice, died of complications from breast cancer on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 63.         Almost from the moment she was appointed to head the state's highest court by Gov. Jerry Brown in 1977, Ms. Bird, a pioneering liberal lawyer who had never been a judge, became one of the most controversial figures in California politics. She led a liberal majority that strengthened environmental laws and consumer rights. But in 1986, voters angry at her opposition to the death penalty removed her and two other Brown-appointed justices by refusing to extend their terms. They were the first such removals in California history.         Ms. Bird, who came of professional age at a time when major law firms still resisted hiring women, held a succession of path-breaking jobs. She was the first woman hired by the Santa Clara County public defender's office in Northern California, and she became the first woman to hold a cabinet-level post in state government when Mr. Brown named her his secretary of agriculture in 1975. Many of her detractors were forced to acknowledge her administrative skills, while even her admirers among judges and lawyers conceded the brittleness that made her a lighting rod for criticism.         Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who had known her for years, said Ms. Bird had ''a total passion for, and commitment to, justice.''         ''In some ways, she was just too good to be a judge, he said. ''She had a total passion and commitment, and that's not always the best way to function and get along in this world, in a political environment. From the day she got to the Supreme Court, she never really had a chance.''         After the death penalty was reinstated in California in the late 1970's, Judge Bird never upheld a death sentence, voting to vacate such sentences 61 times. She survived repeated efforts to recall her, but was ousted after Governor George Deukmejian, a Republican, led an aggressive campaign against her.         To this day, Ms. Bird's name remains a kind of reflexive shorthand in California for ''soft-on-crime liberal.'' In last year's election, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, sought to tar his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by association, because Mr. Davis had been Governor Brown's chief of staff at the time of Ms. Bird's appointment.         ''I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient to see executions,'' Ms. Bird said after her removal. ''I don't think anybody in this state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that ensures nothing but executions to appease the overweening and insatiable attitude of ambitious politicians.''         Today, in part because of long-running arguments over capital punishment, California has the largest death row in the nation, with more than 500 inmates sentenced to die. But virtually the entire state political establishment, Democratic as well as Republican, now favors the death penalty, and the pace of executions is widely expected to increase.         Rose Elizabeth Bird was born on Nov. 2, 1936, in Tucson, the youngest of three children whose parents ran a chicken farm. Her parents separated in 1941, and her father died soon after. Ms. Bird's widowed mother, Anne, moved the family to New York, her home state.         Young Rose was a standout scholar in high school, earning a scholarship to Long Island University, where she majored in English in preparation for a career in journalism. She later enrolled as a graduate student in political science at the University of California at Berkeley, but an internship in the State Legislature in Sacramento persuaded her to switch to law school, because lawyers seemed to have the most influence on public policy.         After working as a public defender and teaching a seminar in criminal defense at Stanford University's law school, Ms. Bird became a volunteer in Mr. Brown's 1974 campaign for governor, serving as his frequent chauffeur on his trips to her area and later as a trusted adviser on his transition team. On taking office, Mr. Brown broke precedent by naming Ms. Bird secretary of agriculture, a post traditionally held by a grower. Ms. Bird emphasized consumer protection and worker health and safety, moving to ban the use of a short-handled hoe that forced farm laborers to spend hours stooped in the fields. She also drafted a landmark farm labor bill guaranteeing workers' rights to hold secret-ballot union elections and shepherded it through the legislature.         The controversy she generated in the agriculture post was nothing compared to the criticism that greeted her nomination as chief justice in 1977. Police groups and politicians around the state opposed her on the grounds that she would favor defendants, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, then a bishop and head of the state Agricultural Relations Board, questioned her ''emotional stability'' and her ''vindictive approach to dealing with all persons under her authority.''         Just a year later, conservatives outraged by her decisions on school busing, taxes and other issues began a campaign to remove her. Under California law, supreme court justices appointed by the governor must be approved by the electorate in the next gubernatorial election, and periodically thereafter.         She survived the opposition that year. But on the morning of election day, The Los Angeles Times published an article, citing anonymous sources, suggesting that the Supreme Court had deliberately delayed issuing a split decision overturning a law mandating prison sentences for those convicted of using a gun in certain crimes, so as not to hurt Judge Bird's chances at the polls.         That led to public hearings by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, which portrayed the court as riven by personal conflicts and political infighting. No formal charges of misconduct were brought against any justice, but the controversy generated by the investigation lingered on.         After her ouster in 1986, Ms. Bird, who never married, retreated into semi-seclusion. She cared for her aged mother in Palo Alto and surfaced occasionally as a television commentator or a public speaker, but dropped even some old friends and associates. She had battled breast cancer intermittently since 1976. Her mother died in 1991, and she is survived by two brothers, Philip, of Hawaii, and Jack, of Arizona.         ''If you have never experienced life under a microscope, you need to understand that those who live a public life are no longer seen as real persons -- human beings,'' Ms. Bird wrote in a 1996 newspaper column. ''Rather, they are objects to be examined, manipulated, ridiculed and sometimes even hated.''       
         Jeanne S. Chall, a leading expert on how children learn to read and a vociferous antagonist in at least two of the major educational controversies of the last quarter-century, died on Nov. 27 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 78.         The cause was heart failure, said Ariadne Valsamis, a spokeswoman for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where Dr. Chall taught for 26 years, until retiring in 1991.         Dr. Chall championed both challenging reading material for children and the use of phonics in basic reading instruction, as against limited-vocabulary texts and the so-called whole-language approach.         With the argument that easy is not necessarily good, she was a rigorous opponent of the prevailing view of reading specialists in the mid-1970's that if assigned reading was too difficult, children would become frustrated and give up trying to master it.         That view, Dr. Chall said, was responsible for a rash of ''cute kiddie books'' with lavish four-color illustrations, limited vocabulary and rudimentary syntax that made few demands on early readers.         Dr. Chall (pronounced shawl) attacked that orthodoxy with scores of books and articles in which she called for challenging primers.         Dr. Chall pressed her beliefs in a 1977 study that was commissioned by the College Board as part of a project to learn the reasons for a sharp decline since 1962 in average scores on the reading-comprehension part of the SAT. Although her report pointed to a number of possible explanations, it found that the scores tended to rise with the level of difficulty of the material students had been given to read from their earliest days in school.         Dr. Chall engaged in renewed combat in 1983, when, in the spring issue of Contemporary Education Review, she wrote a blistering review of a scholarly book, ''On Learning to Read'' (Knopf, 1982), by the psychologists  Bruno Bettelheim and Karen Zelan.         The Bettelheim-Zelan book, which had been almost universally praised by other professional educators, argued that the ability to decode words need not be taught but instead was intuitive, resulting without effort from the reading of imaginative, interesting stories. Accordingly, the authors said, the cure for the decline in reading scores was more entertaining and engaging primers.         Dr. Chall scorned that argument, maintaining that ''comparisons of different beginning-reading methods over the past 70 years have found that methods that teach decoding earlier and more systematically produce better word recognition as well as better reading comprehension.''         Dr. Chall also vigorously supported phonics, the method of teaching beginners to read by having them associate certain letters with the sounds those letters represent.         Many experts have de-emphasized phonics over the last two decades and instead adopted the whole-language approach, in which reading is taught through context rather than recognition of the alphabet. But Dr. Chall said her research showed that knowledge of the alphabet and familiarity with the sounds that make up words were crucial.         She expressed her view in ''Learning to Read: The Great Debate'' (Harcourt Brace, 1967), recognized as a definitive analysis of reading research.         Jeanne Stemlicht Chall was born in Poland on Jan. 1, 1921, and moved with her family to New York City when she was 7. She became the first member of her family to go to college, graduating cum laude from City College in 1941. She earned both a master's degree (1947) and a Ph.D. (1952) from Ohio State University, and taught at Ohio State, Teachers College of Columbia University and City College before joining the Harvard faculty.         Dr. Chall is survived by three sisters, Sylvia Rauch of East Brunswick, N.J., and Miriam Warmbrand and Shirley Decker, both of Rego Park, Queens, and seven nieces and nephews.
