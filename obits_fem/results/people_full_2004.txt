         Therese Thau Heyman, a curator of photographs, graphic art and drawings and an expert on American photographic history, died Friday in Berkeley, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was pneumonia, said John Cummings, associate chancellor at the University of California, Berkeley, where I. Michael Heyman, Mrs. Heyman's husband, is a former chancellor and a professor at the law school.         Over the years, Mrs. Heyman worked at the Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum of American Art and the Oakland Museum of California. She was also on the board of the Smith College Museum of Art and on staff at the Yale Art Museum, where she was a curatorial assistant.         She helped write or contributed to several books, including ''Dorothea Lang: American Photographs,'' ''On the Edge of America: California Modernist Art, 1900-1950'' and ''Picturing California: A Century of Photographic Genius.''         In her career she spread awareness and appreciation of art, particularly California's photographic art. ''You often hear people say there is no American art, but this isn't so,'' she told an interviewer in 1980, according to a statement from the office of the chancellor at Berkeley.         Mrs. Heyman was born in Manhattan and attended Smith College, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1951, and Yale, where she graduated in 1958 with a master's degree.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her son James and three grandchildren.       
         Dr. Harriet B. Braiker, a clinical psychologist and self-help author whose books touched on identity, resolving stress and the grief occasioned by the World Trade Center attacks, died on Jan. 10 at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena, Calif. She was 55.         The cause was respiratory failure after pneumonia, said her husband, Steven Fink.         One of her books, ''The Type E Woman,'' published in 1986, described the stresses of balancing a career and family. Dr. Braiker's literary agent, Alice Martel, said the ''E'' represented the woman who tried to be ''everything to everybody.'' The book was a response to research into the Type A personality so often associated with hard-driving men. It was Dr. Braiker's favorite through the years, Mr. Fink said.         In another book, ''The Disease to Please,'' she described a destructive propensity that drives people, usually women, to serve others to the detriment of their own well-being.         In the introduction to ''The September 11 Syndrome,'' published four months after the 2001 attacks, she described the premise of the book as helping readers turn ''our collective emotional adversity'' into their own psychological victories. The book prescribed steps to control feelings of helplessness and anxiety awakened by terrorism.         Dr. Kay Redfield Jamison, a professor of psychiatry at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine who met Dr. Braiker in graduate school, said she ''brought an extremely strong theoretical background to popular writing.''         ''Her books took problems that were common and subliminal and put them out in the open,'' Dr. Jamison said.         Harriet Beryl Braiker was born in Los Angeles. She graduated summa cum laude from the University of California, Los Angeles, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and won a National Science Foundation research scholarship. In 1975, she received a doctorate in clinical and social psychology from U.C.L.A.         Before establishing a private practice in 1980, Dr. Braiker worked at the RAND Corporation, analyzing health policies for the federal government. She later became a contributing editor for Working Woman and a columnist for Lear's magazine. She also appeared on television and radio talk shows and was an expert witness in legal cases on sexual harassment.         Although her earliest works examined alcoholism, depression and destructive relationships, her most recent book, ''Who's Pulling Your Strings?'' (2003), was a study of manipulation.         In addition to her husband, surviving are their daughter, Amanda Fink, also of Pasadena; a stepson, Stuart, of New York; and a brother, Dr. Barry Braiker of Beverly Hills, Calif.       
         Elma Lewis, a nationally recognized arts educator who was among the first people to be awarded a MacArthur Fellowship, died on Jan. 1 at her home in Roxbury, the Boston neighborhood. She was 82.         The cause was complications of diabetes, said Sarah-Ann Shaw, a former student.         Ms. Lewis, considered a doyenne of black culture in Boston, was a no-nonsense mentor to generations of young dance, opera and theater students at the Elma Lewis School of Fine Arts, which she founded in 1950 in a Roxbury apartment before moving it permanently to a former synagogue and school in the same area. In 1968 she founded the National Center of Afro-American Artists, which still exists although the school closed in 1986. In addition to becoming a MacArthur Fellow, she received a national medal for the arts in 1983.         She operated the Elma Lewis Playhouse in the Park, a summer theater where musicians played to capacity audiences in Franklin Park in Roxbury, after she had overseen an effort to rid the area of drug dealers and garbage. Duke Ellington and the Boston Pops Orchestra, under Arthur Fiedler, were among the performers there.         Born in Roxbury, Ms. Lewis worked her way through Emerson College by acting. She received a master's degree in education from Boston University, and staged operas and taught speech therapy, dance and drama in Boston and Cambridge, Mass.         She had no immediate survivors.         Asked in an 1981 interview in The Times if she felt like a token as one of three women among 21 MacArthur fellows, Ms. Lewis said that she had felt exclusion more because of her race than because of her sex. ''As a matter of fact,'' she said, ''women's problems belong to white women, because it is in that white dominant group that men are keeping women from utmost dominance. The black man is oppressed, and I can't imagine a man brave enough to oppress me.''       
         Fanny Blankers-Koen, a Dutch housewife who emulated her hero, Jesse Owens, and won four gold medals in track and field in one Olympics -- the only woman to do so -- died yesterday in Amsterdam. She was 85.         The International Association of Athletics Federations, which oversees track and field, announced her death on its Web site. Her daughter, Fanny, said she had had serious heart problems over the past several years, Reuters reported, and the track and field federation said she also had Alzheimer's disease.         In the 1936 Berlin Olympics, 18-year-old Francina Elsje Koen (pronounced COON) finished fifth in the women's 4x100-meter relay and sixth in the high jump. Her most memorable moment came, however, when she got the autograph of Owens, the American sprinter who won four gold medals.         The 1940 and 1944 Olympics were canceled because of World War II. In 1940, Koen married her coach, Jan Blankers, 12 years her senior, and by the time the 1948 London Olympics arrived, they were raising a son, Jan, and a daughter, Fanny.         Blankers-Koen held or shared six world records -- in the 100-meter dash, 80-meter hurdles, high jump, long jump, 4x100 relay and 4x400 relay -- but she was 30 years old. No woman in Olympic track that year was older.         At the time, elite track and field was still an amateur sport. She trained only two hours a day, twice a week, and in the winter only on Saturday afternoons. She pedaled to practice with her two children in a bicycle basket behind her. They would build sand castles in the dirt high-jump pit while she worked out.         Her track career upset people.         ''I got very many bad letters, people writing that I must stay home with my children and that I should not be allowed to run on a track with -- how do you say it? -- short trousers,'' she said in The New York Times in 1982. ''But I was a good mother. I had no time for much besides my house chores and training, and when I went shopping it was only to buy food for the family and never to buy dresses.         ''One newspaperman wrote that I was too old to run, that I should stay at home and take care of my children. When I got to London, I pointed my finger at him and I said, 'I show you.' ''         She did. In the 1948 London Olympics, the 5-foot-9, 140-pound Blankers-Koen won four of the nine track and field events for women. First came the 100 meters in 11.9 seconds. Then the 80-meter hurdles in 11.2 seconds, an Olympic record, though she had to survive a three-way photo finish and a huge scare.         For many minutes, the judges examined the finish photo. When the band struck up ''God Save the King,'' she thought it meant that an English rival had won. Instead, the music marked the arrival of King George VI, and moments later Blankers-Koen learned that she had won.         Next came the 200 meters and more painful moments. Before the semifinals, she told her husband she was nervous and wanted to quit the Olympics because of the pressure. ''Two Olympic medals is enough,'' she said.         Years later, her husband remembered in The Times: ''I had to talk much. There is only one chance in your life that you can perhaps win three gold medals, and that's the chance that you will take.''         She cried, then won the 200 final by 7 yards, the widest margin ever in an Olympics, in 24.4 seconds. Then, in the 4x100-meter relay, she took the baton for the anchor leg in fourth place, 5 yards behind the leader, and won a photo finish in 47.5 seconds.         In seven days, she ran 11 races and won them all. When she returned to Amsterdam, she was driven through crowded streets in an open carriage drawn by four white horses. The celebration almost equaled the one held when the city was liberated from German occupation.         Queen Juliana made her a knight in the Order of Orange Nassau. Neighbors gave her a bicycle so she wouldn't have to run so much.         ''I didn't know the Dutch people were so interested in track,'' she said in The Times. ''They never came to any of our meets.''         She was born on a 62-acre farm outside the Dutch village of Baarn, the only daughter of a well-off father who became a government inspector. When she started track at age 15, she was already a good swimmer. The pool director soon told her she had to choose one sport. She chose track, and by 17 she had broken her first national record.         Blankers-Koen kept running after the 1948 Olympics. She won three gold medals in the 1950 European championships and, despite painful boils on a leg, she ran the 80-meter hurdles in the 1952 Helsinki Olympics. She became dizzy from medication, tripped on a hurdle and dropped out of the race.         In 1955, she retired from track but kept in shape with running, swimming, cycling and tennis. Her husband died in 1977.         She remained a national hero. When she was 64, her son said in The Times: ''I remember when I was growing up, there were always so many people greeting my mother on the street that I was embarrassed. I'd walk five paces behind her. I don't have that feeling anymore, but I still walk five paces behind her. That's because she walks so fast. Mother still goes everywhere in a hurry.''       
         Alexandra Ripley, a writer of historical fiction who was best known for ''Scarlett,'' the officially sanctioned sequel to ''Gone With the Wind,'' died on Jan. 10 at her home in Richmond, Va. She was 70.         Her daughter, Elizabeth Lyon Ripley, told The Associated Press that death resulted from unspecified natural causes.         Ms. Ripley had written five novels before the estate of Margaret Mitchell selected her in the early 1990's to pick up the stories of Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler where Mitchell left them in 1936, the year her saga of the Civil War was published. Mitchell died in 1949.         The selection of Ms. Ripley was mired in controversy from the beginning, in part because it was less than clear that Mitchell, who refused to write a sequel herself, would have wanted anyone else to try.         Ms. Ripley made no bones about why she wanted the assignment.         ''There are two reasons why I'm doing this book,'' she said in an interview in the reference work Contemporary Authors. ''I can't resist it, and as soon as this is done I will be able to write anything I want to.''         ''Scarlett,'' which was universally panned by critics, was a considerable commercial success.         In her review for The New York Times in September 1991, Janet Maslin characterized the book as a ''stunningly uneventful 823-page holding action.''         The Ripley version takes the story from Atlanta to Tara to Charleston to Savannah to Ireland, where Scarlett remarks, ''My stars, this country's positively peppered with castles.''         It engineers at least a temporary reconciliation with Rhett, with Scarlett even cooking breakfast for him, but such touches led many reviewers to say the characters seemed to have mellowed in ways never suggested by the original book.         After a bidding war, Warner Books won the rights to publish the novel for $4.94 million.         Despite the poor reviews, ''Scarlett'' catapulted to the top of the best-seller list.         Over the years, sales have remained steady, according to Warner Books, with millions of copies in print in both hardcover and paperback.         CBS bought the television rights to ''Scarlett,'' which was presented as an eight-hour mini-series in 1994.         ''Thanks to Miss Mitchell and 'Scarlett,' right now I can say any damn thing I want to, and people will listen,'' Ms. Ripley told those attending the 1991 Southeastern Booksellers Association convention.         Alexandra Ripley was born Jan. 8, 1934, in Charleston, S.C., the only child of Alexander and Elizabeth Braid. She attended the Ashley Hall School in Charleston and graduated from Vassar College in 1955, majoring in Russian.         Although she had always aspired to be a writer, Ms. Ripley did not work up the courage to become a novelist until she had tried a number of other jobs, including manuscript reader and publicity director.         Her first novel, ''Who's That Lady in the President's Bed?,'' was published by Dodd/Mead in 1972 under the pseudonym B. K. Ripley.         After the publication of ''Scarlett,'' Ms. Ripley wrote other novels that drew better reviews, including ''From Fields of Gold,'' published by Warner Books in 1994, and ''A Love Divine,'' a novel about Joseph of Arimathea, published by Warner Books in 1996.         Ms. Ripley was legally separated from John Graham of Charlottesville, Va. She is survived by her daughter Elizabeth, another daughter, Merrill Ripley Geier, and a granddaughter, all of Richmond.       
         Janet Frame, whose vividly romantic explorations of madness and language in novels, poetry and autobiography propelled her to worldwide attention, died yesterday in Dunedin, New Zealand. She was 79.         Dunedin Hospital said the cause was acute leukemia, The Associated Press reported.         In 1973 she legally changed her surname to Clutha, after the river south of Oamaru, her childhood home, but continued to write under the name Janet Frame.         Ms. Frame's work used her own disturbing life to weave fictional nightmares that reflected, in her words, the ''homelessness of self.'' After a suicide attempt she spent eight years in mental hospitals in New Zealand, receiving 200 electroshock treatments. She was about to have a lobotomy when a hospital official read that she had won a literary prize. She was released.         Later, a panel of psychiatrists determined that she had never had schizophrenia. In the sort of bitterly perceptive, highly personalized twist that infuses much of her writing, that news did not please her.         ''Oh why had they robbed me of my schizophrenia, which had been the answer to all my misgivings about myself?'' she wrote in the third volume of her autobiography, which, with the first two, was dramatized in Jane Campion's 1990 film ''An Angel at My Table.''         ''Like King Lear I had gone in search of 'the truth' and now I had nothing,'' she continued.         Ms. Frame's 12 novels, four story collections, one poetry collection and three volumes of autobiography won dozens of awards.         ''As the body of her work has enlarged, one comes to understand it not just as a series of extraordinary insights into suffering and thought, but as a mighty exploration of human consciousness and its context in the natural world,'' the American Academy of Arts and Letters citation read when she was made an honorary foreign member in 1986.         In her novel ''The Edge of the Alphabet'' (Braziller, 1965) words literally crumble into meaninglessness and communication becomes useless. Even spelling becomes sinister. In ''Intensive Care'' (Braziller, 1970) she spells history hiss-tree to make an unsettling connection to Eden's serpent. ''All dreams,'' she wrote, ''lead back to the nightmare garden.''         Ms. Frame created romantic visionaries -- eccentrics, mad people, epileptics -- and pitted them against the repressive forces of a sterile, conformist society. Or maybe she was just reporting on her life. A continuing discussion among critics was whether her autobiographical work was mostly fiction or whether her fiction was mostly autobiographical.         Janet Paterson Frame was born on Aug. 28, 1924, in Dunedin. Her father was a railroad engineer. Her mother, who once worked as a maid in the home of the New Zealand writer Katherine Mansfield, wrote poems that she sold door to door.         Janet's youth was blighted by the drownings of two sisters. She attended the local teachers' training college, where she felt so lonely that she found peace sitting among tombstones in a cemetery. While practice teaching, she panicked when an inspector entered the classroom, and she fled, never to return. She suffered a breakdown that was misdiagnosed as schizophrenia.         After her eight years in two psychiatric hospitals, she was befriended on her release by Frank Sargeson, a writer, who let her stay in an army hut in his backyard in Auckland, New Zealand. She wrote her first novel, ''Owls Do Cry'' (Pegasus, 1957), while staying there. The narrator was Daphne, a patient in a mental hospital.         She next traveled abroad on a grant from the New Zealand government, and in London a panel of psychiatrists determined she was not mentally ill, just different from other people. While living in Europe she published five novels from 1961 to 1963.         Ms. Frame is survived by her sister, June Gordon.         She returned to New Zealand in 1964 and wrote more novels, and three volumes of autobiography (Braziller, 1982, 1984, 1985). Despite the deep introspection of her writing, she developed a reputation as a private person.         In the early 1990's she had two mild strokes, which affected her mental stamina and power of concentration, but she continued to write.         ''Writing is a boon, analgesic, and so on,'' she said. ''I think it's all that matters to me. I dread emerging from it each day.''         Correction:  February 20, 2004, Friday  An obituary of the New Zealand novelist Janet Frame on Jan. 30 omitted attribution for a sentence describing the characters in her work: ''Ms. Frame created romantic visionaries -- eccentrics, mad people, epileptics -- and pitted them against the repressive forces of a sterile, conformist society.'' It was derived from the Oxford Companion to New Zealand Literature (Oxford University Press), as reprinted on the New Zealand Book Council's web site, www.bookcouncil.org.nz.       
         Fraydele Oysher, a star of the Yiddish theater and a member of a musical dynasty, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan, said her daughter, the singer and comedian Marilyn Michaels. She was 90.         The daughter of a cantor, Ms. Oysher began her career as a child actress in the Yiddish theaters that once dotted Second Avenue on the Lower East Side. She starred in musicals written for her, including ''The Little Queen,'' ''The Golden Girl'' and ''Fraydele's Wedding.''         She also specialized in one of the Yiddish theater's staple roles: the Yeshiva boy who -- it is revealed in the final, showstopping number -- is really a girl.         ''I was cute, I was flat and I was a terrific piece of work,'' she explained in a 1996 interview with The Daily News.         As an adult, she became one of the first women to sing cantorial music onstage, long before women were allowed to assume that role in Reform and Conservative synagogues. She also toured the United States, South America and Cuba, performing folk songs, theater songs and liturgical chants with her husband, Harold Sternberg.         Mr. Sternberg, who appeared on Broadway in a number of George Gershwin's shows, was also a basso profundo in the Metropolitan Opera chorus for 40 years.         Ms. Oysher's brother, Moishe, was a major star in Yiddish theater and films and a cantor known as ''the master singer of his people.''         Fraydele Oysher was born on Oct. 3, 1913, in Lipkon, Bessarabia, which was then a Russian province. (It is now part of Moldova.)         In addition to Ms. Michaels, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Oysher is survived by her son, Michael Sternberg, also of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Georgette Klinger, who 60 years ago mixed a secret ingredient or two with common sense and created a recipe for clear skin -- and a chain of centers to pamper it -- died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan, said her daughter, Kathryn Klinger Belton. She was 88.         Miss Klinger, whose own complexion was a pampered milky white, began by treating the skin as a tender, living organ, not a surface in need of decoration, an approach that revolutionized cosmetic skin care. Her techniques for doing facials set the standard, as did her early use of herbal treatments, nutrition and exercise as part of skin care.         Before Miss Klinger, beauty treatment involved getting one's hair or makeup done, her daughter said. The new techniques Miss Klinger brought from Europe and further developed herself to revitalize skin helped lay the foundation for today's multibillion-dollar spa industry, and she widened the universe of those who enjoyed facials, devising treatments for men and teenagers.         She opened her Madison Avenue salon in 1941, and eventually had nine salons around the country. They quickly attracted socialites, movie stars and, later, movers and shakers like Helen Gurley Brown and Hillary Rodham Clinton.         In 1972, The New Yorker said that Miss Klinger was ''more than an imperious name scrawled in gilt across the white containers filled with her cosmetics and unguents.'' What separated her from the pack, the magazine suggested, was ''an affection for women and a concern for their faces that -- in a field set close with jostling prima donnas, despots, social arbiters and frauds -- are clearly genuine.''         Miss Klinger's own image was almost never without a hat, and she greatly preferred uncomfortable shoes to unfashionable ones. Her beloved poodle, Pushka, traveled in a Louis Vuitton case and lunched with her at the Carlyle Hotel.         She eschewed most advertising, in part because she disliked big words, and regarded washing one's face as perhaps the most important beauty treatment. ''I offer no miracles, no promises -- just clean skin,'' she said in an interview in 1976.         Georgette Eckstein was born in Brno, in what became Czechoslovakia. As a young woman she won a beauty contest and was given some cosmetics that irritated her skin. When dermatology treatments proved unsuccessful in curing her acne, she began experimenting with her own cures. She trained with dermatologists and cosmeticians in Zurich, Budapest and Vienna, as well as in Prague.         She opened her first salon in Czechoslovakia in 1938, but was forced to close it a year later when Hitler took over the country and she and her three brothers fled to London, her daughter said. Her parents stayed and vanished; she never learned what happened to them.         Miss Klinger got a bank loan to open her shop at 509 Madison Avenue. (She later moved to 501 Madison and outfitted the new shop with a swirling stairway of chrome and glass.) In the early years, she made all her products in her kitchen.         ''I was very lucky because I got some very famous people who had acne,'' Miss Klinger said in an interview with WWD in 1992. ''Actresses used to fly from Hollywood to see us.''         Step by patient step, she opened new salons, and in 1982 set up a separate laboratory and factory in New Jersey, which allowed her to expand the Georgette Klinger brand. Her company's revenues exceeded $20 million in 1988, when it was sold to the Pyle Group, a financial services and investment firm.         Miss Klinger's husband, Jacobo Klinger, died in 1976. In addition to her daughter, of Los Angeles, she is survived by two grandsons.         ''If I see someone leaving the salon who doesn't look their best, I say so, right in front of the employee,'' she said in an interview with The Washington Times in 1992. ''I tell them to redo her.         ''It's not very nice, I guess, but it has to be done.''       
         Uta Hagen, the formidable and wide-ranging stage actress who electrified audiences with her Tony Award-winning performance as the ferocious, tart-tongued Martha in the original Broadway production of Edward Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' in 1962, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan, her daughter, Leticia Ferrer, said. She was 84.         Over seven decades, Ms. Hagen acted in Shakespeare, Chekhov and Shaw, as well as in plays by Mr. Albee and Tennessee Williams. With her husband Herbert Berghof (who died in 1990), she ran the HB Studios in Manhattan and was celebrated not only as an actress but also as a teacher of acting and author of books on the subject. She continued to teach after a stroke and until several months before her death. Occasionally she appeared in films and on television, but principally her life was onstage, and it was there that she was able to incarnate the widest diversity of characters.         Ms. Hagen made her professional debut in 1937 playing Ophelia to Eva Le Gallienne's Hamlet, and was acclaimed for her Nina (in ''The Seagull''), Desdemona (opposite Paul Robeson's Othello), Shaw's St. Joan, Blanche DuBois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and as the title character in ''The Country Girl'' by Clifford Odets. Mr. Albee's Martha became her signature role.         It was a long journey from Ophelia to Martha, but one that she traveled with an unmatchable authority and an intuitive sense of character. Whether she was playing a saint or a termagant, she anchored each role with a firm base in reality. Despite her onstage strength, she said she always considered herself ''a vulnerable actress.'' Once asked what qualities an actress needed to play Martha, Ms. Hagen said, ''Intelligence, voluptuousness and hypersensitivity,'' and then added, ''wit'' -- all of which she had in abundance.         In a recent interview, Mr. Albee recalled her ''extraordinary performances as Desdemona in 'Othello' and Martha in 'Virginia Woolf,' '' and praised Ms. Hagen first as ''a profoundly truthful actress'' and then as ''a dedicated and demanding teacher.''         ''I should add,'' he said, ''she was a great anti-hypocrite, and a superb cook -- not a bad friend to have.''         In 1999, she called her whole goal as an actress ''the spontaneity that comes without planning.'' Whenever possible, she uncovered the drama behind the comedy -- or the comedy behind the drama. As she said, ''Somebody with wit and a sense of humor sees the most tragic event without the sentimentality, sees in any life experience something ludicrous -- which is probably why Chekhov is my favorite.''         She believed a performance should change in the course of the run, depending on the identity of the other actors, the audience response and the actress's mood and temperament. She played Blanche opposite Marlon Brando, Anthony Quinn (her favorite), Ralph Meeker, Richard Kiley and Jack Palance. ''If you go on with another actor and your performance doesn't change, you're a bad actor.''         In contrast to many other actors, she loved long runs: ''After a couple of months,'' she said, ''it really starts to get in my bones.'' On keeping a part alive, she called Laurette Taylor her guide. She saw her play Amanda in ''The Glass Menagerie'' 10 times, saying, ''Ten different exciting performances -- to me, that is the magic of the theater.''         Uta Hagen was born in Göttingen, Germany, on June 12, 1919. Her father named her after a 13th-century statue he saw in a Nuremburg cathedral. When Uta was 7, the family moved to Madison, Wis., where her father was head of the department of art history at the University of Wisconsin (her mother was an opera singer). From the age of 6, when she saw Elisabeth Bergner play Shaw's ''St. Joan'' in Berlin, she wanted to be an actress. She studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London, and at the University of Wisconsin, and left college -- and left home -- to pursue an acting career.         In 1937, Le Gallienne was preparing to play Hamlet in a production in Dennis, Mass., and was having difficulty finding an Ophelia. Ms. Hagen sent a letter requesting an audition. As Le Gallienne recalled in her autobiography, her impulse was to refuse, but something in the letter encouraged her to invite the young actress to audition.         ''She was very young -- only just 17 -- a tall, rather gawky creature, by no means pretty, but with a face that one remembered,'' Le Gallienne wrote, adding she had ''the shy ungainly grace of a young colt.'' For her audition, Ms. Hagen acted the end of the trial scene from ''St. Joan,'' ''quite badly,'' Le Gallienne said, ''and yet I sensed in her an inner truth that very occasionally filtered through in a word or a look.'' She told her to go and think about the role and return in an hour.         ''The improvement was startling,'' Le Gallienne said, ''The truth that had glimmered so faintly in the first reading now blazed up strongly, and the overall effect was strangely moving.'' She cast her.         In the dress rehearsal, she said, ''the sacred fire struck, and the child Uta was transported to a region which I well knew she would not set foot in again for many years to come.'' And so, just 18, Ms. Hagen made her professional debut as Ophelia, an Ophelia that was several inches taller than Hamlet.         She then joined Le Gallienne's theater company, which was preparing a production of ''The Seagull.'' The director was playing the role of Nina, with Ms. Hagen as her understudy. That production never came to fruition, but soon Ms. Hagen heard that Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne were about to do it on Broadway.         At the audition, Lunt told her to do something simple, not classical and nothing from ''The Seagull.'' She had planned to do the last scene from ''A Doll's House,'' but at the last minute decided to do Nina anyway. ''I played the whole last scene as Nina alone, without a Konstantin present,'' she recalled, ''and I came offstage in a daze.'' As she headed out the stage door, she was called back, and Lunt (who was playing Trigorin) rehearsed with her long into the night, and then told her she had the part. Ms. Hagen's Broadway debut came the next year as Nina in Lunt and Fontanne's ''Seagull.'' In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson singled her out for praise as ''grace and aspiration incarnate.''         That summer, working in Ridgefield, Conn., she acted in ''The Latitude of Love,'' opposite José Ferrer. In the course of the play, she was required to knock him down. Several months later they were married. During their 10-year marriage, they appeared together in several plays, including ''Angel Street.''         Ms. Hagen is survived by their daughter, Leticia, known as Lettie, of New York City; a granddaughter; and a great-granddaughter.         Ms. Hagen said she considered the period between 1938 and 1947 as ''the transitional years of my career, during which I lost my way and a love of acting until I finally regained it to begin a true life in the theater.'' During that time, she acted in seven Broadway plays, including ''Key Largo'' (with Paul Muni) and ''Othello'' (with Robeson as Othello and Ferrer as Iago). The turning point, she said, was in 1947 when Harold Clurman directed her in ''The Whole World Over.'' The play was forgettable, but she greatly admired Clurman as a director and teacher, and it was in that play that she met Berghof, who replaced another actor in the company.         Having divorced Ferrer, she married Berghof and the two dedicated themselves to teaching actors in their HB Studio, on Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In subsequent years, teaching young actors became as important to her as her own acting. In one of her books, ''A Challenge for the Actor,'' she disagreed with Shaw's pronouncement ''He who can does. He who cannot teaches.'' For her, ''Only he who can should teach.''         In 1948, she led the national company of ''A Streetcar Named Desire'' and then followed Jessica Tandy in the role on Broadway. In 1950 she played the title role in ''The Country Girl.'' For that performance, she won her first Tony.         The next year, she finally played St. Joan, in Margaret Webster's production. Always outspoken about politics and human rights, Ms. Hagen was blacklisted in the 1950's, and, she said, ''that fact kept me pure.'' Unable to work in the movies or on television or to tour plays through the United States, she continued to focus her attentions on New York theater. She was a member of the Phoenix Theater, but her acting became more sporadic.         Then, in 1962, the call came to return to the stage. The producer Richard Barr and his partners were bringing a new play by a new playwright to Broadway, ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' by Edward Albee, and they were searching for an actress to play the central role. Ms. Hagen read the play between classes and it so gripped her that she taught her final class, she said, ''in a daze.'' Immediately she agreed to do it, and when she met the playwright she told him the play was ''like a great modern Bosch canvas.''         In the play a faculty couple, George and Martha (Arthur Hill and Ms. Hagen) engage in a long night of mutual abuse -- and revelation. Ms. Hagen's performance galvanized the play. ''Virginia Woolf'' was a turning point for the actress and for Mr. Albee. The play received five Tonys, including awards for both Ms. Hagen and Mr. Hill. In 1964, they both did the play in London.         In the years that followed, Ms. Hagen occasionally ventured back into theater. In 1968, she played Mme. Ranevskaya in Le Gallienne's A.P.A. ''Cherry Orchard.'' Later she did Peter Hacks's ''Charlotte'' (in which she played Goethe's mistress), Shaw's ''You Never Can Tell'' and ''Mrs. Warren's Profession,'' Nicholas Wright's ''Mrs. Klein'' and, in 1998, Donald Margulies's ''Collected Stories.''         After playing Martha on Broadway and London and making a recording with the original cast, she did not return to the role -- until 1999.         In a single performance for the benefit of the HB Playwrights Foundation, she played Martha once more in a staged reading on Broadway. Jonathan Pryce played George and Matthew Broderick and Mia Farrow were the couple's two guests.         At 80, she was aware of the pitfalls. ''It's a terrible risk for me,'' she said. ''I'm 28 years too old for the part. I was 42 when I played it. Martha's supposed to be 52. People have such incredible memories of my performance. I don't see how anybody could possibly live up to it, certainly not me, almost 40 years later.''         But once she came onstage, and said Martha's first line: ''Jesus H. Christ,'' followed by her imitation of Bette Davis saying ''What a dump,'' and as she pitched into verbal battle with her husband, the intervening years passed in a cloud.         Correction:  January 29, 2004, Thursday  An obituary of the Broadway actress and drama teacher Uta Hagen on Jan. 15 misidentified the German city where the cathedral is the site of a statue for which she was named. It is Naumburg, not Nuremberg.       
         MARIE C. WILSON, the president of the Ms. Foundation for Women, has the comportment of a seasoned politician. One of the sharper ones. She speaks with passion and laser-beam focus in a soft Georgia accent. Perhaps this impression is enhanced by that snappy red blazer, so bold and camera ready. Maybe it's the good political hair. It stays in place.         In this election year, does she wish she were out there? ''No,'' she says in a quick breath, eager to steer the chat back to her campaign with the White House Project, a nonpartisan group focused on getting women into leadership roles, up to the presidency. Besides, Ms. Wilson, who is 63, has been there, done that. Twenty years ago, she left a seat on the Des Moines City Council, where she got encouragement to run for governor, to lead the Ms. Foundation, which finances hundreds of programs to advance the rights of women and girls.         This brings us to the subject of the white bowler, emblazoned with ''Madame President'' in red, white and blue, propped on Ms. Wilson's computer in her comfortable office on Wall Street. What's with the hat?         Ms. Wilson is convinced that it won't be long before a woman is in the Oval Office. Perhaps in this decade. She thinks this even with nary a woman among the current pack since the withdrawal of Carol Moseley Braun, whom she praises highly.         She rubs her slender hands together fiercely, as if kindling fire. ''This is our time,'' she says. ''I think by 2008, we're going to see several women in the race.'' As president of the five-year-old White House Project, she hopes to recruit and train 1,000 women to become political leaders, and to enlist 25,000 women to get out the vote this year. She hopes to find these women by teaming with sister groups across the country. (She has contacts!)         So getting back to the presidency, who can we expect four years from now? Hillary Rodham Clinton? ''The common thinking is about Hillary Clinton, but there are other women, great women governors out there,'' says Ms. Wilson, a Democrat. She mentions two Democrats, Gov. Janet Napolitano of Arizona and Gov. Kathleen Sebelius of Kansas, and a Republican senator, Kay Bailey Hutchison from Texas.         ''I think we will see two or three women running,'' she continues. ''And that's the point, to get enough women running so they are seen and they're evaluated on their agenda, not just gender, because numbers matter. One woman is always hair, hemline and husband. She has to prove she is man enough for the job.''         One might be tempted to say good luck.         Yet in 1993, people didn't take Ms. Wilson seriously when she had this notion to get parents to take their daughters to their workplaces to focus attention on their potential, not on their problems. Take Our Daughters to Work Day now has the participation of about 15 million adults annually.         ''People would tell us, 'I've always trusted you, but that's the nuttiest thing I've heard,''' she says.         Let's just say, in women Ms. Wilson trusts. She goes into this more in her book, ''Closing the Leadership Gap: Why Women Can and Must Help Run the World,'' due out next month from Viking Press. It is a call to action.         ''Think about what is going on in the country: terrorism, corporate greed,'' she says. ''These are things people are so concerned about that they are glued on the election. And what's an intervention that might have the most positive outcomes? It is bringing in a critical mass of women, a diversity of women, so you get some really different perspectives at the table so we can have different solutions.''         When Ms. Wilson arrived at the Ms. Foundation, there were four staff members and a $500,000 annual budget. The foundation now has a budget of $11 million and 40 employees. One is a man, a receptionist.         SHE describes her life as that of an ordinary American woman. Raised in segregated Atlanta, the daughter of a typesetter and a dental hygienist, she was high school homecoming queen and a cheerleader. She became immersed in civil rights after studying philosophy at Vanderbilt University. Her passion was stoked by a childhood incident in which a white bus driver dragged her crying from the back of the bus where she sat with her black baby sitter.         She married a man who became a minister of music, and followed him to churches in Delaware, Pennsylvania and Iowa, where she developed women's programs at Drake University. Later, she became an educator and human resources director for the Iowa Bankers Association. Her family grew to five children. She divorced. She came to New York to lead the Ms. Foundation.         ''I ended up loving a woman,'' she says simply. ''My relationship is wonderful.''         Her partner of 15 years is Nancy A. Lee, a vice president for business development at The New York Times, and they live in Manhattan.         One senses she would rather keep her private life private. The conversation turns to topics of the day. Same-sex marriage? ''The most important thing is really having the rights,'' she says. ''It's not about the marriage. It's having the same rights that you would get if you were married.''         She is asked if she thinks the foundation, created in 1972, is as relevant today as it was then. Of this, she has no doubt. ''Whether you look at the glass ceiling or the sticky floor, we're still there,'' she says. ''We've stayed in the game.''         PUBLIC LIVES  Correction:  February 19, 2004, Thursday  A Public Lives profile on Tuesday about Marie C. Wilson, president of the White House Project, which is trying to involve more women in leadership roles, misstated the type of hat, emblazoned with ''Madame President,'' that sits atop Ms. Wilson's computer. As the picture showed, it is a boater, with a flat crown and brim, not a bowler, which would have a round crown and curved brim.       
         Estelle Stewart Axton, whose name put the ''Ax'' in Stax Records, the Memphis soul label she founded with her brother, died on Tuesday in Memphis. She was 85.         She died at the St. Francis Nursing Home after a series of strokes, said Deanie Parker, the president and chief executive of Soulsville, the nonprofit corporation that runs the Stax Museum of American Soul Music and the Stax Music Academy.         In the heyday of 1960's and 70's soul, Stax released hits by Otis Redding, Sam and Dave, Wilson Pickett, Isaac Hayes, Rufus Thomas and the Staple Singers, among many others. It was the second-best-selling soul label of its era, behind Motown Records.         The Stax studio, in the former Capitol movie theater in Memphis, attracted young singers and songwriters, and was an integrated business in a largely segregated city. Ms. Axton and her brother, James Stewart, founders of the label, were white; most of their hitmakers were black; and the label's studio band, Booker T. and the MG's, was mixed. ''We never looked at color; we looked at people,'' Ms. Axton said last year.         Stax got started as Satellite Records in 1957, when Mr. Stewart, a country fiddler who worked at a bank, began recording country songs in his wife's uncle's garage, but soon switched to rhythm-and-blues. His eldest sister, Estelle Stewart, who had married Everett Axton in 1941, became Mr. Stewart's partner in 1958 when she took out a second mortgage on her home to buy recording equipment. In 1960 they leased the abandoned theater, in a mixed neighborhood that was fast becoming an African-American ghetto, and made it the company's offices and recording studio.         To generate income they installed a record store at the theater's old candy counter. The shop, Satellite Records, drew teenagers and became a place to recruit talent and a test market for their new releases. The first singers to record at the studio were Rufus Thomas and Carla Thomas, father and daughter, and their rhythm-and-blues song ''Cause I Love You'' became the label's first regional hit, followed by Carla Thomas's ''Gee Whiz.''         The label's third hit, ''Last Night,'' was an instrumental by the Mar-Keys, a group including Ms. Axton's son, Charles (nicknamed Packy) Axton, on saxophone. After ''Last Night'' was released, a Satellite Records label in California noticed the company. Mr. Stewart and Ms. Axton changed their label's name to Stax, from the first letters of Mr. Stewart and Ms. Axton's last names.         The label began regularly releasing hits through the 1960's. Musicians called Ms. Axton Lady A., and in Rob Bowman's ''Soulsville U.S.A.: The Story of Stax Records'' (Schirmer Trade Books, 1997), the guitarist and songwriter Steve Cropper describes her as ''the heart and soul of that whole place.''         She nurtured songwriters, ran the record store and helped decide what Stax released, including, over her brother's initial opposition, Eddie Floyd's ''Knock on Wood.''         Although Stax was a musical powerhouse, it was a business debacle. After bad deals with major labels, the company went bankrupt in 1975. By then Ms. Axton was no longer with the company. In 1969, after disagreement about the label's direction, she quietly left the company in 1969, bought out by her brother and the label's president, Al Bell.         Part of her settlement included $25,000 a year on the condition that she stay out of the recording business. Her son Charles became the head of Fretone Records, and in 1974 Ms. Axton took over. That label's big hit, in 1976, was the Rick Dees novelty song ''Disco Duck.''         Ms. Axton is survived by her sister, Mary Lucille McAlpin; her brother, Mr. Stewart; her daughter, Doris Axton Fredrick; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Stax's headquarters was demolished in 1989, but last year a new building on the site, complete with a reproduction of the studio and a new Satellite Record Shop, opened as the Stax Museum of American Soul Music and the Stax Music Academy.       
         Amy M. Spindler, the former fashion critic of The New York Times and style editor of its magazine, whose knowledge and fierce opinions held the world's leading designers to task and helped to raise the standard of fashion writing, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 40.         The cause was a brain tumor, said her husband, Roberto Benabib.         Ms. Spindler was never interested in simply putting a dress on a page or talking about hemlines. She recognized that fashion was as important a cultural barometer as music or art and that it should be -- demanded to be -- covered as rigorously as a political campaign.         In an industry more accustomed to flattery and sympathetic reviews, she possessed a rare nerve, upbraiding fashion executives when she thought they were dissembling and beseeching designers to be better than they were.         ''She explained to us how we really feel about fashion,'' Tom Ford, the creative director of Gucci, said yesterday from Los Angeles. ''She saw the relevance of fashion for intelligent people -- saw it in its broadest cultural context.''         And although Ms. Spindler was an early champion of Mr. Ford, she did not put on kid gloves for him. ''Even when she wrote something scathing of about one of my collections, it was constructive, not malicious or cutting,'' he said. ''It was always grounded and concrete.''         Anna Wintour, the editor in chief of Vogue, whom Ms. Spindler regarded as a competitor when she became style editor of The Times Magazine, in 1998, said: ''She took criticism in a new direction. She wasn't afraid to tell the truth.''         Incensed by the fatal overdose in 1997 of Davide Sorrenti, a promising young fashion photographer, Ms. Spindler chided magazine editors for glamorizing ''heroin chic'' by depicting models in a drugged stupor. In a front-page article in The Times, Ms. Spindler wrote: ''What Mr. Sorrenti's death has revealed is that fashion photography is indeed a mirror of the tight-knit world that produces the photographs. And as long as drugs are unchecked in the industry, that image will be difficult to change.''         As a columnist and reviewer, Ms. Spindler applied her tart and witty outlook on such mid-1990's fashion trend setters as the deconstructionist Belgian designers who, after attending one of the strictest couture schools in Europe, started selling what were basically the stitched underpinnings of finished creations, and the reclamationist designers, mostly from Africa, who patched cast-off garments into novel creations. Both trends trickled into the mass market, in touches like unraveling hems, visible seams and mismatched patterns.         In a front-page article on Sept. 5, 1995, she noted a new piety on parade, marked by store windows and catalogs full of monastic robes, pilgrim's boots and dangling crosses. Perhaps, she wrote, ''the financially strained fashion industry is seeking salvation from above.''         A Midwesterner in both her mettle and plain English, Ms. Spindler was born in Michigan City, Ind. After graduating from Indiana University in 1985 with a degree in journalism, she moved to New York and worked in entry-level jobs at several Condé Nast magazines. In two years, she went from writing press releases for Bride's magazine to turning out highly detailed feature articles for The Daily News Record, the men's fashion journal of Fairchild Publications. Even in her reporting of the nuts and bolts of the garment trade, an authoritative voice -- and, equally, a sharp wit -- began to emerge.         Ms. Spindler was subsequently made associate features editor of W Europe in Paris, a city she would come to know as well as New York. In 1993, she joined The Times as a columnist on the Tuesday fashion page, where she used her training at Fairchild to engage in scoop warfare with the former colleagues at Women's Wear Daily. In 1994, The Times created the position of fashion critic for Ms. Spindler, making her an equal with the paper's other critics and acknowledging the weight of her view on a subject she not only knew in depth but also believed should be taken seriously.         In the midst of being treated for breast cancer, in 1998, she married Mr. Benabib, a television producer, whom she had met on a blind date in 1995. In the fall of 1998, after recovering from that cancer, she took the job of style editor of The Times Magazine, bringing a cultural vibrancy to the pages that had not existed before.         Her illness was not a subject she dwelled on, though she knew everything about it. She continued to supervise the coverage in the style sections and supplements of the magazine until last summer. In November, she relinquished that post and was named critic at large for culture and style.         Besides her husband, Ms. Spindler is survived by her mother, Sally Spindler of Tampa, Fla., and a sister, Bonnie, of San Francisco.       
         Gail Hall Zarr, a former managing editor of the Zagat Surveys series of  restaurant, hotel and travel guides, died last Saturday at her home in  Manhattan. She was 50.         The cause was complications of uterine cancer, said her husband, Gary Zarr. Mrs. Zarr began working at Zagat in 1994, rising to managing editor from senior editor. She developed new guides and oversaw the publication. ''She was responsible for more than 60 books, and was one of the key people in building our editorial group,'' said Tim Zagat, the company's publisher.         After leaving Zagat in 2001, she wrote a Barnes & Noble guide, ''Getting Into College'' (2003).         A 1975 graduate of New York University, Mrs. Zarr received a masters degree in English literature there in 1985. She was formerly the director of publications for the fundraising campaign at Barnard College and a public relations associate at the New York Public Library.         She is survived by her husband; a son, Daniel; a daughter, Emily; her mother, Linda Hall of Jefferson, N.Y.; and a sister, Debra Hall of New York City.       
         Frances Partridge, the last of the spectacularly talented and irreverent group of British writers and artists who coalesced as the Bloomsbury group in the years before World War I, died in London on Feb. 5. She was 103.         Ms. Partridge's death was announced by her literary agency, Rogers, Coleridge & White Ltd., which said she died in her apartment. She was surrounded there by remnants of the Bloomsbury group's heyday, including their books, one of them the letters of her friend Virginia Woolf, and their art, including the painter Dora Carrington's famous portrait of Lytton Strachey.         She was one of the last firsthand chroniclers of Bloomsbury, publishing two volumes of autobiography and six volumes of her diaries, beginning when she was 78. The books captivated a public increasingly fascinated by the socialist, pacifist and intellectually superior -- not to mention sexually adventurous -- bohemians of Bloomsbury, a leafy central London neighborhood.         Her story seemed as much literature as life, even as it was lived. When Ralph Partridge and Frances Marshall fell in love in 1923, Ralph was married to Dora Carrington, who was in love with Strachey, an eminent biographer and critic. But Strachey was in love with Ralph, who, Frances wrote, was ''hopelessly heterosexual'' and could not reciprocate. All, of course, lived in the same house.         Such was life among the Bloomsbury group, whose members also included John Maynard Keynes, E. M. Forster and Roger Fry, the art historian who coined the term Post-Impressionism. The group was not a school, as is commonly understood in artistic circles, but a remarkably talented collection of intellectuals who liked to eat good French food and converse, among other activities.         Ms. Partridge was actually on the fringes of the group, somewhat distantly connected by marriage to Duncan Grant, the Post-Impressionist painter and designer, as well as by her husband's first marriage, to Carrington. Another link was Julia Strachey, Lytton Strachey's niece and Ms. Partridge's oldest friend.         Ms. Partridge survived another old friend, the Shakespearean scholar George Rylands, who died in 1999, making her the last person who experienced the Bloomsbury phenomenon close up as an adult. (Angelica Garnett, the daughter of Duncan Grant and Vanessa Bell, Virginia Woolf's sister, published a well-reviewed book about her Bloomsbury childhood, ''Deceived by Kindness,'' in 1985.)         Ms. Partridge staked her claim to Bloomsbury history by writing it down. She suggested she survived to be ''some kind of archive.''         She brought life to her account, writing of Keynes's wife, the Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova, as ''a delightful little person,'' and likening Forster's laugh to a sneeze. She told how Fry explained ''in his beautiful deep voice why it was wicked to like peacock blue.'' Virginia Woolf, she said, had ''irresistible cracked charm.''         Frances Catherine Marshall was born in London on March 15, 1900, and was brought up on Bedford Square, in the heart of Bloomsbury. Her father was William Cecil Marshall, an architect, the runner-up in the first Wimbledon final in 1877 and a friend of Darwin. Her mother, the former Margaret Anna Lloyd, was a suffragist who took the 6-year-old Frances to a protest. Henry James, a family chum, cuddled her as a baby.         An atheist by 12, Ms. Partridge attended Bedales, a progressive school where naked swimming was allowed, except off the high dive, ''since it was 12 feet high and its occupant was visible for miles,'' she wrote.         Ms. Partridge attended Cambridge, where she went ''dancing mad'' and studied English for two years, then switched to courses she hoped would lead to a job in applied psychology. They did: she researched why waitresses drop china.         She soon took a job in a bookstore frequented by Bloomsbury figures. Among them was her future husband, Reginald Sherring Partridge, known as Ralph. A World War I hero and former Oxford rower, he was an employee of Hogarth Press, owned by Leonard and Virginia Woolf.         Frances and Ralph married in 1933, a year after Strachey died. His death had led Carrington to commit suicide. The couple were awakened by their gardener with the news, an oft-noted detail.         ''I would have thought people would find it rather dull, but they still seem fascinated,'' Ms. Partridge said in 1994, speaking of the events surrounding the ménage. ''I supposed because Carrington died for love.''         Together, the Partridges spent nine years editing the eight volumes of Charles C. F. Greville's memoirs, which recorded three British monarchs' reigns. In the years after the war, Ms. Partridge became known as a translator of French and Spanish books.         She was devastated by the deaths of her husband, in 1960, and of their son, Burgo, named for a Trollope character, three years later. She wrote of ''the black velvet oblivion I dream about.''         She is survived by her granddaughter, Sophie, and two great-granddaughters.         In 1978, at 78, she published ''A Pacifist's War,'' a memoir of the World War II years, following it three years later with ''Love in Bloomsbury: Memories,'' which led Anatole Broyard, writing in The New York Times, to conclude that the denizens of Bloomsbury may have been ''too charming for their own good.''         The books kept coming, just as her violin performances (she was an accomplished musician) continued well into her 90's. Craig Brown, a British critic who reviewed her fifth and penultimate volume of daily journals, ''Diaries: 1939-1972'' (2001), thought that the story went on a bit.         ''There are an awful lot of days when nothing of general interest really happens: someone we have never heard of drops by for lunch (full menu included) with a second person we have never heard of, and they all gossip vaguely about what a third person we never heard of thinks of a fourth person we never heard of,'' he wrote.         In 2001 another critic, Adam Nicolson, provided something of an explanation, writing that Ms. Partridge, who in her later years was sometimes compared to the Queen Mother as an English institution, lived ''her life in complete sentences.''       
         Joan McCord, a criminologist who marshaled mountains of evidence to question the effectiveness of social programs championed by both liberals and conservatives, died Tuesday at her home in Narberth, Pa. She was 73.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Robert.         In 12 books and many other writings, Dr. McCord, a professor at Temple University, disputed the effectiveness in fighting crime of boys' clubs, summer camps, programs in which young offenders visit prisons, D.A.R.E. (Drug Abuse Resistance Education) and other popular programs.         The first woman to be president of the American Society of Criminology, she was known for her use of longitudinal studies, which follow subjects for many years. Her goal was to examine the long-term effects of programs, ranging from individual mentoring programs often favored by conservatives to social work efforts frequently advocated by liberals.         Dr. McCord believed that just as the government monitors the effectiveness of pharmaceuticals, the public should examine data to determine if well-meaning interventions to help people might, in fact, be harmful. Often, she found that programs had no built-in procedure to evaluate their success.         More troubling, she said, was that officials sometimes resisted evaluation of programs, in part because they regarded it as an affront to their good intentions. She also said she sensed a fear that solid criticism of one social program might brand all as ineffective.         ''That fear, perhaps justified in some quarters, would be like blocking publication of damaging effects of Celebrex, thalidomide, or estrogen because the publication could slow work in disease prevention,'' she wrote in the May 2003 issue of The Annals, the publication of the American Academy of Political and Social Science.         Her best-known longitudinal study was her 1978 follow-up on a youth-mentoring program done 30 years earlier in Cambridge and Somerville, Mass. She found that boys at high risk who had been given mentors, health-care services and summer camp fared worse in later life than a similar group of boys who were given nothing special. The 250 boys who got special services were more likely to become criminals, have trouble in their jobs and marriages, and become alcoholics, according to court, hospital and other records noted in her study.         A possible reason, Dr. McCord suggested, was that those boys had felt they were given the attention because something was wrong with them, making it a self-fulfilling prophecy. Her theory was that the boys who went to summer camp modeled themselves after camp troublemakers.         The counterintuitive result contradicted the statements of two-thirds of the participants that the program had helped them by giving them better values and keeping them off the streets.         In other studies, she found that some youths counseled by court-appointed volunteers fared worse than those who received no counseling. Her statistical analysis of a program in Australia that provided recreation for troubled adolescents found bad effects. And participants in the Scared Straight program, which takes young offenders from many locales to visit prisons, were arrested more often than a control group, she found.         She said that D.A.R.E., the popular nationwide ''just say no'' drug education program in which law enforcement officers spend time in schools talking about drugs, alcohol and violence, may actually have contributed to drug use, according to her analysis of statistics from the program.         Joan Fish was born in Manhattan on Aug. 4, 1930. After graduating from Stanford in 1952, she did graduate work in philosophy at Harvard and Stanford. She earned her doctorate in sociology from Stanford in 1968.         She wrote some of her early papers with her first husband, William M. McCord. Their marriage ended in divorce. Both he and her second husband, Carl A. Silver, are dead.         Dr. McCord is survived by her sons, Geoffrey Sayre-McCord of Durham, N.C., and Robert McCord of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; her ward, whom she regarded as a family member, Tom Underwood of Boston; her brother, Robert Fish of Santa Cruz, Calif.; her sister, Connie Arnosti of Milwaukee; and four grandsons.         Her often pithy remarks appeared in articles about crime in many newspapers and magazines. The New York Times in 1996 asked her about a 12-year-old arrested on charges of gang rape and murder and who was turned in by his mother.         Of the mother's dilemma, Dr. McCord said, ''It's almost impossible to imagine a good thing to do with a gun-toting 12-year-old.''       
         Princess Juliana, the modest and beloved queen of The Netherlands for 32 years, died early Saturday. She was 94.         The government announced that she had died of pneumonia at the Soestdijk Palace, her longtime home, surrounded by three of her four daughters, including Queen Beatrix. Her fourth daughter, Christina, arrived shortly afterward from New York.         Remembering Juliana, who reigned from 1948 to 1980, Prime Minister Jan Peter Balkenende praised her sense of duty and personal warmth. ''In her own words, she had wanted to be a social worker if she had not been queen,'' he said.         In one way, she was a social worker. Born to privilege and wealth, Juliana made much effort, both as the queen and after she turned over her throne to her daughter, to bring the monarchy closer to the people. She spent much time visiting the sick, the handicapped, the aged and needy children. By many accounts, she helped steer successive governments toward policies promoting social welfare.         Her personal popularity probably helped save the monarchy during several severe crises, when critics agitated for the country to abandon the rituals and symbols of the past and become a modern republic.         Juliana spent her final years in seclusion. For some time she had been unable to recognize her family because of memory loss, said her husband, Prince Bernard, in 2001.         Mr. Balkenende, the prime minister, described her as a mother figure for the nation. ''Many of us feel the death of Princess Juliana as a personal loss,'' he said. ''Today our country in a sense has lost its mother.''         Flags were immediately lowered at Dutch official buildings, and mourners gathered in the rain outside her palace, about 25 miles southeast of Amsterdam. No date for the state burial has been set.         Born April 30, 1909 in The Hague, Juliana was a princess of the House of Orange-Nassau, the only child of Queen Wilhelmina and Prince Hendrik. She was 39 when her mother, who had been queen for 50 years, abdicated in her favor and passed the throne to her on Sept. 4, 1948.         Although Juliana was brought up in one of Europe's richest families, many Dutch found her endearing because, shy and soft-spoken, she exuded warmth and plainness. She said she found curtsies embarrassing and enjoyed being filmed while riding her bicycle in a flowery housewife's dress. She sent her children to state schools.         She would sometimes have her limousine pull up unannounced outside the home of one of her subjects, knock on the door and ask if she could come in for tea.         But her life was far from idyllic.         She and her husband, Prince Bernard, a German, and their two oldest daughters, then infants, were forced to flee in a truck, then by ship, to England when the Nazi army invaded The Netherlands in 1940, when her mother was still queen. The family spent much of the war in Canada and returned to a devastated, impoverished country at the end of the war.         Among her first acts as a young queen was not only overseeing reconstruction at home, but also dealing with conflicts in the Dutch colony of Indonesia. She handed back sovereignty to the Indonesians in in 1949.         In 1947, Christina, her youngest daughter, was born almost blind. Juliana blamed herself because she had contracted German measles just before giving birth.         With doctors saying they could do little, she turned to a faith healer. Her close relationship with Greet Hofmans, the healer -- who was a militant pacifist and had a penchant for the occult -- became a scandal and nearly led to the breakup of the royal marriage. The prince contended that the healer had a dangerous influence on his wife and, after a political furor, ensured that all contacts between the two women were broken.         Queen Juliana, in turn, stood by her husband during several scandals in which he was involved. Prince Bernard was often linked to extramarital relationships, which were treated as a public secret within the royal family and in some of the Dutch and European press.         But the greater upset to her reign occurred in 1976, when the government disclosed that Prince Bernard was involved in a bribery scandal and had accepted ''dishonorable offers and favors'' from the Lockheed Corp., which was eager to sell aircraft to the Dutch military.         The prince, by many accounts, was spared criminal prosecution because of public sympathy for Queen Juliana's plight. The distraught queen privately told the government she would abdicate. Fearing a constitutional crisis and a public outcry, the government merely stripped the prince of his military, charitable and diplomatic tasks.         When Juliana did abdicate, in 1980, on her 71st birthday, she took evident pride in handing the throne to her daughter Beatrix. ''Everyone getting older, sooner or later must face the sober fact that one's strength is fading,'' she said in her farewell message, adding that it would not be responsible to carry on.         She declined the title of queen mother and chose to be called princess instead because she wanted to stress that she was taking a step backward.         Princess Juliana is survived by her husband and four daughters and numerous grandchildren.         In a nationwide television address on Saturday, Prime Minister Balkenende recalled Juliana's fight for social causes and her talent for remaining positive.         She put people at ease, he said. He described one of Juliana's Christmas messages, when she said, ''Every person has a light that can shine anywhere and anytime.''       
         Dorothy Denny Scardino, a jazz pianist who rubbed elbows with the form's superstars but found her biggest following through a 25-year gig in a Manhattan bank lobby, died on March 9 at a hospice. She was 82 and had recently been told that she had cancer, her son Donald said.         Drawn to the city from a dairy farm in tiny Jefferson, N.Y., Mrs. Scardino played with the Joe Venuti Band and at the Stork Club during World War II.         ''Her goal was to come to New York and be surrounded by people, and play the piano,'' her son said. She appeared with Lester Lanin's Society Orchestra, and recorded two collections for the A440 label, ''Dottie Denny Digs the Duke'' and ''Dottie Denny Plays Edgar Sampson.''         After marrying Charles Scardino, a bass player, she put aside her career to raise their four children in Queens. With the children grown, she took a job playing classics on a grand piano inside the Manhattan Savings Bank branch at Third Avenue and 86th Street.         She started in 1970, at the invitation of the branch manager, and regaled the customers with her interpretations of hits by Irving Berlin, Duke Ellington, Stephen Sondheim and others. People came in just to listen, tapping their toes in time to her music, and some may have opened accounts because of her. She played there until 1995, when the bank was sold and its new owner decided to do away with the music.         Always elegantly dressed, Mrs. Scardino played what appealed to her, but she also took requests from her audience, which often included people from the neighborhood who did not have accounts at the bank.         When she was cast in an episode of the television series ''The Days and Nights of Molly Dodd,'' the title character, after a loan application was rejected, asked her to play ''Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?''         In addition to her son Donald, of Scarsdale, N.Y., she is survived by her daughter, Nina Coe of Montevallo, Ala.; two other sons, Charles Jr., of Manhattan, and David, of Los Angeles; and eight grandchildren.       
         Marge Schott, who evoked the image of a charming eccentric when she bought the Cincinnati Reds in 1984 but became a baseball pariah for offensive racial and ethnic remarks, died yesterday in Cincinnati. She was 75.         Her death was announced by Christ Hospital, where she had been treated for several weeks. She had lung-related problems in recent years, The Associated Press said.         When she took control of the Reds, Mrs. Schott, a socially prominent widow and heir to an industrial fortune, was the only female owner in the major leagues who had bought a team in her own right. Joan Kroc of the San Diego Padres and Jean Yawkey of the Boston Red Sox had inherited their franchises from their husbands.         She appeared at her introductory news conference with her 170-pound St. Bernard, Schottzie, who, clad in a Reds cap, perched on the feet of Manager Pete Rose. She maintained that in purchasing the team, she might have prevented its move out of Cincinnati. It seemed that she might be an astute baseball promoter, and she was a formidable contributor to Cincinnati area charities.         But a series of gaffes and intolerant remarks caused Mrs. Schott to lose control of the Reds in 1999. In her 15 years as owner, a franchise that had thrived in the 1970's as the Big Red Machine had seven managers but only one pennant-winner, the World Series champions of 1990.         Mrs. Schott's image first soured in November 1992 when several former Reds executives said that she had referred to players and business associates using racial and ethnic slurs. In an interview that month with The New York Times, she said that ''Hitler was good in the beginning, but he went too far.''         Mrs. Schott denied she was a racist, but acknowledged she had sometimes used a racial epithet.         Asked in a deposition for a lawsuit brought by a former Reds employee if she was prejudiced against Jews in light of possessing a Nazi armband -- a war souvenir -- she responded: ''No. They are not smarter than us, just sharper.'' The uproar over Mrs. Schott's remarks prompted baseball's leadership to suspend her from day-to-day oversight of the Reds for the 1993 season. After she made a similar comment about Hitler in May 1996, she was forced to relinquish her daily control of the Reds again and she never regained it.         In October 1999, Mrs. Schott turned over control of the team to a group headed by Carl Lindner, one of the limited partners, in a $67 million deal. She remained in Reds ownership as a limited partner.         Mrs. Schott was a major contributor to local charitable causes, including Children's Hospital and the Cincinnati Zoo.         ''Marge was a paradox,'' Mayor Charlie Luken of Cincinnati told The Cincinnati Enquirer upon her death. ''While there is no excusing some of the indelicate things she said, there was a kindness to Marge that made her a woman of the people.''         She was born Margaret Unnewehr, the second of five daughters of Edward Unnewehr, a Cincinnati native who made a fortune in the lumber business.         ''My father was Achtung-German,'' Mrs. Schott recalled in 1992. ''He used to ring a bell when he wanted my mother. When I was 21 and went to vote, he told me who to vote for. I said, 'Yes, Daddy.' ''         She married Charles Schott, a member of a wealthy Cincinnati family, in 1952, and gained notice for the parties she held for friends and charities at her mansion in the suburb of Indian Hill.         When her husband died of a heart attack in 1968, Mrs. Schott inherited auto dealerships in Cincinnati and interests in insurance, brick manufacturing, concrete products and landfills.         She became a limited partner in the Reds' ownership in 1981 and was named the general partner on Dec. 21, 1984, when she purchased the controlling interest held by the brothers James and William Williams and shares held by two other limited partners, reportedly for $11 million.         Mrs. Schott called her purchase of the Reds a ''Christmas gift to the people of Cincinnati.'' She said she was concerned that the Williams brothers might sell the franchise, which reported $4 million in losses in 1984, to an out-of-city group.         Mrs. Schott promoted the team at functions, and she loved to take part in the Wave from her box seat at Riverfront Stadium. But the allegations in 1992 concerning offensive remarks tarnished her image.         The next February, baseball's executive council suspended Mrs. Schott for the 1993 season and fined her $25,000 for ''the most base and demeaning type of racial and ethnic stereotyping.''         Mrs. Schott had apologized for any offensive remarks, but in an interview for ABC-TV's ''Primetime Live'' after the suspension, she suggested the inquiry was a ''witch hunt'' and said, ''I think if I had been a man this would never have happened.''         A month after that suspension was imposed, baseball's executive council banned Schottzie 02 -- another of her St. Bernards -- from the Riverfront Stadium field, citing ''numerous complaints by the players.''         Mrs. Schott had no children, to her great regret. She bestowed great affection on her dogs and delighted in parading with her St. Bernards around the Reds' ballpark and rubbing the dogs' fur on her players.         In yet another incident, Lou Piniella, who had taken the Reds to the World Series championship in his first year as manager, rejected a two-year contract extension after the 1992 season. He said later that a major factor in his leaving was the failure of the Reds' management to support him in a defamation suit -- later dropped -- that was filed by Umpire Gary Darling and the Major League Umpires Association.         Another embarrassment for Mrs. Schott arrived in 1996.         After the season-opening game at Cincinnati had been called off when Umpire John McSherry sustained a fatal heart attack in the first inning, Mrs. Schott told The Cincinnati Enquirer: ''I feel cheated. Nobody feels worse than me.''         She compounded that gaffe with her sympathy offering to the umpiring crew; according to published reports, it was a recycled bouquet given to her by the team's television affiliate.         On June 12, 1996, Mrs. Schott agreed to give up daily operation of the Reds through the 1998 season, having been told by baseball's executive council that she would be suspended again if she did not do so. She turned over day-to-day affairs to John Allen, the team's controller.         Mrs. Schott is survived by her sisters, Charlotte Crane, Winnie Fraser, Caroline Paddock and Mary Elizabeth Unnewehr.         ''I guess I always thought of her as a tragic figure,'' the former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent told The Associated Press. ''I think she tried very hard to do the right things for baseball, but she had some enormous limitations and she had some difficulty overcoming them.''       
         Mary Lindsay, who as John V. Lindsay's accomplished, blue-blood wife brought casual elegance and political acumen to his campaigns for New York City mayor and other offices while fiercely protecting the family's limited privacy, died yesterday in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 77.         The cause was cancer, her daughter Margaret Picotte said. Mrs. Lindsay lived in Hilton Head, S.C.         Mr. Lindsay, who was mayor from 1966 to 1973, died on Dec. 19, 2000, at age 79.         Mrs. Lindsay, whose energy was suggested by her vigorous bicycle rides in Central Park and the countless coffee hours she held during her husband's campaigns, was her husband's most trusted adviser. James Reston described her in The New York Times as ''smarter than 16 Yale men,'' and Mr. Lindsay once volunteered that she was tougher than he was.         ''You can say anything in front of Mary,'' he said in a remark quoted by Vogue magazine in 1969. ''Besides, it'll save me having to tell her all over again.''         Mrs. Lindsay preceded Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis by three years at Miss Porter's School and Vassar and redecorated Gracie Mansion in the fine manner in which the first lady had made over the White House. But Mrs. Lindsay thought designer gowns were a waste of money and bought her clothes off the shelf in department stores. Reflecting her political sagacity, she explained that locally made clothes were a critical part of the city's economy.         Her never-disguised devotion to her children struck a responsive chord with many mothers.         ''I have a strict rule,'' she said in an interview with The New York Post in 1971. ''Nothing is scheduled for me after 4 p.m. That's when Johnnie comes home from school.''         She was also protective of her husband's most precious asset, time -- not to mention his peace of mind.         ''When he needs something done I may scream around the house,'' she said in a 1969 interview with The Times. ''But when he gets home, it's all peaches and cream.''         Mary Anne Harrison was born on Oct. 30, 1926, in Richmond, Va. Her father, Randolph Carter Harrison, was a senior vice president of Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company. Her mother, the former Mary Hawes, was president of the Garden Club of America.         She and her two brothers grew up in Greenwich, Conn. She enjoyed a tomboy's life, developing a reputation for independence. She needed only three years to graduate from Vassar in 1947 with a degree in psychology.         In her last year of college, she and John met when they were members of the wedding party of Nancy Walker Bush, sister of the former president George H. W. Bush, and Alexander Ellis. Mrs. Lindsay told The Post in 1965 that she first thought Mr. Lindsay was ''horrid'' because he did not pay any attention to her.         ''Later, when we knew each other a lot better, he said he had been assigned to be very nice to the groom's younger sister,'' she said. ''I now accept that.''         In 1948, in the kitchen of his parents' home, he asked her to marry him, she said. But he maintained he was only getting a beer.         ''He still says that,'' she said. ''But I know John. If he wanted to get out of something, he would have managed.''         Before her marriage she taught at the Mary C. Wheeler School in Providence, R.I., and at the Buckley School in New York.         They were married in June 1949 and moved into a $63-a-month apartment in Stuyvesant Town in Manhattan, according to Diplomat magazine. Mr. Lindsay was making $3,600 a year with his law firm. After the couple's first two children were born, they moved into a larger Stuyvesant Town residence that cost $83 a month. Eventually, they bought a $10,000 co-op.         She at first thought she would devote herself to being a homemaker. ''I thought it would be glorious,'' she said to The Post. ''Nothing to do but clean and be a good little housewife. I was bored to death.''         She soon got a job at a nearby nursery school until her first child, now Katharine Lake, of Connecticut, was born.         In addition to her, Mrs. Lindsay is survived by two other daughters, Margaret Picotte of Florida and Anne Lindsay of Massachusetts; her son, John Jr. of Connecticut; and five grandchildren.         The demands of motherhood were soon joined by the rigors of campaigning as Mr. Lindsay won three terms as a congressman from the city's ''Silk Stocking District,'' serving from 1959 to 1965.         She described their days at Gracie Mansion as ''beginning with chaos, ending with chaos and with a slight climactic middle.''         The verbal skills of the slender, green-eyed woman were suggested by her answer when asked how she felt when her husband was described as ''the creator of all urban evil,'' by The Post in 1971. She at first snapped that people who criticized Mr. Lindsay were ignorant.         Mrs. Lindsay quickly recovered.         ''Goodness,'' she said, ''criticism is part of our heritage. It's an important feature of this country.''         Robert Price, who helped direct Mr. Lindsay's four congressional races and first mayoral campaign, once gave Mrs. Lindsay the ultimate politician's compliment. He called her ''a political force more powerful than patronage.''       
         Estée Lauder, the last great independent titan of the cosmetics industry, who convinced generations of women that her beauty creams were ''jars of hope'' in their quest for the eternal look of youth, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Her family, in announcing her death, said she was 97.         ''The pursuit of beauty is honorable,'' Mrs. Lauder used to say. And she clearly believed that the business of beauty was just as honorable. No one but a believer could have given so much of herself in becoming an internationally respected strategist in the age-old struggle against wrinkles, sags, bags and blemishes. Her weapons in that effort were creams, powders, ointments, potions and muds, many containing top-secret emollients. And if they didn't do the trick, she had an array of scents, equally secret in their constitution, that might befog man's vision of woman aging.         Her efforts resulted in the establishment of a company estimated to be worth about $5 billion when it went public in 1995 and she was given the title of founding chairwoman. In 2003, it had 21,500 employees and an estimated worth of about $10 billion. Its products are sold in more than 130 countries across five continents.         Estée Lauder Companies was not formally established until 1946 but its roots go back to the 1920's with facial creams concocted over a gas stove in a modest kitchen by Mrs. Lauder's uncle, John Schotz. It was nurtured financially and technically years later by Arnold L. van Ameringen, a Dutch-born industrialist. The company grew exponentially in the 1950's with the introduction of a bath oil called Youth-Dew, the creation of which is variously attributed to Mrs. Lauder and Mr. van Ameringen.         In the years after the start of her almost messianic crusade to give women the perennial bloom of youth, Mrs. Lauder marketed a variety of other beauty aids, among them Super-Rich All Purpose Creme, Cleaning Oil, Creme Pack and a skin lotion (all of them the creations of Dr. Schotz). In all, she marketed some 2,000 individual shades and items produced by five Lauder companies: Estée Lauder, Clinique, Origins, Prescriptives and (for men) Aramis. Among the fragrances she introduced were Estée (1968), Azuree (1969), Aliage (1972), Private Collection (1973), Beautiful (1985) and Pleasures (1995).         In 1995 the company also entered into a licensing agreement with the Tommy Hilfiger Corporation to market Tommy, a line of fragrances, and with Make-Up Artists Cosmetics of Toronto to distribute its MAC products outside North America.         ''I love my product,'' Mrs. Lauder once said. ''I love to touch the creams, smell them, look at them, carry them with me. A person has to love her harvest if she's to expect others to love it.''         Mrs. Lauder also loved to touch her customers. During the period when she was building her business, she invariably showed up at stores where her products were being introduced and, with no provocation at all, whip out a jar and rub its contents on the wrist or face of a prospective customer so that her skin would acquire ''a gentle glow.''         She also understood the rewards that come from generosity and she was known in the industry for her free samples and particularly for the concept of ''gift with purchase.'' She introduced these creative marketing measures when her company was in its infancy and she was advised by an agency that the $50,000 she had available for advertising was not enough to have any effect.         Although she was protective toward those who trusted her to create effective products, she used stark candor to describe her competitors, all of them ferocious and all of whom she outlived by many years. She referred to Charles Revson as ''my arch and implacable enemy'' and she said that Elizabeth Arden was ''not a nice woman, not a generous woman.'' She said that Sam Rubin of Fabergé was ''patronizing even for those prefeminist days'' and that although Helena Rubenstein may have looked like a czarina, ''the skin on her neck was less than perfect.''         Perfection in the face of woman consumed Mrs. Lauder, and so did her desire to make a lot of money and leave the conditions of her childhood behind her. ''Someday, I will have whatever I want,'' she is said to have predicted many years ago. By the late 1980's, with personal assets of $233 million and a listing in Forbes's gallery of the 400 richest Americans, it was clear that she had made her prediction come true.         Although the mythmaking that is so much of the magic of the beauty industry led many women to believe that Estée Lauder was born in Europe to an aristocratic family, she was a New Yorker and not an aristocrat at all. Josephine Esther Mentzer was born at home in Corona, Queens, on July 1, 1908, according to several biographies, although her family believes it may have been two years earlier. She was the daughter of Max Mentzer, a hardware man who was the proprietor of a hay and seed store, and Rose Schotz Rosenthal Mentzer, a woman who was much interested in beauty regimens.         The Mentzers were hard-working immigrants and Esther, destined to become known to the world by the diminutive of Estée, recalled well the Christmastime wrapping of gifts of hammers and nails, her father's gifts to his customers.         In her 1985 autobiography, ''Estée, A Success Story,'' Mrs. Lauder recalled her mother as ''a Hungarian beauty whose mother was a French Catholic and whose father was a Hungarian Jew.'' She described her father as ''an elegant, dapper monarchist in Europe, who, when transported to a new country, still carried a cane and gloves on Sundays.''         In interviews conducted over the years with various journalists, Mrs. Lauder said much that indicated her beginnings were quite genteel and comfortable. But Lee Israel, whose unauthorized biography, ''Estée Lauder, Beyond the Magic,'' was also published in 1985, maintained that the Lauder family's life in a working-class Italian neighborhood was much more modest than Mrs. Lauder would acknowledge.         Whatever her circumstances, there was no quarrel about the suggestion that as a young girl, Estée, a petite blonde, was known for her lovely skin and her determination to always look good. This determination was heightened when, as a student at Newtown High School in Queens, she became interested in the work of her uncle, John Schotz.         He had come to the United States from Hungary in 1900 with considerable training in chemistry. People referred to him as Dr. Schotz, although it is not clear that he had a doctorate. Whatever his background, he created a number of beauty products, including Six-in-One Cold Cream, Dr. Schotz Viennese Cream and a number of fragrances.         But the New Way Laboratory, which he created in 1924, was hardly limited to the needs of the beautiful people. It also produced a poultry-lice killer, a cure for mange, suppositories, a cream that was touted as promoting the building of muscles, a freckle remover and even embalming fluid. Years later, a chemist for Revlon said that although Dr. Schotz's beauty-care products were heavy and ''very old fashioned,'' they were good for their time and effective, especially for dry skin. One of the Schotz products even contained a primitive form of sunscreen.         Estée studied his homemade products closely and, since Dr. Schotz was no businessman, helped him to sell them. Estée said little about her past and it is not clear that she even graduated from Newtown High. But in school or out, she remained fascinated with his beauty aids and was still promoting them in 1930 when she married Joseph Lauter, whom she had been dating for about three years. He was the son of William and Lillian Lauter, who had come to the United States from the part of Austria known as Galicia. Mr. Lauter had tried his hand without much success in both the silk and button businesses. The name was changed to ''Lauder'' later in the decade.         Their marriage foundered and they were divorced in 1939. Their separation lasted until 1942, when Estée told her friends that Mr. Lauder was a very nice man and that ''I don't know why I broke off with him.'' They remarried that December and remained together until his death in 1982.         She is survived by her sons, Leonard A., the chairman of the company, and Ronald S., chairman of Clinique Laboratories; four grandchildren, including William, who will become chief executive of the Estée Lauder Companies on July 1; and six great-grandchildren.         While Mrs. Lauder and her husband were apart she met and became close to Mr. van Ameringen, who became president and chairman of International Flavors and Fragrances, a company that formulates fragrances for many well-known beauty houses and has no connection with the Lauder empire. They became lifelong friends and Mr. van Ameringen provided both credit and, some said, product formula for the firm that would bear Mrs. Lauder's name. From the beginning, she was its chief executive and made its most important marketing and product development decisions.         In 1944, the Lauders opened concessions in beauty salons in New York and sold products to out-of-town salons through jobbers. Leonard Lauder, who became president of the company in the 1970's, recalled that ''we had a Boston wholesaler, the Samuel Bernstein Hair Company, and Mr. Bernstein used to talk to me about his son Lenny.''         Mrs. Lauder would go on the road, trying to induce finer stores to feature her merchandise. ''I have the secrets,'' she would tell prospective clients. ''Start the New Year with a new face.''         The concessions were closed in 1946 and gradually the company sold to stores like Saks Fifth Avenue. That helped to give her products the prestigious aura they needed for more aggressive marketing.         The introduction of Youth-Dew and Mrs. Lauder's sales expertise combined to take the company from a sales volume of no more than $400 a week to around $5,000 in the early 1950's. It still had no sales staff as such, but it was gaining an image of quality from the department stores in which it was displayed. By 1958, when Leonard joined the company, sales had soared to about $800,000 a year.         The company began to grow more rapidly. In 1965, Mrs. Lauder opened her first beauty ''spa'' in Bloomingdale's New York store. She planned her counters personally and determined that each ''would be a tiny, shining spa -- complete.''         ''I'd make sure the color I chose was the same wonderful 'in between a blue and a green' that whispered elegance, aristocracy, and also complemented bathroom wallpapers,'' she said.         By this time, Estée Lauder was well on her way to becoming the doyenne of beauty and her list of friends began to reflect her regal image. The Duchess of Windsor had long been a friend and now there were others. Princess Grace of Monaco sent her Christmas cards and visited her in New York. Many socially prominent people invited her to their parties, among them the Begum Aga Khan, C. Z. Guest, Nancy Reagan and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. In January 1978, when she received the Legion of Honor, it did not seem to bother the French that Estée Lauder's fragrances were outselling Chanel's by 3 to 1. Gerard Gaussen, the consul general of France, said that she ''represents what we French admire most about Americans -- brains and heart.''         Mrs. Lauder was a generous contributor to civic causes and charities. The Lauder Foundation was set up in the 1960's and it has, among other things, set up three playgrounds in Central Park. The Joseph H. Lauder Institute of Management and International Studies was founded at the University of Pennsylvania in 1983.         It was probably inevitable that such a woman would have her detractors, too. Some said Mrs. Lauder had never adequately compensated John Schotz, who died in the 1960's in modest circumstances at a time when Estée Lauder Inc. was grossing around $14 million a year. Others, according to her biographer, Lee Israel, complained that she denied or played down her Jewishness (Ms. Israel said that Mrs. Lauder told one interviewer that she was half Italian and convent-bred), that she was a name-dropper, a social climber, and not entirely loyal. Ms. Israel quotes an ex-secretary to the duchess of Windsor as complaining that after the duke died and the duchess became infirm, Mrs. Lauder ''deserted'' her.         Unperturbed by the naysayers, Mrs. Lauder lived life vigorously, taking from it what she wanted and rejecting things that would take her away from the people and places she knew. Thus, she rejected President Nixon's offer to make her ambassador to Luxembourg (she blamed her husband, who reportedly said, ''I'm not going to carry her bags'').         In 1982, she demonstrated her approach to life. When she felt that her ruby and diamond tiara clashed horribly with her turquoise dress, she immediately switched to a more suitable gold and diamond crown. ''You know how it is,'' she told Charlotte Curtis of The New York Times. ''You have to wear something.''       
         Rosemary Park Anastos, an advocate for women's education and the liberal arts and a former president of Barnard College and Connecticut College for Women, died April 17 at her home in Los Angeles, said a niece, Joan Citron. She was 97.         Dr. Park, as she was known professionally, came from a family of academics: her mother was a teacher, her father and brother were also college presidents. When she left the Barnard presidency in 1967 after five years, she became the first woman to be a vice chancellor at the University of California. At her Barnard inauguration in 1963, she said that ''to avoid becoming a nursery school to the university with custodial and elementary responsibilities only,'' the college must make its liberal arts more sophisticated. She said that meant moving beyond acquiring facts to the mastery of subjects like advanced mathematics, political and economic theory and classical philosophy.         At Connecticut, where she was president from 1947 to 1962, she expanded the student body by one-third, strengthened the curriculum, built major new buildings and was a tireless fund-raiser. She made the campus a national center for modern dance and generally enhanced the college's reputation. When Yale gave her an honorary degree in 1958, it said she had been a major force in ''adding a bright star to the galaxy of liberal arts colleges for women.''         At Barnard, she followed a similar agenda, strengthening the curriculum, adding major buildings and raising money. But she left after five years, pulled by her marriage in 1965 to Milton Vasil Anastos, a professor of Byzantine Greek at the University of California, Los Angeles. He died in 1997. Dr. Park is survived by her stepson, Milton V. Anastos Jr., of Warwick, R.I., and several nieces and nephews.         Of her departure for California, David Truman, dean of Columbia College, wrote in Barnard's alumnae magazine that although she was the only woman at many Columbia meetings, her wisdom and humor gave weight to her advice and made her ''one of the best men in the university.''         Not all of her dealings with Columbia were harmonious, however, as she related in an interview with Helen S. Astin, a U.C.L.A. colleague, in ''The Higher Education of Women: Essays in Honor of Rosemary Park.'' When she proposed a new science laboratory for Barnard, she said, Columbia discouraged her, saying its labs were sufficient. But, she said, Barnard did not control those labs, and the absence of its own lab would send a signal ''that it didn't believe in science for women.'' Barnard built a new lab.         Born in Andover, Mass., Dr. Park was the oldest of four children of J. Edgar Park, a minister raised in Ireland who became president of Wheaton College, in Massachusetts, and Grace Burtt Park, who taught Greek and mathematics. Her brother, William E. Park, was president of Simmons College, in Boston.         She studied German at Radcliffe and graduated summa cum laude. She later studied at the University of Bonn in 1930 and in 1934 earned a Ph.D. at the University of Cologne. She began teaching German part time, first at Wheaton, then at Connecticut College, where she became dean of freshmen, academic dean, acting president, then president.         She spoke and wrote widely on education, the role of women and other topics, often breaking from conventional wisdom. She told parents that they should encourage their children to take courses in advanced mathematics and French, because society would need scientists and linguists. She said that schools facing teacher shortages should think about using television and older students to help with the teaching; both, she said, had proved effective.         She often leavened her seriousness with wit. In one speech, she took a swipe at English usage: ''At some point in most of the professions, the regrettable expression 'load' arose: case load, patient load, teaching load,'' she said. ''Artists, as far as I know, do not refer to picture load, poem load or concert load.''         Although she supported women's education, she was not a zealot. In her interview with Dr. Astin, Dr. Park said that women's colleges were ''particularly important for girls who develop slowly,'' but said men might benefit ''from the same kind of protective environment.'' She predicted that women's colleges would become less necessary, and she won authority to establish Connecticut College for Men and then admitted men as graduate students.         She was an energetic fund-raiser at a time when it was not always viewed as dignified. To raise $3.1 million for Connecticut College, she crossed the country, meeting with executives who questioned the need to finance women's education.         She became a vice chancellor at U.C.L.A. in 1967, and then a professor. In 1980, she helped develop the Plato Society, a U.C.L.A. study program for retired people. Until a few months ago, she was a member herself, taking courses like ''Romantic Composers'' and ''Brain and Memory.''       
         Larisa Bogoraz, an early Soviet-era dissident whose moral stubbornness helped define the movement, died Tuesday at the age of 74. Colleagues said the cause of death was a series of strokes.         Ms. Bogoraz is best remembered for her participation in the first public demonstration of the dissident era, in 1968, when she and six others stood in Red Square in Moscow to protest the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia.         She was quickly arrested and spent four years in internal exile, after which she resumed her activities, in a pattern that would be repeated by many others over the years.         ''I lived like a free person,'' she said in an interview after the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991. ''Yes, they sent me to jail and exile, but I knew what I was doing was right according to my beliefs.''         She became active in human rights issues after the arrest of her first husband, Yuli Daniel, for anti-Soviet essays written together with his friend Andrei Sinyavsky, in 1965, the same year she received her doctorate in linguistics.         Ms. Bogoraz was a signer of many of the dissidents' main appeals over the years. She was co-author of an underground book, ''Memory,'' which chronicled Stalin's terror, and she was a leading contributor to the underground publication Chronicle of Current Events.         ''She was a moral influence since the beginning and her influence defined the course of this whole movement,'' said Lyuda Alekseyeva, a close friend and contemporary who now heads the Moscow Helsinki Group, a leading human rights organization.         Ms. Bogoraz's second husband, Anatoloy Marchenko, was another prominent dissident, with whom she wrote a number of appeals and who was arrested in 1980.         In 1986, Ms. Bogoraz helped start a campaign to free all political prisoners. But by the time the Soviet leader, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, began liberating prisoners in 1987, Mr. Marchenko had died.         In 1989 Ms. Bogoraz joined the reconstituted Moscow Helsinki Group and became a bridge between the older dissident movement and the country's new human rights campaigners.         ''With her death a part of the old tradition is going away,'' said Tanya Lokshina, one of the young leaders of the Helsinki Group.         ''Many people referred to her as a legend of the Soviet dissident movement,'' she said. ''But she was a very alive person, very vibrant, very intelligent, very involved and interested in new ideas and new concepts.''         She is survived by Aleksandr Daniel, a son from her first marriage, who is a historian at the Memorial human rights organization.       
         Mary McGrory, an unapologetic liberal who chronicled 50 years of scandal, war, Congressional turmoil and political heartbreak as a columnist for The Washington Star and The Washington Post, died on Wednesday at George Washington University Hospital. She was 85.         Ms. McGrory won the Pulitzer Prize for commentary in 1975 for her columns on Watergate. But her career had a remarkable range, from the 1954 Army-McCarthy hearings, where she first made her name, to the Bush administration and the war with Iraq, which she opposed in her final foreboding columns in March 2003. She suffered a stroke that month and did not return to her column. She had been in declining health ever since, said her nephew, Ted McGrory.         The daughter of a scholarly Boston postal clerk, Ms. McGrory was raised on Latin, poetry and a profoundly Irish love of the game of politics. She covered virtually every presidential campaign since 1956, drawn to their ''endless possibility,'' she once said. Her columns captured some of the greatest political characters of the era -- their loyalty, treachery, weaknesses, sacrifices, high causes and low moments.         She wrote a series of columns about the assassination and funeral of President John F. Kennedy that became one of the most evocative and enduring eulogies for the man and the times.         ''He was just home from the Pacific when I first saw him in 1946,'' she wrote. ''He was thin as a match and still yellow from malaria. But he was blithe and determined and wherever he went he was surrounded by young men who felt with him that the Irish had something more to give to American political life than a last hurrah.''         She was at the airport when Kennedy's body was flown back from Dallas, and she described the tearful, ''leaderless men of the New Frontier'' as they ''picked up their inexpressible burden'' of the young president's coffin. She then wrote a powerfully spare account of his funeral:         ''His old friend, Cardinal Cushing of Boston, who married him, baptized his children and prayed over him in the icy air of his inaugural, said a Low Mass. At the final prayers, after the last blessing, he suddenly added, 'dear Jack.' ''         Across the generations, Ms. McGrory was a fixture on Capitol Hill, summoning House members off the floor for a chat in the speaker's lobby, showing up every Tuesday to grab senators after their weekly party caucuses. She called Congress the ''federal entertainment center,'' and said she vastly preferred it to covering the White House, where ''there are all those courtiers,'' ''so full of themselves,'' who ''may or may not call you back.''         She wrote a column steeped in reporting at a time when other columnists increasingly focused on attitude, analysis and television appearances, and she did her own legwork well into her 80's.         ''I can't do it any other way,'' Ms. McGrory once said. ''I have to see, I have to hear. I'm primitive, I guess. I don't want anyone else doing my listening or watching for me.''         Her second cousin Brian McGrory, a columnist with The Boston Globe, recalled, ''She was hellbent on making sure every column was reported, hellbent on being out on the campaign trail, even when physically it wasn't the easiest thing for her.''         Nothing made her happier, Mr. McGrory added, than being in the bar of the Sheraton Wayfarer outside Manchester, N.H., when it functioned as a roiling intelligence center for politicians and journalists covering the New Hampshire primary.         Ms. McGrory was a ground-breaking woman in American newspapers, often the only woman or one of a very few on the campaign trail in her early days. But she played down the notion that this was always, necessarily, a hardship. A woman who increasingly acquired the manner of an aging countess, as her friend Phil Gailey, editor of editorials at The St. Petersburg Times in Florida put it, she was legendary on the campaign trail for enlisting male reporters as her porters.         In his memoir ''A Good Life,'' Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, wrote: ''In the 60's I had been allowed to carry her bags and typewriter during the presidential campaign. We were known as McGrory's bearers.'' Several generations of bearers followed after him.         Her path to political reporting was not easy. A graduate of Boston's elite Girls' Latin School and Emmanuel College, Ms. McGrory got her start as secretary to the book editor of The Boston Herald Traveler. She also wrote book reviews and the kind of features she called ''dog stories,'' but she was ''crazy'' about newspapering and felt stymied, Ms. McGrory said in an oral history for the Washington Press Club Foundation.         She moved to The Washington Star as a book reviewer in 1947. She got her big break in 1954, when her editor, Newbold Noyes, sent her to Capitol Hill to cover the Army-McCarthy hearings. He urged her to write her stories as if she were writing a letter to a favorite aunt. She thought of her Aunt Sarah, ''a very nice, lonely person in our family,'' she said later, and a genre was born. She viewed Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, she said, as ''an Irish bully,'' a type she had seen before.         ''For eight days,'' she wrote in an early column, ''the Army secretary has been having his honesty questioned, his motives impugned and his patriotism challenged. He has been bullied, baited and patronized. He has been treated like a stubborn and not very bright child. Throughout his ordeal, moreover, he has been subjected to the rather jostling familiarity of Senator McCarthy, who calls him 'Bob.' ''         Ms. McGrory went on to cover all the classic Congressional dramas, including the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. ''Nothing that Bill Clinton did in the matter of Monica Lewinsky shows any class or character,'' she wrote, but added: ''The Republicans are beyond reason. They are like people on New Year's Eve, determined to have a wild time, no matter the cost.''         She was intensely loyal to The Star, and while The Washington Post tried to woo her many times over the years, she did not make the move until The Star closed in 1981. Post editors often joked they were always second best to Ms. McGrory.         In 1998, when accepting the National Press Club's Fourth Estate Award, Ms. McGrory described her view of a Mary McGrory column. ''No great men call me,'' she said, proudly. ''You know who calls me? Losers. I am their mark.'' She added, ''If you want to abolish land mines. If you want to reform campaign spending'' or ''if you want to save children from abuse, or stupid laws, or thickheaded judges, you have my telephone number.''         ''All the places of little hope, that's my constituency,'' she said.         The Vietnam War was her great passion, and it framed her coverage of the 1968 presidential campaign, particularly the insurgent antiwar candidacy of Eugene J. McCarthy. But she ranged widely, with judgments that were often withering. Senator Edward M. Kennedy said ruefully, ''As Bobby once said, 'Mary is so gentle until she gets behind a typewriter.' ''         In a column about Richard M. Nixon's 1962 news conference after he lost the California governor's race, Ms. McGrory wrote: ''For Richard M. Nixon, it was exit snarling.'' She later made the Nixon administration's famous enemies list.         Ms. McGrory did not marry or have children, but had a large extended family, including two nieces, in addition to her nephew; a loyal group of Washington Star veterans; and a longtime relationship as the ultimate volunteer with St. Ann's Infant and Maternity Home.         She was also a hostess of some renown. Mr. Gailey remembers one McGrory party in 1982, a christening for his son, that featured Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill Jr. singing, ''If you're Irish, come into the parlor,'' while a Reagan White House aide, Michael K. Deaver, accompanied him on the piano.         When she accepted her press club award in 1998, Ms. McGrory declared, ''I should confess that I always felt a little sorry for people who didn't work for newspapers.''       
         Winson Hudson, a civil rights campaigner in rural Mississippi who flaunted her contempt for Ku Klux Klan intimidation by wearing a bright red dress the many times she marched up to the courthouse to try to register to vote, died on April 24. She was 87.         Her grandson Kempton Horton said she died at a hospital in Jackson, Miss., that she had fought to desegregate.         In 1963, Mrs. Hudson brought the first suit to desegregate schools in a rural Mississippi county and won the case the next year. In 1965, a black child attended a previously all-white school.         She began trying to register to vote at the Leake County courthouse in 1937 and finally succeeded in 1962, but not before repeatedly having to write out and then explain a lengthy passage from the state Constitution. (White registrants merely had to explain this clause: ''All elections shall be by ballot.'')         In Mrs. Hudson's failed attempt to register in 1961, someone slipped a small card to her. It read: ''The Eyes of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan Are Upon You.''         The next year, she dispensed with yet another abstruse constitutional passage, this time under the eyes of Robert F. Kennedy's Justice Department.         The Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed literacy tests and poll taxes. Mrs. Hudson soon signed up 500 new voters.         She became chairwoman of the county chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in 1961 at the urging of her friend Medgar Evers, the N.A.A.C.P. leader who was murdered in 1963. She kept the post for 38 years, fighting and winning battles to stop banks from prejudicial lending practices and bringing phones and paved roads to her poor county.         From inviting civil rights workers to sleep on her floor, to bringing Head Start to the community center she created, Mrs. Hudson achieved much -- but not national fame. Most histories of the civil rights movement do not mention her.         ''Mrs. Hudson was one of the unsung, unheralded heroes of the civil rights movement,'' Vernon E. Jordan Jr., who knew her as director of the Voting Education Project of the Southern Regional Council in the 1960's, said in an interview.         ''Her work represents the essence of what took place,'' he continued. ''There's a lot written about the leaders but not much about the contributions of the Mrs. Hudsons of the world.''         Bob Moses, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee's Mississippi field secretary in the 1960's, talked in an interview about the reign of terror of white supremacists whom he said wanted to eliminate the leadership of the N.A.C.C.P. He called Mrs. Hudson ''a part of that very small network of people who not only survived but actually found ways to struggle.''         He continued, ''It is inconceivable that the movement could have happened the way it did in Mississippi without these people.''         Last year, Mrs. Hudson said in an interview with The Clarion-Ledger in Jackson, Miss., that it had been ''a lonely walk.'' But her fierce, righteous attitude was her armor. This was a woman who wrote her own funeral service.         ''The more they did to us, the meaner we got,'' she said in an interview for John Dittmer's 1994 book, ''Local People: The Struggle for Civil Rights in Mississippi.''         Mrs. Hudson looked the part, not least because she was big. Patricia Derian, who fought for integrated schools in Mississippi as a young mother and was an assistant secretary of state in the Carter administration, said in an interview, ''When she walked in a room, it was a little bit like having a battleship arrive.''         Ms. Derian added, ''When you gave her a hug she was soft, and that was all the soft you got out of her.''         Winson Gates was born in Harmony, in central Mississippi, on Nov. 17, 1916, the 10th of 13 children born to John Wesley Gates and Emma Kirkland, neither of whom ever tried to register to vote.         This family history was reported in the book, ''Mississippi Harmony, Memoirs of a Freedom Fighter'' (Macmillan, 2002), written by Mrs. Hudson and Constance Curry.         Mrs. Hudson was 8 when her mother died, and she and her siblings were raised by her father on a 105-acre farm until the land was seized by a white doctor to whom the family owed money.         A more sinister family memory, mentioned in an oral history by the Southern Regional Council, was her father's mentally ill brother being lynched by a white mob.         In 1936, Winson Gates married Cleo Hudson, whose family owned 500 acres in Harmony, a center of black property owners since Reconstruction. She went to work as a teacher at Harmony School and took on the additional chore of managing the lunchroom. The principal reprimanded her for giving free bread to hungry children.         During periods when her activism made it hard to get a job, she did manual labor. She said she could ''saw as much wood as any man.'' In civil rights work, she said she could do more than a man because a man would be in greater physical danger.         In 1937, Mrs. Hudson and her sister Dovie began a habit of going to the courthouse and trying to register ''for the heck of it,'' she wrote in the book. They conscientiously paid the poll tax, later outlawed, despite not being allowed to vote.         When Northern civil rights activists arrived to join local people in the Freedom Summer of 1964, she let the visitors sleep in her house, even after it was bombed. Her husband told James Chaney, a native of the area who would be killed with Andrew Goodman and Michael Schwerner that summer, not to go to Philadelphia ''because they'd kill you in Neshoba County.''         Mrs. Hudson is survived by her daughter, Annie Maude Horton, of Carthage, Miss.; her brother, Osly Gates of Portland, Ore.; two grandsons and three great-grandchildren.         Her legacy is also marked by Hudson Road, which runs near her house. In 1976, she mobilized the newly powerful black vote to at last pave the streets of Harmony. Before that, paving stopped at the town line.         Correction:  May 12, 2004, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Winson Hudson, a pioneer of the civil rights movement in Mississippi, misstated the year in some copies for the killing of the rights worker James Chaney, who had been warned by her husband against going to Philadelphia, Miss. It was 1964, not 1963.       
         Lygia Pape, an influential Brazilian artist who worked in two important movements, Concretism and the looser Neo-Concretism, and later moved beyond them, died on May 3 in Rio de Janeiro. She was 77.         The cause was complications of myelodysplasia, a blood disease, said her daughter Paula Pape.         A restlessly experimental artist, Ms. Pape (pronounced PAH-pay) worked at challenging formal and conceptual limits in many different media, including painting, printmaking, sculpture, dance, film, performance and installation. In the 1950's she was involved in Concretism, which was based on severe abstract styles of European painters like Piet Mondrian and Kasimir Malevich. In 1954 she helped found an important Concretist group called la Frente (the Front).         At the end of the decade she joined her fellow artists Hélio Oiticica and Lygia Clark in founding Neo-Concretism, which rejected the formal remove of Concretist art but retained its insistence on the concrete reality of the artwork as opposed to more representational imagery.         Favoring more interactive relations between art and viewers, the Neo-Concretists sought to expand the formal, expressive and social dimensions of art. Among Ms. Pape's Neo-Concretist works were books with semiabstract sculptural elements that viewers were encouraged to handle.         In a ballet that Ms. Pape choreographed in 1958, simple geometric shapes with people hidden inside moved about the stage. Ten years later she created one of her best-known pieces, ''Divisor,'' a performance work in which dozens of people poked their heads through holes in a gridded arrangement in a large sheet of white cloth. It has been interpreted as a comment on modern bureaucracy as well as on the split between mind and body.         In the 60's Ms. Pape worked with a filmmaking group called Cinema Novo, for which she designed lettering and posters. She also made short experimental films of her own, some only seconds long. In later decades she created large-scale and often surrealistically dramatic installations using lights, plants, food, flowing liquids, fabric and other materials.         Her work was seen in New York in ''Body and Soul,'' a 400-year survey of Brazilian art at the Guggenheim Museum in 2001. Two works from her Neo-Concretist phase are currently on view at El Museo del Barrio in Manhattan in an exhibition of Latin American works from the collection of the Museum of Modern Art.         Ms. Pape was born on April 7, 1927, in the Novo Friburgo section of Rio. Like many Brazilian artists, she studied studio art informally, but she did receive a master's degree in the philosophy of art from the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1980.         From 1972 to 1985, Ms. Pape taught semiotics at the school of architecture at the Universidade Santa Ursula in Rio. She was appointed professor in the school of fine arts of the Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro in 1983.         In addition to her daughter Paula, Ms. Pape is survived by her husband, Gunther Pape; another daughter, Cristina Maria; and two grandsons.       
         Agnes Cunningham, a founder of the influential folk-song journal Broadside, died on Sunday at a nursing home in New Paltz, N.Y., her daughter Jane Friesen said. She was 95.         Broadside, begun by Ms. Cunningham and her husband, Gordon Friesen, in 1962, published more than 1,000 topical songs during its 26-year run, including some of the first works by Bob Dylan, Phil Ochs, Janis Ian, Buffy Sainte-Marie and Tom Paxton. Though its circulation never reached higher than four figures, it lasted for 187 issues and played a significant role in the development of the 60's folk style.         ''This very small magazine, it reached key people throughout the country,'' Pete Seeger, a frequent contributor, said yesterday. ''When a good song came along, it got picked up right away.''         For the magazine's first issues, Ms. Cunningham, known as Sis, and Mr. Friesen invited musicians from the New York folk scene to their apartment in the Frederick Douglass housing project on West 104th Street in Manhattan to perform their newest songs into a reel-to-reel tape recorder.         They chose songs with strong leftist politics and a direct style, and stated their aims in the first issue with a quotation from Woody Guthrie that ''a good song can only do good.''         ''We favored singers who were simple and didn't have all the fluff,'' Ms. Cunningham said in an interview with The New York Times in 2001. ''Poetry set to music has to be mulled over. I think the more sharply and simply it's written, the better.''         Mr. Dylan's ''Blowin' in the Wind'' was published on the cover of the sixth issue, in May 1962, shortly after the song was written. Malvina Reynolds, whose songs often appeared in Broadside, had ''Little Boxes'' in issue No. 20; ''I Ain't Marching Anymore'' by Mr. Ochs, another frequent contributor, was in issue No. 54.         The couple churned out the early issues using a mimeograph machine once owned by the American Labor Party. Because it was illegal to run a business in their housing project, they smuggled copies out the door in a baby carriage.         As a singer and an accordionist, Ms. Cunningham had played with Mr. Seeger and Mr. Guthrie in the Almanac Singers during the 1940's. At Broadside, she transcribed the chords and lyrics to songs from tape recordings made by musicians. Mr. Friesen, a novelist and journalist, wrote the commentaries.         Songs from the magazine were collected in 2000 on a five-CD boxed set, ''The Best of Broadside, 1962-1988,'' on the Smithsonian Folkways label. The album was nominated for two Grammy Awards, for best historical album and best liner notes.         Born to a poor farming family in Watonga, Okla., Ms. Cunningham graduated from what was then called Southwestern State College in Weatherford, Okla., and married Mr. Friesen, another Oklahoman, in 1941. They came to New York late that year and moved into the communal Almanac House in Greenwich Village with Mr. Seeger, Mr. Guthrie and others. Ms. Cunningham joined the Almanac Singers and performed on their 1942 album, ''Dear Mr. President.''         With Mr. Friesen, who died in 1996, she wrote ''Red Dust and Broadsides: A Joint Autobiography,'' which was published in 1999.         Besides Ms. Friesen, of New Paltz, Ms. Cunningham is survived by another daughter, Agnes Friesen, of Berkeley, Calif.; three grandchildren; and one great-grandson.       
         Emma Buck, who ran a pre-Civil War family farm in Illinois that remained virtually unchanged into the 21st century, died on June 5 on the sleigh bed with handmade ticking she had slept in for 98 years, in the log cabin built by her great-uncle, a German immigrant, in 1849.         She was 100 or 101, said Annie Rieken, a close friend and director of the Heritage Foundation of Monroe County, where the farm is located. The cause of death was breast cancer, Ms. Rieken said.         The 70-acre farm, a sort of rural Smithsonian, was named one of the state's 10 most endangered sites in 1998 by the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois. Miss Buck, who had pulled the last of her own teeth some years ago, lived there without running water, drawing her water from a well. Until two days before she died, she walked to the outhouse, one of many structures on the farm.         It also has a blacksmith's shop, a smokehouse, a butchering shed, a threshing barn and a rare outdoor bake oven.         Miss Buck sharpened scythes on a foot-operated grinding wheel well into her 90's. Speaking with a thick German accent, the slightly persnickety Miss Buck always wore a skirt as she worked.         ''Emma could be blunt and coarse and uncouth by Emily Post standards,'' Ms. Rieken said. ''But there was a total authenticity about her.''         To spend time with Miss Buck was to feel the evocative power of a place that has all but vanished from the American landscape, a fragile holdover where it was possible to encounter wooden butter churns, hobnail boots, copper kettles for making sausage and apple butter and hoops for a Conestoga wagon in the rafters.         ''That was German business,'' she once said speaking of the heavy trough in the smokehouse, used to scald the fur off carcasses, and her other implements. ''What would you do with all these things? Throw them out?''         While contemporaries embraced tractors and other modern machinery, the Buck family stuck to the old ways. The farm was settled by Miss Buck's maternal great-grandparents, Christian and Christina Henke, German immigrants from East Friesland who came by boat from New Orleans and settled in western Illinois, about 35 miles down river from St. Louis, in 1841. As was the custom among German families in the area, Emma and her sister Anna, who died in 1992, worked side by side with their father, Fred, who died in 1966. A brother, Albert, died in 1999. Emma Buck never married and leaves no survivors.         ''The Buck farmstead is a rare glimpse into the past,'' said Mike Jackson, chief architect with the Illinois Historic Preservation Agency. ''It is an extremely well-preserved place, maintained by a woman who lived a 19th-century life throughout the 20th century. Its significance is far greater than its humble origins.''         In 1999, Miss Buck deeded the property to Ahne Road Farms Inc., a nonprofit foundation in nearby Waterloo created with her lawyer, Otto Faulbaum, to preserve the farm as a historic site and interpretive center.         The goal is to inventory the farm's historic buildings and to lay the groundwork for long-term stewardship. ''Farms like Emma's were once common in the Midwest, but everybody else is gone and now the antiques are hanging in some suburban ranch house somewhere,'' Mr. Faulbaum said. ''We would like to restore the whole place as a living history museum and to preserve the farm intact.''         Miss Buck was buried June 6, in the old-fashioned way: by friends and neighbors who lowered her pine coffin into the ground in a corner of the cornfield, the stalks waist high.         She had left clear instructions. ''She said she didn't want an open casket,'' Ms. Rieken said. ''She said, 'If people couldn't visit me alive, they have no business visiting me as a dirty old dead woman.'''         Before covering the coffin, friends threw oranges onto the vault, recalling a story Miss Buck would tell about her grandmother Christina Bode. When German settlers heard there was sickness aboard the ship that brought her from Germany, they rowed into the harbor and tossed oranges onto the deck.         ''Life is like that ship,'' Miss Buck would say. ''Sometimes it blows forward, sometimes back. And just when you think all is lost, someone throws an orange on your deck.''       
         Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross, the psychiatrist whose pioneering work with terminally ill patients helped to revolutionize attitudes toward the care of the dying, died Tuesday at her home in Scottsdale, Ariz. She was 78.         She died after losing consciousness last week, according to her son, Kenneth. She had recently suffered a series of infections. As she neared her own death after debilitating strokes in the late 1990's, Dr. Kübler-Ross appeared to accept it, as she had tried to help so many others to do.         ''I always say that death can be one of the greatest experiences ever,'' she wrote in an autobiography in 1997. ''If you live each day of your life right, then you have nothing to fear.''         Dr. Kübler-Ross was credited with helping end centuries-old taboos in Western culture against openly discussing and studying death. She also helped change the care of many terminally ill patients to make death less psychologically painful, not only for the dying, but also for their doctors and nurses -- and not least for the survivors.         Although the care she sought is by no means universal, she profoundly changed the way the medical profession is asked to look at death. Her greatest influence came through her writings, especially her 1969 best-seller, ''On Death and Dying,'' which remains in print around the world.         She also gave many lectures and distributed tape recordings of them, conducted extensive research into what she described as the five stages of death based on thousands of interviews with patients and health care professionals and did groundbreaking work in counseling dying patients.         She was a powerful intellectual force behind creating a hospice system in the United States through which palliative care and psychological support are provided for many terminally ill people. And she helped to turn thanatology, the study of physical, psychological and social problems associated with dying, into an accepted medical discipline.         ''Dr. Elisabeth Kübler-Ross was a true pioneer in raising the awareness among the physician community and the general public about the important issues surrounding death, dying and bereavement,'' Dr. Percy Wooten said when he was president of the American Medical Association in 1998.         Dr. Wooten said her work was part of the basis for the A.M.A.'s efforts to encourage the medical profession to improve care at the end of life.         The A.M.A was one of her early supporters, though many of its members at first vigorously opposed her.         In the later part of her career, she embarked on research to verify the existence of life after death, conducting, with others, thousands of interviews with people who recounted near-death experiences, particularly of those declared clinically dead by medical authorities but later revived.         Her prestige generated widespread interest and devoted followers.         The work aroused deep skepticism in medical and scientific circles. Her assertions that she had evidence of an afterlife saddened many colleagues, some of whom said she had abandoned rigorous science and had, perhaps, succumbed to her own fears of death.         ''For years, I have been stalked by a bad reputation,'' she wrote in her 1997 autobiography, ''The Wheel of Life: A Memoir of Living and Dying.'' ''Actually, I have been pursued by people who have regarded me as the Death and Dying Lady. They believe that having spent more than three decades in research into death and life after death qualifies me as an expert on the subject. I think they miss the point. The only incontrovertible fact of my work is the importance of life.''         Whatever scientists think about her views of life after death, they continue to be influenced by her methods of caring for the terminally ill. Before ''On Death and Dying,'' terminally ill patients were routinely left to face death in a miasma of loneliness and fear, because doctors, nurses and families were generally ill equipped to deal with death.         Dr. Kübler-Ross changed that for many, though by no means for all, dying people. By the 1980's, the study of dying became part of medical and health-care education in United States. ''Death and Dying'' became an indispensable manual, both for professionals and family members.         Weighing barely two pounds at birth, Elisabeth Kübler was the first of triplets born to Ernst and Emma Villiger Kübler on July 8, 1926, in Zurich.         By the sixth grade, she wanted to be a doctor. But her father angrily opposed the plan, telling her she could resign herself to being his secretary in the office supply business that he managed or spend the rest of her life as a maid.         ''That's all right with me,'' she said she replied.         After her schooling, she volunteered at the largest hospital in Zurich to help refugees from Nazi Germany. When World War II ended, she hitchhiked through nine war-shattered countries, helping open first-aid posts. In Poland, her visit to the Maidanek death camp narrowed her professional goal. She would become a psychiatrist to help people deal with death.         She received her medical degree from the University of Zurich in 1957. Within a year, she moved to the United States; married Dr. Emanuel K. Ross, an American neuropathologist she had met at the university; began her internship at Community Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y.; and become a research fellow at Manhattan State Hospital.         At the hospital, she was appalled by what she called the routine neglect and abuse of dying patients. After badgering her supervisors, she was allowed to develop programs under which to give the patients individual care and counseling.         In 1962, she became a teaching fellow at the University of Colorado School of Medicine in Denver. A small, outwardly shy woman who spoke with a heavy German accent, she was nervous when asked to fill in for a popular professor and master lecturer. At first, she was ignored.         But the hall became noticeably quieter when she brought out a 16-year-old patient who was dying of leukemia and asked the students to interview her. Now it was they who seemed nervous.         When Dr. Kübler-Ross prodded the students, they asked the patient about blood tests, chemotherapy and other clinical questions. Finally, the teenager exploded in anger and began posing her own questions.         What was it like not to be able to dream about the high-school prom? Or going on a date? Or growing up? ''Why won't people tell you the truth?'' she demanded.         When the lecture ended, many students had been moved to tears.         ''Now you're acting like human beings, instead of scientists,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross said.         Her lectures began to draw standing-room-only audiences of medical and theology students, members of the clergy and social workers -- but few doctors.         In 1965, Dr. Kübler-Ross became an assistant professor in psychiatry at the University of Chicago Medical School, where a group of theology students approached her for help in studying death. She suggested a series of conversations with dying patients, who would teach the professionals.         At first, staff doctors objected to the program, arguing that patients should be shielded from thoughts of death. Avoiding the subject entirely, particularly when treating the young, physicians and therapists would meet a dying child's questions with comments like, ''Take your medicine, and you'll get well,'' Dr. Kübler-Ross wrote in ''On Death and Dying,'' which incorporated her account of the Chicago seminars.         She said that children instinctively knew that the answers they received about their prognoses were lies and that the deceit made them feel punished and alone. With an associate, the Rev. Carl Nighswonger, she interviewed dying patients at Billings Memorial, the university's teaching hospital, while the theology students observed from a one-way glass. The terminally ill were eager to talk.         To bring public pressure to change hospital standards, she agreed to a request by Life magazine in 1965 to interview a seminar patient, Eva, who said that her doctors had treated her arrogantly. The Life article angered the hospital administrators, who said the hospital wanted to be famous not for its dying patients, but rather for those it saved. Doctors were ordered not to cooperate further, and the lecture hall for her next seminar was empty.         But the hospital switchboard was overwhelmed with calls in reaction to the article; mail piled up, and Dr. Kübler-Ross was invited to speak at other colleges and universities.         As for Eva, Dr. Kübler-Ross recounted, she ended up dying cold and alone. Gradually, the medical profession moved toward accepting new approaches to treating the terminally ill, although living wills and patient care directives do not always prevent patients from being subjected to neglect or to invasive medical care at the end of life.         From her patient interviews, Dr. Kübler-Ross identified the five now famous stages that many patients go through in confronting their deaths. Often, denial is the first stage. As his condition worsens and denial is impossible, the patient displays anger, the ''Why me?'' stage.         That followed by a bargaining period. ''Yes, I'm going to die, but if I diet and exercise can I do it later?'' When the patient sees that bargaining will not work, depression often sets in.         The final stage is acceptance, a period in which the patient is ready to let go.         Not all dying patients follow the same progression, Dr. Kübler-Ross said, but most experience two or more stages. Moreover, she found, people who are experiencing traumatic life changes like divorces often experience similar stages. Another conclusion she reached was that the acceptance of death came most easily for people who could look back and feel that they had not wasted their lives.         Among the patients whom she interviewed in the late 60's was a woman, Mrs. Schwartz, who had been pronounced dead but hours later was found by a nurse to be alive. Dr. Kübler-Ross said Mrs. Schwartz was able to repeat conversations of others that occurred around her when she was clinically dead, including a joke told by a doctor. Doctors and medical students called the episode a hallucination, but Dr. Kübler-Ross thought it merited further investigation, and she began to an effort to verify existence after death.         At a psychiatric workshop, she was quoted as saying: ''I know for a fact that there is life after death,'' and promptly received a barrage of criticism from scientists. The disapproval, plus what she called institutional politics, caused her to leave hospital work in 1973.         By then, she was receiving requests from around the world to give seminars on death and dying, and she began to speak at workshops for the dying about what she called ''life after life,'' a happy condition in which physical pain and mental anguish are absent.         She and associates talked to thousands of patients like Mrs. Schwartz and said they found common strains in the interviews. Patients reported that their experiences after clinical death were remarkably free of pain; that they were aware of precisely where they were at death and of seeming to float out of their bodies; that they seemed not to be suddenly alone but still with family members or friends; that they felt as if they were guided to a place of psychic energy, light, love and warmth greater than any they knew in life; and that they did not want to return.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross became increasingly interested in spiritual phenomena, she sought her own out-of-body experience. Robert Monroe, an engineer from Virginia who wrote ''Journeys Out of the Body,'' invited her -- at a time when, as it turned out, she was seriously ill with a bowel obstruction -- to participate in experiments with a group of physicians, psychiatrists from the Menninger Foundation and engineers. She lay on a waterbed in a small laboratory, connected with polygraphs and earphones through which she heard tapes of waves, as she was instructed on how to relax.         ''I was on the ceiling,'' she recounted. ''I was so excited that you couldn't believe it. It was really the highlight of my life.''         She repeated the experiment, and she said her illness disappeared.         In her lectures, she began describing more of her out-of-body experiences, some of which she said were at first terrifying but ultimately uplifting. She also talked of encountering spirit guides, including Mrs. Schwartz, who, she said, appeared 10 months after her death and told Dr. Kübler-Ross to continue her work, promising, ''We will help you.''         In the late 70's, Dr. Kübler-Ross built a center on 42 acres in the hills of Escondido, Calif., where she and others could ''expound theories of survival of the spirit after death in the form of a living entity.''         When skeptics challenged her accounts of spirit guides, she said people in the modern age had difficulty accepting them, because they ''are no longer in touch with their own spirituality.''         In 1976, she fell under the sway of Jay Barham, a former Arkansas sharecropper who had founded the Church of the Facet of Divinity and said he was able to channel spirits and communicate with them. Dr. Kübler-Ross talked about setting up a worldwide network of franchised centers with him and his wife to counsel on the problems of dying and living. His program was investigated by the San Diego district attorney's office because of accusations of sexual misbehavior. She severed ties with him, and years later acknowledged that she had been mistaken about him and that he had deceived many people.         Dr. Kübler-Ross's reputation was seriously damaged, and her credibility waned. Moreover, her channeling sessions, combined with a heavy travel schedule, contributed to the breakup of her marriage, and her husband left her in 1979.         Her center in California burned, and the police suspected arson. In 1984, she set up another center, in Virginia, to care for children with AIDS. That center also burned, in 1994, and again arson was suspected. After the second fire, she moved to Scottsdale to be near her son, Kenneth, a freelance photographer.         That year, when Dr. Ross was dying, he moved to a condo in Scottsdale near Dr. Kübler-Ross, and she and Kenneth cared for him. Dr. Kübler-Ross is also survived by a daughter, Barbara Ross Rothweiler, a clinical psychologist, of Wausau, Wis.; and one of her triplet sisters, Eva, of Basel, Switzerland; and two granddaughters.         As Dr. Kübler-Ross's health failed in the late 90's, she acknowledged that she was in pain and ready for her life to end. But she said: ''I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that there is no death the way we understood it. The body dies, but not the soul.''       
         Gloria Emerson, a journalist and author who wrote with angry dignity about the effects of war on Americans, Vietnamese and Palestinians, was found dead by friends and the police yesterday morning in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 75 and left no immediate survivors.         The medical examiner's office said that it had not ruled on the cause of death. Her physician, Karen Brudney, said Ms. Emerson had been suffering from Parkinson's disease, which she feared would leave her unable to write, and she left many notes at the apartment indicating that she had taken her own life.         Both as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times in Vietnam in the early 1970's and later as a writer of nonfiction books and a novel, Ms. Emerson wrote passionately about ordinary people and soldiers ground up by the machinery of war in places like Vietnam, Gaza and Algeria.         War as she wrote about it was not ennobling but debasing, a misery that inflicted physical suffering and psychic damage on civilians, children, and soldiers on both sides. Her literary model was Graham Greene, whose dark portrayal of the early days of the American war in Vietnam influenced her articles and her style. ''Loving Graham Greene'' was the title she gave her novel, published by Random House in 2000.         She was working in the London bureau of The Times in 1969 when, as she wrote in an obituary she left with a covering note that was dated Tuesday, ''Ms. Emerson requested that she be sent to Vietnam because she had been in that country in 1956 and wanted to go back to write about the Vietnamese people and the immense unhappy changes in their lives, not a subject widely covered by the huge press corps who were preoccupied with covering the military story.''         Her articles from Vietnam, many reported with the help of Nguyen Ngoc Luong, her interpreter, brought alive for many readers people who had been an abstraction, the Vietnamese whose ''hearts and minds'' the United States went to war to win, but lost to communist adversaries who prevailed despite millions of casualties.         One of her articles after the unsuccessful South Vietnamese attempt to cut off North Vietnamese supply lines in Laos in 1971 reported how Sergeant Co, an infantry platoon leader, clung to the skids of an American helicopter to get out alive. '''Each helicopter could have been the last one, so what choice was there for me?' he asked. 'Only the madmen would stay and politely wait for the next helicopter.'''         Her literary voice was always gravely serious. In person, she was well dressed, precise in speech and eccentrically funny.         She was constantly giving money to veterans, refugees and street beggars. She could be possessive and domineering, especially toward the photographers whose work she thought would outlast her articles published with them; the words she compared to ice cubes that melted in the sun.         As Ms. Emerson put it in her own obituary: ''Her dispatches from Vietnam won a George Polk Award for excellence in foreign reporting, and, later, a Matrix Award from New York Women in Communications. Her nonfiction book on the war, 'Winners & Losers' (Random House, 1977), won a National Book Award in 1978 but she described it as 'too huge and somewhat messy.' Its subject was the effects of the conflict on some Americans, or 'an absence of the effect,' as she once said.''         Typical of ''Winners & Losers'' were lines like these, about Joseph (Teddy) Humber Jr., who lost both his legs in a mine explosion in Vietnam in 1972 and came home to his family in Westboro, Mass. ''Teddy did not seem to always know what the others were saying,'' she wrote. ''He seemed busy with something else; perhaps it was pain. He sat at the table without moving, often without hearing.''         Another book in 1985, ''Some American Men,'' published by Simon & Schuster, ranged further into the souls of her countrymen and their afflictions in sports and love as well as in war. ''Gaza, a Year in the Intifada,'' about a year she spent with Palestinians in what she called ''an occupied land,'' was published by The Atlantic Monthly Press in 1991.         ''Made to feel inferior, treated with contempt and cruelty, the Gazans struggled to transcend their own feelings of helplessness,'' she wrote then.         ''The book provoked hostility among friends, and others felt it was anti-Israel, but Ms. Emerson insisted this was not the reason for writing it,'' she explained later, in the obituary she left behind. ''She hoped to provide a primer for those who felt the situation in the Middle East was too complicated or too controversial to understand.''         Born in New York City to William B. Emerson and Ruth Shaw Emerson in 1929, she began her career in The Times's women's news department in 1957, describing herself on her application as a widow, giving her married name as Znamiecki.         ''I applied for a job at The New York Times many years ago, and felt correctly that my life depended on it,'' she explained in a note written just before her death. ''I didn't go to college, I ran away from an alcoholic wretched home and went to work on a hotel giveaway magazine.'' She continued, ''Getting a job on the women's page was a gift from heaven although I hated writing about shoes and clothes, all under the eye of the advertising department who measured editorial mention of retailers. You cannot imagine what it was like in those days.''         She left the paper in 1960 to live in Brussels with Charles A. Brofferio, whom she described as ''an ill-suited husband'' she divorced a year later.         The Times hired her back as a reporter in Paris in 1964 ''on the understanding that I would cover the haute couture collections twice a year,'' she explained. Moving to the paper's London bureau in late 1968, she made her way to Belfast to write some articles about the conflict in Northern Ireland, and in 1970, as she put it, ''I was allowed to go to Vietnam because the war was supposed to be over so it didn't matter if a female was sent. Et voilà!''       
         Fay Wray, an actress who appeared in about 100 movies but whose fame is inextricably linked with the hours she spent struggling, helplessly screaming, in the eight-foot hand of King Kong, died on Sunday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 96.         Rick McKay, a director and her friend, said she died peacefully in her sleep. He recalled that Miss Wray's family moved to the United States from Canada in a stagecoach and said that she was possibly the longest-living true star of silent films.         As sound and color came to the movies, Miss Wray remained at the top, but it was the celebrated role that took her to the top of a very tall building that elevated her to cinematic immortality.         The huge success of ''King Kong,'' a beauty-and-the-beast film that opened in New York at both Radio City Music Hall and the Roxy in 1933, led to roles for Miss Wray in other 1930's films in which her life or her virtue, or both, were imperiled. But she was always aware that she would be remembered for the pivotal scene of ''King Kong,'' in which the giant ape carries her to the top of the Empire State Building, gently places her on a ledge, lunges furiously at fighter planes peppering him with bullets and falls to his death.         ''When I'm in New York,'' Miss Wray wrote in The New York Times in 1969, ''I look at the Empire State Building and feel as though it belongs to me, or is it vice versa?''         The most hazardous part of filming ''King Kong,'' Miss Wray recalled, was the tendency of the giant gorilla hand to loosen its grasp while she was suspended high above the set. When she felt she was about to fall, she implored the director, Merian C. Cooper, to have her lowered to the stage floor to rest a few minutes before being secured once again in the hand and sent aloft.         She spent an entire day recording additional screams, variously shrill and plaintive, that an editor later inserted in the soundtrack -- too often, she later emphasized. Asked how she was able to muster such animated cries, she replied, ''I made myself believe that the nearest possible hope of rescue was at least a mile away.''         Over the years, Miss Wray said, she came to feel that Kong had ''become a spiritual thing to many people, including me.''         In a 1987 interview, Miss Wray said she had been sent a script for the 1976 remake of ''King Kong,'' in which Jessica Lange played Kong's co-star, because its producers wanted her to play a small role. She said she disliked the script and declined the offer because ''the film I made was so extraordinary, so full of imagination and special effects, that it will never be equaled.''         Fay Wray was born on Sept. 15, 1907, on a farm in Alberta, a daughter of Jerry Wray, an inventor, and his wife, Vina. Vina Wray and her three daughters moved to Arizona by stagecoach when Fay was 3, and to Lark, Utah, when she was 5. Her father and two brothers had gone ahead.         By the time Fay was 12 or 13, her parents had separated, a sister had died of the flu, and the family was struggling financially. Fay's mother sent her to Los Angeles to live with a friend and pursue a movie career. She appeared in her first film, ''Gasoline Love,'' in 1923. She was an ingénue in a half-dozen silent westerns.         Her breakthrough came when Erich von Stroheim chose her to play the bride in his 1928 silent classic ''The Wedding March.'' Miss Wray was always drawn to writers, as she recounted in her 1989 autobiography, ''On the Other Hand.'' She was just 19 when she married John Monk Saunders, a Rhodes scholar and screenwriter known for films like ''Wings.'' She divorced him, she said, after he injected her with drugs while she slept, sold their house and their furniture and kept the money, and disappeared for a time with their baby daughter, Susan. Saunders hanged himself in 1940.         She was pursued by Sinclair Lewis and had a long romance with Clifford Odets. In 1942 she married Robert Riskin, the Academy Award-winning screenwriter of ''It Happened One Night.'' They had two children, Vicki and Robert Jr. Riskin had a stroke in 1950 and died five years later. In 1971, she married Dr. Sanford Rothenberg, a neurosurgeon who had been one of Riskin's doctors. Dr. Rothenberg died in 1991.         Miss Wray retired in 1942 but made occasional movies in the 1950's and had a leading role in ''Gideon's Trumpet,'' a 1979 film with Henry Fonda. On television, she starred in a situation comedy, ''The Pride of the Family,'' from 1953 to 1955. In later years she also wrote plays that were produced in regional theaters.         Miss Wray is survived by her daughters Susan Riskin of Manhattan and Victoria Riskin of Los Angeles; her son, Robert Riskin Jr., of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.         In 1997, Miss Wray joined Julius Epstein, a writer of the film ''Casablanca,'' to testify to Congress in favor of greater copyright protection for pre-1960's film writers.         Last March Peter Jackson, the director, asked her over dinner if she would appear in his remake of ''King Kong.'' He wanted her to read the summary line, '''Twas beauty killed the beast.''         She thought that might be too confusing, said Mr. McKay, who was host at the dinner.         ''How can someone play me when I'm here?'' she asked.       
         THE ''puppet'' scuttlebutt -- that her latest career move has strings attached and that she's not the person pulling them -- rankles Louise Mirrer. Hence that furrow in the brow of the otherwise self-possessed president of the New-York Historical Society, who is inaugurating her tenure with a $5 million blockbuster exhibition on Alexander Hamilton, a founding father hitherto best known for decorating $10 bills with his somber visage.         According to some historians, Ms. Mirrer is allowing conservative board members to push the society into showcasing national history at the expense of the city's, and kicking it all off with a tribute to Hamilton, a conservative icon. But according to her, Hamilton is underappreciated, and she is getting a bum rap for steering the society from venerable stagnation into 21st-century relevance.         ''For one thing, the people doing the complaining are not the decision-makers at this institution,'' she says, spoiling the hush in her third-floor office. ''The society was too narrowly focused. Really, the new mission is like the old mission. The original mission 200 years ago was to focus in all ways possible on American history first, and then on history in New York State.''         Her books (she was a medievalist in her academic days) are not yet unpacked, but the Oriental carpet and artwork -- including a Klimt-inspired portrait of Ms. Mirrer's ''inner spirit'' by a Dominican artist, Jorge Severino, who painted her as a white-gowned and regal black woman -- lend a rich ambience. ''Maybe it's my ego, but I don't want to preside over an institution that puts on exhibitions that have limited popular appeal,'' she says. ''If there's a small exhibit that has merit, fine, do it somewhere, but not on Central Park West! I personally would not want to see this institution become an inconsequential institution.''         Next up after Hamilton, she's mounting another blockbuster, ''From Bondage to Freedom,'' a $2 million overhauled version of the society's original $50,000 exhibition on slavery, which did not, in her opinion, make enough of an impression. No pizzazz. No revelatory narrative.         Next February she has planned an Audubon exhibition for birders, and others, to die for: taxidermy, artwork, avian surround-sound. Then there's a First Ladies exhibition that will -- listen up, critics of Ms. Mirrer's ''big picture'' machinations -- be New York City-centric. Her board, she admits, smiled benevolently about the Audubon show and has not yet signed off on First Ladies. But she is confident they will. ''This is not a fractured board,'' she notes, a touch defensively.         With full panache intact at 51 -- her black skirt is short, her patent heels are high, her blue Hermès scarf is, like that 600-pound granite gargoyle on a corner pedestal, a gift from colleagues at the City University of New York, where she was executive vice chancellor -- Ms. Mirrer is an avowed fan of blockbusters on a national scale. This is no time, she says, for the society to do the museum equivalent of contemplating its navel, or the city's, though the focus on the latter was an inarguable strength of her predecessor, Kenneth T. Jackson, a Columbia University historian.         But she is adamant that the society is not compromising its integrity by supporting a blockbuster-friendly agenda endorsed by two deep-pocketed additions to its board, Richard Gilder and Lewis E. Lehrman, both Republicans. And she insists that the loan to the society of historic documents owned by Mr. Lehrman and Mr. Gilder -- a co-chairman of the search committee that recruited her -- has not unduly influenced curatorial decisions. Sure, she wants their documents at her institution, especially after $1 million was spent on a vault for them. But the entire board, she says, endorsed the Hamilton exhibit: the proof is the $5 million raised for it since her arrival in June.         THE exhibition will sponsor a few private receptions during the Republican National Convention before opening to the public, but Ms. Mirrer denies that the society's agenda is partisan: ''I don't see this as a place that nurtures one view of history at the expense of another,'' she says. Translation: Mr. Gilder is not controlling policy.         Besides, Ms. Mirrer, unlike her benefactor, is a Democrat. ''I don't think he even knows,'' she says.         She grew up in Great Neck, on Long Island, where her father was an internist and her mother a historian and educator. Even her grandmother was a college graduate. Ms. Mirrer was a pre-med major at the University of Pennsylvania until a curriculum requirement -- a history course -- changed her trajectory. On her mother's advice, she opted for a medieval history course, then switched academic gears. She received a linguistics degree from Cambridge and a doctorate at Stanford and came to CUNY, where she supervised a revamping of the admissions policy, from the University of Minnesota. Her second marriage, to the University of California, Los Angeles, sociologist, David Halle, is on commuter terms: neither wished to become ''a faculty spouse.''         She lives on Beekman Place with two of her three children -- both attend public schools -- and, despite seeing her husband only on weekends, makes time for Saturday-morning tennis with another female executive, Kathryn Wylde, who heads the Partnership for New York City.         So they're doubles partners? Ms. Mirrer frowns. ''Singles; we're way too competitive for doubles.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Susan Mary Alsop, who proclaimed that she saw ''no future in being an ordinary person'' and became a celebrated political hostess and later an author, died on Wednesday at her home in the Georgetown neighborhood of Washington. She was 86.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, Anne Milliken, her daughter, said.         At 1:46 a.m. on Jan. 21, 1961, John F. Kennedy, after attending his five inaugural balls, showed up, supposedly unannounced, at the doorstep of the Georgetown house then belonging to Mrs. Alsop and her husband, Joseph, the political columnist. Mr. Kennedy stayed 90 minutes and enjoyed some soup and Champagne.         For the next few years, Mrs. Alsop said, she felt she had to have her hair done all the time, ''just in case I'd be asked to the White House.''         The glitter of Mrs. Alsop's social whirl sometimes masked the serious business it facilitated. During the Cuban missile crisis in October 1962, President Kennedy dined at her house with two Soviet experts, the diplomat Charles Bohlen and the philosopher Isaiah Berlin, whose insights helped to inform his judgments in his showdown with Moscow.         Mrs. Alsop was a direct descendant of John Jay, the first chief justice of the United States, and Mr. Alsop called the couple's crowd ''the ever-diminishing group of survivors of the WASP ascendancy.''         Her life sparkled with acquaintances like Churchill and Garbo, and the great Paris designers, including Christian Dior, gave her their latest couture when she was a slim Parisian socialite. As a teenager, she was thrilled to be invited to tea with Edith Wharton, only to find her boring.         At 56, Mrs. Alsop began a writing career, specializing in popular history. One of her four books, ''The Congress Dances: Vienna 1814-1815,'' captured enough spice from that epochal meeting of Europe's leaders that several reviewers said it gave new meaning to affairs of state.         ''It is as if Alsop had attended the festivities herself, and then, returning at dawn, recounted each and every detail so as not to lose a crumb,'' Prince Michael of Greece wrote in a review in The Washington Post.         Susan Mary Jay, the daughter of a diplomat, was born in Rome on June 19, 1918, and grew up in South America, Europe, Washington and New York. She graduated from the Foxcraft School and attended Barnard College.         In 1939, she began working at Vogue as a receptionist, writer and model. She married William S. Patten, who, like her father, was a diplomat. In 1941, they moved to Washington. Her husband's friend Franklin Roosevelt Jr. invited them to supper with his parents at the White House. She said the president shook dry martinis, ''which I adored,'' and served fresh caviar sent by Stalin.         The Pattens then lived in Paris, socializing with people like the Rothschilds, Cecil Beaton and Ho Chi Minh. Mr. Patten died in 1960, and the next year, she married Mr. Alsop, who had been Mr. Patten's roommate at Harvard. She and Mr. Alsop were divorced in 1978, but remained friends and played host at each other's parties. He died in 1989.         Mrs. Alsop is survived by her daughter, who lives in Salt Lake City; her son, Bill Patten, of Worcester, Mass.; seven grandchildren; and a great-grandson.         Lucy Moorhead in her 1979 book, ''Entertaining in Washington,'' called Mrs. Alsop ''glue,'' because she listened intently to loquacious bigwigs, often a key to a good dinner party.         Mrs. Alsop herself suggested that successful Washington get-togethers involve a chimerical brew of power, showmanship and timing.''If you're fortunate enough to get the secretary of state and the head of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the night of an international crisis ,'' she mused in an interview with The Post in 1987. ''It sounds ghoulish, but it's something you want to have.''       
         Françoise Sagan, the rebellious French writer who achieved fame as a teenager with her first novel, ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' a precocious tale of sexual disillusionment, but whose international reputation dimmed as literary tastes changed, died yesterday in Honfleur, in northern France. She was 69.         The cause was a blood clot in a lung, friends of her family told Agence France-Presse. She had been in poor health for several years.         Ms. Sagan had an enormous international success with ''Bonjour Tristesse,'' about an amoral teenager who sets out to keep her philandering widowed father from marrying again. The novel was originally published in France in 1954. The following year an English translation reached No. 1 on the New York Times best-seller list. Ms. Sagan was only 19, making her the youngest author to achieve that feat at the time.         By early 1958, the book had sold 810,000 copies in France and more than a million in the United States and had been translated into 20 languages.         Serge Gavronsky, a professor of French literature at Barnard College, said in a 1995 interview that Ms. Sagan's early novels expressed the rebelliousness and cynicism of many of her peers in the French bourgeoisie. Those books, he said, ''were perfectly in accord with a moment of time'' -- the mid-1950's -- and ''well connected'' with France's literary past.         John Updike, writing in The New Yorker 20 years after ''Bonjour Tristesse'' appeared, praised ''its sparkling sea and secluding woods, its animal quickness, its academically efficient plot, its heroes and heroines given the perfection of Racine personae by the young author's innocent belief in glamour.''         Later works by Ms. Sagan appeared repeatedly on best-seller lists in France, and she went on to write more than a score of books, as well as plays, film scripts, short stories and song lyrics. Some of her novels were turned into movies -- ''Bonjour Tristesse'' and ''A Certain Smile'' in 1958 -- and she directed the 1977 French film ''Les Fougères Bleues.''         ''Les Auteurs de la Littérature Française,'' a standard French work for students, described Ms. Sagan's terrain as somewhat limited: ''a worldly, rich, idle, luxurious universe; some characters who live without material cares, who drink, who love themselves without conviction. A taste for the unfinished, for biting analysis, for narcissism. Sagan has forever been recounting the rotting of a generation.''         Roger Shattuck, a cultural historian and professor of French at Boston University, said in 1995 that Ms. Sagan's reputation ''had declined considerably after her first half-dozen novels'' because she wrote too much and repeated herself and because of changing literary fashions.         Ms. Sagan's view of herself and her life was sometimes harsh. In ''Et Toute Ma Sympathie,'' a 1993 book made up largely of reflections, she included a poem in which she called herself ''this bizarre woman, childish and messed up.''         In the first flush of Ms. Sagan's fame, she became known for drinking until dawn and gambling lavishly. It has been reported that she once made a killing at the gaming tables of Deauville and then turned around and used the money to buy herself a turn-of-the-century chateau.         She also praised the joys of driving sports cars. ''Whoever has not thrilled to speed has not thrilled to life,'' she wrote in ''With Fondest Regards'' (1985). ''However madly and hopelessly in love you may be, at 120 miles an hour you are less so. Your blood no longer congeals around your heart; your blood throbs to the extremities of your body, to your fingertips, your toes and your eyelids, now the fateful and tireless guardians of your own life.''         She suffered a skull fracture and other injuries in 1957 when her Aston-Martin overturned while she was living in Milly, a resort town in northern France.         Ms. Sagan was convicted twice of narcotics offenses, in 1990 and 1995, receiving fines and prison sentences, which were suspended.         She once told an investigating magistrate: ''I believe I have a right to destroy myself as long as it does not harm anyone. If I feel like swallowing a glass of caustic soda, that's my own problem.''In 2002 she was also convicted of tax fraud in a case involving payments she received in the early 1990's to intercede with François Mitterrand, a friend and then the president of France, in an oil deal. Her health prevented her from appearing in court.         Ms. Sagan was born on June 21, 1935, in Cajarc, a village in southwest France. She was the third and youngest child of Paul Quoirez, a well-to-do businessman, and his wife, Marie.         Françoise Quoirez, nicknamed Kiki, grew up largely in Lyons and on an estate in the Vercors region in the southeast. When she was 15, her family moved to Paris. She attended convent schools before an unsuccessful academic experience at the Sorbonne.         She took the pen name Sagan because she liked the way it sounded. The name also harked back to the Prince and Princesse de Sagan, 19th-century Parisians on whom Marcel Proust is said to have based some of his characters.         After two years at the Sorbonne, with much time spent in cafes and little studying, she failed crucial year-end examinations in June 1953, angering her family. She felt she ''had to do something'' to placate them, she would recall, so she sat down and wrote ''Bonjour Tristesse'' in August. She had already been thinking about the novel and making notes for it for some months.         The book begins with what has come to be seen as a vintage Sagan sentence: ''A strange melancholy pervades me, to which I hesitate to give the grave and beautiful name of sorrow.''         In ''With Fondest Regards,'' Ms. Sagan, noting that ''Bonjour Tristesse'' enjoyed a ''succès de scandale'' when it first came out in France, said that in those days she could not understand what all the fuss was about.         Looking back three decades later, she said the furor resulted partly from the relationship between the heroine, Cécile, and her boyfriend.         ''It was inconceivable,'' she wrote, ''that a young girl of 17 or 18 should make love without being in love with a boy of her own age, and not be punished for it.''         Furthermore, she added, people couldn't accept that this girl ''should know about her father's love affairs, discuss them with him, and thereby reach a kind of complicity with him on subjects that had until then been taboo between parents and children.''         Ms. Sagan continued to weave fiction from sentences that were a bit abstract in the French way but that at their best dealt trenchantly and economically with the emotions.         Her other novels published in translation in the United States include ''A Certain Smile'' (1956), ''Those Without Shadows'' (1957), ''Aimez-Vous Brahms?'' (1960), ''Wonderful Clouds'' (1962), ''La Chamade'' (1966), ''The Heart-Keeper'' (1968), ''A Few Hours of Sunlight'' (1971), ''The Painted Lady'' (1983), ''Incidental Music'' and ''Salad Days'' (1984).         Writing in The New York Times Book Review in 1983, Nora Johnson praised ''the grace and freshness of her early novels, those slender tales of love between aged children and middle-aged burnouts that seemed so remarkable when they began appearing in the 50's,'' observing that Ms. Sagan ''seemed to know everything then.''         Ms. Sagan won the Prix des Critiques in 1954 for ''Bonjour Tristesse'' and the Prix de Monaco 30 years later for her work as a whole.         Her 1958 marriage to Guy Schoeller, a publisher, ended in divorce in 1960. Her 1962 marriage to Robert James Westhoff, an American ceramicist and sculptor, ended in divorce in 1963.         Her survivors include a son, Denis, from her marriage to Mr. Westhoff.         Ms. Sagan's views on romance could be somber. In a 1980 interview, she said: ''I think love is like an illness, an intoxication. Sometimes I've been intoxicated for three or four years, but never more. I think that people can be happy together for longer than I used to believe, but I still don't think it can be forever.''         In a 1993 interview before her second drug trial, Ms. Sagan recalled: ''I had incredible luck because just when I grew up, the pill came along. When I was 18, I used to die with fear of being pregnant, but then it arrived, and love was free and without consequence for nearly 30 years. Then AIDS came. Those 30 years coincided with my adulthood, the age for having fun.''       
         Dr. Katharina Dalton, a British gynecologist who did early work establishing a link between fluctuations in the menstrual cycle and changes in behavior and who advocated using progesterone to treat premenstrual syndrome, died on Sept. 17 in Britain, The Associated Press reported. She was 87.         Beginning in the early 1950's, Dr. Dalton led pioneering studies of premenstrual syndrome, challenging the widely accepted view that the condition was a figment of the imagination. She led one of the first clinics to specifically treat the symptoms, at University College Hospital in London.         She is largely credited with developing the use of menstrual charts for the diagnosis of the disorder, and argued that the timing of PMS in women was associated with higher rates of suicide attempts, alcohol abuse and violent crimes.         ''Many people did not believe it was a real entity,'' said Dr. Mona Shangold, a former assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. ''She really brought it into the public eye, and eventually it became an accepted disorder for which we now have good treatments.''         PMS, Dr. Dalton argued, was brought on primarily by deficiencies of progesterone and could be alleviated with hormone therapy. She also believed that the hormone could be used to ease postnatal depression. But today most experts disagree with those findings and instead rely on selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or S.S.R.I.'s, and other medications for the treatment of PMS.         ''None of the rest of us have found progesterone as helpful as the data Dr. Dalton presented, but she really was quite influential in the modern understanding of what happens to women premenstrually,'' said Dr. Diana Dell, an OB-GYN and psychiatrist at the Duke University Medical Center.         Born in 1916 in London, Katharina Kuipers Dalton began her career as a podiatrist after studying at the London Foot Hospital. After her first husband died during World War II, she decided to switch careers and earned a medical degree at the Royal Free Hospital.         In later work, Dr. Dalton helped demonstrate that depression and other disorders could be aggravated by PMS, particularly around the last few days of the menstrual cycle or the first days of menstruation. While many experts today agree that PMS can exacerbate certain conditions and influence behavior, some of Dr. Dalton's assertions remain controversial. In several court cases in the 1980's, for example, she testified in defense of women who blamed severe PMS for their criminal offenses.         Several of Dr. Dalton's books, including ''Once a Month,'' published in the late 70's, became best sellers.         Dr. Dalton is survived by four children and five grandchildren, according to The Independent, a British daily.       
         Nuha al-Radi, the Iraqi artist and diarist whose work depicted her country's tribulations with a wry, impish wit, has died in Beirut. She was 63.         Ms. Radi died on Aug. 30, of pneumonia, her immune system severely weakened as a result of treatment for leukemia, said her sister, Selma al-Radi, speaking by telephone from the Lebanese capital.         Although both a ceramist and a painter, Ms. Radi was best known for her book ''Baghdad Diaries,'' a vivid account of the texture of daily life during the first gulf war and its aftermath, when she found shelter from the bombing in the family orchard in a well-to-do neighborhood.         ''The birds have taken the worst beating of all,'' she wrote. ''They have sensitive souls, which cannot take all this hideous noise and vibration. All the caged lovebirds have died from the shock of the blasts, while birds in the wild fly upside down and do crazy somersaults. Hundreds, if not thousands, have died in the orchard. Lonely survivors fly about in a distracted fashion.''         After the book was reissued last year in the wake of the second gulf war, Michiko Kakutani wrote in a review in The New York Times that ''the opening sections of these diaries give the reader a tactile and highly personal sense of how the allied bombing of Baghdad in 1991 affected ordinary Iraqi civilians. These descriptions can be read as a harbinger, in some respects, of residents' efforts to cope with the recent war and the continuing postwar upheaval.''         While not overtly political, Ms. Radi had no love for either the government controlling Iraq or for the United States for repeatedly causing destruction in Baghdad, her native city.         The book brims with criticism of the United States for making Iraqi civilians bear the brunt of the violence in their efforts to overthrow Saddam Hussein, while depicting the grim resignation and black humor Iraqis used to survive under his violent rule.         She relates in matter-of-fact detail how a friend's nanny working in one of the presidential palaces told about what happens to thieves:         ''She said that when someone was caught stealing, they gathered the staff together, brought in a doctor, who chopped off this guy's hand, and immediately dunked it into boiling oil to cauterize it.''         The work also included jokes like the one about Mr. Hussein asking his cabinet members what time it is, with them responding in unison, ''Whatever time you want, sir.''         After her book's publication Ms. Radi, uncertain of the reaction from the government, chose to live in exile in Beirut, following something of a family tradition. She was born in 1941 in Baghdad. Her father was an Iraqi diplomat who served as the country's ambassador to Iran and India until the monarchy was overthrown in 1958.         The family later moved to Beirut, where her survivors still live periodically. They include her mother, Suad Munir Abbas; a brother, Abbad, of Abu Dhabi and Toronto, and her sister, Selma, a renowned archaeologist who has done extensive work on preserving historic buildings in Yemen.         In the late 1950's and early 1960's, Ms. Radi studied pottery at the Byam Shaw School of Art in London before moving to Beirut and teaching for a short period at the American University there. With the outbreak of the civil war in Lebanon, she returned to Baghdad, where her work included several government commissions for large ceramic tableaus.         Ms. Radi used to joke that even the attempt to see her work was a perfect reflection of the turmoil in her country: one massive piece showing a magic carpet flight from ''1,001 Nights'' hung on a government building facing the Iranian Embassy while the other graced a presidential palace and was therefore off limits.         Taking visitors around the Iraqi capital in 1989 in the immediate aftermath of the Iran-Iraq war, she would nod toward the work near the embassy and tell them not to point and not to take pictures and that stopping to look was certainly out of the question.         Her work often combined a certain whimsy with the darker aspects of life in the Middle East. One exhibition, titled ''Embargo Art,'' held in Amman during the late 1990's, a period of Western sanctions against Iraq, consisted of ''found objects'' like old mufflers from cars, the kind of things Iraqis had to use to get by, she said.         Ms. Radi was especially trenchant in describing the growing divide between the West and the Arab world, one to which she was particularly attuned, given her ease at working in both cultures.         In her diary, she tells of an encounter in Baghdad during which a woman wishes that some great catastrophe would ''envelop the U.S. and swallow the whole continent.'' When someone else in the conversation protests that his brothers living there would perish, the woman responds, ''They can go down with it.''         Last year, weeks after Mr. Hussein was overthrown, Ms. Radi went back to Baghdad to spend several weeks with her mother, who had refused to leave, comparing herself to Scarlett O'Hara after having survived so many wars in Iraq.         Ms. Radi, who usually managed to find a flower to tuck behind her ear every day no matter what war-ravaged city she was in, scampered through the wreckage of Mr. Hussein's compound and found happily that much of her large ceramic tableau of Iraq had survived the bombing unscathed.         She was somewhat less than enchanted with Iraq's latest overseers for failing to provide basic security and services, however, describing the new tenants of the presidential compound in an interview with The Times last year in her typically caustically droll manner:         ''America is in its ivory tower palace,'' she said, ''We are used to having coups and revolutions. But usually people who stage them take over the country afterward.''       
         Bernice Rubens, a prolific British novelist who drew on her Jewish upbringing and ill-fated marriage to tell stories of vice and grimness with warmth and even humor, died on Oct. 13 in London, British newspapers reported. She was 76.         Ms. Rubens won Britain's prestigious Booker Prize for fiction in 1970 for ''The Elected Member,'' the story of a Jewish family whose secrets drive one son insane.         ''Madame Sousatzka,'' her 1962 novel about the tenuous bond between an eccentric piano teacher and a child prodigy, was adapted in 1988 into a film with Shirley MacLaine in the title role.         Ms. Rubens wrote the first of her 25 books when she was 35, to cope with what she later described to The New York Times as ''the kind of despair that any intelligent woman has today.'' She said she thought of writing as therapy.         The daughter of Orthodox Jews, and the lone non-musician among gifted siblings, Ms. Rubens made family relationships and expectations frequent themes in her stories, placing familiar characters in peculiar circumstances.         In ''Spring Sonata'' (1979), a fetus decides against being born after listening to its parents' high expectations, while ''Brothers'' (1983) follows four generations of a Jewish family that flees Russia for Europe, as Ms. Rubens's father did.         In 1966, while still married to her husband, she wrote a thinly veiled account of his infidelity in ''Mate in Three.'' They divorced a few years later.         Bernice Ruth Rubens was born in Cardiff, Wales, on July 26, 1928, and studied English literature at Cardiff University, graduating in 1948 and then teaching in Birmingham, England.         She started writing after her two daughters entered nursery school. At roughly the same time, she began creating documentary films with humanitarian themes, often focusing on people with disabilities. She traveled to Asia and Africa to document the role of women in rural development.         She was writing her memoirs when she died.         She is survived by two daughters, Sharon and Rebecca.       
         Betty Hill, whose assertion that she was carried off by otherworldly beings in 1961 inspired a national obsession with alien abduction that remains a staple of American popular culture, died on Sunday at her home in Portsmouth, N.H. She was 85.         The cause was lung cancer, her niece Kathleen Marden said.         Mrs. Hill was not the first person to tell of an alien encounter. But her account was the first to capture the public imagination on a grand scale, defining a narrative subgenre that has flourished in the decades since.         Mrs. Hill's account was the subject of a book by John G. Fuller, ''The Interrupted Journey: Two Lost Hours 'Aboard a Flying Saucer''' (Dial, 1966). In 1975 it became a television movie, ''The UFO Incident.'' The film starred Estelle Parsons as Mrs. Hill and James Earl Jones as her husband, Barney, who also said he was abducted.         The incident, the Hills said, occurred on the night of Sept. 19, 1961. Driving in the White Mountains of New Hampshire, they saw a light that seemed to grow larger and larger. Back home, they found what appeared to be shiny spots on the car's exterior. They could not account for a two-hour segment of their trip.         The Hills later saw a psychiatrist, who put them under hypnosis. Gradually, a narrative of the couple's lost hours emerged. They recounted many times that a group of short gray-skinned beings stopped their car and took them aboard a waiting spaceship. There, the Hills said, they were subjected to rigorous medical examinations that included inserting a long needle into Mrs. Hill's navel.         The account fit squarely in the Western narrative tradition. With a dark night, ghostly apparitions and sexual undercurrent, it had many Victorian gothic hallmarks, and it shared the common Western folklore theme of being spirited off and ravished by an otherworldly creature.         In the Hills' account, these traditional elements were transplanted to a modern but no less anxious time, the height of the cold war, when many people gazed nervously skyward.         ''It's not unlike the Leda and the swan myth,'' said Terry Matheson, a professor of English at the University of Saskatchewan and the author of ''Alien Abductions: Creating a Modern Phenomenon'' (Prometheus, 1998). ''The alien comes in, probes women in a distinctly sexual way for purposes that are equally inscrutable, but which may, we're told, make sense down the road.''         Mrs. Hill was born Eunice Elizabeth Barrett on June 28, 1919, in Newton, N.H. A graduate of the University of New Hampshire, she was a social worker for many years. Besides her niece, survivors include three sisters, two children and three grandchildren. Mr. Hill died in 1969.         The Hills' cultural legacy includes films (''Close Encounters of the Third Kind''), television programs (''Roswell'') and books, like those by Whitley Strieber and John Mack, that treat alien abduction as a plausible phenomenon.       
         Terry Dintenfass, a longtime New York art dealer whose gallery brought together several currents from outside the mainstream of 20th-century art, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         Her death was reported by her son Andrew Dintenfass.         For nearly 40 years the Terry Dintenfass gallery swam mostly against the tide of the rest of the art world. In the era of Pop and Minimal Art, Ms. Dintenfass was drawn to politically aware figurative painting rooted in the Social Realism of the 1930's.         She also represented the estates of first-generation American modernists like Arthur Dove and Charles Sheeler, as well as that of Ben Shahn.         At a time when nearly all artists showing in New York galleries were white, she represented several black artists, most notably Jacob Lawrence, but also Raymond Saunders, Richard Hunt and Walter Williams, a little-known painter whose work she showed in her first gallery, which was in Atlantic City.         She also represented the estate of Horace Pippin, a black folk artist, and worked on an important traveling exhibition of his work in 1977 that was organized by the Phillips Collection in Washington.         And, even though the line separating high and low culture was fairly firm, she also exhibited artists with a strong illustrational bent, like Ronald Markman, Richard Merkin and Robert Andrew Parker, as well as Edward Koren, a cartoonist for The New Yorker.         Ms. Dintenfass's life was an unusual mixture of propriety, activism and bohemianism. Born Theresa Kline on Easter in 1920, she grew up in Atlantic City, where her family owned a small department store.         She and her brother, Nathan S. Kline (author of ''From Sad to Glad,'' about depression), lived in a house full of art, books and music, with parents who wanted their children to be aware of people different from themselves.         Ms. Dintenfass attended finishing school in Virginia and studied art on and off for years, mostly at the Pennsylvania Academy of Art in Philadelphia. In 1938 she married a surgeon, Arthur Dintenfass, and had three children; after World War II they settled in Atlantic City, where she ran her husband's medical office for several years.         Using a small trust fund, Ms. Dintenfass began buying one painting every year, often from the Whitney Museum of American Art's annual exhibitions of painting and sculpture.         Her first galleries, called D Contemporary Gallery, were in Atlantic City hotels. She showed work on consignment from prominent New York dealers, and became especially close to Edith Gregor Halpert, whose Downtown Gallery represented several artists from the Alfred Stieglitz circle. She also sold the work of Milton Avery.         In 1959 she opened a gallery in a garden apartment at 18 East 67th Street in Manhattan, where she also lived for several years. In 1975 she moved her gallery to a large space in Manhattan, at 50 West 57th Street, and retired in 1999. Her business is now run by her son Andrew.         Ms. Dintenfass's first marriage and a brief second one ended in divorce. In 1976 she married James M. Reed, a career diplomat who also worked for the American Friends Service Committee. Mr. Reed died in 1985. In addition to Andrew, of Pacific Palisades, Calif., Ms. Dintenfass is survived by two other children from her first marriage, Dr. John Dintenfass of Manhattan and Susan Subtle Dintenfass of Berkeley, Calif.; and three grandchildren.       
         JOYCE ACCIAIOLI RUDGE is happy to be off her feet. ''It's so good to sit down; man, it's the best,'' she says, relishing the downtime from a morning that began with 70 e-mail messages from Italy. Her legs are tucked underneath her on a wooden bench in Federal Hall National Memorial, the Greek Revival landmark on Wall Street. The hall is now transformed into the downtown branch of the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, with 21 portraits of the powerful Medici family dating to the 16th and 17th centuries.         Ms. Rudge is the organizer behind the Splendor of Florence, a cultural festival that is being staged throughout Lower Manhattan through Sunday, with tastings of Tuscan food, concerts and Florentine artisan craft shops in the glass-domed Winter Garden of the World Financial Center, and the Medici exhibition on Wall Street. She convinced the Uffizi to lend the Medici paintings for display until Nov. 12.         How did she manage to pull this off? ''It's all about networking; that's the key,'' says Ms. Rudge, who is 57 and a former fashion model. ''It's about people trusting that you are going to deliver what you say you're going to deliver.''         In the case of the Medici art, she says, the director of the Uffizi and Italian officials took a fancy to her pitch that the festival would bring together Florence's best artisans, many of them making the same beautiful products, including lace and jewelry, that are prominent in the Uffizi paintings hanging in Federal Hall.         ''They took an interest in the theme,'' Ms. Rudge says. ''They love their city, their artisans, and the idea of being able to help artisans who are under threat of extinction because everything is so manufactured these days.''         So who is Ms. Rudge, this delicate-boned beauty with smoky brown eyes and soaring cheekbones? Here's what we know. She was a hometown girl from Providence, R.I., who made good as a fashion model in Milan and Paris in the 1970's and early 1980's, gracing the covers of European Vogue and Cosmopolitan. She organized the first Splendor of Florence in Providence in 1999 as a tribute to her grandfathers, Italian artisans who came to America in the early 1900's. She repeated the festival in Philadelphia in 2001.         She seems to have a knack for organizing things, even rather splashy projects about which she knows very little. She has sailed only twice in her life, yet she handled the logistics for the Italian entry in the 1983 America's Cup race, getting loads of good press in Italy as the Italian sailors regaled the locals in Newport, R.I., with pasta dinners and danced into the night.         ''It established me as a person who could pull rabbits out of hats for Italian companies,'' says Ms. Rudge, elegantly dressed in a taupe-colored pantsuit, her shoulders covered in a striped Kenzo shawl.         In 1995, Ms. Rudge organized her first event in Lower Manhattan, an exhibition about engines of the Renaissance period called ''Mechanical Marvels: Invention in the Age of Leonardo.'' Sponsored by the Italian aeronautics company Finmeccanica, the event was also held in the Winter Garden. That is where she met the mayor of Florence and told him of her idea to celebrate Florentine artisans. Her grandparents are from Molise, a region southeast of Rome, but she says her ancestors are from Florence.         Ms. Rudge is found at the bottom of the grand marble staircase in the Winter Garden. She leans into her cellphone, chatting incessantly, alternating between Italian and English. She says she gets a kick out of working under pressure. She thrives on stress.         ''I could never do something at the same pace, every day,'' she says in a low, husky voice. ''I need to have these moments of high stress, high anxiety, an impossible schedule, then downtime. It's almost like climbing a mountain. Mind you, this is a very big mountain.''         AND what a climb it is. Ms. Rudge is on her cellphone, trying to find black cabbage for Tuscan chefs who consider it an absolute must for a thick peasant soup to be served in the Grill Room at the World Financial Center. Then she is on to another crisis: a Florentine artisan is toting around two suitcases of antique gold jewelry, too afraid to part with it. Ms. Rudge contemplates getting a Brink's armored truck to stash the gold. In the end, the most expensive gold is returned to Florence.         ''To do this job, you just have to be resourceful,'' she says. ''You don't need a degree.''         Ms. Rudge doesn't have a college degree. So does she have a bit of a complex about that?         ''I think you tend to overcompensate,'' she says. ''I've spent my life researching things.''         She moved to Italy at age 19 to discover her roots. Much to the dismay of her parents -- her father was a furniture maker, while her mother made costume jewelry -- she stayed in Europe to pursue a modeling career. She has been married for 15 years to Peter Rudge, an English-born music entrepreneur who managed the Rolling Stones and the Who, among others, in the 1970's. They have a home in London.         For the last couple of years, Ms. Rudge has been living in a hotel suite in Battery Park City, flitting between New York and Florence. She is now looking for a permanent home here. She wants to see the Splendor of Florence be an event every two years in downtown Manhattan.         ''I like solving problems, so I'm certainly having a field day here,'' she says, laughing.         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Iris Chang, a journalist whose best-selling book, ''The Rape of Nanking,'' a chronicle of the atrocities committed in that city by occupying Japanese forces, helped break a six-decade-long international silence on the subject, committed suicide on Tuesday near Los Gatos, Calif. She was 36 and lived in San Jose.         Ms. Chang's literary agent, Susan Rabiner, announced the death.         Ms. Chang was found in her car on a rural road south of Los Gatos, dead from an apparently self-inflicted gunshot wound, the local authorities told The San Francisco Chronicle. She had left a suicide note at home that she had painstakingly written, edited and rewritten, her husband, Brett Douglas said in a telephone interview yesterday.         ''The Rape of Nanking: The Forgotten Holocaust of World War II'' was published by Basic Books in 1997, the 60th anniversary of the massacre. The book documented the events in Nanking (now Nanjing) during the second Sino-Japanese War, in the years leading up to World War II.         In December 1937 Japanese troops entered the city, which until shortly before the invasion had been the Chinese capital. In less than two months they murdered more than 300,000 civilians and raped more than 80,000 women. Ms. Chang's book was the first full-length nonfiction account of the event.         Reviewing ''The Rape of Nanking'' in The New York Times Book Review, Orville Schell called it an ''important new book,'' adding that Ms. Chang ''recounts the grisly massacre with understandable outrage.''         She had a keen personal interest in the subject. Ms. Chang's grandparents had fled Nanking just before the occupation, eventually settling in the United States. Growing up in the Midwest, she heard family stories of the massacre, but as an adult she was unable to find much about it in print. In China and Japan, and even in the West, the subject had been almost completely lost to history.         ''The whole issue had scar tissue growing over it, but it had never really healed,'' Mr. Schell, the dean of the Graduate School of Journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and a longtime observer of China, said in a telephone interview. ''She sort of threw the curtain back on a period that the Chinese Communist Party and the Japanese hoped was shrouded in official declarations of a new collaboration. But it turned out there was a lot of unfinished business.''         Fluent in Mandarin, Ms. Chang traveled to China, where she scoured archives and interviewed elderly survivors. What she learned would force her to describe the indescribable:         ''Many soldiers went beyond rape to disembowel women, slice off their breasts, nail them alive to walls,'' Ms. Chang wrote. ''Fathers were forced to rape their daughters, and sons their mothers, as other family members watched. Not only did live burials, castration, the carving of organs and the roasting of people become routine, but more diabolical tortures were practiced, such as hanging people by their tongues on iron hooks or burying people to their waists and watching them torn apart by German shepherds. So sickening was the spectacle that even Nazis in the city were horrified.''         ''The Rape of Nanking'' spent 10 weeks on the New York Times best-seller list, and close to half a million copies have been sold, Ms. Rabiner said.         The book drew wide international attention. In Japan it prompted outrage among conservatives. (A planned Japanese edition was cancelled in 1999.) Elsewhere it engendered demands for the Japanese government to make reparations or, at least, a formal apology, something Ms. Chang to the end of her life felt had been inadequately done.         ''There have been all sorts of little fragments and shards and bits and pieces,'' Mr. Schell said. ''But no one has done what Willy Brandt did: got down on his knees in the Warsaw ghetto and asked forgiveness.''         Iris Shun-Ru Chang was born on March 28, 1968, in Princeton, N.J. She grew up in Champaign-Urbana, Ill., where her father, a physicist, and her mother, a microbiologist, taught at the University of Illinois. Ms. Chang received a bachelor's degree in journalism from Illinois in 1989. After working briefly as a reporter for The Associated Press and The Chicago Tribune, she earned a master's degree from the writing program of Johns Hopkins University in 1991.         She published her first book, ''Thread of the Silkworm'' (Basic Books, 1995), when she was just 27. It told the story of Tsien Hsue-shen, a Chinese-born scientist deported from the United States during the McCarthy era, who returned to China and founded that country's intercontinental missile program. Ms. Chang also wrote ''The Chinese in America: A Narrative History,'' published last year by Viking.         At the time of her death, she was researching a book on American soldiers who served in tank units on the Bataan peninsula before World War II, many of whom were captured and imprisoned by the Japanese. In the course of her research several months ago, Ms. Chang became severely depressed and had to be hospitalized, Ms. Rabiner said.         Besides her husband, Ms. Chang is survived by her parents, Shau-Jin and Ying-Ying, and a brother, Michael, all of San Jose; and by a son, Christopher.         In a 1998 interview with The Straits Times of Singapore, Ms. Chang described her reasons for writing ''The Rape of Nanking'':         ''I wrote it out of a sense of rage,'' she said. ''I didn't really care if I made a cent from it. It was important to me that the world knew what happened in Nanking back in 1937.''       
         Frederica de Laguna, an anthropologist whose work on the history and culture of little-known Arctic civilizations was groundbreaking in the most literal sense of the word, died on Oct. 6 at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 98.         Her death was announced by Bryn Mawr College, where Dr. de Laguna was the William R. Kenan Jr. professor emeritus of anthropology. She founded the college's anthropology department and taught there from 1938 until her retirement in 1975.         An authority on Alaskan prehistory, Dr. de Laguna was part of the first generation of women to succeed in the rough-and-ready, ultramasculine world of early 20th century field archaeology. She traveled thousands of miles by steamship and skiff, leading expeditions to villages so remote they appeared on no map. There, she contended with -- and generally got the better of -- bitter cold, frozen ground, ravenous mosquitoes and the rare male colleague foolhardy enough to question her ability.         ''I love the actual digging, the rhythmical swing of the arms and the bending and pushing with the whole body,'' Dr. de Laguna wrote in ''Voyage to Greenland'' (1977), a memoir of her first field trip, made when she was 22. ''The sun shines warmly over my back, the rich, sweet smell of rotted blubber rises from the saturated earth.''         In 1975, Dr. de Laguna and Margaret Mead were the first female anthropologists elected to the National Academy of Sciences. Among her best-known books are ''The Archaeology of Cook Inlet'' (1934), ''The Prehistory of Northern North America as Seen From the Yukon'' (1947), ''Chugach Prehistory: The Archeology of Prince William Sound, Alaska'' (1956) and her three-volume masterwork, ''Under Mount Saint Elias: The History and Culture of the Yakutat Tlingit'' (1972). She was the subject of a 1997 documentary film, ''Reunion Under Mount Saint Elias.''         When Dr. de Laguna made her first trip to Alaska, in 1930, Arctic culture was virtually unknown. Victorian explorers had brought back trunkfuls of artifacts, but no scholar before her had studied an Arctic community in depth.         ''She was really trying to find any possible kind of evidence that could converge to give us the overall history of these peoples,'' said Regna Darnell, an anthropologist at the University of Western Ontario and a former student of Dr. de Laguna's. ''Those early papers are a database that people have worked with ever since.''         Frederica Annis Lopez de Leo de Laguna, almost always called Freddy, was born on Oct. 3, 1906, in Ann Arbor, Mich. She grew up in Bryn Mawr, where her parents taught philosophy. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Bryn Mawr in 1927 and, in 1933, a doctorate in anthropology from Columbia, where she was one of the last students of the anthropologist Franz Boas.         In 1929, while still a graduate student, she joined a Danish expedition to a tiny island on Greenland's west coast. She planned to stay six weeks. She stayed nearly six months.         ''How could I realize the hold which this experience -- the free life, the happy, fascinating natives, the absorbing work and the loyal comradeship -- has obtained over me,'' she wrote in a letter home at the end of the trip. ''I feel as if I could never be content with ordinary living again, unless it were to be broken by a return to the Arctic. It makes me very sad to know that I have found my ideal vocation in such an inaccessible place.''         She was so sure of her vocation, and its incompatibility with married life, that she broke her engagement to a young mining engineer. She never married, and left no immediate survivors.         A Wave in World War II, Dr. de Laguna also studied the Pima Indians of Arizona. She wrote two mystery novels with anthropological settings, ''The Arrow Points to Murder'' (1937) and ''Fog on the Mountain'' (1938).         While Dr. de Laguna's work drew praise from many of the Alaskan Natives whose traditions she explored, she had limited patience with the sensitivities of the multicultural era. In recent years, she was called upon to defend her practice -- routine among anthropologists of her generation -- of opening the graves of indigenous people and removing their contents for study.         With the passage of the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act in 1990, many of these remains, which had been in museums for decades, were returned for reburial. Dr. de Laguna regretted the loss to scholarship in no uncertain terms.         ''Some of our ancestors went to the stake for the right to do science,'' she told The Baltimore Sun in 1997. ''Now we have to kowtow to the superstition of these Indians.''       
         Susan Sontag, the novelist, essayist and critic whose impassioned advocacy of the avant-garde and equally impassioned political pronouncements made her one of the most lionized presences -- and one of the most polarizing -- in 20th-century letters, died yesterday morning in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 71.         The cause was complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, her son, David Rieff, said. Ms. Sontag, who died at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, had been ill with cancer intermittently for the last 30 years, a struggle that informed one of her most famous books, the critical study ''Illness as Metaphor'' (1978).         A highly visible public figure since the mid-1960's, Ms. Sontag wrote four novels, dozens of essays and a volume of short stories and was also an occasional filmmaker, playwright and theater director. For four decades her work was part of the contemporary canon, discussed everywhere from graduate seminars to the pages of popular magazines to the Hollywood movie ''Bull Durham.''         Ms. Sontag's work made a radical break with traditional postwar criticism in America, gleefully blurring the boundaries between high and popular culture. She advocated an aesthetic approach to the study of culture, championing style over content. She was concerned, in short, with sensation, in both meanings of the term.         ''The theme that runs through Susan's writing is this lifelong struggle to arrive at the proper balance between the moral and the aesthetic,'' Leon Wieseltier, literary editor of The New Republic and an old friend of Ms. Sontag's, said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''There was something unusually vivid about her writing. That's why even if one disagrees with it -- as I did frequently -- it was unusually stimulating. She showed you things you hadn't seen before; she had a way of reopening questions.''         Through four decades, public response to Ms. Sontag remained irreconcilably divided. She was described, variously, as explosive, anticlimactic, original, derivative, naïve, sophisticated, approachable, aloof, condescending, populist, puritanical, sybaritic, sincere, posturing, ascetic, voluptuary, right-wing, left-wing, profound, superficial, ardent, bloodless, dogmatic, ambivalent, lucid, inscrutable, visceral, reasoned, chilly, effusive, relevant, passé, tenacious, ecstatic, melancholic, humorous, humorless, deadpan, rhapsodic, cantankerous and clever. No one ever called her dull.         Ms. Sontag's best-known books, all published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux, include the novels ''Death Kit'' (1967), ''The Volcano Lover'' (1992) and ''In America'' (2000); the essay collections ''Against Interpretation'' (1966), ''Styles of Radical Will'' (1969) and ''Under the Sign of Saturn'' (1980); the critical studies ''On Photography'' (1977) and ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' (1989); and the short-story collection ''I, Etcetera'' (1978). One of her most famous works, however, was not a book, but an essay, ''Notes on Camp,'' published in 1964 and still widely read.         Her most recent book, published last year, was ''Regarding the Pain of Others,'' a long essay on the imagery of war and disaster. One of her last published essays, ''Regarding the Torture of Others,'' written in response to the abuse of Iraqi prisoners by Americans at Abu Ghraib, appeared in the May 23, 2004, issue of The New York Times Magazine.         An Intellectual With Glamour         Unlike most serious intellectuals, Ms. Sontag was also a celebrity, partly because of her telegenic appearance, partly because of her outspoken statements. She was undoubtedly the only writer of her generation to win major literary prizes (among them a National Book Critics Circle Award, a National Book Award and a MacArthur Foundation genius grant) and to appear in films by Woody Allen and Andy Warhol; to be the subject of rapturous profiles in Rolling Stone and People magazines; and to be photographed by Annie Leibovitz for an Absolut Vodka ad. Through the decades her image -- strong features, wide mouth, intense gaze and dark mane crowned in her middle years by a sweeping streak of white -- became an instantly recognizable artifact of 20th-century popular culture.         Ms. Sontag was a master synthesist who tackled broad, difficult and elusive subjects: the nature of art, the nature of consciousness and, above all, the nature of the modern condition. Where many American critics before her had mined the past, Ms. Sontag became an evangelist of the new, training her eye on the culture unfolding around her.         For Ms. Sontag, culture encompassed a vast landscape. She wrote serious studies of popular art forms, like cinema and science fiction, that earlier critics disdained. She produced impassioned essays on the European writers and filmmakers she admired, like Jean-Paul Sartre, Roland Barthes, Walter Benjamin and Jean-Luc Godard. She wrote experimental novels on dreams and the nature of consciousness. She published painstaking critical dissections of photography and dance; illness, politics and pornography; and, most famously, camp. Her work, with its emphasis on the outré, the jagged and the here and now, helped make the study of popular culture a respectable academic pursuit.         What united Ms. Sontag's output was a propulsive desire to define the forces that shape the modernist sensibility. And in so doing, she sought to explain what it meant to be human in the waning years of the 20th century.         To many critics, her work was bold and thrilling. Interviewed in The Times Magazine in 1992, the Mexican writer Carlos Fuentes compared Ms. Sontag to the Renaissance humanist Erasmus. ''Erasmus traveled with 32 volumes, which contained all the knowledge worth knowing,'' he said. ''Susan Sontag carries it in her brain! I know of no other intellectual who is so clear-minded, with a capacity to link, to connect, to relate.''         A Bevy of Detractors         Others were less enthralled. Some branded Ms. Sontag an unoriginal thinker, a popularizer with a gift for aphorism who could boil down difficult writers for mass consumption. (Irving Howe called her ''a publicist able to make brilliant quilts from grandmother's patches.'') Some regarded her tendency to revisit her earlier, often controversial positions as ambivalent. Some saw her scholarly approach to popular art forms as pretentious. (Ms. Sontag once remarked that she could appreciate Patti Smith because she had read Nietzsche.)         In person Ms. Sontag could be astringent, particularly if she felt she had been misunderstood. She grew irritated when reporters asked how many books she had in her apartment in the Chelsea neighborhood of Manhattan (15,000; no television set). But she could also be warm and girlish, speaking confidingly in her rich, low voice, her feet propped casually on the nearest coffee table. She laughed readily, and when she discussed something that engaged her passionately (and there were many things), her dark eyes often filled with tears.         Ms. Sontag had a knack -- or perhaps a penchant -- for getting into trouble. She could be provocative to the point of being inflammatory, as when she championed the Nazi-era filmmaker Leni Riefenstahl in a 1965 essay; she would revise her position some years later. She celebrated the communist societies of Cuba and North Vietnam; just as provocatively, she later denounced communism as a form of fascism. After the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, she wrote in The New Yorker, ''Whatever may be said of the perpetrators of Tuesday's slaughter, they were not cowards.'' And in 2000, the publication of Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' raised accusations of plagiarism, charges she vehemently denied.         Ms. Sontag was born Susan Rosenblatt in Manhattan on Jan. 16, 1933, the daughter of Jack and Mildred Rosenblatt. Her father was a fur trader in China, and her mother joined him there for long periods, leaving Susan and her younger sister in the care of relatives. When Susan was 5, her father died in China of tuberculosis. Seeking relief for Susan's asthma, her mother moved the family to Tucson, spending the next several years there. In Arizona, Susan's mother met Capt. Nathan Sontag, a World War II veteran sent there to recuperate. The couple were married -- Susan took her stepfather's name -- and the family moved to Los Angeles.         For Susan, who graduated from high school before her 16th birthday, the philistinism of American culture was a torment she vowed early to escape. ''My greatest dream,'' she later wrote, ''was to grow up and come to New York and write for Partisan Review and be read by 5,000 people.''         She would get her wish -- Ms. Sontag burst onto the scene with ''Notes on Camp,'' which was published in Partisan Review -- but not before she earned a bachelor's and two master's degrees from prestigious American universities; studied at Oxford on a fellowship; and married, became a mother and divorced eight years later, all by the time she turned 26.         After graduating from high school, Ms. Sontag spent a semester at the University of California, Berkeley, before transferring to the University of Chicago, from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1951. At Chicago she wandered into a class taught by the sociologist Philip Rieff, then a 28-year-old instructor, who would write the celebrated study ''Freud: The Mind of the Moralist'' (Viking, 1959). He was, she would say, the first person with whom she could really talk; they were married 10 days later. Ms. Sontag was 17 and looked even younger, clad habitually in blue jeans, her black hair spilling down her back. Word swept around campus that Dr. Rieff had married a 14-year-old American Indian.         An Academic Beginning         Moving with her husband to Boston, Ms. Sontag earned her master's degrees from Harvard, the first in English, in 1954, the second in philosophy the next year. She began work on a Ph.D., but did not complete her dissertation. In 1952 she and Dr. Rieff became the parents of a son, David Rieff, who survives her. Mr. Rieff lives in Manhattan and was for many years his mother's editor at Farrar, Straus & Giroux. (A journalist, he wrote ''Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West,'' published by Simon & Schuster in 1995.) Also surviving is her younger sister, Judith Cohen of Maui.         After further study at Oxford and in Paris, Ms. Sontag was divorced from Dr. Rieff in 1958. In early 1959 she arrived in New York with, as she later described it, ''$70, two suitcases and a 7- year- old.'' She worked as an editor at Commentary and juggled teaching jobs at City College, Sarah Lawrence and Columbia. She published her first essays, critical celebrations of modernists she admired, as well as her first novel, ''The Benefactor'' (1963), an exploration of consciousness and dreams.         With ''Notes on Camp'' Ms. Sontag fired a shot across the bow of the New York critical establishment, which included eminences like Lionel and Diana Trilling, Alfred Kazin and Irving Howe. Interlaced with epigrams from Oscar Wilde, that essay illuminated a particular modern sensibility -- one that had been largely the province of gay culture -- which centered deliciously on artifice, exaggeration and the veneration of style.         ''The experiences of Camp are based on the great discovery that the sensibility of high culture has no monopoly on refinement,'' Ms. Sontag wrote. ''The man who insists on high and serious pleasures is depriving himself of pleasure; he continually restricts what he can enjoy; in the constant exercise of his good taste he will eventually price himself out of the market, so to speak. Here Camp taste supervenes upon good taste as a daring and witty hedonism. It makes the man of good taste cheerful, where before he ran the risk of being chronically frustrated. It is good for the digestion.''         If that essay has today lost its capacity to shock, it is a reflection of how thoroughly Ms. Sontag did her job, serving as a guide to an underground aesthetic that was not then widely known.         ''She found in camp an aesthetic that was very different from what the straight world had acknowledged up to that point, and she managed to make camp 'straight' in a way,'' Arthur C. Danto, the Johnsonian professor emeritus of philosophy at Columbia and the art critic for The Nation, said yesterday in a telephone interview. ''I think she prepared the ground for the pop revolution, which was in many ways essentially a gay revolution, through Warhol and others. She didn't make that art, but she brought it to consciousness. She gave people a vocabulary for talking about it and thinking about it.''         The article made Ms. Sontag an international celebrity, showered with lavish, if unintentionally ridiculous, titles (''a literary pinup,'' ''the dark lady of American letters,'' ''the Natalie Wood of the U.S. avant-garde'').         Championing Style Over Content         In 1966 Ms. Sontag published her first essay collection, ''Against Interpretation.'' That book's title essay, in which she argued that art should be experienced viscerally rather than cerebrally, helped cement her reputation as a champion of style over content.         It was a position she could take to extremes. In the essay ''On Style,'' published in the same volume, Ms. Sontag offended many readers by upholding the films of Leni Riefenstahl as masterworks of aesthetic form, with little regard for their content. Ms. Sontag would eventually reconsider her position in the 1974 essay ''Fascinating Fascism.''         Though she thought of herself as a novelist, it was through her essays that Ms. Sontag became known. As a result she was fated to write little else for the next quarter-century. She found the form an agony: a long essay took from nine months to a year to complete, often requiring 20 or more drafts.         ''I've had thousands of pages for a 30-page essay,'' she said in a 1992 interview. '''On Photography,' which is six essays, took five years. And I mean working every single day.''         That book, which won the National Book Critics Circle Award for criticism in 1978, explored the role of the photographic image, and the act of picture-taking in contemporary culture. The crush of photographs, Ms. Sontag argued, has shaped our perceptions of the world, numbing us to depictions of suffering. She would soften that position when she revisited the issue in ''Regarding the Pain of Others.''         The Washington Post Book World called ''On Photography'' ''a brilliant analysis,'' adding that it '' merely describes a phenomenon we take as much for granted as water from the tap, and how that phenomenon has changed us -- a remarkable enough achievement, when you think about it.''         In the mid-1970's Ms. Sontag learned she had breast cancer. Doctors gave her a 10 percent chance of surviving for two years. She scoured the literature for a treatment that might save her, underwent a mastectomy and persuaded her doctors to give her a two-and-a-half-year course of radiation.         Out of her experience came ''Illness as Metaphor,'' which examined the cultural mythologizing of disease (tuberculosis as the illness of 19th-century romantics, cancer a modern-day scourge). Although it did not discuss her illness explicitly, it condemned the often militaristic language around illness (''battling'' disease, the ''war'' on cancer) that Ms. Sontag felt simultaneously marginalized the sick and held them responsible for their condition..         In ''AIDS and Its Metaphors'' Ms. Sontag discussed the social implications of the disease, which she viewed as a ''cultural plague'' that had replaced cancer as the modern bearer of stigma. She would return to the subject of AIDS in her acclaimed short story ''The Way We Live Now,'' originally published in The New Yorker and included in ''The Best American Short Stories of the Century'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1999).         Although Ms. Sontag was strongly identified with the American left during the Vietnam era, in later years her politics were harder to classify. In the essay ''Trip to Hanoi,'' which appears in ''Styles of Radical Will,'' she wrote glowingly of a visit to North Vietnam. But in 1982 she delivered a stinging blow to progressives in a speech at Town Hall in Manhattan. There, at a rally in support of the Solidarity movement in Poland, she denounced European communism as ''fascism with a human face.''         In 1992, weary of essays, Ms. Sontag published ''The Volcano Lover,'' her first novel in 25 years. Though very much a novel of ideas -- it explored, among other things, notions of aesthetics and the psychology of obsessive collecting -- the book was also a big, old-fashioned historical romance. It told the story of Sir William Hamilton, the 18th-century British envoy to the court of Naples; his wife, Emma (''that Hamilton woman''); and her lover, Lord Nelson, the naval hero. The book spent two months on The New York Times best-seller list.         Reviewing the novel in The Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote: ''One thing that makes 'The Volcano Lover' such a delight to read is the way it throws off ideas and intellectual sparks, like a Roman candle or Catherine wheel blazing in the night. Miniature versions of 'Don Giovanni' and 'Tosca' lie embedded, like jewels, in the main narrative; and we are given as well some charmingly acute cameos of such historical figures as Goethe and the King and Queen of Naples.''         Ms. Sontag's final novel, ''In America,'' was loosely based on the life of the 19th-century Polish actress Helena Modjeska, who immigrated to California to start a utopian community. Though ''In America'' received a National Book Award, critical reception was mixed. Then accusations of plagiarism surfaced. As The Times reported in May 2000, a reader identified at least a dozen passages as being similar to those in four other books about the real Modjeska, including Modjeska's memoirs. Except for a brief preface expressing a general debt to ''books and articles by and on Modjeska,'' Ms. Sontag did not specifically acknowledge her sources.         Interviewed for The Times article, Ms. Sontag defended her method. ''All of us who deal with real characters in history transcribe and adopt original sources in the original domain,'' she said. ''I've used these sources and I've completely transformed them. I have these books. I've looked at these books. There's a larger argument to be made that all of literature is a series of references and allusions.''         Ms. Sontag's other work includes the play ''Alice in Bed'' (1993); ''A Susan Sontag Reader'' (1982), with an introduction by Elizabeth Hardwick; and four films, including ''Duet for Cannibals'' (1969) and ''Brother Carl'' (1971). She also edited works by Barthes, Antonin Artaud, Danilo Kis and other writers.         Ms. Sontag was the subject of an unauthorized biography by Carl Rollyson and Lisa Paddock, ''Susan Sontag: The Making of an Icon'' (Norton, 2000), and of several critical studies, including ''Sontag & Kael: Opposites Attract Me,'' by Craig Seligman (Counterpoint/Perseus, 2004). She was the president of the PEN American Center from 1987 to 1989.         In a 1992 interview with The Times Magazine, Ms. Sontag described the creative force that animated ''The Volcano Lover,'' putting her finger on the sensibility that would inform all her work: ''I don't want to express alienation. It isn't what I feel. I'm interested in various kinds of passionate engagement. All my work says, be serious, be passionate, wake up.''         A Life of the Mind         For four decades, Susan Sontag's books were published by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. These are some of the more notable.

         Agnes Martin, an American painter whose luminous fields of pale color traversed by hand-drawn pencil lines preserved the Romantic spirit of Abstract Expressionism and prefigured the austerities of Minimalism, died yesterday in a retirement community in Taos, N.M.         She was 92 and had lived in New Mexico for many years. Her death was announced by the chairman of the PaceWildenstein gallery, Arne Glimcher, her friend and longtime dealer.         In New York in the 1950's and 60's, Ms. Martin was an integral part of a small, brilliant, diverse community of artists -- Jasper Johns, Ellsworth Kelly and Robert Rauschenberg among them -- who lived in derelict 19th-century shipping lofts in Lower Manhattan and created a new postwar American art.         Yet Ms. Martin was fundamentally a loner. In 1967, when her New York career was taking off, she abruptly left the city, wandered the country for months in a pickup and camper, and stopped making art for seven years. She finally settled in New Mexico, building an adobe house with her own hands on a remote mesa where in winter she was snowed in for weeks at a time. After she resumed painting in 1974 her reputation grew and took on the aura of a legend, and her work was widely collected. She became an inspiration to younger artists, from Eva Hesse to Ellen Gallagher, attracted to her undemonstrative but intensely personal art.         Agnes Bernice Martin was born in Macklin, Saskatchewan, Canada, on March 22, 1912, a descendant of Scottish Presbyterian pioneers. Her father, a wheat farmer, died when she was 2; her mother supported the family by selling real estate. Ms. Martin spent much of her childhood with her maternal grandfather, a gentle, religious man who introduced her to inspirational literature, including John Bunyan's ''Pilgrim's Progress,'' which remained important to her throughout her life.         She had a strong early interest in art, but opted for the financial security of teaching, and in the 1940's moved to New York to study art education at Teachers College, Columbia University. While there she became aware of Abstract Expressionism, the modern style that she felt most in tune with, partly because its artists were of her generation; she and Jackson Pollock were born in the same year. It is possible to view her as the last of the generation of Abstract Expressionists.         After hearing lectures by the Zen Buddhist scholar D.T. Suzuki at Columbia, she became interested in Asian thought, not as a religious discipline, but as a code of ethics, a practical how-to for getting through life.         ''One thing I like about Zen,'' she wrote. ''It doesn't believe in achievement. I don't think the way to succeed is by doing something aggressive. Aggression is weak-minded.''         In Taos in 1954 she did her first semiabstract work. The art dealer Betty Parsons saw it and invited Ms. Martin to join her New York stable, which included Ad Reinhardt and younger artists like Mr. Kelly. The only stipulation was that Ms. Martin return to Manhattan. She did so in 1957, joining Mr. Kelly, Robert Indiana, Lenore Tawney and other artists on Coenties Slip near Wall Street. Barnett Newman, with whose art she felt a particular affinity, had a studio nearby. During the decade she spent there, she developed a fully abstract style based on tight grids and repetitive linear marks.         Then she left New York. Urban renewal was about to drastically alter her downtown neighborhood. The competitive New York art world unnerved her. A relationship may have gone wrong. Ms. Martin, who had a history of psychological crises, said elliptically, ''I came to a place of recognition of confusion that had to be solved.''         Before leaving she gave away all her paint and canvas rolls, hoping young artists would use them. Once she starting painting again in 1974, however, she worked solidly until the end of her life, in a format that seldom varied: six-foot-square canvases on which she drew horizontal graphite lines and painted bands of color with subtly vigorous strokes. She changed her palette from series to series, using pale colors one year, and black, white or gray the next.         She first showed at PaceWildenstein, formerly Pace Gallery, in 1975, and became a mainstay there. Her most recent show was in the spring, and in a departure, the paintings referred back to the geometric forms of her Coenties Slip work.         She had two career retrospectives, one at the Institute of Contemporary Art at the University of Pennsylvania in 1973, the other at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1992. In 1993 the Stedelijk Museum in Amsterdam organized a traveling survey of her post-1974 work. A selection of early paintings is on view at Dia:Beacon through April. And an installation of paintings is on permanent view in a specially designed gallery in the Harwood Museum of Art in Taos. Her work is in most major United States museum collections.         Ms. Martin was awarded a National Medal of Arts by President Clinton in 1998 and recently accepted a lifetime achievement award from the Women's Caucus for Art.         Several years ago she moved to the retirement community. There her daily routine seldom varied. She rose early and drove to her nearby studio, where she worked alone from 8:30 to 11:30 a.m. One of the few concessions she made to age was to reduce the size of her paintings so that she could continue to move them herself. She never had an assistant.         Although shy in public, Ms. Martin lectured periodically, offering her thoughts on art and life in series of epigrammatic statements that combined Victorian poetry, Buddhist philosophy, transcendentalism, American-style positive thinking and the inspirational literature of her youth. The lectures were collected into a book in 1992, ''Writings,'' which established her as a moral thinker as well as an artist. Some critics consider her words an essential complement to her ineffable paintings.         Like her paintings, her writing was lucid and severe, measured but driven. She insisted that art was not an instrument for social change and, in a post-1960's America highly conscious of racial and sexual identity, her social views tended to be conservative and provincial. Art's value, in her thinking, was in its ability to counteract negative thoughts and emotions, promote psychic calm over chaos, and establish stability in a world of unpredictable and potentially shattering change.         Before her death, Ms. Martin specified that she wanted no memorial service or eulogies. She leaves no survivors.         ''The value of art is in the observer,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times. ''When you find out what you like, you're really finding out about yourself. Beethoven's music is joyous. If you like his music, you know that you like to be joyful. People who look at my painting say that it makes them happy, like the feeling when you wake up in the morning. And happiness is the goal, isn't it?''
