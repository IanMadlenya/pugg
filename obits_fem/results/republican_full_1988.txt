Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Franco's doctor, Dr. Vicente Pozuelo Escudero, said she died of complications from bronchial pneumonia contracted on Feb. 1.         Queen Sofia went to Mrs. Franco's Madrid apartment to deliver condolences to Mrs. Franco's daughter, Carmen Franco de Martinez-Bordiu, 60, and her husband, on behalf of King Juan Carlos and herself.         In 1969, Franco designated Juan Carlos to be his successor, and Juan Carlos resumed the Spanish monarchy two days after Franco's death on Nov. 20, 1975. Figurehead of Movement         When her husband died, Mrs. Franco became the figurehead of a loosely formed organization of Franco's political followers, called ''El Movimiento.'' Each anniversary of Franco's death prompts thousands of fascists to march in the streets.         Mrs. Franco annually attended a funeral Mass in her husband's memory at the underground basilica in the Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid, where thousands of Nationalists killed in the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War are buried.         Ill health kept her from attending the 1987 memorial. An estimated 5,000 people attended the Mass, at the end of which they gave the fascist salute and shouted ''Franco! Franco! Franco!''         Mrs. Franco was born Carmen Polo on July 9, 1900, in the northern city of Oviedo, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. She was educated by Salesian nuns. In Spanish Morocco         She married Francisco Franco, then an up-and-coming army lieutenant colonel, on Oct. 22, 1923, and the couple left soon after for Spanish Morocco, where Franco was responsible for much of the conduct of the Riff Wars and where he built the military power base that served his successful uprising against the Republican Government.         Mrs. Franco exercised a strong influence on her husband, particularly in connection with affairs of the Roman Catholic Church and public morality.         Social historians say her puritanical upbringing was responsible for the heavy censorship of anything touching on sex or sexual matters in Spanish literature, theater and cinema during most of the 1939-75 Franco regime.         A man who answered the telephone at the apartment of Mrs. Franco's daughter said burial was scheduled for Sunday in the village of El Pardo on the outskirts of Madrid.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Franco is survived by seven grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.

She was 70 years old.  Mrs. Spellman, a Democrat, was running for her fourth term in the House when her heart stopped beating temporarily on Oct. 31, 1980, while she was judging a Halloween costume contest at a shopping mall.         Two days later, she was re-elected with 80 percent of the vote over a little-known Republican, Kevin R. Igoe.         Mrs. Spellman remained hospitalized in critical condition for several weeks after her heart attack. Her condition later stabilized, and she was able to breathe without the aid of life-support equipment, but she never regained consciousness. Seat Is Declared Vacant         After receiving a medical analysis stating that Mrs. Spellman was in a ''trance-like state'' and unable to take the oath of office, the House declared her seat vacant in February 1981. It was the first time the House vacated the seat of a member who had become mentally or physically disabled.         Thirty-two Republican and Democratic candidates, including Mrs. Spellman's husband, Reuben, entered a special primary on April 7, 1981, to select the nominees to run for election in Maryland's Fifth District.         Mr. Spellman was defeated for the Democratic nomination by Steny H. Hoyer, who went on to defeat the Republican candidate, Mayor Audrey Scott of Bowie, Md., in a special election on May 19, 1981. Mr. Hoyer continues to serve in the House.         Mrs. Spellman, who was born Gladys Noon in New York City on March 2, 1918, was educated in public schools in the District of Columbia, George Washington University and the Graduate School of the Department of Agriculture.         Her first elected position was as a member of the Prince Georges County Board of Commissioners in 1962. In 1967, she was appointed by President Johnson to the Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations.         She is survived by her husband; two sons, Stephen and Richard; a daughter, Dana Spellman O'Neill, and four grandchildren.
