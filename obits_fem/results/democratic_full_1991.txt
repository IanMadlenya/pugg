         Eleanor Schley Todd, a former Republican National Committeewoman, died on Monday at her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Todd died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her daughter, Christine Todd Whitman of Far Hills, N.J., said.         In 1956, Mrs. Todd was elected vice chairman of the Republican National Committee. From 1956 to 1966, she was a Republican National Committeewoman from New Jersey. From 1946 to 1952, she was president of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women.         She attended every Republican national convention as a delegate, alternate or convention manager from 1940 to 1976, and was a member of the board of governors of the Women's National Republican Club.         She was also active in civic affairs. In 1983, Gov. Thomas H. Kean appointed her to the New Jersey Board of Higher Education, where she served until 1988. She was a member of the Regional Planning Association and of the Hunterdon County Parks Commission.         In 1957 she was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a post she held until 1967. During World War II, she was chairman of the New Jersey Red Cross Canteen.         Mrs. Todd was born in Monmouth Beach, N.J., and was educated at the Chapin School, the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., Barnard and Sarah Lawrence Colleges and at Columbia University, from which she graduated in 1967.         She was a past chairman of the board of the Far Hills Country Day School and of the Foxcroft School. She was also a member of the Council of Independent Schools.         Her daughter, Mrs. Whitman, was narrowly defeated by the Democratic incumbent from New Jersey, Bill Bradley, in her recent campaign for the United States Senate.         Mrs. Todd's husband, Webster Bray Todd, a former state Republican state chairman in New Jersey, died in 1989.         Besides Mrs. Whitman, Mrs. Todd is survived by another daughter, Kate Beach of Washington; a son, Webster B. Todd Jr. of Pray, Mont.; a brother, Reeve Schley Jr. of Whitehouse, N.J., and eight grandchildren.       
         Mary de Groat Reed, a leader in the reform wing of the Democratic Party in Manhattan in the 1950's, died on Tuesday at the Southampton Nursing Home on Long Island. She was 77 years old and lived in Sagaponack, L.I.         She died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Mrs. Reed, a native of Duluth, Minn., was a graduate of Wells College and held a master's degree from the University of Geneva. In World War II she was with the Office of Inter-American Affairs in Washington.         She was a founder of the New Democratic Club in the Eighth Assembly District South on the East Side, one of the first clubs in what was to become the reform movement in the party. She was elected district leader in 1955 and 1957. She left New York in 1959, but remained active in Democratic politics.         She is survived by two daughters, Julia, of Manhattan, and Cornelia, of Sagaponack.       
         Katie Louchheim, a former State Department official and a former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee who was a prominent figure in the social life of Washington for four decades, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Louchheim, who had been in failing health for the last few years, died of pneumonia, her family said.         Although she never held elective office, her influence in politics was considerable, beginning in 1934 when she arrived in Washington with her husband, Walter, a Manhattan investment counselor. He had been called on to help organize the Securities and Exchange Commission in the early days of Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal.         Mrs. Louchheim was also a poet, and the Louchheims' house in Georgetown soon became a meeting place for people in politics and the arts. A vivacious woman of enormous energy, she plunged into Democratic Party affairs and worked her way up to become vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee from 1956 to 1960. Posts in United Nations         Along the way, she held various appointed government posts. In World War II she served in the Office of Foreign Relief and Rehabilitation and helped form its United Nations counterpart, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, for which she went to Europe in 1945 to arrange press relations at camps for displaced people.         President John F. Kennedy gave her a post in the State Department, and within two years she was named Deputy Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs, at that time the highest job in the department ever held by a woman.         She moved to other State Department posts through the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson and was United States Ambassador to the United Nations Economic, Scientific and Cultural Organization until 1969, when the Republicans took power under President Richard M. Nixon. Rejected Republican Roots         Mrs. Louchheim was born in Manhattan in 1903. Named Kathleen Scofield, she was known for most of her life as Katie. The daughter of a Manhattan stockbroker, she grew up in Republican surroundings; when she moved to Washington in Roosevelt's first term she was a prime example of what people called "a traitor to one's class."         She attended Rosemary Hall in Greenwich, Conn., and studied in Europe before marrying Mr. Louchheim in 1926.         She published a collection of poems, "With or Without Roses," in 1966. Her autobiography, "By the Political Sea," came out in 1970. She wrote "The Making of the New Deal -- The Insiders Speak," published by Harvard University Press in 1983.         After her husband died in 1973, Mrs. Louchheim moved back to Manhattan. In 1981 she married Donald S. Klopfer, a co-founder of the publishing concern Random House; he died in 1986.         She is survived by two daughters, Mary Evangelista of Manhattan and Judith Read of Darien, Conn.; three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Ulman Rowe, former chairwoman of the National Capital Planning Commission and a leader in urban beautification, died yesterday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. She was 79 years old and lived in Washington.         Mrs. Rowe died of pnuemonia, a spokesman for the family said.         Active in Democratic Party campaigns, she was named to the National Planning Commission by President John F. Kennedy. She headed the commission from 1961 to 1968. She also headed the Parks and History Association, a private group supporting the National Parks Service.         Her husband, James Henry Rowe, an adviser to Presidents Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, died in 1984.         She is survived by a son, James H. 3d of Washington; two daughters, Elizabeth Costle of Woodstock, Vt., and Clarissa Batzell of Arlington, Mass.; a sister, Jean Friendly of Washington; and six grandchildren.       
         Clara Leiser, founder of Youth of All Nations, a nonprofit peace organization that grew out of her experience with refugee children in World War II, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, said her niece, Anita Leiser, with whom she lived.         Miss Leiser began her career as assistant editor and advertising manager of The Wisconsin Journal of Education. In the late 1920's she resigned to take what was to be the first of many trips to Europe in the 1930's.         Moved by events she had witnessed during the rise of Nazism, she sought to ease the adjustment of hundreds of teen-age refugees from fascism, asking them what they missed most. Nearly all answered "friends."         The result, in 1944, was Youth of All Nations, devoted to building understanding among the youth of many countries, races and religious beliefs through a correspondence program.         To show how letters could improve international understanding, Miss Leiser would cite correspondence from a young German boy whose letters revealed his gradual understanding of democratic ideals.         She wrote or edited several books, among them "Skeleton of Justice," with Edith Roper (E.P. Dutton, 1941); "Lunacy Becomes Us," quotations from Hitler and other top Nazis (Liveright, 1939); "Jean de Reszke and the Great Days of Opera" (Minton, Balch, 1934).         A native of Milwaukee, Miss Leiser was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin.         She is survived by a sister, Gertrude B. Wilde of Milwaukee.       
         Geraldine N. Moon, vice chairwoman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, died at her home in Camden County on Wednesday. She was 57 years old.         Mrs. Moon died of cancer, said her husband, Hampden.         At her death, she was serving a second two-year term as first vice chairwoman of the committee. Mrs. Moon was also a member of the Democratic National Committee. She was a political associate of Gov. Jim Florio, who is also from Camden County.         She was Winslow Township's deputy tax assessor from 1974 until June 1990, when illness forced a leave of absence.         Mrs. Moon was also the founder of the Camden County chapter of the National Political Congress of Black Women. She graduated from Pierce Business School in Philadelphia and attended Rutgers University in Camden.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by six sisters and two brothers.       
         Mimi Schnall, a Westchester County Democratic committeewoman, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 57 years old and lived in Greenburgh, N.Y.         Mrs. Schnall died of gall bladder cancer, her husband said.         She was elected first vice chairwoman of the Westchester Democratic Committee in 1986. She was also a former chairwoman of the Town of Greenburgh Democratic Committee for many years, a delegate to the 1980 Democratic National Convention in Manhattan and the Westchester County coordinator for Mario M. Cuomo's first campaign for governor.         Beginning in 1974, Mrs. Schnall was director of volunteers for the Westchester Lighthouse, a local subsidiary of the New York Lighthouse for the Blind, for 17 years.         She is survived by her husband, Albert, executive vice president of Complus Data Innovations Inc. in Hawthorne, N.Y.; a daughter, Lisa Schnall of Brooklyn; three sons, Michael, of White Plains, David, of Bedford, N.Y. and Peter, of Washington; a brother, Dr. Robert Ascheim of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
         Marietta Tree, a daughter of privilege who won plaudits as a representative to the United Nations in the 1960's and as a tireless worker for New York City causes, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 74 years old.         She died of cancer, her son-in-law, James Sterba, said.         Mrs. Tree was appointed a representative to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights in 1961 and served also as a special adviser to the United States delegation. She remained at the United Nations until 1967, serving in several         posts, including delegate to the Trusteeship Council.         In the last decade, she was chairwoman of the Citizens Committee for New York City, a group that tries to help neighborhood groups improve their communities.  She resigned her post because of illness nine months ago.         Mrs. Tree came from a distinguished family and privileged circumstances and could have spent her life quite insulated from the tensions of international diplomacy and the frustrations of a city that so frequently seemed to be in crisis. But that is not what she wanted. Tributes From Friends         Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian, a close friend of Mrs. Tree's for many years, said: "Her ambition was to be a combination of Mrs. Roosevelt and Carole Lombard. And that is what she was."         Another close friend agreed. "She was elegant, glorious and sparkling," saidOsborne Elliot, who was founding chairman of the Citizens Committee and who, since her resignation, has returned as chairman. "She set many drawing rooms         afire. But more importantly, she cared deeply about the world, the nation, this city and its people."         Mrs. Tree was born in Lawrence, Mass., the daughter of the Right Rev. Malcolm Endicott Peabody, an Episcopal clergyman, who from 1940 to 1962 was Bishop for Central New York State of the Episcopal Church. Her mother was the former Mary Parkman, daughter of a prominent New England family.         The family believed that it was a responsibility to dedicate at least some of one's life to public service, and the message was received by all five of their children. One of Mrs. Tree's brothers, Endicott, became Governor of Massachusetts.         The Peabodys moved around a bit before World War II. For a time they lived in Philadelphia, where Mr. Peabody was minister of St. Paul's Church in Chestnut Hill and young Marietta attended Springside Academy. She also attended St. Timothy's School in Baltimore and the Petite Ecole Florentine in Florence, Italy. From 1936 to 1939, she attended the University of Pennsylvania, where she concentrated in political science.         In 1939, she married Desmond FitzGerald, a lawyer and conservative Republican. The marriage ended in divorce in 1947. The couple had a daughter, Frances FitzGerald, an author whose nonfiction best-seller "Fire in the Lake,"         about the Vietnam War, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1973.         Soon after the divorce, Marietta married Ronald Tree, a former Conservative member of the British Parliament. He died in 1976. The two had a daughter, Penelope Tree, who became a model.         During World War II Mrs. Tree worked as a researcher at Life magazine. After the war she became active in liberal Democratic politics in New York. She was on the New York State Democratic Committee from 1954 to 1960 and was one of Adlai E. Stevenson's chief aides when he ran for President against Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956.         After John F. Kennedy was elected President, he appointed Mrs. Tree to the United Nations job, where she served when Mr. Stevenson was the top United States representative there.         "I work in the political field because I believe that everyone in a community has duties as well as rights," Mrs. Tree said in 1961. "I am impelled by a feeling that I have so many blessings I must somehow try to pay for them in hard         work for the community and in gratitude for being an American. I have to try and pay my debt to God."         After her diplomatic service ended, Mrs. Tree became increasingly interested in urban problems. She was a partner in the city planning firm of Llewelyn-Davies Associates, a British organization, and ran its New York office from 1968 to 1980. She was neither an architect nor a planner but rather, as her brother, Malcolm, recalls it, "a rainmaker" who was able to motivate city officials. She worked on a slum rehabilitation project in Manila and consulted on various projects in Hong Kong, Borneo, Beirut and elsewhere. Held New York City Post         Her interest in New York City was evident early on. In 1944 she was one of the founders of Sydenham Hospital, then hailed as the first interracial voluntary hospital in the United States. Mayor Robert F. Wagner appointed her to the city's Commission on Intergroup Relations in 1959.         Among her other activites was service on the board of directors of the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedoms Foundation, the Marconi International Foundation and the Winston Churchill Foundation. She also was on the boards of         CBS and Pan American World Airways.         Among the survivors are her daughters, Frances FitzGerald of Manhattan and Penelope Tree of Sydney, Australia; four brothers, Endicott, of Hollis, N.H.; George L., of Washington, an educational consultant; , Samuel P., of Manhattan, a philanthropist, and Malcolm E., of Washington, a real-estate developer.         Funeral arrangements are incomplete. Mrs. Tree will be cremated and her remains buried in Northeast Harbor, Me. There will be a memorial service in New York City in September, but the date and location have not yet been selected, the family said.         Correction:  August 17, 1991, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Marietta Tree, a former United Nations representative and campaigner for New York City causes, rendered the name of the founding chairman of the Citizens Committee for New York City incorrectly. He is Osborn Elliott.       
         Veronica Perry, a Harlem teacher and the mother of Edmund Perry, the honor student fatally shot by a police officer on Morningside Drive on June 12, 1985, died on Oct. 4 at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 44 years old.         She died as a result of a heart condition, the funeral home said.         Mrs. Perry, a fifth-generation Harlem resident and a graduate of Bronx Community College and Fordham University, was a teacher for the Lenox Hill Association. She was a past president of Community School Board 3 and of the Parent-Teacher Association of Wadleigh Junior High School and was a member of the Sojourner Truth Democratic Club.         She is survived by her husband, Jonah Perry Sr.; her mother, Eva Rutledge; a son, Jonah Jr.; a daughter, Nicol, and several brothers and sisters.       
         Dorothy Vredenburgh Bush, the secretary of the Democratic National Committee who called the roll and tallied the votes at 12 national conventions from 1944 to 1988, died on Saturday in a hospital in Naples, Fla. She was 75 years old.         Mrs. Bush died of lung cancer, her stepdaughter, Jan Bush Jennings, told The Associated Press.         At each Democratic national convention, from the one that nominated the Roosevelt-Truman ticket to the one that drafted Michael S. Dukakis and Lloyd Bensten, Mrs. Bush called the role of states in a slight, but crisp, Dixie-accented voice that made her a fixture of the convention floor and a legend in the party. 'Born a Democrat'         "I was born a Democrat," she said before the 1976 convention, "like most people were born into religion."         Dorothy McElroy was born on Dec. 8, 1916, in Baldwyn, Miss., the third daughter of a postmaster. When she was in the eighth grade, her family moved to Columbus, Miss., so that she and her sisters could attend Mississippi State College for Women, from which she graduated in 1938.         In 1940, she married Peter Vredenburgh 3d, a wealthy Alabama lumberman and prominent Democrat, and quickly became enmeshed in politics. She was elected national committee woman of the Alabama Young Democrats in 1941 and a vice-president of the Young Democratic Clubs of America in 1943.         She was just 27 years old when she was named secretary to the Democratic National Committee in 1944. She was the first woman -- and the youngest person -- ever to serve in the position, which is unpaid.         Mr. Vredenburgh died in 1956, and in 1962 she married John W. Bush, then a member of the Interstate Commerce Commission.         In addition to her work at the conventions, she also arranged meetings of the national and executive committees and kept party records.         She retired in September 1989.         In addition to Mr. Bush and Mrs. Jennings, she is survived by another stepdaughter, Emily Bush Zuckett.
