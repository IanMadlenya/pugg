        Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year.

Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year. Known for her dramatic power, Ms. Kaye, who was born in New York City in 1920, was a member of American Ballet Theater from its inception in 1940 until 1951, and again from 1954 to 1959. In between, she appeared with the New York City Ballet. Celebrated for her interpretations of the psychological ballets of Antony Tudor, she also danced in works by Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins.         The memorial included speeches by two ballerinas: Alicia Alonso, the Cuban dancer who was part of American Ballet Theater from 1940 until 1955, and Dame Margot Fonteyn, the former star of England's Royal Ballet. ''In her dance,'' Ms. Alonso said of Ms. Kaye, ''there was life always.'' Dame Margot called Ms. Kaye ''the most wonderful friend - understanding, perceptive, encouraging.''         Mr. Robbins analyzed Ms. Kaye's dramatic gift, saying that he believed she was theatrically striking not because she was flamboyant, but because of her gestural economy. Mr. Robbins recalled how last summer, while sitting at a cafe in Spoleto, Italy, he fancied he saw Ms. Kaye pass by.         Other tributes came from Leo Lerman, the theatrical writer; Mike Nichols, the director, and John Taras, Ballet Theater's associate director. Several speakers recalled how Ms. Kaye assisted her second husband, Herbert Ross, the choreographer and director, in his theatrical and film projects. Musical Tributes, as Well         Ms. Kaye had been married first to the violinist Isaac Stern. Mr. Stern was present to play Mozart's Violin Sonata in E minor, with Leonard Bernstein as pianist. Other musical selections included songs by Bernadette Peters and Barbara Cook. Leslie Browne and Robert Hill, of Ballet Theater, offered an excerpt from Tudor's ''Leaves Are Fading.''         The afternoon's touching conclusion came when Lynn Seymour, a British ballerina whose intensity has been likened to that of Ms. Kaye, danced Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan.'' When she stepped forward scattering rose petals, she could have been offering a floral tribute to Ms. Kaye.         Then, with Mr. Bernstein at the piano, Stephanie Friede sang ''Im Abendrot,'' one of Richard Strauss's ''Four Last Songs,'' which accompanied Tudor's ''Hail and Farewell,'' his last ballet for Ms. Kaye. It had been given its premiere by the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1959, with Ms. Kaye as guest artist; she retired in 1961. Possessing a theme that symbolized death and transfiguration, ''Im Abendrot'' sounded especially eloquent.       
        Judith Somogi, one of the first women to become a conductor, died at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I., Wednesday morning. She was 47 years old and had suffered from cancer for four years.         Judith Somogi, one of the first women to become a conductor, died at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I., Wednesday morning. She was 47 years old and had suffered from cancer for four years.         Miss Somogi's early successes were at the New York City Opera, where she made her 1974 debut in ''The Mikado'' and ''La Traviata,'' thus becoming the company's first female conductor. Yet, the preponderance of her career was centered in Europe. Beginning in 1981, Miss Somogi became first Kapellmeister under Michael Gielen at the Frankfurt Opera and left there only last year with the departure of Mr. Gielen and the dismantling of his organization. Miss Somogi's last appearance was six months ago conducting ''Das Rheingold'' in Frankfurt.         She never returned to the New York stage after moving to West Germany. During her Frankfurt career, she presided over new productions of ''Il Turco in Italia,'' ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' ''Tales of Hoffmann'' and ''Das Rheingold.'' Miss Somogi's American appearances during her European years were confined to productions at the Tulsa Opera. Joined City Opera in '66         She joined the City Opera in 1966 as a rehearsal pianist, spending her summers as assistant conductor to Thomas Schippers at the Spoleto Festival in Italy. There were also purely instrumental conducting appearances with the New York and Los Angeles Philharmonics and more opera with various regional companies across the United States.         At the time Miss Somogi was hired in Frankfurt, Mr. Gielen said: ''We took her because she was the best. Our orchestra has some old experienced hands who cannot be taught very much. Within five minutes she had them on the edge of their seats.''         Judith Somogi was born in Brooklyn of a Hungarian father and a Sicilian mother. She said she had gained valuable experience as a church organist and choir director in Lynbrook, L.I., and as a pianist, she went on earn two degrees at Juilliard. ''Conducting,'' Miss Somogi once said, ''is something you learn by doing.''         She is survived by her parents, Louis and Antonina, and by her sister, Jane, all of Lynbrook.       
        Jeanne Behrend, a pianist and composer who specialized in American music, died March 20 after a long illness at the Logan East retirement community care center in Philadelphia. She was 76 years old.         Jeanne Behrend, a pianist and composer who specialized in American music, died March 20 after a long illness at the Logan East retirement community care center in Philadelphia. She was 76 years old.         Miss Behrend was born in Philadelphia and made her first public apperarance there at the age of 11. In 1934 she graduated from the city's Curtis Institute, where she studied piano with Josef Hofmann and composition with Rosario Scalero.         Her New York debut followed in 1937 at Carnegie Hall, with a program that included a piano sonata she had composed. Howard Taubman, writing in The New York Times, found fault with the sonata but praised her playing.         Throughout the 1940's, 50's and 60's, Miss Behrend pursued a considerable pianistic career, concentrating on the music of North and South America. Heitor Villa-Lobos, the Brazilian composer, called her ''a heroine of the Americas,'' and she played often in Latin American countries. In 1959 she founded and directed the Philadelphia Festival of Western Hemisphere Music, and in 1965 she was awarded the Brazilian Order of the Southern Cross. Gave Up Composing         As a composer, Miss Behrend produced a variety of mostly small-scale pieces, only some of which were published. After giving up composition in the late 1940's, she explained that she felt opportunities for women in composing were too limiting.         Miss Behrend taught courses in American music and piano at a variety of institutions in Philadelphia as well as at the Juilliard School in New York. A Gottschalk expert, she edited a selection of his piano scores as well as his autobiography, ''Notes of a Pianist.'' She also edited a Stephen Foster song collection and a volume of American fuguing tunes.         Her first husband, Alexander Kelberine, a pianist, died in 1940, and her second husband, George S. McManus, a collector and dealer in books specializing in Americana, died in 1967. Miss Behrend is survived by her sister, Ruth Hagedorn, of Gadsden, Ala.       
        Pannonica de Koenigswarter, a patron of jazz performers, died Wednesday of heart failure at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 74 years old.         Pannonica de Koenigswarter, a patron of jazz performers, died Wednesday of heart failure at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 74 years old.         The Baroness de Koenigswarter offered sustanance and care to many musicians who needed help. The saxophonist Charlie Parker died in her home in 1955, and the composer and pianist Thelonious Monk lived there from 1970 until his death in 1982. Recently she had been influential in helping Barry Harris's Jazz Cultural Theater to survive.         A member of the English branch of the Rothschilds, Baroness de Koenigswarter moved to the United States in the early 1950's. As a teen-ager she had fallen in love with jazz, and she quickly became a part of the jazz world. She counted among her friends Charlie Rouse, who also died Wednesday; Coleman Hawkins, Tommy Flanagan, Barry Harris and many other important jazz musicians. They returned her affection: Mr. Monk wrote the tune ''Pannonica'' for her; the pianist Horace Silver wrote ''Nica's Dream'' and the saxophonist Gigi Gryce wrote ''Nica's Tempo.''         She is survived by three daughters, two sons and one grandchild. There is to be a memorial service on Dec. 11 at St. Peter's Church, 54th Street and Lexington Avenue.
