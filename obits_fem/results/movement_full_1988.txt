        Patricia Anne Hoffman Friedman, executive vice president and a partner in International Contract Furnishings, an importer and manufacturer of modern office and residential furniture, died of cancer Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 44 years old.         Patricia Anne Hoffman Friedman, executive vice president and a partner in International Contract Furnishings, an importer and manufacturer of modern office and residential furniture, died of cancer Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 44 years old.         An interior and furniture designer, Pat Hoffman, as she was known professionally, was influential in introducing avant-garde and early 20th-century European designs to the United States.         Ms. Hoffman was born March 7, 1943, in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Design. From 1965 to 1970, she worked as director of design for Koch & Lowy, a lighting firm in New York City. After spending two years in Rome working for an architectural firm, Ms. Hoffman returned to New York to join I.C.F., in charge of the company's design programs, including graphics, advertising and showroom design.         For the last 15 years, Ms. Hoffman was instrumental in introducing designs that quickly became synonymous with the avant-garde. In the early 1970's, that included Giovanetti's Anfibio sofa, by Alessandro Becchi, an oversize leather upholstered raftlike sofa bed from Italy and the Interlubke system, a sleek German storage system. Introduced International Designs         Most influential in the modern home furnishings field was Ms. Hoffman's introduction in 1975 of the furniture designs by Josef Hoffmann, the Viennese leader of the early 20th-century Wiener Werkstatte movement. The Hoffmann furniture designs were pivotal in the rediscovery and revival of many other early 20th-century classics and played a critical role in the current interest in this important period of 20th-century design.         A lamp Ms. Hoffman designed in 1969 was exhibited in ''High Styles: 20th-Century American Design'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1985. Some of her other furniture designs have been shown at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, as well as at the Mobelmesse, in Cologne, West Germany, the Salon International de Meubles in Paris and the Saloni di Mobili in Milan.         Ms. Hoffman is survived by her husband, Samuel Friedman, president of I.C.F.; her parents, John and Mae Hoffman of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and a sister, Jane Knaus.         The funeral will be held tomorrow at 11:30 A.M. at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.       
        Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Franco's doctor, Dr. Vicente Pozuelo Escudero, said she died of complications from bronchial pneumonia contracted on Feb. 1.         Queen Sofia went to Mrs. Franco's Madrid apartment to deliver condolences to Mrs. Franco's daughter, Carmen Franco de Martinez-Bordiu, 60, and her husband, on behalf of King Juan Carlos and herself.         In 1969, Franco designated Juan Carlos to be his successor, and Juan Carlos resumed the Spanish monarchy two days after Franco's death on Nov. 20, 1975. Figurehead of Movement         When her husband died, Mrs. Franco became the figurehead of a loosely formed organization of Franco's political followers, called ''El Movimiento.'' Each anniversary of Franco's death prompts thousands of fascists to march in the streets.         Mrs. Franco annually attended a funeral Mass in her husband's memory at the underground basilica in the Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid, where thousands of Nationalists killed in the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War are buried.         Ill health kept her from attending the 1987 memorial. An estimated 5,000 people attended the Mass, at the end of which they gave the fascist salute and shouted ''Franco! Franco! Franco!''         Mrs. Franco was born Carmen Polo on July 9, 1900, in the northern city of Oviedo, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. She was educated by Salesian nuns. In Spanish Morocco         She married Francisco Franco, then an up-and-coming army lieutenant colonel, on Oct. 22, 1923, and the couple left soon after for Spanish Morocco, where Franco was responsible for much of the conduct of the Riff Wars and where he built the military power base that served his successful uprising against the Republican Government.         Mrs. Franco exercised a strong influence on her husband, particularly in connection with affairs of the Roman Catholic Church and public morality.         Social historians say her puritanical upbringing was responsible for the heavy censorship of anything touching on sex or sexual matters in Spanish literature, theater and cinema during most of the 1939-75 Franco regime.         A man who answered the telephone at the apartment of Mrs. Franco's daughter said burial was scheduled for Sunday in the village of El Pardo on the outskirts of Madrid.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Franco is survived by seven grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.       
        Chaya Moussia Schneerson, the wife of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, died early yesterday at New York Hospital. She was taken to the hospital Tuesday night complaining about feeling ill. She was 86 years old and lived in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.         Chaya Moussia Schneerson, the wife of Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, died early yesterday at New York Hospital. She was taken to the hospital Tuesday night complaining about feeling ill. She was 86 years old and lived in the Crown Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn.         Thousands of her husband's followers - dressed in the black garb of the Hasidim - lined the streets for the funeral procession that began outside her home on President Street yesterday afternoon and moved slowly past the headquarters of the Lubavitch movement at 770 Eastern Parkway, near Brooklyn Avenue.         Burial was at the Old Montefiore cemetery in Springfield Gardens, Queens.         Mrs. Schneerson, who was known as the Rebbetzin, was born in the Russian city of Lubavitch, the second of three daughters of the previous Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Yitzchak Schneerson. She married Menachem Schneerson, her third cousin, in Warsaw in 1928. Together they fled Hitler, living in Paris, Nice and eventually settling in Brooklyn, in 1941.         Upon her father's death in 1950, her husband succeeded him as the Rebbe, or grand rabbi, of Lubavitch, one of the major remaining Hasidic dynasties. In keeping with Hasidic tradition, Mrs. Schneerson never held formal office in the Lubavitch organization, but ''she was very much behind the scenes,'' according to her husband's close aide, Rabbi Yehudah Krinsky.         ''In her quiet behind-the-scenes way, she was involved in every activity of Lubavitch,'' he said.         Surviving are her husband and a sister, Hannah Gourary.       
        Gladys Gilkey Calkins, a former president of the Y.W.C.A.'s of the United States, died of a respiratory ailment Tuesday at Goodwin House, a retirement home in Alexandria, Va., where she lived. She was 90 years old.         Gladys Gilkey Calkins, a former president of the Y.W.C.A.'s of the United States, died of a respiratory ailment Tuesday at Goodwin House, a retirement home in Alexandria, Va., where she lived. She was 90 years old.         She was born in Watertown, Mass., and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Cornell University. At 63, she earned a master's degree from George Washington University.         From 1932 to 1941, she served on the Y.W.C.A. board in Rochester. In 1941, she became vice president of the Y.W.C.A.'s of the United States and was the group's president from 1943 through 1949. She was vice president for North America of the World Council of Y.W.C.A.'s, and a vice president of Church Women United.         Mrs. Calkins taught at the American School in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka, and at Tunghai University in Taiwan. She is the author of ''Follow Those Women: Church Women in the Ecumenical Movement,'' published by the National Council of Churches.         She is survived by three daughters, Fay Alailima of Apia, Western Samoa; Harriet Hunter of Havertown, Pa., and Gladys Keidel of Arlington, Va., 13 grandchildren and 17 great-grandchildren.       
        Camilla Ravera, a founder of the Communist Party in Italy and a champion of women's rights who became the first woman elected to the Italian Senate, died Thursday at her Rome apartment, her family reported. She was 98 years old.         Camilla Ravera, a founder of the Communist Party in Italy and a champion of women's rights who became the first woman elected to the Italian Senate, died Thursday at her Rome apartment, her family reported. She was 98 years old.         Miss Ravera helped found the party in 1921 but was expelled in 1943 because she bitterly criticized Stalin and the nonaggression pact of 1939 between the Soviet Union and the Nazis.         She was reinstated during the 1950's and was elected to the Senate in 1982.         She was one of just nine people given the honorary title of senator for life and remained active in Italian politics through 1983.         In 1930, she was arrested for anti-Fascist activities and sentenced to 15 years in prison by a special tribunal. She served five years in jail and eight in internal exile before being freed after the Allied invasion of Italy.         In Parliament, Miss Ravera sought to extend women's rights, and she wrote a history of the women's movement in Italy.         Miss Ravera was a close friend of former President Sandro Pertini, a Socialist, who nominated her as senator for life.         A group of students visiting the presidential mansion once asked Mr. Pertini if he thought a woman could hold his post. ''Why not,'' President Pertini replied. ''One Camilla Ravera is an example.''       
        Burnita Shelton Matthews, a senior judge on the Federal District Court here and the first woman appointed to a Federal trial court, died Monday at Sibley Memorial Hospital after suffering a stroke. She was 93 years old.         Burnita Shelton Matthews, a senior judge on the Federal District Court here and the first woman appointed to a Federal trial court, died Monday at Sibley Memorial Hospital after suffering a stroke. She was 93 years old.         Judge Matthews was named to the bench by President Harry Truman in 1949 and assumed senior status in 1968, allowing her to go into semiretirement while still hearing cases.         In the 1970's, she was designated to sit on the United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. She remained active in the District Court until September 1983.         Earlier in her career, Judge Matthews had practiced law for almost 30 years and had developed a reputation as an advocate for women's rights.         One of her most notable cases was when she presided over the 1957 trial of Jimmy Hoffa, at that time the vice president of the teamsters union, on charges that he had bribed his way into the files of a Senate committee that was investigating him. A jury acquitted Mr. Hoffa.         In another celebrated case, Judge Matthews in 1955 refused to order the State Department to issue a passport to the singer and actor Paul Robeson. Mr. Robeson had been accused of membership in the Communist Party and of various activities in support of the Communist movement.         While sitting on the Court of Appeals in 1971, Judge Matthews ruled that disabled people receiving benefits from the Social Security Administration were entitled to hearings before their benefits were terminated.         President Reagan in 1984 wrote to her that ''in furthering the administration of justice in our legal system,'' her ''diligence, distinguished efforts and pioneering spirit serve as an inspiration to all.''         Judge Matthews studied law at the National University Law School, now part of George Washington Univerity, and received her degree in 1919. Her husband, retired Army Lieut. Col. Percy A. Matthews, died in 1969. She left no immediate survivors.

Stately, a co-founder of the American Indian Movement, died of cancer April 27. She was 57 years old.         Ms. Stately was chairwoman of the Minneapolis American Indian Center for several years and worked for the city of Minneapolis as a liaison with the Indian community.         While four of her children were still at home, she received her high school equivalency degree. She attended the University of Minnesota.         She is survived by six daughters, three sons, her mother, a brother, a sister and 13 grandchildren.       
        Elaine Black Yoneda, a radical labor activist during the Depression and the 1934 San Francisco general strike, died of a heart attack here on Thursday. She was 81 years old.         Elaine Black Yoneda, a radical labor activist during the Depression and the 1934 San Francisco general strike, died of a heart attack here on Thursday. She was 81 years old.         Mrs. Yoneda, known in labor circles as ''the Red Angel'' and as ''Tiger Woman'' in the Hearst newspapers because of her militancy, was the only woman on the steering committee of the 1934 San Francisco general strike, which was a response to the killing of two longshoremen participating in a West Coast walkout.         Until she retired in 1973, Mrs. Yoneda was a clerical worker for the pension fund of the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union-Pacific Maritime Association. She was a member of Local 29 of the Office and Professional Employees International Union until this year and was president of the women's auxiliary of Local 16 of the longshoremen's union. Became a Communist         She was born in New York City on Sept. 4, 1906. She moved to Los Angeles in 1931 and there joined the Communist Party. She was active with International Labor Defense, a group that worked for the legal rights of strikers and others active in the labor movement.         She met a young Japanese-American and fellow Communist named Karl Yoneda when she went to bail him out of jail, where he was being held for strike activities. They were married in 1933.         Her husband said her death came on the 55th anniversary of their wedding as they were preparing to celebrate.         Mr. Yoneda said they had remained members of the party: ''We believe in minority parties. If you let the big shots run the country, what will happen to us?'' Husband Interned in War         In 1942, after the bombing of Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt signed an order for the internment of people of Japanese ancestry. Mr. Yoneda was interned at the camp at Manzanar, Calif.         Mr. Yoneda said his wife and son remained with him until he volunteered to perform intelligence work for the United States military against the Japanese Army in Burma. Mrs. Yoneda was allowed to move with her son to San Francisco, but for the next two years she had to report monthly to military authorities on the child's whereabouts, her husband said.         In later years, she remained active in union and political work. The day before she died, she attended a longshoremen's rally for the Rev. Jesse Jackson's Presidential campaign, her husband said.         A private funeral service was held Saturday in San Francisco. In addition to her husband, Ms. Yoneda's survivors are her daughter from a previous marriage, Joyce Ebangelista, her son, Thomas Yoneda, and two grandchildren.

Miriam Gurko, an author of books for young adults, died of pneumonia July 3 at Peekskill (N.Y.) Community Hospital. She was 78 years old.         Among Mrs. Gurko's books were ''Restless Spirit: The Life of Edna St. Vincent Millay'' and ''The Ladies of Seneca Falls,'' about the early women's rights movement. Two forthcoming volumes are ''The Road to Israel,'' about Theodor Herzl, the founder of Zionism; and ''The Prisoner of Devil's Island,'' about Alfred Dreyfus, the French army officer convicted of treason and later exonerated.         Mrs. Gurko is survived by her husband, Leo, of Manhattan; a son, Stephen, of Frisco, Colo., and a daughter, Jane, of Willits, Calif.       
        Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Ellin Berlin, the novelist wife of the songwriter Irving Berlin, died early yesterday at Doctors Hospital, to which she had been taken from her Beekman Place town house after the last of a series of strokes. She was 85 years old.         Mrs. Berlin, the last of whose four novels, ''The Best of Families,'' was published in 1970, was also a prolific short-story writer and contributed several articles to The New Yorker before her marriage to Mr. Berlin on Jan. 4, 1926. Mr. Berlin observed his 100th birthday last May 11.         Their marriage was one of the most sensational social events of the 1920's, for it united the famous songwriter, an Orthodox Jew, with the former Ellin Mackay, a Roman Catholic debutante who spurned her multimillionaire father's fortune for love.         The Municipal Court wedding came after several events that made it clear that Ellin Mackay, one of the great beauties of her time, was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill society heiress.         She had all but turned her back on the exclusive so-called 400, which ruled her mother's day, choosing the new ''cafe society.'' She said she preferred the ''dizzy twenties'' to the ''dull old days'' when she was one of New York's most celebrated debutantes. Abandoning 'Polite Society'         Miss Mackay wrote what her friends called her ''saucy but amusing'' opinions in articles for The New Yorker. In one article she defended her generation's abandonment of the Junior League and ''polite society'' for the gayer life of cabarets and dancing the Charleston.         ''It is not because fashionable young ladies are picturesquely depraved that they go to cabarets,'' she wrote. ''They go to find privacy.''         That article shocked society and newspaper editorial writers, as did one that followed in The New Yorker dated Dec. 25, 1925, titled ''The Declining Function,'' in which she explained how, as a liberated young woman, she intended to seek her joys as she liked.         More portentous was her statement, ''Modern girls are conscious of their identity and they marry whom they choose, satisfied to satisfy themselves.'' Less than a month later she married the widowed Mr. Berlin, who was 15 years her senior and an immigrant Russian whose fame as a songwriter failed to impress the Mackay social circle.         The marriage so infuriated her father, Clarence Mackay, whose fortune was based in the Postal Telegragh Company, the International Telephone and Telegraph Company, mining and several other inherited interests, that he barred her from his home and threatened to disinherit her. They were not reconciled until five years later. Marriage of 62 Years         The marriage, during which Mr. Berlin wrote several songs just for her, including ''Always'' and ''The Song Is Ended,'' was a true love match and was to last 62 years.         Ellin Mackay was born March 22, 1903, on her father's $6 million estate in Roslyn, L.I. Her mother was the former Katherine Duer, a successful writer. An aunt, Alice Duer Miller, was to become the author of the long, popular World War II poem ''The White Cliffs of Dover.''         She was also a granddaughter of John W. Mackay, an Irish immigrant and one of the Nevada pioneers who made fortunes from the Comstock Lode. He parlayed his fortune into diversified business interests that made him a billionaire.         Miss Mackay was educated in private schools and took special courses at Barnard College. She was a debutante during the season of 1922-23, when her father gave her a ball at the Ritz-Carlton.         Mr. Mackay, who had been divorced in 1913, doted on little Ellin, and he took her on several trans-Atlantic crossings. Because of their close relationship, he was all the more unwilling to give his blessing to the ''unsuitable'' Mr. Berlin.  In the first few years of her marriage, Mrs. Berlin put aside her budding writing career to have a family. Their only son, Irving Berlin Jr., died in infancy, and they had three daughters. Short Stories and Novels         In 1933 she began contributing short stories to The Saturday Evening Post, The Ladies' Home Journal and other popular magazines. Her first novel, ''Land I Have Chosen,'' was published in 1944. Depicting the evils of Nazi Germany, the novel was sold to the movies for $150,000, then a record. Her other novels were ''Lace Curtain,'' 1948; ''Silver Platter,'' a 1957 semifictional account of her Nevada pioneer forebears, and ''The Best of Families.''         Mrs. Berlin was re-baptized in the Catholic faith in the 1930's, and throughout her life she worshiped at St. Patrick's Cathedral, where a funeral will be held at 2 P.M. Tuesday. She was a major supporter of the Girl Scout movement.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Berlin is survived by her daughters, Mary Ellin Barrett, of New York; Linda Louise Emmett, of Paris, and Elizabeth Irving Peters, of New York; a brother, John W. Mackay, of Locust Valley, L.I.; nine grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
        Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson. She was 88 years old and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.         Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson. She was 88 years old and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.         Known to the dance world, including hundreds of students, as Geordie Graham, she was also the director of the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance from the 1940's through the 1960's. In the 1930's, she married Winthrop Sargeant, who became the music and dance critic of The New Yorker magazine. They were divorced in the 1940's and Miss Graham devoted herself full-time to her administative duties at the school.         The youngest of the three Graham sisters who were born in Allegheny, Pa., and who moved to Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1908, Georgia followed Martha Graham into the Denishawn school in Los Angeles during World War I. Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, considered among the founders of the modern-dance movement, enlisted the teaching talents of both Graham sisters before they recognized them as performers. A Star With Denishawn Troupe         Mr. Shawn nonetheless made Martha Graham a star in his Aztec ballet, ''Xochitl,'' only to see her leave the company in 1922. Georgia Graham, however, danced with the Denishawn Dancers until 1928, sometimes performing in the roles created by Miss St. Denis or her sister. The latter included ''Revolutionary Etude'' and the title role in 'Xochitl.'' According to a fellow Denishawn dancer, Jane Sherman, Georgia Graham stopped the show in that production.         She was a senior member of the Denishawn company on its widespread tour of Asia in 1925-26 and its transcontinental American tour in 1926-27. She also toured with the Denishawn troupe when it became part of the Ziegfeld Follies in 1928. Miss Graham was a dancer in 1931 in the early, all-female Martha Graham Dance Group. In 1933, she appeared in a theatrical production directed by Martha Graham, ''Six Miracle Plays.''         She is survived by her sister.       
        Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         Lois Burnham Wilson, a founder of the Al-Anon Family Groups, whose members are relatives and friends of alcoholics, died yesterday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. Mrs. Wilson, widely known as Lois W., was 97 years old and was a longtime resident of Bedford Hills, N.Y.         As Lois W., she was revered as ''the first lady of Al-Anon,'' and as a living reminder of the beginnings five decades ago of the Alcoholics Anonymous self-help movement.         Al-Anon members help one another and themselves to deal with personal problems by speaking about them -''sharing their experience, strength and hope,'' as they like to say - at group meetings. They also help each other on a one-to-one basis, and they read the movement's many inspirational pamphlets and books. Thousands of Groups Formed         An executive on the staff of the Al-Anon Family Group headquarters in Manhattan, where Mrs. Wilson's death was announced yesterday, said 30,000 groups - including several thousand Alateen groups for the teen-age children of alcoholics - are in operation.         The executive, who in accordance with Al-Anon policy declined to give her name, said more than 20,000 of the groups were in the United States and Canada, with groups in about 100 other nations. She estimated worldwide membership of Al-Anon at about 500,000.         In the 1930's, Mrs. Wilson - a spirited, small woman with lively brown eyes - stuck by her alcoholic husband, William G. Wilson, who had become a self-described ''hanger-on in Wall Street.'' She hoped he would manage to stop drinking for good.         Mr. Wilson did, and in 1935 he became a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous. One of its groups flourished in the Wilsons' home, then an apartment at 182 Clinton Street in Brooklyn. Since those early days, Alcoholics Anonymous has grown to an international membership of more than 1.5 million. Known within that organization as Bill W., Mr. Wilson died in 1971. A Time of Discontent         After Alcoholics Anonymous was founded, Mrs. Wilson became discontented. ''It seemed I saw nothing of the man I had tried to help,'' she later recalled.         ''He was always with his A.A. cronies'' who helped him to resist alcohol, she said, adding that ''I guess I was jealous and resentful that these strangers had done for him what I could not do.''         A turning point for her came one day when, as she said, ''I threw my shoe at him as hard as I could.''         ''I was so ashamed of myself,'' she said, ''that I went out and walked around the block several times. I soon had to admit that I needed some therapy myself.''         Mrs. Wilson, who was not an alcoholic, began applying to herself the same self-help principles that her husband and his Alcoholics Anonymous friends were using.         ''I shared my experience with other relatives of alcoholics, and we began to hold informal meetings,'' she said. ''We did not discuss our alcoholic relatives, but tried to straighten out our own lives. This attitude became basic to Al-Anon.'' Two Separate Organizations         Though Al-Anon is in many ways patterned on Alcoholics Anonymous, the two organizations are organizationally separate. Both groups are self-supporting; they do not accept funds from nonmembers. Members of both groups are supposed to maintain anonymity in the news media - which is why Mrs. Wilson and her husband were widely known only by their first names.         Mrs. Wilson was said never to have voiced blanket condemnation of the drinking of alcoholic beverages, affirming that she opposed ''only the disease of alcoholism and the damage it does to a family.''         She was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of a physician. She graduated from the Packer Collegiate Institute in Brooklyn, worked in a Y.W.C.A. and taught school in Short Hills, N.J., before her marriage to Mr. Wilson in 1918. After her marriage she worked for a time as an occupational therapist, wrote magazine articles and worked as a Macy's sales clerk.         After Mrs. Wilson and other alcoholics' relatives began their meetings, similar self-help discussion groups for members of alcoholics' families were founded elsewhere in the United States during the 1940's. In 1951, Mrs. Wilson, along with a friend and Westchester County neighbor, Anne B., set up a central information center for these groups. The center was initially in her Westchester home. First Alateen Group         Not long afterward, the center moved into offices in Manhattan, and the movement took the name Al-Anon Family Groups. In 1957, the first Alateen self-help group was set up, in California, for young people with alcoholism in their families.         Mrs. Wilson remained active and prominent in Al-Anon into the 1980's, traveling on its behalf and appearing at and addressing Al-Anon gatherings. At the first international convention of Al-Anon, in 1985 in Montreal, an audience of 45,000 -members of Alcoholics Anonymous as well as Al-Anon - gave her a standing ovation.         Mrs. Wilson wrote an autobiography, ''Lois Remembers,'' first published in 1979.         There are no immediate survivors. Funeral arrangements have not yet been set.

Andersen, a faith healer and co-founder of the Community of Jesus, a residential religious community based in Orleans, Mass., died of heart failure in her sleep on Wednesday at her home in Orleans. She was 75 years old.         Mrs. Andersen, known in the community as Mother Cay, and Judy H. Sorensen, both lay members of the Episcopal Church, founded the community 30 years ago in an effort to bring about reconciliation among the various Christian denominations and to develop healing as a way of life.         The ecumenical community of 300 adults and children, as well as 500 nonresident members, includes among its residents 12 members of the clergy from five denominations.         The community also has become a focal point for religious music, in particular a movement to preserve the Gregorian chant, an ancient form of worship, in collaboration with Benedictine monks and nuns in France.         Earlier this year Mrs. Andersen and Mrs. Sorensen had an audience with Pope John Paul II in recognition of their spiritual work.         Mrs. Andersen was born in East Weymouth, Mass., and atttended the Vesper George Art School in Boston.         She is survived by her husband, John W. Andersen.       
        Jennie Lee, a Scottish coal miner's daughter who rose to became a Labor Party Member of Parliament, Minister of State for the Arts and a baroness, died Wednesday at her home in London, a friend, Lord Goodman, said Thursday. She was 84 years old.         Jennie Lee, a Scottish coal miner's daughter who rose to became a Labor Party Member of Parliament, Minister of State for the Arts and a baroness, died Wednesday at her home in London, a friend, Lord Goodman, said Thursday. She was 84 years old.         The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.         Baroness Lee of Asheridge, as she was known after being made a life peer in 1970, held a seat in Parliament for 27 years. She was a member of the Labor Party's national executive from 1958 to 1970 and served as party chairman in 1967 and 1968.         The present leader of the party, Neil Kinnock, on Thursday recalled her as ''a woman of brilliance and vision, a great socialist, who inspired so many and was loved by all who knew her warmth and passion for justice.''         Given special responsibility for the arts in 1965 by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, she played a crucial political role in starting the Open University, which provided higher education by correspondence, over radio and television and at evening classes to many students who had had no other university-level studies. Lesson for a Teacher         Her lifelong concern for the underprivileged was sharpened by her experience while teaching for two years in the late 1920's in a village near Lochgelly in Fifeshire, eastern Scotland.         ''I did not believe that there was any good reason why either the children or myself should come to terms with life as we found it in that bleak mining village,'' she wrote in her volume of memoirs ''This Great Journey.''         ''Most of the misery I saw around me in school, in the streets, and in private homes, had its roots in the poverty of the place,'' she said. ''I did not see how, within the four walls of a classroom, I could ever hope to change any of that.''         She ran successfully for Parliament and represented a Scottish district from 1929 until she lost the seat in 1931. She represented another district, near the industrial city of Birmingham in England, from 1945 until losing that seat in a general election in 1970. She then automatically acquired a seat in the House of Lords on being elevated to the peerage.         A New York Times editorial commented at the time: ''How Scotland's fiery Jennie would have scorned the robes of a baroness early in her Labor Party career!'' Married to Bevan         She was born Janet Lee on Nov. 3, 1904 in Lochgelly. Her father, James Lee, was active in the trade union movement. Her paternal grandfather, Michael Lee, won renown in the movement, rising to be a member of the Scottish Miners' Executive.         Lady Lee was married in 1934 to Aneurin Bevan, a prominent Labor Party figure who was known as Nye. A former coal miner, he was a elected to Parliament in 1929 and remained a Member of Parliament for 31 years, serving as Minister of Health from 1945 to 1951. He died in 1960.         After Jennie Lee was elected to Parliament from Staffordshire in 1945, and Mr. Bevan was re-elected to Parliament in the same elections, they became known as ''Britain's first man-and-wife parliamentary team.''         Lady Lee, who held degrees from the University of Edinburgh, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Cambridge University. Her books included ''My Life with Nye,'' published in 1980, in addition to ''This Great Journey,'' which was published in the United States in 1942 after appearing first in Britain.         Lady Lee and Mr. Bevan had no children, and she has no survivors.
