Louise March, a founder of the Rochester Folk Art Guild, a nonprofit artisan's collective farm in Middlesex, N.Y., died of a heart attack yesterday at the Soldiers and Sailors Hospital in Penn Yan, N.Y. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan and Middlesex.         Mrs. March, who was born in Switzerland and grew up in Germany, came to the United States country in 1926 as an exchange student. Shortly afterward, she received a master's degree in art history from Smith College. Not long after, she managed an art gallery in Manhattan for the late photographer Alfred Stieglitz.         She was a student and translator of the late philosopher, G. I. Gurdjieff.         In 1957, she and some friends established the Rochester Folk Art Guild in that city. The name followed them when, in 1967, they moved 50 miles south to establish the farm in Middlesex, in the Finger Lakes region. She continued to direct the Guild's work over the next 30 years.         Her husband, Walter F. March, an architect, died in 1969. She is survived by two sons, George of Paoli, Pa., and John of Boulder, Colo; three daughters, Sophia von der Heide of Manhattan, Trita Shortt of Fairfax, Va., and Sylvia March Fitzgerald of Palisades, N.Y.; a sister, Maria Lennig of Frankfurt, and eleven grandchildren.

She was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan and Rockport, Mass.         Miss Coit attained prominence in 1941 with the publication of her report ''Notes on the Design and Construction of the Dwelling Unit for the Low-Income Family.'' The report showed how low-income residents used their dwellings and argued that their point of view should be the primary concern in planning public housing.         In 1970, Mayor John V. Lindsay appointed Miss Coit to the Landmarks Preservation Commission and, in 1969, she received an award as a Pioneer in Architecture from the New York City chapter of the American Institute of Architects.         She is survived by a brother, Robert, of Rockport, and six nieces and nephews.
