         Evelyn Laye, a British musical comedy star whose 80-year career included appearances on Broadway, died on Saturday at a nursing home in London. She was 95.         Miss Laye made her stage debut at the age of 15 and enjoyed her first big success in "The Merry Widow" in 1923. She became an international star when she  played the lead in the 1929 Broadway production of Noel Coward's "Bitter Sweet," singing "I'll See You Again," which became her signature.         She also appeared in films, among them "The Night is Young" (1934), "Evensong" (1934), "Make Mine a Million" (1959), "Theater of Death" (1966), "Say Hello to Yesterday" (1970) and "Second Star to the Right" (1980).         In 1992 she made a farewell tour in Britain and was honored in a gala at the  London Palladium.         Her marriage to Sonnie Hale, an actor, ended in divorce. Her second husband,  Frank Lawton, an actor, died in 1969.       
         Rhoda Haas Goldman, a San Francisco civic leader and benefactor of a wide variety of causes, died on Saturday while vacationing in Honolulu. She was 71.         She suffered a heart attack, said Duane Silverstein, executive director of the Richard and Rhoda Goldman Fund in San Francisco.         Over the past five years the fund has contributed some $25 million in grants to cultural and environmental causes. She and her husband, Richard, also established the Goldman Environmental Prize in 1990 to reward grass-roots environmentalists around the world.         Mrs. Goldman, a San Francisco native and graduate of the University of California at Berkeley, was a vice president and past president of the San Francisco Symphony and chairwoman of her city's Memorial to the Six Million Victims of the Holocaust. She was a director of the Mount Zion Health System and former president of the Mount Zion Hospital and Medical Center.         A great-grandniece and heir of Levi Strauss, the denim king, she was a corporate director of his apparel concern, Levi Strauss & Company.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Goldman's survivors include two sons, John D., of Atherton, Calif., and Douglas E., of San Francisco; a daughter, Susan R. Gelman  of Chevy Chase, Md.; a brother, Peter E. Haas Sr., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Dr. Francesca Morosani Thompson, a prominent orthopedic surgeon at Roosevelt  Hospital who chronicled her struggle against cancer of the bone marrow in a book, "Going for the Cure," died on Thursday at New York Hospital. A resident of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, she was 51.         She was a partner in Orthopaedic Associates of New York. Besides serving as an attending physician at Roosevelt, she was the chief of the Adult Orthopaedic  Foot Clinic of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center; a co-director of the Combined Foot and Ankle Fellowship at the Hospital for Special Surgery, and a clinical assistant professor of orthopedics at Columbia University's College of  Physicians and Surgeons.         Dr. Thompson was born in Litchfield, Conn., and graduated from Smith College in 1965. She took up her medical training after the birth of her two children and graduated from Cornell University Medical College in 1977. She was vice president of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society and a fellow of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery.         Her cancer of the bone marrow was diagnosed in 1987, when she became the first victim of multiple myeloma to undergo an autologous bone-marrow transplant. In that procedure, the patient's own bone marrow is withdrawn for radiation treatment and chemotherapy and put back into the body.         Her book, written for patients and their families, was published by St. Martin's Press in 1989. She donated the proceeds to a foundation she created for the purpose, the Cure Myeloma Fund. The International Myeloma Foundation, which supports research into the disease, issued a paperback reprint in 1993, and a Braille version remains in print as well.         Dr. Thompson is survived by her husband, James E.; a daughter, Heather R. Cavalli of Miami; a son, James E., also of Manhattan; her mother, Virginia W. Morosani of Litchfield; two sisters, Virginia Smith of Mill Neck, L.I., and Roopa Morosani of Menlo Park, Calif., and three brothers, George Morosani of Ashville, N.C., Reto Morosani of Litchfield and John Morosani of Manhattan.       
         Jill Rose, the president of the International Center of Photography, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 52 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Marshall Rose, the chairman emeritus of the New York Public Library.         Mrs. Rose, who was active in many civic and cultural affairs, was elected to  the International Center of Photography's board of trustees in 1981 and became the board's president in 1989. She was involved in the renovation of the organization's headquarters on Fifth Avenue at East 94th Street.         Cornell Capa, the founding director emeritus of the center, remembered that whatever Mrs. Rose decided to do, "she did it with a full heart and elegance."         Mrs. Rose was born in Brooklyn and brought up in Great Neck, L.I. She graduated from Ohio State University in 1964, and received a master's degree in  social work at Hunter College in 1993. She was a social worker with the Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children on a volunteer basis until shortly before her death.         She was married in 1965 to Mr. Rose, the chief executive officer of the Georgetown Group, a privately held real estate and financial service group.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Rose is survived by her father, Nathan Kupin of Great Neck, L.I.; a daughter, Wendi Rose of New York; a son, Andrew Rose of Santa Monica, Calif., and a sister, Barbara Lembo of New York.       
         Dorothy Maynor, a highly regarded soprano recitalist who founded the Harlem School of the Arts, died on Monday at the Chester County Hospital in West Chester, Pa. She was 85 and lived in Kennett Square, Pa.         Miss Maynor, whose career helped open the way for black artists like Marian Anderson and Leontyne Price, possessed a voice that the New Grove Dictionary of  American Music describes as "a soaring, belllike soprano capable of exquisite musical effects, supported by a sincere and ardent temperament." She took New York by storm in a sold-out recital at Town Hall in 1939 and pursued a successful recital career.         Although she committed more than 100 operatic roles to memory, she never appeared on an opera stage; there were no such opportunities for a black artist  in the late 1930's and the 1940's, when she was in her prime. (Miss Anderson, the first black singer to appear at the Metropolitan Opera, did not make her debut there until 1955.)         Miss Maynor was born in Norfolk, Va., and as a child she sang in the choir of her father's church. She entered Hampton Institute (now Hampton University) in Hampton, Va., intending to become a teacher of home economics, but she also joined the renowned Hampton Choir, with which she toured Europe in 1929. On the  advice of the choir director, R. Nathaniel Dett, she changed her major to music  and earned a bachelor's degree in 1933.         After being awarded a scholarship, she studied choir direction at the Westminster Choir College in Princeton, N.J., where she received a second bachelor's degree in music and choral conducting in 1935. While on tour in New England with the school's choir, she was encouraged by several wealthy benefactors to pursue a concert career. Three years of private study in New York followed, with Wilfried Klamroth and John Alan Haughton. At this time she changed the spelling of her name from Mainor.         After hearing her sing at the 1939 Berkshire Symphonic Festival at Tanglewood in western Massachusetts, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky reportedly jumped up  and down, shouting: "It is a miracle! It is a musical revelation! The world must hear her!" Koussevitzky, who called Miss Maynor "a native Flagstad," immediately used her in recordings with the Boston Symphony Orchestra.         She made her formal debut at Town Hall in Manhattan later that year, on Nov.  19, in a widely anticipated event that was sold out more than a week in advance. Olin Downes, reviewing the concert for The New York Times, hailed her as "one of the most remarkable soprano voices of the rising generation," called her voice "phenomenal for its range, character and varied expressive resources."         Miss Maynor began touring extensively in the United States, often appearing as a soloist with leading orchestras. She made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1940 with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by John Barbirolli. In the late 40's she toured Latin America and Europe. She often performed at benefits to aid the  war effort and black causes.         She sang at the Presidential Inaugural galas for Harry S. Truman in 1949 and  Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1953. In 1952, by special permission of the Daughters of the American Revolution, she appeared as a soloist with the National Symphony Orchestra at Constitution Hall in the first commercial appearance there by a black artist since Miss Anderson had been barred from performing at the hall in  1939. (Miss Anderson subsequently gave benefit performances at the hall.)         Miss Maynor recorded popular arias and songs for RCA Victor. Although she never appeared on the opera stage, she recorded the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" under Arturo Toscanini.         In 1963, she retired to work with her husband, the Rev. Shelby Rooks, at St.  James Presbyterian Church at West 141st Street and St. Nicholas Avenue in Harlem, where he was pastor. That year she founded the Harlem School of the Arts. The school offered classes in music, ballet, modern dance, drama and art to poor children for minimal fees, sometimes as little as 50 cents a lesson, and lent or rented instruments to students who did not own one.         "In most schools, if you don't have a piano, you can't take lessons," Miss Maynor told one interviewer. "But we say, 'Good, you come here and practice.' "  She served as executive director of the school until 1979 and also taught there. In 1977 she raised more than $2 million to build a new facility for the school,  which originally served 20 children and now has more than 1,000 students.         "What I dream of is changing the image held by the children," she said on another occasion. "We've made them believe everything beautiful is outside the community. We would like them to make beauty in our community."         Her work with the school is recounted in "Dorothy Maynor and the Harlem School of the Arts: The Diva and the Dream" (Edwin Mellen Press, 1993), by William F. Rogers Jr.         She received honorary doctorates from many schools, including Howard University, Westminster Choir College, Oberlin College, Carnegie-Mellon University and Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C..         In 1975, she became the first black member of the Metropolitan Opera board.         She is survived by her husband.         Correction:  March 2, 1996, Saturday         An obituary last Saturday about the soprano Dorothy Maynor credited her with  one recording incorrectly. She did not record the role of Leonore in "Fidelio" with Toscanini.       
         Katrina de Hirsch, a speech therapist who was a pioneer in the field of childhood language and learning disorders, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Ms. de Hirsch, who was better known by her professional name than her legal name, Katherine Romney, was among the first researchers to call attention to the varied deficiencies that make up speech and learning disabilities.         In the mid-1960's, long before interest in dyslexia, stuttering and similar  problems became widespread, Ms. de Hirsch was writing articles for professional  journals on these topics, said Dr. Jeannette Jansky, a colleague for many years.         Ms. de Hirsch maintained a private practice in New York City and was director of the Pediatric Language Disorder Clinic at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center from 1941 to 1972. One colleague described her as a master clinician who  achieved insights into children based not only on formal testing but on observations of a child's personality and an estimation of the relationships with family and friends.         "She was a pioneer," Dr. Jansky said. "The whole field of learning disabilities did not exist when she started her practice. When she started her work, the fields of reading disorders and language disorders were not connected. But she always said reading disorders had their base in language.         "Children with delayed language development had problems with reading when they got older. Once we had polished off their language problems, they came back in a year or two with reading disorders. She came to believe that the problems were rooted in architectural differences in the cortex."         The two women devised an index to predict whether a kindergarten pupil was likely to succeed in school or to need remedial work. It formed the basis for their first book, "Predicting Reading Failure" (1966, Harper & Row), written with Dr. William Langford. A second book, "Preventing Reading Failure" (1972, Harper & Row), refined the process and focused on intervention.         In her clinical work, Ms. de Hirsch put into practice the idea that both children and their parents needed to be educated about the needs of learning-disabled pupils.         "She explained to the parents why the children were having the problems they  were having," Dr. Jansky said. "If a child misread an easy word, it looked like  carelessness. But she explained that they didn't see it. She taught them tolerance and parental support rather than criticism. The emphasis in diagnosis  was always to highlight the children's often very special talents."         In addition to her private practice, Ms. de Hirsch carried out research and wrote extensively. She also trained pediatric and psychiatric residents to recognize language problems.         A life fellow of the American Orthopsychiatric Association, Ms. de Hirsch was an honoree of the Orton Society, named after Dr. Samuel Orton, an early mentor of Ms. de Hirsch. She was a founder of the society, now called the Orton Dyslexia Society. She was a fellow of the British College of Speech Therapy and  the American Speech-Language Hearing Association.         Born in Stuttgart, Germany, Ms. de Hirsch got her training at the West End Hospital for Nervous Diseases in London, where she received a degree from the College of Speech Therapy. In 1941, she came to the United States, where Teachers College of Columbia University awarded her a bachelor's degree.         She was married three times, and became a baroness by marrying her second husband, Donald von Hirsch.  Her third husband, Alfred Romney, whom she married  in 1948, died in 1977.         She is survived by two sons, Andrew von Hirsch of Cambridge, England, and Vinal Haven, Maine, and Frank Weil of Washington; two stepsons, Andrew Romney of Manhattan and Henry Romney of Remsenburg, L.I., and four grandchildren.       
         Anna Mikhailovna Larina, the widow of Nikolai I. Bukharin, a father of the Bolshevik Revolution who was executed under Stalin, and herself a survivor of the Soviet gulag, died of lung cancer here on Saturday, her daughter, Nadezhda Fadeyeva, said. She was 82.         When Bukharin, a trusted comrade of Lenin and a rival to Stalin, was condemned in 1938 in the last of the Moscow show trials, his young wife was banished and spent 20 years in exile and Soviet prison camps. Before they were separated, Bukharin instructed his wife to memorize his final testament, in which he implored future generations of Communist leaders to exonerate him. Not  daring to write it down, she later recalled, she used to lull herself to sleep in prison by repeating her husband's words silently to herself "like a prayer."  It was not published in full until 1988.         Miss Larina's autobiography, "This I Cannot Forget," created a sensation when it was published in Russia in 1988 as part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rehabilitation of Bukharin. But long before, while she was still in exile, Miss  Larina waged a tireless campaign to exonerate her husband after Stalin's death,  writing long, detailed letters to Nikita Khrushchev and his successors demanding Bukharin's reinstatement in the pantheon of revolutionary heroes.         Miss Larina's book was an instant best-seller. A harrowing prison memoir as well as a loving, uncritical tribute to Bukharin, it is also one of the few first-person accounts of repression and prison life by a fallen member of the Bolshevik ruling elite. Miss Larina was the adopted daughter of a leading Communist revolutionary, Yuri Larin, and grew up in the Metropole Hotel, the residence of many Soviet leaders, dandled on the knee of Lenin. She had known Bukharin, who was 25 years older than she and a friend of her father's, all her  life. She was 16 when they became engaged -- Stalin hand-delivered her first love letter to Bukharin -- and 20 when they married.         She was 24 when she was sent into exile and separated from their infant son,  Yuri, whom she did not see again until he was 20. The boy was passed around by relatives and later raised in a state orphanage. He only learned who his father  was in 1956, when he was allowed to visit his mother in exile. She was released  in 1959, and returned to Moscow with her second husband, Fyodor Fadeyev, a fellow prisoner she met in Siberia, and their two children.         Stephen F. Cohen, a Princeton University historian who published a biography  of Bukharin in 1973, met clandestinely with the widow during the Brezhnev era and became a close friend, discovering in the archives and returning to her the  last love letter Bukharin wrote to her, on Jan. 15, 1938, from prison. He was shot two months later.         Mr. Cohen described Miss Larina as "the last living link to the generation that made the revolution." He added that it was her remarkable personality that  cemented their friendship. "She lost everything," Mr. Cohen said, "but she showed no bitterness. She endured this horrible experience but it didn't deform  her psychologically. In 1988, she was able to resume public life in a way that astonished people."         After winning the campaign to rehabilitate her husband, Miss Larina devoted her last years to trying to recover Bukharin's long-hidden prison writings, philosophical essays, poems and also an autobiographical novel, which were unearthed from secret party archives in 1992. The novel is scheduled to be published in English by Columbia University Press later this year.         In addition to her daughter and her son Yuri Larin, Miss Larina is survived by her second son, Mikhail Fadeyev.       
         Esther S. Manz, who was a 208-pound housewife pregnant with her fifth child when a kitchen-table gathering in 1948 inspired her to found TOPS, a weight-loss support group that grew into a 300,000-member nonprofit organization, died on Monday at the Heritage Nursing Home in Milwaukee. Mrs. Manz, who made her home in Greenfield, Wis., a suburb of Milwaukee, was 88.         TOPS, which stands for Take Off Pounds Sensibly, draws its philosophy from something the 5-foot-2-inch Mrs. Manz, then 40, observed in group sessions intended to prepare women for childbirth: the power of mutual support in helping participants remain within their doctors' guidelines for weight.         TOPS members work out a sensible diet and weight goal with their physician and provide evidence of having consulted a doctor before attending weekly meetings that include a weigh-in and provide support and encouragement for members.         Men and women who achieve their weight goals become KOPS (Keep Off Pounds Sensibly), role models who are themselves reinforced in their efforts to maintain their weight by continuing to attend meetings.         "Life is a battle," Mrs. Manz once said. "Just let us win the one on obesity."         According to data from the weekly weigh-ins, TOPS members in 12,000 chapters  in the United States and abroad lost more than 740 tons last year, a spokeswoman said yesterday.         The nonprofit organization, based in Milwaukee, is supported by membership dues -- $16 in each of the first two years and $14 thereafter. When Mrs. Manz wrote TOPS's articles of incorporation in 1952, she committed it to finding a cure for obesity, and TOPS says it has contributed more than $4.5 million to obesity research.         After Mrs. Manz and three friends established their support group at her kitchen table in Milwaukee, the organization's name took its final form as the result of a newspaper article.         Mrs. Manz said she originally thought of it as TOP. "We didn't even have a name for our club at first, but when we went down to The Milwaukee Journal to be interviewed about our organization, the reporter asked what we called ourselves," she said in the group's handbook for new members. When the article was published, the name appeared as TOPS, and Mrs. Manz said it was later suggested that the S be made to stand for "sensibly."         On Jan. 21, 1948, the first meeting of TOPS was held at a Milwaukee community center. In the early days of the organization, Mrs. Manz carried a scale with her as she made her rounds as roving ambassador, organizing meetings.         Mrs. Manz, who achieved average proportions in her effort to control her weight, became president and chairwoman of the TOPS board in 1952. Declining health prompted her to relinquish the presidency in 1991, but she remained chairwoman until her death.         Born in 1907 in Plymouth, Wis., she grew up as Esther Schuland and graduated  in 1926 from Wisconsin State Teachers College. She taught at rural Wisconsin schools, married Gilbert Manz, a steelworker, in 1929 and later moved to Milwaukee, where she became a housewife.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Manz is survived by a son, Gilbert Jr.; four daughters, Bonnie Prieben, Maureen Weigert, Barbara Canapa and Marjory von Hof;  a brother, Carl Schuland, of Green Bay, Wis., 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. All of Mrs. Manz's children live in Milwaukee except for Mrs. von Hof, a resident of Altura, Minn.       
         One of the most elegant tennis players ever to grace a grass court, Sarah Palfrey Danzig, a mainstay on the international circuit in the 1930's and an esteemed ambassador of the game thereafter, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 83.         The cause was lung cancer, her husband, Jerry A. Danzig, said.         In addition to being active in the Boston social registry from the 1930's to the 50's, she and her four sisters all claimed national tennis titles at varying points of their lives. But she was the only member of the brood who continued to have a significant impact on the tennis scene upon making the transition from junior to the adult ranks.         In all, Danzig collected 18 Grand Slam titles, most of them in doubles where, because of her uncommon artistry around the net, she was a coveted partner in women's as well as mixed doubles competitions. And her beatific courtside manner made her a favorite with spectators in the United States and abroad, where she garnered 24 titles.         Danzig was born in Sharon, Mass., on Sept. 18, 1912. Early on, she received the attention and instruction of Hazel Hotchkiss Wightman, the progenitor of the international Wightman Cup competition between teams from the United States and  Britain, and a front-runner in making the volley an essential component of women's tennis.         As a result of that association, Danzig not only excelled at the net, but she was also selected to be a member of 10 Wightman Cup teams. Her doubles partners  there -- Helen Jacobs, Helen Wills Moody and Alice Marble -- constituted a veritable Who's Who of women's tennis.         The United States National champion in singles in 1941 and again in 1945, Danzig ranked among the world's top 10 women on six occasions between 1933 and '39. She was the United States doubles champion nine times and captured the Wimbledon doubles title, alongside the equally glamorous Marble, in 1938 and '39.         Danzig rose to prominence on the national scene as a teen-ager. At 14, she won the Junior Grass Court Doubles in 1927 and she began dominating both singles and doubles junior events the following year. By the time she acquired her last  amateur national title in 1945 at a doubles clay-court championship where her partner was Elwood Cooke, the second of her three husbands, Danzig possessed a total of 63 national titles.         "Sarah certainly had all the elements of grace and charm and played a very stylish game," said Virginia Wade, the 1977 Wimbledon champion, who benefited from Danzig's support while still a rookie. "She always treated newcomers to the game as if they were one of the family, and she was a wonderful role model,"         Danzig briefly turned professional in 1947 for an exhibition tour with Pauline Betz before switching her attention to a business career in which she also thrived. Besides performing charitable duties on a revolving list of social committees, Danzig worked for NBC television as a sports editor from 1956 to '57, and in 1965 became an advertising consultant for World Tennis magazine.         Her method for attracting advertising to the magazine was unique and ahead of its time. Instead of wooing corporate clients with the traditional martini luncheon, the health-conscious Danzig booked weekly court time at a mid-Manhattan facility and supervised vigorous tennis matches among writers, editors and business executives. She herself played recreational tennis well into her 70's.         The author of two instructional tennis books, "Winning Tennis and How to Play It" (1946) and "Tennis for Anyone" (1966), Danzig was elected to the sport's Hall of Fame in 1963. This year, a permanent exhibit in her honor will be incorporated into its collection.         She is survived by her husband and two children, Diana Dupont of Hudson, N.H., and Jerry P., of New York, and two sisters, Polly Woodrow of San Jose, Calif., and Joanna Brown of Canton, Mass.       
         Sadie Klingenstein Klau, who was an active member on the boards of Montefiore Medical Center and Hunter College, her alma mater, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. She was 97 and lived on the Upper East Side of  Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter Felice K. Shea, a Justice of the New York State Supreme Court.         For more than four decades, Mrs. Klau served as a volunteer with the auxiliary at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was executive vice chairwoman and secretary of the Board of Trustees. She also worked in the library, which now bears her name. She was introduced to the Medical Center in 1952 by her late husband, David W. Klau, a businessman who was a trustee.         A native of New York, Mrs. Klau graduated from Hunter College in 1919 with a bachelor of arts degree in French. Over the years, she developed strong ties to  the school, becoming a member of the college's Hall of Fame and receiving honorary medals and degrees. She was also a member of the Board of Governors at  Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion.         In addition to Justice Shea, Mrs. Klau is survived by two other daughters, Lucille K. Carothers of Cincinnati and Paula K. Oppenheim of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, James D. Klau of San Juan; a brother, Dr. Percy Klingenstein of New York City; 13 grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren.       
         Audrey Meadows, whose portrayal of a working-class housewife on "The Honeymooners" placed her in the pantheon of television comedy's grandes dames, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 71.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, the actress Jayne Meadows.         Audrey Meadows was the second actress to play Alice Kramden, whose bus driver husband, Ralph, threatened her weekly with a fist-propelled trip to the moon. "The Honeymooners" began in 1951 as part of "Cavalcade of Stars" with Pert Kelton as Alice. When it became part of "The Jackie Gleason Show" on CBS, Miss Meadows took over the role. "The Honeymooners" became a series on its own in 1955, and was initially something of a flop, running for only 39 episodes instead of the 70-plus that were planned. It was only later that the series, which is still being replayed on cable and airline flights, became what the television business calls a classic.         Miss Meadows's route to the role of Alice was decidedly circuitous. She was born in 1922 in China, where her father, Francis James Meadows Cotter, was an Episcopal minister. He brought the family back to the United States five years later and eventually become rector of Christ Church in Sharon, Conn.         Miss Meadows began her career as a coloratura soprano, making her concert debut at 16 in Carnegie Hall. It was her sister, Jayne, two years older, who steered her into acting.         Things moved quickly. After a World War II stint for the U.S.O. that included Mike Todd's production of "Mexican Hayride," Miss Meadows joined "The Bob and Ray Show" on NBC Television in 1951, playing all the female roles and ducking below the camera's eye to change costumes. At one point, she sang an opera aria  standing on her head.         In her spare time, she played the lead opposite Phil Silvers for 15 weeks in  the Broadway production of "Top Banana." And then she heard that Jackie Gleason, a hot new name in television, was looking for someone to replace Miss Kelton, who was ill, as Alice on his variety show.         The subsequent story is right out of the legends cherished in show business.  Gleason took one look at Miss Meadows and dismissed her as too young and too pretty. Hiring a photographer, she went home, washed off her makeup, got into a  frumpy housedress and sent the photos to Gleason, who hired her without even hearing her read lines.         During the life of "The Jackie Gleason Show," Miss Meadows appeared in different guises, including a sophisticated girlfriend of the character Reggie Van Gleason.         When Gleason decided he had had enough of an hourlong show every week, the pieces for a new half-hour show were in place: Gleason as Ralph Kramden; Miss Meadows as Alice; Art Carney as Ed Norton, and Joyce Randolph as his wife, Trixie.         No matter what else they did, each performer would forever after be fixed in  the public mind as the perfect embodiment of these hilarious and touching working-class characters whose problems seemed to connect with all of America. Each episode was a compact morality play. Ralph could keep on saying: "One of these days, Alice. Pow! Right in the kisser." But the audience knew he'd wind up admitting, "Baby you're the greatest!"         Miss Meadows held her own by remaining the calm sarcastic center around which the brilliant physical comedy of Gleason and Carney swirled. Listening to Ralph's harebrained get-rich schemes, Alice would stand with arms folded and eyes disdainful. More than once, Gleason publicly praised her ability to ad-lib  and keep the sketch on course. Once when Ralph burned himself and screamed, "Isn't there any lard around here," Miss Meadows simply took a long look at Gleason and said, "About 300 pounds of it."         The performance was perhaps too good. In a business notorious for typecasting, Miss Meadows quickly discovered that every producer wanted to keep  her in the kitchen. As recently as last year, in a New York Times interview with Bryan Miller, she lamented that she was lucky back then to get guest shots on the Dinah Shore and Red Skelton shows.         She virtually retired from acting after her 1961 marriage to Robert Six, the  chairman of Continental Airlines, turning her attention to business activities and her family. But she did have a recurring role as Ted Knight's mother-in-law  on the 1980's sitcom "Too Close for Comfort."         Mr. Six died in 1986.         Miss Meadows was adamant in her praise of Gleason, who died in 1987. After several less-than-flattering biographies were published about "The Great One," Miss Meadows wrote, with Joe Daly, her own "Love, Alice: My Life as a Honeymooner." She called the book, which was published last year, "a love letter...to my television husband Ralph Kramden."         Miss Meadows, a woman of loyalty and dignity, continued to be beset by autograph-seeking fans in restaurants and department stores. Alice had become a beloved fixture in American pop culture. People still wanted to tell her that  "Baby, you're the greatest."       
         Sadie Klingenstein Klau, who was an active member on the boards of Montefiore Medical Center and Hunter College, her alma mater, died on Saturday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City. She was 97 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter Felice K. Shea, a justice of the New York State Supreme Court.         For more than four decades, Mrs. Klau served as a volunteer with the auxiliary at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was executive vice chairwoman and secretary of the Board of Trustees. She also worked in the library, which now bears her name. She was introduced to the Medical Center in 1952 by her late husband, David W. Klau, a businessman who was a trustee.         A native of New York, Mrs. Klau graduated from Hunter College in 1919 with a  bachelor of arts degree in French. Over the years, she developed strong ties to  the school, becoming a member of the college's Hall of Fame and receiving honorary medals and degrees. She was also a member of the board of governors at  Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion.         In addition to Justice Shea, Mrs. Klau is survived by two other daughters, Lucille K. Carothers of Cincinnati and Paula K. Oppenheim of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, James D. Klau of San Juan, P.R.; a brother, Dr. Percy Klingenstein of New York City; 13 grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren.       
         Adele Bishop, who was instrumental in reviving the popularity of decorative stencils in the United States, died on Jan. 30 at Lenoir Memorial Hospital in Kinston, N.C. She was 68 and lived in Greenville, N.C.         The cause of death was complications from a bone marrow transplant while she  was being treated for cancer, said a son, Christian Carone.         Miss Bishop once hoped to become an opera singer. But stenciling, an early American art form, became the focus of her life in the 1950's after she read a book about it and began reproducing some designs at her home in East Hampton, L.I., where she lived with her first husband, Nicholas Carone, an artist.         From that start, she built a custom stenciling business, adding a partner, Cile Lord, in 1960. Together they produced stencil kits designed for do-it-yourselfers and wrote "The Art of Decorative Stenciling" (Viking, 1976), a book that was a standard reference work for many years.         After moving to Vermont in 1970 with her second husband, John Callaway, Miss  Bishop opened a mail-order company, American Decorative Arts Inc., a name changed later to Adele Bishop Inc. In 1984, Wall Lenk Corporation acquired the business and moved it to Kinston. Until her death, Miss Bishop remained active as a designer and consultant.         Miss Bishop was born in Washington, N.C., on Feb. 4, 1927. She studied voice  at the Juilliard School in New York, as well as in France and Italy.         Besides her son Christian, she is survived by her husband, Robert T. Paul of  Greenville, and another son, Claude Carone of Claverack, N.Y.       
         Alice Ehrenfeld Weil, the first American woman to hold the rank of Assistant  Secretary General at the United Nations, died on Wednesday at her home in New York. She was 70 years old and lived for most of her life on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, a family member said.         As Assistant Secretary General for General Services from 1984 until her retirement in 1986, Mrs. Weil was the highest-ranking American woman to serve at the United Nations. Only a handful of women have held senior positions at the organization.         In her post Mrs. Weil supervised the security and maintenance of United Nations centers throughout the world, as well as procurement for all field operations, the management of United Nations commercial activities, and global purchasing and transportation.         She was born in New York City in 1925. After attending public schools in New  York, she received a bachelor of arts degree in 1945 from Smith College and a doctor of laws degree in 1947 from Yale Law School.         Mrs. Weil worked in the General Counsel's office of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, and with what is now the Washington law firm of Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson before joining the United Nations in 1952, rising to the post of director of the world body's General Legal Division in 1980.         Mrs. Weil was married in 1958 to Ira Weil. Besides her husband, Mrs. Weil is  survived by two sons, Eric, of Arlington, Mass., and Jonathan, of Taunton, Mass.; a daughter, Ann Weil Richards, of Alstead, N.H., and a brother, Robert Ehrenfeld, of New York City.       
         Bernice Lotwin Bernstein, a former New York regional director of the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare, died on Wednesday at the Group Health Hospital in Seattle. She was 87 and had moved to Seattle from the Upper East Side of Manhattan eight months ago.         She was appointed director of Region 2, which covered New York and New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, in 1966. She was responsible for evaluating H.E.W. programs in her jurisdiction of 30 million people.         She also supervised the operations of the Health Services and Mental Health  Administration, the Social Security Administration, the Office of Education, the Social and Rehabilitation Service, the Office of Child Development and the Food  and Drug Administration.         Mrs. Bernstein retired as director in 1977 and worked as a special assistant  to Secretary Joseph A. Califano Jr. for more than a year longer.         From then until her death, she served as a director of the Non-Governmental Committee on Aging at the United Nations.         She was a past president of the Federal Business Association in New York and  chairman of the Federal Regional Council. She was active in the National Council of Jewish Women as a member of the national board and executive committee and national treasurer.         Born in Menomonie, Wis., she was a philosophy graduate of the University of Wisconsin, from which she received a doctorate in 1932 from the Law School. She  took up public service the next year as an attorney for the National Recovery Administration.         Mrs. Bernstein is survived by three daughters, Elinor B. Balka of Forest Hills, Queens, Kate L. Bernstein of Manhattan, and Anne L. Bernstein of Seattle; a sister, Alice Lotwin of Peoria, Ill., and three grandchildren. Her husband of  52 years, Bernard, died in 1990.       
         Susan K. Kamen, an engineer for the military and, in a second career, a vice  president at the New York Life Insurance Company, died last Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Mrs. Kamen, who also maintained a home in Wainscott, L.I., was 59.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Harry P. Kamen, the chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company.         Mrs. Kamen graduated from Smith College in 1957 and from Yale with a master's degree in science and physics in 1958. She spent the next six years as  a radar engineer with Sperry Gyroscope's Advanced Studies Department in Lake Success, N.Y. She held patents on radar receivers. At New York Life, she was a vice president for information systems.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Kamen is survived by two daughters, Katherine K. Berkowitz of Bethesda, Md., and Abigail K. Holland of Manhattan; her parents, Thelma and Murray Klein of Brooklyn, and a brother, Eric Klein of Manhattan.       
         Marie-Helene de Rothschild, one of Europe's most imaginative hostesses, whose activities were a major part of the Paris social season for many years, died on  Friday at her home in Ferrieres, 20 miles northeast of Paris. She was 65 and had suffered for three decades from an incurable degenerative arthritic ailment.         Baroness de Rothschild, whose husband, Baron Guy de Rothschild, is dean of the French branch of the banking family, was well known in the world of fashion  and was particularly renowned for the dinners, balls and benefits she organized. Many were held at Chateau Ferrieres, the former Rothschild mansion that now belongs to the French state. The house in which the Baroness died was built on the estate after the chateau had been given to the Government.         The Baroness, who enjoyed creating fantasies for her social occasions, once  greeted 150 guests at a dinner (Diner de Tetes Surrealistes, whose invitations had to be read in a mirror) dressed as a stag at the kill, with a mask of towering antlers and pear-shaped diamond "tears" on her face.         At a ball she gave at Ferrieres for 1,600 people, the chateau was covered in  white muslin to make it look like a huge diamond-studded cobweb. A gala for the  Paris Ballet transformed the Palais Garnier into a woodland, with trees and vines climbing to the ceiling. At another function, her Bal Proust, celebrating  the 100th anniversary of Marcel Proust's birth, Cecil Beaton took guests' photographic portraits.         "When she has made up her mind about something, there is nothing on earth that can deter her," her husband once said.         The daughter of Baron Egmont van Zuylen de Nyevelt de Haar, a Dutch diplomat, and an Egyptian mother, the Baroness was educated at Marymount College in New York.         On a trip to Paris shortly after leaving school, she met and married Count Francois de Nicolay. They were divorced six years later after she had met Baron  de Rothschild and he, too, had decided to obtain a divorce. The Rothschilds were married in 1957 in a civil ceremony in New York -- "to allow the tempest we had  stirred up by a double divorce to subside a little," the Baroness once recalled.         After Ferrieres was donated to the Government, the Baroness did most of her entertaining at her Paris residence, the 18th-century Hotel Lambert on Ile St.-Louis. Her guests included a cross-section of international society, business and the arts -- the Duchess of Windsor, Princess Grace, Elizabeth Taylor, Yves Saint Laurent, Oscar de la Renta and Andy Warhol.         "A good way of making people happy is to allow them to meet their opposites," she once said.         Nan Kempner, a New York socialite and a longtime friend, said, "She had enormous intelligence and curiosity and she wanted to see and do everything."         When France nationalized Banque Rothschild in 1981, the Baron moved to New York for a short time. Although the Baroness's illness made traveling difficult, she worked with an interior decorator on refurbishing their Upper East Side apartment.         The Baroness was also a major supporter of French couture and for many years  was in the front row at important shows. She was president of the committee that organized the 1973 Divertissement a Versailles, an event at which American designers were not only introduced to Europeans but also upstaged their French counterparts.         Survivors include her husband; two sons, Philippe de Nicolay, and Edouard de  Rothschild of Paris; a stepson, David de Rothschild of Paris, and a brother, Teddy van Zuylen of London.       
         Frieda Sandberg Lewis, a champion of Jewish causes and past national president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on Feb. 29 in Deerfield Beach, Fla. She was 85, and a former resident of Great Neck, L.I., and Manhattan.         Mrs. Lewis's association with Hadassah went back four decades. She served as  national vice president and treasurer and headed its Nassau and Suffolk region as well as a number of its divisions. She was national president from 1980 to 1984. During her tenure, she presided over the creation of Hadassah International, which now has branches in some 30 countries.         She also held leadership positions in Jewish international affairs. She was  a past chairwoman of the American section of the World Jewish Congress and head  of its global commission on anti-Semitism for North America.         She was a life board member of Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a trustee of the American Friends of Hebrew University. Recently, she was a member of the  executive and national board of the American Zionist Federation and sat on the presidium of the Zionist General Council.         Mrs. Lewis was active in a number of other organizations, including the American Foundation for Jewish Culture, the advisory board of the National Jewish Family Center of the American Jewish, the United States and New York Holocaust Commissions, the Synagogue Council of America and the World Synagogue  Council.         She was born in Manhattan and was a graduate of Adelphi University.         Mrs. Lewis is survived by her husband of 65 years, Edward Lewis; two sons, Dr. Jeffrey Lewis of Armonk, N.Y., and Dr. Michael Lewis of Nashville, Tenn.; a  sister, Beatrice Smith of Franklin Square, L.I., and nine grandchildren.       
         Audrey Cohen, an innovative educator for more than 30 years and president and founder of Audrey Cohen College, died on Sunday morning at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said Alida Mesrop, acting president of Audrey Cohen College.         Despite her diminutive and seemingly frail stature, Ms. Cohen was a powerhouse of energy when scorning the rigidity and failures of the contemporary educational system and proposing how to reform it.         Her central idea -- that education must never be abstract but must be closely linked with clearly understood purposes -- attracted wide interest, especially among individuals and institutions serving members of minority groups, immigrants and the disadvantaged seeking access to the mainstream of American society.         At present, Audrey Cohen schools enroll about 20,000 elementary and secondary school students at locations in five states (Arizona, California, Florida, Mississippi and Tennessee), and some 1,500 undergraduate and graduate students in Manhattan at 75 Varick Street.         All of these institutions practice what Ms. Cohen described in a recent interview as "purpose centered" instruction. Her theory, she explained, is that  students learn best when they use their knowledge and skills to achieve a stated purpose.         In the early grades, she said, an entire class guided by a teacher may focus  on a single purpose, like finding ways to work together. Older students plan and carry out individual programs aimed at purposes like "We work for safety" or "We help people through the arts."         College-level students devote each semester to a more complex purpose in classes like "Values and Ethics," in which they study history, literature and government to extract ethical ideas, and "Self and Others," for the study of arts and writing, to develop productive relationships with people of all ages and cultures.         "Instead of teaching, let's say, the works of Schopenhauer or Rousseau," she  said, "our college students concentrate on a purpose such as 'Values and Ethics' in which they may read passages from the writings of Schopenhauer, Rousseau and  others which are relevant to the study of values and ethics. That way, it has a  deeper meaning to the students."         Asked if approaching the classics with relatively narrow and invariably positive preconceptions might distort their meaning, Ms. Cohen insisted that students at her institutions are encouraged to read more than just assigned passages. "Our approach helps students to fit things together," she said.         Her methods have attracted considerable interest and support among educators  throughout the country. Since 1992, Audrey Cohen College has received substantial grants from the New American Schools Development Corporation, a private, nonprofit organization based in Arlington, Va., that supports research  to find ways to revitalize teaching.         This year the college has been selected for support by the Education Commission of the States, a nonprofit organization that advises the states on education policy.         Born and raised in Pittsburgh, Ms. Cohen graduated magna cum laude from the University of Pittsburgh, and later did postgraduate work at George Washington University.         In 1958, recognizing that college-educated women restricted by child rearing  needed jobs with flexible work schedules, she founded Part Time Research Associates, a social science research corporation.         In the 1960's, Ms. Cohen became aware of the nation's shift from a manufacturing to a service economy, and the lack of training to meet the new requirements. This awareness led to her founding the Women's Talent Corps, which prepared numerous women for careers in such fields as social work, mental health services, occupational therapy and paralegal work.         Soon the Talent Corps became the College for Human Services, and there Ms. Cohen developed the ideas that led in 1964 to the founding of Audrey Cohen College, with its emphasis on practicality and purpose.         Ms. Cohen is survived by her husband, Dr. Ralph Wharton of Manhattan; two daughters, Winifred Alisa Cohen-Smith of Manhattan and Dawn Jennifer Cohen Margolin of Piedmont, Calif., and a brother, Carl Cohen of North Haven, Conn.       
         Razia Bhatti, a Pakistani editor who championed social causes and campaigned  against Government corruption, died on Tuesday at her home in Karachi. She was 52 and the founding editor of Newsline, Pakistan's most influential political monthly.         Colleagues said Mrs. Bhatti, who suffered from high blood pressure, died of a brain hemorrhage.         In the political turmoil of Pakistan and the violent chaos of Karachi, Mrs.  Bhatti and her magazine represented a consistent voice for democracy, social improvement and the freedom to publish unpopular views.         Her death came just seven months after Mrs. Bhatti stared down police officers who invaded her home after her magazine had published an article critical of the Governor of the province around Karachi.         Ordered to report to a police station where criminal charges had been filed at the Governor's behest, Mrs. Bhatti refused to comply. In the furor that followed, the charges were quietly withdrawn.         No one who knew her was surprised by her defiance. She and her magazine had withstood so many similar efforts at intimidation that a year earlier she received a Courage in Journalism award from the International Women's Media Foundation in Washington.         In a country where editors and reporters are subject to threats and violence, Newsline owed its existence to Government censorship.         It was founded in 1989 after Mrs. Bhatti resigned as editor of The Herald, a  magazine affiliated with Pakistan's largest newspaper group, rather than soften  its attacks on what Mrs. Bhatti saw as untenable policies and corruption. Several women who had worked for her at The Herald followed her and helped her found Newsline as an independent staff-owned magazine.         She is survived by her husband, Gul Hameed Bhatti; two children, Kamil and Sara; a sister, Fareeda Boudrey, and three brothers, Karim, Rahim and Rafeeg Boudry, all of Karachi.       
         Jacquetta Hawkes, archeologist and author, who was the widow of the playwright and novelist J. B. Priestley, died on Monday at Cheltenham General Hospital in London. She was 85, and lived in the Cotswolds town of Chipping Camden.         In "Man on Earth," "A Land" and many other books, Ms. Hawkes searched for the humanity within science. She said, "Let us have the courage to accept the inner  experience that tells us we are something more and that we may be part of a process much greater still." Her fervent interest was in the world of prehistory.         Discovering a Neanderthal skeleton, she said: "I was conscious of this vanished being and myself as part of an unbroken stream of consciousness . . . With an imaginative effort it is possible to see the eternal present in which all days, all the seasons of the plain, stand in enduring unity." In her polymathic career, she was also a poet and novelist and, in collaboration with her husband, a playwright.         Reviewing "Time and the Priestleys, the Story of a Friendship," Diana Collins's 1994 double biography of Mr. Priestley and Ms. Hawkes, Peter Ackroyd said there was no reason Ms. Hawkes "should be remembered as the wife of anyone  . . . since her own story is as interesting and as compelling as that of Priestley himself."         That story began in her childhood when she dug in her family garden, which had once been part of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery. As Mr. Ackroyd said, "She discovered nothing, but found within herself a lasting treasure; it was her love of learning and her passion for the past." It was her goal in life "to retrieve  the landscapes of history."         Jacquetta Hopkins was born on Aug. 10, 1910, in Cambridge, which became the center of her early life. She graduated from the university with a degree in archeology and anthropology. In 1933, she married Christopher Hawkes, a professor of archeology, and they had a son, Nicolas. Her interest in archeology took her on expeditions to Palestine as well as England. During and immediately  after World War II, she held several government posts and was the founder of the United Kingdom Commission for Unesco.         Her 1951 book, "A Land" (with illustrations by Henry Moore), was based on her work as archeological adviser for the Festival of Britain. In his review in the  New York Times Book Review, Stanley Edgar Hyman said that Ms. Hawkes had told the "story of the shaping of the earth and the development of life with simple eloquence" and described "A Land" as "a triumph of skill as well as a work of love." Through the next 30 years Ms. Hawkes was a prolific author, writing bold  and often poetic books about archeology, geology and the history of mankind.         In 1947 she met Mr. Priestley at a Unesco conference in Mexico City. They were drawn together by the "magnetism of polarity," said Ms. Hawkes. She divorced Mr. Hawkes, and in 1953 married Mr. Priestley. It was his third marriage. She and Mr. Priestley collaborated on several projects, including the  play "Dragon's Mouth." When it was produced Off Broadway in 1955, Brooks Atkinson said in his review that the authors had "succeeded in writing a remarkably stimulating conversation" that was second only to Shaw's "Don Juan in Hell."         Ms. Hawkes's books included "A Woman as Great as the World," a collection of  fables and a science fiction novelette; "Journey Down a Rainbow," a personalized account of a visit to the United States written with Mr. Priestley; "Providence  Island: An Archeological Tale"; "King of the Two Lands: The Pharaoh, Akhenaten," and "Dawn of the Gods," a study of Greece in the Bronze Age. In the 1970's she wrote "The First Great Civilizations: Life in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and  Egypt," and atlases of ancient archeology and early human life. "A Quest for Love," in 1981, was an autobiographical novel.         Mr. Priestley died in 1984. Ms. Hawkes is survived by her son from her first  marriage.       
         Dr. Helene Wickham Koon, an author, scholar of 18th-century dramatic literature and former professor of English at California State University in San Bernardino, died on Feb. 13 at her home in Hollywood. She was 71.         The cause was emphysema, said Bernard P. Wiesen, a friend.         Dr. Koon was born in Minneapolis, and graduated from the University of Iowa. She pursued an earlier career as an actress, director and writer for theaters and radio stations in California and New Mexico. She opted for academia, however, and in 1969 earned a doctorate in English at the University of California in Los Angeles.         That year she joined the faculty of what was then California State College and was appointed a full professor in 1978. She also served as chairwoman of the department from 1975 to 1980.         Dr. Koon was the author of biographies of Colley Cibber, an English actor and dramatist (1671-1757), and Eugene Scribe, the French playwright (1791-1861). She also published "How Shakespeare Won the West," a study of Shakespearean stage productions during the Gold Rush, and "Dictionary of Gold Rush Performers, " among other books.         The author of numerous articles, she wrote poems and translated French literature and plays.         She is survived by her husband, Charles J. Koon; five sons, Christopher, Robin, Gavin, Nicholas and Lachlan; and six grandchildren.       
         Phyllis Smith Vineyard, a corporate communications and customer service consultant who was also involved in health, family planning and social welfare,  died of cancer on March 16 at her home in Blue Point, L.I. She was 72.         In 1974, Mrs. Vineyard became the first woman to serve on the Long Island Lighting Company's board. She was also a customer services consultant for William J. Catacosinos, the Lilco chairman, from 1987 to 1994.         Mrs. Vineyard was a member and past chairwoman of the Washington-based Population Institute, an educational organization she represented at conferences in Latin America, Europe, Asia and the Middle East. A board member of Planned Parenthood Federation of America, she represented that organization at the International Planned Parenthood Federation in London, and led the first visit of American family planners to Communist China.         She was also a past chairwoman of the New York Statewide Health Coordination  Council and a member of the New York Planning Commission. She was a founding member of the Long Island Community Foundation and founding president of Planned Parenthood of Suffolk County.         Born in Ridgefield, Conn., she attended Simmons College and the University of Missouri at Columbia.         Her husband, Dr. George H. Vineyard, died in 1987. She is survived by a daughter, Missy Vineyard of Amherst, Mass.; a son, John H., of Ithaca, N.Y; a sister, Barbara Vineyard of Sanibel, Fla., and four grandchildren.       
         Margaret Rockefeller, who worked on behalf of farmland conservation, the American Farmland Trust, the New York Botanical Garden and the New York Philharmonic, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 80 and the wife of David Rockefeller, former chairman of the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         The cause was complications from heart surgery, a family spokesman said.         Although she served on numerous boards and was involved in fund raising for  a number of projects, Mrs. Rockefeller, who was known as Peggy, maintained a low profile, preferring to remain in the background and devoting much of her time to causes that were more worthy than fashionable.         Particularly concerned with agricultural issues and the environment, she was  a founding board member of the American Farmland Trust and the Maine Coast Heritage Trust, serving as chairman for many years. She was also a member of the Nature Conservancy and the National Historic Trust.         In the mid-1970's, Mrs. Rockefeller began to buy and raise cattle, first on Bartlett Island in Maine, near the Rockefeller summer home in Seal Harbor, and then at Pocantico, the family home in Tarrytown, N.Y. In 1980, Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller bought four farms in western Columbia County, N.Y., where Mrs. Rockefeller became an accomplished farmer, raising purebred Simmental cattle.         "I always loved the country, farming and animals," she said in an interview with The New York Times soon after the purchase of the Columbia County farms. She read all she could about farmland preservation until "little by little, I was trapped," she said         In 1992, Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller announced an agreement with the American Farmland Trust and the Columbia County Land Conservancy that would place under protection for perpetuity almost 2,000 acres of their Hudson River Valley property.         Mrs. Rockefeller made substantial contributions to Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts and the New York Philharmonic and was a trustee from 1953 to 1970.         Mrs. Rockefeller was also a member of the Board of Managers of the New York Botanical Garden. She came up with the idea for and helped finance the garden's  series of six illustrated books on America's wildflowers. She organized the National Committee for the Wild Flowers of the United States, which raised some  $500,000 for the project.         In 1988, Mrs. Rockefeller opened the Peggy Rockefeller Rose Garden at the New York Botanical Garden, a two-acre enclave of some 2,700 roses. The restoration of the original 1915 garden designed by Beatrix Jones Farrand was supported by a $1 million gift from Mr. Rockefeller.         Mr. and Mrs. Rockefeller received the Pillar of New York Award, given by the  Preservation League of New York State, last fall.         The daughter of Francis Sims and Neva van Zandt Smith McGrath, Mrs. Rockefeller was born in New York and grew up in Mount Kisco. She attended the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and the Chapin School in New York. She met her future husband in the early 1930's and they were married in 1940 in Bedford, N.Y. The couple celebrated their 55th wedding anniversary last September.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by six children, David Jr., Abby  Rockefeller and Neva Goodwin, all of Masschusetts; Peggy Dulany of New York, Dr. Richard of Maine, and Eileen Growald of California; a brother, Sims McGrath of Tenants Harbor, Me., and 10 grandchildren.         Correction:  March 28, 1996, Thursday         An obituary yesterday about Margaret Rockefeller, conservationist and philanthropist, misidentified the museum of which her husband, David Rockefeller, is chairman emeritus. It is the Museum of Modern Art, not the Metropolitan Museum.       
         Natalie Holland, who supported a number of philanthropic and other institutions, died on Monday at her winter home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 89 and lived on Manhattan's Upper East Side.         She was a prominent supporter of Bar-Ilan University in Israel. Her other principal beneficiaries included the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies, the Kingsbrook Jewish Medical Center and Yeshiva University's Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where she belonged to the Society of Founders.         She is survived by her husband of 67 years, Jack C. Holland; two sons, Stephen of Manhattan, and Richard of Woodmere, L.I.; four grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.       
         Helen Bunce, who knitted so many mittens she didn't know what to do unless she was knitting more mittens, died on Feb. 24 at a nursing home in Watertown, N.Y., where she was known as the Mitten Lady. She was 86 and had been knitting mittens until a few days before her death.         Mrs. Bunce had been a legend in Watertown and in international church circles for decades, although until December only a few people knew she was the Mitten Lady whose anonymous handmade donations to an annual church clothing drive had spread her fame far and wide.         Since 1948, when the third-grade Sunday school class at the Emmanuel Congregational Church in Watertown established a special Christmas tree to collect clothing for poor children, Mrs. Bunce had spent every otherwise spare moment knitting away.         "She could knit in her sleep," her daughter, Helen McDonald, said yesterday,  estimating that her mother had knitted at least 4,000 pairs of mittens over the  last 47 years, and probably a lot more.         "She didn't keep records in the early years," Mrs. McDonald said, "but some years she did more than 200."         For all the mittens she turned out, the Mitten Lady sobriquet was somewhat misleading. Mrs. Bunce, who knew that little heads as well as hands needed protection against the cold, knitted a matching cap for every pair of mittens and also turned out scarves.         The sets, which included a handwritten tag saying "God Loves You, and So Do I," were distributed to various churches and charities in Watertown and through  Church World Service, the Protestant relief agency, to poor children across the  nation and abroad.         As word of Mrs. Bunce's work spread, people across the country began sending  her yarn in care of the church, and she kept a scrapbook of thank-you notes from children she had helped and photographs showing some of them wearing her handiwork. Like the donated packages of yarn, the notes, addressed simply to the Mitten Lady, were delivered to the church and then passed on to her.         Mrs. Bunce, who lived in Watertown most of her life, carried her knitting wherever she went, clicking away whenever she found a spare moment. Her mittens, which always included two contrasting colors in striking designs, came in three  sizes, with the colors becoming darker as the sizes increased.         Although she suffered from osteoporosis so painful that she found it difficult to sit in a wheelchair in her last months, Mrs. Bunce, who had taught  herself to knit lying down after entering the nursing home, insisted on being taken to the church in December to make her usual surreptitious donation of her  year's production.         This time her cover was blown. She was introduced to the congregation as the  Mitten Lady, and the woman who had once explained that she labored anonymously because the purpose of her work was to help poor children and not to have people say, "Oh, that's wonderful," had to endure a five-minute ovation.         Then she went back to the nursing home and continued her knitting. Mrs. Bunce, who always made it a point to start a new pair of mittens or a cap as soon as one was completed (on the assumption, she once explained, that God would not let anything happen to her as long as she had unfinished work), apparently knew the end was near. When she died, her daughter said, her needles were empty.         Mrs. Bunce's husband of 67 years, Karl, died on Feb. 27. In addition to her daughter, of Alexandria Bay, N.Y., she is survived by two sons, Roy, of Strasbourg, France, and Jack, of Watertown; 11 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Marguerite Duras, author of the best-selling novel "The Lover" and one of the most widely read French writers of the postwar era, died today at her home in Paris. She was 81.         Miss Duras, who was also a prolific playwright, film maker and screenwriter,  was best known for the way she used her early life in French Indochina as the inspiration for many of her works, including "The Lover," the story of her clandestine teen-age romance with a wealthy young Chinese man. Yet perhaps what  most characterized her 53-year literary career was her simple, terse writing style, as if language itself were merely a vehicle for conveying passion and desire, pain and despair. The mysteries of love and sex consumed her, but she had no room for sentimentality in her works, or indeed, in her life.         I write about love, yes, but not about tenderness," she said in a 1990 interview. "I don't like tender people. I myself am very harsh. When I love someone, I desire them. But tenderness supposes the exclusion of desire." Ever provocative in her use of language, she always bowed to the supremacy of words.  "Acting doesn't bring anything to a text," Miss Duras wrote of her work for cinema and theater. "On the contrary, it detracts from it -- lessens its immediacy and depth, weakens its muscles and dilutes its blood."         In the theater, this seemed to matter little, and her plays continue to be performed regularly in France. However, despite the enormous success of her screenplay for Alain Resnais's 1960 classic, "Hiroshima, Mon Amour," few of the  19 movies she wrote and directed herself did well, not least because words often entirely replaced action. Until her 70th birthday, her novels had a loyal  albeit small readership. With the publication of "The Lover" in 1984, however, Miss Duras reached a mass audience in France and abroad. The book sold more than two million copies and was made into a well-received film in 1992 by Jean-Jacques Annaud.         Because she considered her words to be sacrosanct, she often had stormy dealings with movie directors who adapted her novels, among them Peter Brook, Tony Richardson and Jules Dassin. And when Mr. Annaud altered her screenplay for "The Lover," Miss Duras broke with him and turned her text into yet another semi-autobiographical novel, "The Lover From Northern China." She described that book, published in 1991, as a "reappropriation" of "The Lover," yet once again she seemed to be reinventing her life to a point where it became impossible to know whether her original novel, Mr. Annaud's film or her second version of the  story was the closest to reality. To Miss Duras, of course, this did not matter.         She was born on April 4, 1914, in Gia Dinh, near Saigon. Her parents, Henri and Marie Donnadieu (she changed her name to Duras in the 1930's), were teachers in France's colonial service. She was only a child when her father died, and her first memories were of economic hardship, above all after her mother invested the family's savings in a disastrous rice-farming venture.         After attending school in Saigon, Miss Duras moved to France at the age of 18 to study law and political science. After graduation, she worked as a secretary  in the French Ministry of the Colonies until 1941, but by then Nazi Germany had  occupied France. In 1943, she joined the Resistance in a small group that included Francois Mitterrand, who remained a friend until his recent death.         In 1939, Miss Duras married the writer Robert Antelme, who was arrested and deported to Germany during the war. By the time he returned from Dachau concentration camp in 1945 (he was the subject of her 1985 book "La Douleur," later published in the United States as "The War"), she was already involved with Dionys Mascolo, who was to become her second husband and with whom she had  a son, Jean.         In the late 1940's, Miss Duras joined the French Communist Party, and though  she later resigned, she always described herself a Marxist. Yet perhaps her strongest political stance was her contempt for Gen. Charles de Gaulle. "He never pronounced the word Jew after the war," she said in the 1990 interview. "Many people think I am Jewish, and that always pleases me."         Her first book, "Les Impudents," was published in 1943, and from that time, she lived off her writing, gradually building a body of work that included more than 70 novels, plays, screenplays and adaptations. She eventually acquired a country home in Normandy, but her book-lined Left Bank apartment on the Rue St.-Benoit remained her Paris home from 1942 until her death.         For many years, she struggled with alcoholism -- a subject she frequently addressed in her writings -- and her health was further shattered by emphysema.  But in the 1980's, long separated from Mr. Mascolo, she also found love again in an unusual relationship with a young homosexual writer, Yann Andrea Steiner, with whom she shared her final years.         Late last year, struggling again with illness, Miss Duras published "That's All," a tiny 54-page book that seemed intended to be her literary adieu to her readers, to Mr. Steiner and to herself. Written between November 1994 and last August, with each occasional entry carrying a date, it consisted of poetic bursts of love, fear and despair, as if all too aware that her death was near.         The very last entry, on the afternoon of Aug. 1, 1995, read:         "I think it is all over. That my life is finished.         "I am no longer anything.         "I have become an appalling sight.         "I am falling apart.         "Come quickly.         "I no longer have a mouth, no longer a face."         She is survived by her son and Mr. Steiner.       
         Erma Bombeck, who mined the everyday lives of housewives and parents for the  mother lode of humor that transformed her into one of the country's most popular newspaper columnists and a best-selling author, died yesterday at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center. Mrs. Bombeck, who made her home in Paradise Valley, Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix, was 69.         Mrs. Bombeck, afflicted for years with polycystic kidney disease, a hereditary ailment, underwent a kidney transplant this month at the hospital, which said she died of complications after the surgery.         Three times a week until about two years ago, and more recently on a twice-weekly schedule, Mrs. Bombeck did what she had done since 1964: sifted greasy ovens, voracious washing machines, sibling rivalry and the predilections  of couch-potato spouses for the nuggets of mirth that won her the devotion of readers who followed her 500- to 600-word columns in some 600 newspapers.         "My type of humor is almost pure identification," she said. "A housewife reads my column and says, 'But that's happened to me! I know just what she's talking about!' "         Fans appreciated Mrs. Bombeck's slapstick approach to housekeeping and family relations.         *Dirty ovens: "If it won't catch fire today, clean it tomorrow."         *The dilemmas of sibling rivalry: "Who gets the fruit cocktail with the lone  cherry on top?"         *Affairs: "If a woman is ever to have an affair, it will be in March. Psychologically, it is a perfect month. The bowling tournaments are over. The white sales on bedding are past. Your chest cold has stabilized and the Avon lady is beginning to look like Tom Jones."         *Male habits: "If a man watches 16 consecutive quarters of football, he can be declared legally dead."         *Housework: "My second favorite household chore is ironing. My first being hitting my head on the top bunk bed until I faint."         *Teen-agers: "Don't ever say you understand them. It breaks down the hostile  relationship between you that it takes to understand one another."         Even at the pinnacle of success, earning $500,000 to $1 million a year, Mrs.  Bombeck made cleaning house, grocery shopping and cooking dinner a part of her weekly routine. "If I didn't do my own housework, then I have no business writing about it," she said. "I spend 90 percent of my time living scripts and 10 percent writing them."         Besides her columns, distributed at the time of her death by the Universal Press Syndicate in Kansas City, Mo., Mrs. Bombeck was the author of more than a  dozen books, including popular successes with titles like "The Grass Is Always Greener Over the Septic Tank" (1976), "If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I  Doing in the Pits?" (1978) and "Motherhood: The Second Oldest Profession" (1983).         From 1975 to 1986 she appeared twice a week on "Good Morning America" on the  ABC network. At various times, she wrote a monthly column for Good Housekeeping, contributed to magazines like Reader's Digest, Family Circle, Redbook and McCall's; lectured; created, wrote and produced the short-lived 1981 ABC television series "Maggie" and saw "The Grass Is Always Greener" turned into a 1978 prime-time CBS television movie starring Carol Burnett as a concerned mother who was Mrs. Bombeck's alter ego and Charles Grodin as her husband.         In 1988, after her previous five books had sold more than 15 million copies,  she signed a three-book contract with Harper & Row valued by publishing experts  at $12 million.         Mrs. Bombeck was a housewife and mother, living outside Dayton in Centerville, Ohio, and advancing toward 40 when she determined to change her life.         "That's when I used to sit at the kitchen window, year after year, watching women like Ruth Gordon, Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Golda Meir carving out their own careers," she said. "I decided that it wasn't fulfilling to clean chrome faucets with a toothbrush. At 37, I decided it was my time to strike out.         In 1964, after the last of her three children started school, she began writing columns. She was, she said, "too old for a paper route, too young for Social Security and too tired for an affair."         Erma Louise Fiste was born Feb. 21, 1927, in Dayton. When she was 9, her father, a crane operator named Cassius Fiste, died of a heart attack at 42. "One day you were a family, living in a little house at the bottom of a hill," she said. "The next day it was all gone."         Mrs. Bombeck, who began writing a humor column at Emerson Junior High in Dayton, worked as a copy girl for The Dayton Journal-Herald after graduating from high school in 1944. She became a reporter there after graduating from the  University of Dayton with a bachelor of arts degree in 1949, the same year she married William Bombeck, a sportswriter who became a high school principal.         Mrs. Bombeck said she chose the subject of her columns because "being a housewife was the only thing in life I could discuss for more than 10 minutes."         She persuaded Ron Ginger, the editor of The Kettering-Oakwood Times, a suburban weekly, to pay her $3 a column, and she was on her way.         In 1992, Mrs. Bombeck underwent a mastectomy after cancer was diagnosed in a  breast, and not long afterward, as her kidneys failed, she began undergoing dialysis at her home.         In addition to her husband, who lives in Paradise Valley, and her mother, Erma Harris, of Sun City, Ariz., Mrs. Bombeck is survived by her three children: Betsy and Andrew, of Phoenix and Matthew, of Los Angeles.       
         Molly Keane, an Anglo-Irish novelist who had ridden to enough hounds, attended enough hunt balls and listened to enough below-stairs gossip by the time she was 17 to sustain two literary careers three decades apart, died on Monday at her cliffside home in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland. She was 91.         Although she was best known for her novel "Good Behavior," a finalist for the 1981 Booker Prize, its publication represented the resumption of a career she had abandoned after the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier.         It was a career that had been born and remained grounded in her childhood experiences.         Growing up in a grand home in County Wexford, where her Protestant English father was a noted fox hunter and her Irish mother was a lapsed poet and Italian literary scholar who wrote occasional reviews, was not entirely pleasant for Mrs. Kean.         But although her own sister once described her as an unloved child, her childhood served her well, providing the swirling fox-hunting background and social intrigue she drew on for more than a dozen novels and five plays.         An accomplished horsewoman herself, Mrs. Keane never apologized for her own youthful enchantment with a world circumscribed by riding, dancing and clothes.  Indeed, she began writing as a teen-ager, she once acknowledged, to supplement her dress allowance.         She also took the precaution of using a pseudonym, M. J. Farrell, a name she  spied on a board outside an Irish pub while riding home from a hunt.         "It would have been death to be known as a writer," she once explained.         Although the real identity of M. J. Farrell had long since become known in Irish and English literary circles, it was not until "Good Behavior" that Mrs. Keane, whose original name had been Mary Nesta Skrine, felt secure in publishing under a name of her own.         After the publication of "Good Behavior," her earlier works, including "Conversation Piece" and "Rising Tide," were reissued, and Mrs. Keane added two  further novels, "Time After Time," (Knopf, 1983) and "Loving and Giving," published in the United States by Dutton as "Queen Lear."         Mrs. Keane, who mined the same vein of childhood experiences time after time, inevitably found new nuggets of insight or intrigue. Unlike her earlier works, which she once suggested were written to portray a life she had wished for herself, her later novels had more bite, depicting the darker side of life among the disenfranchised Anglo-Irish gentry. ("Good Behavior" begins as the main character is genteely murdering her own mother.)         As a young adult, Mrs. Keane continued her childhood interest in parties and  gaiety, marrying a young Irishman, Bobby Keane, four years her junior, but only  after living with him for five years.         In her mid-30's she added plays to her repertory, writing five with John Perry, including "Spring Meeting," which was directed by John Gielgud in 1938 and provided Margaret Rutherford with her first starring role.         When she was 40, her husband died, and Mrs. Keane, who had two daughters, Sally and Virginia, was so grief-stricken she found she no longer had the zest for writing. She did manage to turn out two more novels, but with the exception  of a play that was panned in 1961, she wrote nothing until "Good Behavior" marked her return to form in 1981.         She is survived by her daughters.       
         Margaret Livingston Partridge Burden, a Manhattan philanthropist long associated with the Community Service Society, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side. She was 86.         Born in Manhattan, Mrs. Burden attended the Nightingale Bamford School and studied at the Art Students League in New York. She was the widow of William A.  M. Burden, a former diplomat, longtime president of the Museum of Modern Art and founder of the private investment firm of William A. M. Burden & Company, of which Mrs. Burden remained a limited partner. Mr. Burden died in 1984.         Although she was engaged in many charitable activities, her main interest was the Community Service Society. She became a trustee in 1937 and remained on  the board as an honorary trustee.         She worked for many years with the International Council of the Young Women's Christian Association and the president's activities committee of the Museum of  Modern Art, of which her husband was president in the 1950's and 1960's.         She was the daughter of the sculptor William Ordway Partridge, whose stone Pieta sits in St. Patrick's Cathedral, and the poet Margaret Livingston Partridge.         Mrs. Burden is survived by two sons, Hamilton and Ordway, both of Manhattan,  three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Lynn O'Donnell, the producer of the documentary film "Crumb," died in San Francisco on April 17. She was 43. The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Lawrence Wilkinson.         Ms. O'Donnell produced and directed several films, but her greatest critical  success came with "Crumb," a dark portrait of the underground cartoonist Robert  Crumb and his family. Directed by Terry Zwigoff, it won the top prize for documentaries at the 1995 Sundance Film Festival.         Ms. O'Donnell was born in Berkeley, Calif. After earning a degree in film making from San Francisco State University, she worked as an editor in Vienna on the television mini-series "Holocaust" and on German feature films. From 1977 to 1980 she worked at KQED, the San Francisco public television station, where she  became head of production.         After leaving KQED, she produced and directed "Voices of the Tango," a documentary about the Argentine tango singer Carlos Gardel, and produced "Czeslaw Milosz: The Poet Remembers," which was directed by Jan Nemec. She also  produced "Living on Tokyo Time," the first feature by the director Steven Okazaki.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Nora; her parents, Virginia and Ashton O'Donnell, of Woodside, Calif., and three sisters, Sherry Burns, of Cupertino, Calif.; Joan, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Jennifer Conner, of San Rafael, Calif.         Correction:  April 30, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about the producer of the documentary film "Crumb" misspelled her surname in some references. She was Lynn O'Donnell, not O'Connell       
         Siti Hartinah Suharto, the wife of President Suharto of Indonesia, died today of a heart attack, a spokesman for the President said. She was 72.         Mrs. Suharto died in the Gatot Subroto military hospital in central Jakarta.  The Government ordered a week of mourning.         Her death came as the President, who is 74, enters the campaign for next year's general election. That is to be followed in early 1998 by a presidential  race in which Mr. Suharto, a former army general who has been President since 1968, is expected to run for a seventh term.         Mrs. Suharto's body was taken to her hometown in Solo, in central Java, for burial on Monday at the family mausoleum. Thousands lined the streets to catch a glimpse of the hearse transporting her body to the military airport in Jakarta.         The Suhartos were married in 1947. In addition to her husband, Mrs. Suharto is survived by three sons, three daughters and several grandchildren.       
         Martha Keehn, a social worker in India and Africa, died on April 5 at North Shore Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 73 and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         From 1952 to 1961, Mrs. Keehn directed social welfare projects for the Indian Cooperative Union, helping organize handicraft and other small industries in the villages of India.         A graduate of Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, Mrs. Keehn received  a master's degree from Columbia University in 1946.         She is survived by her husband of 50 years and co-worker, Thomas Keehn; a daughter, Deborah Keehn Black of Manhattan; five sons, Jonathan, of Grass Valley, Calif., David, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Benjamin, of Holliston, Mass., Adam, of Queens and Burkina Faso, and Joel, of Peekskill, N.Y.; a brother, William McKee, of Lafayette, Calif.; two sisters, Beatrice Watson, of Barstow, Calif., and Margaret Seder, of Stonington, Conn., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Frances Frenaye, a veteran American translator of French and Italian literary works into English, died on Friday at her apartment in Miami Beach. She was 88.         Earlier, Miss Frenaye lived for some 50 years in Manhattan, where she was employed, from 1963 to 1980, by the Italian Cultural Institute and edited its newsletter.         Over the years she also translated writings by scores of French and Italian  authors, including Balzac, Carlo Levi and Ignazio Silone. And she translated the writing of Elie Wiesel, who was born in Romania, from French.         According to Herbert Mitgang, an author and former New York Times book critic, the most notable aspect of her work was an ability to combine clarity and eloquence. "She didn't confine herself to literal translation," he said, "but also succeeded in capturing both the sense and the spirit of the author's intention."         An award jury that included Henri Peyre of Yale University chose Miss Frenaye to receive the 1951 Denyse Clairouin Memorial Award for distinguished translation of French into English for her renderings of the books "The Plunderers," by Georges Blond, and "Renee," by J. H. R. Lenormand.         Other books she translated included "Christ Stopped at Eboli" (1948), by Carlo Levi; "The Road to the City," by Natalia Ginzburg (1952), and "Little Misunderstandings of No Importance" (1985), by Antonio Tabucchi.         Miss Frenaye was also a freelance critic, and she appreciated -- though sometimes grudgingly -- esprit and individualism in people as well as in literature. Applauding a 1956 work, "Wingless Victory," about Gabriele d'Annunzio, the Italian poet, novelist and dramatist, and his mistress, the actress Eleonora Duse, Miss Frenaye wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book's author, Frances Winwar, "in her spirited and lush re-creation of the  posing poet, has done well to present him in his own terms."         "Perhaps, in our iron age," Miss Frenaye added, "there is something to be said for flaming lives and for individual rather than mass aberration."         Miss Frenaye was born in Lawrence, L.I., into a family of remote French origin. She graduated from the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and in 1930 from Bryn Mawr College. She then spent six years in Europe, mostly in Paris and  Rome.         In 1939 she married Angelo Lanza di Trabia, a Sicilian, and afterward she used the surname Lanza in her personal life, although not in her work. During World War II she was a Washington-based official of the Justice Department. In Manhattan, after the war, she wrote a column for an Italian newspaper, Il Mondo, for a time.         Miss Frenaye and her husband separated in 1961, when he moved back to Italy.  He died in 1978.         She is survived by a daughter, Bianca Lanza of Miami, and a grandson.       
         Alice Kornegay, a powerful community advocate in East Harlem for the better part of 40 years, died on Tuesday at North General Hospital.  She was 65.         According to Barbara Brown, an adopted daughter, Mrs. Kornegay had a heart attack while attending a board meeting of an addicts rehabilitation organization, one of the many community groups to which she lent her efforts.         A member of Community Board 11 and Community School Board 5, a former member of the 25th Precinct Community Council and a former treasurer of the Harlem Commonwealth Council, a community betterment organization, Mrs. Kornegay was perhaps best known as the founder and president of the Community Association of  the East Harlem Triangle. Through this not-for-profit organization, Mrs. Kornegay secured the financing for construction of low-income housing.         "In East Harlem, she was probably the strongest advocate for the African-American community," said Eddie Baca, the chairman of Community Board 11.         Mrs. Kornegay was also a co-sponsor with the Abyssinian Baptist Church in the effort to bring a Pathmark superstore to the area.         Mrs. Kornegay was Alice Grace Wragg when she came from Georgetown, S.C., her  birthplace, to live with cousins in East Harlem at the age of 10 after her parents died. She studied social work at Baruch College and graduated from the New School for Social Research.         Bette Washington, a longtime friend and associate, said that Mrs. Kornegay became active in local issues at once. "She saw a need in her community," Ms. Washington said.         Mrs. Kornegay's husband of 47 years, Richard, died last week. In addition to  Ms. Brown, a resident of the Bronx, she is survived by an adopted son, Anthony Wragg, and by three brothers, James Wragg of Manhattan, Wesley Wragg of Georgetown, S.C., and Sam Wragg of Philadelphia.       
         Dr. Henriette R. Klein, clinical professor emeritus of psychiatry at Columbia University and a pioneer in the study of childhood schizophrenia, died on May 11 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 94.         She researched, taught and practiced psychiatry for six decades and was associated with Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons as a special lecturer until 1993. She was the first woman to be elected president of the Association for Psychoanalytic Medicine and the first female member and president of the New York Psychiatric Society.         Dr. Klein was known for her direct style, her no-nonsense professionalism and the breadth of her interests. She was born in Evanston, Ill., and graduated  from the University of Chicago in 1924. She received her medical degree from the University of Maryland in 1932 and trained at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute from 1935 to 1940.         With her mentor, Dr. Howard W. Potter, she was co-author of a ground-breaking study in 1937 on diagnosing childhood schizophrenia. She and Dr. Potter also experimented with outpatient services for a child-care agency, a harbinger of community psychiatry.         Another focus of her work was the training of psychiatrists at Columbia's Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, which she joined in 1949. She studied the effects of psychoanalysis on the patient, a subject she repeatedly wrote about.         She took part in a study, "Anxiety in Pregnancy and Childbirth" (1950), which debunked the received wisdom that having a baby was an answer to unhappiness. Instead, the study found that having a child can aggravate underlying disturbances in women who are severely maladjusted or mentally ill.         With her husband, Dr. William A. Horwitz, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia, she explored the mechanisms of paranoia and helped broaden the dynamic explanations of that disorder. She also had a private psychiatric practice in Manhattan.         Dr. Klein organized psychiatric training centers at Emory University, New York University and the Long Island College of Medicine, which became the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York.         Among her professional concerns were the confidentiality of patients' records, the disciplining of psychiatrists who engage in sexual relations with patients and the discouraging of long-term analysis by older psychiatrists likely to die before the patient.         Dr. Klein is survived by a daughter, Dr. Susan Harris Molnar of Scarborough,  N.Y.; a son, William Harris of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and three grandchildren. Her husband died in 1968.       
         Irma Badillo, an adviser to Governors Mario M. Cuomo and Hugh L. Carey, died  yesterday at the Cabrini Hospital Hospice in Manhattan. Mrs. Badillo, who lived  in the Riverdale section of the Bronx until she was transferred to the hospice this month, was 72.         She had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for several years, and could not walk or talk for the last year, said her husband, Herman, a mayoral adviser and  former Congressman.         Mrs. Badillo worked for the Carey and Cuomo administrations as the deputy director of the Division for Women from 1978 until 1986, when she took over the  New York City office of the State Department of Social Services. She retired in  1990.         As the Deputy Director of the Division for Women, Mrs. Badillo helped run the state's efforts to pass an Equal Rights Amendment, organizing rallies and conferences in various cities and towns.         "She was one of the strongest and most passionate defenders of the Equal Rights Amendment," Mr. Badillo said. "The amendment lost, but in New York State  we put up a tremendous fight for it, and she was a big part of it."         Even before her career in state government, Mrs. Badillo was active on social issues. In the 1960's she worked for two poverty programs: the Suburban Action Institute, which aimed to build low- and moderate-income housing in New York, and the Center for Urban Education, which focused on the needs of New York City schools.         Mrs. Badillo was born in New York City. She was a graduate of Empire State College.         Her first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Badillo, she is survived by two children from a previous marriage, Loren Liebling of Honolulu and Dr. Mark Liebling of Nashua, N.H., and three grandchildren.       
         Frances L. Loeb, who spent a dozen years as New York City's liaison to its vast corps of foreign diplomats and a lifetime maintaining a family tradition of philanthropy, died on Friday at her home on Park Avenue. Mrs. Loeb, who also had homes in Purchase, N.Y., and Lyford Cay, Nassau, the Bahamas, was 89.         "One thing I had in my mind," Mrs. Loeb said in 1990 when she announced a $7.5 million gift to Vassar College for construction of an art center, "I'm never going to be the richest person in the cemetery."         With her husband, John L. Loeb, an investment banker, and other family members, Mrs. Loeb was a benefactor of Barnard College (where Adele Lehman Hall  was named for her mother), of Central Park (the Loeb Boathouse and the Children's Zoo), Lewisohn Stadium (which bore her maternal grandfather's name),  the Loeb Student Center at New York University and the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar.         In 1990, the Loebs pledged $70.5 million to finance new faculty positions and scholarships to Harvard College, as well as programs and positions in the schools of design and public health. The gift also benefited the Loeb Drama Center, home to the American Repertory Theater, established in 1957 with help from the Loebs.         Mrs. Loeb was also a trustee of Vassar and Cornell University and an overseer of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.         In addition to money, Mrs. Loeb gave time. For 12 years in the 1960's and 70's, during the administrations of Mayors John V. Lindsay and Abraham D. Beame, Mrs. Loeb was New York City's unsalaried commissioner for the United Nations and for the Consular Corps. Directing a staff of nine full-time and six part-time employees, Mrs. Loeb eased cultural shock and fostered amity in a foreign diplomatic community that numbered 35,000 people from 197 missions and 91 consulates.         Besides forgoing a salary, Mrs. Loeb stretched the commission's relatively scant $158,000 budget by coaxing, cajoling and wheedling tens of thousands of dollars from friends and family. She committed the gifts to financing lectures,  establishing nursery schools, providing counseling about high schools and colleges and sponsoring courses in English.         In 1976, Mrs. Loeb and her staff handled more than 1,800 inquiries about housing, education, traffic, consumer fraud, police, family matters and legal problems. Thirty volunteers made more than 900 visits or telephone calls to 796  new diplomatic arrivals, and Mrs. Loeb attended endless receptions, lunches and  dinner meetings.         Frances Lehman Loeb was born in Manhattan on Sept. 25, 1906, into two of the  German-Jewish families whose rise to prominence and zeal for public service were chronicled in Stephen Birmingham's 1972 book, "Our Crowd." These 100 or so families founded banking, securities and retailing empires and many were known for their philanthropies. Her mother was Adele Lewisohn, the daughter of Adolph  Lewisohn, who made his fortune shipping mining products. Her father was Arthur Lehman of the investment banking family. One uncle, Herbert H. Lehman, became Governor of New York. Another uncle, Irving Lehman, became Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals.         Frances Lehman attended Vassar from 1924 to 1926. In 1926 she and John Loeb were married in the Park Avenue apartment of her grandfather Adolph Lewisohn. From the 1930's through the 1970's, Mr. Loeb was a partner in the investment firm of Loeb, Rhoades & Company.         Throughout her life, Mrs. Loeb was known as Peter, a name she traced to the days when she was "the unwanted girl baby" and "Peter Pan" was playing on Broadway.         "I was a sick child," she said, "and they called me Peter Pan, hoping that I  would live forever."         Besides her husband of 69 years, Mrs. Loeb is survived by their five children: Judith L. Chiara of Manhattan and Purchase, John L. Loeb Jr. of Manhattan and Purchase, Ann Loeb Bronfman of Washington, Arthur Lehman Loeb of Manhattan and Deborah Loeb Brice of London; 14 grandchildren, and more than 30 great-grandchildren.       
         Josephine DeNatale Butler, a dance educator, historian and author, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Mrs. Butler and her husband, Albert Butler, wrote "The Encyclopedia of Social Dance." She was also the founder and president of the Institute for Social Dance Studies in New York, dedicated to the preservation and documentation of the history of American social dancing.         In 1970, Mrs. Butler created the film, print and memorabilia archive of American social ballroom dancing at the dance division of the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts. For 50 years, she was the director of the Albert Butler School of Dance, which she and her husband founded in 1936.         The Butlers were a popular ballroom dance team for many years, performing in  Manhattan at the Ritz-Carlton, the Plaza and other hotels, as well as in Europe.         Mrs. Butler was born in New York City in 1911. Before taking up dance, she was a fashion consultant and high-fashion designer. She was a past president of  the International Dance Council and Dance Masters of America.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Anne Spivey Woodward, a museum director and former administrator of Brandywine Battlefield Park in Pennsylvania, died on Tuesday at Chester County Hospital in West Chester, Pa. A West Chester resident, she was 47.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Born in Decatur, Ga., Mrs. Woodward graduated from Mount Holyoke College in  1971 and earned a master's degree in history at the University of Delaware in 1973. That year she started her career as a director and museum curator for the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission.         She researched and oversaw the historical furnishings of Washington's Headquarters at Valley Forge for its Bicentennial restoration. She continued to  work for the commission as regional curator and administrator of the park at Brandywine Creek until 1989.         In 1977 and 1987 she had a major role in the 200th and 210th anniversary re-enactments of the Battle of the Brandywine, in which Washington's troops failed to check a British advance on Philadelphia. From 1989 until two years ago she served as the museum director of the Historical Society of Delaware.         Mrs. Woodward is survived by her husband, Roland H. Woodward; three daughters, E. Rebecca, 17, Hannah C., 13, and Sarah M., 9; her parents, Albert G. Spivey Jr. and Jane K. Spivey of Kennett Square, Pa., and her sister, J. Carlisle Spivey of Greenwich, Conn.       
         Mary Perot Nichols, the strong-willed former head of the television and radio stations operated by New York City, and a former columnist and city editor of The Village Voice, died yesterday in the hospice of the Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69.         She died of pancreatic cancer, her family said.         A friend and ally of Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor, for 40 years, Ms. Nichols twice served as president of the WNYC Communications Group, with two radio stations, WNYC-AM and WNYC-FM, and a television station, WNYC-TV, Channel  31, licensed and partly financed by the city.         Ms. Nichols's most lasting professional contribution may have been the creation of the WNYC Foundation in the late 1970's, founded to attract private funds so the communications group could survive despite dwindling city financing. The foundation is awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission to buy WNYC-AM and FM, which are to remain public stations. Last week, the F.C.C. cleared the way for the city to sell the commercial license for WNYC-TV to the ITT Corporation and Dow Jones, which plan to create a sports, financial and entertainment superstation.         Under Ms. Nichols's leadership, the radio station became an important contributor to the city's cultural life and a major producer of programs for National Public Radio, including "Kids America," a live call-in program for children that won several broadcasting awards.         Mayor Koch first appointed Ms. Nichols to head WNYC Communications in 1978 on the heels of the city's fiscal crisis, when budget-conscious politicians called  for sale of the stations. She not only kept them going but also began station renovations.         When she resigned after two years to become director of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, she tossed off a tart farewell: doing creative work  for the city-owned stations was, she said, "a little like trying to cook a gourmet meal with glue on the kitchen floor."         Ms. Nichols left WNYC because of a disagreement with Mayor Koch when he insisted that the radio station run "The John Hour," in which the names of nine  men convicted of patronizing prostitutes were read over WNYC-AM. Mr. Koch theorized that the embarrassing exposure would cut into the prostitution trade and also argued that the Mayor should be allowed to control programming. "The John Hour" ran only once, but there was an outcry, and Ms. Nichols was made "uncomfortable," Mr. Koch said.         But he wooed her back to lead the communications group from 1983 to 1990, when Mayor David N. Dinkins replaced her with his own choice. She then became a  visiting professor of journalism at New York University, a post she held until her death.         Born in York, Pa., Mary Perot grew up near Philadelphia and in Buffalo. Friends say her Main Line family offered her a choice: she could have a "coming-out tea" or a college education. She selected college and in 1948 graduated from Swarthmore College with a degree in political science.         She lived with her husband and three children in Greenwich Village, and was involved in local issues, particularly the effort to stop Robert Moses from putting a road through Washington Square Park. She kept nudging Dan Wolf, a founding editor of The Village Voice, to write about the park. He encouraged her to write about the danger to the park herself, and she did.         Soon she became a mainstay of the young newspaper, first as a reporter, then  as author of "Runnin' Scared," a column about city politics.         A competitive writer with a streak of indignation -- "Mary had the kind of anger that made abolitionists," said a former colleague, Jerry Tallmer, the writer -- she wrote extensively about organized crime and political corruption and was among the loudest critics of the Lower Manhattan Expressway and then Westway. Neither was built.         "Mary had spies everywhere," said Clark Whelton, a former Voice reporter who  is now a speechwriter for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "She seemed to know things  other people never found out. She would do the legwork herself, sit through long meetings, read documents nobody else would read, make connections nobody else would make."         Before she left the paper for good in the mid-1970's, she took two years off  to serve as a public relations aide in the city's Parks Department. It was a heady time, during Mayor John V. Lindsay's first term, and the energetic Parks Commissioner, Thomas P. F. Hoving, staged happenings -- concerts and other events to draw the public to the once placid parks.         "In the revolution of 1966, Mary was a key player," said Henry Stern, the current Commissioner of the Parks Department who was then its executive director. "Hoving was brand new to city government, but she knew all about it. He got the nickname Thomas P. F. Hoving, P. F. for Publicity Forever, but Mary Nichols made it happen."         Ms. Nichols soon grew disillusioned with Mr. Hoving and Mr. Lindsay, who became one of many favorite targets in her columns once she returned to The Voice in 1968.         As The Voice's city editor, she encouraged young writers and seemed to thrive on feuds with politicians and colleagues. Some accused her of trying to promote  the interests of Mr. Koch, her old friend. She acknowledged that she often agreed with him, but asserted that "when I disagreed with him, I let him have it."         Shortly after The Voice's founders sold it in the mid-1970's, a new editor dismissed Ms. Nichols. In 1977, she became communications director to Mayor Kevin S. White of Boston for just under a year. Then, after Mr. Koch's election  that year, she took on the WNYC job.         Ms. Nichols's marriage to Robert B. Nichols, a writer, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two daughters, Eliza Nichols of Williamsburg, Va., and Kerstin Nichols of Hartford, Vt.; a son, Duncan, of Thetford, Vt.; a brother, Charles Perot, and two grandchildren.       
         Shelley List, a novelist and a producer of the television series "Cagney and  Lacey," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 and lived in Venice, Calif.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Jonathan Estrin, who was also her longtime business partner.         Ms. List was born in Manhattan. She earned a bachelor's degree in literature from Reed College in 1951 and a master's degree in literature from Teachers College of Columbia University in 1952. In the 1960's she reviewed theater for the Westport News in Westport, Conn., and wrote feature articles for the Fairpress in Fairfield, Conn.         After writing the novels "Did You Love Daddy When I Was Born?" (1972) and "Nobody Makes Me Cry" (1975), Ms. List moved to California to try her hand at television writing. She sold her first treatment, which was made into the 1979 movie "And Baby Makes Six," with Colleen Dewhurst. Ms. List wrote the script.         Beginning in the 1980's, she and her husband created, wrote and produced the  mini-series "Between Friends," which was based on Ms. List's novel "Nobody Makes Me Cry"; "Daniel Steele's 'Jewels,' " "Amazing Grace" and "Barbara Taylor Bradford's 'Remember.' " Other television credits include the situation comedy "City," with Valerie Harper, and the pilot episode of "Sisters."         From 1986 to 1988, Ms. List and her husband were the supervising producers of "Cagney and Lacey, " a role they assumed when the original producer of the series, Terry Louise Fischer, left to develop "L.A. Law." They wrote the second  part of a two-episode drama in which Lacey recognizes and deals with her alcoholism.         Her first marriage, to Murray List, ended in divorce.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Julie List Faggella and Abigail List, both of Manhattan; two brothers, Peter Steinmann and  Daniel Steinmann; a stepson, Zachary Estrin, and a grandson.         Correction:         An obituary on Thursday about Shelley List, a television producer, misidentified the character who struggled with alcoholism in an episode of "Cagney and Lacey" written by Ms. List and her husband, Jonathan Estrin. The character was Cagney, not Lacey.         An obituary on Thursday about Shelley List, a television producer, misidentified the character who struggled with alcoholism in an episode of "Cagney and Lacey" written by Ms. List and her husband, Jonathan Estrin. The character was Cagney, not Lacey.       
         Bettina Bancroft, a former director of Dow Jones & Company, which publishes The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine, died on Tuesday, at her Los Angeles home. Ms. Bancroft, who was 55, also had a residence in Manhattan, where she was involved in foundation work.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Andrew Klink, said.         A great-granddaughter of Clarence W. Barron, who bought Dow Jones in 1902 from a co-founder, Charles H. Dow, she became a director in 1982 to represent the Bancroft and Barron family descendants. She retired from the board in April, but remained a director of the Dow Jones Foundation.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Bettina Gray of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.; a daughter, Elisabeth Goth of Del Mar, Calif.; three brothers, Christopher Bancroft of Denton, Tex., Hugh Bancroft 3d of Aspen, Colo., and William P. Liscomb 3d of Carlsbad, Calif., and a sister, Kathryn Kavadas of Waban, Mass.         A previous marriage, to Michael R. Goth, ended in divorce in 1974. A son, Michael B. Goth, died in 1990.       
         Arona Lipman McHugh, the author of four novels, two of them set in her native Boston, died on Wednesday at St. Vincent's Medical Center in Staten Island. She  was 71 and lived in the West Brighton section.         The cause was cardiac arrest, her family said.         Mrs. McHugh's first novel, written at the family's summer home in Sag Harbor, L.I., was "A Banner With a Strange Device" (1964). It prompted the critic Haskel Frankel to welcome her in The New York Times Book Review with an accolade, "The lady is a born storyteller." Unusual for a first effort, it became a best seller and a Literary Guild selection.         It was the tale of a group of former G.I.'s and their women who were trying to patch their lives together again in the late 1940's in Boston. A sequel, "The Seacoast of Bohemia" (1965), followed some of the same characters and their entanglements.         Mrs. McHugh then turned out a historical novel in 1969, "The Luck of the Van  Meers," which traced several generations of a Dutch-Jewish family. Her final novel, also historical, was "The Calling of the Mercenaries" (1977), which focused on occupied Germany after World War II.         Mrs. McHugh graduated in 1950 with one of the first groups to finish the writer's program at the University of Iowa. She earned a master's degree in library science at Columbia University the next year.         In World War II she served in the Women's Army Corps in the United States and in occupied Germany. Before becoming a published novelist, she worked as a children's librarian at the New York Public Library.         Her husband, Warren J. McHugh, a folk artist who kept an art gallery in Sag Harbor for many years, died in 1986. She is survived by two sons, Michael W., of Staten Island and Jonathan A., of Los Angeles, and a granddaughter.       
         Marion Sands Kirk, a supporter of the arts in New York, died on May 17 at the Auburn Manor nursing home in Washington Court House, Ohio, where she had lived for the last decade. She was 92.         From 1953 to 1968, Mrs. Kirk, the wife of a former Columbia University president, Dr. Grayson L. Kirk, organized a number of exhibitions on the campus  and at New York galleries to benefit art scholarships.         For more than 30 years, she was a trustee of the Home for Old Men and Aged Couples in Manhattan and its successor corporations, Amsterdam House and the Isaac Tuttle Fund. She was also a member of the council of the New York Botanical Garden.         She was born in Hillsboro, Ohio, studied art in Philadelphia and attended the University of Wisconsin.         Besides her husband of 70 years, who lives in Bronxville, N.Y., Mrs. Kirk is  survived by their son, John G., also of Bronxville, four granddaughters and two  great-grandchildren.       
         Constance Sullivan Carden, who helped plan Alice Tully Hall and was on the boards of the New York Philharmonic Orchestra and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, died on Thursday at her Manhattan home. She was 86.         Mrs. Carden was born in Manhattan, a daughter of Walter S. Sullivan, a New York Times advertising manager. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and from Bryn Mawr College.         She studied lieder singing in the 1930's and worked for the Office of Strategic Services, translating captured Nazi documents, in Washington during World War II. She was a singer during, and for some years after, the war.         Mrs. Carden was on the Philharmonic board from 1958 to 1978 and was chairwoman of its education committee, which developed programs to bring classical music into New York City public schools.         She was on the planning committee for Alice Tully Hall for several years before the hall opened, in Lincoln Center, in 1969. In that capacity, she mainly helped Alice Tully, the philanthropist for whom the building is named, raise funds for its construction. Mrs. Carden was on the board of the Chamber Music Society from 1969 to 1991.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. George A. Carden; three sons, Dr. George  Alexander Carden of Palm Beach, Fla., William of Manhattan and Timothy of Montclair, N.J.; a daughter, Constance of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and a sister, Jeanet Curtis of New Haven. Her brother, Walter Sullivan, a former science editor of The Times, died in March.       
         Dorothy Hyson, a Chicago-born stage and screen actress of the 1930's and 40's who was famed for her beauty, died on Thursday in a London hospital. She was 81  and had moved to London with her parents as a child.         She had been in declining health after suffering a stroke, The Times of London reported.         Miss Hyson's second husband, the actor and director Sir Anthony Quayle, once remarked: "It was not only her beauty that possessed me. It was a radiant lightness of heart."         She was often said to have inspired the 1935 Rodgers and Hart hit song "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World," with what The Guardian on Saturday called "her blue eyes, blond hair, and fragile singing and dancing style."         Miss Hyson made her screen debut as a child in the movie "Money Mad" and her  stage debut in London in a 1927 play, "Quality Street," by J. M. Barrie.         The Daily Telegraph said that on the London stage she "scored her greatest triumph in the thriller 'Pink String and Sealing Wax,' " which opened in 1943.         Her first marriage, to the actor Robert Douglas, ended in divorce. Sir Anthony died in 1989. Her mother, the musical-comedy star Dorothy Dickson, died  last year at the age of 102.         Miss Hyson is survived by two daughters and a son.       
         Angel Wallenda, who defied cancer by walking the high wire on an artificial limb after her right leg was amputated just below the knee, died yesterday at Robert Packer Hospital in Sayre, Pa. Ms. Wallenda was 28, and lived in Mansfield, Pa., about 25 miles southwest of Elmira, N.Y.         The hospital would not disclose the cause of death.         Ms. Wallenda, who was 17 and an utter novice on the high wire in 1985 when she married into the Wallenda family, famous for its aerialists and acrobats, gave her final performance on March 4, 1990, at Mansfield University.         She had already lost her leg and was facing cancer surgery for the third time in four years when a roaring crowd responded to her courage and skill at the event, sponsored by the university to help defray her medical expenses.         "When I'm way up in the sky, walking on a thin line with a fake leg, people look up at me and really pay attention," Ms. Wallenda said. "They see that I'm using everything I've got to live my life the best I can. When people think about that, it makes them think about themselves, and some of them see how much  better they can live their own lives.         "That's why I do what I do. Maybe that's my main purpose for being here."         The sixth of seven children, she was born into a family of Hungarian refugees who had fled Communism and settled in the suburbs north of New York City.         She was named Elizabeth Pintye (pronounced PEN-tya), and because her dour father beat his children frequently, Elizabeth grew up being shuttled between foster homes and her parents' home, being deprived of food, being beaten again,  sometimes running away, knowing bleak Christmases and using alcohol and marijuana. But she maintained a cheery exterior that disguised her resolve not to be controlled by others.         In "Angel on High," a biographical article that appeared in the March 1991 issue of Reader's Digest, she attributed her strength and courage to her difficult childhood.         "I'm so much stronger because of it," she said. "If I'd had a sheltered life  with people looking after me, I know I couldn't handle what's happened to me."         As Lizzie Pintye, she had sworn off drugs and alcohol and was working at the  Dipper Dan Ice Cream Shoppe in Mohegan Lake, N.Y., when she and Mr. Wallenda first noticed each other.         Later that day, she was attracted by music and a crowd to a shopping center parking lot, where she realized that Steven Wallenda, the man walking a high wire was the man who had been staring at her in the ice cream store.         When he invited her to join him on the wire in his next show, she accepted. "She was a natural," Mr. Wallenda said.         She said, "If I could learn the wire and become a performer, I knew it could  be the greatest adventure of my life."         From the beginning, he called her Angel.         Not long after they were married in New York City in August 1985, Ms. Wallenda began her training, but not long after that, she began spitting up blood and noticed a painful lump on her ankle, where she had suffered an injury  when she was 11.         Her right leg was amputated in 1987, and surgery removed parts of both her lungs in 1988. Nevertheless, she determined to walk the wire again. Her success  was recorded later that year on the ABC television show "Incredible Saturday," and she appeared at benefits for the American Cancer Society and the City of Hope Medical Center.         But her cancer recurred. She knew she would die, but she didn't want to know  how long doctors thought she might live. "I'm going to live my life to the fullest as long as I can," she said.         She and Mr. Wallenda, who were the parents of a son, Steven 2d, now 9, divorced. Ms. Wallenda remarried. She is survived by her husband, Adil Shaikh, of Mansfield, and an infant daughter.       
         Dr. Rachel Dunaway Cox, an emeritus professor of education and psychology at  Bryn Mawr College who was a leader in the field of child development, died on April 24 at the Quadrangle, a retirement village in Haverford, Pa. She was 92.         She retired in 1971 after 27 years on the faculty but continued to write and  lecture widely. At her death, she had been working on a 40-year study of the women she had written about in "Youth Into Maturity: A Study of Men and Women in the First 10 Years After College" (Mental Health Materials Center, 1970).         When she arrived at Bryn Mawr in 1944, she was appointed director of its Child Study Institute, which grew to national prominence during her tenure. In cooperation with local school systems, the center evaluated and treated children with educational and developmental problems.         When Dr. Cox started out, children who had trouble keeping up in school were  usually deemed unmotivated or defiant. She raised awareness that such children often suffered from complex impairments.         Dr. Cox was born in Murray, Ky., the daughter of a country doctor who served  as a role model as she accompanied him on his rounds in a horse-drawn buggy. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Texas in 1925, moved to New York and became a reporter at The Herald Tribune only to find herself relegated to "women's news."         Finding teaching more compatible, she received a master of arts degree at Columbia University and a Ph.D. in psychology, education and social work at the  University of Pennsylvania in 1943.         Dr. Cox is survived by a son, David, of Fort Wayne, Ind.; a daughter, Rosemary C. Masters of Manhattan; five grandchildren and a great-granddaughter. Her husband of 65 years, Dr. Reavis Cox, died in 1992.       
         Hedwig Adele van Ameringen, a philanthropist who was a major supporter of the New York Philharmonic, died on April 27 at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.         Mrs. van Ameringen, born Hedwig Pfaltz in Newark, first heard the Philharmonic as a child at Carnegie Hall and became the orchestra's friend for life. She had been a member of the board since 1980.         She gave $5 million in 1991 to establish the Hedwig van Ameringen Guest Artist Endowment Fund, which helped engage scores of the world's leading soloists to play with the Philharmonic.         Mrs. van Ameringen was also a supporter of Lincoln Center, the Philharmonic's home since it left Carnegie Hall. Another of her principal beneficiaries was Fountain House, which helps people with mental illness find housing, schooling and the way back to productive lives.         In 1919, she married Arnold Louis van Ameringen, a founder and later chairman of what has grown into a billion-dollar company, International Flavors and Fragrances, based in Manhattan. Her husband, who died in 1966, formed the van Ameringen Foundation in 1950 to support programs in mental health. At her death, Mrs. van Ameringen was the foundation's honorary chairwoman.         She is survived by two daughters, Lily Auchincloss of Manhattan and Patricia  Kind of Huntingdon Valley, Pa.; a son, Henry P., of Manhattan; 6 grandchildren,  and 15 great-grandchildren.       
         Patsy Montana, whose yodeling-cowgirl songs made her a pioneer in country music, died on Friday at her home in San Jacinto, Calif., The Associated Press reported. She was 81.         Ms. Montana had her biggest hit, "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart," in 1935, the first million-selling hit for a female country singer. It brought an assertive female voice to country music, as she announced her readiness to "rope and ride" and sang whooping high notes. Ms. Montana remained active for a career that lasted six decades.         Ms. Montana, who original name was Rubye Blevins, was born in Hot Springs, Ark., in 1914, and grew up in Hope, Ark., hearing the music of Jimmie Rodgers, country's "blue yodeler." She moved to California in 1930 with an older brother, and began performing on radio there after winning a talent contest. She joined the revue of a well-known country singer, Stuart Hamblen, in 1931, working with  a group called the Montana Cowgirls; Hamblen renamed her Patsy. She made her first recordings as Patsy Montana in 1932, and in 1933 she moved to Chicago to perform on WLS radio with the Prairie Ramblers.         She appeared regularly on the "National Barn Dance" program and recorded for  the American Record Corporation, usually accompanied by the Ramblers; she relocated with them to WOR radio in Manhattan in 1935. Along with "I Want to Be  a Cowboy's Sweetheart," which she wrote, her hits included "Shy Anne from Old Cheyenne," "The She Buckaroo," "Rodeo Sweetheart" and "I Wanna Be a Western Cowgirl." In 1939, she appeared with Gene Autry in the movie "Colorado Sunset."         During the 1940's, she recorded with the Sons of the Pioneers and the Light Crust Doughboys, and had a hit with "Goodnight, Soldier" during World War II. She returned to Arkansas in 1948, performing on radio there and at the Saturday-night "Louisiana Hayride" in Shreveport, La. When her husband, Paul Rose, was transferred to California, the family moved to the West Coast, and Ms. Montana went into temporary retirement during the 1950's.         But she returned to touring in the 1960's. In 1964, she made an album with a  band that included Waylon Jennings, little known at the time, on lead guitar. In the 1970's and 80's, she made albums for folk and bluegrass labels like Birch, Old Homestead and Flying Fish.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Beverly Losey, both of San Jacinto, and two brothers, Ira Blevins of Mena, Ark., and Kenneth Blevins of Florida.       
         She was just 17 when she climbed on the shoulders of Karl Wallenda in the debut performance of the Wallenda pyramid in Madison Square Garden in 1928. The  act brought the audience to its feet and stopped the Greatest Show on Earth for 11 minutes.         Helen Kreis Wallenda, who formed the pinnacle of the famous Wallenda high-wire pyramid many times during 30 years of performing, died on Thursday in  Sarasota. She was 85 and the last member of the original four-member Great Wallendas high-wire troupe. She was the widow of the group's founder, Karl Wallenda.         Mrs. Wallenda retired in 1956, six years before the seven-person pyramid fell in Detroit, killing two members of the troupe and leaving her adopted son,  Mario, paralyzed. Tragedy struck again in 1964 when her sister, Rietta Grotefent, died in a fall from the wire.         She was in San Juan, P.R., in 1978 when Karl Wallenda, whom she married in 1935, fell 10 stories to his death while trying to walk a wire strung between two hotels.         "My mother was not only the greatest aerialist in her field, she was a very dignified lady," said her daughter, Carla Wallenda Guzman. "She loved to perform, then she loved being grandma."         Ms. Guzman likes to tell the story about how her mother, at 72, helped her son-in-law, Mike Morgan, learn the wire act. "She got hold of my husband's shoulders and started climbing up on his shoulders as he balanced on a low wire," said Ms. Guzman, who had been performing in New York until she learned of her mother's illness earlier this week.         "She refused to watch us perform. It scared her."         Yet Helen Wallenda's specialty was climbing like a cat onto the shoulders of  her husband, while he was balanced on a chair on the wire.         She was born Dec. 11, 1910, in Germany and joined Karl Wallenda and his daredevil troupe when she was 16, touring throughout Europe.         She came to America in 1928 with the original Wallenda act of Karl and Herman Wallenda and Joe Geiger, and to Sarasota because it was the winter quarters of the Ringling show. She and her husband bought a two-story home in Sarasota where she cared for grandchildren when the rest of the family was touring.         In addition to her daughter, Carla, she is survived by two other children, Jenny Wallenda Anderson and Mario Wallenda; six grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren.       
         Pilar Lorengar, a Spanish soprano who was best known for her portrayals of Mozart heroines but whose repertory ranged from zarzuela to Puccini, Verdi and Wagner, died on Sunday at the Park Sanitarium in Berlin. She was 68 and lived in Berlin, where she was a star of the Deutsche Oper for more than 30 years.         Hans Boon, her publicity representative, said the cause was breast cancer.         Miss Lorengar had a bright, distinctive sound that was not to all tastes. Her detractors often pointed to her wide vibrato, a characteristic that is shared by many Spanish singers and has been described by Ms. Lorengar's admirers as an expressive shimmer. The vibrato aside, she was an attractive and vibrant singer who created a sense of feminine vulnerability in roles like the Countess  in "Le Nozze di Figaro," Dona Elvira in "Don Giovanni" or Mimi in "La Boheme," but could also be a commanding Tosca and a lively Fiordiligi in "Cosi fan Tutte."         Although she sang with orchestras and opera companies all over the world, and made recordings with many conductors and ensembles, she was unusual in that she  considered a single company, the Berlin Deutsche Oper, her artistic home. Miss Lorengar made her debut there in Orff's "Carmina Burana" in 1958, when the company was called the Berlin City Opera, and quickly became a favorite of Berlin audiences and critics. When the company opened its new house in 1961, it  was with a production of "Don Giovanni" in which she sang Donna Elvira.         Miss Lorengar sang most of the major Mozart roles in Berlin, as well as Wagner's Elsa in "Lohengrin" and Eva in "Die Meistersinger," the title roles in Puccini's "Manon Lescaut," "Madama Butterfly," "Tosca" and "Suor Angelica," and Verdi's Desdemona in "Otello," Violetta in "La Traviata" and Alice Ford in "Falstaff." She was made a lifetime member of the Deutsche Oper in 1984, when the company staged a 25th-anniversary gala for her. And it was in Berlin that she gave her last operatic performance, as Tosca on June 9, 1990.         She also performed often at the Metropolitan Opera, where she made her debut  as Donna Elvira in 1966. At the Met she sang several of the Mozart, Puccini, Verdi and Wagner roles that were also in her Berlin repertory, as well as Antonia in Offenbach's "Conte d'Hoffmann," Micaela in Bizet's "Carmen" and Agathe in Weber's "Freischutz." Her last appearance at the Met was as Fiordiligi in 1982. Her last appearance in New York was a recital at the 92d Street Y in 1987.         Miss Lorengar was born Pilar Lorenza Garcia -- Lorengar is a combination of her middle and last names -- in Saragossa, Spain, on Jan. 16, 1928. She became fond of singing after she joined the choir of the convent school she attended as a child, and was smitten with zarzuela when she heard it through the earphone of a homemade radio made for her by a neighbor. Before she undertook formal vocal studies, she was hired by Radio Saragossa as a member of its zarzuela troupe.         In the mid-1940's, Miss Lorengar moved to Madrid, where she studied with Angeles Ottein and sang in a zarzuela company for several years before she decided to change her focus to the more conventional operatic roles. She made her international opera debut, as Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro," at Aix-en-Provence, in 1955. The same year she made her American debut in a concert version of Granados's "Goyescas" with the Little Orchestra Society in New York.  She made her American operatic debut as Liu in Puccini's "Turandot" at the San Francisco Opera in 1964, and maintained a close relationship with that company over the next 25 years.         Miss Lorengar's discography includes recordings of Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice," Mozart's "Zauberflote" and Verdi's "Traviata" (all on London Records) and Hindemith's "Mathis der Maler" (on Deutsche Grammophon).         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jurgen Schaff, and a brother, Luis Garcia Seta, of Madrid.       
         Beatrice Procter Frelinghuysen, the wife of one Congressman and mother of another, who was on the boards of nonprofit organizations in the fields of botany and ballet, died on Monday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown, N.J., where she lived. She was 77.         The cause was complications from pneumonia, said her son Peter.         Mrs. Frelinghuysen was a member of a family that has long been prominent in  New Jersey's public life. She was the wife of Peter H. B. Frelinghuysen, a Republican who represented north central New Jersey in the House from 1953 through 1974. He is related to four earlier Frelinghuysens who were United States senators, one of whom, Frederick T., became a Secretary of State under President Chester A. Arthur.         She and her husband had five children, including Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, also a Republican Congressman from north central New Jersey, who was elected in  1994.         At her death, Mrs. Frelinghuysen was on the board of the Berkshire Botanical  Garden in Stockbridge, Mass. In the 1980's, she was on the board of the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii.         In addition, she was for some years a member of the advisory committee of the School of American Ballet, which is part of the Lincoln Center complex.         Mrs. Frelinghuysen was a native of Manhattan, the daughter of Rodney Procter, a stockbroker and investor, and the former Beatrice Sterling.         Besides her husband of 56 years and her sons Peter, of Manhattan, and Rodney, of Morristown, she is survived by another son, Frederick, of Tucson, Ariz.; two  daughters, Beatrice van Roijen of Washington and Adaline Ogilvie-Laing of Manhattan, 13 grandchildren and a sister, Mrs. Anson Phelps Stokes Jr.       
         Lucille Darvin Maurer, a Maryland legislator whose expertise in public finance led her to the post of State Treasurer, died on Monday at her home in Silver Spring. She was 73.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         Mrs. Maurer, a Democrat, represented Montgomery County for 18 years in the House of Delegates, the lower house of the General Assembly, Maryland's legislature.         The General Assembly elected her Treasurer in 1987. Stricken by her fatal illness, she resigned in January.         Mrs. Maurer, a native of New York City, graduated in economics from the University of North Carolina and earned a master's degree in general studies at  Yale.         She is survived by her husband of 51 years, Ely Maurer; three sons, Stephen B., of Swarthmore, Pa., Russell A., of Pepper Pike, Ohio, and Edward N., of Lido Beach, L.I.; a brother, Eugene Darvin of Pearl River, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.       
         Miriam Gideon, a prolific composer of vocal, chamber and orchestral music, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Ms. Gideon's music was often lean in texture but driven by a lyrical impulse  and an intensity that clarified the texts she set. In her song cycles, she sometimes mixed poetry from different centuries and in different languages, with an eye toward illuminating a common theme. She was a modernist, and did not shun rhythmic complexity or free atonality when those qualities suited her needs; yet when she used angular lines or abrasive harmonies, it was always to point up an  emotional or dramatic element in the work at hand.         Her vocal works included an opera, "Fortunato" (1958), a set of Shakespeare  settings for voice and orchestra (1951), several song cycles on natural and philosophical themes, including "Questions on Nature" (1964), "The Seasons of Time" (1969) and "Creature to Creature" (1985), and song settings in French, Japanese, German, Greek, Latin and Hebrew.         A specialist in Jewish liturgical music, and a composition teacher at the Jewish Theological Seminary, Ms. Gideon composed many settings of Hebrew prayers, both for chorus and solo voice, including a complete Sabbath service.         Ms. Gideon also created a varied catalogue of instrumental works, including a Symphonia Brevis (1951), a String Quartet (1946), sonatas for flute (1943), viola (1948), cello (1967) and piano (1977). She sometimes combined exotic elements -- as in the "Fantasy on a Javanese Motive" (1948) -- with her own contemporary American style.         Ms. Gideon was born in Greeley, Colo., on Oct. 23, 1906, and grew up in Boston, where she began studying the piano at age 9, and composing soon thereafter. After doing her undergraduate work at Boston University, she earned  a master's degree in musicology at Columbia University in 1946, and studied composition privately with Lazare Saminsky and Roger Sessions. She taught composition at Brooklyn College, City College of the City University of New York, the Manhattan School of Music and the Jewish Theological Seminary, and it  was at the seminary that she earned her doctorate in composition -- after nearly a quarter century as a teacher -- in 1970.         Although she was often cited as a role model for women who wanted to make their careers as composers, Ms. Gideon was always ambivalent about her status as a pioneering woman, and she disapproved of concert and broadcast series that presented only women's works.         "I didn't know I was a woman composer until the 1960's," she said in a 1986 interview. "I knew I was a composer -- a young composer for many years, and then, suddenly, an older composer. But never a woman composer."         Ms. Gideon's husband of 40 years, the author Frederic Ewen, died in 1989. She is survived by a sister, Judith Gideon of Manhattan; a daughter-in-law, Petra Ewen of Roanoke, Va., and three grandchildren.       
         Kathleen Haberthur-Williams, a theatrical press agent, died on Wednesday in the burn unit of New York University-Cornell Medical Center. She was 41 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was complications of severe burns suffered in an accident at her home on April 27, said Philip Rinaldi, a colleague.         Ms. Haberthur-Williams began her career as a press agent in music and theater in her home town, Detroit, notably at the Chene Park Music Theater. She was also the in-house press agent for the Fisher and Masonic Temple theaters, owned by the Nederlander Organization.         After moving to New York City in 1992, she worked as a press agent for Broadway, Off Broadway and national touring productions, including the 1994 revival of "Medea," "Blood Brothers," "Pounding Nails in the Floor With My Forehead" and "The Night Larry Kramer Kissed Me."         From 1993 to 1995, she handled publicity for Here, a performing arts center in SoHo. Most recently, she worked on the national tour of "Ain't Misbehavin',"  with the Pointer Sisters.         She is survived by her husband, Steve Williams; a daughter, Sarah Haberthur;  her parents, Margaret and Charles Buchanan, of Winter Haven, Fla., and three brothers, Charles Buchanan of Winter Haven and Ross and Keith Buchanan, both of  Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Margaret Bronson (Peggy) Clark, who designed the lighting for more than 60 Broadway productions, including "Brigadoon," "Bye Bye Birdie" and "Auntie Mame," died on Wednesday at her home in Lexington, Ga. She was 80.         She died after a series of strokes, said Elmon Webb, a friend.         Ms. Clark helped make lighting design a profession on Broadway and was one of the first women to achieve a career in the field. "She was a pioneer in creating the field," said Mr. Webb, a business agent for United Scenic Artists,  the union that represents lighting, scenic and costume designers.         Through the 1930's, lighting design was a relatively informal process, usually the province of electricians.  Ms. Clark got her first job as a lighting designer on Broadway in 1941. Her work caught the attention of Brooks Atkinson,  the drama critic of The New York Times.         She worked as an assistant to Oliver Smith on "On the Town" in 1944. Her work tended toward the naturalistic, not the experimental. "Peggy Clark's lighting gives the production a cool appearance," Mr. Atkinson noted in a 1958 review of  "The Threepenny Opera."         Ms. Clark designed the lighting for a number of George Abbott's shows, including "Paint Your Wagon," a revival of "Pal Joey," and "Wonderful Town." "George Abbot liked plenty of light downstage," Ms. Clark told The New Haven Register in 1955, "because that's where he plays all the comedy scenes."         Dame Judith Anderson, for whom Ms. Clark designed the lighting for the 1947 production of "Medea," demanded simply to "be seen," Ms. Clark said. The equipment arrived late, there was no time to rehearse and "Ms. Anderson usually  left the spot just before the light got to it."         Ms. Clark was born in Baltimore to an academic family. Her father, Dr. Eliot  R. Clark, was later a professor of anatomy at the University of Pennsylvania. Ms. Clark wanted to be an actress, but, she told The New Haven Register, "I grew so tall I was cast only in men's parts."         In 1935, she graduated from Smith College. She went on to Yale, where she studied in the Department of Drama and Design, getting her master of fine arts degree in 1938.         In 1968, Ms. Clark was elected president of the United States Scenic Artists, Local 829, the first woman to hold that job. She taught lighting design at Smith College in 1967 and 1969, and at Yale Drama School in 1969 and 1970.         For many years, she lived in Brooklyn Heights, where she kept bulldogs. She was a president of the French Bull Dog Club of America.         Ms. Clark's husband, Lloyd R. Kelley, a theatrical electrician, died in 1972. She is survived by a brother, Douglas N. Clark, a professor of mathematics at the University of Georgia in Athens.       
         Mollie H. Beattie, who resigned as director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on June 6 because of failing health, died on Thursday at Grace  Cottage Hospital in Townsend, Vt. She was 49 and lived in Grafton and Alexandria, Va.         The cause was brain cancer, said a friend, Alexandra M. Marks.         A forester by training, Ms. Beattie was the first woman to head the agency.  In three years as director, she defended the Endangered Species Act against attacks from many Republicans in Congress and fought efforts to reduce the agency's budget, not always successfully.         "In the Clinton Administration, she was probably the strongest single voice for wildlife conservation," said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of the Defenders of Wildlife, a nonprofit group that works to protect and preserve species.         Ms. Beattie was a strong proponent of the effort to have gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park for the first time since the 1920's. Mr. Schlickeisen  said one of his most vivid memories of her was seeing her rub cold water on the  belly of a wild wolf at Yellowstone in April to cool it so the animal could be moved to another site for release. Despite the rain in her face, he recalled, she smiled broadly and said, "Any day I can touch a wild wolf is a good day."         As director, she was responsible for the wildlife service's 7,000 employees and an annual budget for resource management of $501 million in the current fiscal year, down from $511 million the previous year. The agency, part of the Interior Department, enforces wildlife laws, administers the Endangered Species  Act and carries out wetland protection and management. John Rogers has been serving as acting director.         Ms. Beattie sought to conserve species by managing entire ecosystems rather than waiting until individual species became endangered, and presided over the addition of 15 national wildlife refuges to a system that now has 508.         The agency said that under her direction 140 habitat conservation plans were  established and 300 more were being developed. These plans are formal agreements between landowners and the Fish and Wildlife Service that allow the owners to harm individual members of a species listed as endangered or threatened if they  take steps to help the species as a whole to recover.         She argued that such plans demonstrated that the Endangered Species Act, under which they are carried out, has the flexibility to conserve species while  allowing economic development. In fact, she said, the act "has been one of the biggest success stories of the conservation movement in America," contending that many myths had been spread about the act's supposedly onerous effects.         Just before she resigned, she led efforts to resume the listing of endangered species after a 13-month moratorium imposed by Congress, which sharply cut the agency's money for such listings in the current fiscal year.         Earlier this month, Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, introduced legislation in the House and Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, in the Senate to name an eight-million-acre wilderness in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge after her.         Mollie Beattie was born on April 27, 1947, in Glen Cove, L.I. She earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., in 1968 and a master's degree in forestry at the University of Vermont in 1979. She also received a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University in 1991.         She was program director and lands manager for the Windham Foundation, a nonprofit organization that conducts seminars on critical issues facing Vermont, from 1983 to 1985; commissioner of the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and  Recreation from 1985 to 1989, and deputy secretary of the state's Agency of Natural Resources from 1989 to 1990. She left to become executive director of a  public policy institute, the Richard A. Snelling Center for Government in Vermont, before taking her post at the Fish and Wildlife Service.         She is survived by her husband, Rick Schwolsky of Grafton; her mother, Patricia Beattie of Ketchum, Idaho, and a sister, Jane Beattie, also of Ketchum.       
         Dr. Constance B. Wofsy, a medical professor and clinician who created a program to educate health workers about advances in AIDS treatments, died on Monday at her home in San Francisco. She was 53.         The cause was breast cancer, according to the University of California at San Francisco, where she was a faculty member. Dr. Wofsy was also co-director of the AIDS Program and associate chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General Hospital.         As co-founder of the hospital's AIDS Program in 1983 with Dr. Paul Volberding, she was influential in providing medical services for young gay men  early in the AIDS epidemic. She also created and directed a program that has attracted hundreds of health professionals to the hospital from around the world to learn about the latest techniques in AIDS care.         Early in the epidemic she recognized that women were at risk and founded an organization in San Francisco called Aware (Association for Women's AIDS Research and Education), which offered confidential testing for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and counseling. It published some of the earliest data on the prevalence of H.I.V. infection in women at high risk in the San Francisco area.         Dr. Wofsy was the founding chairwoman of the Women's Health Committee of the  AIDS Clinical Trials Group of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. The group oversees and carries out studies of various therapies for AIDS.         She was one of the first AIDS experts to address the issue of workplace discrimination against H.I.V.-infected people, and provided education and training materials on the issue to corporations in San Francisco.         Constance Wofsy was born in Cheltenham, Pa., on Oct. 6, 1942. She earned a bachelor's degree in bacteriology at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964 and a medical degree at the University of Southern California at Los Angeles in 1971. She joined the faculty of the University of California at San Francisco in 1975 and became a full professor in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, David, who is also a medical professor at the university, a son, Kevin, and a daughter, Susan, all of San Francisco, and her mother, Ruth Blitman, of Novato, Calif.       
         Laurel Weiner, a national associate and former national vice president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on June 2 at Portsbridge Hospice in Atlanta. An Atlanta resident, she was 68.         The cause was cancer, the family said.         Mrs. Weiner, a native of Brooklyn, attended the University of Georgia. She devoted most of her spare time to volunteer work for civic organizations and the cause of Zionism. She was a delegate to three World Zionist Congresses and a leader in many national, regional and local Jewish groups.         She was on the board of the Atlanta Community Council and the Community Planning Council. She was also a former president of the Southeast Region of Hadassah.         Mrs. Weiner is survived by her husband, Charles J., a daughter, Toby White, two sons, Barry and Steve, a sister, Miriam Komesar, and a brother, Saul Weinberg, all of Atlanta, and seven grandchildren.       
         Theodora Ayer Randolph, who rode the Virginia hunt country long enough and well enough to become known as the first lady of fox hunting, died on Tuesday at her Oakley Farm home in Upperville, Va. She was 90.         It had been years since Mrs. Randolph had donned her dark-blue, gold-collared coat, tucked her auburn hair under her helmet and galloped off over the vast expanse of farmland that makes up the grounds of the 150-year-old landowners' association known as the Piedmont Hunt. But as a master of the Piedmont, she had remained an indispensable presence in the affairs of the nation's oldest and largest fox-hunting entity.         In an area 45 miles west of Washington, where generations-old farms are sometimes acquired by city-bred newcomers unaccustomed to seeing a horde of horsemen thunder across their front yards in pursuit of a pack of hounds in pursuit of a fox, no respecter of property lines, after all, it would be Mrs. Randolph's duty to pay the newcomers a call. Over a cup of tea, perhaps, she would acquaint them with the customs and traditions of the neighborhood, assuring them that the members of the Piedmont Hunt were always careful to close gates they might have opened and to not trample any flower beds near the house.         As a clincher, she would note that as landowners, the newcomers would be eligible to join the Piedmont, an act that would instantly elevate them to the upper reaches of Virginia society.         The widow of Dr. Archibald Cary Randolph, a landed surgeon whose family helped settle Virginia, Mrs. Randolph succeeded her husband as hunt master after his death in 1959. But she was something of a newcomer herself. In an area where the first families of Virginia can be downright condescending to those who trace their ancestry to only the second wave of settlers, Mrs. Randolph achieved social prominence and fox-hunting distinction despite the fact that she was an actual Yankee.         Mrs. Randolph was born Sept. 27, 1905, in Beverly Farms, Mass., and learned to ride at the age of 3. Her father was master of the local Myopia Hunt, and she was fox hunting long before she saw Virginia.         Even so, she readily acknowledged that she received some of her most vivid training in advanced fence-jumping during Virginia visits to her daredevil uncle, General George S. Patton.         Mrs. Randolph -- whose first marriage, to the Massachusetts-born New York investment banker Robert Winthrop, ended in divorce -- married well twice and was born better.         Her father, Charles Ayer, was a member of the family that settled Ayer, Mass., and made a considerable fortune dealing in woolens and patent medicines,  including the 19th-century tonic rage, sarsaparilla.         After her divorce, Mrs. Randolph, who had fallen in love with the Virginia hunt country during her years at Foxcroft, a Virginia boarding school, settled there and renewed her acquaintance with Dr. Randolph, whom she had known as the  dashing master of the Piedmont Hunt during her boarding school days.         After their marriage in 1941, she became active in every aspect of equestrian affairs, breeding show and steeplechase champions, leading a drive to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs and receiving numerous honors for her work, including an honorary degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.         But it was as a highly accomplished horsewoman, one who could take the lead in an organization that prides itself on being the nation's fastest hunt ("Keep  up or go home" is one of its official rules), that she won greatest acclaim.         It was a tribute to her standing, and her reputation for social observation,  that in her later years newcomers tended to come to her.         In an area of such sprawling acreage and long driveways that next-door neighbors tend to drive over when they visit, Mrs. Randolph lived next door to Paul Mellon, not that she could actually see the Pittsburgh banking heir's house from her own.         But she could see his private landing strip from her parlor window and took wry delight in the extravagant idiosyncrasies of the very wealthy. Whenever she  would see the Mellons's private plane land and then take off 10 minutes later, her step-granddaughter and farm manager, Becky Armstrong, recalled yesterday, Mrs. Randolph would take a sip of her tea and nod knowingly: It was only Mrs. Mellon, she would say, come home to fetch a scarf.         Mrs. Randolph is survived by three children from her first marriage, Theodora Hooton of Glen Head, N.Y., Amory Winthrop of Millbrook, N.Y., and Cornelia Bonnie of Prospect, Ky.; five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Emma Bowen, a lifelong advocate for community causes and the rights of minorities whose reach extended to Washington, where she challenged broadcasters' and politicians' hiring practices, died last Monday at her home in Washington Heights. She was 81.         Mrs. Bowen was an outspoken advocate of the disenfranchised and vulnerable, particularly the young, as president of the Foundation of Minority Interests. The group was an outgrowth of a volunteer organization, Black Citizens for Fair  Media, that focused on the employment practices of broadcasters and their portrayal of blacks on television.         The group set up advisory boards at WABC-TV and WNBC-TV in 1972. As a result, the stations hired community-affairs directors and took steps to adjust  their programming, employment and training policies. A former neighborhood worker in the mayoral campaign of John V. Lindsay, she was later executive secretary of what is now the city's Department of Mental Health, Mental Retardation and Alcoholism Services.         Mrs. Bowen was born in Spartanburg, S.C., and moved to New York during the Depression to live with an aunt. She graduated from Fordham University.         Mrs. Bowen's husband, Marion, died in 1943. She is survived by three daughters, Marian Sanderson of Queens, Antoinette Perlez of Manhattan, and Gloria Jones, also of Queens; a brother, William Smith of Manhattan; four sisters, Lillie Ruth and Christine of Queens, Sarah of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Eunice of Spartanburg; seven grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Sophia Delza Glassgold, a modern dancer and teacher and an expert in the ancient Chinese exercise form called tai chi, died on June 27 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.         She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         A graduate of Hunter College, she trained as a modern dancer and toured the  United States performing Spanish and modern dance during the 1920's.         She also performed with her sister, Elizabeth, in the late 1920's at the Neighborhood Playhouse.         She lived in Shanghai from 1948 to 1951 and was the first American dancer to  teach modern dance in Chinese theater and dance schools.         Ms. Delza also became an expert on Chinese theatrical dancing after studying  action dance roles in the classical Chinese theater with Wang Fu-Ying and Cheng  Chuan-Chien.  She gave lectures and dance recitals on the material throughout the United States.         She founded the Delza School of Tai Chi Chuan at Carnegie Hall in 1954 and later taught at schools including the State University of New York at Purchase,  the Actor's Studio and the University of Hawaii.         She also taught and lectured on tai chi in live appearances and on television, writing the first book in English on the subject.         Her writings on esthetics, dance and theater arts and exercise and health have been published in China, in Europe and in American journals that include Dance Observer, the Theater Drama Review and the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism.         Ms. Delza also published a record album on teaching tai chi and wrote four books on tai chi and modern dance, including "The Tai Chi Chuan Experience," published this year by the State University of New York Press.         Ms. Delza's husband, A. Cook Glassgold, an official of the Joint Distribution Committee in Shanghai and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency, died in 1985.         She is survived by her sister, of Manhattan.       
         Bea Dolen, the unflappable ringmaster who oversaw the often chaotic election  process in New York City for 14 years beginning in 1974, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 83 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was a massive stroke, her family said.         As executive director of the Board of Elections, she was in charge of its day-to-day operations, from voter registration through certification of the winners. She dispensed advice to the public on how to find the right voting booth in the right district.         Once nominations were complete, Mrs. Dolen was responsible for getting the right names in the right place on the right ballots. She commanded the forces that moved the machinery into the booths. She also took care of absentee ballots, not to mention petitions and appeals. It was a year-round proposition,  encompassing everything from local school board elections to special elections and capped by the November stampede for borough, city, state and national office every two years.         Mrs. Dolan worked to loosen regulations that kept some New Yorkers from casting votes. During her tenure, registration by mail became possible, as did phone registration under the "Voter 88" program. She also saw the fruits of a computerization program begun by the board in 1986. Two years earlier, when a backlog of 90,000 registrations threatened a particularly hectic Election Day, she calmed the doomsayers. She assured them: "I don't have a problem. Put that in bold type. We have a challenge. We are meeting it."         Betty Bernstein, known as Bea, was born in Brooklyn. She studied at a commercial college and became a legal secretary. She took part in local politics as a member of the Jefferson Democratic Club, a component of the Tammany Hall machine that orchestrated Democratic politics for generations. Its boss, Carmine DeSapio, procured a job for her as secretary to the president of the Board of Elections in 1964, and she did the rest.         Mrs. Dolen is survived by three sisters, Sophie Lipschitz of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Minnie Finke of Manhattan, and Ida Rutsky of Hempstead, L.I. Her husband,  Irving Dolen, died 12 years ago.       
         Bertha Schizer, who started working as a pharmacist in Brooklyn when that profession was dominated by men, died on July 3 at University Hospital in Brooklyn. A longtime Brooklyn resident, she was 102.         Mrs. Schizer was born in Bialystok, in what is now Poland, and she came to the United States with her family after an organized persecution of Jews there in 1905. She was a descendant of generations of Hebrew scholars and teachers.         She graduated from Long Island University College of Pharmacy in 1918 and was active in her profession for more than 50 years.         Mrs. Schizer worked in pharmacies and hospital dispensaries in various parts  of the borough, retiring from a pharmacy in Flatbush in the mid-1970's.         Mrs. Schizer is survived by a son, Zevie B., and four grandchildren. Her husband, David Schizer, died in 1960.       
         Gioia Marconi Braga, the founder and chairwoman of the privately supported Marconi International Fellowship Council, who promoted scientific and cultural relations between Italy and the United States, died on Monday at Englewood Hospital. She was 80 and lived in Alpine, N.J.         Mrs. Braga was born in London, a daughter of the Marchese Guglielmo Marconi,  the Italian developer of wireless telegraphy and 1909 Nobelist in physics. She was educated in Italy and later worked in radio and television, in Rome for the  state-run RAI, and in New York for NBC.         The fellowship, which she founded in 1974, annually commissions creative work by scientists and scholars who have shown a commitment to humanistic goals  in science and technology.         For many years, she also served as a director of the Institute of International Education and the Spoleto Festival of Two Worlds. She was on the boards of Polytechnic University of Brooklyn and the Center for Italian Studies  at Columbia University.         She is survived by a son, Michael, of Tampa, Fla.; a daughter, Allegra, of Manhattan; a sister, Degna Paresce of Rome, and two grandchildren. Her husband of 31 years, George Atkinson Braga, died in 1985.       
         Frances J. Tyler, longtime owner and operator of the Tyler Place, a family resort in Highgate Springs, Vt., died last Friday at the Northwest Medical Center in the nearby town of St. Albans. She was 92 and lived on the grounds she managed.         Mrs. Tyler and her husband, Edward J. Tyler Jr., started the business in 1933, when they and other members of their family bought a dairy farm in Highgate Springs. It has since grown into a 165-acre resort on Lake Champlain three miles from the Canadian border.         Mrs. Tyler was born in Cape Girardeau, Mo., graduated from the University of Missouri and earned a master's degree in English and education at Cornell University. She studied briefly at the Sorbonne and, like her husband, started a career in publishing in New York before settling in Vermont.         Her husband died in 1969. Mrs. T, as she preferred to be known, remained active in the management of the Tyler Place, although in recent years she shared the task with her daughter and son.         Besides her daughter, Pixley T. Hill, and son, Edward J. Tyler 3d, both of St. Albans, she is survived by 10 grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Natalie Lieberman, the founder and president of Learning Through Art/The Guggenheim Museum Children's Program and a member of the museum's board, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 86 and lived on the Upper East  Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Lieberman was born in Brooklyn. She studied piano at the Juilliard School and acting at the Theater Guild. She was a lead in Eugene O'Neill's "Marco's Millions" on Broadway and in Yiddish Theater.         In the 1950's, she owned a millinery store, James Joel, on Madison Avenue.         Her first husband, Sidney J. Kovner, died in 1963. She is survived by her second husband, Dr. Joseph Lieberman, two sons, Anthony R. Kovner of Manhattan and Joel W. Kovner of Santa Monica, Calif., and six grandchildren.       
         Sarah Powell Huntington, who spent her life in social service, dealing with mental health issues and, particularly, the fate of women released from prison,  died on June 23 at her home in St. James, L.I. She was 89.         Upholding the Quaker tradition of her family, she was a mainstay of the Women's Prison Association and Home on Manhattan's Lower East Side for almost 70 years.         Two ancestors, Isaac T. Hopper and his daughter, Abigail Hopper Gibbons, founded the association in 1844; she was president from 1957 to 1967.         Mrs. Huntington had been on the board of the association since 1925 and remained active until recently. For her initiation, she escorted women from the  prison's door to the association's Hopper Home, a halfway house offering shelter and food and a guiding hand in the search for a job and a new life.         One of Mrs. Huntington's legacies was Sarah Powell Huntington House on 10th Street and Avenue B. It met a longstanding goal to reunite families in the face  of statistics that show three quarters of women prisoners to be mothers and at least a third to be homeless.         A new addition, opened three years ago, provided help for former convicts who otherwise would not have had their children restored to them. It sheltered them, 28 at a time, in a drug-free, supervised environment.         Mrs. Huntington, a native of Manhattan, was a past chairman of the Suffolk County Mental Health Board.         She also worked with related local and state agencies, including the State Association of Community Mental Health Boards, of which she was a former president.         Her husband of more than 50 years, Prescott Butler Huntington, a former state assemblyman, died in 1988. She is survived by two sons, Francis C. and Lawrence  S., both of Manhattan; two daughters, Sarah H. Fletcher of Locust Valley, L.I.,  and Susan H. Fisher of Greenwich, Conn.; 12 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Peg Weiss, an art historian, research professor and leading scholar on the Russian modernist Wassily Kandinsky, died on Wednesday at her home in Syracuse.  She was 63.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Volker Weiss, said.         In 1982, Mrs. Weiss was the curator of "Kandinsky in Munich" at the Solomon  R. Guggenheim Museum. She also wrote three books on the artist: "Kandinsky and Old Russia: The Artist as Ethnographer and Shaman," (Yale University Press, 1995); "Kandinsky in Munich, 1896-1914," the catalogue for the Guggenheim exhibition, and "Kandinsky in Munich: The Formative Jugendstil Years," (Princeton University Press, 1979).         Besides being a research professor at Syracuse University, Mrs.  Weiss was also a Getty scholar from 1989 to 1990. Before that she was the chief curator of the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, from 1979 to 1980, and the curator of collections there from 1975 until 1979.         Mrs. Weiss was born in Denver and reared in Massachusetts. In 1950, she moved to Syracuse to study art history, earning her B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Syracuse University. In 1956 she won a scholarship to study art history in Munich, and it was there that she became interested in Kandinsky's life and work.         She taught courses on modern art at colleges and universities across the country, including Cornell University and Columbia University. She was a guest curator at the Guggenheim Museum from 1979 until 1982.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Weiss is survived by two sons, Erick, of Los Angeles and Christopher, of Syracuse.       
         Faithful followers of soap operas have learned over the years that after a brief and bitter first marriage a young single mother can find love, marriage and singular professional success with a much older man, but now the question is:         Can a career woman who sacrificed her leisure to keep a nation of enthralled  housewives glued to their radios for the better part of two decades survive a heart-wrenching regimen of producing as many as 90 cliff-hanging episodes a week to live a full, rich and long life?         No need to stay tuned or wait for a toothpaste commercial. It can now be revealed that when she died in bed at her Fifth Avenue apartment on July 5, Anne Hummert, the woman widely credited with creating the radio soap opera and spinning out many of the classics of the 1930's and 40's, was a 91-year-old multimillionaire who had maintained a vigorous life almost to the end.         At a time when televised soap operas have become a postfeminist cultural sideshow, it is hard to imagine the era when "Stella Dallas," "Helen Trent," "Ma Perkins" and "Lorenzo Jones" were more than household names, and when virtually  every woman in America knew that Mary Noble was the "Backstage Wife" and were familiar with every detail of the anguished but inspiring lives of "John's Other Wife" and "Young Widow Brown."         It is even harder to imagine that all of these plus more than a dozen others  were the creations of a diminutive dynamo from Baltimore and the man she kept at bay for seven years after taking a job as his assistant at a Chicago advertising agency.         By the time she met E. Frank Hummert in 1927, the former Anne Schumacher had  lived something of a soap opera herself. A brilliant student who graduated magna cum laude from Goucher College at age 20 in 1925, she had begun her career as a  college correspondent for The Sun, then worked as a Sun reporter before going to Paris in 1926.         She became a reporter for the precursor of The International Herald Tribune her first day in the city, but within a year she had married and divorced a fellow reporter, John Ashenhurst, and was back in the United States with an infant son.         Settling in Chicago, she failed to get a newspaper job but became an assistant to Mr. Hummert, a former St. Louis newspaperman who had become a renowned copywriter and a partner in the Chicago agency Blackett, Sample & Hummert.         He was some two decades older than she and a confirmed bachelor, but then he  had never met a woman quite like his captivating 22-year-old assistant with the  tinkling voice, who was such a fount of ideas and organized efficiency that she became a vice president just two years later.         She, on the other hand, had already been married to one newspaperman, thank you, and was in no hurry to marry another. The couple didn't marry until 1934, when they began what friends recall as one of the great love matches, which lasted until Mr. Hummert's death in 1966.         At a time when commercial programming in the infant medium concentrated on working people who returned home to sit in front of their radios at night, advertisers were dimly aware that the housewives who stayed home all day were the nation's primary purchasing agents. But these women were considered too busy to pay more than cursory attention to the family radio.         The Hummerts didn't argue with the theory of the distracted housewife. They simply seized her attention and changed the pattern of her life. After "Just Plain Bill" hit the daytime airwaves in 1933, housewives arranged their work so  they would never miss an episode of the small-town barber who married above himself.         Although a short-lived 1930 program, "Painted Lives" by Irna Phillips, is regarded as the first radio soap opera, it was "Just Plain Bill," which began at night in 1932, that created the cultural juggernaut that would eventually be  nicknamed for the product that often sponsored it.         Within months the show had spawned many copycats, few as successful as those  turned out by the Hummerts themselves, who had as many as 18 separate 15-minute  serials running at a time for a total of 90 episodes a week, each ending with an unresolved crisis that was heightened for the Friday episode.         The couple, who formed their own company, Hummert Productions, and moved to New York in the mid-1930's, farmed out the writing after they had dreamed up the original idea and mapped out the initial story line. But they were deeply involved in every aspect of each production, from casting to script editing.         Mrs. Hummert, who had a photographic memory, was renowned in the industry for her ability to remember each intricate twist of every one of their creations.         It was a reflection of the grip the Hummerts had on their audience that their programs generated more than five million letters a year, and it was a measure of their commercial success that by 1939 Hummert programs accounted for more than half the advertising revenues generated by daytime radio.         The Hummerts were also well rewarded. At a time when the average doctor made  less than $5,000 a year and the average lawyer half that, they were each making  $100,000 a year from their enterprise, which included several evening musical programs, like "Waltz Time," and mysteries, including the haunting "Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons."         When television began to displace radio, the couple simply retired and enjoyed a well-traveled life of leisure. After her husband's death, Mrs. Hummert gave up their Park Avenue triplex and cut down a bit on her travels, but she continued her active life, which until a few months ago included daily three-mile walks.         Mrs. Hummert, whose son died several years ago, is survived by two granddaughters, Pamela Pigoni of Hinckley, Ill., and Anne Jeskey of Park Ridge,  Ill., and two great-grandchildren.       
         Harriett Heywood Patton, a founder of Recording for the Blind and a managing  director of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, died on Wednesday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville. She was 85 and lived in Bronxville.         She suffered a brief illness, her husband, Arch Patton, said.         Mrs. Patton is credited with contributing significantly to the growth of Recording for the Blind, which she served as president in 1954, and of the Opera Guild. She was managing director of the guild from 1959 to 1968.         She was born in Indianapolis and graduated from Wheelock College in Boston. During and after World War II, she worked for United China Relief and the Friends of France and played a pivotal role on the Committee for Economic Development, a national organization.         The committee brought together top corporate executives to plan for the postwar era; Mrs. Patton was recruited as deputy director.         Acting as a welcoming party of one, she kept track of the members' comings and goings and saw to it that they were fed, chauffeured and otherwise cared for.         In 1948, she was a founder of Recording for the Blind, and she helped build it from a local group in New York for the benefit of blind war veterans into a national organization. She crusaded across the country to get concerned people to band together in local chapters and open recording studios for volunteers to  do the readings.         Eleanor R. Belmont, founder of the Opera Guild and a friend, persuaded Mrs. Patton to turn her attention in that direction and become managing director. During her tenure of nearly 10 years, the guild's membership and donations quickly increased, both in the United States and abroad.         Mrs. Patton, who had served as a director, was familiar with the operation and earned a reputation for running a trim ship. Annual gifts to the guild, $90,000 in Mrs. Patton's first year as chief executive, rose nearly fourfold, to $355,000.         She grew up in Portland, Me., and acted in summer stock for three years as a  young woman.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Patton left no immediate family. An earlier marriage to Roswell L. Gilpatric ended in divorce.       
         Katharine Huyck Elmore, the chairwoman of the Edmund Niles Huyck Preserve and Biological Research Station in Rensselaerville, N.Y., died Monday at the Meadow  Lakes retirement community in Hightstown, N.J. She was 92 and formerly lived in  Rensselaerville.         She was also a co-founder and honorary trustee of the Rensselaerville Institute, which organizes conferences, research and demonstration projects dealing with topics like environmental impact, land use and community renewal. Her family donated summer homes and other properties used by the institute.         She joined the board of the preserve, named for her uncle, when it was founded in 1931 and became its chairwoman in 1973. Its approximately 2,000 acres are used for research, education and recreation.         Her husband, Probien Lee Elmore, and her daughter, Ann Stephenson, died in 1985; her son, James Elmore, died in 1993. She is survived by 10 grandchildren,  16 great-grandchildren and 4 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Gertrude Crain, who was chairwoman of the Crain Communications publishing company for more than 20 years, died July 20 at her son's summer home on Cape Cod. She was 85 years old and lived in Chicago.         In all, Mrs. Crain spent 40 years with the Chicago-based company that her husband, G. D. Crain Jr., founded in 1916. The company publishes 27 trade, business and consumer newspapers, including Advertising Age, Crain's New York Business, Automotive News and Electronic Media, and owns a radio station in the  Florida Keys.         Mrs. Crain became chairwoman in 1974, succeeding her husband, who died in 1973. Before then, she had been secretary and assistant treasurer. She retired in May and became chairman emeritus.         In 1993, Mrs. Crain was awarded the Henry Johnson Fisher Award for lifetime achievement from the Magazine Publishers of America. Previous recipients have included Henry Luce, S. I. Newhouse Jr., Malcolm Forbes, John Mack Carter and Helen Gurley Brown.         Upon receiving the award at the Waldorf Astoria, Mrs. Crain said it rightly belonged to her husband, who started Crain Communications "with little more than a few hundred dollars and a dream."         Mrs. Crain, who served on the boards of the International Advertising Association, the National Press Foundation and the Advertising Council of New York, was an early critic of violence in television shows. In speeches to several advertising and communications organizations, she advocated voluntary restraint.         In 1982, Mrs. Crain became a founding member of the Committee of 200, an organization consisting of the top 200 women business owners and chief executives in the country.         Mrs. Crain is survived by her two sons, Keith of Grosse Pointe, Mich., and Rance of New York City; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Theo Cobb Landon, the widow of Gov. Alfred M. Landon of Kansas and the mother of Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, died on Sunday at her home in Topeka. She was 97.         Mr. Landon, the Republican candidate for President in 1936, died in 1987 at the age of 100 after 57 years of marriage.         Six decades ago, Mrs. Landon drew press coverage around the country by refusing to join her husband on the hustings in his quest to unseat President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mrs. Landon insisted that she could not campaign and also guard the privacy of her family. She had two young children to look after and, she told the press, she was needed at home.         Besides Senator Kassebaum, Mrs. Landon is survived by a son, John C.; six grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Jessica Mitford, whose book "The American Way of Death" won her enormous popularity as an irreverent muckraker and witty polemicist, died yesterday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Constancia Romilly.         Over the more than three decades that she wrote nonfiction, Miss Mitford railed against those who tried to suppress dissent over the Vietnam War, against a prison system she found to be corrupt and brutalizing, and against a medical profession she thought was greedy and given to unnecessary procedures. She even  exposed the odd doings of her sisters.         But it was "The American Way of Death," published in 1963, that made the British-born Miss Mitford a formidable literary figure in her adopted country. Near her death she was preparing a revision to be published next year by Alfred  A. Knopf.         The thesis of the book, a scathing indictment of the American funeral industry, was that undertakers had "successfully turned the tables in recent years to perpetrate a huge, macabre and expensive practical joke on the American public."         She explored the changing lexicon of death, in which undertakers had come to  call themselves "funeral directors" and "morticians," coffins had become "caskets," and hearses had become "professional cars." In the new order, she said, flowers were "floral tributes" and corpses were always called "loved ones." One of the results of all this, she said, was that the cost of dying was  rising faster than was the cost of living.         She told her readers unsettling things about their neighborhood undertakers,  much to the dismay of the trade, and at the end of the book included a list of medical schools that might have good use for a dead body. She felt strongly that someone's mortal remains would be better off studied by medical students than transformed into a profit center for those in the business of marketing and planning funerals.         The New Yorker hailed the book as a "brilliant journalistic case against the  whole funeral industry," and the work led to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. But not everyone was pleased. James B. Utt, then a Republican  Congressman from California, a state known for its Pharaonic funerals and ornate cemeteries, denounced Miss Mitford as "pro-Communist, anti-American." Mr. Utt said he suspected that profits from the book "no doubt will find their way into  the coffers of the Communist Party, U.S.A." Miss Mitford had been a Communist in the 1940's, an experience chronicled in her memoirs, but had quit the party.         Jessica Mitford was born on Sept. 11, 1917, at Batsford Mansion in Gloucestershire, England, one of seven children and the youngest daughter born to Lord Redesdale (David Mitford) and Lady Redesdale, the former Sydney Bowles.         It was by any measure a family given to eccentricity. One of Miss Mitford's five sisters, Pamela, aspired as a child to be a horse. Another, Diana, wanted to be a Fascist and succeeded in becoming the wife of Sir Oswald Mosley, the ranking leader of Britain's Fascists. Another daughter, Unity, went to Germany,  became a disciple of Hitler, shot herself and died nine years later in a nursing home.         Miss Mitford's eldest sister, Nancy, became a novelist, and is best remembered for "The Pursuit of Love" and "Love in a Cold Climate."         Miss Mitford described her childhood as largely unhappy. She particularly resented that she and her sisters were prevented from going to school because Lady Redesdale did not believe that girls needed it and tutored them at home.         Early in life, Miss Mitford shared a sitting room with her sister Unity, who  adorned it with swastikas. According to her memoirs, Miss Mitford responded by using a diamond ring to carve small hammers and sickles into the windowpanes on her side of the room.         When she was 19, she ran away from home with a second cousin, Esmond Romilly, a nephew of Winston Churchill. Because she eloped, she was cut out of her father's will. In 1939, Miss Mitford quit her job as a market researcher in the  London office of J. Walter Thompson and moved to the United States with her husband. He joined the Canadian Air Force after the war broke out and was killed in action in 1941.         Miss Mitford was a union organizer, a bartender at a Miami restaurant, a clerk in a Washington dress shop and a typist and later an investigator at the Office of Price Administration in World War II.         In 1943, she married Robert E. Treuhaft, a lawyer from Brooklyn, and the couple moved to Oakland, Calif. When Miss Mitford was 38, she decided that she would become a writer. She had largely failed at her other jobs, she wrote, and  "I figured that the only thing that requires no education and no skills is writing."         She produced her first book, "Life itselfmanship," in 1956. It was privately  published and had little circulation. Her second effort, "Daughters and Rebels," an autobiography, was published in 1960 and won praise from the critics. Her next book was "The American Way of Death," which remained on the best-seller list for a year.         Late in life, she was asked what sort of funeral she wanted. An elaborate one, she replied, with "six black horses with plumes and one of those marvelous  jobs of embalming that take 20 years off." She added that she wanted "streets to be blocked off, dignitaries to declaim sobbingly over the flower-smothered bier, proclamations to be issued -- that sort of thing."         Her other books attracted much attention, although none as much as "The American Way of Death." She also wrote "The Trial of Dr. Spock, William Sloan Coffin Jr., Michael Ferber, Mitchell Goodman and Marcus Raskin" (1969), five who were accused of aiding and abetting those who sought to violate the Selective Service Act. Among her other books were "Kind and Unusual Punishment: The Prison Business" (1973), a study of American prisons, which she found wanting in almost everything except brutality; "A Fine Old Conflict" (1977), a memoir of her Communist days; "Poison Penmanship: The Gentle Art of Muckraking" (1979), and "The American Way of Birth" (1992), in which she accused doctors of doing too many Caesarean sections and of not paying enough attention to the possibilities  offered by midwifery.         She also wrote articles for Life, Esquire, The Nation and The San Francisco Chronicle.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband; a  son, Benjamin Treuhaft of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Deborah Devonshire of Chatsworth, England, and Diana Mosley of Paris, and three grandchildren.         Correction:         An obituary of the writer Jessica Mitford on Wednesday omitted the titles of  her surviving sisters and misidentified the hometown of one. One sister is Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire. Her hometown is Bakewell, in Darbyshire; Chatsworth is the name of her house. The other sister is Lady Diana Mosley.         An obituary on July 24 about the writer Jessica Mitford misstated the relative ages of her and her sisters. Ms. Mitford was the second youngest of six daughters. Her sister Deborah was the youngest.       
         Josephine Rucker Powell, the wife of former Supreme Court Justice Lewis F. Powell, died on Wednesday at her home in Richmond. She was 85.         The cause was non-Hodgkins lymphoma, the family said.         Mrs. Powell was a member of the board of the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities. She was also a member of several civic and social organizations in Richmond and Washington.         She was a graduate of Sweet Briar College.         In addition to her husband, whom she married in 1936 and who retired from the Supreme Court in 1986, Mrs. Powell is survived by three daughters, Pendleton Bowen of Whidbey Island, Wash., Josephine Smith of Houston and Molly Sumner of Salt Lake City; a son, Lewis F. 3d, of Richmond, and eight grandchildren.       
         Geraldine Bone Zorbaugh, a lawyer who was a trailblazer for women in the upper ranks of broadcast networks' legal staffs in the 1950's, died on Saturday  at Moore Regional Hospital in Pinehurst, N.C. She was 91 and lived in a retirement home in Pinehurst.         Mrs. Zorbaugh worked as a secretary in her hometown, Barnesboro, in central Pennsylvania, and later in New York City, where she met her husband, had two children, graduated from law school and became prominent as a network lawyer, first at ABC.         When she was promoted to acting general counsel at ABC in 1951, Fortune magazine said she was the first woman to achieve high rank in her field. She became general counsel and a vice president, both firsts for a woman, in 1956.         Mrs. Zorbaugh moved from ABC to CBS in 1957, becoming general attorney for radio as well as a vice president. She retired in 1968.         "She was a pioneer for women in management in broadcasting, and she used her  position to help other women" Eleanor R. Applewhaite, vice president and general counsel of Thirteen/WNET, the public television station, said yesterday.         Ms. Applewhaite, who is black and was hired by Mrs. Zorbaugh in 1964 for the  radio section of CBS's law department, said: "When she hired me, I don't think there was another black attorney at any of the networks. She had a very caring attitude for the people who worked for her."         After graduating from high school in Barnesboro and working there, Mrs. Zorbaugh came to New York. She studied at the Washington Square College of New York University while being paid for grading papers and exams at the education school at New York University.         In 1929, she married Harvey W. Zorbaugh, a university faculty member who became chairman of the department of educational sociology. She dropped out of college for two years -- during which her son, Harvey, was born -- and then returned and received her bachelor's degree in 1932.         After college she worked as a secretary in the radio industry, at the Blue Network, and, as Ms. Applewhaite said, "after observing what the lawyers were doing, she went to law school," in 1938.         Mrs. Zorbaugh went on to work as a lawyer with a New York law firm and with the Blue Network before joining ABC in 1944.         Professor Zorbaugh died in 1965.         In addition to her son, of Columbia, Md., and her daughter, Anne Allen of East Windsor, N.J., she is survived by three grandchildren.       
         Anne W. Simon, an environmentalist whose books explored the perils to the world's seas and shorelines, particularly on her beloved Martha's Vineyard, died on Monday at her Manhattan home. She was 82 and also had a home in Chilmark, Mass.         At her death she was working on a book on the changing nature of Martha's Vineyard and what might be done to save the island where she had summered for many years. An article based on its first chapter was published in the July issue of the monthly Martha's Vineyard Magazine.         The article echoed her earlier book, "No Island Is an Island: The Ordeal of  Martha's Vineyard" (1973). There she told the tale of how the Vineyard, after hundreds of years of slumber, surrendered to tract subdivisions, an explosion of second homes, sewage spillovers and traffic jams.         Another volume, "The Thin Edge: Coast and Man in Crisis" (1978), discussed the precarious state of dunes and beaches, wetlands and estuaries everywhere that economic development reaches them. "Neptune's Revenge: The Ocean of Tomorrow" (1984) was an unsparing critique of the environmental damage to oceans from oil spills, overfishing, the greenhouse effect and the dumping of sewage, toxins and radioactive waste.         Anne Wertheim was born in Cos Cob, Conn., and in 1935 graduated from Smith College, where she edited the campus newspaper. She earned a master's degree at  the School of Social Work of Columbia University.         She was a writer at radio station WNYC, became a television critic for The Nation and subsequently wrote for McCall's, Good Housekeeping and other periodicals. Her first book was "Stepchild in the Family: A View of Children in  Remarriage" (1964), a primer based on her own experience as a stepchild and as a stepparent.         She was married three times and had taken the surname of her last husband, Prof. Walter Werner, while keeping her pen name. He died in 1986. Her previous marriages, to Dr. Louis Langman and Robert Simon, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son and three daughters from her first marriage: Thomas  Langman of Washington, Betsy L. Schulberg of Westhampton Beach, L.I., Lynn L. Lilienthal of Reston, Va., and Deborah L. Lesser of Berkeley, Calif., and 11 grandchildren.       
         The badly decomposed body of the actress and model Margaux Hemingway, who was once described as the face of a generation, was discovered by friends yesterday  in her home in Santa Monica, Calif., the police said.         Santa Monica police investigators arrived at Ms. Hemingway's studio apartment at 1:52 P.M. after the body's discovery, said Sgt. Gary Gallinot, a department spokesman.         Ms. Hemingway, 41, a granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway, had not been seen since Friday and friends were concerned, the sergeant said. He said there were no signs of forced entry or foul play.         The friends, whose names were not released by the police, grew worried when Ms. Hemingway did not respond to knocks on the door. They asked a laborer working in the neighborhood to get a ladder so they could enter the home through a balcony, Sergeant Gallinot said.         Officials of the Los Angeles coroner's office said the body was so decomposed that immediate identification was difficult and the police initially would only  confirm the body was that of a woman. The cause of death will be determined through an autopsy. Identity was made through dental records.         Ms. Hemingway had recently moved into a studio apartment on quiet, leafy street near the beach.         Her agent, David Mirisch, told CNN that she had recently finished a Westinghouse television series narrating an animal show, called "The Wild Guide."         She had struggled publicly with alcoholism and bulimia and was treated at the Betty Ford Center in 1988. She made her screen debut in the "Lipstick" in 1976,  opposite her younger sister, Mariel. The film, which got negative reviews, was about a young model who was raped then humiliated when a jury acquitted the defendant.         The lucrative movie contract was preceded by a successful modeling career, which began with the urging of a former husband, Errol Wetson, the former owner  and co-founder of Wetson hamburgers, a fast-food restaurant chain.         Joe Eula, the New York fashion artist, said in 1975 that Ms. Hemingway had "the face of a generation, as recognizable and memorable as Lisa Fonssagrives and Jean Shrimpton."         Later that year, she would garner what New Yorker magazine called, "the largest single advertising contract ever involving a female personality," when she signed a $1 million contract to become spokeswoman for Babe, a fragrance line developed by Faberge.         Born in Portland, Oregon in 1955, Ms. Hemingway, was the second of the three  daughters of John and Byra Hemingway. She was said to have changed her name from Margot when she learned that her parents drank a bottle of Chateau Margaux on the night of her conception.         The family spent several years on Ernest Hemingway's farm in Cuba. They then  moved to San Francisco, where her father worked as a stockbroker. In 1967, the family moved once again to mountainous Ketchum, Idaho, where Ernest Hemingway committed suicide six years earlier.       
         The badly decomposed body of the actress and model Margaux Hemingway, who was once described as the face of a generation, was discovered by friends on Monday  in her home in Santa Monica, Calif., the police said.

Ms. Hemingway, a granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway, had not been seen since Friday, and friends were concerned, the sergeant said. He said there were no signs of forced entry or foul play.         A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office, Fred Corral, said yesterday that autopsy results would not be available for about two weeks but that a preliminary investigation pointed to death by "apparent natural causes,"  possibly linked to Ms. Hemingway's history of epilepsy. Ms. Hemingway had also struggled publicly with alcoholism and bulimia.         When Ms. Hemingway did not respond to phone calls or knocks on the door, friends asked a laborer working in the neighborhood to get a ladder so they could enter the home through a balcony, Sergeant Gallinot said. Ms. Hemingway had recently moved into the studio apartment near the beach.         Her agent, David Mirisch, told CNN that she had recently finished narrating a series on animals.         Tall, blond and glamorous, Ms. Hemingway achieved nearly instant renown in the 1970's as a supermodel. She began her career at the urging of a former husband, Errol Wetson, a film producer and a founder and former owner of the Wetson hamburger chain.         Joe Eula, the New York fashion artist, said in 1975 that Ms. Hemingway had "the face of a generation, as recognizable and memorable as Lisa Fonssagrives and Jean Shrimpton."         Later that year, she signed what The New Yorker called "the largest single advertising contract ever involving a female personality." The $1 million contract made her the spokeswoman for Babe, a fragrance line developed by Faberge.         She made her screen debut in "Lipstick" in 1976, opposite her younger sister, Mariel. The film, which received negative reviews, was about a young model who seeks vengeance after she is raped, then humiliated when a jury acquits the defendant. Ms. Hemingway's acting career faltered, while her sister fared better, appearing in films like Woody Allen's "Manhattan."         Ms. Hemingway was born in Portland, Ore., in 1955, the second of the three daughters of John Hadley and Byra Whitlock Hemingway. She was said to have changed her name from Margot when she learned that her parents drank Chateau Margaux on the night of her conception.         The family spent several years on Ernest Hemingway's farm in Cuba. They then  moved to San Francisco, where her father was a stockbroker. In 1967, the family  moved to mountainous Ketchum, Idaho, where Ernest Hemingway had committed suicide six years earlier.         Ms. Hemingway's two marriages, first to Mr. Wetson, then to Bernardo Faucher, a French-born film maker, ended in divorce.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by her father and stepmother.       
         Andrea Ungar Wilson, a former investment analyst, school administrator and labor arbitrator, died on August 11 at her summer home in Wainscott, N.Y. She was 73 and a resident of Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         A native of Vienna, she graduated from Mount Holyoke in 1943, received a Master of Business Administration degree from New York University in 1946 and a doctorate in education in 1971.         Starting in 1944, she worked for 17 years at a number of investment consulting firms in New York. She then became an assistant to a member of the Board of Education and became involved with the decentralization plan that instituted the system of neighborhood school boards in the 1960's.         She was later appointed an assistant dean and associate professor of educational administration at New York University. At her death she worked as a labor arbitrator for the New York State Mediation Board.         Mrs. Wilson's husband, Fred W., died in 1994. She is survived by a son, David, of Wayne, N.J.; a daughter, Pamela, of Chicago; a sister, Marlene Bagdikian of Berkeley, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Nanette Bearden, the founder and artistic director of the Nanette Bearden Contemporary Dance Theater, died on Aug. 10 at St. Vincent's Medical Center on Staten Island. She was 69 and had homes in Manhattan and on St. Martin in the French West Indies.         The cause was a pulmonary embolism, said Dorothy Dow, a sister.         Ms. Bearden was an energetic supporter of fledgling black choreographers and small modern-dance companies and produced their work in a series, Broadway Dance Festival, in 1975 and 1976. Her own modern-dance company, founded in 1976 as the Chamber Dance Group, presented simple stage productions for dances by black choreographers who included Walter Rutledge, Gary DeLoatch, Walter Raines, William Scott and Roumel Reaux. The company also performed dances by such leading choreographers as Alvin Ailey, Talley Beatty, Fred Benjamin, George Faison and Dianne McIntyre.         Born on Staten Island, Ms. Bearden studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and was a model with the Ophelia DeVore Agency. She trained in dance at the Martha Graham school, at Clark Center and at the Luigi Dance Center and performed from 1971 to 1974 with the New World Dancers. She was also a promoter of visual arts in the French West Indies.         Ms. Bearden's husband, the artist Romare Bearden, died in 1988. Besides Mrs. Dow, she is survived by six other sisters, Evelyn Jackson and Marie, Sheila and Delores Rohan, all of Staten Island and St. Martin; Annette Rohan of Bellflower, Calif., and Gloria Elboushi of Long Beach, Calif.       
         Geulah Abrahams, a modern dancer and choreographer, died on Saturday at the Princeton Medical Center in Princeton, N.J. She was 65 and had homes in Princeton and New York.         She died after a brief illness, her husband, Elihu Abrahams, said.         Ms. Abrahams performed with the Paul Taylor Dance Company in 1963 and also danced with Mary Anthony, Pearl Lang and the Merry-Go-Rounders. She was on the dance faculty at Princeton University from 1975 to 1985. While there, she choreographed a production of Stravinsky's ''Soldier's Tale'' in collaboration with Michael Graves, the architect and designer, and Michael Pratt, the conductor.         She collaborated frequently with Paul Lansky, the composer, with whom she presented a retrospective program in New York and Princeton in 1995. She also choreographed for theater and opera with various directors, including Wilford Leach, Michael Kahn and Edward Berkeley.         Ms. Abrahams founded her own modern dance company, Geulah Abrahams Danceworks, in 1985. Interested in the connections between art and science, she created ''Dances in Physics'' in 1989 and presented the work at the California Museum of Science and Industry in Los Angeles. She also taught and choreographed at the Ballet West summer school in Aspen, Colo.         During the past three years, she taught at the Aspen Music Festival and was the resident choreographer of the Aspen Opera House.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Jonathan, of New York City and David, of Cambridge, Mass., and by a brother, Shmuel Govreen of Jerusalem.       
         Lillian Clark, a singer who performed with many stars of the big-band era and helped preserve the work of her husband, the composer and arranger Sy Oliver, died on Tuesday at her home in New York City. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, according to a statement from the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, of which she was national treasurer.         Ms. Clark, whose original name was Autilia Ventimiglia, was born in Scranton, Pa. She studied at the Juilliard School, intending to become a classical pianist. But when one of the Clark Sisters left that popular singing group in the 1940's, she auditioned, got the job and changed her name.         She met her future husband when the group was performing on Tommy Dorsey's radio show on WOR. After Mr. Oliver died in 1988, she catalogued his music, most of which she donated to New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and to the Smithsonian Institution.         Ms. Clark appeared on Perry Como's television show in the 1950's and recorded with Count Basie, Ella Fitzgerald, Tommy Dorsey and Louis Armstrong. She was also one of the original Ray Charles Singers and sang with other groups, including the Ray Conniff Singers and the Norman Luboff Choir.         She is survived by a son, Jeffry James Oliver of New York City, and a brother, Sal Ventimiglia.       
         Doris Rosenblum, an indefatigable combatant in 40 years of struggle over housing, education and development on Manhattan's Upper West Side, died of cancer yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71.         Ms. Rosenblum served for the last six years as the borough historian of Manhattan, and her positions of civic authority included her job as district manager of Community Board 7 on the Upper West Side from 1983 to 1990. But the impact of the woman who came to embody neighborhood advocacy in New York City extended far beyond that conferred by official titles.         Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said in an interview yesterday that ''she was and always will be remembered as the Mayor of the Upper West Side.''         Ms. Rosenblum was so deeply involved in the affairs of her neighborhood -- from the decentralization of authority over the public schools in the 1960's to the development battles of the 1980's -- that many people regarded her as an irreplaceable force.         ''She is as much a part of the West Side as the No. 2 train,'' Ronnie Eldridge, the City Council member, said when Ms. Rosenblum retired from Community Board 7 in 1990.         Born June 30, 1925, on Manhattan's Lower East Side, and raised in the South Bronx, she first engaged the political establishment of the Upper West Side when she moved there in 1959 with her husband, Paul, a printer for The New York Times and a scholar in African history.         Within months of her arrival, she began investigating conditions in her children's public school, joined and was elected president of the neighborhood branch of the United Parents Association and led a campaign for smaller schools under greater neighborhood control. That culminated in 1971 when she was part of the group that founded the first alternative high school on the Upper West Side, the West Side High School.         Ms. Rosenblum's most far-reaching impact may have been in her fight to maintain housing for low-income and middle-income people amid the massive urban renewal projects, including Mitchell-Lama apartments and public housing that  were built on the Upper West Side during the 1960's and 1970's.         ''She always wanted to make sure that urban renewal was not urban removal,'' her husband said. Ms. Rosenblum's base of influence included the Strycker's Bay Neighborhood Council, where she served as a board member and president, and later Community Board 7, where she became a member in 1971.         After 12 years as a board member, she was appointed district manager of the board in 1983, making her a central mediator, fact finder and advocate at a time when the Upper West Side was awash in huge development plans. Until 1990, when she resigned, she coordinated neighborhood opposition to several projects, including huge developments planned for the site of the New York Coliseum and Donald Trump's Riverside South property.         Ms. Rosenblum was appointed as the official historian of Manhattan -- a voluntary post -- by Ms. Messinger in 1990.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Rosenblum is survived by her mother, Fannie Koppelman of Manhattan; a daughter, Beth, of Ashland, Mass., and a brother, Frank, of Queens. Her son, Peter, was killed in an auto accident in 1981.       
         Sandra Isham Vreeland, a poet who was the director of an AIDS poetry project for young people, died yesterday at her home in Bridgehampton, L.I. She was 38 and also had a residence in Manhattan.         The cause was AIDS-related, her family said.         Working with the Poetry Society of America, she created her poetry project in 1994 to encourage young people to express their thoughts and feelings about H.I.V. infection through poetry. She had begun to write verse at a young age and published a collection of her poems as ''The Sky Lotto'' last year (Canio's Editions).         She was born in Washington, the daughter of Heyward Isham, a former United States ambassador to Haiti, and Sheila Isham, a painter. After graduating from Phillips Academy in Andover, Mass., where she directed plays, she lived and studied in Hong Kong, Paris and Haiti.         In addition to her parents, residents of Manhattan and Sagaponack, L.I., Mrs. Vreeland is survived by her husband, Alexander Vreeland; her children, Reed and Victoria, and her brothers, Christopher E. and Ralph H. Isham, both of Manhattan.       
         Helen Kushnick, who managed Jay Leno's rise from small-time comic to star of the ''Tonight'' show but was dismissed as the program's executive producer four months after Mr. Leno succeeded Johnny Carson as host, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said Jane Rosenthal, a friend. She was 51.         After Mr. Leno took over ''Tonight'' in May 1992, the show received an avalanche of criticism and ratings began to fall. In late September, NBC executives dismissed Ms. Kushnick after she was accused of demanding that guests booked by ''Tonight'' not appear on rival talk shows.         Ms. Kushnick, whose maiden name was Gorman, grew up in Harlem. Her first job was as secretary to the producer David Gerber at 20th Century Fox in New York. She moved to Hollywood with Mr. Gerber and eventually found work at International Creative Management, the talent agency, where she rose from secretary to agent.         In the mid-1970's, she formed a partnership with her husband, Jerrold Kushnick, an entertainment lawyer, and established herself as a manager. Her clients included Mr. Leno, whom she spotted in 1975 at the Comedy Store, Elayne Boosler, Jimmie Walker and for a brief period David Letterman.         Ms. Kushnick's role in Mr. Leno's rise to host of ''The Tonight Show'' was chronicled in ''The Late Shift: Letterman, Leno and the Network Battle for the Night,'' by Bill Carter, a television reporter for The New York Times. In an HBO movie based on the book, the role of Ms. Kushnick was played by Kathy Bates.         Ms. Kushnick, contesting Mr. Carter's version of events, filed a lawsuit for libel, which was settled out of court.         Mr. Kushnick died of cancer seven years ago. The couple had twins, one of whom, Samuel, became infected with the virus that causes AIDS during a blood transfusion and died at age 3 in 1983. Ms. Kushnick became a campaigner in the fight against the disease.         Ms. Kushnick is survived by a daughter, Sara Rose (the other twin), and a brother, Joseph Gorman, of New York City.       
         Loret Miller Ruppe, who was head of the Peace Corps longer than anyone else in the organization's 35-year history and was credited by many with restoring much of its Kennedy-era vitality, died yesterday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 60.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Ruppe was appointed director of the Peace Corps by President Ronald Reagan in 1981. She served for eight years, after which she was appointed Ambassador to Norway by President George Bush. She held that post until 1993.         When Mrs. Ruppe took over the Peace Corps, it was very much in need of revitalization. Its volunteer force had shrunk from a high of more than 15,000 in 1966 to about 5,000, and its budget had been cut.         The agency had had seven directors in the previous decade, and it had lost much of its independence after President Richard M. Nixon folded it into an umbrella agency called Action in an effort to downgrade some programs inherited from his Democratic predecessors.         In 1982, Congress restored the corps' independence. Mrs. Ruppe tried new approaches to bolster the volunteer ranks. She decided that the youthful idealism of, say, a 22-year-old English major might be nicely balanced by the experience and special skills of, say, an agricultural scientist in his mid-50's who did spot-welding in his spare time.         She pressed the search for volunteers with specific skills -- tending forests, stocking fish ponds, setting up sanitation systems -- and encouraged special arrangements with colleges and universities. Some colleges offered financial concessions to students with heavy debts if they joined the Peace Corps; others offered programs combining work on master's degrees with service in the corps.         On Jan. 10, 1985, Mrs. Ruppe went on national television to say that the Peace Corps was looking for 600 volunteers to do famine-relief work in Africa. Within a few days, more than 7,000 people contacted the agency.         Under Mrs. Ruppe, the Peace Corps developed short-term programs, enabling teachers, doctors and farmers to do volunteer work overseas while on sabbaticals or even long vacations. When Mrs. Ruppe became director, 3 percent of the volunteer were over age 50; six years later, 11 percent were.         During her tenure, Mrs. Ruppe (pronounced ROO-pee) visited volunteers in more than 60 countries in Asia, Africa, Latin America and the Pacific where the Peace Corps was involved. The agency started new programs or restarted dormant ones in Sri Lanka, Haiti, Burundi, Guinea-Bissau, Chad, Equatorial Guinea and Cape Verde.         Mrs. Ruppe drew praise from R. Sargent Shriver, the Democrat and Kennedy in-law who was the Peace Corps' first director.         ''She's the kind of Republican we tried to recruit into management when we first started out,'' Mr. Shriver said in 1982.         Mrs. Ruppe had impeccable Republican credentials. Her husband, Philip, was a Republican Congressman from Michigan from 1967 to 1979. Mrs. Ruppe was Mr. Bush's campaign manager in the 1980 Michigan Presidential primary and was a leader of the Reagan-Bush campaign in Michigan that fall.         Mrs. Ruppe was born in Milwaukee. Her great-grandfather, Frederick Miller, founded the Miller Brewing Company. Her father, Frederick C. Miller, who had been captain of Notre Dame's 1928 football team, was the company chairman. He and a son, Frederick Jr., were killed in a plane crash in 1954.         Mrs. Ruppe attended Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., and Marquette University in Milwaukee.         Surviving are her husband, whom she married in 1957; five daughters, Antoinette Greenberg, of Chicago; Adele, of Mexico City; Loret Jr., a former Peace Corps volunteer, of Davis, Calif.; Katherine, of Manhattan, and Mary, of Bethesda; five sisters, Clair Krause and Gail Wray, both of Mequon, Wis.; Kate, of Springfield, Ill.; Carlotta Johnson, of Britain, and Adele, of Brunswick, Me.; a brother, Carl Miller, of Miami, and three grandchildren.       
         Helen Wilson Nies, a former Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, died on Wednesday, her 71st birthday, at Beebe Hospital in Lewes, Del. She lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was head injuries suffered in a bicycling accident a week earlier in Henlopen Acres, Del., the court said.         President Jimmy Carter named Judge Nies to the United States Customs and Patent Appeals Court in 1980, and President Ronald Reagan reassigned her to the Federal Circuit when that jurisdiction was established in October 1982. She became Chief Judge in June 1990, and served in that post until March 1994. She took senior status last November.         Judge Nies, a native of Birmingham, Ala., graduated from the University of Michigan in 1945 and, three years later, from Michigan Law School. She was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1948 but moved to Washington that year to work at the Justice Department.         She later was a counsel in the Office of Price Stabilization, but took eight years off in the 1950's to rear a family. Before her court appointment, she was a partner in Chicago and Washington law firms.         She is survived by her husband of 46 years, John Dirk Nies; two sons, J. Dirk, of Rockville, Md., and Eric W., of New York City; a daughter, Nancy N. Sloan of Las Vegas, Nev.; her mother, Lida Wilson of Rockville; a brother, George E. Wilson, and two grandchildren.       
         Louisa James Calder, widow of the sculptor Alexander Calder, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Mrs. Calder, born in 1905 in Seattle, was a great-niece of Henry, William and Alice James. She met her future husband during a trans-Atlantic voyage. The couple married in 1931 and moved to Paris.         Mrs. Calder executed a series of hooked rugs, based on her husband's designs, and wrote a book on crochet.         She received the United Nations Woman of the Year Award in 1975.         In 1977, two months after her husband's death, she declined to attend White House ceremonies honoring him to press for blanket amnesty for opponents of the Vietnam War.         She is survived by two daughters, Sandra Davidson of France and New York, and Mary Rower of New York and Connecticut; four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Greig, one of the country's most accomplished women at tying fly-fishing lures who was known for her adeptness and her unusual technique, died last Saturday at Highlands Lake Center-Genesis Eldercare in Lakeland, Fla. She was 93.         An expert known for tying flies with her hands instead of with a conventional vise, Mrs. Greig was a innovator in fly-fishing at a time when mostly men participated in the sport. In the late 1930's, Mrs. Greig was a founder of Angler's Roost, a popular fly-fishing shop situated in the Chrysler Building in New York City.         Her skills were pervasive, from knowing where to wade into the fly-fishing streams of the Catskills, to the important task of choosing the feathers and other materials that made the difference between a quality or inferior fly. Scotty, as she was called, encouraged the fish tales that floated in and out of the conversations at her shop in New York. ''There were more fish caught in my shop than on most streams,'' she was once quoted as having said.         Mrs. Greig was born in Peebles, Scotland, on Sept. 10, 1902. Her father, a stone mason, taught her how to fly-fish on the shores of the River Tweed by day, and how to tie flies at the kitchen table by night.         The family eventually moved to Edinburgh, where Mrs. Greig, then 14 years old, spent four years as an apprentice at a fly-dressing factory. After marrying Robert Greig of Scotland in the early 1930's, she and her husband immigrated to Canada, where they lived for several years before moving to New York City. In the mid-1950's, they moved on to Lakeland, Fla., where Mrs. Greig continued to specialize in making fishing lures. Her husband died in 1968.         Mrs. Greig is survived by three sisters, Annie, Nan and Jean, who live in Scotland.       
         Julia Morton, a self-taught expert on the uses of medicinal and toxic plants and a ''Dear Abby'' for Floridians concerned about poisonous greenery, died on Tuesday at Jackson Memorial Hospital in Miami. She was 84 and lived in Homestead, Fla.         Mrs. Morton had been critically injured in an automobile accident on Aug. 28, said officials at the University of Miami, where she was a professor for about four decades until retiring in 1993.         To her colleagues in the field of economic botany, the study of how people use plants, Mrs. Morton was an academic's academic, a founder and developer of the Morton Collectanea, an invaluable compilation of information about plants, and the author of 10 books on the subject.         But to the people of South Florida -- backyard gardeners, telephone line workers and ranchers, for example -- she offered practical advice, practically every day, on plants that can harm humans or animals. Through letters and phone calls, lectures and even posters that she designed for hospital emergency rooms, she worked to educate the public.         ''She was the poison plant center'' in South Florida, said Lawrence Kaplan, an emeritus professor of botany at the University of Massachusetts at Boston and editor of the journal of the Society of Economic Botany, which Mrs. Morton helped found. Anyone who suspected contact with plants that might be dangerous could, and did, contact her.         Her plant expertise extended far beyond the toxic variety. Several of her books are considered standard references in the field, including ''The Atlas of Medicinal Plants of Middle America'' (C.C. Thomas, 1981). She also had extensive knowledge of tropical fruits, which she also shared with anyone who asked.         ''She used to get mail by the pound from people all over the world,'' said Dr. Robert Kelley, associate chairman of the department of mathematics and computer science at the University of Miami, who knew Mrs. Morton for more than 20 years.         The letters would inquire about a particular plant, and Mrs. Morton would respond after doing the necessary research in her vast collection of reports, books and newspaper clippings or, often, just pulling the information out of her memory.         Mrs. Morton, who was reared in Vermont, never got a college degree. She started the Morton Collectanea with her husband, Kendal, in 1933 from an office near the New York Public Library.         The couple lived in the Bahamas during World War II, and their studies of the plant life there resulted in their first book, ''50 Tropical Fruits of Nassau'' (1949). The work attracted the attention of the president of the University of Miami, Bowman Foster Ashe, who offered them jobs as professors. Mr. Morton, a trained scientist, died in 1964.         Dr. John Beutler, a researcher at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., said that unlike many botanists who only dabble in the study of how plants are used, Mrs. Morton devoted all of her time to the field.         Dr. Beutler said he first encountered Mrs. Morton about two decades ago, when she sent him a plant that she thought might have some applications to cancer treatment. ''She was always on the lookout for obscure plants that might serve a useful purpose,'' he said.         Mrs. Morton is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         The actress and film director Christine Pascal, who made her movie acting debut at 21 and directed her first film at 25, has died at the age of 42, her husband's production agency said yesterday in Paris.         The agency, Armedia, founded by Ms. Pascal's husband, Richard Boner, did not give the cause of her death, which it said occurred late on Friday or early Saturday. The newspaper Le Monde said it was suicide.         Ms. Pascal began her film career in 1973 with a role in ''The Clockmaker,'' a well-received movie directed by Bertrand Tavernier and starring Philippe Noiret. Mr. Tavernier also directed her in four other movies, including ''Round Midnight'' (1985), a homage to bebop set in 50's Paris,  and ''Spoiled Children'' (1977), about a blocked writer-director who becomes involved with a younger woman.         She had roles in ''Black Thursday'' (1975), a film by Michel Mitrani about the roundup of Jews in Paris during the German occupation, and ''The Grand Highway'' (1987), the story of a 9-year-old boy who spends three weeks in a rural village.         In 1992 she won the Louis Delluc Prize for directing ''Le Petit Prince a Dit'' (''The Little Prince Said''). The most recent film she directed was ''Adultere: Mode d'Emploi'' (''Adultery: A User's Guide''),  which came out last year and was part of the Hamptons Film Festival.         ''I'm completely in shock, I can't believe it,'' Mr. Tavernier told the radio station RTL. ''She was someone who doubted herself, who experienced depression, whom you had to encourage constantly because she was afraid,'' he added. ''She was extraordinarily sensitive, and she showed it in the films she made as a director and as an actress.''       
         Elizabeth Bottomley Noyce, a microchip millionaire's scorned first wife who showed as much imagination and verve in deploying her half of his Silicon Valley fortune as he had in making it, died on Tuesday at her seaside home in Bremen, Me. She was 65 and had been the state's premier philanthropist and most innovative investor for two decades.         Her lawyer, Owen Wells, noting that Mrs. Noyce had long suffered from emphysema, said the cause was a heart attack.         The daughter of a blue-collar worker from Auburn, Mass., who had to hold two jobs to support his family in the Depression, Mrs. Noyce was majoring in English at Tufts University in the early 1950's and dreaming of becoming a writer when she signed on as costume director of a summer theatrical production and caught the eye of one of the cast members, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Robert N. Noyce.         The couple were married in 1953, and Mrs. Noyce, who had dreamed of writing novels and short stories, became the most dutiful of corporate wives, bearing four children and following her husband from job to job, including a somewhat reluctant move to California for a woman who never felt comfortable away from her beloved New England.         ''We were under the distinct impression that we would try it for a year and if I didn't like it we wouldn't stay,'' she recalled years later, suggesting that her husband had forgotten the bargain: ''We stayed 19 years.''         By then the life of the blue-collar worker's daughter had changed considerably, largely because her husband had become a co-inventor of the microchip, which laid the foundation for the vast personal computer industry, and had helped found three of the industry's premier companies, including the giant Intel Corporation.         Her life changed even more in 1975 when Mr. Noyce left her to marry an Intel executive. Although bitter over the circumstances of the breakup of her marriage, Mrs. Noyce, whose husband died in 1990, managed to console herself somewhat in the divorce. Under California's community property laws she claimed half his Intel stock and all his other assets, including full title to their 50-acre Maine estate, where Mrs. Noyce had been spending summers.         How much she received from the divorce could not be determined yesterday, and a spokesman for Intel, which has a market capitalization of $86 billion, could not say how much stock she owned at the time of her death. Mr. Wells, her lawyer, said, however, that after all her charitable donations, her estate was worth $100 million to $1 billion.         Putting her husband and California behind her, Mrs. Noyce did not so much move to Maine as adopt the state.         In a whirlwind of philanthropy that began almost as soon as she settled into her house on Muscongus Bay and continued the rest of her life, she systematically gave away some $75 million, primarily to Maine charities.         Oh, there would be the occasional out-of-state donation -- a million to Tufts here, a half-million to Harvard there -- but for the most part Mrs. Noyce, whose donations covered the gamut of public causes including education, medicine, the arts and the environment, concentrated her giving in Maine, responding to virtually any cause, charity or public institution in the state that needed money.         Among other things, she built a golf course for the town of Bremen, gave lavishly to the Portland Museum of Art, the Maine Maritime Museum and the University of Maine. When the Cumberland County Civic Center was so pressed for cash that it was looking for a corporate sponsor that would give it money in exchange for the right to give the center its name, Mrs. Noyce came through with a $1.3 million donation that allowed the center to retain its identity.         But for all the acclaim Mrs. Noyce received for her direct philanthropy, including the $15 million in endowments for charitable trusts that make independent grants to Maine charities, Mrs. Noyce gained even more applause when she began pioneering what she called ''catalytic philanthropy,'' investments designed to bolster the state's economy.         In 1991, for example, when out-of-state financial institutions were picking off Maine's banks one by one and it appeared that Maine businesses and other borrowers would soon be at the mercy of distant lenders, Mrs. Noyce blithely created a brand new bank, the Maine Bank and Trust Company with an initial $7.7 million investment that eventually grew to some $14 million.         What made such ''philanthropy,'' especially appealing became apparent when the bank prospered. Mr. Wells, who advised Mrs. Noyce on her investments, estimated yesterday that the bank was now worth at least twice what she paid for it.         During a lull in Maine's construction industry, Mrs. Noyce built five homes to provide jobs for construction workers, and when Maine's leading bakery was threatened with a takeover by a company that intended to move it out of state, Mrs. Noyce came to the rescue, buying the bakery and saving its 1,200 jobs.         Recently Mrs. Noyce had turned her attention to Portland's deteriorating downtown, going on a buying spree in which she acquired about 10 percent of the city's office and retail space. The rehabilitation effort attracted L. L. Bean and other tenants.         Although her efforts won wide praise, there were some rumblings that Mrs. Noyce was becoming too big a factor in the Portland economy and she had recently announced that she had no further designs on downtown property.         For all her wealth, Mrs. Noyce lived fairly simply, shunning the usual trappings of wealth and even driving her own car, most recently a Cadillac, to be sure, but only, she told her friends, because after a wreck in her smaller Oldsmobile, she felt more secure in a larger car.         Although she was always appropriately dressed, Mrs. Noyce had no interest in fashion and even less in travel, preferring to stay in Maine rather than visit the world's resorts.         Not that she was above the occasional indulgence. When she found that the steep driveway to her house became dangerously slick with wintertime ice, she built a more accessible winter home a thousand feet away.         Her only real material weakness stemmed from her love of the water, but it was a tribute to her reputation for innovative ''catalytic philanthropy,'' that when she indulged her passion by commissioning a multimillion-dollar 60-foot yacht a few years ago, the acquisition was not viewed in Maine as an example of conspicuous consumption. Instead the purchase was trumpeted in the Maine press as a rescue of Maine's boat-building industry.         In recent months Mrs. Noyce had apparently developed renewed concern about the state's beleaguered boat builders. She had commissioned a 90-foot yacht.         Mrs. Noyce is survived by a son, William, of Hollis, N.H.; three daughters, Pendred of Weston, Mass.; Priscilla, of Kenya and Margaret, of Montana; two brothers, Frank Bottomley of Ohio and Bruce, of New Hampshire; a sister, Frances Broomhead of Rhode Island, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Lamour, whose sarong-draped charms adorned many films of the late 1930's and 40's, especially the ''road'' pictures she made with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, died yesterday at her home in North Hollywood, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Lamour, a comely brunette who was also a favorite pinup of thousands of G.I.'s during World War II, was in her heyday at a time when the major studios believed that certain actresses needed something of a signature. Veronica Lake peered out from behind the lock of hair that invariably hid part of her face; Miss Lamour had her trademark sarong.  She wore that clinging garment in a series of films, from the 1936 ''Jungle Princess'' through such 1940's comedies as ''Road to Singapore'' and ''Road to Morocco.''         Miss Lamour appeared in seven of the road pictures, in which she was always the exotic but demure girl invariably won by a crooning Mr. Crosby at the expense of a more comedic Mr. Hope. On occasion, Miss Lamour would join Mr. Crosby in a ballad, such as ''Moonlight Becomes You'' or ''Constantly.'' By the late 1940's, her salary rose to a top of around $450,000 a movie.         But she had no illusions about either her acting or singing ability. Asked by an interviewer if she had ever studied acting or singing, she replied, ''No, can't you tell?''         During World War II, Miss Lamour was also known as ''the bond bombshell'' because of the volunteer work she did selling United States War Bonds. In tours around the country, she was credited with selling some $300 million of the bonds. So  effective was she as a saleswoman that the Government put a private railroad car at her disposal when she decided to go on a bond tour.         She received a belated citation for her bond work from the Treasury in 1965, at which time William H. Neal, at that time the director of the United States Savings Bond Division, credited her with being the first star to offer her services to sell war bonds and the originator of the successful Government plan for payroll deductions for those who wanted part of their salaries set aside for war bond purchases.         Her contributions to the war effort did not stop there. She was frequently seen at the Hollywood Canteen, the nightclub for servicemen founded by Bette Davis and John Garfield, where she spent many hours talking to and dancing with G.I.'s.         Miss Lamour was born on Dec. 10, 1914, in New Orleans as Mary Leta Dorothy Slaton, the daughter of John Watson Slaton and the former Carmen Louise La Porte. Her father was a waiter. Her mother, who soon divorced her father, worked as a waitress.         Young Dorothy never finished high school. The family finances were so desperate that when she was 15, she forged her mother's name to a document that authorized her to drop out of school.         Later, however, she did go to a secretarial school that did not require her to have a high school diploma. She regarded herself as an excellent typist and usually typed her own letters, even after she became quite wealthy.         After she won the 1931 Miss New Orleans beauty contest, she and her mother moved to Chicago, where  Miss Lamour earned $17 a week as an elevator operator for the Marshall Field department store on State Street. She had no training as a singer but was persuaded by a friend to try out for a female vocalist's spot with Herbie Kay, a band leader who  had a national radio show called ''The Yeast Foamers,'' apparently because it was sponsored by Fleischmann's Yeast.         She left Mr. Kay's group and moved to Manhattan, where Rudy Vallee, then a popular singer, helped her get a singing job at a popular night club, El Morocco. She later worked at 1 Fifth Avenue, a cabaret where she met Louis B. Mayer, the Hollywood studio chief. It was Mayer who eventually arranged for her to have a screen test, which led to her Paramount contract in 1935.         When she was at her zenith as a star, her fans suggested that an agent had adopted her last name from the French word for ''love'' as a box-office ploy. In fact, the name was close to one in the family; Miss Lamour adapted it herself from Lambour, which was the last name of her stepfather, Clarence, to whom her mother was briefly married.         Miss Lamour's more than 50 films included ''Typhoon'' (1939), ''Johnny Apollo'' (1940), ''The Fleet's In'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942), ''Duffy's Tavern'' (1945),  ''Here Comes the Groom'' (1951), ''Donovan's Reef'' (1962) and ''Pajama Party'' (1964).         The seven movies in which she appeared with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope were ''Road to Singapore (1940), ''Road to Zanzibar'' (1941), ''Road to Morocco'' (1942), ''Road to Utopia'' (1946), ''Road to Rio'' (1948) ''Road to Bali'' (1953) and ''Road to Hong Kong'' (1962). Although Miss Lamour worked closely with Mr. Hope and Crosby for many years, she said that she was not close to them personally.         Miss Lamour's first marriage, to Herbie Kay, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, William  Ross Howard 3d, in 1943 while she was on a bond tour. Mr. Howard, who had interests in the frozen food and advertising businesses, died in 1978.         After she retired from the movies, Miss Lamour remained active. In 1968, she starred in the national road show production of ''Hello, Dolly!'' And in 1969, she was named to the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore, where she then lived. She was active in various causes there for many years. In the 1980's, she worked the cabaret circuit, where she sang many of the songs she had sung in her movies.         In the 1987 film ''Creepshow 2,'' she played a sloppily dressed housewife who gets murdered. ''Well, at my age you can't lean against a palm tree and sing 'Moon of Monakoora,''' she said. ''People would look at that and say, 'What is she trying to do?' ''         While ''Creepshow 2'' was her only film role in two decades, she was frequently seen on television, doing guest shots such shows as ''The Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and, naturally, a few Bob Hope specials.         She is survived by her two sons, John Ridgley Howard and Tom Howard; a stepson, William Ross Howard 4th; a grandson, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  September 24, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Dorothy Lamour yesterday reversed parts of the name of her second husband in some copies. He was William Ross Howard 3d, not William Howard Ross 3d.

When she was at her zenith as a star, her fans suggested that an agent had adopted her last name from the French word for ''love'' as a box-office ploy. In fact, the name was close to one in the family; Miss Lamour adapted it herself from Lambour, which was the last name of her stepfather, Clarence, to whom her mother was briefly married.         Miss Lamour's more than 50 films included ''Typhoon'' (1939), ''Johnny Apollo'' (1940), ''The Fleet's In'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942), ''Duffy's Tavern'' (1945),  ''Here Comes the Groom'' (1951), and ''Donovan's Reef'' (1962).         The seven movies in which she appeared with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope were ''Road to Singapore (1940), ''Road to Zanzibar'' (1941), ''Road to Morocco'' (1942), ''Road to Utopia'' (1946), ''Road to Rio'' (1948) ''Road to Bali'' (1953) and ''Road to Hong Kong'' (1962). Although Miss Lamour worked closely with Mr. Hope and Mr. Crosby for many years, she said that she was not close to them personally.         Miss Lamour's first marriage, to Herbie Kay, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, William  Ross Howard 3d, in 1943 while she was on a bond tour.         After she retired from the movies, Miss Lamour remained active. In 1968, she starred in the national road show production of ''Hello, Dolly!'' And in 1969, she was named to the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore, where she then lived. She was active in various causes there for many years.         Her husband, Mr. Howard, who had interests in the frozen food and advertising businesses, died in 1978.  She is survived by her two sons from her second marriage, John Ridgley Howard and Tom Howard; a stepson, William Ross Howard 4th; a grandson, and a granddaughter.         In the 1980's, she worked the cabaret circuit, where she sang many of the songs she had sung in her movies.         In the 1987 film ''Creepshow 2,'' she played a sloppily dressed housewife who gets murdered. ''Well, at my age you can't lean against a palm tree and sing 'Moon of Monakoora,' '' she said. ''People would look at that and say, 'What is she trying to do?' ''         While ''Creepshow 2'' was her only film role in two decades, she was frequently seen on television, in guest shots on such shows as ''The Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and, naturally, a few Bob Hope specials.       
         Sabina Zlatin, who rescued dozens of Jewish children from the Nazis during World War II, died on Saturday in a Paris hospital. She was 89.         The Children's Home of Izieu, which she founded, helped more than 100 children elude capture by the occupying Germans before it became one of the more enduring and horrific symbols of Nazi barbarism.         One spring morning in 1944, the Gestapo raided the home and plucked 44 Jewish children from their breakfast and trucked them to their eventual deaths in concentration camps.         When Klaus Barbie, the wartime head of the German police in Lyons who ordered the raid on the home, went on trial in 1987, Mrs. Zlatin was among those who testified against him.         ''Her death makes even more necessary our duty to remember,'' said Lionel Jospin, the French Socialist Party leader.         Sabina Schwast was born to a Jewish family in Warsaw. She married a French agronomist named Miron Zlatin, settling with him on a farm in northern France and becoming a French citizen.         When war broke out in 1939, the Zlatins left their farm and she became a nurse at a military hospital in Montpellier. The job was short-lived. Once it was discovered that she was Jewish, the collaborationist government dismissed her. Soon after, she was drawn to the work of the Children's Rescue Charity, which assisted children endangered by the war.         In 1943, putting herself and her husband at grave risk, she decided to open a home to help these children. She chose as a refuge a farmhouse in Izieu, a quiet, tiny hilltop hamlet with a sweeping view of the Rhone River Valley and the snowy peaks of the Alps.         In that idyllic setting, she gave Jewish children of all ages sanctuary while she arranged to shuttle them out of France to safety in Switzerland. She managed to smuggle some 100 children from the Izieu home over the Swiss border and beyond the grasp of the Gestapo before the day the trucks came.         It was a neighboring farmer of German descent who betrayed the safe house. He had hired a teen-age boy from the children's home, somehow found out that the children were Jewish, then apparently passed the information to German troops garrisoned in a nearby town.         On April 6, 1944, as the children were having breakfast, German trucks rolled up in front of the farmhouse. Mrs. Zlatin was away at the time, arranging for another batch of children to be smuggled to Switzerland. But 7 teachers and 44 children between the ages of 4 and 17 were arrested. Only an assistant to Mrs. Zlatin escaped, managing to squeeze through an upstairs window and hide in the garden.         The rest, including Mrs. Zlatin's husband, were herded into the trucks. Witnesses told of the children being kicked and hurled into the trucks like sacks of potatoes.         Mr. Barbie commanded his officers to transport the captives to deportation centers. As they rode along, jounced about in the back of the trucks, the 44 children sang a song declaring their defiance. They had learned it from their history lessons: ''Vous n'aurez pas l'Alsace et la Lorraine'' (You will not have Alsace and Lorraine).         Mrs. Zlatin learned of the roundup via a telegram that said: ''Family ill. Contagious disease.'' Those were the code words that meant the worst: the Nazis had arrived at Izieu.         At once, Mrs. Zlatin hurried to Vichy to beg for the lives of the children before the collaborationist French government. She was spurned. ''Why do you bother about those dirty Jews?'' a senior French official asked her.         Five of the adults and 42 of the children died in gas chambers at Auschwitz. Mr. Zlatin and the two remaining children were executed by firing squad in Estonia. A single adult, a 25-year-old teacher, managed to survive.         When Mr. Barbie went on trial for crimes against humanity in May 1987, Mrs. Zlatin, then 80, went to testify against his brutalities. The assistant who had escaped from the farmhouse the day of the Izieu raid testified that as he hid outside, he saw Mr. Barbie among the Germans.         Mr. Barbie was convicted and later died in a French prison.       
         Melanie Shroder Totenberg, who acted as business manager for her husband, the violinist Roman Totenberg, for five decades, died on Sunday at her summer home in Blue Hill, Maine. She was 79 and lived in Newton, Mass.         The cause was cancer, the family said.         A longtime New Yorker, she moved in 1963 to Massachussetts. There she was executive vice president of the state's chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action.         She is survived by her husband; three daughters, Nina, of Washington, Jill, of Manhattan, and Amy, of Atlanta; four grandchildren, and a sister, Louisa Schwartz of Washington.       
         Kathleen Carlin, a social service executive who devoted her professional life to the proposition that men can learn to get along quite well without beating up their wives and girlfriends, died on Sept. 20 at a hospice near her home in Atlanta. She was 57 and had been a leading voice in the movement to stop violence against women.         Colleagues said the cause was cancer.         Ms. Carlin, a native of Maywood, Neb., who graduated from the University of Nebraska and received a master's in social work there, married right after college and began raising a family, first in Atlanta and later in Houston. She did not begin her career until the mid-1970's, when she and her family returned to Atlanta and settled there for good.         But once she got started, taking a job in suburban Atlanta as director of Georgia's first shelter for battered women, Ms. Carlin became so outraged by what she viewed as society's indifference to the problem that she was soon in the forefront of national efforts to curb domestic violence.         Although Ms. Carlin held high positions in the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, helped found the National Women's Abuse Prevention Project and was keynote speaker at national conferences, her major contribution came as the executive director of Men Stopping Violence, an organization based in Atlanta that she helped establish in 1982.         With a $5 million annual budget, the group seeks to effect change  across the spectrum of what Ms. Carlin described as a continuum of sanctioned abuse of women. In addition to running programs of intensive behavior modification for men with a history of abusing women and training instructors to operate similar programs across the country, the organization works to change the social norms of male supremacy and control that Ms. Carlin came to see as the underlying causes of abuse.         Although the organization has shown some promise -- for example, winning contracts with the military and religious denominations to help them change their organizational cultures to take the issue seriously -- Ms. Carlin did not need to be reminded that her efforts were barely a beginning.         After all, as she was quick to point out, an estimated 3 million to 4 million women suffer some degree of physical abuse at the hands of men each year, and surveys indicate that women in two-thirds of American marriages are battered at least once by their husbands.         And Ms. Carlin, who saw physical violence as just one extreme measure men use to control women, had an answer for anyone who might suggest that in the vast majority of those marriages the violence was so rare as to be inconsequential. She would be ready with a case history to show that a single beating was often all it took for a man to establish domination.         The case involved a woman whose husband beat her severely one Thanksgiving and never laid a hand on her after that -- because he did not have to. As Ms. Carlin recalled, after that all he had to do when his wife balked at bowing to his wishes was to say ''remember Thanksgiving,'' and the terrified wife would submit.         Just as that wife had learned to conduct herself to avoid the serious consequences of displeasing her husband, Ms. Carlin felt that men would decide not to beat their wives at the exact moment that society came to regard domestic abuse as a serious criminal offense to be dealt with swiftly, surely and severely.         And that, she argued, will never happen until society abandons the notion of across-the-board male domination that tends to justify violence against women in the first place. That may be a tall order, but Ms. Carlin was not one to shrink from a challenge. In 1990, for example, she joined a group of women who scaled Mount Kenya, and for all her frustrations in trying to reform an entire society, she knew how to have a good time.         Indeed, her annual high-spirited Christmas parties made such an impression on her staff and friends that they provided an antidote of sorts to the grim ''remember Thanksgiving'' tag line of Ms. Carlin's anecdote of domestic abuse. Or, as those who vowed to continue her work might put it, ''remember Christmas.''         Ms. Carlin is survived by her husband, John; two daughters, Suzanne Rianhard of San Francisco and Elizabeth Carlin of New York; her mother, Arlene Hough of Atlanta, and a sister, Janet Allen of Dallas.       
         Martha Entenmann, the matriarch of the family that turned a small Bay Shore, L.I., bakery into Entenmann's, one of the nation's largest and best-known baked-goods companies, died yesterday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip, L.I. She was 89 and lived in Islip.         Mrs. Entenmann had suffered from a heart ailment in recent years and died of complications from a recent operation, her son, William 3d, said.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. Entenmann, who married the son of the bakery's founder and was the mother of three sons who operated Entenmann's for decades, took an active role in the company, keeping the books, managing the office and, after her husband died in 1951, sharing managerial decisions with her sons until her retirement 15 years ago.         When Entenmann's went public in 1976, the company's stock certificates bore the picture of Mrs. Entenmann, known as Mrs. E to hundreds of employees at the 14-acre Bay Shore plant where doughnuts, cakes, cookies and other baked goods were packed in white boxes with the blue-bannered Entenmann's label.         Born in Hoboken, N.J., in 1906, the former Martha Schneider was a 19-year-old saleswoman in a Bay Shore bakery in 1925 when she married her boss, William Entenmann Jr., whose father had founded the business in Brooklyn in 1898. Their sons, Robert, Charles and William, all eventually joined the company, which prospered with home deliveries on Long Island despite depression and war.         In the 1950's, after her husband's death, Mrs. Entenmann and her sons stopped making bread and rolls to concentrate on cakes, pies and pastries; ended home deliveries in favor of supermarket chains and grocery stores, and expanded from Long Island to Miami, Chicago and many other cities.         In 1978, Entenmann's was sold to Warner-Lambert, the pharmaceutical company, for $233 million, and in 1982 to General Foods for $315 million. In 1985, General Foods was acquired by Philip Morris, and Entenmann's became part of Kraft Foods. Last year, Entenmann's and three other Kraft brands were bought by CPC International for $865 million.         Mrs. Entenmann is survived by her three sons, Robert, of Riverhead, L.I., Charles, of Oak Beach, L.I., and William 3d, of Islip; eight grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Bass Newlin, an author and former executive editor of Ladies' Home Journal, died at her home in Amagansett, L.I., on Aug. 26. She was 91.         She began her career at the magazine in the mid-1930's as an editorial assistant. She was named executive editor and retained that post until 1963.         Among her writing projects on leaving the magazine was ''Careers at Home,'' a monthly column she wrote for Family Circle magazine from 1967 to 1974. She was also the author of a 1971 book with the same title.         Mrs. Newlin, who was married and widowed four times, was known professionally as Mary Bass for most of her career.         She was born in Chicago and was a graduate of Barnard College.         Her last husband, A. Chauncey Newlin, a lawyer and philanthropist, died in 1983.         She is survived by a son from her second marriage, Richardson Bass of Amagansett.       
         Frances Lear, a mercurial figure in the media world who spent some $25 million she received in a divorce settlement to start a magazine named after herself, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She died of breast cancer, said Dr. Jonathan LaPook, her son-in-law.         Ms. Lear was married for 28 years to Norman Lear, the highly successful television producer of series like ''All in the Family'' and ''Maude.'' Her divorce settlement from Mr. Lear, an amount variously estimated to be between $100 million and $112 million, was one of the largest ever recorded.         ''I was very much a part of his thinking,'' she often said, justifying the amount of the settlement. ''Norman could not have done his shows without me.''         It is generally considered -- and she herself claimed -- that she was the inspiration for Maude, the feisty and opinionated title character played by Bea Arthur.         Ms. Lear made a name for herself among feminists, working in political campaigns, including Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968; with the National Organization for Women on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was not ratified; as a partner in an executive search firm specializing in placing women, and as a writer, producing articles for a number of national publications. But she believed that she had faded into the background as her husband's career took off in the 1970's. After Mr. Lear acquired his own movie studio and founded his own civil liberties group, People for the American Way, she discussed her frustrations in an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times in 1981.         A woman in Hollywood is a nonperson, she wrote, ''unless she is under 21, powerful or a star.'' She noted, too, that an industry wife was looked through, never at. In a later interview, recalling her years as a Hollywood wife, she said she had felt constantly ignored and undervalued, had had little self-esteem and had often been depressed.         Ms. Lear, in her own words, ''always aspired to something out of the ordinary,'' and she moved to New York after her divorce in 1985. She quickly set out to change the nonperson identity she had felt in Hollywood by creating Lear's, a magazine aimed at women like herself -- ''the woman who wasn't born yesterday,'' as the magazine said on its cover.         Lear's began publication in 1988 and was a success. It began with a circulation base of 250,000 and grew to 350,000 in a year. But after two years, Ms. Lear abandoned her original concept and lowered the age of the theoretical Lear's woman to over 35. Abandoning the older-age niche put the magazine into competition with other women's magazines, and its advertising never recovered from the move.         Almost immediately after the magazine's debut, Ms. Lear developed a reputation for being unpredictable and hot-tempered. She held a series of intimate lunches in her apartment during which she sought, and then usually ignored, advice for her fledgling publication. She also frequently brought up more of her personal history than most of her guests were prepared for, revealing that she had a Dickensian childhood, that doctors had determined that she was manic-depressive and had prescribed lithium for her condition, that she was an alcoholic and that she had made several suicide attempts over the years.         There ensued a revolving door of editors and writers, many of whom complained of Ms. Lear's inexperience and capricious decisions. Numerous articles were accepted and not published, and layouts were changed at the last minute. In an article in The New York Times, a staff member recalled that when Ms. Lear had been told that she could not change a quotation, she had shouted, ''It is my magazine, and I will do what I want.''         A former associate once said of her, ''She spent her life in Hollywood, where you go on your gut and you are prized for being slightly nuts.'' Ms. Lear did not deny the validity of the remark. She had lived with that behavior for many years, she said, and ''very possibly some of it rubbed off.''         Although circulation was more than 500,000 in its final months, Lear's ceased publication in March 1994. It had lost an estimated $25 million to $30 million in its six years of operation.         Ms. Lear then formed Lear Television, investing $500,000 in a video production company. The videos, which she referred to as ''television books,'' were specifically for women and dealt with subjects like personal finances and relationships. She had also just completed a book, ''Frances Lear's Guide to Work and Family in the 21st Century,'' which does not yet have a publisher.         Ms. Lear was born on July 14, 1923, at the Vanderheusen Home for Wayward Girls in Hudson, N.Y., the child of an unwed mother and an unknown father. ''The odds were stacked high against me,'' she once said. She was given the name Evelyn, but she was renamed Frances when she was adopted after 14 months in an orphanage by Aline and Herbert Loeb of Larchmont, N.Y.         ''Aline was outwardly affectionate with me for my father's sake, but she did not like me,'' Ms. Lear wrote in ''The Second Seduction,'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1992) an autobiography that pulled no punches. The slim volume laid out in harrowing detail her personal history and most intimate experiences.         The memoir related her years of sexual abuse, beginning at age 12, by the man whom her adoptive mother married after Mr. Loeb committed suicide during the Depression. She told, too, of being sent to a psychiatrist, to whom she revealed her stepfather's abuse, and of the psychiatrist's betrayal in repeating her confidences to her mother and stepfather. Her stepfather, she wrote, ''met me at the door with a kitchen knife in his hand.'' Her mother ''turned and left the room, went into her bedroom, closed the door and protected her economic hide.'' On her mother's death, her stepfather was left 90 percent of the $100,000 remaining from Mr. Loeb's insurance, Ms. Lear said.         Ms. Lear attended the Mary A. Burnham School for Girls in Northampton, Mass. In the 1940's and early 50's, she held a number of jobs, primarily in advertising and retailing in New York. She was, she never hesitated to say, dismissed from most of them for behavior like listening in on the boss's telephone conversations and drinking through lunch.         For a brief period, she was the camera girl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York. The job ended when she asked Frank Costello, the camera-shy gangster, whether he would like to have his picture taken. Her boss grabbed her under her armpits, lifted her into the air, carried her into the street, set her down, kissed her goodbye and advised her to try another line of work.         Ms. Lear had two short-lived marriages before she met Mr. Lear. Her first marriage, to Arnold Weiss, a traffic manager at the Navy Yard in Charleston, S.C., lasted less than two years. Her second marriage, to Morton Kaufman (''or Kauffman or Kaufmann -- I cannot remember how to spell my second husband's name,'' she wrote in the autobiography), was dissolved within a year. She said that he had been unfaithful, leading to her first suicide attempt and three weeks in the psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital.         ''I tried to commit suicide three times seriously and three times with minimal interest in the outcome,'' she once said.         She was 33 and a buyer for better active sportswear at Lord & Taylor when she married Mr. Lear, who was then a television writer, and moved to California. She turned down a buyer's job with a Los Angeles store and concentrated on homemaking and rearing her two daughters.         One day, she recalled, she realized that ''we had become he.'' She began to think seriously of leaving her marriage. It took her 15 years, she said, ''to work up the courage.''         ''I believe the second half of one's life is meant to be better than the first half,'' she said in an interview last year. ''It is certainly true of me.''         Ms. Lear is survived by her two daughters, Maggie Beth Lear and Kate Breckir Lear (who is married to Dr. LaPook), both of Manhattan, and two grandsons.       
         Cynthia Novack, an improvisational dancer and a writer and teacher, died on Sept. 27 at home in Manhattan. She was 49.         The cause was cancer, said Richard Bull, her husband.         Ms. Novack performed with the Richard Bull Dance Theater and the Improvisational Arts Ensemble, companies devoted to freewheeling yet small-scale and intimate performances of improvisational dance, which she founded with Mr. Bull.         She taught at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, at Barnard College and at the State University of New York at Brockport before joining the dance faculty at Wesleyan University in 1983. At the time of her death, she was an associate professor of dance and women's studies at the university.         Ms. Novack wrote for publications including The Drama Review, Ethnomusicology, and Women and Performance. She was the author of ''Sharing the Dance: Contact Improvisation and American Culture'' (1990) and was at work on a book about choreography and improvisation.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a stepdaughter, Katie Bull-Prichett of Manhattan, and a granddaughter.       
         Janice A. Burns, a writer and speaker on AIDS who sought to awaken and educate a wider audience, especially young people, to its realities, died of the disease on Sept. 28 at St. John's Hospital in Yonkers.         Mrs. Burns was 33 and a Yonkers resident, said Melinda Mullin, her associate and press agent.         Mrs. Burns was the author of ''Sarah's Song,'' the story of her life with her husband and former childhood sweetheart, William Burns, and their struggle to accept and live with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Mr. Burns died of AIDS in 1994.         Critics described the book, which was named for the child the Burnses never had, as both poetic and brutally specific, full of pain and anger, a plea for understanding and an exhortation to live life, come what may. The author contracted the virus from her husband, who had become infected during an earlier relationship.         ''Sarah's Song,'' published by Warner Books last year, had a hard-cover printing of 30,000 copies. The book came out in paperback on Oct. 1, with a printing of 50,000 copies.         Mrs. Burns, whose maiden name was O'Reilly, was born in the Bronx and graduated from Trinity College in Washington. She earned a master's degree in psychology at New York University and worked as a researcher in the Department of Psychiatry at New York University Medical Center until her illness forced her to retire in 1992.         She played an active role in various organizations concerned with AIDS and last March delivered the keynote speech at the Westchester County Women's Annual Hall of Fame event. Since 1990 she had also pursued a mission she considered vital: speaking to thousands of high school students about her experience on behalf of Community Services in Westchester, an AIDS-related organization.         She is survived by her parents, Joan and John O'Reilly of Fishkill, N.Y.; two sisters, Dolores Rezendes of Duxbury, Mass., and Maureen Stano of Kansas City, Mo., and a brother, Steve O'Reilly of Brookfield, Conn.       
         Mimi Coleman Thompson, an officer and past board chairwoman of Planned Parenthood of New York City, who also had long associations with Hofstra University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, died on Wednesday at her home in Old Brookville, L.I. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Thompson, a member of one of New York's most historically prominent families, was a highly visible presence in philanthropy and community service for much of her life, both on Long Island and in New York City.         She was a founder, in 1987, fund-raiser and most recently vice president of the American Skin Association, with its headquarters in New York City. The organization supports research in dermatology and skin disorders and their cure.         Mrs. Thompson first worked as a volunteer for the American Red Cross in the 1950's, organizing blood donation campaigns.         In the 1960's, she was an officer and board member of what is now the Five Towns Community Center of Lawrence, L.I., a gathering place for underprivileged children. She also served as a trustee of the Lawrence Country Day School in Hewlett Bay Park, L.I. -- before its merger with Woodmere Academy -- and raised the money for a new gymnasium, whose construction she guided.         She then was vice chairwoman of the trustees of Hofstra. She was a force in the establishment of its law school and in making Hofstra one of the first universities in the state to be fully accessible to the handicapped.         At the medical center, she was, among other things, co-chairwoman for 14 years of the Visitors Day program, which informs the public of important medical advances.         She began her work for Planned Parenthood as a fund-raiser in the 1980's, serving as chairwoman from 1983 to 1987. At her death, she was the head of a committee concerned with the training of clinicians.         She was born Louise Stuyvesant Wainwright, a direct descendant of Peter Stuyvesant, the Dutch Governor who surrendered New Amsterdam to the British. For 36 years, she was married to Charles Payson Coleman, who was managing law parter of Davis Polk & Wardwell at his death in 1982.         She is survived by her husband of four years, William D. Thompson; three daughters, Linda Coleman of Southampton, L.I., and Penny Coleman and Susan C. Bynum, both of Manhattan; a son, Payson Coleman of Old Brookville; a sister, Patricia Bonicatti of Rome; a brother, Peter S. Wainwright of Scottsdale, Ariz., and nine grandchildren.       
         Laura La Plante, an early screen star who made the transition from silent screams to audible sobs and songs, died on Monday at the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 92.         In a career in which she appeared in some 75 films, many in the silent era, Miss La Plante was cast primarily as a comedian but demonstrated considerable dramatic range.         If a villain needed a heroine to tie to the railroad tracks in the face of an onrushing train, for example, Miss La Plante could be counted on to wriggle and squirm convincingly until the hero rescued her in the nick of time.         Perhaps her most famous role was as the heroine in the 1927 silent classic, ''The Cat and the Canary,'' still studied as the progenitor of the English manor house movie thriller, in this case with flashes of comedy.         She also became something of a footnote to Hollywood history as the first woman to sing on screen when she was actually heard singing and sobbing in the original film version of ''Show Boat,'' in 1929.         The daughter of a Missouri farmer with an ear for alliteration, Miss La Plante, who was born on a farm outside St. Louis, really was given that unlikely name at birth, almost. The original version of La Plante, her son explained yesterday, had no ''e'' at the end, but she added one, without prompting by studio executives, after friends pointed out it needed a proper feminine French ending to go with the ''La.''         At a time when movie acting was not regarded as entirely respectable, Miss La Plante, who came to Hollywood with her schoolteacher mother after her parents' divorce, got her first job on a lark, winning a role as an extra at the age of 15.         Within two years, she had won a contract from Universal and was well on her way to becoming one of the most famous women in America, appearing first in Hoot Gibson westerns and the like and then in leading roles opposite Reginald Denny, especially after the director William Seitzer persuaded her to bob and bleach her long brown hair.         She and Mr. Seitzer were married in 1926 and divorced in 1932, three months before Miss La Plante, who had been making a movie in London, married Irving Asher, a producer who had been running the Warner Brothers studio in London.         For all the bride's movie star fame, the couple were upstaged at their wedding by their official witness, Mr. Asher's pal, the former New York City Mayor, James J. Walker.         The next year, while Miss La Plante was staying at Mr. Walker's thatched-roof cottage in Surrey, the house burned to the ground, destroying all the papers and documents he had accumulated during his two years in office before resigning under a cloud in 1932.         Although there were some sniggling suggestions that the papers, at least, had been deliberately torched to hide evidence of the former Mayor's suspected corruption, Miss La Plante's son insisted that the fire had been entirely accidental. Indeed, he said, when his mother, who was ill in bed at the time and eventually had to be carried to safety out a window, was told by a maid that ''the thatch is alight, Mum,'' she shrugged off the news, thinking merely that a cozy fire had been started in the fireplace.         Miss La Plante largely retired from the screen after her marriage, making only a few movies after that while becoming a somewhat offbeat Hollywood hostess.         When friends like William Holden or Hal Wallis came to dine, Mr. Asher inevitably did the cooking, while Miss La Plante, who had learned the art in London from Somerset Maugham's wife, Syrie, wowed the guests with her stunning flower arrangements.         Miss La Plante, whose husband died in 1985, is survived by a daughter, Jill Murray of Mill Valley, Calif.; a son, Tony Asher of Los Angeles, and a grandson.         Correction:  October 22, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Laura La Plante on Thursday misspelled the surname of her first husband. He was William Seiter.       
         Hannah Green, an acclaimed author who wrote one slender novel of such delicately distilled perfection that she could hardly bring herself to compose another, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital in Manhattan, six months after the reissue of her classic work, ''The Dead of the House,'' had been received with almost as much critical enthusiasm as its original publication a generation ago. She was 69 and lived in Greenwich Village.         Her husband, the painter John Wesley, said the cause was lung cancer.         ''The Dead of the House'' was, by format, just another example of a well-worn genre, a coming-of-age novel, in this case a fictionalized account of Ms. Green's childhood in an Ohio village and on the summertime shores of Lake Michigan.         But in her hands the familiar pangs of childhood, the adolescent passage from virginity to passion and the sobering loss of a first love were so exquisitely wrought that critics were instantly smitten.         Indeed, when ''The Dead of the House'' was published by Doubleday in 1972, the author Richard Ellman said reading it was like falling in love.         ''I was, for as long as it took,'' he wrote in The New York Times Book Review, ''able to surrender my own callowness and smugness to the ecstasy that is fiction, is art.''         Other critics had similar praise, which was echoed when Books & Company/Turtle Point Press reissued the book this year. If such enthusiasm seems extreme for what was, after all, a first novel, there was ample evidence that this was a very special first novel. Among other things, the budding first novelist was 46 years old and had been working on the book for the better part of two decades.         She was also a highly schooled professional who had studied with Vladmir Nabokov at Wellesley and with Wallace Stegner while obtaining a master's degree at Stanford. She taught at Stanford for a while before coming to New York and beginning a part-time career as a teacher of creative writing, first at Columbia and later at New York University.         Ms. Green, a native of Glendale, Ohio, was also a precocious child who early on encountered the frustrations of writing that would bedevil her the rest of her life. When she was 4, her husband said, she dreamed up a story about a mischievous pig, but in trying to compose it on her slate could not even get through the title. Her childhood scrawl was so large that she ran out of space after ''The Misch.''         In later years Ms. Green's problem was not her handwriting (she composed on a manual typewriter) but her almost obsessive pursuit of a perfection that always seemed just one rewrite away.         The real wonder of ''The Dead of the House,'' her husband suggested, was not that it took so long, but that it was finished at all. ''She never wanted to let go,'' he said.         A tall, dark-haired woman who dressed conventionally and had an open, unassuming smile, away from the typewriter she seemed anything but an artist. Still, she had her transcendent moments, like the time she and her future husband met. A boyfriend had taken her to a party at Mr. Wesley's studio, the painter recalled,  and while the other guests downed canapes and quaffed beer with gusto, she approached him and asked for an orange.         By some coincidence, he said, he did have an orange, and it was immediate love.         The couple were married in 1971, and a few years later, while traveling in France, Ms. Green had another transcendent moment when at a church in Conques, in south-central France, she encountered the bones of Saint Foy, one of the last martyrs to Roman rule.         ''It blew the top of her head off,'' Mr. Wesley said, noting that for the last 25 years his wife had been writing -- and rewriting -- a book about the martyred 12-year-old girl who was betrayed by her father, refused to renounce her faith and put to death, inspiring a cult that continues in France.         Ms. Green's book, ''Golden Spark, Little Saint: My Book of the Hours of Saint Foy,'' which combines fiction with factual accounts of the Conques region and its people, is to be published by Random House next year.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Mary Lonsdale Hickler of Warwick, Mass.       
         Magda Trocme, a French parson's wife who opened her door to a single shivering refugee in 1940 and helped inspire a movement that saved thousands of Jews and others from the Nazis in World War II, died on Oct. 10 a hospital in Paris. She was 94 and lived in Paris.         Although she was a heroine to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Memorial Authority, to her dying day Mrs. Trocme could not comprehend a world that regarded it as in any way remarkable that she, her husband, and thousands of other residents of the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in the plateau region of southern France had risked their lives to feed, clothe, hide and protect those who would have died without their help.         But then Mrs. Trocme was an anomaly, a free-thinking woman whose life was dedicated to the curious principle that just as food is the answer to hunger the only rational antidote to violence is nonviolence.         Mrs. Trocme owed her own prominence in the rescue movement in part to the fact that her husband, Andre Trocme, was the charismatic pacifist pastor of the French Reformed Church in Chambon, a founder of the Cevenol boarding school there and a recognized leader of the rescue effort, which has been credited with saving some 5,000 refugees, about 3,500 of them Jewish, many of them children.         But as scores of refugees who came to her own door discovered, Mrs. Trocme was more than her husband's shadow; she was a highly organized, tireless and practical woman who knew how to find food when there was no food and just which door to knock on to find room and welcome for those her own overburdened household could not accommodate.         The almost unanimous support the rescue movement enjoyed in the area around Chambon is generally attributed to the mostly Protestant peasant population's identification with the victims of persecution.         But neither her husband nor Mrs. Trocme were natives of the region. Mrs. Trocme, whose paternal grandfather was a refugee from Czarist Russia and whose father was an engineer who had been a colonel in the Italian cavalry, was born in Florence, where she had an unconventional reaction to a conventional Catholic upbringing. While a convent student, she rejected the Church and embraced Protestantism.         While studying on a scholarship at the old School of Social Work in New York in 1925, she met Mr. Trocme, a  Protestant from northern France who was studying at the Union Theological Seminary. They were married in 1926.         After his ordination, Mr. Trocme, who was something of a free-thinker himself (he had renounced violence and become a conscientious objector in World War I) was regarded as so much of a rebel in the French Protestant church that he was sent in 1934 to Chambon in southern France, a region with a long history of tolerance since the days it had become a refuge for Huguenots fleeing the purges of Catholic France.         Like her husband, Mrs. Trocme, who taught Italian at the Cevenol school, was a thoroughgoing pacifist. But many of the villagers and farmers of the region were not. Under the rule of the collaborationist Vichy Government and the later German occupation many of them took part in the Resistance activities that were common throughout France, but what set the Chambon area apart was its role as a place of refuge.         Although her open-hearted welcome to the Jewish woman who knocked on her door one snowy night in 1940 has been considered the beginning of the Chambon movement, Mrs. Trocme's daughter, Nelly Hewitt of Minneapolis, stressed yesterday that in an area where secrecy was a way of life and virtually every home eventually harbored one or more refugees, it is impossible to know whether her mother had been the first.         Mrs. Trocme's initial effort almost backfired, her daughter recalled, when she placed her visitor's soaked shoes next to the hearth to dry and they caught fire.         After the war, Mr. Trocme became the European secretary for the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an American-based pacifist group, and during the 1950's he and his wife made fund-raising tours of the United States. He later became pastor of a church in Geneva, and after his death in 1971, Mrs. Trocme retired to Paris.         There she wondered at the attention her efforts had received over the years, including a 1989 book by Philip P. Hallie, ''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed,'' and a television documentary, ''Weapons of the Spirit.''         To her mind, at least, she had done nothing more than provide the obvious help to those in obvious need. She no more understood the fuss over her efforts to rescue Jews than the consternation she caused her neighbors  when policemen came to arrest her husband (he was later released) and she served them dinner.         ''I don't understand,'' she said. ''It was dinner time.''         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Trocme is survived by a son, Jacques, of Paris, 10 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 9, 1996, Saturday         An obituary on Oct. 19 about Magda Trocme, a Frenchwoman who helped shield Jewish refugees from the Nazis in World War II, misspelled the name of her daughter and misstated the daughter's hometown. She is Nelly Hewett, not Hewitt, of St. Paul, not Minneapolis.       
         Edith Tilton Penrose, an American-born British economist who was an authority on corporate growth and on oil, died on Oct. 11 in Waterbeach -- near Cambridge, England -- where she lived. She was 81.         Her death was reported on Saturday by The Guardian and The Independent.         Dr. Penrose, whose doctorate was from Johns Hopkins University, retired in 1978 as a professor at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, where she concurrently headed the school's economics department. In later years she was a professor and a dean at the Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affaires in Fontainebleau, France.         Her best-known book is ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' (1959, Oxford), about the ways companies grow and the reasons why they do. Jay B. Barney, a professor of management at Ohio State University, writing in a management journal last year, called it a seminal work about ''the competitive implications of a firm's internal strengths and weaknesses.''         A Scottish economist, Sir Alec Cairncross, recalled in The Independent on Saturday, that the book brought Dr. Penrose ''instant recognition as a creative thinker, and its importance to the analysis of the job of management has been increasingly realized.''         In theorizing about companies, Dr. Penrose held that, as The Guardian  put it: ''There are important administrative restraints on the speed of the firm's growth. Human resources required for the management of change are tied to the individual firm and so are internally scarce. Expansion requires the recruitment of more such resources. New recruits cannot become fully effective overnight. The growth process is, therefore, dynamically constrained.''         Dr. Penrose's interest in oil originated in the late 1950's, when she was a visiting professor at the University of Baghdad. In a 1976 interview, she recalled: ''I was doing a book on multinational corporations, although nobody called them that in those days. Being in Iraq, it would have been rather silly not to concentrate on oil, wouldn't it?''         That book, ''The Large International Firm in Developing Countries: The International Petroleum Industry,'' was published in 1968, and by 1976 she was considered one of the top oil economists in the world.         In the 1976 interview, she said: ''Historically, the international oil companies often have wielded their vast power selfishly, although their accomplishments have often been beneficial to the world.'' By that time, oil executives had often been less than pleased with conclusions expressed in her writings, but she contended: ''I don't take sides. I just gather the facts and if people don't like my work, they just don't like the facts.''         Edith Tilton was born in Los Angeles and received a bachelor's degree in 1936 from the University of California at Berkeley. After working for the American Embassy in London, she received her doctorate in 1950. Her first book, ''Economics of the International Patent System,'' was published in 1951.         Dr. Penrose was a lecturer and research associate at Johns Hopkins for many years. Sir Alec wrote that after a campaign she and her husband, Ernest F. Penrose, a British-born economist and writer, ''conducted in support of Owen Lattimore, a professor accused of un-American activities,'' the couple ''fell afoul of McCarthy and were more or less exiled, first to the Australian National University in Canberra and then to Baghdad University.'' Then the couple moved to Britain.         Dr. Penrose married David Burton Denhardt in 1934; he died in 1938. She married Mr. Penrose in 1944; he died in 1984. Her survivors include three sons.       
         Ruth Lewis Farkas, who was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1973 after she and her husband, the founder of the Alexander's department stores, contributed $300,000 to President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign, died on Friday at the Park Avenue home of her son Robin. She was 89.         Mrs. Farkas, who lived in Palm Beach, Fla., had been staying with Mr. Farkas and his wife, Carol, a nurse, in Manhattan since her release two weeks ago from the New York University Medical Center, where she had been treated for a heart ailment.         Despite the uproar that surrounded Mrs. Farkas's appointment and a delay in her Senate confirmation, her posting caused little stir in the tiny grand duchy of Luxembourg, which was accustomed to Americans whose path to ambassadorships was paved with political contributions.         Although Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas cast his Foreign Relations committee vote against her and denounced her appointment as demeaning the Foreign Service, Senator Gale W. McGee of Wyoming said he was satisfied that Mrs. Farkas was innocent of any impropriety and laughed about the custom of making envoys of people who make generous campaign contributions.         ''The money -- that's par for the course,'' he said. ''It used to be a cheaper price -- but that's Nixon inflation.''         In contrast to Ambassador Perle Mesta, the Washington socialite who arrived in Luxembourg in 1949 with flamboyant ways and gala parties that inspired the Broadway musical ''Call Me Madam,'' Mrs. Farkas, who held a doctorate in sociology from Columbia University and a doctorate in education from New York University, maintained a low profile.         Reserved by nature and press-shy because of the uproar that surrounded her appointment, she was more at ease as the sponsor of forums on the drug problems of teen-agers than in being a second coming of a woman known as the hostess with the mostest.         Not until two years after Mrs. Farkas arrived did she make her first splash in the social life of Luxembourg, with a charity gala that featured the singer Sacha Distel and a United States Army orchestra. The event took in $28,000 for a school for handicapped children.         She maintained close ties with the Government, gave quiet and unpretentious parties and, unlike many envoys, avoided making political statements about United States policy. Most diplomatic work was carried out by her six-member staff, and in the Luxembourg diplomatic community, which then included 13 other ambassadors, Mrs. Farkas, though serious, was not considered a heavyweight.         President Gerald R. Ford accepted her resignation in 1976 and replaced her with Rosemary L. Ginn, a longtime Republican national committeewoman from Missouri.         Mrs. Farkas settled in Florida and resumed her many philanthropic and humanitarian activities and research into male and female roles through the Role Foundation, which she established in 1967.         Ruth Lewis, one of five children of Samuel Lewis and the former Jennie Bach, was born in Manhattan in 1906. Both her parents were in the real estate business and each influenced her. ''Community living and sharing, that was my mother; intellectual pursuits, that was my father,'' Mrs. Farkas once said.         Accompanying her mother into tenements taught her about poverty, and Mrs. Farkas never forgot her mother's advice: ''No matter what your station in life, no matter what you grow up to be, always try to  contribute to those less fortunate than you.''         She met George Farkas when she was 10. Their families lived in the same apartment house, at 107th Street and Fifth Avenue, where George, whose father had died, kept a close eye on his little sister, who was Ruth Lewis's best friend.         ''I didn't like him at first because he was such a boss,'' she said.         They were married in 1928, but not until she graduated from New York University. She received a master's degree from Columbia in 1932 and  was for many years a member of the executive committee of Alexander's.         Mr. Farkas died in 1980.         In addition to Robin, Mrs. Farkas is survived by three other sons, Alexander of Highland Park, Fla., and  Bruce and Jonathan, of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Fritz and Ingeborg Kahlenberg, exiled Germans who met during World War II as members of Hidden Camera, a Dutch Resistance group that documented the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, died this month at New York University Hospital within two weeks of each other.         The Kahlenbergs, who established Film Authors, a New York film production company after they immigrated to the United States in 1946, lived in Manhattan. Mr. Kahlenberg, 80, died on Oct. 15; Mrs. Kahlenberg, 76, died on Oct. 2.         The couple's daughter, Liz Kahlenberg Bordow, said her mother had died of lung cancer and her father of complications of kidney failure.         Working secretly, the Hidden Camera photographers, led by Mr. Kahlenberg, hoarded rationed film, snapped pictures with cameras concealed in coats or handbags, developed the photographs and, in some cases, tried to smuggle them out of the country.         Under the title ''The Illegal Camera: Photography in the Netherlands During the German Occupation, 1940-1945,'' an exhibition of 75 photographs taken by members of the Hidden Camera opened in August at the Jewish Museum, at Fifth Avenue and 92d Street, where it is to run until Dec. 1.         In addition to the persecution of the Jews, the photographs at the museum cover warfare and occupation, confiscation of goods, compulsory labor, resistance, the ''Hunger Winter'' of 1944-45 when starvation was rampant, and liberation.         One of the most widely known of the Hidden Camera photographs, taken by Cas Oorthuys and included by Edward Steichen in his collection ''The Family of Man,'' studies the face of a sunken-eyed woman gnawing on a crust of bread.         ''The pictures are painful to look at,'' Sarah Boxer wrote in her review in The New York Times.         Henry Kol, the Dutch consul for press and cultural affairs in New York, credited photographs taken by Hidden Camera with providing evidence that enabled the Dutch Government in exile to persuade the Red Cross to arrange food drops.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, who was taught by her husband to operate a camera, was also involved in resistance communications, transporting munitions and the use of forged documents.         Mr. Kahlenberg, who was born in Berlin, where his father was a founder of the U.F.A. film studio, settled in Amsterdam after Hitler came to power and was a film distributor when World War II began.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, whose maiden name was Wallheimer, was born in Bremen and moved to Amsterdam with her family in 1939.         The couple, cited by the Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, for their resistance activities, were married in 1946 and settled in New York.         For a time, Mr. Kahlenberg was a producer with Telenews, which provided newsreels to movie theaters. In the 1950's, the Kahlenbergs founded Film Authors, a production company.         They produced a wide variety of documentary and travel films for such clients as Pan American Airways, the Icelandic and Scandinavian Travel Bureaus, Holland America Lines and Bermuda. David Frost, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters were among the narrators.         In addition to their daughter, of Berkeley, Calif., they are survived by  a grandchild.         Mr. Kahlenberg is also survived by a brother, Hans Kahlenberg of Chiddingfold, England. Mrs. Kahlenberg is survived by a brother, Gunthur Wallheimer, and a sister, Helga Ekker, both of Amsterdam.       
         Constance Woodruff, who was active in labor and women's issues and was a Democratic Party stalwart, died on Saturday at St. Michael's Medical Center in Newark. She was 74 and lived in West Orange, N.J.         The cause was cancer, said Jan M. Johnson, executive editor of City News in Plainfield, N.J., for which Mrs. Woodruff wrote political commentary until her illness was diagnosed in the spring.         Mrs. Woodruff was a Democratic National Committeewoman for two terms. She was co-chairwoman of the New Jersey delegation at the 1976 National Democratic Convention.         Six governors, starting with Gov. Richard J. Hughes in the 60's, named her to state commissions. In 1975, Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed her the first chairwoman of the State Advisory Commission on the Status of Women despite objections to her strong partisan identification as the secretary of the State Democratic Committee.         She was the chairwoman of the commission for 16 years, traveling the state to foster similar bodies at the county level. She was twice elected to lead the national umbrella Association of Commissions on Women, of which she eventually became president emeritus. The national group advises state organizations, like the New Jersey Division on Women, on issues deemed important to women.         She was born in Newark, and was city editor of the Herald-News of Newark, a black-oriented weekly.         Later, during two decades with the International Ladies Garment Workers, she directed community relations for the union's eastern region.         Along the way, she graduated from Empire State College and got a master's in labor studies from Rutgers University.         She was an adjunct professor of labor studies at Rutgers-Newark and spent her last 10 years in education as director of public relations and development for Essex County College.         Mrs. Woodruff is survived by a sister, Gwendolyn Williams of Petersburg, Va., and a brother, Leon Rochester of East Orange. Her husband of 42 years, Bill Woodruff, died in April.       
         Charlotte H. Dinger, a New Jersey housewife who a paid a chance visit to a Philadelphia antiques shop in 1972 and walked out with the foundation of an unlikely collection and an even less likely career, died on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Morristown, N.J. She was 66, and known as the nation's leading collector and foremost authority on antique carved horses and other carousel art.         Her husband, Carl W. Dinger Jr., said the cause was a heart attack.         To hear her tell it in later years, Mrs. Dinger had two transforming experiences in her life.         The first occurred during a childhood visit to the old Olympic Park in Maplewood, N.J., where she became so enchanted with the flamboyantly beautiful wooden horses whirling around the amusement park's carousel that she promptly announced she wanted one of her own.         The second came on the 1972 visit to the antiques store, where she encountered an old and faded carousel horse that for all its obvious neglect and disrepair evoked such a powerful nostalgic recollection of her bright childhood fascination that she paid $75 for it on the spot.         By the time she got it home and began stripping away the successive layers of thick paint that had obscured the delicate carved features underneath, her old childhood fascination was well on the way to becoming a full-blown adult obsession.         Fired by her initial purchase, Mrs. Dinger soon tracked down what she recognized as a treasure trove of two dozen carousel horses stacked like so much cordwood in a Philadelphia warehouse. Their next stop was the Dinger garage.         (It's a safe bet that there aren't many such warehouse troves left. By the time Mrs. Dinger was in full swing, figures stripped from the thousands of carousels that operated  at the turn of the century were recognized as valuable examples of a neglected art.)         Her husband, only mildly irritated at the loss of space for the family cars, could hardly complain. He, too, was a collector, but then again his collection of baseball cards did not require repeated additions to the couple's Morristown home.         Over the next two decades Mrs. Dinger tracked down, bought and restored scores of horses and other carousel figures. She became familiar with the history of the American carousel, from its beginnings in 1867 with the work of a German immigrant, Gustav Dentzel, to its decline after the introduction of the automobile and its abrupt demise in the Depression.         She became an expert in the subtle distinctions of the work of such carousel masters as Charles Loof (known for friendly, smiling steeds) and Sol Stein and Harry Goldstein (the Central Park Carousel).         She helped found the American Carousel Society to spread the word among other collectors and carousel lovers. She started her own publishing company to produce a definitive coffee table book, ''Art of the Carousel.''         When her collection threatened to outstrip the capacity of her home, she put together a traveling exhibition that was displayed at museums across the country.         As other collectors, recognizing that antique carousel figures were not merely curiosities or so much junk but examples of an important American folk art, bid up the prices of choice specimens to astronomical levels (as much as $175,000), she became a consultant to Sotheby's.         And finally, concerned about the wear and tear of constant travel on her own increasingly valuable figures, she established a permanent home for more than 100 of her best pieces at Carousel World, a museum and working carousel she helped establish at Peddler's Village in Lahaska, Pa., outside New Hope.         Anyone who hasn't seen them there may have caught a glimpse of a few of her prize pieces in the family mail. The United States Postal Service has twice used Mrs. Dinger's collection as the basis for an issue of commemorative stamps depicting carousel animals.         Despite her interest in collecting individual carousel figures, Mrs. Dinger campaigned to keep the dwindling supply of working carousels intact. (According to the American Carousel Society, which estimates there were once 3,000 to 6,000 carousels in the country, from the famous Flying Horses on Martha's Vineyard, where children still ride on the oldest American carousel, assembled in 1884, to the last carousels produced in the 1920's, there are now only 133 left.)         And all her instincts as a collector and her appreciation of carousels and carousel figures as art, Mrs. Dinger never forgot her initial childhood fascination with the fairy tale experience of whirling around on a noble horse.         During her many visits to carousels across the country, Mrs. Dinger was never content just to look. She always climbed aboard and took a ride.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Carl Dinger 3d of Sugarland Tex., and Jeff, of Morris Plains, N.J., and two granddaughters.       
         Diana Trilling, an uncompromising cultural and social critic and a member of the circle of writers, thinkers and polemicists of the 1930's, 40's and 50's known as the New York intellectuals, died on Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         At one point, as a critic for The Nation, Mrs. Trilling read a novel a day for six and a half years, delivering challenging reviews on some of the most important works of the modern era: Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited,'' Robert Penn Warren's ''All the King's Men,'' Jean-Paul Sartre's ''Age of Reason'' and George Orwell's ''1984.''         As a reviewer, she approached her work with ''force, control and precision,'' said Paul Fussell, the scholar and author, in his introduction to a collection of her criticism titled ''Reviewing the Forties'' (Harcourt Brace, 1978). Her theme, he said, was ''the threat of monomanias and systems and theories and sentimentalities to fiction.'' Above all, he said, she was ''impatient with simplicities,'' but ''generous in recognizing real merit.''         As an intellectual living through the Depression, the rise and fall of Fascism and Communism, World War II, the Holocaust, Prohibition and the sexual revolution, Diana Trilling clung to an old-fashioned ethos.         ''My first responsibility was to my home and family,'' she once said. ''I was able to deceive myself that it was a matter of free will and competence that I took on the tasks of the home.'' She credited her husband, Lionel Trilling -- one of the century's foremost literary critics and teachers and the author of works like ''The Liberal Imagination'' that became central documents of American intellectual life -- with her success and development as a critical writer, even as she struggled to establish herself in her own right in later years.         Keeping the Flame, While Breaking Free         To everyone, she was a complicated woman, with a passion for language, a zest for cultural contention and a sharp, usually unforgiving pen. Robert Lowell called her ''a housekeeping goddess of reason.''         She began writing in 1941 and never stopped. Fifty-four years later, in her 90th year, with failing eyesight, she composed a 75-page article on the Welsh literary figure Goronwey Rees, offered it for publication to The New Yorker, then headed for her summer home on Cape Cod. Later, back in her ground-floor apartment on Claremont Avenue near Columbia University, she resumed her routine of writing from 9 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon, five days a week.         She believed that ''writers are what they write, also what they fail to write.'' No novels, no volumes of poetry or short fiction bear her name, but among her credits are five books. These include three collections of essays and reviews and an impressionistic piece of journalism, ''Mrs. Harris: The Death of the Scarsdale Diet Doctor'' (Harcourt Brace, 1981), about the sensational murder trial of Jean Harris, the headmistress of an exclusive girls' school, for the murder of her lover. She also wrote ''The Beginning of the Journey'' (Harcourt Brace, 1993), sometimes a memoir, sometimes an apologia, often a long letter of rebuke to those who thought of her as little more than a sidekick to the scholar with whom she lived for 46 years.         Still, the task of keeping Lionel Trilling's flame while trying to break free of its light sometimes seemed to envelop her. She once told an interviewer that the headline on her obituary would read: ''Diana Trilling Dies at 150. Widow of Distinguished Professor and Literary Critic Lionel Trilling.''         His expertise was acquired; he held a doctorate from Columbia University, taught there in the company of brilliant colleagues and challenged students who went on to produce some of the country's finest literature and criticism. Her expertise, on the other hand, was intuitive; her Radcliffe degree in fine arts, she said, left her ill-prepared for anything except a walk through a gallery or a museum.         ''I graduated from Radcliffe without having read a line of Homer or Dante or Chaucer, without knowing anything of Shakespeare,'' she said. So she learned from her husband, ''casually, unconsciously, by association,'' and along the way discovered that she had a natural acuity for language and an innate sense of what made a good book work.         She suggested in her memoir that Lionel Trilling often used her as an editor and tutor on style. ''What I was trying to bring to his writing was a greater directness and greater fluidity,'' she wrote. Nevertheless, she never doubted ''that, of the two of us, he was the more important writer.'' Her husband ''had more to say than I and a great deal more resonated from what he wrote.''         Her work appeared in some of the best magazines in the country, including The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Harper's and The Saturday Review, but mainly in two journals that were among those at the center of American intellectual life of the period, The Nation, where she wrote book reviews and literary criticism, and The Partisan Review, to which she contributed essays. Her writing bears out her interest in the relationship between esthetics, morality and society and her determination to express moral judgments -- her critics said moralistic judgments -- on literature and the political issues of the day.         She was a fierce anti-Communist, someone who joined some Communist-front groups in the early 1930's but who then became disaffected by the ruthlessness of Stalin, and for the rest of her public life she wore the ideals of Western democracy on her sleeve. Perhaps it was this disaffection that led her to think of herself as a rationalist bent on exposing empty slogans and ideas -- political, literary and cultural. And it was this stance, the immovable anti-Communist who insisted that all ideas be grounded in rationality and morality, that dominated her work.         'An Anxious World' Filled With Fears         A native New Yorker, she was born on July 21, 1905, one of three children of Helene Forbert Rubin and Joseph Rubin, a manufacturer of straw braid. Her parents were immigrant Polish Jews who moved with their children from Westchester to Brooklyn to Manhattan. ''Pleasure was not the principle of our home,'' Mrs. Trilling once wrote. ''I learned early in life that to laugh before breakfast was to cry before dinner.''         She described herself as an ''excessively fearful'' child. First she was afraid of the dark, then of burglars and, as she grew older, eventually of just about everything, especially being alone or leaving the house. ''I regard the whole of my life as having been lived in an anxious world,'' she said.         Her fears, indeed her fear of having so many fears, may have shaped her choice of work, she came to believe, because they made her ''too intent upon reasonableness'' and ''blocked the free play of my imagination.'' Thus she stuck to analytical writing, preferring the logical and cerebral to the fantastic.         In 1927, in a Manhattan speak-easy -- over a drink called a bullfrog (gin, apricot brandy and grenadine) -- she met Lionel Trilling. He was smart and handsome, a graduate student in literature at Columbia. In a short time, they fell in love. Later they slept together. (''Surely going to bed with a man before marriage was the most courageous act of my life,'' she said.) And in 1929, they were married.         ''With marriage I had entered Lionel's world,'' she said. ''It was with his friends that I now chiefly associated. They were not easy companions, these intellectuals. They were overbearing and arrogant, excessively competitive; they lacked magnanimity and often they lacked common courtesy. Ours was a cruelly judgmental society, often malicious and riddled with envy.''         But what a society it was, with Alfred Kazin, Irving Howe, Philip Rahv, William Phillips, Sidney Hook, Delmore Schwartz, Dwight McDonald, Hannah Arendt, Saul Bellow, Mary McCarthy, Clement Greenberg, Irving Kristol and several others striving to set the intellectual agenda of the nation.         In book-cluttered apartments on the Upper West Side, they lived what Mrs. Trilling called ''a life of significant contention.'' In the pages of The Partisan Review, Commentary, The Nation and Dissent, they debated whether America should enter World War II. They quarreled over Trotsky and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the Beats and the Columbia riots to such an extent that many of the survivors have not spoken to one another for years.         When these intellectuals were not preoccupied by ideas or pulling apart the culture, they talked incessantly, Mrs. Trilling remembered in her memoir, ''about sex, sex, and more sex, with particular emphasis upon adultery.'' Sex, she continued, ''took up as much conversational space as in later years we would give to politics.''         Wielding Her Pen With Candor         Diana Trilling's career as a critic began in 1941, at the age of 36, when she overheard a telephone conversation between her husband and Margaret Marshall, the literary editor of The Nation, who had called to ask if he could recommend someone to write the magazine's literary notes column. When her husband hung up, Mrs. Trilling looked at him and offered herself for the position.         She held the job for 10 years, often wielding her pen like a Bowie knife: ''A mad, bad, and dangerous book, Allan Seager's 'Equinox' is fiction's most recent attempt to practice psychiatry without a license.'' Or, of Truman Capote's ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'': ''I find myself deeply antipathetic to the whole artistic-moral purpose of Mr. Capote's novel. I would freely trade 80 percent of his technical skill for 20 percent more value in the uses to which it is put.''         She was proud of her reputation as a clear-eyed, uncompromising critic. She liked to tell the story of a Viennese novelist, a refugee from Nazi Austria, who ''was said to have remarked that he had lost his country, his home, his language, but that he had at least one good fortune; he has not been reviewed by me.''         As she approached her 42d birthday, she decided that she and her husband had been squandering their lives. ''We were afraid to be full grown up and to be in command of ourselves and others.'' And so she became pregnant. Their only child, James, was born shortly thereafter, in 1947. James, of Providence, R.I., survives her, as do two grandchildren.         In 1975, Lionel Trilling died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 70, and in the years that followed, she worked hard to assure his legacy, editing a 12-volume uniform edition of his work. But she also strove successfully to establish her own mark, writing essays, publishing two collections of criticism -- ''Reviewing the Forties''  and ''We Must My Darlings'' (Harcourt Brace, 1977) -- and covering the Jean Harris trial. Then, suffering from macular degeneration that left her with eyesight so poor she could no longer type, she dictated her memoir, ''The Beginning of the Journey.''         To the last, she remained contentious, complaining of America's loss of intellectual culture. ''I think the life of significant contention no longer exists,'' she told New York magazine in 1995. ''We have enormous division in our society on sectarian or ideological lines. But we don't have any discourse.'' She said that the best academic minds had drifted into esoteric specialization and she assailed multiculturalism as ''our present-day version of Stalinism -- a culture of moral virtue without thought.''         Earlier this year The New Yorker published her brief memoir of her days at summer camp, and she finished her last book, ''A Visit to Camelot,'' an account of an evening spent at the White House when John F. Kennedy was President.         Three or four times a week in her later years, friends would come to the cluttered apartment to read to her. Among them was the poet Richard Howard, who said that despite her infirmities, she remained ''remarkably autonomous.''         Often the conversation turned to Lionel Trilling. ''Seventeen years have now passed since Lionel's death,'' she wrote at the conclusion of her memoir, ''and hour by hour, minute by minute I still listen for a clock which no longer ticks.''         Correction:  October 31, 1996, Thursday         An obituary of the critic and writer Diana Trilling on Friday omitted part of the title of a collection of her essays. It is ''We Must March My Darlings.''       
         Marion Durham Cuyjet, a pioneering teacher of black dancers, died on Oct. 22 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. Mrs. Cuyjet was 76 and lived in Philadelphia.         She had been suffering from cardiopulmonary disorders, according to her son, Stephen Cuyjet Jr.         Mrs. Cuyjet's most famous pupil was Judith Jamison, artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Ms. Jamison began training in ballet at the age of 6 with ''Miss Marion,'' as everyone called Mrs. Cuyjet (pronounced soo-zhay).         In addition to teaching classical ballet and other dance techniques,  Mrs. Cuyjet taught her students that ''dancers were not hybrid creatures dropped down from the clouds with no relation to earth,'' as Ms. Jamison noted in her autobiography, ''Dancing Spirit.''         Mrs. Cuyjet also provided subliminal lessons in determination and race relations. ''She looked Caucasian and rented studio space that landlords would not rent to a person they thought was black,'' Ms. Jamison wrote. ''She broke the color barrier and was constantly evicted once black children were discovered on the premises; she had to move her school seven times.''         Born in Cheswold, Del., Mrs. Cuyjet studied ballet in Philadelphia with Essie Marie Dorsey, herself a student of Michel Fokine and Mikhail Mordkin, and opened the Judimar School in 1948. Mrs. Cuyjet created dances for public events in the city, and in the late 1950's was the principal choreographer for the annual Christmas Cotillion sponsored by Heritage House, a leading black cultural organization in Philadelphia.         From 1958 into the 1970's, Mrs. Cuyjet was on the dance faculty at Maryland State College (now the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore) and also taught at Delaware State College in Dover, and Cheney State University in Cheney, Pa. She closed her studio in 1971 and trained as a movement therapist, working at the Philadelphia State Hospital for 11 years. She was also a dance panelist on the Pennsylvania State Arts Council.         Mrs. Cuyjet's husband, Stephen, died in 1980. In addition to her son, Stephen Jr., of San Diego, she is survived by a daughter, Judith Coldvin, of Marlton, N.J.; a son, Mark, of Philadelphia; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Hermine Baron, one of America's top-ranked female bridge players, died in Los Angeles on Sept. 27. She was 83 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her former husband, Arthur Baron of Los Angeles.         For the last 22 years, Mrs. Baron had more master points than any other female player, ending with 22,645 and the title of grand life master. From 1975 to 1983, she was ranked second among all players by the American Contract Bridge League, and was 10th when she died.         In 1964 and 1970, she won the McKenney Trophy, awarded for winning the most points in a calendar year.In 1964, she set a points record.         Mrs. Baron was a member of the United States Women's Team that took third place in the 1968 world championships in Deauville, France, and she competed in the World Women's Pairs Championship in 1978 and 1982. In national competition, she won the Life Master Pairs in 1966 and five other titles: the Women's Teams in 1964 and 1968; the Women's Pairs in 1968 and 1982, and the Life Master Women's Pairs in 1963. She finished second seven times.         Mrs. Baron was born in Omaha and stricken with polio at the age of 13, after which she was confined to a wheelchair.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Jerry Hirschman of Chicago.       
         Barbara C. Salken, a professor at the Pace University School of Law in White Plains, died on Oct. 17 at Westchester Medical Center in Valhalla. She was 49 and lived in Chappaqua, N.Y.         She suffered a long illness, according to the law school, where she had taught criminal law and procedure for 13 years. For three of the last seven years, she was voted the outstanding professor of the year by the graduating class, most recently at the 1996 commencement.         Professor Salken, who was a native of Richmond and a graduate of Skidmore College and Brooklyn Law School, first practiced with the Legal Aid Society in New York City. She was associated with its criminal defense division and then with the special litigation unit, where she supervised law-reform work and class-action litigation, taking part in cases that dealt with the treatment of youthful criminal offenders.         As an active member of the Association of the Bar of New York City, she served on its council on criminal justice and as chairwoman of the committee on criminal justice.         Professor Salken is survived by her husband, Matthew Rosen; a son, Billy; a sister, Judy Salken of Mahopac, N.Y., and her parents, Doris and Irvin Salken of Williamsburg, Va.       
         Ruth Waxman, who played a prominent role in Conservative Judaism, died on Oct. 18 at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 80.         She had suffered injuries in a fall at her home in Great Neck, L.I., earlier that week, her family said.         Mrs. Waxman was the wife of Rabbi Mordecai Waxman of Temple Israel in Great Neck. An early advocate of women's rights in Conservative Judaism, she lectured widely on the role of women in the synagogue.         From 1972 until two years ago, she was an editor of Judaism: A Quarterly Journal of Jewish Life and Thought, published by the American Jewish Congress.         She was born in Palestine and brought as a child to the United States, where her family settled in Chicago. She graduated from the University of Chicago, from which she also received a doctorate in comparative literature. She taught literature there and at Adelphi University, at the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University and, most recently, at the State University at Stony Brook, L.I., and at Queens College.         Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, Rabbi Jonothan Waxman of Eberon, N.J., and David and Hillel Waxman of Great Neck; a brother, Rabbi Albert Bilgray of Tucson, Ariz., and five grandchildren.       
         Miriam Kressyn, a star of the Yiddish stage and, along with her husband, Seymour Rechtzeit, a primary force in the survival of Yiddish theater in the United States, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         As actress, singer, adapter of plays, radio personality and teacher, Ms. Kressyn was one of the most popular artists in the Yiddish-speaking theater, brightening musicals as well as plays over a period of 60 years. Although she had diverse talents, she was best known for portraying stately, ladylike characters.         She was born in Bialystok, in what is now Poland, and came to the United States in 1925. While living in Boston, she began singing on radio, then switched to the stage, singing in the chorus of a Yiddish theater. Soon she was acting, playing male and female roles. She studied at the New England Conservatory of Music and Northeastern University.         Subsequently she acted in Chicago and Philadelphia (where she met her husband), and toured Europe, South America and Africa before settling in New York. She quickly became a favorite of local audiences drawn to theaters on lower Second Avenue by stories of sentiment, nostalgia and sometimes tragedy.         For five years, she and her husband acted in musical comedies with Menasha Skulnick. She was also in I. J. Singer's ''Brothers Askenazi'' and ''Yoshe Kalb'' and in Isaac Bashevis Singer's ''Family Muskat,'' and played the title role in an adaptation of Philip Yordan's ''Anna Lucasta.''         She and her husband became known as the romantic idols of Yiddish musicals. Often she was featured in a cast with other Yiddish theater favorites, including Reizl Bozyk, Ben Bonus, Leo Fuchs, Mina Bern and Jacob Jacobs.         In reviewing the musical ''A Cowboy in Israel'' in The New York Times, Richard F. Shepard said that the actress, ''rising to the occasion as usual, plays the tsoriss-ridden heroine -- no laughs, all trouble -- who stands to inherit a fortune if only she marries.''         Eventually Ms. Kressyn began adapting plays, including ''The Flowering Peach'' by Clifford Odets, Leon Kobrin's ''Riverside Drive'' and Nahum Stutchkoff's ''Land of Dreams.'' She taught Yiddish theater at Queens College, and for 40 years she and her husband broadcast in Yiddish on WEVD radio. In 1937 she appeared in Joseph Green's Yiddish film ''Der Purimshpieler.''         Several times in her career there were suggestions that she might perform in English on Broadway (in ''The Diary of Anne Frank'') and in English-language films, but she remained in the Yiddish theater for her entire life. To the repeated charge that Yiddish theater was defunct, she would say, with characteristic enthusiasm, ''We are not dead, we are very much alive.'' Summing up her career, she said, with pride, ''Yiddish is my world.''         She is survived by her husband, who is president of the Hebrew Actors Union.       
         Angela Romano Perez, an advocate for the disabled whose life was a model of the personal independence, responsibility and achievement she championed, died on Friday at the Cabrini Hospice in the Gramercy Park area of Manhattan. Ms. Perez, a lifelong resident of the Upper East Side, was 49.         Her husband, Joseph, said the cause was breast cancer.         Ms. Perez, who was born with cerebral palsy, spent her life trying to change the prejudices that disabled people often encounter or even impose on themselves.         At her death, she was the program director of the Y.W.C.A. of New York City, for which she directed the Networking Project for People With Disabilities. ''The project was founded to provide young people with disabilities with positive role models because, particularly for young women with disabilities, there tends to be a lack of visible, appealing role models,'' said Madeline F. Beusse, a consultant who worked with Ms. Perez on the financing of the project. ''The project is about empowerment, boosting self-esteem and opening doors.''         Besides leading the Networking Project, which is paid for by the city's Youth Services Department and private donations, Ms. Perez designed and oversaw a study of the accessibility of health services for disabled women. Called ''Breaking Down Barriers: Eliminating Obstacles to Reproductive Health Care for Women With Disabilities'' and financed by the New York State Department of Health, the study is continuing. The findings and recommendations are to be presented by its board -- health care professionals, disability advocates and corporate and public officials -- at a conference in the spring.         Before taking the Y.W.C.A. post in 1988, Ms. Perez was the educational counseling coordinator for the Mayor's Office for People With Disabilities, from 1983 to 1987.         Working to raise awareness of domestic violence against people with disabilities, she served on Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani's task force on domestic violence, giving a voice to some of the more vulnerable victims of abuse.         Ms. Perez was also on the board of directors of the Center for the Independence of the Disabled and a vice president of Women With Disabilities, both of which are advocacy and service organizations.         Combining advocacy with her love of travel, Ms. Perez attended the nongovernmental forum on women held in Beijing in conjunction with the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women last year. She went frequently to Canada to collaborate with the Disabled Women's Networ, and traveled as well to Japan, Thailand, Austria, Britain and Italy and throughout the United States.         On Oct. 5, her birthday, a personal letter of commendation from Hillary Rodham Clinton was delivered to Ms. Perez's room at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, where she had been under care since August. It was followed by a letter from the Mayor, commending Ms. Perez for the difference she had made in the life of New Yorkers.         Ms. Perez held two degrees from Hunter College: a Bachelor of Arts in psychology, awarded in 1978, and a Master of Science in education, awarded in 1983.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Stephen and Mary Romano, and her brother, Benjamin, all of Manhattan.       
         Marjorie Shostak, a woman from a traditional family in Flatbush whose book about a bold older woman from the !Kung San tribe in Africa's Kalahari Desert rode an early wave of women's studies and injected new life into techniques of anthropology, died on Sunday at DeKalb Medical Center in Atlanta. She was 51.         The cause was breast cancer, family members said.         Ms. Shostak relayed her findings in a 1981 book, ''Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman'' (Harvard University Press), illustrated with her photographs. The book revealed the world of a 50-ish !Kung San woman who says, for example, speaking of sex in old age, ''Then I'll wear the beads and powder and I'll be beautiful again, so beautiful that the men will say, 'Nisa, aren't you a lovely one.' ''         The book, which is frequently used as a text in women's studies and anthropology classes, portrayed Nisa, a name that Ms. Shostak invented to protect the privacy of the subject, as a vibrant, piercing, blunt, frank desert woman who would discuss sex, men, jealousy and women's anatomy as casually as a woman in Flatbush might discuss a grocery list.         The encounter between Nisa and the author took place during Ms. Shostak's initial field work from 1968 to 1971, when she was 21 and had just married her Brooklyn College sweetheart. Nisa was about 30 years older.         Despite the contrast between their social backgrounds, author and subject managed to share emotions and to bridge the gulf of geography and social background, said Ms. Shostak's husband, Dr. Melvin Konner, who is the Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Anthropology and an associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at Emory University.         Nisa's life, as described by Ms. Shostak, was one through which readers came to understand that !Kung San were open and direct in ways that amazed Westerners.         ''It was a life that we can recognize emotionally,'' said Brenda Bynum, an associate of Ms. Shostak.         The language of the !Kung San involves a number of click sounds that others find difficult to speak, let alone learn. (The exclamation point, in Western depictions of the language, is used to represent the click sound.) Yet Ms. Shostak was able to learn it by pointing to objects and asking women to talk about them. Learning from women as she sat under trees or in grass huts, Ms. Shostak quickly reached a level of mastery that allowed her to conduct the hours of interviews with Nisa and other women about their lives.         Ms. Shostak wrote the book while she and her husband lived in Cambridge, Mass., where she was an associate of the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.         Beginning in 1983, both were associated with Emory University, where she was an adjunct assistant professor of anthropology.         In 1993, Ms. Shostak, part way through an eight-year battle with breast cancer and believing that it would be her last chance to see Nisa, spent weeks searching for her in the deserts and, remarkably, found her. The story was recorded in a second book, ''Nisa Revisited,'' that Ms. Shostak had largely completed before she died, Dr. Konner said.         Ms. Shostak lacked training in anthropology -- she earned a bachelor's degree in literature at Brooklyn College -- but her work was the subject of a number of doctoral studies in that field, and although she wrote few academic works, her field work was often analyzed at academic conferences, her husband said.         She is survived by her husband, two daughters, Susanna B. Konner and Sarah B. Konner, and a son, Adam J. Konner, all of Atlanta; her parents, Jerome and Edna Shostak of Midwood, Brooklyn, and Palm Beach, Fla., and a sister, Lucy Shostak of Baldwin, L.I.       
         Diane Dickerson Montgomery, a former psychiatric social worker and bank officer who was involved in civil rights causes since childhood, died on Sunday at her home in Chicago. She was 62 and also had homes in Lubec, Me., and Key West, Fla.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Charles H. Montgomery.         A graduate of the Francis Parker School in Chicago and Mills College in Oakland, Calif., she earned a master's degree in social work at the University of Chicago and went to work for several public and private agencies. She later joined the First National Bank of Chicago as an officer in the trust department.         Her early advocacy of racial equality was inspired by her father, Earl B. Dickerson, a prominent Chicago civil-rights lawyer and 30-year board member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Mr. Dickerson, who won major legal battles involving housing segregation in Chicago, took her along as a child when he visited whites-only restaurants, was refused service and sued their owners.         Later, barred from the dining room of a major Chicago hotel, she asked her father's advice. ''Sue,'' he said. She did, and won.         Mr. Dickerson died in 1986.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Stephen Brown of Oak Park, Ill., and Joshua Cohen of Chicago; a daughter, Judith Cohen Brown of Seattle; a stepdaughter, Alison Montgomery of Chicago; a stepson, Douglas Montgomery of Libertyville, Ill., and two grandchildren.       
         Jessie Bernard, a sociologist whose wide-ranging research and writings on women's issues provided scholarly foundation for the modern feminist revolution, died on Oct. 6 at a nursing home in Washington. She was 93.         By rights, Dr. Bernard should have been content to observe the reawakening of feminism benignly from the far side of a long and completed career.         Indeed, when Betty Friedan revived feminist fervor with the publication of her landmark ''Feminine Mystique'' in 1963, Dr. Bernard was a 60-year-old Penn State professor a year away from retirement. And, with the exception of ''Academic Women,'' a 1961 work derived from her own experiences in academia, the dozen or so works on subjects like community organization that had gained her reputation as a respected scholar seemed remote from the suddenly urgent issues raised by the Friedan treatise.         But like many professional women of a certain age who had balanced a successful career with marriage and motherhood, Dr. Bernard came to the realization that she had been a feminist all along and, as it turned out, had a lot to say on the subject.         So much so, in fact, that within a decade after her formal retirement in 1964 she had turned out a torrent of books -- among them ''The Sex Game,'' ''The Female World,'' ''The Future of Marriage'' and ''The Future of Motherhood'' -- that established her as a premier scholar of the women's movement.         It is in part a tribute to her scholarship that many of the ideas she advanced, like the notion that marriage generally benefits men more than women, seem commonplace today.         Although her works were based on meticulous research, as a feminist scholar Dr. Bernard had an edge. For when it came to writing about women as wives, mothers and breadwinners, she had not only been there and done that, she had also done it with uncommon flair.         On the surface, she had led the most conventional of lives. The daughter of immigrant shopkeepers from Romania, Dr. Bernard, whose original name was Ravitch, was born in Minneapolis, attended the University of Minnesota, married her college sweetheart and followed her husband from job to job, serving variously as his assistant and collaborator while holding a series of lower-level jobs, and not beginning her own academic career in earnest until she was in her 40's, an age when a woman's children are generally old enough to fend for themselves.         But surfaces can be deceiving, and there was very little conventional about Dr. Bernard.         For one thing, the college sweetheart she married was not a classmate, but one of her professors, Dr. Luther Lee Bernard, a founder of the modern study of sociology and a man more than twice her age when they met in a classroom and felt such a powerful mutual attraction that neither looked back.         She then accelerated her education, graduating at 20 and receiving a master's degree the next year. After marrying her professor she began a peripatetic life, following him band from academic post to post, including a sojourn to Argentina, where she helped him with the research that would win him wide acclaim.         Dr. Bernard did not obtain her own doctorate, from Washington University in St. Louis, until she was 32, and did not begin her teaching career, at the Lindewood College for Women, near St. Louis, until she was 37.         Then, at a time when many women's children are beginning to leave home, Dr. Bernard started having children, the first when she was 39, another when she was 42 and the last when she was 47, three years after she and her husband had joined the Penn State faculty and six months before his death at the age of 69.         By the time she retired from Penn State and began writing about women's issues, Dr. Bernard knew what it meant to be both a wife and a single mother.         She moved her family to Washington and became a central figure in the feminist revolution, studying subtle forms of sex discrimination as scholar in residence for the United States Commission on Civil Rights, for example, and becoming a founding board member for the Center for Women in Policy Studies.         In her later years Dr. Bernard, who was known for her beaming smile and generosity in helping younger scholars, exerted a magnetic attraction at conferences and other gatherings, her colleagues at the center said, and was regarded by some scholars as a founding mother of sociology.         Dr. Bernard is survived by a daughter, Dorothy Jackson of Washington; two sons, Claude, of Laurel, Md., and David, of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.       
         Former Representative Coya Knutson of Minnesota, a fierce champion of family farms, medical research and campaign finance reform and the creator of Federal student loans, died at a nursing home in Edina, Minn., on Thursday, her legislative achievements all but overshadowed by her vindictive husband's ''Coya, Come Home'' campaign that led to her defeat after two terms in 1958. She was 82.         Her son, Terry, said the cause was kidney failure.         If there had ever been any doubts that a woman's place is in the House, they must surely have been dispelled in 1954 when the former Coya Gjesdal unseated a six-term Republican and swept into Congress like a whirlwind from northern Minnesota.         There had been women in Congress continuously for more than 30 years, and Mrs. Knutson, although the first from Minnesota, was one of seven elected in 1954. But it is safe to say that the House had never seen anything quite like her.         A Norwegian immigrant's daughter who grew up on a North Dakota farm, graduated from Concordia College in 1934 and spent a year studying voice and piano at the Juilliard School before returning to North Dakota to teach school, she married in 1940 and settled in the little town of Oklee, Minn., just across the state line.         She and her husband operated a small hotel cum cafe until Mrs. Knutson, a populist inspired by Eleanor Roosevelt, got the political bug and made a successful run for the Minnesota Legislature in 1950.         A tireless campaigner who accompanied herself on the accordion while singing her own campaign song in a lilting soprano, she stunned the Minnesota political establishment when she won the 1954 Congressional election, and when she got to Washington she stunned Congress even more.         Despite her lack of seniority, Mrs. Knutson promptly won a place on the House Agriculture Committee. She subsequently initiated the first Federal appropriations for cystic fibrosis research, introduced the first bill calling for the income tax checkoff to finance Presidential election campaigns and originated the idea and the legislation that established the Federal student loan program.         Mrs. Knutson was an independent-minded woman, and she made her share of political enemies along the way. But, despite opposition from some leaders of her own Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, she appeared headed for a long and brilliant career in Congress as her second term drew to a close.         Then, in May 1958, when her party declined to formally endorse Mrs. Knutson for a third term, forcing her to run in a primary to seek re-election, Andy Knutson, the farmhand she had married 18 years earlier, dropped a bombshell.         In an open letter to his wife, he urged her to leave Congress and return to what he described as the ''happy home we once enjoyed.''         Never mind that Mr. Knutson, who had once worked on her father's farm in North Dakota, had not shared a bedroom with his wife for years or that he had regularly beaten her so badly during her visits to Minnesota, as their son later recalled it, that she had to wear dark glasses to hide her black eyes from her fellow members of Congress.         Once the resulting ''Coya, Come Home,'' newspaper headline was carried across the country, it created a firestorm of publicity that accepted Mr. Knutson's story as the plaintive truth and portrayed his wife as an uncaring wife who had abandoned her family for political ambition.         Mr. Knutson later stirred the fire by accusing his wife of having an affair with a legislative aide half her age, but although the charge was a blatant fabrication, Mrs. Knutson refused to denounce her husband.         She managed to win the primary, but lost the general election by 1,390 votes to Odin Langen, a Republican who was 6 feet 4 inches tall and campaigned on the slogan, ''A Big Man for a Man-Sized Job.'' There was never any doubt that the ''Coya, Come Home,'' campaign had cost Mrs. Knutson the election, and as it turned out, her political career.         She failed in a comeback bid in 1960, divorced her husband in 1962, and then spent a dozen years working in the Defense Department in Washington before trying another abortive race in 1977, polling 13 percent of the vote in a primary in which one of her opponents was her former legislative aide.         According to her son, who was adopted when he was 8 over the objections of his father, Mrs. Knutson, a deeply religious woman who frequently cited the biblical passage, ''Vengeance is Mine, sayeth the Lord,'' never expressed bitterness toward her husband.         But she was also apparently content to leave forgiveness to the Lord. When Mr. Knutson died of acute alcohol poisoning in 1969, she did not attend his funeral.         Besides her son, of Bloomington, Minn., Mrs. Knutson is survived by two sisters, Helen Riets of Devil's Lake, N.D., and Crystal Greguson of Edina, two grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Ruth Diebold, a librarian who combined her professional interests with a personal dedication to culinary pursuits and so helped to preserve the legacy of James Beard, apostle of American cookery, died on Tuesday at her home in Upper Nyack, N.Y. She was 77.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         At her death Mrs. Diebold was vice president of the Nyack Library. She also was a former director. After Mr. Beard died in 1985, she volunteered to turn his Greenwich Village town house into a center for culinary arts.         She was a graduate of the University of Chicago and obtained a master's degree in library science from Columbia University.         She is survived by her husband, William Diebold; four sons, David Corcoran of Northvale, N.J., John Corcoran of Red Hook, N.Y.; John Diebold of Nyack, and William Diebold of Portland, Ore.; a daughter, Barbara Wick of Northfield, Ill.; a brother, Joseph Brody of Indianapolis; 11 grandchildren, and 2 great-grandchildren.       
         Irma Ullmann, the matriarch of a New York philanthropic family, died on Nov. 4 at White Plains Hospital while staying with family in Rye Brook, N.Y. She was 91 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla., since moving from Manhattan more than 30 years ago.         Working through the Ullmann Family Foundation, she carried on the work she began with her husband, Siegfried Ullmann, a Wall Street commodities trader, supporting educational and medical institutions here and in Israel. Centers and projects they sponsored in both countries bear their name.         Among the chief beneficiaries were Yeshiva University and its Albert Einstein College of Medicine, where she was a board member of the national women's division. The Ullmanns established the college's Research Center for Health Sciences and a chair in molecular genetics.         At the American Society for Technion-Israel Institute of Technology, she was a principal supporter of scientific and technological research at the institute in Haifa. The Ullman Teaching Center serves undergraduates and Technion's 19 faculty departments, and family funds sustained an Ullmann Robotics Center, along with scholarships, dormitories and laboratories.         The Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel was a beneficiary from its beginning, and she left her stamp on its Ullmann Institute of Life Sciences, the Ullmann Gallery at Weizmann, to which she contributed art from her private collection, and an Ullmann Professorial Chair.         Other major recipients included UJA-Federation of New York and the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. The Lichtenstadter Hospital for the Chronically Ill in Israel was established in memory of her parents, Jakob and Flora Lichtenstadter.         Mrs. Ullmann is survived by a son, Dr. Leonard P. Ullmann of Incline Village, Nev., five grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Her husband of 40 years, Siegfried, a founder and former president of the international metals and commodities trading firm of Philipp Brothers, died in 1966.       
         Dorothy Bird, an early Martha Graham dancer who also appeared on Broadway and became a noted Graham teacher, died on Tuesday at the home of her son, Casey Villard, in Etna, N.H. She was 84.         Born on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Miss Bird was a shy,  impressionable teen-ager with a vivid imagination when she made her way to the Cornish School in Seattle in 1930 to study with Graham, who was then just making her name as a modern-dance choreographer. Charmed by Graham and her unorthodox, impassioned approach to teaching dance, Miss Bird followed her to New York to study with her at the Neighborhood Playhouse and joined the Graham company in 1931.         She made her debut in ''Primitive Mysteries'' and performed small roles in such dances as ''Panorama'' and ''Chronicles'' in her six years with the group. She also demonstrated classroom exercises for Graham, but eventually realized that she was not going to become a leading Graham performer.         She had also began to feel ''enslaved,'' as she later put it, by the demanding Graham. She broke with her in 1937, moving on that year to Broadway, where she performed for 10 years in musicals including ''Lady in the Dark.''         Miss Bird also performed at resorts in the Catskills and with modern-dance groups that included the Limon Trio, dancing with Jose Limon and Beatrice Seckler through 1947. She taught modern dance for 25  years at such places as the Neighborhood Playhouse, the School of American Ballet and the 92d Street Y  and was a master teacher at New York University and other colleges in and around New York.         A witty anecdotalist and shrewd observer of modern-dance history, Miss Bird had been at work on her autobiography with a friend, Joyce  Greenberg. The book, ''A Bird's Eye View,'' will be published next year by the University of Pittsburgh Press.         Miss Bird's husband, Paul Villard, died in 1994.         In addition to her son, she is survived by three grandchildren.       
         Ruth E. Moskowitz of Brooklyn, a justice of the New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, died on Nov. 2 at Mount Sinai Medical Center. A native and lifetime resident of Brooklyn Heights, she was 60.         Her family said the cause was scleroderma, a rheumatological disorder.         Judge Moskowitz first won election to the State Supreme Court in 1982 and was assigned to Criminal Term, Kings County. She was re-elected posthumously this month to a second 14-year term.         She received a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's from the University of Connecticut, then joined the civil rights movement in the summer of 1961. On a mission to integrate a Jackson, Miss., lunch counter, she was arrested and charged with trespassing.         While in solitary confinement in a Mississippi state prison, she made a decision to go into law. She graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1964 and went to work for the Legal Aid Society. She was in private practice when she first ran for Civil Court in 1976.         Over the years, she presided over many cases of Medicaid fraud and official corruption. In 1988, one of her cases produced a memorable encounter with Mayor Edward I. Koch.  At issue was the forbearance she had shown to a score of former parking-meter collectors who had pocketed thousands of dollars. Because they had no prior records, she had accepted their guilty pleas and given them sentences that involved no jail time, fines or restitution. Mayor Koch was moved to appear in person to support the demand for such penalties by the Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman.         The judge scolded the Mayor for his trouble, pointing out that he was lavishing his attention on a case involving ''little people.'' She also faulted what she called the administration's sloppy supervision.         Yes, she told the Mayor, little people become malefactors, too, but they have rights. She added that the defendants ''are going to be treated just the way the big boys are being treated,'' alluding to politically connected officials involved in recent corruption scandals. She declined to amend her decision.         Justice Moskowitz served on professional panels, in the Office of Court Administration and the New York Task Force on Women in the Courts.         She is survived by her husband, Martin Gershon; a daughter, Leah, and two sons, Joel and Robert, all of Brooklyn Heights; a sister, Anne Lyons of Manhattan, and her mother, Gussie Moskowitz, also of Brooklyn.       
         Alma Kitchell, a pioneering radio singer who became a pioneering talk show host, sang in the first televised opera and capped her career by presiding over the first television cooking show, died on Wednesday at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 103.         She was known as the Golden Voice of the Golden Age of radio, and from the time she walked into NBC's old New York station, WJZ, in 1927 and sang her way into a job, her rich contralto was rarely silent for the next two decades.         After singing regularly on the local station for a year, she moved up to NBC's old Blue network, spending two years with the NBC Opera Company and five years as the soloist on a weekly program with the NBC concert orchestra before increasing her schedule to three nights a week for a seven-year run.         By the time she abandoned broadcast singing in 1940, Miss Kitchell had embarked on a new phase of her vocal career, as the originator and host of a series of talk shows devoted to women's concerns. Her program and Mary Margaret McBride's, which ran on NBC's Red network, are regarded as the first radio talk shows.         Under names like ''Let's Talk It Over,'' ''Women's Exchange,'' and ''Alma Kitchell's Brief Case,'' in which she answered her voluminous mail, the programs were broadcast from 1938 to 1947, initially on NBC and later on ABC, the network organized in 1943 to take over NBC's Blue network.         Along the way, Miss Kitchell interviewed prominent women like Eleanor Roosevelt, discussed family and social issues and chatted about her own active life.         For all the fans she acquired as a singer, Miss Kitchell became even more famous as a talk show host, and she put her celebrity to civic use, especially during World War II. She once sang on the air while giving blood, for example, and she conceived of and popularized the slogan ''A Stamp a Day for the Man Who's Away'' to help sell war bonds.         A formidable woman on or off the air, Miss Kitchell, who had been sent on cross-country speaking tours by NBC to promote radio, became an important fund-raiser for the Republican Party in New York and was named to state commissions by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey.         A native of Superior, Wis., Miss Kitchell, whose maiden name was Hopkins, began singing locally. She studied at the Cincinnati Conservatory and came to New York in 1912 at the age of 19 to pursue a professional career.         According to family legend, she was chaperoned by her mother during her first year in New York, spent the second year on her own and in the third married her voice teacher, Charles W. Kitchell.         She began by singing with major local choral societies and orchestras, and made her debut at Town Hall in 1924 in a program that included Bach and Handel airs, Swiss and Jewish folksongs and modern French, German and Russian songs with American lyrics.         By the time she began her radio career in 1927, Miss Kitchell had already established her credentials as a broadcast pioneer. In 1917, six years before regular broadcasts were begun, she sang for an experimental station established at the base of the Statue of Liberty.         For all her devotion to music, Miss Kitchell came to love radio more. In 1937, she turned down an opportunity to join the Metropolitan Opera in order to stay in broadcasting.         Although she was primarily known for her work in radio, Miss Kitchell was a pioneer in television as well. In 1939, when RCA began the first experimental television broadcasts from its Rockefeller Center headquarters, she sang the part of Ruth, the piratical maid of all work, in the first televised opera, Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance.''         Eight years later, at the dawn of network television in 1947, Miss Kitchell abandoned her radio career and ABC to return to NBC and make television history once again, this time as the star of the first commercial network television series, also  television's first cooking show, ''In the Kelvinator Kitchen.''         She remained on the program until 1949, then retired from public life.         Miss Kitchell, whose first husband died in 1956, married Joseph Yoder, a retired chemical engineer, in 1965 and settled in Florida. Mr. Yoder died about a decade ago.         Miss Kitchell remained in vigorous health until her 100th birthday. It was an occasion noted by Willard Scott, the ''Today'' weatherman, from NBC's studios in the same building where she had helped open the television era a half-century earlier.         She is survived by two sons,  Charles Kitchell of Osterville, Mass.,  and James Kitchell of Atlanta; four grandchildren, and four great-grandhildren.       
         Virginia Cherrill, a 1930's actress who starred as a beautiful, blind flower girl in the classic Charlie Chaplin silent film ''City Lights'' (1931), died late Thursday in a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 88 and had settled in Santa Barbara in 1950.         Miss Cherrill was born near Carthage, Ill. and educated at schools in Kenosha, Wis., and Chicago.         After an early marriage to Irving Adler, a Chicago lawyer, ended in divorce, she went to California to recover and met Chaplin there. He has variously been said to have first noticed her on a California beach and when they were both at a boxing match.         David Robinson, film critic for The Times of London, wrote in a 1985 biography of Chaplin that the actor gave Miss Cherrill the part of the flower girl largely because she portrayed a blind person appealingly, in a test, after he advised her to look at him but ''to look inwardly and not to see me.''         In the movie, Chaplin starred opposite her as a little tramp who fell in love with her. Its final scene, with close-ups of Miss Cherrill, has won special praise. The writer and critic James Agee called it ''enough to shrivel the heart to see, the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies.''         Miss Cherrill starred in several other American-made movies in the early 1930's and met Cary Grant at a film premiere. They were married in 1933, and she went on to retire briefly from movie making.         Their divorce came in 1935. Then she resumed her career, again briefly, in Britain, where she acted in two films. Later she said, ''I was no great shakes as an actress.''         She retired from movie making for good when she began her nine-year marriage to the ninth Earl of Jersey, in 1937.         As the Countess of Jersey, she did charity work in Britain during World War II.         She is survived by her husband of 48 years, Florian Martini, a World War II flying ace.       
         Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a psychologist who defied conventional wisdom and greatly emboldened the fledgling gay rights movement in the 1950's by finding there was no measurable psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men, died on Monday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 89.         Dr. Hooker, who spent 30 years teaching at the University of California at Los Angeles, began studying homosexual men in the late 1940's, a period in which they were considered maladjusted -- at best -- and generally ignored or anathematized by the medical and mental health professions.         ''She never treated us like some strange tribe,'' recalled the writer Christopher Isherwood, who knew her at the time, ''so we told her things we never told anyone before.''         Her most significant work was a paper delivered in 1956 to the American Psychological Association in Chicago and published the next year as ''The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual'' in The Journal of Projective Techniques.         Dr. Hooker administered three standard personality tests, including the Rorschach ink-blot test, to two groups of 30 men, one heterosexual, one homosexual, who had been matched in I.Q.'s, age and education levels.         She then asked a panel of expert clinicians to assess the results without knowing the subjects' sexual orientation. To their surprise, the judges were unable to discern between the two groups on the basis of the test.         ''The most striking finding of the three judges,'' Dr. Hooker wrote, ''was that many of the homosexuals were very well adjusted. In fact, the three judges agreed on two-thirds of the group as being average to superior in adjustment. Not only do all homosexuals not have strong feminine identification, nor are they all 'somewhat paranoid,' but, according to the judges, some may not be characterized by any demonstrable pathology.''         Her study was criticized in many quarters, not least because it upended psychological orthodoxy. Among other objections was that she recruited her gay subjects through the assistance of ''homophile'' groups like the Mattachine Society, meaning that the men might be more content with their lives than the average homosexual and eager to prove that they were well adjusted.         Moreover, the study was published in a journal that did not reach a wide public audience. Nonetheless, it was considered a precursor to the decision 17 years later by the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its list of disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.         ''Her work in the 1950's really provided the framework within which the American Psychiatric Association could rethink its viewpoint,'' said Dr. Richard A. Isay, clinical professor of psychiatry at the Cornell University Medical College.         And 36 years after Dr. Hooker addressed the American Psychological Association, the organization gave her its award for distinguished contribution to psychology in the public interest, saying, ''This revolutionary study provided empirical evidence that normal homosexuals existed and supported the radical idea then emerging that homosexuality is within the normal range of human behavior.''         Evelyn Gentry was born in North Platte, Neb., in 1907 and grew up in northeastern Colorado. She earned her bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Colorado and her Ph.D., in 1932, from Johns Hopkins University.         Her exposure to the rise of Nazism while in Berlin on a fellowship in the late 1930's intensified her desire to make ''her life count in helping to correct social injustice,'' said a 1992 article in American Psychologist.         She joined the faculty at U.C.L.A. in 1939 and, outside of one year at Bryn Mawr, remained there until 1970. It was at U.C.L.A. in the 1940's that she befriended a gay student, Sam From, who introduced her in turn to his circle of friends. It was Mr. From who said, ''We have let you see us as we are, and now, it is your scientific duty to make a study of people like us.''         At the peak of the McCarthy period, in 1953, she applied for and received a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. ''They talk about all this courage I'm supposed to have had,'' she recalled four decades later, in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. ''I don't get that. Curiosity and empathy were what compelled me to do my study.''         In 1967, Dr. Hooker was appointed to head a study group on homosexuality for the National Institute of Mental Health. That panel recommended a repeal of sodomy laws and better public education about homosexuality.         After retiring from U.C.L.A., Dr. Hooker had a private practice until the late 1970's. She reviewed articles for professional journals and helped establish the Placek Fund of the American Psychological Foundation, which provides money for research into homosexuality.         She was also the subject of a 1992 documentary, ''Changing Our Minds: The Story of Dr. Evelyn Hooker,'' by David Haugland and Richard Schmiechen.         Her second husband, Edward Niles Hooker, died in 1957. She is survived by two sisters, Mildred Haugh, of Downey, Calif., and Myrtle Fisher, of Colorado.         In recent years, Dr. Hooker was frequently approached by strangers wanting to express their gratitude, such as a young woman who told her that she had been committed to a psychiatric hospital when her parents learned she was a lesbian.         ''The standard procedure for treating homosexuals in that hospital was electroshock therapy,'' Dr. Hooker recalled in the book ''Making History'' (HarperCollins, 1992) by Eric Marcus.         ''Her psychiatrist was familiar with my work and he was able to keep them from giving it to her. She had tears streaming down her face as she told me this. I know that wherever I go, there are men and women for whom my little bit of work and my caring enough to do it has made an enormous difference in their lives.''       
         Joan Paterson Kerr, a picture editor and author, died yesterday at her home in New Haven. She was 75.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Kerr was a founding picture editor of American Heritage magazine. She was a co-editor of ''American Album,'' published by American Heritage, and ''The Romantic Egoists,'' a pictorial history of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. She also was a picture editor at Newsweek Books and for the Book-of-the-Month Club series ''The American Past.''         Mrs. Kerr also compiled ''A Bully Father: Theodore Roosevelt's Letters to His Children'' (1995), for which she wrote the biographical essay and notes.         She is survived by her husband, Chester, former director of the Yale University Press; two daughters, Hilary Mills Loomis of Manhattan and Alley Mills Bean of Los Angeles; a son, Tony Mills of Oakland, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Louise Stack Duschl, a former artistic administrator for the Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, died on Wednesday at her home in Pittsburgh. She was 45.         The cause was cancer, said Patricia Wilde, artistic director of the ballet company.         Ms. Duschl began her professional career as a member of the dance faculty at Michigan State University, from 1974 to 1977.         She was the artistic director of Danceworks, the modern dance troupe of the Maryland National Capital Parks and Planning Commission, which performed throughout the region through 1981.         After the disbanding of the company, she worked in another administrative capacity with the commission before joining the Pittsburgh ballet company in 1989.         During her five years there, she helped to found an innovative dance therapy program.         She is survived by her husband, Richard, of Nashville; three daughters, Gretchen Hannah of Nashville and Cary Louise and Rebecca Aileen, both of Pittsburgh; her parents, Mr. and Mrs. Kenneth Stack of Hyattsville, Md.; two sisters, Judith Overman of Columbia, Md., and Carol Tilford of Fairfax, Va., and a brother, Kenneth Stack Jr. of Laurel, Md.       
         Elaine Anthony, a painter who specialized in lush semi-abstract landscapes, died on Oct. 26 at her home in West Redding, Conn. She was 53 years old.         The cause was cancer, her family said         Ms. Anthony was born in New York City, where her father, Jack Murray Anthony, was a cartoonist for The New Yorker and art director at Young & Rubicam. After earning an undergraduate degree from Stephens College in Columbia, Mo., she studied art at the Rhode Island School of Design.         In 1964, she married a Spanish architect, Pedro Sanchez de Move llan, and spent much of the next 20 years living in Mexico City, where her husband worked for the firm of Luis Barragan.         Ms. Anthony began her artistic career making wire sculptures, cloth banners and paintings on cloth, often executed as commissions for Mexican resorts. Her work matured to semi-abstract landscapes and collages, often executed in a loose painterly style.         She had her first Manhattan solo show in 1987, at the Stephen Haller Gallery in SoHo, and her first retrospective last winter, at the Neuberger Museum in Purchase, N.Y.         Exhibitions of her work are on view at the Tremaine Gallery at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., and the Stephen Haller Gallery.         Ms. Anthony's marriage ended in divorce in 1982. In 1991 she married Bernard Wharton.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her twin sister, the artist Carol Anthony of Sante Fe, N.M.; her brother, Jack M. Anthony of Seattle, and three children from her first marriage, Pedro Sanchez de Move llan of Middletown, R.I., Tessa Wohl of Stockbridge, Mass., and Mark Sanchez de Movellan of Hilversum, the Netherlands.       
         Dr. Kathelyn Sue Steimer, a leading researcher in the quest for an AIDS vaccine, died on Nov. 16 at her home in Benicia, Calif. She was 48.         The cause was cancer, according to the Chiron Corporation of Emeryville, Calif., where she was vice president for research in the vaccines division.         Dr. Steimer joined the company in 1983 and led a project that developed Chiron's candidate for a vaccine against H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. The vaccine is undergoing clinical trials on humans in the United States and Thailand. With Dr. Dino Dina and Dr. Paul Luciw, Dr. Steimer helped bring about the first sequencing and cloning of the virus, in 1985, the company said.         She led a program to evaluate and develop genetically engineered proteins of the virus for use in diagnostic assays. As vice president, she oversaw the vaccine research staff at Emeryville and coordinated efforts with vaccine research centers around the world.         She was a biology graduate of the University of California at Riverside, with a master's degree in microbiology from Pennsylvania State University and a doctorate in that specialty from the University of Pennsylvania.         Dr. Steimer is survived by her husband, Prof. Martin Wilson; a daughter, Acacia, also of Benicia; and her father, Harry Steimer of Sacramento, Calif.       
         Tess Hyman, whose efforts for nearly a half-century on behalf of fans in wheelchairs attending Giants and Jets football games earned her the nickname Tess of the Meadowlands, died yesterday morning at her home in Deerfield Beach, Fla. She was 92.         Until recent years, on any game day, Mrs. Hyman could be seen at Gate B at Giants Stadium, insuring smooth passage for the approximately 200 fans in wheelchairs and their escorts who attended the home games of the two New York area franchises in the National Football League.         Once in the stadium, she became what one paraplegic once called ''a mom to 250 kids.''         Mrs. Hyman's work was a continuation of a program started for disabled veterans more than 50 years ago by the late Dr. N. Howard Hyman, the dentist Mrs. Hyman met soon after her arrival in New York from West Virginia. She had broken a tooth on an oyster shell and he was the dentist to whom she was referred.         Soon, the two were not only courting but also working with the disabled at sporting events. Seven years after the dental appointment, and many years after escorting not only disabled veterans but any wheelchair-bound fans to games, the two were married.         The Hymans first oversaw the attendance of disabled veterans at Giants games at the Polo Grounds, then followed the team's migration to Yankee Stadium in 1956, then Giants Stadium in 1976. Soon, their efforts encompassed Jets games as well.         At first, the Hymans paid all expenses. Then more help arrived, first in small bequests from patients' wills, then finally through Preston Robert Tisch, who owns 50 percent of the Giants and who married Joan Hyman, Dr. Hyman's daughter from his first marriage.         So while her husband, whom everyone called Doc, attended to the tickets and logistics, Mrs. Hyman served cake and coffee and became a troubleshooter, all the while marveling at the medicinal effect a sport could have on those who had lost limbs, sight or the ability to walk.         ''Sometimes when they get excited, they almost stand up in their wheelchairs,'' Mrs. Hyman once said.         Mrs. Hyman was also impressed by the inner strength the disabled displayed over the years. ''They're better than regular guys,'' she said. ''Regular guys bellyache about the least little thing. These guys are grateful for what they've got left.''         She assumed control of the program in the 1980's upon her husband's death. Several years ago, both the Giants and the Jets dedicated a special section of their shared stadium to the couple.         Though she had attended hundreds of games, Mrs. Hyman admitted that she never really watched them. ''I don't understand football,'' she said in a 1991 interview. ''I've never been able to see a game through. I'm always getting up and trying to straighten something out.''         She is survived by her sister, Kathryn Parsont, and her stepdaughter, Joan.       
         Ruth Ratner Miller, a Cleveland business woman and civic leader, died on Tuesday at the Cleveland Clinic. She was 70 and a lifelong  resident of the city.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         At her death she was president of Tower City Center, part of a complex of buildings in downtown Cleveland. Topped by a 32-story structure, it contains office space, retail businesses, a Ritz-Carlton Hotel and a multiscreen movie house.         Tower City was built by her family's Forest City Enterprises, a national real-estate developer. Its New York affiliate, the Forest City Ratner Companies, is involved in several projects in Brooklyn, including Metrotech and the new Atlantic Center shopping mall.         Mrs. Miller, a member of numerous civic and community groups, contributed to causes serving women's causes, Jewish philanthropies and the State of Israel. She was a board member of the U.S. Holocaust Museum and the National Jewish Coalition and a trustee of Cleveland State University and the Western Reserve Historical Society.         For her work in support of Israel Bonds she received its David Ben-Gurion Award in 1977. She received the American Jewish Committee's Human Relations Award and the Distinguished Community Service Award from Brandeis University.         She graduated from Case Western Reserve University, where she earned a Ph.D. in guidance and counseling, and lectured in educational psychology at Case Western from 1969 to 1974. That year she joined the administration of Mayor Ralph J. Perk as director of community development and, later, director of public health and welfare.         Mrs. Miller is survived by her second husband, Rabbi Philip Horowitz; three sons, Aaron Miller of Washington, Richard Miller of Boston and Abraham Miller of Cleveland; a daughter, Gabrielle Miller of Wellesley, Mass.; a brother, Albert B. Ratner, of Cleveland, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Mary Rolfe, a radio and stage actress, died on Oct. 28 at Maui Memorial Hospital in Hawaii. She was 79 and lived in Paia, Maui.         Ms. Rolfe began her theatrical career in a touring company of ''Brother Rat.'' She soon proved herself adept at both comedy and drama and went on to appear in such plays as ''Life and Death of an American,'' ''Wallflower,'' ''See My Lawyer'' with Milton Berle and ''The Eve of St. Mark'' with William Prince.         She was also a familiar radio voice, having played for seven years in the weekly program ''The Aldrich Family'' and performed in the daytime serial ''Rose of My Dreams.''         Born in Brooklyn on Aug. 18, 1917, Ms. Rolfe was a graduate of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts.         She is survived by her husband, Lyle Bettger, an actor; two sons, Frank L., of Los Angeles and Lyle R., of Atascadero, Calif.; a daughter, Paula Newell, of Paia; a sister, Betty Darr, of Seminole, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Mara Palmer, an interior decorator who worked on yachts and offices as well as private homes in the United States and Europe, died on Nov. 20 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 77.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         Among Mrs. Palmer's assignments were the Restaurant Daniel on East 76th Street, a French restaurant that opened three years ago, and the Upper East Side apartment of James Berry Hill, owner of Berry-Hill Galleries, whose home was featured in Architectural Digest in 1992.         Mrs. Palmer is survived by a brother, Angel Srebrov of Lucerne, Switzerland; a stepdaughter, Audrey Palmer Neville of Los Angeles; a stepson, Michael Palmer of London, and four granddaughters. Her husband, Paul Palmer, died in 1983.       
         Miriam Levin Goldberg, who studied underachievement by gifted youths and taught at Teachers College of Columbia University, died on  Nov. 21 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 80 and lived in the Bronx.         The cause was emphysema, family members said.         As a faculty member at Teachers College for 26 years, Dr. Goldberg ''was very rigorous and galvanized our sense of social consciousness,'' said Dr. Susan Sacks, a former student of Dr. Goldberg's who is on the faculty at Barnard College.         Dr. Goldberg, a professor of psychology and education, was co-author, with A. Harry Passow and Abraham J. Tannenbaum, of ''Planning for Talented Youth'' (1955, Teachers College). She also wrote ''Research on the Talented'' (1965) and ''The Effect of Ability Grouping'' (1966), both published by the college.         Miriam Levin was born in 1916 in Baku in what is now Azerbaijan, and immigrated at age 5. She received her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from Teachers College.         Her husband, Carl Goldberg, died in 1972. She is survived by her son, Dr. Daniel Goldberg of Athens, Pa.; two sisters, Hannah Levin of the Bronx and Shulamis Friedman of Brooklyn; and two granddaughters.       
         Nancy Macdonald, the well-born anarchist who helped radicalize her husband, Dwight Macdonald, in the 1930's, managed his magazine Politics in the 1940's, and then struck out on her own in the 1950's to aid refugees of the Spanish civil war, died last Monday at Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 86 and had lived on East 10th Street for more than half a century.         Her son Nicholas said the cause was emphysema.         The darlings of New York's radicals in the 1930's were the half million Spanish loyalists who fought in vain against the forces of Francisco Franco, then made their way across the Pyrenees to refuge in southwestern France.         The loyalists got a lot of attention at the beginning, and those who had been Communists continued to receive support, but by the 1950's, with Franco's fascist dictatorship well established, the others had become what Mrs. Macdonald called ''the legion of the forgotten,'' languishing in poverty, unable and unwilling to return to their homeland.         It was then that Mrs. Macdonald decided to remind the world of their plight. In 1953 she founded Spanish Refugee Aid to provide help to the non-Communist exiles.         From her office on Union Square, Mrs. Macdonald attracted money and support from intellectual friends like Hannah Arendt, James T. Farrell, Alfred Kazin and Barbara Tuchman, while Pablo Casals and Francine Faure, the wife of Albert Camus, distributed the aid in France.         And her home, which had been a literary and political social center in the 1930's, was hopping once again. Where T. S. Eliot had once been among the lionized guests, Alexander Calder mingled with refugees.         There was, to be sure, one change on East 10th Street. Mr. Macdonald, who had helped establish the aid organization, was no longer around as the marriage had dissolved.         On paper, at least, the union between Dwight Macdonald and Nancy Gardiner Rodman seemed made in establishment heaven. He was Yale, she was Vassar, and both were descended from prominent families, he from the Dwights of old New England, she from the Gardiners of colonial New York.         When her brother, Selden Rodman, a poet and prominent art collector, introduced them at a party, she, the daughter of a New York architect, was fresh out of college, and he was a writer for Fortune magazine.         For all their social and establishment credentials, both had left-wing views. In his years as a founding editor of Partisan Review in the 1930's, as the founder of Politics in the 1940's and later as a social critic for The New Yorker, Mr. Macdonald acknowledged that his wife had prodded him ever leftward.         It was also her family money that enabled him to leave Fortune for The Partisan Review, where she worked as business manager. And it was her administrative skills as managing editor that helped keep Politics going  after the couple established it in their apartment in 1943.         While her husband was securing his reputation as a major critic, Mrs. Macdonald was becoming known for her intellectual fervor and for what Mr. Kazin recalled as her abiding kindness and concern for others.         Mrs. Macdonald, who peppered The New York Times and other publications with letters and articles describing the plight of the refugees, even after the death of Franco in 1974, continued to direct Spanish Refugee Aid until retiring in 1983, then summed up her work with a book in 1987 based on taped interviews, ''Homage to the Spanish Exiles: Voices from the Spanish Civil War.''         With the time and the restoration of democracy in Spain, the number of exiles has declined, but there are still 125 aging loyalists receiving help from the charity. According to the director, Margaret Childress, because of Mrs. Macdonald's financial efforts, the help will continue.         Mr. Macdonald died in 1982. In addition to her son Nicholas, of Brooklyn, and her brother of Oakland, N.J., Mrs. Macdonald is survived by another son, Michael of Manhattan, two grandchildren and one great grandchild.         Correction:  December 21, 1996, Saturday         An obituary on Monday about Nancy Macdonald, who aided refugees of the Spanish Civil War, misstated the year of Francisco Franco's death. It was 1975, not 1974.       
         At 94, Brooke Astor is giving up giving away money.         After more than 30 years of overseeing a foundation that has donated $175 million in New York City, to world-renowned cultural institutions and tiny neighborhood service programs, Mrs. Astor says she wants more time to travel and write poetry. She has decided to close the Vincent Astor Foundation, and will give away its remaining $25 million by the end of next year.         While there are many larger philanthropic foundations, few have become so entwined in the fabric of the city's life, because of Mrs. Astor's role as a social arbiter and her determination to focus her efforts on New York.         She also set a standard for personal involvement in philanthropy. Determined to know every group that received money, Mrs. Astor personally visited hundreds of organizations, from the New York Public Library to a modest program that gives furniture to formerly homeless families.         That effort began when Mrs. Astor visited two families who had been homeless and had then moved into apartments in Queens with almost no furniture.         ''How can you build a new life if you don't have any furniture?'' Mrs. Astor said. ''To move into a place and just sit there with a bag and not even have a teacup is terrible.''         She mobilized a group of nonprofit agencies and foundations to support a fledgling organization called Furnish a Future, which provides furniture at low cost for such families.         Even her giving to the city's leading institutions, including $20 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an equivalent sum sum to the New York Public Library, has been characterized by a concern for individuals, those who know her say.         Most recently, the foundation gave $250,000 for a room for the staff of the new Science, Business and Industry Library on 34th Street, and just last week she gave her annual Christmas lunch for more than 1,000 employees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Vartan Gregorian, president of Brown University, who was president of the New York Public Library from 1980 to 1988, said Mrs. Astor ''has given equal attention to janitors and guards as to librarians and curators and the rich and famous.''         Shelby White, a trustee and a donor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said: ''She set the pattern for making philanthropy socially desirable. She was the model that everyone aspired to. But she did not do it to climb social ladders. After all, she was already on top.''         In an interview at the offices of the Vincent Astor Foundation on Park Avenue, Mrs. Astor, dressed in a black Valentino suit, wide-brimmed black hat and strands of pearls, said that during 1997 she would decide how to give away the rest of the money. The recipients will primarily be education oriented, Mrs. Astor said, with existing recipients getting most of the money.         ''But we're not telling anybody what we're doing,'' Mrs. Astor said, smiling mischievously. ''We don't know ourselves yet.''         As to why she chose this moment to close down the foundation, she said simply, ''Age.''         She said she had had a wonderful time running the foundation, but added: ''I don't think I can do as much as I used to, and couldn't do it as well. I would like to have one year, before I dance into my grave, of doing something good for myself.''         Mrs. Astor, who was brought up in China, said that she wanted to make one more trip there. Now that she has taken to writing poetry -- she has had two poems published in The New Yorker -- she said she hopes to spend more time writing.         Mrs. Astor said she had considered keeping the foundation going with someone else at the helm, but decided against it.         ''My son is not an Astor,'' she said, referring to her son, Tony Russell, from an earlier marriage. ''There is no family to leave it to. If you have children, like the Rockefellers did, you leave it to your children. If you have no children, I think it is a nice idea to close it.''         For his part, Mr. Russell said he supported his mother's decision, noting how difficult it would have been to take over an effort so strongly identified with her. ''I would hate to second-guess, 'Is this something that my mother would like to give to?' '' he said.         Mrs. Astor's efforts began in earnest in 1959, when her third husband, Vincent Astor, died, leaving the foundation assets of $67 million.         The decision to focus the foundation's philanthropy on New York was hers. The foundation's only mandate was ''the alleviation of human misery,'' but Mrs. Astor decided that since the Astor family money derived in part from New York City real estate, she wanted to return it to the city.         ''The mandate has been pretty straightforward,'' said Linda Gillies, the foundation's director. ''Housing, literacy, the arts and some planning and landmarks.''         From the beginning, Mrs. Astor was deeply and personally involved.  Marjory Rice, the director of Furnish a Future, said Mrs. Astor has appeared at functions for the organization and helped raise money. ''It creates a wonderful stir of excitement,'' she said. ''It is is sort of like having a wonderful magic wand.''         Another favorite cause has been the Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day High School, which lets young people who have dropped out of high school and started working  get a high school diploma. Its founder and principal, Howard Friedman, wrote to the Astor foundation in 1989 seeking money for a library. Mrs. Astor spent a day visiting the school, and since then the school has received $50,000.         ''She spent hours there,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''I got worried because it was so hot and she was going up and down the stars from room to room. She started speaking Chinese with the Chinese students. She really bonded with students. From that we developed a relationship.''         Mrs. Astor said she was struck by the students' efforts to help themselves. ''They were the sort of children who wanted to do something but did not have the proper education, and they realized that,'' she said.         The Astor foundation has been known for spreading its wealth over a wide range of causes. Of the $1.58 million the foundation gave away in 1995, 105 of the total of 111 grants were between $1,000 and $50,000.         Mrs. Astor is best known for her affiliation with the New York Public Library. During the 1980's, she resigned from the boards of Rockefeller University and the Bronx Zoo to work more intensely for the library.         Mr. Gregorian said that one approach he and Mrs. Astor settled on to raise money was to convince people that being associated with the library was good for them.         ''People don't add class to the library,'' he said. ''It was the library that added class to them. To serve the library is to service civilization, culture and democracy. It is the only institution that can be populist and elitist.''         Mrs. Astor has been able to meld the worlds of society and accomplishment in an unusually public way. Mr. Gregorian recalled that when Mrs. Astor gave a dinner for the library, she invited virtually the same people she had recently invited to a party for President Reagan.         The library's chairwoman, Elizabeth Rohatyn, said it was hard to imagine the future without Mrs. Astor's involvement. But, she said, ''With the reflection of her vast interest, the library has evolved into a very strong institution.''         The Astor foundation will close down in a year, but Mrs. Astor is unlikely to forsake her role at the center of New York life. ''I adore people,'' she said.         Correction:  December 21, 1996, Saturday         An article on Wednesday about Brooke Astor's plans to close the Vincent Astor Foundation misidentified her son, who expressed support for his mother's decision against leaving it in his hands or someone else's. He is Anthony D. Marshall, not Tony Russell.       
         Mary Cooper Jewett Gaiser, a philanthropist who served on the boards of nonprofit institutions in the fields of education, community service and the arts, died on Sunday at Deaconess Medical Center in Spokane, Wash. She was 95 and lived in Spokane.         Over the years, Mrs. Gaiser (pronounced like ''geyser'') served on the boards of numerous institutions that were beneficiaries of her largess. She was a trustee of Wellesley College, of which she was an alumna, for 18 years. She was active in fund-raising for Wellesley, and its Jewett Art Center is named for her first husband, George Frederick Jewett, who died in 1956. He was chairman and president of Potlatch Forests, a forest-products concern based in Lewiston, Idaho. .         Her philanthropy extended to other educational institutions, including the American University of Beirut, Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash., and Church Divinity School of the Pacific in Berkeley, Calif., all of which she served as a trustee. Mrs. Gaiser had been on the national board of the Young Women's Christian Association since the late 1940's. ''Women are wonderful,'' she once declared. ''Like tea bags, they never know their strength until they get into hot water.''         She was president of the Spokane Y.W.C.A. during World War II, and oversaw programs to help women and children with problems related to the war. In addition, she was on the boards of the Spokane Arts Commission, which she helped set up, and of what is now the Spokane Symphony orchestra, in whose founding she was instrumental. In 1987, after donating $225,000 to the orchestra's endowment, she said: ''Half the fun of life is sharing. People are missing a lot of satisfaction if they don't get pleasure from using their abilities to help others.''         She and Mr. Jewett also played an important role in the construction of the Episcopal Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Spokane.         A doctor's daughter, Mrs. Gaiser was born in Ogdensburg, N.Y., received a bachelor's degree from Wellesley in 1923, and taught school in Bronxville, N.Y. until she married Mr. Jewett in 1925. They lived in communities in Idaho until they moved to Spokane in 1937. She married Dr. David Wesley Gaiser, a surgeon, in 1961, and he died in 1985.         Mrs. Gaiser is survived by a son, George Frederick Jewett Jr. of San Francisco; a daughter, Margaret Jewett Greer of Chevy Chase, Md.; six grandchildren; nine great-grandchildren; a sister, Janet Cooper Dakin of Irvington, Va., and a brother, Dr. William Grant Cooper Jr., of Little Rock, Ark.       
         Joan Hartman-Goldsmith, an art historian and writer known for her expertise in Chinese works, especially jade, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         At her death Mrs. Goldsmith was the director of the Institute for Asian Studies on East 44th Street, which she founded in 1981 as a school for adult education. Its lecture programs cover a wide range of historical and contemporary subjects pertaining to Asia.         She also was a member of the art committee of the China Institute in America, which has its headquarters on East 65th Street. She established the institute's art gallery and helped in its work for nearly three decades.         She contributed numerous articles and book reviews to art publications and also wrote about jade and Chinese art for the general reader. Her most recent book was ''Chinese Jade,'' published in 1986 by Oxford University Press in Hong Kong.         Born Joan Lederman in Malden, Mass., she graduated from George Washington High School in Manhattan. She studied Chinese art on her own for 10 years and started a career at the China Institute and the School for Continuing Education at New York University. In the 1970's she worked as an administrator at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan.         Mrs. Goldsmith made 13 trips to China, most recently in June. She lectured at the Cooper-Hewitt Institute of Design as well as other museums and institutes across the country and abroad.         A marriage to Alan Hartman ended in divorce.         Mrs. Goldsmith is survived by her husband, Robert L. Goldsmith; a daughter, Hedy Hartman of St. George, S.I.; and a sister, Louisa Lubar of Newton Centre, Mass.       
         Carol Robbins, a trained musician, educator and co-director of the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy at New York University, died on Dec. 12 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 54.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Clive Robbins.         She started her musical education at 8 and, by the time she finished high school, was an accomplished vocalist, church organist and accompanist. She earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in music education at the Crane School of Music at State University College in Potsdam, N.Y., and was certified as a teacher for youngsters with perceptual handicaps. She started training in music therapy in 1966 with Paul Nordoff and Dr. Robbins, founders of a creative music therapy practiced at schools in this country and Europe. Her own career began at the Little Red School House in Poughkeepsie.         After she and Dr. Robbins were married in 1975, the couple worked as a team. They developed a music curriculum for the New York State School for the Deaf in Rome, N.Y., working with severely hearing-impaired youngsters.         With Prof. Arthur Boothroyd they researched musical perception by such children as a basis for establishing techniques aimed at getting even the most profoundly deaf among them to play music.         Mrs. Robbins's vocal and keyboard skills at improvisation added versatility to their work and freedom to explore. Together, the Robbinses wrote ''Music for the Hearing Impaired and Other Special Groups: A Resource Manual and Curriculum Guide'' (MMB Music, 1980), a standard text in this specialized field.         She taught Nordoff-Robbins music therapy at institutes and schools in London, Germany and Japan and traveled worldwide to lecture and teach. She and Dr. Robbins returned to this country in 1989 to establish and direct the center at N.Y.U. within the Graduate Music Therapy Program, where it provides treatment, training and research.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Robbins is survived by a daughter, Debra Matteson of Ilion, N.Y.; her mother, Adalyn Matteson, and her siblings, Christine Phinney and David Matteson, all of Oswego.       
         Peggy Wattles Pulleyn, whose grandchild's ill fortune moved her to found the Princeton Child Development Institute in 1970, died on Dec. 8 in a freakish accident near her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 85.         According to the Somerset County Prosecutor's office, she was walking on a road in Bedminster when a car driven by a longtime friend, Allison Ewing, backing up to meet her, lurched out of control and struck her. No charges were filed against Mrs. Ewing, 76, who is the wife of New Jersey's senior State Senator, John H. Ewing of Bernardsville.         The institute in Princeton, now caring for about 40 autistic children, has grown into a nationally recognized center that has served as a model elsewhere in the country. Its science-based program, backed by research and staff training, was recognized by the Federal Government in 1983 when it cited the Institute as one of 60 exemplary private schools in the country.         Mrs. Pulleyn felt the need for such a school in 1968 when her family realized that her first grandson, Rollie, was autistic, a still-enigmatic condition with many associated disorders. Her search for a suitable program for the child led her, her daughter and some other parents in the Princeton region to start their own school.         From modest beginnings with 17 children, the institute moved into its own home in Princeton, where a further addition was completed this year. Mrs. Pulleyn was an original board member.         She served as its longtime chairwoman, raising funds for the state-supported institute. Up to her death, she remained active on the board, and was also active in another project: the Magic Shop in Oldwick.         Founded just after World War II, it is a gift shop that initially assisted returning veterans. Since then, it has been a financial supporter of the nearby Bonnie Brae Home for Boys, a boarding institution that teaches troubled children academic subjects and trade skills.         Mrs. Pulleyn, an amateur artist, contributed her work and staffed the counter to sell the Magic Shop's wide variety of children's clothing and other handmade materials. The day before her death, she suited up the shop's Santa for the season.         Peggy Wattles grew up in Buffalo and graduated from Bennett Junior College in Millbrook, N.Y. She was an outstanding amateur golfer who won New York State championships in the 1930's and twice reached the quarterfinals of the United States Women's National Golf Tournament.         Mrs. Pulleyn's husband, Robert, a lawyer, died in 1990. She is survived by her daughter, Pamela Pulleyn Machold of Princeton; a brother, Gurdon W. Wattles of Oldwick; a sister, Elizabeth Wattles of Hightstown, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Margret E. Rey, who teamed with her husband to create the ''Curious George'' children's books featuring the inquisitive little monkey, died on Saturday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 90.         Mrs. Rey died from complications following a heart attack she suffered about three weeks ago, according to a statement released by her publisher Houghton Mifflin, in Boston.         She and her husband, H. A. Rey, created Curious George in the 1930's while living in Paris, where they had settled after their honeymoon. Just before the German invasion in 1940, the couple fled to the United States with the unsold manuscript. Houghton Mifflin published ''Curious George'' the following year and six sequels over the next 25 years.         Mrs. Rey also created 28 other Curious George books in collaboration with Alan J. Shelleck. These adventures also became an animated television series.         In an interview with The Associated Press, Mrs. Rey once said she and her husband had a simple reason for creating the book: They needed money. More than 20 million Curious George books have been sold in 12 languages. Hans Augusto Rey, who illustrated the books, died in 1977.         ''Margret lived to the fullest every minute of her long and productive life and enriched the lives of millions,'' said Nader F. Darehshori, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Houghton Mifflin.         The theme behind the Curious George books was elementary: A trouble-finding money who creates a mild uproar and has to be saved or saves the day. A prime example of the theme in the Curious George books can be found in ''Curious George Goes to the Hospital,'' in which George swallows a piece of a jigsaw puzzle and is run through a battery of hospital tests. The tale is designed to put at ease children who might face a similar crisis in real life.         Discussing the Curious George phenomenon, Hillel Stavis, a longtime friend who, with his wife, Donna Friedman, runs a shop called Curious George Goes to Wordsworth, a bookstore on Harvard Square, said: ''The art work is endearing and it is pretty timeless. It actually looks quite contemporary now.         ''It is also very nostalgic for the baby boomers, and it is an intriguing idea, a monkey that is very mischievous but not scary,'' added Mr. Stavis.         Born in Hamburg, Germany, Mrs. Rey met her husband as a girl and they married in 1935. Prior to her marriage, she studied at the Bauhaus in Dessau, Germany, and art schools in Dusseldorf and Berlin. She also worked as a reporter and a photographer.         It was in Paris, though, that a publisher expressed interest in a comic drawing of a giraffe by Hans Augusto. The publisher then asked the couple to collaborate on a book for children. The book, ''Rafi et les Neuf Singes,'' published in 1939, was the model for Curious George, which two years later became a hit in the United States.         ''We worked very closely together,'' she said in an interview in 1977, ''and it was hard to pull the thing apart and say who did what.''         Besides the Curious George series, Mrs. Rey created five other books published, including ''Spotty'' and Pretzel.'' She also ran a Curious George merchandising program.         Mrs. Rey left no known survivors, except, of course, for Curious George.       
         Anne Schwerner, a retired New York teacher and the mother of Michael H. Schwerner, a 24-year-old civil-rights worker killed by Ku Klux Klansmen near Philadelphia, Miss., in 1964, died on Friday at a nursing home in Kettering, Ohio. A former resident of Pelham, N.Y., she was 84.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Born Anne Seigel in the Bronx, she graduated from Hunter College in biology, earned a master's degree in education at Queens College and started a teaching career in the city's public schools. She then taught at New Rochelle High School for 20 years until her retirement in 1976.         After their son's death, she and her husband, Nathan, helped raise money for groups like the Congress on Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and lobbied for Federal voting-rights legislation.         Mrs. Schwerner is survived by another son, Stephen of Yellow Springs, Ohio; her brother, Morris Seigel, a resident of Florida, and two granddaughters. Nathan Schwerner, a retired wig manufacturer, died in 1991.       
         Patricia Johnson Deely, a retired New York social worker and psychotherapist who helped build one of the city's agencies for drug addicts and others needing social services, died on Dec. 15 at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 73 and lived on the Upper East Side and in Stockbridge, Mass.         The cause was cancer, Mary D. Kierstead, a family friend, said.         Mrs. Deely, who practiced psychotherapy in Manhattan until a few years ago, was a founding sponsor of the Lower East Side Service Center in 1959. At the time, she was working with adolescent addicts at Riverside Hospital on North Brother Island, now Roosevelt Island.         She was the center's president for 10 years in the 1960's and 70's. At times, the board met in her home, and she remained active serving the center until her illness worsened.         Although the center kept its original name, it has grown into a citywide service treating some 2,500 a year as outpatients and residents.         Mrs. Deely, a native of Manhattan, graduated from Adelphi University and received a master's degree from the Hunter College School of Social Work. She also served on charitable boards benefiting children, including the Spence-Chapin Adoption Service, as well as the Norman Rockwell Museum and the Berkshire Botanical Garden.         She is survived by her husband of nearly 50 years, James Sedgwick Deely, and two daughters, Catharine D. Stansfield of Sherman Oaks, Calif., and Pamela Van de Loo of Loudonville, N.Y.       
         Elizabeth Ege Freudenheim, a freelance writer and author who specialized in writing about crafts, textiles and the arts, died yesterday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Milt, who is a reporter for The New York Times.         After starting her career in Ohio as a curator at the Akron Art Institute, she began to contribute articles to The Chicago Daily News and The International Herald Tribune in Paris. Later, using Betty Freudenheim as her byline, she regularly contributed columns on crafts to The New York Times and wrote for magazines like American Crafts and Fiber Arts. With Jack Lenor Larsen, she was co-author of ''Interlacing: The Elemental Fabric.''         Besides her husband of 44 years, Mrs. Freudenehim is survived by two daughters, Jo Frisch of Buffalo and Susan Core of Los Angeles; two sons, John M. and Tom, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
         Marian Shaw, a theatrical producer and the widow of Irwin Shaw, the novelist and playwright, died on Friday in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 80 and lived in Klosters, Switzerland, and Mougins, France.         Mrs. Shaw was born in New York City and grew up in Hollywood, where, at the age of 15, she became an actress. She and Mr. Shaw were married in 1939 and moved to Paris in 1950 after the publication of his novel ''The Young Lions.'' In Paris and Klosters, she and her husband became the center of a wide circle of writers, artists and actors. Mrs. Shaw produced plays in Paris, including the French adaptation of Ira Wallach's Broadway comedy ''Absence of a Cello.''         She is survived by a son, Adam, of Thones, France.       
         Virginia Downing, an actress in theater, films and television for 70 years, died on Nov. 21 in Manhattan. She was 92 and was on her way to a theater.         Ms. Downing appeared in many Broadway productions and acted off Broadway as well. She played the Duchess of York in the 1990 New York Shakespeare Festival production of ''Richard III,'' which starred Denzel Washington.         She also played supporting roles in ''A Gift of Time,'' with Henry Fonda; ''We Have Always Lived in the Castle'' and ''The Cradle Will Rock.'' Her Off Broadway appearances included ''Mercy Street,'' with Marian Seldes; ''Juno and the Paycock'' and ''The Man With the Golden Arm.''         She also acted in Samuel Beckett's ''All That Fall'' and toured the United States and Ireland in O'Casey's ''Plough and the Stars.''         Ms. Downing was born in Washington and was a graduate of Bryn Mawr College. She began her career as a translator of plays for Garson Kanin.         She is survived by her husband, John Leighton, an actor.       
         Mary Leakey, matriarch of the famous fossil-hunting family in Africa whose own reputation in paleoanthropology soared with discoveries of bones, stone tools and the footprints of early human ancestors, died yesterday in Nairobi, Kenya. She was 83.         Her family announced her death but did not give the cause, saying only that she died peacefully.         Over half a century, Mary Leakey labored under the hot African sun, scratching in the dirt for clues to early human physical and cultural evolution. Scientists in her field said she set the standards for documentation and excavation in paleolithic archeology. They spoke of hers as a life of enviable achievement.         ''She was one of the world's great originals,'' said Dr. Alan Walker, an anatomist at Pennsylvania State University who has long excavated fossils with the Leakey family. ''Untrained except in art, she developed techniques of excavation and descriptive archeology and did it all on her own in the middle of Africa. It was an extraordinary life.''         In a biography of the Leakey family, ''Ancestral Passions,'' published last year by Simon & Schuster, Virginia Morell characterized Mary Leakey as ''the grande dame of archeology.''         Beginning in the 1930's, Mary Leakey and her late husband, Louis, awakened the world to Africa's primary place in human origins with their spectacular discoveries and increasingly pushed back the time of those origins much earlier than had been thought. Until then, many scientists still believed the human birthplace would be found in Asia.         She discovered the skull of Proconsul africanus, an apelike ancestor of both apes and early humans that lived about 25 million years ago. In 1959, her discovery of a well-preserved skull of a hominid, a member of the extended human ancestral family, brought fame and substantial financial backing to the Leakeys. A few years later, the two Leakeys uncovered the fossils of the first known member of the genus Homo habilis, or ''able man,'' in recognition of the many stone tools found among the bones.         From then on, the name Leakey was synonymous with the study of human origins. The flamboyant Louis seemed to know just where to look to find revealing fossils; the envious spoke of ''Leakey's luck.'' Meanwhile, Mary Leakey worked in her husband's shadow, seeing to the plodding excavations and meticulous documentation of their finds.         ''Louis was always a better publicist than scientist,'' said E. Barton Worthington, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London and former African explorer. ''Mary was the real fossil hunter.''         After Louis Leakey's death in 1972, Mary Leakey overcame some of her natural shyness to assume direction of the family fossil enterprise, which by then one of their sons, Richard, joined as an expedition leader. Her operations centered on Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli, both in Tanzania. On the arid plain of Laetoli, she made her most sensational discovery in 1978: the earliest footprints of a human ancestor.         A Playful Moment, But a Fateful One         As often happens, the discovery of the prints was made by chance -- more Leakey luck. While tossing dried elephant dung in a playful camp fight, one scientist on Mrs. Leakey's expedition fell down and saw in the gray surface some curious indentations. They were imprints of raindrops and animals, now hardened to stone and recently exposed by erosion and weathering.         After further exploration, scientists determined that the tracks were made about 3.7 million years ago. The animals had walked over volcanic ash when it was damp from rain, leaving impressions of their feet. The wet ash set like concrete and was later covered over by more ash and silt. There the tracks remained to be found by dung-throwing scientists.         It was two years before a scientist uncovered a heel print that hinted of an even more significant find. It seemed to belong to a hominid. On Aug. 2, 1978, Mrs. Leakey spent three hours examining one of the clearest of these prints. She cleaned the crevices of the print with a small brush and dental pick. All the important elements were preserved: heel, toes and arch. She appraised the print from every possible angle.         Finally, Mrs. Leakey stood up from her work, lit a cigar and announced, ''Now this really is something to put on the mantelpiece.''         She was at last sure that a hominid had left this print and a trail of prints extending more than 75 feet across the plain. Two and possibly three individuals had walked this way 3.7 million years ago: the larger one, presumably a male; the smaller one, presumably female, and an even smaller individual, perhaps their child, whose prints are sometimes superimposed on the others.         In a Footprint a Clue To Human Behavior         Somewhere along the way, as Mrs. Leakey noted, the female appeared to pause and turn to her left. She might have sensed danger, possibly from a predator or the rumble of a volcanic eruption nearby. Then she resumed her walk to the north.         ''This motion, so intensely human, transcends time,'' Mrs. Leakey wrote in the National Geographic magazine. ''A remote ancestor -- just as you or I -- experienced a moment of doubt.''         These evocative footprints are the earliest known traces of human behavior. At the time, the discovery established that human ancestors had begun walking upright much earlier than previously thought, long before the evolution of larger brains. Whether upright walking preceded the larger brain, or vice versa, was still a much-debated issue among scholars.         With the discovery of a species called Australopithecus afarensis, based on the famous Lucy skeleton, the most likely identity of these prehistoric strollers was established. The species lived between 3.9 million and 3 million years ago, and from the fossils paleontologists have determined that they were as capable of walking upright as modern humans.         ''I think it's the most important find in view of human evolution,'' Mrs. Leakey was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in an interview in September. ''I was really looking for tools, but we never found any at the site.''         In Stone Age Art, Two Interests Merged         She also looked back fondly on what she called another highlight of her career. She was a budding artist before she met and later married Mr. Leakey, when she turned to fossil hunting and archeology. In 1951, her two interests merged briefly.         Mrs. Leakey recorded on drawing paper some 1,600 of the thousands of late Stone Age paintings in the Kondoa-Irangi region of Tanzania. The work gave her ''a great sense of happiness and well-being,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''Disclosing the Past,'' published in 1984, because the drawings afforded a glimpse of the lives of the hunter-gatherers who painted them. ''No amounts of stone and bone could yield the kinds of information that the paintings gave so freely,'' she said.         One of her last books was a collection of these Stone Age drawings, entitled ''Africa's Vanishing Art: the Rock Paintings of Tanzania'' and published in 1983.         Art and, to some extent, prehistory were part of Mary Leakey's heritage. She was born Mary Douglas Nicol on Feb. 6, 1913 in London. Her father, Erskine Nicol, was a prolific and fairly successful landscape painter, as was his father before him. Her mother, Cecilia Marion Frere, was a descendant of John Frere, a British prehistorian who in 1797 first recognized Stone Age flint implements as primitive tools and weapons.         After World War I, the family spent months each year in Switzerland, France or Italy, where the father painted and took Mary to archeological ruins and the caves painted by Cro-Magnon hunters. As she said, this was the source of her early interest in archeology.         ''Basically, I have been compelled by curiosity,'' she wrote in her autobiography. But formal education was not for her.         Bored by class work and her fellow students, Mary was expelled from two schools and so, with attending a university out of the question, decided to pursue independent studies in drawing and archeology. ''I had never passed a single school exam, and clearly never would,'' she wrote.         At the age of 20, Mary Nicol, a sometime illustrator of stone tools and occasional participant in archeological digs, met Louis Leakey, 10 years her senior, married and an established figure in African archeology with a position at Cambridge University. He asked her to help him with drawings for a book, and she readily agreed. A romance followed, and then scandal.         Scandal in Cambridge Led to Magic of Africa         They would marry as soon as his divorce came through. Meanwhile, they did nothing to conceal the intimacy of their relationship, living together for more than a year in a cottage near Cambridge. This eventually cost him his post at Cambridge, the memory of which was dancing lightly through Mary Leakey's mind years later as she walked up the aisle at Cambridge to receive an honorary doctorate degree.         The two were married in 1936 and set out for Africa, where he had grown up as the son of British missionaries. As Mrs. Leakey wrote later, she was never the same again after ''Africa had cast its spell'' on her. Much of their marriage was spent at dig sites. ''Given the chance, I'd rather be in a tent than in a house,'' she said in a recent interview with Associated Press.         It was a discovery by the Leakeys in 1959 that, according to Dr. F. Clark Howell of the University of California at Berkeley, marked ''the beginnings of paleoanthropology in a modern sense.'' The pace of exploration quickened. Geologists and anatomists joined the quest, a multidisciplinary approach that the Leakeys did much to promote.         On a July day in 1959, as Louis lay ill in camp, Mary stumbled on some teeth and part of a jaw on a slope of Olduvai Gorge. Rushing back to her husband, she exclaimed, ''I've found him -- found our man.''         How the couple celebrated is not recorded. But in her autobiography, Mrs. Leakey wrote that after an earlier major find they ''cast aside care'' and that was how their son Philip ''came to join our family.''         The 1959 discovery turned out to be a 1.8 million-year-old fossil known as the ''nutcracker man'' because of its huge jaws and molar teeth. It was later designated Australopithecus boisei.         As Two Lives Diverged, A New Independence         From 1968 until Louis Leakey's death in 1972, he and Mary Leakey were separated. He spent more and more of his time in the celebrity whirl, raising money and lecturing,  while she stuck to her digging at Olduvai. She was becoming more independent, opposing some of her husband's more sensational interpretations of discoveries.         ''I ended by losing my professional respect for Louis; and it had been very great indeed,'' she wrote. ''Once that was so I was no longer able to offer the concurrence and unquestioning adulation he now seemed to demand.''         Another unsettling episode in her life was the controversy between her and Richard Leakey, on one side, and Dr. Donald C. Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy, on the other. She insisted on the removal of her name from the joint authorship of a paper that made assumptions about the place of the Lucy species human evolution.         Mrs. Leakey retired from fieldwork in 1983, still smoking small Cuban cigars and accompanied by her beloved Dalmatians. Her honors were many for a woman who never finished high school: medals from the National Geographic Society, the Geological Society of London and the Royal Swedish Academy and many honorary degrees.         She is survived by her three sons, Jonathan, Richard and Philip, all of Kenya, and by 10 grandchildren.       
         Suzanne Railey, a representative for Christie's auction house who was known for her talents as an international hostess, died last weekend in her Manhattan apartment. She was 85.         She died in her sleep, Ed Gallagher, a longtime friend, told Christie's. She had a list of guests for her next dinner party at her bedside, he said.         Ms. Railey, who was known as Sue, lived most of her life in Paris and New York, and had been employed by Christie's in New York since March 1985. She was a public relations ambassador of sorts. Her only  role for the auction house was to hold a black-tie dinner party at her home each month, drawing on her long list of wealthy and influential friends, many with extensive art collections. The idea was to generate good will, and eventually business, for the auction house.         Seated at the tables in her two bedroom apartment in the East 60's  would be diplomats, society doyennes and fashion designers.         ''It all depends who's in town and what I'm thinking about,'' Ms. Railey said during an interview last week.         The jewelry designer Kenneth Jay Lane, a frequent dinner guest at her house, said: ''You never knew who you'd be seated next to. She always had good people. And her apartment was amazing, with more objects than you could count on every table and mirrors on the ceilings.''         Entertaining and collecting were what she enjoyed.         ''You must talk to me about dinner parties,'' Ms. Railey said, standing at Alexis Gregory's dinner party on Dec. 2, clutching a black pocketbook with a big white clock on top. ''I love them so much. It's just so much more attractive to entertain at home. You can actually sit and talk.''         Christopher Burge, the chairman of Christie's, said, ''Her apartment was filled with all these treasures of Europe.'' She collected portraits from the French Revolutionary period, miniatures and African works of art, and also had a large collection of letter seals.         She was born Suzanne Rosenberg in Rochester. Her family owned a department store. As a young girl she traveled to Manhattan, Washington and Paris with her parents, said David Granger, a longtime friend.         She lived in Manhattan during part of her 20's with an uncle, Ed Goodman, who owed Finchley's, a men's clothing store. Mr. Granger said, ''And she did what popular young girls do, she traveled and went to parties.''         Then she moved to Washington,  where she started Overcoats for Britain, a program shipping coats to England during World War II.         In 1950, she married Howard Barclay Railey, a businessman who was attached to the American Embassy in Paris. For the next 33 years, she lived and entertained in ''a romantic apartment overlooking the Seine in Paris,'' said Ethel de Croisset, a close friend who lives in Paris.         ''She was a born brilliant hostess,'' she said. ''She was always friends with all the ambassadors.'' When her husband died, Ms. Railey moved back to Manhattan and began working for Christie's.         She is survived by two stepsons.

         Amelia Agostino del Rio, a professor, author and longtime head of the Spanish department at Barnard College, died on Wednesday in Spring Lake, N.J., where she lived. She was 100.         Mrs. del Rio wrote more than 45 books of poetry, essays, plays, short stories and art history, and, in collaboration with her husband, Angel del Rio, ''Antologia de la Literatura Espanola,'' which was considered to be the Bible of Spanish literature.         She was born in Yauco in Puerto Rico. In 1918, after teaching in local high schools, she moved to New York. Later she worked her way through Vassar College by teaching Spanish, and graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1922. She received a master's degree from Columbia University.         In 1929, she began teaching at Barnard, where she was head of the Spanish department from 1941 to 1962. While at Barnard, she often acted in Spanish plays, playing a leading role in Federico Garcia Lorca's ''House of Bernardo Alba.''         During the 1940's and 50's, she and her husband were known for opening their house to such Spanish intellectuals and writers as Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guillen, Camilo Jose Cela, Gabriel Mistral and Garcia Lorca. Recently she had been writing her recollections of Garcia Lorca's time in New York, including his visit with the del Rios in Shandaken, N.Y., in the summer of 1929.         In the 1970's, she returned to Puerto Rico, where she continued teaching and and where she wrote for local newspapers. She founded the Museo de Reproducciones Artisticas in Bayamon, P.R. The museum opened in 1985.         She was honored by Mayor Robert Wagner with a key to the city of New York and by Juan Carlos I, the King of Spain, with the highest civilian honor in that country. She also received the Citizen of the Year Award from the Institute of Puerto Rico.         She is survived by a daughter, Carmen R. de Pinies of Spring Lake;  six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 17, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary on Saturday about a professor, author and longtime head of the Spanish department at Barnard College misspelled her maiden name. She was Amelia Agostini del Rio, not Agostino.       
         Marjory Banks Grannis, a lecturer and community volunteer, died last Saturday at her home in Lake Bluff, Ill. She was 80 and also had a summer home in Edgartown, Mass.         Mrs. Grannis was the mother of the New York State Assemblyman Alexander B. (Pete) Grannis, who represents the Upper East Side. She grew up in New York City and Suffern, N.Y., and attended art school in Florence.         In 1991, she helped write and publish ''Visiting the Midwest Historical Preservation Sites,'' a guide to towns of historical and architectural interest within a day's drive of Chicago. For many years she was active in the English-Speaking Union of the United States, serving on the national board of governors and as president of the Chicago branch.         She worked with the Junior Leagues of New York, Chicago and Birmingham, Mich., where was president. As a member of the Colonial Dames of America, she helped refurbish Widow Clark House, Chicago's oldest standing house, which is now a museum.         Besides Assemblyman Grannis, she is survived by her husband of 56 years, Uri Balcom Grannis; two other sons, Uri B. 3d, of Petoskey, Mich., and Jonathan G., of Winnetka, Ill.; a sister, Elspeth B. Furlaud of New York City, six grandchildren and a step-grandson.       
         Dr. Margaret Jeffrey Rioch, a clinical psychologist who developed an innovative training program in psychotherapy, died on Nov. 25 at her home in Chevy Chase, Md. She was 89.         Dr. Rioch was a professor emeritus of psychology at American University here. She was one of the first Western psychologists to be trained in Zen teaching under Dr. Hubert Benoit in Paris.         In the 1960's, while working at the National Institute of Mental Health, she developed a training program for middle-aged women seeking to pursue careers in psychotherapy. She believed that this would create opportunities for women in search of careers or those who sought to return to the workplace. It later became the model for programs around the country.         Dr. Rioch also founded and directed the A. K Rice Institute, an organization that studied group relations.         Dr. Rioch, a native of Paterson, N.J., graduated from Wellesley College and received a master's degree and doctorate in philology from Bryn Mawr College. She trained at the Washington School of Psychiatry.         Dr. David Rioch, her husband, died in 1985. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Helen Wilson, a staunch advocate of patients' rights as administrator for the Association of the Attending Staff at Mount Sinai Medical Center, died yesterday at the hospital. Mrs. Wilson, who lived on the Upper East Side, was 82.         The cause was cancer, a daughter, Victoria Wilson, said.         Working with the practicing physicians at Mount Sinai for more than 20 years, Mrs. Wilson was a champion of better patient care and increased respect for nurses.         Mrs. Wilson retired in 1984. At the time, she held the titles of secretary to the medical board, secretary to the board of trustees and head of the medical staff services office, in addition to that of administrator for the Association  of the Attending Staff.         The Association of the Attending Staff persuaded Mrs. Wilson to stay on, and  she continued as the organization's administrator until her death.         Mrs. Wilson joined Mount Sinai in 1962 as administrative assistant to the director of nurses. After a few years, she left briefly to work as a theater producer, but she returned in the late 60's and remained.         Mrs. Wilson was born in Manhattan and educated at the Dalton School, the University of Wisconsin and Hunter College.         Always an activist, she was involved in anti-Fascist causes during the Spanish Civil War, supported Russian War Relief and was often seen on picket lines.         In the early 1950's, after her marriage to the novelist and physicist Mitchell Wilson, which was to end in divorce, the couple lived on Martha's Vineyard for several years.         At that time, Mrs. Wilson gave up her work as administrative assistant to the president of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and with her husband founded the Martha's Vineyard Little Theater, where they produced and directed plays.         In addition to her daughter Victoria, of Manhattan, Mrs. Wilson is survived by another daughter, Erica Silverman, also of Manhattan.       
         Anita Diamant Berke, a literary agent who nurtured the career of V. C. Andrews, the best-selling novelist, died on Saturday at her home in Weston, Conn. She was 78.         The cause was a heart attack, relatives said.         Anita Diamant, as she was known in her professional life, created the Anita Diamant Literary Agency in 1971 after working in various magazine posts. The agency now represents about 125 writers.         In 1976, Ms. Diamant got a letter from a Norfolk, Va., woman who wanted to be a writer. The woman, V. C. Andrews, soon sent along a manuscript, which Ms. Diamant liked and sold to the Pocket Books division of Simon & Schuster. The book, "Flowers in the Attic," has sold millions of copies worldwide and led to Ms. Andrews's fame.         Ms. Diamant was a longtime member of the Overseas Press Club and was its first woman president, from 1981 to 1986.         Her husband, Harold B. Berke, died in 1972. Surviving are a daughter, Allyson Forsythe; a brother, David Diamant, and two grandchildren, all of Weston.       
         Josephine Patterson Albright, who flew the mail, shot tigers in India, covered Chicago crime in journalism's colorful "Front Page" era, ran an Illinois dairy and pig farm, bred horses in Wyoming, wrote a column about her family and  helped establish a foundation for journalists, died on Monday at her home in Woodstock, Vt. She was 82.         A daughter, Alice Arlen of Manhattan, said the death was caused by complications after a stroke.         Mrs. Albright was a member of one of the most prominent families in American journalism. Her father, Joseph Medill Patterson, founded The Daily News in New York and helped found The Chicago Tribune. Her aunt, Eleanor Medill Patterson, published The Washington Times-Herald, and her older sister, Alicia Patterson, founded, published and edited Newsday.         Like Alicia, who was seven years her senior, Josephine was told by her father that journalism was not for women. Both proved him wrong.         When Josephine earned her spurs in Chicago in the early 1930's, interviewing  killers like George (Baby Face) Nelson and covering murders and the criminal courts, she worked not for her father's newspaper but for a rival paper, The Chicago Daily News, whose staff members served as models for the characters in the classic Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur comedy "The Front Page."         In "Ladies of the Press" (Harper & Brothers, 1936), Ishbel Ross wrote, "She sailed along successfully under her own steam, in spite of the professional handicap of being born into a noted newspaper family."         Josephine Patterson was born in Libertyville, Ill., on Dec. 2, 1913, and educated at the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va. Although her father disapproved of women in journalism, he did approve of women as pilots, and she got her pilot's license at the age of 16. Before her 18th birthday, she was the  youngest pilot flying the mail route between Chicago and St. Louis.         But Josephine's career as a commercial mail pilot lasted only a few months. At 18, in the midst of her debutante party, she decided to fly with Alicia to India to hunt tigers. Without telling their mother, the two young women hopscotched their way across the world, dancing every night.         When they arrived in India, Josephine, who was later to become an ardent animal rights activist and naturalist, quickly bagged a tiger.         Alicia, who was supposed to shoot the tiger, was angry. She told her sister to stay out of the next hunt. So Josephine went on the next hunt carrying only a book. She was sitting in a tree reading when a leopard bounded up behind her. Josephine threw the book and hit the leopard in the nose. Alicia finished it off.         In 1936, Josephine married Jay Frederick Reeve, a Chicago lawyer she met while covering the courts. At that time she operated a dairy and pig farm that became the Hawthorne-Melody Dairy, a major Illinois enterprise.         In the mid-1940's, after a divorce, she moved to Dubois, Wyo., bought a stallion from an Indian reservation and began raising horses.         In 1946, in Red Lodge, Mont., she married Ivan Albright, an artist of the Chicago school who was known for his realistic paintings. The couple traveled extensively, and Mrs. Albright's travels fostered her enthusiasm for geography.  Near the end of her life, she sponsored a statewide geography bee that was held  in every Vermont school district.         In 1949, Mrs. Albright returned to journalism for three years as the author of a weekly Newsday column, "Life With Junior," which chronicled her foibles and successes in rearing her four children.         In 1963, she and her husband moved to Woodstock, where she obtained a bachelor of arts degree from Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt.         Mr. Albright, whose centennial is to be observed next year with retrospectives at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, died in 1983.         After Alicia Patterson died in 1963, Mrs. Albright helped establish and became a major benefactor of the Alicia Patterson Foundation, which awards fellowships to print journalists and photographers.         Mrs. Albright was also a supporter of the Pentangle Theater in Woodstock, the River City Arts and White River Opera House in White River Junction, Vt., the Hood Museum in Hanover, N.H., and the Art Institute of Chicago. Dartmouth College named her a Lathrop Fellow in honor of her support for its arts collection.         Besides her daughter Alice, Mrs. Albright is survived by another daughter, Dinah Albright Rojek of South Woodstock, Vt.; two sons, Joseph Medill Patterson  Albright of Moscow and Adam Medill Albright of Richmond, Mass., 10 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.       
         Lois Shapiro, a publishing executive who helped handle best sellers like "The World According to Garp" by John Irving, "Faces at the Bottom of the Well" by Derrick Bell and "Passages" by Gail Sheehy, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. She was 57 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a form of bone marrow cancer, her family said.         She was director of publicity and advertising at E. P. Dutton from 1970 to 1982. She then joined Basic Books, a subsidiary of HarperCollins, as associate publisher, senior vice president and director of publicity and rights. She retired last September but remained a consultant.         She was born in Waterbury, Conn., and graduated from the University of Connecticut in 1960.         Ms. Shapiro is survived by her husband, Joel Belsky; a stepson, Peter Belsky  of Manhattan, and three brothers, Martin, of Norwich, Conn., Robert, of Miami, and Norman, o Kingston, R.I.       
         Elizabeth Clementine Miller Tangeman, a philanthropist and matriarch of a leading Indiana industrial family, died on Wednesday at her home in Columbus, Ind. She was 90.         At her death she was chairwoman of the Irwin-Sweeney-Miller Foundation of Columbus, a major regional donor to the arts, Christian education, social services, child welfare and community development. A family foundation, it reported grants of more than $1.65 million in the 1992 fiscal year.         In 1919, the Miller family founded the Cummins Engine Company of Columbus, which grew into the world's largest independent maker of diesel engines, with annual revenue of more than $4 billion and a payroll of more than 23,000. The company earned a national reputation for corporate good works, including paying  for renowned architects to design public buildings for Columbus, leading the town to style itself "the Athens of the prairie."         Born in Columbus, Mrs. Tangeman graduated cum laude from Smith College in 1927. She served as a trustee of Butler University, the Christian Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary.         She had a lifelong interest in Scouting and was a past director of the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. and a trustee of the World Foundation for Girl Guides and Girl Scouts. Her dedication to music led her to help establish the Institute of  Sacred Music at Yale University in 1973.         Mrs. Tangeman is survived by a stepson, John T. Tangeman of Kansas City, Mo.; a brother, J. Irwin Miller, the former chairman of Cummins Engine, and a stepgranddaughter. Her husband, Prof. Robert S. Tangeman, died in 1964.       
         Marcia Davenport, a biographer of Mozart and best-selling novelist, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Monterey, Calif. She was 92 and lived in Pebble Beach,  Calif.         Mrs. Davenport's last book was her autobiography, "Too Strong for Fantasy" (1967). In a review in The New York Times Book Review, Ellen Moers called it "a  compelling production" and said "the gift for old-fashioned, unadulterated romance which made several of her novels best sellers (and one a Greer Garson movie) does not fail her now." Mrs. Davenport did little writing after the 1970's.         Her best-known book is her biography "Mozart," which came out in 1932, and has been continuously in print since then, most recently from the University of  Pittsburgh Press.         When it appeared, Herbert Gorman praised it highly in The New York Times Book Review, writing that Mrs. Davenport "gives a vivid and convincing portrait of the child prodigy who developed into the man-genius, a portrait that does not romanticize Mozart too much and leaves the reader convinced of the reality of the figure with whom he has passed through a career of hard work, poverty, neglect and few (but astounding) triumphs."         Mrs. Davenport's best-known work of fiction was her best-selling 1942 novel "Valley of Decision," which covers the years 1873 to 1941 and focuses on Mary Rafferty, who comes into the lives of the Scott family of Pittsburgh, owners of the Scott Iron Works, as a maid. The book also weaves the Scotts' personal lives in with steel-industry and United States history. The book was made into a 1945 film, with the same title, starring Greer Garson and Gregory Peck.         Another of Mrs. Davenport's best-selling novels, "East Side, West Side" (1947), was one of the last works inspired and edited by Maxwell Perkins of Scribner's publishing house. The novel concerned a woman in Manhattan's high society whose marriage is threatened by her husband's infidelities. The 1949 film adaptation starred Barbara Stanwyck, James Mason and Ava Gardner.         Mrs. Davenport's first novel, "Of Lena Geyer" (1936), was recalled by one reviewer in the 1980's as a "a vivid portrayal of a great opera singer." Her last novel was "The Constant Image" (1960), which described an extramarital affair in Milan.         Her autobiography has vivid descriptions of music, even of the acoustics in Carnegie Hall years ago. In that book, she praises one particular box on the second tier at Carnegie Hall, saying "Carnegie Hall is glorious," but "nowhere else in the old house is the sonority so total, the instruments, together or individually, so brilliant and penetrating. The sound comes out of the walls and surrounds one like a cloak."         Marcia Gluck Davenport was a native New Yorker. In various biographical accounts, she refrained from giving her father's name. Her mother, Alma Gluck, rose from humble origins to fame as a soprano.         Mrs. Davenport wrote in her autobiography that her parents, whose marriage ended in divorce, "were part of the tidal wave of emigration from the Russian Pale and Eastern Europe which in a generation swept a million people, fleeing persecutions, pogroms and conscriptions, onto the shores of Manhattan Island."         Her mother later married the violinist Efrem Zimbalist. Young Marcia went to  private schools in Pennsylvania and attended Wellesley College. She was on the staff of The New Yorker from 1928 to 1931 before becoming a freelance lecturer,  music critic and commentator as well as an author.         Mrs. Davenport's first marriage, to Frank D. Clarke, ended in divorce, as did her 1929 marriage to Russell Wheeler Davenport, a novelist who became a prominent editor at Time Inc.         She is survived by a daughter, Cornelia Davenport Schwartz of Harrisville, N.H., six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Ursula C. Schwerin, former president of New York City Technical College and the first woman to head a technical college in the United States, died on Friday in a nursing home in Stamford, Conn. She was 71 and had been a longtime resident of Queens.         Her husband, Ernest Schwerin, said the cause was Alzheimer's disease.         Dr. Schwerin was born and reared in Berlin. In 1941, her family moved to the United States, where, she once said, they were considered "enemy aliens" and her father, a dentist, was unable to pursue his profession.         After high school, to please her parents, she went to college. But her first  exposure to higher education ended inauspiciously: she flunked out of Union Junior College in Cranford, N.J. "I simply wasn't ready for it," she later told  an interviewer.         At age 32, she decided to return to college; her choice this time was the school she later led, New York City Community College in downtown Brooklyn, part of the City University of New York. After completing a dental hygiene program in 1958, she did not stop her education. Working during the day and going to school at night, she received bachelor's and master's degrees, and a doctorate in human relations, from New York University.         She went on to become dean of instruction at the State University Agricultural and Technical College at Farmingdale, L.I. In 1978, she became president of the school everybody called CUNY Tech, 20 years after receiving her associate's degree there. Dr. Schwerin was the first woman to be named president of a City University community college and the second to be president  of any of the system's colleges, after Jacqueline G. Wexler of Hunter.         Dr. Schwerin fought for both money and respect for the college, which serves  a largely low-income, minority population. In 1980, it was recognized as a senior college in the CUNY system and renamed New York City Technical College. She retired in 1988.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her sister, Ruth Juretschke of Brooklyn.       
         Clare Lindgren Wofford, director of major gifts at American College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., died yesterday at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. A resident of Bryn Mawr, she was 69.         The cause was acute leukemia, her family said.         Mrs. Wofford, a magna cum laude graduate of the University of Minnesota in 1948, joined the staff of the college in 1985 as assistant to the president for  development.         She was earlier associated with Bryn Mawr College, where her husband, Harris  L. Wofford, was president in the 1970's. With her husband, who was a Democratic  Senator from Pennsylvania from 1991 through 1994, she was co-author of a book, "India Today" (John Day, 1951).         Over the years, she was also associated with the Katherine Gibbs School in Philadelphia, the University of Pennsylvania, where she was director of international seminars, and the Washington council of the African-American Institute.         In addition to her husband of 47 years, Mrs. Wofford is survived by a daughter, Suzanne Wofford of Madison, Wis.; two sons, Daniel, of Malvern, Pa., and David, of Washington, and four grandchildren.       
         Karen Machover, a psychologist who developed a method of personality analysis based on an interpretation of drawings of the human figure, died on Monday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.         Like the Rorschach inkblots, the Machover test is intended to serve as a sort of screen on which people project their thoughts, anxieties and conflicts. First, the test taker is told simply to draw a person. Next, the subject draws a figure of the opposite sex. Then a personality description is prepared from an analysis of such features as the figures' size, stance and position on the page.         Mrs. Machover wrote a book on her research that is still in print, "Personality Projection in the Drawing of the Human Figure: A Method of Personality Investigation" (Charles C. Thomas, 1949).         Born in Minsk, Belarus, Mrs. Machover came to the United States in 1910 with  her mother and four sisters. She worked for many years at Bellevue Hospital and  then at Kings County Hospital, retiring in 1970. She also maintained a private practice as a psychotherapist into the mid-80's.         In addition, she taught at Brooklyn College, SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and New York University, from which she had received her master's degree in psychology. It was at N.Y.U. in the 1930's that she met Solomon Machover, a student who became her husband. He died in 1976.         Mrs. Machover is survived by a son, Robert Machover of Milford, N.J., and a grandson.       
         Olga Havel, a human rights campaigner and wife of President Vaclav Havel, died on Saturday. She was 62.         Mrs. Havel died at her home here after suffering from cancer, the President's office said.         She was born in a Prague to a working-class family and met her husband, the  oldest son of a Prague industrialist impoverished by Communist nationalization in 1948, when he was a theater stage hand in the 1950's. They married in 1964.         Mrs. Havel was a signer of the Charter 77 human rights manifesto and worked in the dissident network led by her husband.         Charter 77, signed by intellectuals and others in January 1977, started a human rights offensive against Soviet control in what was then Czechoslovakia. Ultimately, it led to the formation of Civic Forum, a democratic movement that toppled Communist rule in 1989 and catapulted Mr. Havel, a dissident playwright, into the presidency in late 1989. Mrs. Havel later formed a committee known for  its charity work.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Dr. Elizabeth Monroe Boggs, a co-founder and past president of the Association for Retarded Citizens, died on Saturday at Cooper Medical Center in  Camden, N.J. She was 82 and a resident of Hampton, N.J.         She died of injuries sustained on Jan. 21 when she lost control of her car on an icy road near her home, said Dr. Deborah Spitalnik, a close friend and colleague.         Dr. Boggs, who became known around the country as the First Lady of the A.R.C., was active as a volunteer and advocate for four decades.  She served as  president of the organization in 1958, when it was known as the National Association for Retarded Children.         Since it was founded in 1950, the association, which now has its headquarters in Arlington, Tex., has grown to about 140,000 members, 46 state chapters and a  staff of 45. The membership consists of parents, professional workers and advocates for the mentally retarded, with the mission of promoting services, research, public understanding and legislation.         Dr. Boggs was the principal architect of Federal legislation that expanded the definition of disabilities to include people with physical handicaps. Previously, certain Federal programs served only people who were mentally retarded. She also helped develop legislation in Trenton that led to turning the New Jersey Division of Mental Retardation into the Division of Developmental Disabilities, again benefiting a broader population.         President John F. Kennedy named her to a Federal panel that studied the problems of mental retardation and advised on what action to take. The recommendations led to legisLation.         Dr. Boggs, who described herself as a "nonprofessional mover and shaker," was born in Cleveland and graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1935.         Her chosen field was theoretical chemistry. She went to England and received  a Ph.D. from Cambridge University. She began her career in World War II as a researcher at what is now Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh.         She married Dr. Fitzhugh Boggs, a fellow scientist, in 1941 and gave birth to their son, David, in 1945. It soon became apparent that David had sustained brain damage during a severe illness he suffered in infancy.         She took courses in special education and joined with other parents to organize on the county and then the state level. David's mental retardation left him with only limited use of his arms and legs, but Dr. Boggs and her husband tried to care for him at home. When they had to place him in a residential center in 1952, she made a hard choice between the laboratory coat and the mantle of public advocate.         Dr. Boggs is survived by David, a resident of the Hunterdon Developmental Center in Clinton, N.J. Fitzhugh Boggs died in 1971.       
         Suzanne Prou, a French novelist and militant opponent of anti-Semitism, died  in Paris, where she lived, during the night of Dec. 29-30. She was 75.         Le Monde reported her death on Tuesday, without giving its cause, and called  her "a novelist of bittersweet nostalgia."         Mrs. Prou (pronounced proo) wrote two dozen novels. The best known is "La Terrasse des Bernardini," or "The Bernardini Terrace," published in 1973. It won the Prix Renaudot, one of several French literary awards her works received.         Reviewing that book, William Cole wrote in the Saturday Review, "Madame Prou  weaves an incredibly fine net, the strands of which are passion, deceit, sadism, pride, seduction and burning hate." And the New Yorker said that she made "the charged atmosphere of decaying provincial life as fascinating as a drop of pond  water viewed through the lens of a microscope."         Her first novel, "Les Patapharis," which appeared in France in 1966 and was later published in English as "The Patapharis Affair," won the Prix Femina and was praised by Martin Levin in The New York Times Book Review as a "delicately shadowed work of art." Her last book, "L'Album de Famille," came out last year.         Mrs. Prou embraced a variety of causes during her life. During the German occupation of France she took a stand against anti-Semitism, helping to produce  an underground newspaper that denounced it. She was subsequently made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor.         Over the years, she was also an ardent feminist and supporter of human rights. In 1994, in a long program about AIDS that was broadcast on all French television channels, she gave a harrowing account of how her 26-year-old granddaughter, Erica, had died of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome the previous year.         The novelist was born Suzanne Doreau, the daughter of an army officer and a teacher, in a village near St.-Tropez on the French Riviera. She grew up partly  in Algeria and Indochina, pursued university studies in France -- in Marseilles  and Aix-en-Provence -- received a degree in literature in 1942 and was a schoolteacher for a time.         Her husband, Charles Prou, died earlier. They married in 1944 and had a daughter, Anne-Francoise.       
         Mary Averell Fisk, who championed early-childhood education in 45 years as a  volunteer in the New York City public schools, died on Saturday at her country home in Arden, N.Y. She was 78.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         The elder daughter of W. Averell Harriman, the former Governor of New York and Ambassador to the Soviet Union and Britain, Mrs. Fisk worked without fanfare through the New York City Volunteer Program, of which she was a founder, and the Public Education Association. The Volunteer Program seeks to identify and tutor  elementary school pupils who are having difficulty with reading and arithmetic.         Before her death, she was tutoring children at Public School 30 at Lexington  Avenue and 128th Street in Manhattan. For her volunteer efforts, the Y.W.C.A. of New York City cited her as Woman of the Year in 1983 and gave her its Elizabeth  Cutter Morrow Award, for women who have influenced the quality of life in New York.         Mrs. Fisk was one of the heirs who sued Pamela C. Harriman, now the Ambassador to France, whom her father married in 1971. The heirs charged that Mrs. Harriman squandered millions of dollars from their inheritance. Mr. Harriman, a railroad heir and financier, died in 1986. A settlement was announced last month, but the specifics of the deal were kept confidential.         Mrs. Fisk was born in Manhattan and graduated from Bennington College in 1939. She was a former trustee of Bard College and the American University in Beirut and served on the New York City Board of Education as a member for District 2 and the Advisory Board for Vocational and Extension Education.         She was also a member of the Palisades Interstate Park Commission, which oversees the park system's recreational offerings. She took a particular interest in its summer camps for children from the inner city, in conservation education and preservation projects intended to protect the system's thousands of acres of parkland.         She is survived by two sons, Robert C., of Washington, and Averell H., of Palm Beach, Fla.; a daughter, Kathleen F. Ames of Brookline, Mass.; a sister, Kathleen Mortimer of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren. Her husband, Dr. Shirley C. Fisk, died in 1979.         Correction:  January 17, 1996, Wednesday         An obituary last Wednesday about Mary Averell Fisk, who championed early-childhood education in 45 years as a volunteer in the New York City public schools, misstated the name of an organization she helped found. It is the New York School Volunteer Program, not the New York City Volunteer Program.       
         Helen Weil Benjamin, a longtime benefactor of the Mount Sinai Medical Center  and the Whitney Museum of American Art, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Mrs. Benjamin was a trustee of Mount Sinai Hospital from 1954 to 1979. A volunteer for the Mount Sinai Hospital Auxiliary Board from 1927 to 1991, she served as president for five of those years and was a founder of the hospital gift shop. She also established the Mrs. Robert M. Benjamin Educational Fund to  provide summer fellowships in gerontological social work.         She and her husband, a corporate lawyer, developed an interest in contemporary art that led to her involvement with the Whitney Museum. She served as a member of its Painting and Sculpture Committee from 1978 to 1989.         She was born in Manhattan, and graduated from Vassar College in 1925.         Mrs. Benjamin is survived by a daughter, Mary B. Arnstein of Hamden, Conn.; two sons, Robert M. Jr., of Manhattan and Stephen, of Santa Fe, N.M., seven grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Irene Arnold, a lawyer and teacher who spent her life in the service of the retarded and other victims of circumstance, like war and persecution, died on Jan. 4 at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan. A Clinton resident, she was 88.         Mrs. Arnold was the founder of Retarded Infants Services, a nonprofit agency  that she headed from 1956 to 1972. The Manhattan agency, which has since been renamed the Center for Family Support, provides services and volunteers to help  families keep seriously retarded and handicapped children in the home, a novel approach at the center's founding.         Mrs. Arnold later expanded services to find foster parents for children whose families could not care for them.         After leaving the agency in 1972, Mrs. Arnold worked for the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies. In 1977, she joined the New York State Department of Mental Retardation as a human-rights officer.         Finally, as a hearing officer, she listened to the "not in my backyard" objections from neighbors over the placing of group homes for the retarded. She  retired in 1980.         Irene Lowy was born on the Lower East Side and graduated from New York University. While teaching high school English, she attended Brooklyn Law School at night. With her law degree, she opened a small practice, but had little enthusiasm for cases of money-minded clients. She found her calling during the London Blitz in World War II, when she did the legal work that took hundreds of  children away from the air raids to safety in the United States on behalf of Eleanor Roosevelt's Committee for the Care of European Children.         She subsequently went to Europe working for the American Friends Service Committee, the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration and the Joint Distribution Committee. She joined teams of pediatricians and social workers who collected uprooted children and sent them to the United States.         She also rescued children from Buchenwald and recounted her experiences at the camps in a memoir in the collection of the Holocaust Museum in Washington.         Mrs. Arnold's husband, Dr. Newton Arnold, died in 1979. They had no children.       
         Jane Miller MacRae, an artist who wrote and illustrated children's books, died on Tuesday at her home in Hobe Sound, Fla. She was 89.         Best known under her maiden name, Jane Miller, she was the author and illustrator of books that often depicted animals in human settings. Her works included "Mogo Mouse" (1932), "Lulu" (1941), "Miss Lizzie" (1943) and "The Ill-Tempered Tiger" (1957).         Among the books she illustrated were "A Dog of His Own" (1941), "A Dance for Susie" (1953), "Andrew the Lion Farmer" (1959) and "Scrappy the Pup" (1960), by  the poet John Ciardi.         She had shows of her oil paintings in New York at the Sagittarius Gallery in  1959 and the Bodley Gallery in 1961.         She is survived by her husband, Cameron; a son, Cameron F. MacRae 3d, of New  York City, and two grandchildren.       
         Liz Williamson, a jazz dance authority, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Wonza Sinclair.         Ms. Williamson performed with Alvin Ailey's first company in 1958, dancing in the premiere of "Blues Suite," which started Ailey's choreographic career in  New York. She also danced with Donald McKayle and the Merry-Go-Rounders, and performed as a solo artist. She appeared on television, in films and in musicals, including City Center revivals of "Finian's Rainbow" and "Carmen Jones."         Ms. Williamson was born in Winston-Salem, N.C.She received a bachelor's degree in romance languages from Radcliffe College and a master's degree in dance from New York University. She wrote about the history of jazz dancing and  taught around the world, at schools and festivals that included the International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., in 1986 and 1990. In 1973, she was the first artist-in-residence at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, where she choreographed "The Many Faces of Jazz," a piece with a cast of 65 dancers. She continued to teach up until her death.         Ms. Williamson's husband, William Elliott Williamson, died in 1991.         In addition to her daughter, of Brooklyn, she is survived by a grandson.       
         Felice N. Schwartz, who was active for more than three decades in the advancement of women in the workplace, and whose writing focused debate over the career model known as the "mommy track," died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         She died of heart failure after a long illness, said her son Tony.         Mrs. Schwartz was the founder of Catalyst, a national organization that was  dedicated to helping women choose and advance careers and that later promoted the participation of women in corporations and their recruitment on corporate boards. She remained its president for 30 years, retiring in 1993.         She prompted a national debate in 1989 with an article in the Harvard Business Review that asserted it cost companies more to employ women than men. She noted that women's careers were often interrupted, or ended, when they had children and suggested that employers create policies to help mothers balance career and family responsibilities by giving them more flexibility in work hours and providing high-quality day care.         An uproar began almost immediately. Her proposed alternative career track came to be called the "mommy track." Detractors voiced the fear that by raising  the higher cost issue, women would not be hired and promoted and that all women  would be left with the primary responsibility for child care. Mrs. Schwartz said her views were widely misinterpreted.         "I violated the politically correct thing by saying that women are not just like men, " Mrs. Schwartz maintained in an interview in The Boston Globe in 1992. "What I said then and still say is that women face many, many obstacles in the workplace that men do not face. I was saying to that group of men at the top, 'Rather than let women's talents go to waste, do something about it.' "         She believed, she said, that there should be a parent track. "When a woman is faced with doing all the housework, all the child care and then full-time work in the corporate area, she is stunted. The same applies to men."         The daughter of Albert and Rose Nierenberg of New York, she first became involved in social causes while an undergraduate at Smith College. In 1945, she  founded the National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students. The organization lobbied colleges and universities to open their doors to minorities and provided financial aid for college bound African-American students.         Catalyst, founded in 1962 after Mrs. Schwartz had spent a decade at home raising her children, focused in its early years on lobbying employers to allow  women to combine family and part-time work. The organization pioneered several job-sharing pilot projects in which two women shared a full-time job. It also undertook studies on family issues in the workplace.         In 1968, Mrs. Schwartz wrote "How to Go to Work When Your Husband Is Against  It, Your Children Aren't Old Enough and There's Nothing You Can Do Anyhow." A second book, "Breaking With Tradition: Women and Work, the New Facts of Life," was published in 1992. Last month, she finished writing "The Armchair Activist:  Simple Yet Powerful Ways to Fight the Radical Right." It will be published this  fall.         She was married in 1946 to Irving L. Schwartz, a scientist, educator and physician.         During the early years of her marriage, Mrs. Schwartz and her husband had what might have been one of the early commuter marriages. The family moved to Cincinnati where Dr. Schwartz had been offered a post at a medical school. Mrs.  Schwartz, who was planning the organization that later became Catalyst, believed that it had to be launched in New York. She returned with her three children and Dr. Schwartz spent the next two years flying back and forth on weekends.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Cassie Arnold of Washington; two  sons, Tony Schwartz of New York City and James Schwartz of Boston; a brother, Theodore Nierenberg of Armonk, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Dorothea J. Steindl, who espoused Jewish causes for more than four decades, died on Monday at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y., of cancer. She was 71.         Mrs. Steindl was born Dorothea J. Kahn in Far Rockaway, Queens. In 1953, she  joined the Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training, which assists Jewish people around the world. She helped organize its White Plains chapter and was a vice president of the Westchester Region and a national board member.         Before the breakup of the Soviet Union, she lobbied for Jewish emigration from the country as a member of the Greater New York Conference for Soviet Jewry. More recently, she worked to help Jewish immigrants settle in New York.         Mrs. Steindl is survived by a daughter, Ethel J. Steindl of Manhattan, and her companion, Ira Adler of Scarsdale. Her husband, Emanuel Steindl, a Westchester real-estate developer, died in 1980.       
         Ruth Freeman Meyer, a philanthropist who attended Syracuse University's School of Management and remained a booster her whole life, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. A resident of Manhattan, she was 93.         Mrs. Meyer, who was born in Syracuse, upheld the notion that education makes  a difference in a young person's life by providing some of the financial wherewithal for it. She contributed to Syracuse University for decades, and in 1968 she established the Herbert and Ruth Meyer Endowment Scholarship Fund.         Steadily replenished, the fund has grown to $1.9 million and ranks among the largest individially financed scholarship programs at Syracuse. It provides full tuition, renewable for three years, for promising students from the New York City region, regardless of major.         She was on the board of the Council of Jewish Women and kept a continuing interest in the 92d Street Y.M.H.A. Fund. She also belonged to the Committee of  a Thousand, a support group active at Mount Sinai Hospital.         Mrs. Meyer's husband, Herbert, a New York businessman, died in 1968.       
         Judith Kaplan Eisenstein, an author, musicologist and composer, died yesterday of a heart attack in Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., where she was being treated for a broken hip. She was 86 and lived in Silver Spring, Md.         The oldest daughter of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist branch of Judaism, Dr. Eisenstein was the first woman to have  a bat mitzvah, in 1922.         No thunder sounded," she said in 1992, recalling the ceremony. "No lightning struck."         But opening to women the bar mitzvah rite that had long marked the passage of Jewish males into religious adulthood proved to be the first of many changes broadening the role of women in Judaism, including in recent years their ordination as rabbis.         Today the bat mitzvah ceremony, usually carried out when girls are 12, is an  established practice within the Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist branches of Judaism, and parallel celebrations are common in some quarters of Orthodox Judaism as well.         From 1929 to 1954, Dr. Eisenstein taught music education and the history of Jewish music at Jewish Theological Seminary's Teacher's Institute, now known as  the Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies in Manhattan.         While there she published a Jewish songbook for children, "Gateway to Jewish  Song," which was followed by other books of Jewish music and musical history for young people.  From 1942 to 1974, she wrote seven cantatas on Jewish themes, among them the frequently performed, "What Is Torah," which she wrote with her husband, Rabbi Ira Eisenstein.         In 1959, at the age of 50, Dr. Eisenstein, who had earned a master's degree in music education at Columbia University's Teachers College, began work for her Ph.D. at the School of Sacred Music of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of  Religion in New York. After receiving her degree, she taught there from 1966 to  1979, teaching as well at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia.         The smallest branch of Judaism, Reconstructionism views Judaism as what Dr. Eisenstein's father, Rabbi Kaplan, called the "evolving religious civilization of the Jewish people," emphasizing the cultural and moral heritage of the Jewish people but not traditional supernatural and theistic beliefs.         Dr. Eisenstein, who was born on Sept. 10, 1909, studied at the Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School. An early marriage ended in divorce and in 1934 she married Rabbi Eisenstein, the assistant rabbi at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, the Manhattan synagogue that her father headed.         She collaborated with her husband on five of her cantatas. In February 1952,  on the eve of a Jewish Music Festival in New York, Dr. Eisenstein defended the idea of a distinctive Jewish music. While Jews had borrowed much musically from  the nations and peoples they had lived among, she wrote in The New York Times, the music of Jews "bears the unmistakable stamp of their own peculiar wistfulness, puritanism, or wry humor."         When she was 82, 12 years past the biblical life span of 70, Dr. Eisenstein had a second bat mitzvah, at which she was also honored by feminist and Jewish leaders, including Betty Friedan, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Ruth W. Messinger, Elizabeth Holtzman, Rabbi Rachel Cowan and Blu Greenberg.         At that time, Dr. Eistenstein expressed disappointment that bat mitzvah ceremonies, like bar mitzvahs, were often overshadowed by lavish parties. "Bat mitzvah began not just as a statement of feminism," she said, "but as a statement of dedication to something larger than oneself."         In addition to her husband, Dr. Eisenstein is survived by two daughters, Miriam Eisenstein of Gaithersburg, Md., and Ann Eisenstein of Manhattan; three sisters, Hadassah Musher and Selma Goldman, both of Manhattan, and Naomi Wenner  of Chevy Chase, Md., and one grandchild.       
         Lady Caroline Blackwood, a writer of wry, macabre novels and essays, and a beguiling Anglo-Irish aristocrat who married the painter Lucian Freud and the poet Robert Lowell, died yesterday in the Mayfair Hotel in Manhattan, where she  stayed the last few weeks while she was ill. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Ivana Lowell.         She published nine books and was best known and much admired in Britain. Among her works was "The Stepdaughter," a short epistolary novel about an abusive woman abandoned by her husband and left with his hideous daughter. Another novel, "The Fate of Mary Rose," was about an increasingly deranged mother's fatal obsession with her daughter's safety.         Her most recent book, "The Last of the Duchess," was an eccentric, Kafkaesque account of her vain attempt to visit the ailing Duchess of Windsor. It revolved  mostly around the Duchess's powerful lawyer, Suzanne Blum, portrayed in the book as obsessed with her client to the point of erotic fantasy.         British critics noted the "brilliant irony" and "rather brilliant bitchiness" of her writing, comparing it with the work of Muriel Spark and Iris Murdoch, among others. In her prose and in person, she exhibited a razor-sharp wit and offbeat sensibility. A dramatic woman, delicately built, intense and vulnerable, she was a famous beauty in her youth, and in later years remained striking for her extraordinary eyes, which Mr. Freud made into giant spheres in his hypnotic  portraits.         One portrait played a curious role in her life, as she related in an interview last year. During the 1950's, when she and Mr. Freud were living in Paris, "Lucian got a call out of nowhere from a mistress of Picasso's who asked  him if he could come round and paint her," she said. "The woman wanted to make Picasso jealous. Lucian very politely said maybe he could paint her portrait later, but not now because he happened to be in the midst of doing his wife's portrait."         That picture, she said, was "Girl in Bed," a work that years later also figured in the death of Robert Lowell, her third husband. Their marriage was in  tatters when, the story goes, Lowell left her in Ireland and flew to New York City. When his taxi arrived at his apartment on West 67th Street, the driver found Lowell slumped over. A doorman summoned Elizabeth Hardwick, the writer and editor, whom Lowell had left to marry Lady Caroline; she happened to live in the same apartment house. Ms. Hardwick opened the taxi door to be confronted with her former husband's corpse. He was clutching "Girl in Bed."         Lady Caroli'e moved amo'g several worlds: from the insular Anglo-Irish upper  classes, which she largely rejected for the smart set of postwar England and then for the liberal intelligentsia of New York City in the 1960's and 70's. During much of the last 35 years, she lived in the United States, splitting her time in recent years between an apartment in Manhattan and a house in Sag Harbor, L.I., that once belonged to President Chester A. Arthur.         Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood was born in London on July 16, 1931.  She was descended on her father's side from the great 18th-century dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan and was a Guinness on her mother's side. (She liked to joke that she found stout undrinkable.) She grew up in the ancestral stone mansion, Clandeboye, in County Down in Northern Ireland.         Her great-grandfather, Lord Dufferin, was an eminent Victorian rumored to have been Disraeli's illegitimate son. Queen Victoria made him Viceroy of India, where he used to sit on his throne, fanned by peacock feathers. "Kipling loved my great-grandfather and wrote lots of very bad poems to him," Lady Caroline said. "He had a fatal effect on poets."         Her mother, Maureen, the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, is a flamboyant figure in London who, according to one newspaper account, gave a black eye to Sir Oswald Mosley, the English Fascist, after he made a pass at her in Antibes.  Her father, Basil, the Marquess, was a friend of Evelyn Waugh and part of the circle described in "Brideshead Revisited." He was killed in Burma during World  War II, when Caroline was 12.         Like other women of her class, she skipped college; she moved to London and worked for Claud Cockburn, the influential left-wing journalist. She recalled meeting Mr. Freud at that time at a party memorable because the painter Francis  Bacon caused a row when he hooted down Princess Margaret, who had just started singing "Let's Do It." She and Mr. Freud then became part of the group that included Bacon, Cyril Connolly and the other artists and writers who gathered nightly to drink at the Gargoyle and Colony Clubs.         When her marriage to Mr. Freud ended in 1956, she installed herself at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. She got a tiny part in the television series "Have Gun Will Travel." Stephen Spender asked her to write an article for Encounter magazine about California beatniks, and it was ' sendup that launched  her writing career.         She next moved to New York and married Israel Citkowitz, an American composer and pianist, and a student of Aaron Copland, 20 years her senior. They were divorced in 1972, when she married Lowell, but they remained close.         During the next years she endured a series of Job-like catastrophes: the death of Citkowitz; Lowell's crippling manic depression and early death; the death from AIDS of her brother, Sheridan, to whom she was very close; the death of her eldest daughter, Natalya, after a drug overdose, and her own bout with cervical cancer, for which she had an operation that left her in constant pain.         Throughout, she maintained her dark humor and creatively transformed her experiences into her novels and essays. "I think it's partly Irish," she once explained. "Irish people are very funny but have this tragic sense.         "As Cal wrote," she added, referring to Lowell, "if there's light at the end  of the tunnel, it's the light of the oncoming train."         In addition to her daughter Ivana, of Manhattan, she is survived by her mother, of London; a sister, Lady Perdita Blackwood, of Ulster; another daughter, Evgenia Citkowitz of Los Angeles, and a son, Sheridan Lowell of Manhattan.       
         Maria A. Rudzinska, a protozoologist who used electron microscopy to uncover  the eating habits of the parasite that causes malaria, died last Friday at her home in Manhattan. Dr. Rudzinska, who was an emeritus professor of parasitology  at Rockefeller University, was 92.         She came to Rockefeller in 1951, at a time when the use of the electron microscope in biology was in its infancy. She trained with the cell biologists Keith Porter and George Palade and then joined the laboratory of William Trager, a leading parasitologist.         It was in Dr. Trager's lab that she used the microscope to show that the malaria protozoa, a one-celled organism that enters the human body through mosquito bites, consumes red blood cells by ingesting portions of them into parts of its cell called vacuoles.         "It is a common way for cells to feed," said Dr. Trager, now an emeritus professor of parasitology at Rockefeller. "But no one had guessed that this was  the way malaria parasites feed."         Dr. Trager said her work also confirmed that the parasite entered the blood cell before eating it. "There was some controversy as to whether the parasite was inside the cell or not," he said. "At the level of the light microscope, it  was not easy to be sure."         Her research helped scientists find ways to treat the disease, he said.         The malaria parasite was not Dr. Rudzinska's favorite protozoa, however, Dr.  Trager said. That distinction fell to an organism called tokophrya. Unlike most  single-cell organisms, which live a rather mundane life restricted largely to dividing, tokophrya, she discovered, has specific life cycles.         "As a baby, it's a swimming little thing," Dr. Trager said. "But then it settles down, forms a stalk, and metamorphoses into quite a different-looking creature." It also has a reproductive cycle, and a period of old age.         "The thing she found was, if you give it a lot to eat, this process of aging  was greatly accelerated," Dr. Trager said. Overfed, tokophrya grew old faster and died earlier. The organism has been used by researchers who study the aging  process.         Dr. Rudzinska, who was so identified with the protozoa that she once received a post card at the laboratory addressed only to "Dr. Tokophrya," occasionally had difficulty finding specimens, which proliferate in fresh water ponds. After  one steady source on Long Island dried up, she found some closer to home -- in a fountain on the Rockefeller campus.         Dr. Rudzinska became an emeritus professor in 1975, but was still active in the lab. In her later years, she worked with Harvard researchers to discover how the bacterium that causes Lyme disease is carried by deer ticks.         She was born in Dabrowa, Poland, and earned advanced degrees in biology and zoology from the Jagiellonian University in Cracow. During World War II, she taught at the Jan Kazimierz University in Lvov, and participated in underground  teaching during the Nazi occupation.         After the war she came to the United States with her husband, Alexander Rudzinski, an international lawyer who was a member of the Polish delegation to  the fledgling United Nations. When the Communists took over the Polish Government, however, Mr. Rudzinski resigned, and the couple were granted asylum  in the United States.         Her husband died about five years ago.       
         Rita Lynn, an actress in radio and television who also helped develop the use of theatrical performances as therapy for psychiatric patients, died on Jan. 21  at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Frank Maxwell.         Ms. Lynn was best known for her work in television. Starting in the 1950's,  she appeared in a wide variety of roles on shows that included "Omnibus," "Playhouse 90," "The Phil Silvers Show," "Perry Mason," "The Streets of San Francisco" and "Maverick." She also had recurring roles on the soap operas "Search for Tomorrow" and "General Hospital." In radio, hers was a familiar voice in countless dramas.         Mq. Lynn's work as a volunteer nurse's aide at the Neuropsychiatric Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles in the 1950's led her to propose  a program of theatrical therapy. When the program was accepted, she spent five years producing and directing one-act plays with the institute's patients. She was asked to act as a consultant to other hospitals seeking to develop similar programs.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by children from two previous marriages: a son, Arthur Debernarde of Minneapolis, and a daughter, Donna Maria  Lynn of Westport, Conn.; a stepdaughter, Chris Maxwell of Los Angeles, and five  grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Clark, an author best known for the evocative range of her accounts of oystering in Brittany and of the streets of Rome, died on Friday at a retirement home in Boston. She was 82.         Miss Clark, the widow of Robert Penn Warren, was a master stylist whose works won critical acclaim and inspired a devoted private following. Her writings included reviews, essays, children's books and novels.         In a review in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard called a 1975 reissue of  her 1952 book "Rome and the Villa" "perhaps the finest book ever to be written about a city."         But the most telling tributes came from the generations of American and other tourists who followed her steps -- page by dogeared page -- through the city, marveling at each architectural feature that triggered her soaring ruminations on everything from ancient history and early Roman poetry to modern social conditions.         Although she was sometimes described as a travel writer, "Rome and a Villa" is not a traditional travel book. Nor is "The Oysters of Locmariaquer," a somewhat similar book that used oystering in Brittany as a springboard to an excursion through history and culture, and won the 1964 National Book Award for  arts and letters. Each reflected deep scholarship and a lively intuition.         Both in those books and in her norels, including "Baldur's Gate" (1970) and "Camping Out" (1986), Miss Clark seemed especially moved by landscape, an interest that was grounded in her childhood amid the rolling hills around Roxbury, Conn., her daughter, the poet Rosanna Clark, said yesterday.         Born in Los Angeles, Miss Clark was a descendant of early New England settlers. Her father was a mining engineer, and she seems to have inherited her  literary and scholarly bent from her mother, a Vassar graduate steeped in comparative literature.         Miss Clark also attended Vassar and spent much of her time during her college years on visits to Manhattan. She later became a conspicuous part of the city's  intellectual left, writing for The Partisan Review, The New Republic and The Nation. She was viewed as independent-minded with a youthful social conscience and regarded herself for a time as "a Trotskyite sympathizer."         During a trip to Mexico in 1937 she became a translator for Trotsky and was married to one of his secretaries for a brief time.         During World War II she worked for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, interviewing French and Italian diplomats. It was at a party at Katherine Anne Porter's home in the spring of 1944 that she met Mr. Warren, then in the last stages of an unhappy first marriage.         Although she recounted later that she had pursued him, once confiding that it had taken all her guile to get a simple good-night kiss, at the first meeting he seems to have been more taken with her than she with him.  She left the party with one of his friends, the poet Denis Devlin, and, as Mr. Warren later railed  in recounting the meeting to his children, "a bunch of other drunken Irishmen."         After their marriage in 1952, they traveled widely and found a formula for pursuing their separate literary careers. Working in different studies of the converted 17th-century barn that served as their home in Fairfield, Conn., they  wrote from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M. daily, she using the typewriter in the companionship of their cat, he writing in longhand accompanied by their dog.         When Miss Clark was stricken with macular degeneration and almost totally lost her eyesight (a setback described in "Eyes, Etc.," her 1977 memoir), her husband began reading to her at night. He died in 1989.         In addition to her daughter, of Needham, Mass., she is survived by a son, Gabriel, a sculptor, of Wood River Junction, R.I., and four grandchildren.
