         Katherine Kuh, a writer on art and a former curator at the Art Institute of Chicago who devoted her career to the acceptance of modern art, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died of natural causes, said her lawyer, William H. Roth.         Mrs. Kuh, the former Katherine Woolf, was born in St. Louis in 1904. She attended Vassar College and decided to focus on art history after taking a course taught by Alfred H. Barr Jr., soon to become the founding director of the Museum of Modern Art.         After graduate work at the University of Chicago and New York University, she opened Chicago's first commercial gallery of avant-garde art in 1936. For the next six years, she exhibited works by an impressive list of European and American modernists, including Leger, Kandinsky, Picasso and Klee, as well as African and pre-Columbian art, typographical design and photography. Sales were rare, so Mrs. Kuh kept the gallery afloat by holding art-history classes there. Innovative Exhibitions         In 1943, she was hired by Daniel Catton Rich, director of the Art Institute of Chicago, to run the museum's public-relations office while its regular director served in the military. She was soon put in charge of the museum's Gallery of Art Interpretation, where she mounted innovative exhibitions that introduced the public to modern art by comparing it to examples of art from other periods.         As associate curator of painting and sculpture at the institute, Mrs. Kuh worked with Rich to organize the first public exhibition of the great modern art collection of Mr. and Mrs. Walter Arensberg in 1949. In 1951, she published her first book, "Art Has Many Faces," one of the first books on the appreciation of modern art, and it was widely used by teachers.         In 1954, she became the Art Institute's first curator of modern painting and sculpture and, with Rich, was responsible for acquiring many of its most important works in this area, including Matisse's monumental figure painting "Bathers by a River."         In 1959, a year after Rich's departure, Mrs. Kuh left the Art Institute; soon she moved to New York. Over the next decade, she worked as art adviser for the First National Bank of Chicago, assembling an eclectic corporate collection of some 2,000 works that is considered one of the best in the country. During this period, her books included "The Artist's Voice" (1962), "Break-Up: The Core of Modern Art" (1965) and "The Open Eye: In Pursuit of Art" (1971).         Her marriage, to George Kuh, ended in divorce.       
         Louise Soelberg, a leading dancer with the Ballets Jooss, died on Jan. 5 at Greene Memorial Hospital in Xenia, Ohio. She was 90 and lived in Yellow Springs, Ohio.         Miss Soelberg trained in dance in her hometown, Seattle, at the Cornish School of Music and Art, a noted experimentalist center whose alumni include Merce Cunningham. She returned to head the dance department there after further studies with Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman and at the Jaques-Dalcroze Institute of Eurythmics in Geneva.         She established the dance department at Dartington Hall, an experimentalist center in Dartington, England, and joined Kurt Jooss's company in 1934, when it took up residence at the school after fleeing Nazi Germany. She left the company at the outbreak of World War II.         Miss Soelberg established the Dance Center, a training institution, in London and worked with Rudolf von Laban to develop his dance notation system, Labanotation. She taught dance at Catholic University in Washington, and created dances for the Martha's Vineyard Shaw Festival and the Empire State Music Festival.         Miss Soelberg's two marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by two daughters, Eloise Sharman of London and Jessica L. Andrews of Washington.       
         Joan Avnet, an art collector, dealer and philanthropist, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter Rosalind Avnet Lazarus.         Mrs. Avnet was the widow of Lester Avnet, founder of Avnet Inc., a distributor of electronics components. As collectors, the Avnets focused primarily on Old Master and Modern drawings, assembling major holdings in 20th-century drawings by European and American artists. Of the 900 works they acquired between 1960 and Mr. Avnet's death in 1970, 180 drawings were donated to the Museum of Modern Art in 1978.         Formed in consultation with the museum, the gift collection came to include theatrical drawings by Jim Dine, early drawings by Picasso and others by Jean Dubuffet, Lionel Feininger, Jackson Pollock, Emil Nolde, Egon Schiele and Leon Bakst. They also gave the museum drawings by Balthus, Chagall, Matisse, Modigliani and Rouault.  Other Gifts         The Avnets also made gifts to the Institute of Molecular Biology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, the Joan and Lester Avnet Division of Laboratories at the North Shore University Hospital and the Joan and Lester Avnet Chair in Ethics at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         In the 1960's Mrs. Avnet owned a gallery in Great Neck, L.I., and later was a private art dealer in New York and Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Avnet was born in New York and attended Hunter College. Her second marriage, to Dr. Karl Fischbach, ended in divorce.         In addition to Mrs. Lazarus, of New York and Washington, she is survived by another daughter, Carole Avnet Rocherolle of Stamford, Conn.; a son, Jonathan Avnet, a film director and producer of Topanga Canyon, outside Los Angeles, and eight grandchildren.       
         Esther Ralston, a silent-screen actress and vaudeville star who was known for a time as "the American Venus" for her starring role in the 1926 film of that name, died on Jan. 14 at her home in Ventura, Calif. She was 91.         The cause was a heart attack, said Jess L. Hoaglin, a friend.         Miss Ralston, who appeared in more than 150 films before and after the silent era, was born in Bar Harbor, Me., and came to Hollywood in 1916 with her parents. She was soon taking bit parts in Western films. An early appearance with Jackie Coogan in Charlie Chaplin's 1921 film "The Kid" won her the role of Mrs. Darling in a 1924 film adaptation of "Peter Pan." 'American Venus'         In "The American Venus," directed by Frank Tuttle, Ms. Ralston played a star-crossed contestant in the Miss America Pageant who is unable to compete after an automobile accident. Among her other films were "Beggars on Horseback" (1925), "Old Ironsides" (1926), "Children of Divorce" (1927) and "Betrayal" (1929), with Emil Jannings.         In the early 1930's, she made several pictures in Britain, including "Rome Express," opposite Conrad Veidt, and "After the Ball," with Basil Rathbone.         In 1933, she returned to Hollywood, and she acted in films for the rest of the 1930's. One of her last appearances was in "Tin Pan Alley" (1940), which starred Alice Faye. Ms. Ralston came out of retirement in 1961 to play the mother in a daytime soap opera on NBC, "Our Five Daughters." Later, she worked as an actor's agent and as a consultant for a lighting studio in Glens Falls, N.Y.         Ms. Ralston's three marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son, Ted Lloyd of Phoenix; a brother, Carleton Ralston of Los Angeles; two daughters, Judy Richmond of Mill Valley, Calif., and Mary Baxter of Phoenix; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Natalie Molostwoff, a former executive director of the School of American Ballet, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         The cause was cancer, said Nathalie Gleboff, the current executive director of the school, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet.         Ms. Molostwoff, whose original name was Natalie Merimanova, was a native of Baku, Azerbaijan, and emigrated to New York City with her mother when she was a girl. In later years, she became a secretary and was hired by the School of American Ballet in 1938.         Eugenie Ouroussow, the school's director at the time, soon discovered that Ms. Molostwoff possessed administrative skills. She became Ms. Ouroussow's assistant. When Ms. Ouroussow died in 1976, Ms. Molostwoff succeeded her as executive director, holding that post until she retired in 1991.         Ms. Molostwoff's first marriage ended in divorce, but she continued to use her married surname professionally.         She is survived by her second husband, the choreographer John Taras.       
         Hilda Simms, an actress best known for her starring role on Broadway in "Anna Lucasta," died on Sunday in Buffalo at the home of her sister Evelyn Sharp. She was 75 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer of the pancreas, her sister said.         "Anna Lucasta" and Ms. Simms's performance in the title role created a stir when the play, written by Philip Yordan and produced by the American Negro Theater, moved from Harlem to Broadway in 1944. For the first time, American playgoers saw an all-black cast acting in a drama that did not deal with racial issues. Ms. Simms played a middle-class woman who falls into prostitution and tries to fight her way back to respectability. The Road to Broadway         Ms. Simms, whose original surname was Moses, was born in Minneapolis.  She was one of nine children and studied teaching at the University of Minnesota until lack of money forced her to leave.         In 1943, Ms. Simms moved to New York. She acted in radio dramas and joined the American Negro Theater, where she was in charge of sound effects, props and publicity.         After appearing as a Southern ingenue in "Three's a Family," she was cast in "Anna Lucasta," a play written for white actors. Although most of the cast members were amateurs, the play received strong reviews and moved to Broadway. In 1947 Ms. Simms went with the play when it moved to London. While in Britain, she married the American actor Richard Angerolla. (Her first marriage, to William Simms in 1941, ended in divorce.)         Under the name Julie Riccardo, she also sang in Paris nightclubs before returning to the United States in 1953 to make the film "The Joe Louis Story." Her other film role was in "The Black Widow" (1954).         She also appeared in "The Cool World" (1960), "Tambourines to Glory" (1963) and a revival of "The Madwoman of Chaillot" (1970) in New York theaters. On television, she was in the series "The Nurses."         As the director of the creative arts program of the New York State division of human rights in the 60's, she focused attention on discrimination and the lack of roles for black actors in film and television. After earning a master's degree in education from City College, she worked for drug treatment programs in New York.         In addition to her sister Evelyn, she is survived by her husband, of Los Angeles; two brothers, Richard Ricco of Minneapolis and Emil Moses Jr. of Tucson, Ariz., and two other sisters, Laura Thompson of New Orleans and Rose Napue of Minneapolis.       
         Madelin Thayer Gilpatric, a volunteer for almost five decades for several nonprofit organizations in New York City and California, died last Thursday at New York Hospital. She was in her 80's.         The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage, according to her family.         Mrs. Gilpatric was a founder and past vice president of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center of New York City. She also served on the board of the California Institute of Arts in Valencia for 36 years and of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City for 17 years.         In addition, she worked with the Lighthouse for the Blind, the American Cancer Society, the Institute for Religion and Psychology and the International Press Institute.         Mrs. Gilpatric, a graduate of Syracuse University, was the widow of Arthur Kudner, whose advertising agency bore his name. Her marriage to Roswell Gilpatric, Deputy Secretary of Defense during the Kennedy Administration, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two brothers, Albert Thayer of Baldwin, L.I., and John Thayer of Norfolk, Va.; a son, Arthur Kudner of Grasonville, Md.; a daughter, Karyl McKay of Alanson, Mich., and six grandchildren.       
         Mary Woodard Lasker, the philanthropist and champion of medical research and urban beautification, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 93 years old and also had an apartment on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said her nephew, James W. Fordyce. She made her last public appearance at a luncheon at the Pierre Hotel in October.         As a patron and volunteer lobbyist, Mrs. Lasker furthered medical research on cancer, heart and eye diseases and in other fields. She also lent her support to beautification projects in New York and Washington that included planting trees and flowers and providing fountains and lighting. And she was a noted hostess and art collector.         In her later years she reduced her activities, but at her death she was still president of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, honorary president of the American Cancer Society and a trustee and vice chairman of the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Education Foundation.         In a 1958 speech, Robert Moses, then the Parks Commissioner, said Mrs. Lasker possessed "the irresistible combination Madison Avenue dreams of -- the blend of many essences in the beautiful package."         "Intelligence, vision, generosity, charm, kindness -- Mary has them all," Moses continued. Co-Founded Lasker Awards         Mrs. Lasker and her husband Albert Davis Lasker, a pioneer advertising executive who died in 1952, established the Lasker Foundation in 1942. In almost every year since 1944, it has given Albert Lasker Awards, largely for outstanding contributions to clinical and basic medical research.         The foundation has often been quick to recognize significant new research, and its awards have great prestige. Besides supporting medical research and health programs, it has also given its backing to efforts to beautify New York and to activities in the arts.         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served variously as chairman of the board of the American Cancer Society, a trustee of Research to Prevent Blindness and of the Cancer Research Institute and a director of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. She was also active in other similar organizations.         "I am opposed to heart attacks and cancer and strokes," she used to say, "the way I am opposed to sin."         In addition, Mrs. Lasker strove to persuade Federal, state and city officials and legislators to provide more funds for medical research on major killing and crippling diseases. She worked to persuade Congress to increase appropriations for the National Institutes of Health and to set up additional research centers concentrating on specific diseases.         "Without money," she said in 1985, "nothing gets done." To make sure things got done, she used to visit the White House (during Democratic Administrations, she added wryly). She also paid calls on Washington legislators, corresponded with Presidents and arranged for scientists to meet Government leaders. 'I Couldn't Cut Up a Frog'         Despite her successes in furthering medical research, Mrs. Lasker used to contend that she lacked scientific and medical aptitude. "Nobody would have me in their laboratory for five minutes," she once said, also with a smile. "I couldn't cut up a frog, and I certainly couldn't perform surgery. I'm better at making it possible for other people."         Her passionate interest in medicine was fueled partly by illnesses of people around her and by her own health; she repeatedly had ear infections during her Wisconsin childhood. Laskers Lead to Nobels         Over the years, the Lasker Foundation helped shape medical history by recognizing and supporting promising research, and it has repeatedly singled out future winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Fifty-one Lasker winners have become Nobel laureates.         For instance, the foundation's prize jury, whose longtime chairman is the heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chose two winners of 1985 Albert Lasker Medical Research and Public Service awards -- Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas, for their studies of cholesterol chemistry in relation to the clogging of coronary arteries. They were also named Nobel Prize laureates that year.         Commenting on Mrs. Lasker's efforts, Dr. DeBakey said in a 1985 interview: "Mary Lasker is an institution unto herself. Asking what her importance has been is like asking what Harvard has meant to this country."         Throughout their history, Lasker awards have been given in every year except 1960, 1990 and 1992. In early 1990, when it was announced that no awards would be given that year, the foundation had assets of about $2.4 million, down from about $4.5 million in 1980, but an executive of the foundation said that omitting the awards, of $15,000 each, in that year "wasn't really a financial decision." Since then, the awards have been increased to $25,000 each. 'Annie Appleseed'         Like her passion for medical research, Mrs. Lasker's interest in and patronage of urban beautification was long standing. In a 1953 column in The New York Times, Meyer Berger referred to her affectionately as "Annie Appleseed."         Her beautification activities included furnishing funds for tulips, daffodils, begonias, chrysanthemums and other flowers at various locations in New York. Her other urban beautification projects ranged from lighted Christmas trees to 300 Japanese cherry trees donated to the United Nations.         Mrs. Lasker acquired her interest in parks and gardens during her girlhood in Watertown, Wis., where she was born to Frank Elwin Woodard, a banker, and Sara Johnson Woodard, who was a founder of two parks there.         She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1923 and studied briefly at Oxford. Then she went to work for the Reinhardt Galleries, in Manhattan, where her duties were, as she later put it, "arranging benefit loan exhibitions of outstanding old and modern French masters and selling pictures to collectors and museums." An Art Collector         She also went on buying trips abroad and began building an art collection of her own, which included works by Miro and Renoir. She sold most of the collection years later when she changed Manhattan homes, partly, as she said, "because I wanted to be able to give away the money."         In 1940, after leaving the art-gallery world, she married Mr. Lasker, who had achieved wealth and eminence as an advertising executive, having joined the Lord & Thomas advertising agency in 1898 and become its owner in 1908.         Two years later, he retired from active business and the Lasker Foundation was set up. In addition, drawing on his own experience in public affairs, he encouraged Mrs. Lasker to press Washington to provide more funds for research in medicine. In the decades that followed, her efforts in that direction bore many fruits.         One notable success was the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. "The N.I.H. has flowered," Dr. DeBakey recalled in the 1985 interview, "because in many ways she gave birth to it and nursed it. It was in existence, but it was she who got the funding for it."         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served on the boards of trustees or directors of a number of organizations and institutions, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Museum of Modern Art, the Norton Simon Museum, New York University and Braniff Airways. Won Presidential Medal         She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1989, and other honors. A Health Sciences professorship at the Harvard School of Public Health was named for her in 1989, and a new variety of pink tulip was named for her in 1985.         Mrs. Lasker's first marriage, in 1926 to Paul Reinhardt, the owner of the Reinhardt Galleries, ended in divorce in 1934.         Her sister, Alice Fordyce, was the executive vice president of the foundation and director of the Lasker Awards program. She died in 1992.         In addition to her nephew, Mr. Fordyce of Greenwich, who is a trustee of the foundation, Mrs. Lasker is survived by a stepdaughter, Frances Lasker Brody of Los Angeles; a stepson, Edward Lasker of Los Angeles; three great-nephews; five step-grandchildren, one of whom, Christopher W. Brody of Manhattan, is also a trustee of the foundation, and two step great-grandchildren.         Funeral rites and burial are to be private. A memorial service is to be held in the spring.       
         Dinah Shore, a vivacious entertainer who was widely loved for her homey, heartfelt singing and breezy Southern charm, died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said Constance L. Stone, her publicity agent.         Miss Shore's career, which spanned more than 50 years, embraced radio, pop records and television, and reached its zenith in the 1950's and 60's when she appeared four times in a Gallup Poll of the most admired women in the world. Among her many honors were 10 Emmy Awards.         It was on "The Dinah Shore Chevy Show," a weekly television variety program that ran from 1956 to 1963, that she sang the jingle that would become her unofficial theme, "See the U.S.A. in Your Chevrolet." From 1970 to 1984, she was the host of several television talk programs, in which her vitality and relaxed rapport with celebrities from all walks of life established her as a forerunner of stars like Oprah Winfrey. A Friend of the Camera         "I don't know how to be afraid of that old red eye," she once said, referring to the television camera. "It's one person to me. I don't visualize large numbers of people out there. I'm comfortable with it."         Miss Shore, whose original name was Frances Rose Shore, was born on March 1, 1917, in Winchester, Tenn. She graduated from Vanderbilt University, where she majored in sociology. While in college, she made her radio debut with a 15-minute program on the Nashville station WSM. The theme song of that program was the 1925 hit song "Dinah," a name she adopted legally in 1944.         In 1938, Miss Shore came to New York, where she took a singing job with the radio station WNEW. The next year, she secured a two-week engagement singing with Leo Reisman's popular orchestra at the Strand Theater. In 1940, she began to build a national following as a performer on the NBC program "Chamber Music Society of Lower Basin Street" and on Eddie Cantor's program, where she was a regular guest for three years before starting her own program.         In 1940, she signed a recording contract with RCA Victor and had her first hits, "The Breeze and I" (with Xavier Cugat's orchestra) and "Yes, My Darling Daughter." These were the earliest of some 75 hit records she recorded between 1940 and 1955. Her 1942 recording of "Blues in the Night" sold a million copies and established her as a sultry blues-tinged balladeer in the tradition of Ethel Waters and Mildred Bailey. 'I'll Walk Alone'         She had her first No. 1 hit in 1944 with "I'll Walk Alone," a quintessential World War II song of longing. Among her other major hits were "The Gypsy" (1946), "The Anniversary Song" (1947), "Buttons and Bows" (1948) and "Dear Hearts and Gentle People" (1949).         "Buttons and Bows" became the most popular in a long line of novelty hits she recorded, trading on her down-home image and Southern drawl. Other such songs were "Shoofly Pie and Apple Pandowdy" and "Pass the Jam, Sam."         The success of "Blues in the Night" led to roles in several movies, including "Up In Arms" (1944) and "Till the Clouds Roll By" (1946). But her movie career was short-lived (she appeared in only seven pictures), and she quickly returned to radio and a new recording contract with Columbia. In an interview in 1981, Miss Shore said she felt she had "bombed" as a movie star. "I'm just not photogenic," she said.         But the charm and vitality that somehow eluded the movie cameras made her one of television's biggest stars for three decades. Much more than her singing, it was her personality -- direct, unpretentious and enthusiastic -- that made her into a symbolic Everywoman of the 1950's and 60's. 1951 Start on TV         She started on television in 1951 with "The Dinah Shore Show," a 15-minute musical program. Then, with the more elaborate "Dinah Shore Chevy Show" in 1956, she became one of the few female entertainers to have long-term success as the host of a television variety program.         In the 1970's, Miss Shore switched from musical variety to talk programs with "Dinah" (1970-74), "Dinah's Place" (1974-79) and "Dinah and Friends" (1979-84). More recently, a weekly cable-television show, "A Conversation With Dinah,' ran from 1989 to 1991 on the Nashville Network, for which she also was the host of specials with Eddy Arnold and Burt Reynolds.         Miss Shore was married twice. Her 1943 marriage to the movie star George Montgomery ended in divorce in 1962. A second marriage, in 1963, to Maurice F. Smith, a professional tennis player, lasted less than a year. During the 1970's, Miss Shore had a six-year relationship with Mr. Reynolds that was highly publicized because she was nearly 20 years older than he.         Miss Shore, a sports enthusiast, played tennis and golf and sponsored a professional golf tournament, the Dinah Shore Classic, in the Palm Springs, Calif., area for more than two decades. She was also the author of three cookbooks, including the best-selling "Someone's in the Kitchen With Dinah."         She is survived by a daughter, Melissa Ann Hime; a son, John David Montgomery, and three grandchildren.       
         Sally Belfrage, who wrote nonfiction books about life in an Indian ashram and about the civil rights movement in Mississippi in 1964, died yesterday at Middlesex Hospital in London. She was 57 and lived in London.         The cause was cancer, said her literary agent, Irene Skolnick.         Ms. Belfrage (pronounced BELL-fridge) spent a month studying under an Indian spiritual leader to gather material for "Flowers of Emptiness: Reflections on an Ashram" (1981). The book won her praise as an intelligent and humorous journalist and critic who ardently searched for the truth.         Her Mississippi memoir, "Freedom Summer" (1965), based on her experience as a civil rights volunteer, was lauded for freshness and forcefulness.         Her other books are "A Room in Moscow" (1959), about a sojourn in the Soviet Union and "Living With War: A Belfast Year" (1987). "Un-American Activities," a memoir of her adolescence, is to be published in June by HarperCollins. Youth in Hollywood and London         Ms. Belfrage was born in Hollywood, the daughter of Cedric Belfrage and Molly Castle, Britons who were then correspondents for London newspapers. In "Un-American Activities" she wrote, "My mother was a mere English eccentric, but my father was a Red and so in trouble all the time."         After her family moved east, she attended Bronx High School of Science, Hunter College and, after moving to London when she was 18, the London School of Economics. In 1957, she worked for the Foreign Languages Publishing House in Moscow.         Her 1965 marriage to Bernard Pomerance, who wrote the play "The Elephant Man," ended in divorce in 1976.         She is survived by a daughter, Eve Pomerance of London; a son, Moby Pomerance of Manhattan; a brother, Nicholas, of London, and a sister, Anne Zribi of Paris.       
         Mai Zetterling, the Swedish actress who went on to a career as one of Europe's busiest female film directors, died on Tuesday in London. She was 68 and had homes in London and in Banne, France.         The cause was cancer, said her agent, Joyce Edwards.         Ms. Zetterling was directing the film "The Woman Who Cleaned the World," which she had written, when she died.         Mai Elisabeth Zetterling was born in Vasteras, Sweden, to a working-class family. She left school barely literate, according to her 1985 autobiography, "All Those Tomorrows."         After working in a drug store and a mail-order company, she tried acting and was invited to join the Royal Dramatic Theater School in Stockholm. She made her stage and screen debuts when she was 17. Breakthrough in 'Torment'         Her sensitive portrayal of a simple girl victimized by a sadistic professor in "Torment" (released in the United States in 1947), created a sensation and is now considered a landmark of the Swedish cinema. The film, directed by Alf Sjoberg and written by Ingmar Bergman, was released under the title "Frenzy" in England and made her an international star.         She also appeared in "Frieda" (1947), "Desperate Moment" (1953), "Knock on Wood" with Danny Kaye (1954), "A Prize of Gold" with Richard Widmark (1955), "Abandon Ship!" with Tyrone Power (1957), "Only Two Can Play" with Peter Sellers (1961), "The Vine Bridge" (1965), "The Witches" (1990) and "Hidden Agenda" (1990).         In the 1960's and 1970's she was one of the few women who found regular work as a director. Her first effort, "The War Game" (1963), a short documentary, won a first prize at the Venice Film Festival in 1963. Many of her subsequent films dealt explicitly with female sexuality and focused on the role of women in society.         Among her directorial credits are "Loving Couples" (1964), "Night Games" (1966), "Doctor Glas" (1968), "The Girls" (1969), "Vincent the Dutchman" (1975), "Lady Policeman" (1979), "Of Seals and Men" (1979) "Scrubbers" (1983) and "Amorosa" (1986).         In later years she continued acting, co-starring with Anjelica Huston in Nicholas Roeg's 1990 film "The Witches."         Ms. Zetterling also wrote children's books, short stories and novels, one of which, "Night Games," she adapted and directed for the screen.         Her two marriages, to Tutte Lemkow, a Norwegian dancer, and the novelist David Hughes, ended in divorce. She is survived by a son and a daughter from her first marriage.       
         Estelle Sommers, the administrator and joint owner of the nationwide Capezio Dance-Theater Shops and an arts patron who advised many important dance groups, died on Monday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Gayle Miller.         Mrs. Sommers was the widow of Ben Sommers, the dance philanthropist and head of Capezio Ballet Makers, the theatrical shoe company. Until his death at the age of 78 in 1985, she often collaborated with him on arts and business projects. In addition to administering the Capezio shops across the country, Mrs. Sommers owned and managed the Capezio Fashion Shop in New York City from 1964 to 1975.  Active in Organizations         Mrs. Sommers was best known in the dance world for the energetic way she championed a wide variety of causes and organizations in the United States and abroad. In 1988, she joined the overseers board of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., which named a studio in honor of her and her husband. Since 1979, she served as the United States chairwoman of the International Committee for the Dance Library of Israel, which presented her with its documents of dance award last year.         She was also on the board of the Dance Notation Bureau (and was the recipient of its annual award in 1991), the America-Israel Cultural Foundation, the Center for Dance Medicine, the International Ballet Competition U.S.A., the International Dance Alliance, the Joffrey School of Ballet, the Harkness Center for Dance Injuries, the Israeli Dance Institute and the Yard, a summer choreographic workshop on Martha's Vineyard.         Mrs. Sommers was a native of Baltimore. She entered the business world in 1947 when she converted a retail store in Cincinnati into a dance-supply business. She moved to New York City in 1962, the year she married Mr. Sommers; a previous marriage ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Miller, who is the president of Capezio Dance-Theater Shops, she is survived by two other daughters, Cathy Rano, vice president of Federated Department Stores, and Debbie J. Palmer; five grandchildren; four step-grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.         Funeral services will be held at noon today at the Central Synagogue, 123 East 55th Street, Manhattan.       
         Lili Damita, a French-born actress who became one of Hollywood's most glamorous celebrities in the early years of talking pictures, died on Monday in Good Samaritan Medical Center in Palm Beach, Fla. She was thought to be about 90, and she lived in Palm Beach.         She had Alzheimer's disease, The Associated Press reported.         Miss Damita was born in Paris. She spoke five languages and was filming in Berlin when Samuel Goldwyn brought her to Hollywood in 1928 to star with Ronald Colman in Joseph Conrad's "Rescue." A review in The New York Times noted that Miss Damita "is fascinatingly handsome and gives an intelligent performance" in a difficult role. Marriage and a Retirement         Over the next seven years she was seen in more than a dozen films, and the press chronicled her comings and goings, her rumored or real love affairs and every change of hairdo. Her career ended abruptly when she married Errol Flynn, a dashing newcomer to Hollywood, in 1935. She retired from acting and stayed retired after the marriage ended in 1942.         After "The Rescue" she starred in Thornton Wilder's "Bridge of San Luis Rey" (1929). She played opposite Victor McLaglen in "The Cock Eyed World" (1929); Gary Cooper in "Fighting Caravans" (1931); Adolphe Menjou, Laurence Olivier and Erich von Stroheim in "Friends and Lovers" (1931), and Jack Buchanan in "Brewster's Millions" (1935).         Her last film paired her with James Cagney in the "Frisco Kid." She also appeared on Broadway, making her stage debut in "Sons o' Guns" in 1930 with Goldwyn's permission. She starred with Bert Lahr and Eleanor Powell in "George White's Music Hall Varieties," a 1932 vaudeville show. Dancing and Singing         Miss Damita, whose name was originally Liliane Carre, spent much of her childhood at convents in Portugal, Spain and Greece, and she studied dancing in Belgium. As a teen-ager, she danced and sang for the troops in World War I. She then danced with the Paris Opera and, at 19, succeeded Mistinguette as star of the Casino de Paris Revue.         Miss Damita -- the name means little lady in Spanish -- had a son with Mr. Flynn, Sean, who was a photojournalist and who disappeared in Cambodia in 1970. Her second marriage in 1962 to Allen B. Loomis, an Iowa manufacturer, also ended in divorce.       
         Lynn Solotaroff, a translator from Russian and a teacher, died on Monday at the Jewish Home & Hospital in New York. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer and emphysema, her family said.         Mrs. Solotaroff was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from the University of Michigan and studied Russian as a graduate student at the University of Chicago and Columbia University. At Columbia she became a visiting scholar at the Russian Institute -- now Harriman Institute -- and worked as its director of publications from 1977 to 1985.         Among the books she translated was Tolstoy's "The Death of Ivan Ilyitch" (1981). She also contributed to Avraham Yarmolinsky's translation of "Letters of Anton Chekhov" (1973), and most recently was working on her own edition and translation of Chekhov's stories.         For the last several years she also taught English as a second language at City College and Touro College.         Mrs. Solotaroff is survived by two sons, Paul, of Boston, and Ivan, of Manhattan; and two sisters, Bernice Silverstein of River Edge, N.J., and Sydelle Corwin of Potomac, Md. Her marriage to Ted Solotaroff ended in divorce.       
         Claire Nichtern, who produced or helped to produce several dozen Broadway plays and musicals in her theatrical career, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Judith Nichtern.         From 1979 to 1985 Ms. Nichtern was president of Warner Theater Productions, a division of Warner Communications. During that period she produced over 30 plays and musicals for Warner, among them "Crimes of the Heart" by Beth Henley, which won a Pulitzer Prize.         In 1955 Ms. Nichtern took an aptitude test that suggested that theater production would be a good field for her talents. She accepted a job as a receptionist at the Phoenix Theater in Greenwich Village and rose quickly to casting director.         In the early 1960's she helped in the production of two short plays, "The Typist" and "The Tiger" by Murray Schisgal, starring Eli Wallach and Anne Jackson, at the Theater de Lys. The production was an immediate success.         In 1965 Ms. Nichtern won the Tony Award as best producer of a drama for her Broadway production of Mr. Schisgal's comedy "Luv," directed by Mike Nichols and starring Mr. Wallach, Ms. Jackson and Alan Arkin. Among her other productions of the 1960's and 1970's were "The Banker's Daughter," "Jimmy Shine," "Cold Storage," "House of Blue Leaves," "Absent Friends" and "I Got a Song."         Ms. Nichtern's two marriages ended in divorce.         She is survived by her daughter and a son, David, both of Manhattan.       
         Dr. Kathryn Frederick Clarenbach, a founding member and the first chairwoman of the National Organization for Women, died on Friday at her home in Madison, Wis. She was 73.         The cause was complications from emphysema, her family said.         Dr. Clarenbach, known as Kay, was professor emeritus of political science at the University of Wisconsin, where she earned her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in that subject. She taught in Indiana, New York and Michigan before returning to Madison to teach at the University of Wisconsin and Edgewood College. She retired in 1988.         A native of Sparta, Wis., she worked for many years on the university's program of continuing education for women. For 13 years, she headed Wisconsin's Commission on the Status of Women, helping to shape changes in the laws on sexual assault, divorce and marital property.         On the national level, she was an organizer of the National Women's Political Caucus. In 1966, she was a founder of NOW and led it with Betty Friedan, the organization's first president, until 1970.         Dr. Clarenbach is survived by two daughters, Sara Clarenbach of Madison, and Janet Mallon of Oswego, N.Y.; a son, David, of Madison, and one grandson.       
         Lil Picard, an artist and critic whose activities included painting, collage, film and performance as well as a stint as a designer of women's hats, died on Tuesday at her home. She was 94 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of natural causes, said Jon Hendricks, a friend.         Ms. Picard was born Lilli Elizabeth Benedict in Landau, Germany, in 1899. After graduating from high school in Strasbourg, now in France, she studied art and literature in Berlin. She remained in Berlin, where she worked as a journalist and was friendly with members of the Berlin Dada group, including Richard Huelsenbeck, George Grosz, Emmy Hennings and Hugo Ball. In 1937 she moved to New York City and worked for a while as a hat designer, opening a millinery boutique at Bloomingdale's in 1942.         Ms. Picard began painting in 1939 and by the late 1940's was exhibiting paintings and collages in the 10th Street galleries. By 1960 she was making reliefs and tablets that often had an autobiographical, feminist focus. In the 1960's and 70's she became known for interactive performances and environments, which often occurred under the auspices of the New York Avant-Garde Festival. Her 1967 performance, "Construction-Destruction-Construction," at the Judson Church Gallery, was filmed by Andy Warhol.  One-Person Shows         Ms. Picard's first one-person show was at the David Anderson Gallery in 1960. In 1976 she had simultaneous exhibitions at Goethe House, the Ronald Feldman Gallery and the Holly Solomon Gallery in New York, and, in 1978, a retrospective at the Neue Berliner Kunstverein in Berlin.         Beginning in the early 1970's, Ms. Picard wrote on art for Interview and the East Village Other and was New York art correspondent for Kunstform International and Die Welt.         Ms. Picard's first marriage, to Fritz Picard, an antiquarian bookseller, ended in divorce in the late 1920's. In 1935 she married Hans Odell, a banker, who died in the late 1970's.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Louise Troy, a tall and elegant actress who was praised for performances in Broadway musicals, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60.         The cause was breast cancer, said Larry Keith, a friend.         Miss Troy was applauded for what critics called her sprightly, winning, handsome and vivid performance as Edward Woodward's impatient second wife in the 1964 musical "High Spirits," based on Noel Coward's comedy "Blithe Spirit."         "I lose three pounds a performance," she told an interviewer at the time, and her efforts won her a Tony Award nomination.         Miss Troy also received Tony nominations for her acting in the 1963 musical "Tovarich" and the 1966 musical "Walking Happy."         She had already won recognition for her acting in a 1954 production of Jean Cocteau's play "The Infernal Machine." One critic said she was able to take a classical play in stride without the solecisms familiar in the work of amateurs trained only for realism. Rarely Idle         From 1974 through 1980, Miss Troy had starring roles in a dozen plays, including Coward's "Private Lives" and Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya." She also appeared in regional theater over the years.         In addition, she appeared in a number of television series, including "The Defenders," "Hogan's Heroes," Room 222," "The Odd Couple" and "Kate and Allie." She also acted in the 1968 films "Yours, Mine and Ours" and "The Swimmer."         Miss Troy, who was born in Manhattan, studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and with Lee Strasberg.         Her 1969 marriage to Werner Klemperer, an actor, ended in divorce in 1974.         She is survived by her second husband, Douglas Seale, who is an actor and stage director.         A funeral service is scheduled for Monday at 11 A.M. at Grace Church, Broadway and 10th Street in Manhattan.       
         Herva Nelli, an Italian-born soprano who became a professional cook when her singing career ended, died yesterday at the Sharon Country Manor in Sharon, Conn. She was 85.         Her sister, Delfa, said the cause was leukemia.         Miss Nelli, a solid, able singer who was often called "the Toscanini soprano" because of her seven-year association with the conductor, was reared in Pittsburgh and made her debut in 1937 with the Salmaggi Opera in New York City. In 1947, after she sang in a concert version of "Otello" with Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times that the timbre and quality of her voice "most touchingly communicated Desdemona's gentleness and purity of soul."         Over the next seven years she sang with the orchestra in several Verdi operas and went to Italy with Toscanini for the postwar reopening of La Scala opera house.         She made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1953 in "Aida" and sang many leading roles there. Her final performance was in 1962, in "Norma" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.         Miss Nelli and her husband opened a restaurant near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in 1955. In 1970, after their divorce, she started to cater meals for a country club, then became a cook for Stephen and Jean Kennedy Smith.  She is survived by her sister, of Wingdale, N.Y.       
         K. T. Stevens, a theater, film and television actress and a theatrical-union official, died on June 13 at her home in Brentwood, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was lung cancer, said Dick Moore, a spokesman for the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists.         Ms. Stevens, whose original name was Gloria Wood, was born in Hollywood. Her father was the film director Sam Wood. She began acting in plays and films as a child, using the stage name Katherine Stevens. After starring in the radio soap opera "Mr. Pepper's Family" and taking ingenue roles on the stage, she made her Broadway debut in "The Land Is Bright" in 1941. She also appeared on Broadway in "Nine Girls" (1943) and "Laura" (1947).         In the 1940's and 50's Ms. Stevens played leading roles in such films as "Address Unknown" (1944), "Port of New York," (1949), "Harriet Craig" (1950) and "Vice Squad" (1953). More recently, she appeared in "Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice" (1969) and "Pets" (1974).         Her television credits include appearances on "I Love Lucy," "The Rifleman," "The Patty Duke Show" "Mannix," "Days of Our Lives" and "General Hospital." For more than five years she played Vanessa on "The Young and the Restless."         Ms. Stevens served on local and national boards of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists from 1978 until her death. She was president of the union's Los Angeles local from 1986 to 1989.         Her marriage to the film actor Hugh Marlowe ended in divorce in 1967. She is survived by two sons, Jeffrey and Chris, both of Los Angeles, and a granddaughter.       
         Fredi Washington, one of the first black actresses to gain recognition for her work on stage and in film, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford, Conn., where she lived. She was 90.         The cause was pneumonia, which developed after a stroke, said her sister, Isabel Powell.         Miss Washington's best-known performance was as the young mulatto who passes for white in the 1934 film "Imitation of Life." Her performance was so convincing that she was accused of denying her heritage in her private life.         "She did pass for white when she was traveling in the South with Duke Ellington and his band," said Jean-Claude Baker, a restaurateur and author and a friend of Ms. Washington's. "They could not go into ice-cream parlors, so she would go in and buy the ice cream, then go outside and give it to Ellington and the band. Whites screamed at her, 'Nigger lover!' " Danced With Josephine Baker         Miss Washington, whose given name was Fredricka, was born in Savannah, Ga., on Dec. 23, 1903. She made her first cabaret appearance in New York at 16 as a member of the Happy Honeysuckles hired by Josephine Baker, Mr. Baker's foster mother, and was a chorus girl in the musical "Shuffle Along" in 1921. While performing at the Club Alabam in Manhattan, she was noticed by the producer Lee Shubert, who recommended her for the co-starring role opposite Paul Robeson in the play "Black Boy" (she played the role under the stage name Edith Warren).         At the end of the run, with no serious productions for black actors in view, she turned to dancing and toured Europe with her dance partner, Al Moiret.         When she returned to the United States, she appeared in such stage productions as "Run, Little Chillun," "Great Day," "Singing the Blues," "Mamba's Daughters," "Lysistrata" and "A Long Way From Home" (an all-black production of Gorky's "Lower Depths"). Her film work included roles in "The Emperor Jones," "Black and Tan Fantasy," "Drums in the Night" and "One Mile From Heaven."         Miss Washington worked for equal rights for blacks in the theater and film industry and was a founder of the Negro Actors Guild. She also was a drama editor and columnist for The People's Voice, a New York weekly newspaper published by Adam Clayton Powell Jr., her sister's husband at the time.         Miss Washington's marriage to Lawrence Brown, a trombonist in the Duke Ellington Orchestra, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Dr. Anthony H. Bell, died in the early 1980's. In addition to Mrs. Powell, of New York City, she is survived by two other sisters, Rosebud Smith of Jamaica, Queens, and Gertrude Penna of Orlando, Fla., and a brother, Floyd Washington of Hempstead, L.I.       
         Dorothy Collins, a singing star of the popular 1950's television show "Your Hit Parade" and a Tony nominee for the Broadway show "Follies" in 1971, died on Thursday at her home in Watervliet, N.Y. She was 67.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Melissa Holgate.         As a featured singer on "Your Hit Parade" from 1950 to 1957, Miss Collins was America's singing sweetheart, noted for her trademark high-necked blouses and such standard songs as "Too Young," "Shrimp Boats" and "Harbor Lights." The show was the television version of the long-running radio program "Lucky Strike Hit Parade" and featured the top tunes of the week performed by the show's cast in a variety of costumes and settings. Other members of the cast during Miss Collins's time included Snooky Lanson, Gisele MacKenzie, June Valli and Russell Arms.         Miss Collins, whose original name was Marjorie Chandler, was born on Nov. 18, 1926 in Windsor, Ontario. Her first career thoughts were for secretarial work, but when her parents entered her in a talent show in 1938, she won a wristwatch and a chance to sing on a children's radio program in nearby Detroit. She was such a hit that she stayed with the show for some time. Met Her Mentor at 16         In 1942, she was introduced to the band leader Raymond Scott, who advised her to take voice lessons for a year and then to sing for him again. She subsequently sang with his quintet and performed in jazz spots across the country. In 1949, Mr. Scott left his group to become director of the orchestra for the radio show "Your Hit Parade," and Miss Collins stayed on the road and ran the quintet. That meant doing the introductions as well as singing. Speaking Mr. Scott's lines, she was actually doing her first announcing.         "It was quite a terrifying experience," she said in a 1953 interview, but it took her closer to the earnest commercials that were to contribute to her fame.         She and Mr. Scott were married in 1952.         Early in 1950, the American Tobacco Company, sponsor of "Your Hit Parade" for Lucky Strike cigarettes, was looking for a new type of advertising commercial. Mr. Scott was commissioned to write some jingles, which eventually gained nationwide popularity, and he had Miss Collins sing them. The sponsor liked her voice and personal appearance and when televising "Your Hit Parade" was broached, she was selected for four trial telecasts. Impressed by this cheerful woman who told people to get happy by smoking a particular cigarette, the sponsor signed her to do the commercials and to be a featured singer when the show began its official run in October 1950. Letters From the Clergy         In a 1979 interview, Miss Collins was asked if she liked her girl-next-door image.         "Yes, because that's me, and you can't be what you aren't," she replied. "I was very protected when I was growing up, and there's a lot that I don't know. When I was on 'Hit Parade,' the bulk of my mail was from priests and nuns. They used to do sermons on all the good I was doing for American womanhood."         After "Your Hit Parade" went off the air, she did a stint on "'Candid Camera," from 1961 to 1963. In 1971 she was given a starring role in the Stephen Sondheim musical "Follies," singing one of the show's big songs, "Losing My Mind" and receiving a Tony nomination for her performance. She also had leading roles in stock companies and dinner-theater productions and gave concerts across the country. Plagued with asthma for years, she retired from performing in 1980.         She was also active for many years in the Muscular Dystrophy Association, and became a vice president of the organization in 1988.         Her two marriages, to Mr. Scott and to the singer Ron Holgate, ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Holgate, who lives in Watervliet, she is survived by two other daughters, Elizabeth Adams, also of Watervliet, and Deborah Studebaker of Los Angeles, and five grandchildren.       
         Nina Stroganova, a Danish-born ballerina who was a founding member of American Ballet Theater and who became a noted dance teacher in New York City, died on Tuesday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was leukemia, said her daughter, Ludmilla Dokoudovsky-Zalewski.         Miss Stroganova, whose name was originally Rigmor Strom, received her early training in her native Copenhagen, although she never studied at the Royal Danish Ballet School. During the 1930's, when the cosmopolitan Ballets Russes troupes flourished in America and Western Europe, the Russian choreographer Leonide Massine suggested that Miss Strom should adopt Stroganova as a stage name. Inspiration for Masefield         Another major Ballets Russes choreographer, Michel Fokine, coached her in some of his ballets, among them "Les Sylphides," which she danced with several companies. Her performances in that work inspired John Masefield, the poet laureate of England, to write a poem about her called "Sur les Pointes," in which he said:         White, white, you pass, my sweet,         Like dew on grass, my sweet,         Like mankind's dream, my sweet.         In 1937, Miss Stroganova joined the Mordkin Ballet, a New York company that served as the nucleus of Ballet Theater, as American Ballet Theater was originally known. She danced with Ballet Theater from its debut in 1940 until 1942, and again during the 1954-55 season.         She performed the lyrical Waltz solo in an acclaimed production of "Les Sylphides," supervised by Fokine, which was the opening work on the company's opening night. That season, she was also featured in the American premiere of Antony Tudor's tragic "Dark Elegies."         Miss Stroganova was a ballerina for Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, from 1942-47 and again in 1951 and 1952. She made a triumphant return to Copenhagen in 1950 as the first Danish dancer trained outside that company's school to be a guest star with it. Demanding Teacher         Miss Stroganova, an effervescent, birdlike woman, taught at several New York schools; in recent years, she had her own studio in the City Center building. She was known as a demanding and keenly observant teacher. Yet her warmth and enthusiasm made her classes encouraging as well as challenging.         Miss Stroganova's marriage to Vladimir Dokoudovsky, also a ballet teacher, ended in divorce.         In addition to her daughter, of St. Louis, she is survived by her companion, Kenneth MacKenzie.         Memorial services are to be held at 10 A.M. on Wednesday at St. Peter's Church, 54th Street and Lexington Avenue.       
         Nancy Lancaster, an American-born socialite who had been an international influence on interior and garden design since the 1920's, died on Friday at her home near Little Haseley, Oxfordshire, England. She was 96.         She died in her sleep after a brief illness, said her daughter-in-law, Lady Anne Tree.         A native of Virginia who moved to England in 1926, Nancy Lancaster was instrumental in creating what is popularly known as the English-country look. This school of interior decoration is characterized by sun-bleached chintz, vibrant wall colors, a casual mix of furniture from various historical periods and an atmosphere of disheveled coziness. John Fowler, Mrs. Lancaster's partner in the London design firm of Colefax & Fowler, called it "pleasing decay."         According to Robert Becker, whose biography of Mrs. Lancaster is to be published by Alfred A. Knopf next year, it was an esthetic fueled by memories of Southern plantation houses that had fallen into romantic disrepair after the Civil War. Among these was her grandfather's estate, Mirador, near Charlottesville. 'An Abstract Nostalgia'         "It was an abstract nostalgia that was particularly appealing to the British upper classes," Mr. Becker said. "Thanks to two world wars, they were losing their way of life, too, just as the Virginians had."         Born in 1897, Nancy Keene Perkins was a daughter of Lizzie Langhorne and T. Moncure Perkins, a meatpacking executive. Orphaned at the age of 15, she was raised by her aunt, Irene Langhorne Gibson, a celebrated beauty who was the original Gibson Girl, a symbol of American womanhood at the turn of the century. Another Langhorne aunt was Nancy, Viscountess Astor, the first woman elected to the House of Commons.         Though Mrs. Lancaster was co-owner of Colefax & Fowler from 1944 to the mid-1980's, she was not a professional decorator. "I'm agin decoratin'," she once said in a Tidewater drawl that remained undimmed after more than 65 years away from home. "I'm a percolator of ideas." The appearance of her own homes -- notably her London apartment's butter-yellow drawing room, completed in 1958 -- inspired generations of designers in Europe and the United States. Her followers include Sister Parish, Mark Hampton and Mario Buatta.         "She brought American vitality to stuffy British houses, which often looked like museums," Mr. Buatta said. "After Nancy blew into town, England loosened up and started looking more personal and lived-in." Cultivator of Roses         Mrs. Lancaster also revived interest in old-fashioned roses, which she cultivated at Ditchley Park, a 3,000-acre estate in Oxfordshire that was her home from 1933 to 1947. One of her last homes, Haseley Court, was the subject of a 1993 BBC television documentary, "An Englishwoman's Garden." She also advised on the restoration of Stratford Hall, a Virginia home of a relative, Robert E. Lee.         Nancy Lancaster's first husband was Henry Field, a grandson of Marshall Field, the department-store magnate. He died in 1918, six months after their wedding. Two years later, she married another Field grandson, Ronald Lambert Tree, who later became a Conservative member of Parliament. They divorced in 1947. She later wed another British politician, Col. Claud G. Lancaster. That marriage also ended in divorce.         Sought after by leading artists and photographers -- John Singer Sargent, Cecil Beaton, Baron De Meyer and Horst P. Horst all paid homage -- Mrs. Lancaster was a popular hostess for guests from American diplomats to the King and Queen of England.         Between 1940 and 1942, Winston Churchill spent many weekends at Ditchley Park, which was considered safer from Axis bombers than the Prime Minister's official country residence, Chequers.         In addition to her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lancaster is survived by a son, Michael Tree; a sister, Alice Winn; and two granddaughters, all of London.       
         Dr. Marion F. Langer, a former executive director of the American Orthopsychiatric Association and an expert on widowhood, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was cancer, said Karen Kun of the association's staff.         Dr. Langer, who had a Ph.D. in sociology from New York University, was on the boards of the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in Washington, and the National Coalition Against Censorship.         She was the orthopsychiatric association's executive director from 1953 until she retired in 1988. The association, which has its headquarters in Manhattan, was founded in 1924 by Karl Menninger (1893-1990), the psychiatrist, and others to advance a preventive approach to treating mental illness. Orthopsychiatry offers treatment through a collaborative approach involving such fields as psychiatry, psychology, psychiatric social work and other sciences.         Her writings included a book, "Learning to Live as a Widow," published in 1957. In an interview in 1963, she said that widows usually blame their husbands for dying, although that feeling is irrational.         "Unlike the divorcee, who is expected freely to express her resentment toward her former spouse, the widow is not supposed to be angry," Dr. Langer said. As a result, she said, feelings of anger are repressed and affect the widow's social relationships.         Dr. Langer was born and raised in Newburgh, N.Y. and studied at Smith College and elsewhere before receiving her Ph.D. in 1949. She was assistant director of the Child Study Association of America before going to the Orthopsychiatric Association.         Over the years, she taught at City College, New York University, the Hunter College School of Social Work and elsewhere.         She married Julius Rosenberg, a lawyer, in 1940; he died in 1948. Her 1957 marriage, to Samuel Gruber, also a lawyer, ended in divorce in 1973.         Dr. Langer is survived by a son, Seth Rosenberg of Chatham, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows. Here is a sampling.

The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Carmen McRae, the jazz singer known for her probing interpretations of lyrics and her bruised but unbowed point of view, died on Thursday evening at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 74.         She had fallen into a semi-coma four days earlier, a month after being hospitalized for a stroke, said her secretary, Jan March. She withdrew from public performance in May 1991 after an episode of respiratory failure only hours after she completed an engagement at the Blue Note jazz club in New York.         Although Ms. McRae never reached the heights of popularity attained by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday, she was widely regarded as their artistic equal. In a prolific recording career that spanned nearly five decades, she had only two minor hits, both in the mid-1950's. But the scores of songs on she which stamped her bittersweet, gently mocking signature included "Alfie," "The Music That Makes Me Dance," "Guess Who I Saw Today?," "Blame It on My Youth," "Yesterdays" and "Mean to Me." In January, she received a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Fellowship award for lifetime achievement.         Ms. McRae was born in Harlem on April 8, 1920, one of four children of immigrants from the West Indies. Growing up in Brooklyn, she attended Julia Richman High School in Manhattan and received her musical grounding in five years of formal piano lessons.         Like many other jazz giants of her generation, she had her first break when she won an amateur talent contest at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. It was there that she was discovered in 1939 by Irene Kitchings, who was then married to the jazz pianist Teddy Wilson. Through Wilson, who worked with Billie Holiday, Ms. McRae met the woman who became her biggest influence and who recorded Ms. McRae's song "Dream of Life."         "If Billie Holiday had never existed," Ms. McRae later recalled, "I probably wouldn't have, either."         Ms. McRae's parents, who opposed a show-business career, persuaded their daughter to take a secretarial course, and she spent two years in Washington doing clerical work for the Government. Returning to Brooklyn in 1943, she did office work by day while performing in clubs at night. Gradually music took over, and she began substituting for other singers in bands led by Benny Carter, Count Basie and Earl (Fatha) Hines. She eventually landed an 18-month engagement with a band led by Mercer Ellington, Duke's son, and in 1946 she made her recording debut with the band, singing under the name Carmen Clarke.         In Chicago, when the Ellington band broke up, Ms. McRae remained there and embarked on a solo career. A two-week engagement in a club as a singing pianist expanded to 17 weeks, and she ended up staying in Chicago three and a half years.         Her career took off when she returned to New York and developed an act as a stand-up singer at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem, receiving enough notice to be named best new female singer by Down Beatmagazine.         Ms. McRae released her first solo album for Bethlehem in 1955, the same year she made her first recordings for Decca, where she remained until 1958. From there she moved to Kapp (1958-60) and Columbia (1960-62), then jumped to several smaller labels before ending up on Atlantic for five years (1967-71). Her longest record company affiliation was with Concord Jazz (1980-88). Her last two albums, for RCA, were tributes to Thelonious Monk and Sarah Vaughan.         In these four decades as a jazz star, Ms. McRae toured constantly. Although she left New York for Southern California in the late 1960's, she appeared in New York regularly, usually at the Blue Note, where she did two engagements a year through most of the 1980's.         From the moment she made her mark, Ms. McRae was recognized as a supremely insightful interpreter of lyrics.         "Every word is very important to me," she said. "Lyrics come first, then the melody. The lyric of a song I might decide to sing must have something that I can convince you with. It's like an actress who selects a role that contains something she wants to portray."         The singer's two marriages, to the be-bop drummer Kenny Clarke and the pianist Ike Isaacs, both ended in divorce. There was no immediate word on survivors.
