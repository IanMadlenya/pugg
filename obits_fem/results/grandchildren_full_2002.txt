         Peggy Lee, whose sultry singing style set standards for pop jazz sophistication for more than half a century, died on Monday night at her home in Los Angeles. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Nicki Lee Foster. Ms. Lee had surmounted many medical problems to continue performing until the last few years.         She was billed throughout most of her career as Miss Peggy Lee (and, in fact, she insisted on it). In the golden age of big bands she was a singer of renown with Benny Goodman's orchestra and she went on to become a top nightclub singer, a prolific recording artist, a successful songwriter and an actress skillful enough to be nominated for an Oscar.         Duke Ellington called her ''the Queen.'' She was a weaver of moods and colors, her misty voice conveying impeccable rhythmic subtlety and smoldering sexuality. In a world of belters, she was a minimalist who eliminated any hint of the extraneous in both her voice and gestures, and she could stir audiences with an understated phrase more than most singers could by shouting and stomping.         Stephen Holden, a movie and cabaret critic for The New York Times, described her image as ''Billie Holiday meets Mae West.''         Miss Lee made more than 700 recordings and more than 60 albums. Her own favorite album, ''The Man I Love,'' was recorded in 1957 with arrangements by Nelson Riddle and an orchestra conducted by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra was so intimately involved with the album that he obtained some menthol to make Miss Lee's eyes look properly misty for the cover photograph.         She is credited with having a hand in writing more than 200 songs, in most cases as a lyricist. Among the hits she wrote were ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me).'' Her name is indelibly linked with a number of songs, including ''Golden Earrings,'' ''Fever,'' ''Lover,'' ''Big Spender,'' ''You're My Thrill,'' ''I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ''Them There Eyes'' and the haunting Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller tune that became her signature in later years, ''Is That All There Is?''         ''She makes her listeners feel cherished,'' Whitney Balliett wrote of her in The New Yorker. ''Her singing lulls you, and it is easy to forget how daring it is. Many singers confuse shouting with emotion. Peggy Lee sends her feelings down the quiet center of her notes.''         ''She is a subtle and brilliant showman,'' he added. ''She can slink, arch an eyebrow, pull out a hip and rest a hand on it, half smile, wave wandlike arms, bump, tilt her head and slouch -- all to dazzling, precise effect.''         Miss Lee was named Norma Deloris Egstrom at her birth on May 27, 1920, in Jamestown, N.D. She was the sixth of seven children of Marvin and Selma Egstrom. Her father was a railroad station agent who drank too much. His job kept the family moving from town to town in lonely parts of North Dakota. Her mother died when she was 4 and her father remarried. Five-year-old Norma was brutally abused by her stepmother, who would hit her over the head with an iron skillet, beat her with a razor strap and drag her around by her hair. By the age of 7, she was keeping house, baking, cooking, cleaning and milking cows.         There was never any doubt in her mind that she would become a singer. ''I had always sung -- I sang before I could talk,'' she reminisced in her 1989 autobiography, ''Miss Peggy Lee'' (Donald I. Fine). She was 14 when she made her professional debut at a local radio station in Jamestown and was still a teenager when a program director at a radio station in Fargo gave her a job and her stage name. The job paid $1.50 for each noonday show. To make ends meet, she worked a 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift in a bakery, slicing and wrapping bread for 35 cents an hour.         A friend who had gone to California suggested she join her. She sold the watch her father had given her at her high school graduation for $30, bought a train ticket and arrived in Hollywood with $18. She got a brief singing engagement in a supper club but mostly worked as a waitress before returning to North Dakota. She found work singing for a radio station in Fargo, then as a singer in Minneapolis with Will Osborne's band.         Miss Lee was discovered in Chicago in 1941 by Benny Goodman, who was looking for a replacement for his vocalist, Helen Forrest, who was leaving to join Artie Shaw's band. He heard her sing ''These Foolish Things'' at the Ambassador West Hotel and called the next day, offering her the job. She had a cold the first night she appeared, the critics were unkind, and she wanted to quit. Goodman refused to let her go and she stayed on, at $75 a week.         Later that year, the band played the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, and Miss Lee recalled in her autobiography how awed she had been to see Franchot Tone dancing by with Joan Crawford, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne chatting at their table with Katharine Cornell, and Gary Cooper joking with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.         It was Miss Lee's sulky rendition of ''Why Don't You Do Right?'' with the Goodman band in 1942 that made her a star. She sang the Joe McCoy song in a voice that demonstrated she could sing of hard times as well as anybody; her version became one of the the biggest selling records in the country:         You had plenty money nineteen twen'y-two         You let other women make a fool of you         Why don't you do right         Like some other men do?         Get out of here and get me some money, too.         Peggy Lee's tour with the Goodman band lasted less than two years but the collaboration made her one of the most famous female vocalists of the time and put her on the road to fame.         In 1943, Miss Lee left Goodman to marry Dave Barbour, the band's guitarist, with whom she collaborated on a number of hits, including ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana,'' a 1948 blockbuster that sold more than two million records and began her long association with Latin-flavored music.         Her swirling 1952 version of the Richard Rodgers waltz ''Lover'' and her 1958 interpretation of ''Fever'' in six-eight time solidified her reputation as one of the most rhythmically inventive and versatile vocalists in pop.         She made her film debut in 1950, playing a minor role in ''Mr. Music,'' and went on, in 1953, to play a featured role opposite Danny Thomas in a remake of ''The Jazz Singer.'' Her performance as an alcoholic blues singer in ''Pete Kelly's Blues'' (1955) won her an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress.         In 1959 she wrote the lyrics for a Duke Ellington song, ''I'm Gonna Go Fishing,'' for the film ''Anatomy of a Murder.''         She also wrote theme music for the movies ''Johnny Guitar'' and ''About Mrs. Leslie,'' and supplied voices for several characters and sang three songs in the 1952 Walt Disney animated film ''Lady and the Tramp.'' She was paid $3,500 by Disney and no royalties. When Disney marketed a videocassette without her consent, she sued the company. In 1992, after a four-year court battle, she was awarded $2.3 million.         Another lawsuit over royalties neared an end last week in Los Angeles, when a superior court judge gave preliminary approval for a $4.75-million settlement between Universal Music Group and several hundred recording artists whose lead plaintiff was Miss Lee. Universal acquired Miss Lee's contract and many others through a series of record company mergers over the years. The suit asserted that Universal had cheated artists by underreporting sales figures and overcharging for services. The company has admitted no wrongdoing, and language in the settlement bars both sides from commenting.         Peggy Lee was a perfectionist who planned every aspect of her performances right down to her hairdos, her costly gowns, her lighting, her entrances and exits, even the movement of her hands. She always appeared with first-rate musicians, including the drummer Grady Tate. For decades, because of respiratory problems that began with a bout of viral pneumonia in 1958, she kept oxygen in her dressing room, and she used it between sets.         Miss Lee's performances at Basin Street East in Manhattan beginning in 1959 were credited by Newsweek with ''single-handedly reviving the supper club business.'' Count Basie, Tallulah Bankhead, Cary Grant, Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald were some of the notables who crowded in every night. With more than 600 people in a space meant for 450, a club representative recalled later, ''we had to hire only skinny waiters.''         Her appearances at the Ballroom, a club in Chelsea, were also treated as events.         Miss Lee was married five times, but her great love, she acknowledged, was her first husband and collaborator, Mr. Barbour. He was the father of her only child, Nicki Lee Foster, of Sun Valley, Idaho. In addition to Ms. Foster, she is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Miss Lee described Mr. Barbour in her autobiography as a self-destructive alcoholic. They were married in 1943 and she said in a 1982 interview that he asked her for a divorce in 1951, ''because he didn't want his daughter to see him with his problem.'' In 1965, after Mr. Barbour had been sober for many years, they decided to remarry, but a few days later he died.         Her second marriage, in 1955, to Brad Dexter, an actor, lasted less than a year, and her third, in 1956, to Dewey Martin, also an actor, ended in divorce in 1959. A fourth marriage, in 1964, to Jack Del Rio, a bandleader, also lasted less than a year.         Besides chronic respiratory problems, Miss Lee encountered a number of serious illnesses and accidents over the years.         Late in the 1970's, she returned to San Francisco from a European tour so ill she was immediately hospitalized. Doctors informed her she had a bad heart, diabetes and a disorder of the inner ear; she also went blind temporarily. She was told to retire but went to Australia on tour instead.         She had double-bypass heart surgery in 1985. Two years later she fell onstage at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and fractured her pelvis. When she recovered, she fell again in the marble bathroom of her home in Bel Air section of Los Angeles, injuring the vertebrae in her lower spine.         Still she performed.         ''Peg,'' her musical autobiography, had a hard time on Broadway in 1983, and closed after 13 previews and five performances. It was a rare failure.         She usually appeared in slinky satin or form-fitting glittering gowns, drop-dead dangling earrings and large round tinted glasses. Later, a shoulder length white-blond wig covered her champagne-blond hair. Still later, she used a jeweled cane and often performed sitting down like Mabel Mercer. She had more heart problems in the early 1990's, her daughter said, and suffered a stroke in 1998 that left her bedridden. In 1992, Mr. Holden reviewed a Peggy Lee performance in New York for The Times and wrote that ''her will power, musicality and professionalism enable her to project a fair degree of the old magic.''         In 1990, she received the Pied Piper Award of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers,  Ascap's highest accolade, given for lifetime achievement.         During her last decade, she tried to retire several times. She painted (one of her paintings hung on the wall of Les Célébrités, a former restaurant in the Essex House in Manhattan), grew roses, watched nature programs on television, was active in the Science of Mind spiritual group,  and listened to Ray Charles, Sinatra, Debussy and Chopin. But it wasn't enough. So she would reappear periodically in smaller settings, basking in the warmth of her audiences.         Obituary       
         Edith Bouvier Beale, once a successful model and aspiring actress who later lived a gothic life in Grey Gardens, a dilapidated 28-room house in East Hampton, N.Y., with her mother and dozens of cats, raccoons and opossums, was found dead in her small apartment in Bal Harbour, Fla., on Jan. 14. She was 84.         Her nephew, Bouvier Beale, said the Dade County coroner attributed the death to a heart attack or stroke resulting from arteriosclerosis. Her cousin, John H. Davis, said she appeared to have been dead for five days.         The two Beale women, an aunt and a cousin of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis, became famous when their peculiar living situation was shown in the documentary film ''Grey Gardens,'' made by Albert and David Maysles in 1975. The once-elegant grounds were a tangled jungle; 25 rooms were unused, and the fleas were so thick that the filmmakers wore flea collars around their ankles during the filming.         At one point in the film, Ms. Beale's mother, who had the same name (they were publicly known as Big Edie and Little Edie), laughs when a cat relieves itself behind a youthful portrait of her propped against a bedroom wall.         But the loving but embittered relationship between the two women is perhaps the most compelling theme of the film. In it, the daughter has returned to care for her mother, and repeatedly suggests that life has passed her by as a result. The mother's manner is forcefully controlling.         ''You've had enough fun in your life,'' she tells her daughter, who never stops protesting that she wants to move to New York or Paris.         As young Edie empties a box of cat biscuits for the raccoons in the attic, she says, ''I've been a subterranean prisoner here for 20 years.''         The film drew both rave reviews and hard questions about the invasion of privacy inherent in the Maysleses' trademark technique of using a hand-held camera to capture lives uncomfortably close up. It also provoked comparisons to the memory plays of Tennessee Williams.         ''It's very difficult to keep the line between the past and the present, awfully difficult,'' Little Edie laments in the film.         A startling side effect of the movie has been the continuing interest of the fashion world in the costumes she is shown wearing, including a contrived skirt held over her ample thighs by a pin. She said the skirt could double as a cape.         Italian Vogue and Harper's Bazaar have done photographic layouts of fashions inspired by the movie. Calvin Klein was a fan of the film, and Greta Garbo was said to have been.         Edith Bouvier Beale was born in Manhattan on Nov. 7, 1917. She was the eldest of the 10 grandchildren of John Vernou Bouvier Jr., who spent summers at the family estate in East Hampton, Lasata. Another of the grandchildren was Jacqueline Bouvier, the future first lady.         Mr. Davis, another grandchild and author of ''Bouviers: Portrait of an American Family'' (Farrar, Straus, 1969), said Edie was the family beauty, ''surpassing even the dark charm of Jacqueline.''         Her father was Phelan Beale, a Wall Street lawyer, who raised three children at Grey Gardens on Lily Pond Lane. Her two brothers are dead, and she left no immediate survivors.         The parents' marriage ended in divorce, and Mr. Beale's second wife inherited his estate. Edith, the mother, also incurred the wrath of her father, Major Bouvier, by showing up at the wedding of her son dressed like an opera star, just as the ceremony ended. Two days later, her father cut her out of his will.         She eventually received a $65,000 trust fund, and retained the house her husband gave her in 1923.         Ms. Beale lived a gilded life as a youth. In 1936, The New York Times reported on her debut, at which she wore a gown of white net appliquéd in silver and a wreath of gardenias in her hair.         Starting at 17, she began a successful career as a model. She felt that she was on the verge of a big break into films in 1952, when she was 35. She said she had offers from MGM and Paramount, and that her dance career was set to take off. She also said that wealthy men like Howard Hughes and J. Paul Getty had asked her to marry them.         ''She had a very, very fertile imagination,'' Mr. Davis cautioned.         Whether on the verge of success or not, she was called home to Grey Gardens by her mother, who said she was ill and needed her.         Over the years, things deteriorated. On Oct. 22, 1971, inspectors from the Suffolk County Health Department raided the house and discovered that it violated every known building regulation. In the dining room, they found a five-foot mountain of empty cans; in the upstairs bedrooms, they saw human waste.         The story became a national scandal. Health Department officials said they would evict the women unless the house was cleaned. Mrs. Onassis came to the rescue, paying for a cleanup that included 40 gallons of germicide.         Lee Radziwill, sister of Mrs. Onassis, introduced the Maysleses to her relatives as part of a project she had proposed to film the early years of her and her sister's lives. Though that idea was abandoned, the filmmakers returned to the Beales to suggest a film about them.         The elder Edith Beale died in 1977. Her daughter flirted briefly with a singing career and stayed in Grey Gardens for two years before selling it.         Ms. Beale spent more and more of her time in Florida, where she swam every day. She lived off her small savings.         She had not owned a cat in five years.       
         Astrid Lindgren, the Swedish writer whose rollicking, anarchic books about Pippi Longstocking rattled some tradition-bound Swedes when they first appeared almost 60 years ago but came to captivate millions of children around the world, died yesterday at her home in Stockholm. She was 94.         Mrs. Lindgren, who began publishing in the 1940's, became one of the world's most widely translated authors. In addition to being a beloved cultural figure in Sweden, she was also a powerful political force, successfully lobbying on issues like tax reform and improved conditions for farm animals.         Although Mrs. Lindgren produced more than 70 books for young people, she was best known as the author of the classic ''Pippi Longstocking,'' first published in Sweden in 1945 and in the United States five years later. The title character is a 9-year-old carrot-haired enfant terrible who lives cheerfully by herself in the ramshackle Villa Villekulla and befriends her better behaved, better groomed neighbors, Tommy and Annika.         ''She had no mother and no father, and that was of course very nice because there was no one to tell her to go to bed just when she was having the most fun, and no one who could make her take cod liver oil when she much preferred caramel candy,'' the book begins.         ''Pippi'' and its sequels have together sold millions of copies and been translated into more than 50 languages. The sheer subversive quality of the books, whose brazen young heroine does exactly as she pleases, made them unusual for juvenile literature.         ''Bertrand Russell has written that a child dreams about power as grown-ups dream sexual wish dreams,'' Mrs. Lindgren said in a 1985 interview. ''This is a child who has power. That is wonderful, for children to think, 'Oh, if I were like Pippi! I could say to Father, '' 'You don't do that!' ''         ''She has power, but she never misuses that power,'' Ms. Lindgren said, ''which I think is the most splendid thing, and the most difficult.''         Mrs. Lindgren was born Astrid Anna Emilia Ericsson on Nov. 14, 1907, the second of four children of Samuel August and Hanna Jonsson Ericsson, in Vimmerby, in southern Sweden. Her father was a tenant farmer, and Mrs. Lindgren grew up outside Vimmerby at Nas, a 500-year-old farm, in an old red house surrounded by apple orchards.         ''Rocks and trees were as close to us as living beings, and nature protected and nurtured our playing and our dreaming,'' she wrote in a 1973 memoir. ''Whatever our imagination could call forth was enacted in the land around us -- all fairy tales, all adventures we invented or read about or heard about, all of it happened there, and only there. Even our songs and prayers had their places in surrounding nature.''         The pastoral idyll of Mrs. Lindgren's youth came to an end in 1926, when, 19 and unmarried, she became pregnant. She fled to Copenhagen, where she gave birth to a son, Lars, and later settled in Stockholm.         To support herself, she took a secretarial job at the Royal Automobile Club in Stockholm. (Among Mrs. Lindgren's lesser known writing is the 1939 work ''Twenty-Five Automobile Tours in Sweden.'') In 1931 she married a co-worker, Sture Lindgren. Mrs. Lindgren, who was widowed in 1952, is survived by a sister, Stina Hergin; her daughter, Karin Nyman; seven grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.         It was Karin who first conjured up Pippi. In 1941 when she was 7 she was sick in bed with pneumonia. Night after night she nagged her mother to tell her a story.         ''What should I tell?'' the exhausted Mrs. Lindgren asked one evening.         ''Tell about Pippi Langstrump'' -- Pippi Longstocking -- Karin replied, coining the name on the spot.         Her mother gamely complied.         ''I didn't ask her who Pippi Longstocking was,'' Mrs. Lindgren told The New Yorker in 1983. ''I just began the story, and since it was a strange name it turned out to be a strange girl as well.''         Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Efraim's daughter Longstocking was indeed a strange girl. Her fiery hair stuck straight out from either side of her head in two tight braids. She wore one black stocking and one brown, with black shoes twice as long as her feet. Her mother was long dead; her sailor father had been lost at sea, though Pippi was confident he had come ashore on a South Sea island where ''he had become king of all the cannibals.'' She had a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nilsson for company and a trunkful of gold pieces to provide for her wants.         Like many heroes of traditional Scandinavian lore, Pippi was fearless, ageless and endowed with superhuman strength.         But above all, Pippi was rude:  deeply, outrageously, satisfyingly rude. Invited to a fancy coffee party, she devoured an entire cream cake before the assembled guests.         The sequel ''Pippi Goes on Board'' was published in Sweden in 1946, followed by ''Pippi in the South Seas'' in 1948, ''Pippi on the Run'' in 1971 and several other Pippi stories not translated into English.         In the 1970's she stepped into public life to protest Sweden's income tax laws, which sent self-employed artists like Mrs. Lindgren and the director Ingmar Bergman reeling under a staggering tax burden. A lifelong supporter of the ruling Social Democratic Party, Mrs. Lindgren published a caustic newspaper satire before the 1976 election in which she calculated that, because of competing local and federal taxes, her income was taxed at an annual rate of 102 percent. The Social Democrats, in power for more than 40 years, were defeated, and tax cuts followed, events Mrs. Lindgren was sometimes credited with bringing about.         Although Mrs. Lindgren's career made her wealthy, she continued to live modestly in the same Stockholm apartment where ''Pippi Longstocking'' was first written, rising early to write in bed before going off to her editing job. She regarded her status as one of Sweden's best loved celebrities with characteristic quiet humor.         ''Perhaps this is because in Stockholm drunks come up and hug me all the time,'' she said in 1994. ''And I cannot be that impressed with anyone, except for God.''       
         Aniela Mlynarski Rubinstein, the widow of the pianist Arthur Rubinstein and a patron of charities and the arts in New York, died on Monday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 93.         She was a co-founder of the Polonaise Ball and, as its frequent chairwoman, helped make it a successful fund-raiser. Starting in the mid-1950's, the annual gala contributed to relief programs for Polish refugees.         She was a prominent supporter of other Polish charitable organizations and aided the Four Stars recital series in Paris and the Rubinstein piano competition held every three years in Israel.         Nela, as she was known, was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, the daughter of Emil Mlynarski, the founding conductor of the Warsaw Philharmonic and later director of the Warsaw Opera. He was conducting when a 13-year-old prodigy, then Artur Rubinstein, made his Polish debut.         Nela studied dance in Dresden with Mary Wigman, the German expressionist pioneer. One day in Warsaw, her father took her backstage to meet Rubinstein after a concert.         Though he was 22 years her senior, it was love at first sight, according to family lore. But she first wed, and divorced, another renowned pianist, Mieczyslaw Munz.         She and Rubinstein were married in London in 1932; the marriage lasted until his death in 1982. The couple lived in Paris until the outbreak of World War II, after which they joined the artistic émigré community in Hollywood and became United States citizens in 1946.         By the 1950's, the couple kept homes in New York, Paris and Spain. Artistically gifted and conversant in seven languages, Mrs. Rubinstein became one of New York's legendary hostesses, with a formidable kitchen.         Her repertoire -- Polish and continental, with a dash of New World -- inspired the likes of Craig Claiborne, the food writer and critic, who favored her bigos, or hunter's stew, and nalesniki, or pancakes. A selection of her recipes came together in a book, ''Nela's Cookbook,'' published by Knopf in 1983.         Mrs. Rubinstein is survived by two daughters, Eva and Dr. Alina Rubinstein of Manhattan; two sons, Paul, also of Manhattan, and John, of Los Angeles; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret Loeb Kempner, a philanthropist whose special concerns included the well-being of children, families with children and the elderly, died on Dec. 31 at her home in Purchase, N.Y. She was 102.         In 1999, when Mrs. Kempner had her 100th birthday, she was made an honorary director of The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary, a Manhattan hospital with which she had ties for five decades.         Her father was Carl M. Loeb, former president of the American Metal Company and co-founder with his son John Langeloth Loeb of Carl M. Loeb & Company, later to become known as the Wall Street firm of Loeb, Rhoades & Company.         The Loeb family gave the Loeb Boathouse in Central Park to New York City.         Mrs. Kempner and her husband, Alan H., gave money and time to the Kempner Rare Book Library at Columbia University.         Another beneficiary of her philanthropy and fund-raising was the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York. She was chairman of the board of its women's division and became a lifetime trustee of its successor organization, the UJA-Federation of New York.         She assisted Blythedale Children's Hospital in Valhalla, N.Y., for almost seven decades, raising money and serving on its board. She played the same roles at The New York Eye and Ear Infirmary.         Born in St. Louis, she grew up in Manhattan and graduated in 1917 from the the Horace Mann School for Girls, which closed in 1946.         She married Mr. Kempner in 1920. He died in 1985.         Surviving are two sons, Alan Jr. of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Thomas, of Manhattan; 8 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Sheila Sherlock, one of the world's leading authorities on liver disease and a pioneer in the science of hepatology, died on Dec. 30 at her home in London. She was 83.         Her classic reference work, ''Diseases of the Liver and Biliary System'' (Blackwell Science, 1955), now in its 11th edition and used throughout the world, was the first standard textbook on clinical liver disease.         When Dr. Sherlock began her medical career in the early 1940's, very little was known about liver disease, and hepatology was not even a recognized branch of medicine.         Throughout her career, she conducted clinical research that led to improved diagnosis and treatment of liver disease and that helped establish and later enhance the field of hepatology.         ''When she started, it was unimaginably difficult for a woman to advance in medicine,'' said Dr. Eugene Schiff, former president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. ''But she became a renowned doctor and wrote heavily on liver disease. Her books were very popular because, in the beginning, she was the only author on the subject and loaded them with concise and easy to read information.''         In 1959, she became the first woman to be promoted to a professorship of medicine at the Royal Free Hospital in London, where she helped set up and direct a world famous clinical, research and training center on liver disease.         One of the first of its kind, it gained an international reputation, and doctors from all over the world traveled there to study the disorders of the liver, the body's largest organ, Dr. Schiff said.         Dr. Jay H. Lefkowitch of the department of pathology at Columbia University added, ''Most of the liver world spent some time in her liver unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London, or wished they had.''         In World War II, many doctors were puzzled by jaundice, a liver disorder afflicting many Allied troops. Dr. Sherlock helped improve understanding of the condition when she began using liver biopsies -- previously just a research tool -- to diagnose the condition. The method helped shed light on the causes of the disorder and is used today for investigating liver disease.         When word of her work on jaundice reached other medical experts, she began receiving patients from many countries, Dr. James Dooley of the Royal Free Hospital said.         ''She would travel the world to lecture; there was a time in England where every hepatologist had been through her unit,'' said Dr. Dooley, who was Dr. Sherlock's co-author on the last three editions of her book.         In 1966, she helped create what is now a standard test in diagnosing primary biliary cirrhosis, a rare disease that can lead to liver failure. In 1971, she showed that steroid treatment could be effective in treating autoimmune hepatitis.         In the 70's, Dr. Sherlock helped demonstrate the importance of vaccinating against hepatitis B by showing that the disease often leads to cirrhosis, which then puts patients at a high risk of developing liver cancer.         ''She worked on all aspects of liver disease and led the most prominent university and hospital department on hepatology in Europe,'' said Dr. Peter Scheuer, former chairman of histopathology at the University of London. ''She made everything seem simple and clear, which made her a great teacher and an unrivaled lecturer.''         Sheila Sherlock was born on March 31, 1918, in Folkestone, England. Unable to gain acceptance to medical schools in England because of her sex, she went to Scotland to attend the University of Edinburgh. After earning her degree in 1941, she studied at the Postgraduate Medical School of London until 1947, and then at Yale in 1948. In 1959, Dr. Sherlock became chairwoman of the Royal Free Hospital's department of medicine.         Throughout her career Dr. Sherlock published more than 600 papers on the liver. In 1986, she received the Distinguished Service Award of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases, which is awarded only on a special basis. She became a dame in 1978 and last summer, she became a fellow of the Royal Society.         She is survived by her husband of 50 years, Dr. Geraint James of London; two daughters, Auriole Sherlock Davis of Canterbury and Amanda Sherlock James of London; and two grandchildren.       
         Annalee Whitmore Fadiman, a screenwriter, World War II correspondent and the author, with Theodore H. White, of the best seller ''Thunder Out of China,'' died yesterday in Captiva, Fla. She was 85.         Mrs. Fadiman, who as a member of the Hemlock Society supported a right to suicide, took her own life, said her daughter, Anne. Mrs. Fadiman had been suffering from breast cancer and Parkinson's disease.         A woman successful in several careers, Mrs. Fadiman spent much of her life defying the conventions of professions dominated by men. Nancy Sorel, in her book ''The Women Who Wrote the War,'' called Mrs. Fadiman's career ''a real-life movie.'' Sidney Skolsky, the 1940's Hollywood columnist, called her ''the girl reporter of this war.''         Annalee Whitmore was born on May 27, 1916, on the kitchen table of her family's home in Price, Utah, the eldest of four children born to Leland Whitmore, a bank president who built and flew airplanes as a hobby, and Anne Sharp Whitmore, who later became a librarian at the main branch of the New York Public Library.         When Mr. Whitmore lost his job during the Depression, the family  moved to California and struggled to make ends meet. Ms. Whitmore attended Piedmont High School and was admitted to Stanford University in 1933 after scoring highest in the state on a college entrance exam.  She graduated in 1937, having served as the first woman to be managing editor of the Stanford Daily newspaper.         She took a $75-a-month secretarial job at the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in San Francisco, but quit after a year when her boss asked her to type part of the manuscript of a memoir he had written.         In 1938, she moved to Los Angeles and joined the secretarial pool at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. When she heard that MGM needed a film to occupy Judy Garland between ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms,'' she wrote a treatment in a single weekend and became the co-writer of ''Andy Hardy Meets Debutante''(1940), with Garland and Mickey Rooney.         With several more screenplay credits, she was offered a seven-year contract by MGM, but she dreamed of reporting in China, where war was already raging. The War Department allowed no female correspondents in China at that time, so in 1941 she landed a job as the Far East representative of a relief agency. Once in Chungking, writing speeches for Madame Chiang Kai-shek, she won a reporting job with Liberty magazine.         She married Melville Jacoby, a Time magazine correspondent she had first met when they were both Stanford undergraduates. Keeping barely a step ahead of the advancing Japanese forces after Pearl Harbor, they eventually withdrew to Brisbane, Australia. Mr. Jacoby was killed at 25 in an airfield accident near Darwin.         In 1944, Theodore H. White, the Time correspondent (he had been a close friend of Mr. Jacoby), finally persuaded his boss, Henry Luce, to seek War Department accreditation for Ms. Whitmore, so that she could join Mr. White in Chungking. She collaborated with him on ''Thunder Out of China,'' about China's role in the war, the strengths and weaknesses of the Kuomintang and the Communists, and the country's future. The book is still in print.         After the war, Ms. Whitmore wrote articles, lectured widely and appeared on the radio quiz show ''Information Please,'' where she met her second husband, Clifton Fadiman, the program's M.C. and the book reviewer for The New Yorker.         They were married in 1950, and had two children. She is survived by her daughter, of Massachusetts; a son, Kim, of Wyoming; a sister, Carol Whitmore of California; and two grandchildren. Mr. Fadiman died in 1999.       
         Princess Margaret, the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II, whose troubled private life aroused both worldwide sympathy and widespread reprobation, died yesterday morning in London. She was 71.         She suffered a stroke on Friday afternoon, the latest in a series that had left her partly paralyzed in recent months, and developed heart problems overnight, Buckingham Palace said.         The queen announced the death ''with great sadness,'' according to a statement from the palace.         Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is touring West Africa, said he was ''deeply saddened.''         Attractive and fun-loving, Princess Margaret earned a reputation in her youth as a free spirit. But her 20's were clouded by an unlucky romance with Group Capt. Peter Townsend of the Royal Air Force, a Battle of Britain hero with whom she fell in love when he served as an equerry to her father, King George VI.         A Daunting Hurdle: Divorce         In many ways, the group captain  might have made an ideal husband. But the fact that he was divorced raised strong objections from the very establishment the royal family represented. As queen, Margaret's sister, Elizabeth, was the supreme governor of the Church of England, which forbade divorce. Moreover, in the early 1950's, the political storm surrounding Edward VIII's abdication in December 1936 to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis Warfield Simpson, was a not-so-distant memory.         News media scrutiny was relentless and the pressure intense on Princess Margaret, then third in line to the throne, to break off the relationship. Bowing to the demands of a moral code that a decade later would seem quaint to many people, she chose not to marry him.         In May 1960 she married Anthony Armstrong-Jones, a photographer who was himself the child of divorced parents. Their tempestuous marriage produced two children, but ended in divorce in 1978. The princess did not remarry, but her friendships with men, from prominent people like the actor Peter Sellers to less exalted ones like Roderic Llewellyn, an upper-class drifter 17 years her junior whose main accomplishment appeared to be a talent for gardening, hurt her reputation.         So did the fact that she was often less than gracious when faced with the drudgery of public appearances -- the ribbon-cuttings, diplomatic functions and endless other official occasions by which Britain's royals justify their position and the public money that finances it. Easily bored and often petulant, the princess was known for indulging her moods, which could swing, as Charles Hussey, a British journalist wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1965, from ''a gaiety that was sometimes febrile'' to ''Hanoverian gloom.''         Her extravagant style also prompted outrage. Her wedding cost the British government £25,000 -- then the equivalent of $65,000 -- and her six-week honeymoon on the royal yacht Britannia cost £40,000, or about $115,000. In later years she was criticized for demanding motorcycle escorts and government helicopters to travel around Britain.         Yet admirers spoke warmly of her personal generosity, loyalty to the queen and to her friends, and her irreverent sense of of fun. Louis Armstrong, whose music she loved, once referred to her as ''one hip chick,'' and John Lennon playfully nicknamed her ''Priceless Margarine.''         To many people, Princess Margaret was the black sheep of her generation of royals. But that reputation did not necessarily trouble her. According to a biographer, Theo Aronson, she once told the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, ''Disobedience is my joy.''         Princess Margaret Rose was born on Aug. 21, 1930, at Glamis, Scotland, the second daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York, six years before her father became King George VI with the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII.         The Family Braved the Blitz         She was educated at home with her sister, the future Queen Elizabeth II.  During World War II, when the king and queen tried to present an image of both stoicism and good cheer to a battered nation, they rejected the suggestion that their two daughters be sent to Canada to be safe from the danger of the blitz. Instead, the two girls remained with their parents, very much in the public eye.         But with Elizabeth clearly being groomed as the next queen, Princess Margaret was often relegated to the background. According to some courtiers, her parents tried to make up for it by indulging her. ''When my sister and I were growing up, she was made out to be the goody-goody one,'' Princess Margaret told Andrew Duncan, author of ''The Reality of Monarchy'' (1970). ''That was boring so the press tried to make out that I was wicked as hell.''         But in threadbare postwar Britain, the press often portrayed her as a glamorous, high-spirited young woman who delighted in trips to Paris and dancing through the night in fashionable London clubs.         After Elizabeth married Prince Philip of Greece in November 1947, Princess Margaret became one of the most eligible single women in the world, and her name was coupled with various fashionable young men.         She first met Group Captain Townsend during the war, when he joined King George's entourage. The group captain's heroism -- he shot down 11 German planes -- was coupled with a low-key style that appealed to the king. Indeed, King George was godfather to one of his two sons by his wife, Rosemary Pawle, whom he married in 1941 and divorced in 1952 on the ground of adultery.         His relationship with the princess grew closer after the king's death in February 1952, but it did not become public until the coronation of Elizabeth II on June 2, 1953, when Margaret, in a gesture of affection that was captured by news photographers, brushed some lint from his uniform.         Princess Margaret was then 22 and Group Captain Townsend 38. He later wrote that their love ''took no heed of wealth and rank and all the other worldly, conventional barriers which separated us.''         But under the Royal Marriages Act, passed in the reign of George III, Princess Margaret could not marry without the sovereign's permission. Under intense media scrutiny, the affair became as politicized as the one involving King Edward and Mrs. Simpson 16 years before. Both Winston Churchill and the queen's private secretary, Sir Alan Lascelles, advised against allowing the marriage. Pressing Group Captain Townsend to end the romance, the British government posted him to the British Embassy in Brussels as air attaché in June 1953. Princess Margaret learned of his posting while she was on a tour of Rhodesia.  After her return, the lovers kept in touch by telephone and managed to see each other secretly.         But the government continued to oppose a marriage, and though Princess Margaret turned 25 in 1955 and was thus free to marry without the queen's consent, it was made plain to her that if she chose to marry Group Captain Townsend she would lose her royal rights and income. In October of that year, the couple met in Britain, discussed their situation, and came to a decision.         ''I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend,'' Princess Margaret announced in a statement. ''Mindful of the church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.''         Sympathetic observers later said that if the couple had been permitted to marry, the princess would have settled down to a more conventional life, like her sister. But in his 1978 autobiography, ''Time and Chance,''  Group Captain Townsend wrote, ''I simply hadn't the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost.''         In 1959 the group captain married Marie Luce Jamagne, a 20-year-old Belgian. The next year, on May 6, 1960, Princess Margaret married Mr. Armstrong-Jones, also a commoner, who was given the title Earl of Snowdon.         A photographer who made a successful career out of photographing the rich and famous, Mr. Armstrong-Jones also enjoyed the the Bohemian side of London life. He and the princess helped liven the staid image of the royal family with a touch of the Swinging Sixties.         Garland Was Not Amused         But Princess Margaret's love of fun and informality coexisted with a  sterner side. She insisted that she be addressed as ''Ma'am,'' except for her closest friends, who were permitted to call her ''Ma'am darling.'' As a houseguest she was notoriously demanding. At parties she often objected if other guests ignored royal protocol and left before her. Even her children were expected to refer to her as ''Princess Margaret'' in front of visitors. So did her husband,  though he was said to have called her Ducky in private.         The haughty manner alienated many friends. Mr. Aronson relates in ''Princess Margaret'' (1977) how at a party in Beverly Hills she once told Judy Garland through an intermediary that she would like to hear her sing. Angered by the form of the request, Miss Garland replied, ''Tell her I'll sing if she christens a ship first.''         Although the princess and her husband appeared to have a happy family life, by the late 1960's there were nasty public quarrels. This, coupled with an often ill-concealed irritability at official functions and a love of reveling, brought growing public ridicule.         Increasingly resentful of life in the public eye, Lord Snowdon began to spend more time away from the princess, working abroad on photographic projects, sometimes in the company of attractive young women. Princess Margaret also went her own way. She was linked romantically with Anthony Barton, a friend of her husband, and then had a relationship with Robin Douglas-Home, an aristocrat and former army officer who was the nephew of a former prime minister and played the piano in nightclubs.         In February 1967, when the British press began reporting that the royal couple were about to break up, Lord Snowdon, who was working overseas, and Princess Margaret arranged to meet in New York and fly on to the Bahamas, trying to give the impression that nothing was amiss. Shortly afterward, Princess Margaret wrote to Mr. Douglas-Home breaking off the affair. Eighteen months later he committed suicide.         Although the royal couple had made a show of togetherness and were often photographed with their children -- David Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones (Viscount Linley) and Sarah Frances Elizabeth Armstrong-Jones (Lady Sarah Chatto) -- their relations continued to deteriorate.         At Home on a Caribbean Isle         Princess Margaret was often seen in the company of famous men, including Mr. Sellers. She also began to spend more time on the Caribbean island of Mustique, where a friend, Colin Tenant, had given her land as a wedding present and where she built a vacation home known as Les Jolies-Eaux.         In September 1973, at a luncheon in Edinburgh, she met the 25-year-old  Roderic Llewellyn, who soon became a favorite companion. The son of minor nobility, Mr. Llewellyn had worked briefly at a mine in southern Africa and as an apprentice brewer in England. Five months after meeting Princess Margaret he spent three weeks as her guest in Mustique. Although their relationship was soon an open secret in royal circles. the queen, according to Mr. Aronson, was said to have disapproved of Mr. Llewellyn and what she called ''my sister's guttersnipe life.'' But the liaison remained unknown to the public.         Then in February 1976 a news photographer's picture of the couple together on the island caused a scandal. In March the royal family announced that Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret were separating.         Meanwhile, the relationship between the princess and Mr. Llewellyn set off a storm in Parliament. When Mr. Llewellyn was hospitalized with stomach problems during a trip to the Caribbean in March 1978, reports that the princess went to his bedside prompted critics to demand that her royal allowance -- then more than $100,000 a year -- be cut. The battle was played out in the newspapers, with some calling for her to end her relationship with Mr. Llewellyn and take her work more seriously, and others writing in her defense.         Although she was patron of more than 80 charities and organizations, colonel in chief of the Highland Fusiliers of Canada and president of the Royal Ballet, there was increasing resentment of her approach to her duties. Critics complained that the number of her public appearances, which had once averaged 150 a year, had dwindled to well below 100. Some Labor members of Parliament called her an embarrassment to the monarchy.         Then in May, while she was hospitalized with hepatitis, Kensington Palace, where she lived, issued a statement announcing her divorce, an action that ended a 400-year-old taboo on divorce in the royal family.         In the fall, Princess Margaret, on an official visit to Tuvalu in the South Pacific, became ill and had to be flown to Sydney, Australia, for treatment. That December, a month after her return to Britain, Lord Snowdon married Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, who had been married to a film director.         Princess Margaret's traumatic private life had long taken a toll on her health. She smoked heavily and her enthusiasm for Scotch sometimes shocked her companions. In 1974, according to Mr. Aronson, she suffered a nervous breakdown.         The princess herself remained reticent about her private life. ''I have no intention of telling people what I have for breakfast,'' she once said.         Sometimes, however, she had a penchant for saying the wrong thing. In October 1979, six weeks after Earl Mountbatten was killed by Irish Republican Army terrorists, she angered many Irish-Americans while on a visit to Chicago, reportedly declaring in the presence of Mayor Jane Byrne that the Irish were ''pigs.''         But she could also be quite gracious. In 1980, when Mr. Llewellyn told her that he was breaking off their relationship to marry Tatiania Soskin, a fashion designer, she assured the younger couple she would be happy to attend their wedding, and she remained friends with both.         Lunch With an Old Lover         As the 1980's progressed, public interest turned to the romantic travails of the next generation of royals. Two of the queen's three sons -- Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Andrew, the Duke of York -- married and divorced under the glare of relentless publicity. Anne, the princess royal and the queen's only daughter, was permitted to divorce her husband, Capt. Mark Philips, and in 1992 married a royal equerry.         Through the years the princess  had corresponded with Peter Townsend and in 1992, while he was on a rare visit to Britain, she invited him to lunch at Kensington Palace attended by several other people. The 77-year-old group captain and the 61-year-old princess sat and ''chatted like the old friends they were.'' Group Captain Townsend died in Paris in 1995.         It was often speculated how different her life might have been had the two been allowed to marry.         ''In my opinion, this was the turning point to disaster for the royal family,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, at the time of Group Captain  Townsend's death. ''After Princess Margaret was denied marriage, it backfired and more or less ruined Margaret's life. The queen decided that from then on, anyone someone in her family wanted to marry would be more or less acceptable. The royal family and the public now feel that they've gone too far in the other direction.''         Princess Margaret is survived by her son, Lord Linley, her daughter, Lady Sarah, and three grandchildren.         As she grew older, the princess  lived less in the public eye. ''They leave me alone these days,'' Mr. Aronson quoted her as saying. ''Today they have other fish to fry.''         Correction:  February 15, 2002, Friday  Because of an editing error, a television review on Feb. 4 about ''Bertie and Elizabeth,'' a ''Masterpiece Theater'' presentation on the life of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, misstated the policy of the Church of England on divorce, a factor in the abdication of her brother-in-law King Edward VIII, who became the Duke of Windsor. An obituary of her daughter Princess Margaret on Sunday also included the error. The church does not forbid divorce. It revokes the right to marry in a parish church while a former spouse is living. But even then, depending on circumstances, a priest can allow a church wedding.       
         Elisabeth Mann Borgese, a multifaceted writer, defender of marine resources and founder of the International Oceans Institute based in Malta, died on Feb. 8 while on vacation in St. Moritz, Switzerland. She was 83 and lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia.         Professor Borgese was the last surviving child of Thomas Mann. She was a pianist by training, a multilingual political scientist and a writer of fiction and of oceanic yearbooks.         She helped organize the international Peace in the Oceans Conference of 1970, the first of 30 such meetings worldwide. She was an enduring presence at those gatherings, which brought about the United Nations Law of the Seas treaty in 1982.         Elisabeth Mann was born in Munich, the second youngest of three girls and three boys of Thomas and Katia Pringsheim Mann. (W. H. Auden became her brother-in-law when the poet married her sister Erika to provide her with a British passport.)         Hoping to become a musician, Elisabeth studied the piano and cello, receiving a diploma from the Conservatory of Music in Zurich in 1938.         The Mann family had left Germany after Hitler came to power, moving first to Switzerland and, in 1938, to the United States. In 1939, Elisabeth married Giuseppe A. Borgese, a professor 36 years her senior who had fled Fascist Italy; he died in 1952.         She became a United States citizen in 1941 but took Canadian citizenship in 1983. She worked as an editor and researcher in Chicago, including two years as executive secretary of the board of the Encyclopedia Britannica in the mid-1960's.         She served as a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, Calif., before joining the faculty at Dalhousie University in Halifax in 1979, first as a political science professor and later as an adjunct law professor.         In the 1970's, Professor Borgese formed the International Oceans Institute, which has since grown to 20 centers.         She is survived by two daughters, Angelica Borgese of Manhattan and Turkey, and Dr. Domenica Borgese of Milan; a son, Marcel Deschamps of Halifax; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Stuart, a veteran actress and pioneer of soap operas who spent 35 years as the star of one daytime series built around her, died on Thursday at her home in New York. She was 76.         She died after a stroke, but had been ill with gastric cancer and bone cancer, her family said.         Legions of fans lived with and felt they knew her two most famous characters, Joanne Gardner Barron Tate Vincente Tourneur on ''Search for Tomorrow,'' and Meta Bauer on ''The Guiding Light.''         Ms. Stuart, whose original name was Mary Houchins, was born in Miami and grew up in Tulsa, Okla. She started performing in early childhood. When she was 9, Count Basie's orchestra came through town, and held a contest to find a young female singer to perform with them. They chose Ms. Stuart, and she sang ''Little Girl Blue'' at two of their shows, said her husband, Wolfgang Neumann, an architect. The shows were late, so the band provided a cot backstage so she could sleep between sets.         The story of her rise to stardom resembles a Hollywood fantasy. At 17 she hitchhiked to New York, working at various jobs to support herself. For a little while she was a booking agent for an airline. ''Her sense of geography was absolutely abysmal,'' Mr. Neumann said. ''She didn't last long there.''         She became a hat-check and cigarette girl at the Roosevelt Hotel, where she met the film producer Joe Pasternak, who offered her a screen test. Her nerves got the better of her at the audition, her husband said, and Mr. Pasternak reportedly told her: ''You can't sing, you can't walk, but there is something that you have. Let's find out what it is.''         She spent the next few years working in movies in Hollywood, mostly in small parts, but sometimes with an icon of 1940's cinema. She appeared in more than 20 films, including ''The Girl From Jones Beach'' with Ronald Reagan, ''The Adventures of Don Juan'' with Errol Flynn and ''This Time for Keeps'' with Esther Williams.         After a few years, she returned to New York. ''She realized she wasn't cut out for Hollywood,'' her husband said. ''It was too ruthless.''         In 1951, she won the role of Jo in a new CBS soap opera, ''Search for Tomorrow,'' and played the long-suffering Joanne until 1986, when the show, which had moved to NBC, went off the air.         When not acting, Ms. Stuart read to children in the public schools of New York as part of a program called Book PALS (Performing Artists for Literacy in Schools), a program of the Screen Actors Guild Foundation to encourage children to read for pleasure. She started the New York chapter of the program in 1992. She also started a a Reading Club in 1996 for 4th and 5th graders in six schools. Today, more than 3,300 children in 10 schools are members. Nationally, the program is in 18 cities.         Her character on ''Search for Tomorrow'' endured many hardships and husbands, but remained noble and dignified throughout them, and broke new ground along the way. She was the first daytime actress to have her pregnancy written into the plot. The producers even filmed Ms. Stuart at the hospital after she gave birth to her son in 1956.         ''They filmed her in her hospital bed, to satisfy the fans and let them share in her happiness,'' said Mary Alice Dwyer-Dobbin, executive in charge of Procter & Gamble Productions.         Her son's career on the show was short-lived, however. Within a few days his character was killed off in an accident, much to the horror of his mother and the viewers. ''She really played the death of her son,'' said her daughter, Cynthia, ''and it was too painful for viewers to watch.''         Ms. Stuart was married twice before. In addition to her husband, daughter and son, Jeffrey Krolik of California, she is survived by two grandchildren.         For some of her fans her character was real. ''It was just like famìly,'' said Theresa Cristalli, who watched ''Search for Tomorrow''  from the very beginning. ''You keep watching day after day. I got hooked on them.''         Ms. Stuart was as loyal to her fans as they were to her. She responded to as much of her fan mail as she could, her daughter said. She even befriended some; she invited Ms. Cristalli and a friend to view the last taping of the show in 1986, and they kept in touch through cards and letters over the years.         Correction:  March 6, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary of the soap opera star Mary Stuart on Sunday misstated her age. She was 75, not 76.       
         Theresa Castro, who with her husband, Bernard, made Castro virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in New York and Florida, died on Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 85.         Her daughter, Bernadette Castro, the New York State parks commissioner, said she died at North Shore University Hospital. She lived in Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Castro used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the Castro Convertible Corporation. At first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. When Bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage.         As the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in New York and Florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations.         Success was measured by the innumerable Castro convertibles in apartments and houses. It was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in Lloyd Harbor, on Long Island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in Ocala, Fla.; a house in Fort Lauderdale; an apartment in Manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht.         But Mrs. Castro retained a homey style. After founding a country club in Marion County, Florida, she started a golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. Her lasagna was legendary.         Her biggest success was surely her idea of using Bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas. The commercial -- shown 40,000 times in various forms -- was one of the first local advertisements to run on New York television and was said to be the first to feature a child.         Mrs. Castro was born Theresa Barabas on a dairy farm outside McKeesport, Pa., on Feb. 15, 1917. Her father was Hungarian and her mother Austrian. At the age of 13, Theresa entered a convent to fulfill a promise her mother had made to an order of nuns. She eventually left, promising her mother that she would ''do more good from outside the cloistered walls.''         As a child, the second of 14 children, she lived in poverty, sharing a bedroom with six siblings; she never spoke of ''the good old days,'' her daughter said. When she moved to New York at 17, she saw her first movie and met Mr. Castro, her ''dream man.'' They were married on Valentine's Day 1942.         Mr. Castro died in 1991. Their son, Bernard Jr., died after he was shot in his home in Fort Lauderdale in 1974. In addition to Bernadette, who lives in Lloyd Harbor, Mrs. Castro is survived by three brothers, Andrew Barabas, of Danbury, Conn., John Barabas, of Ocala, and Steve Barabas, of northern Florida. She is also survived by four sisters, Betty Bassett of Danbury, Barbara Castro of northern Florida, Julie Miller of Danbury and Mary Vitale of Connecticut and Florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         Her many charitable interests included the Golden Hills Academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. She helped found an interfaith chapel at the Florida School for the Deaf in St. Augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986.         Her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to Krause's Furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. One idea was the Ready Lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. Another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. It was called the Scotch and Sofa.         Correction:  March 15, 2002, Friday  An obituary on March 6 about Theresa Castro, who with her husband established the company that makes Castro Convertible sofas, omitted some survivors. Mrs. Castro had six grandchildren, not four, and seven great-grandchildren, not five.       
         Shirley Scott, a jazz organist who recorded dozens of albums from the 1950's to the 90's, earning her the nickname ''Queen of the Organ,'' died on Sunday at a hospital in Philadelphia. She was 67 and lived in West Chester, Pa.         The cause was heart disease brought on by the diet drug known as fen-phen, said Everett Yancey, her son.         Ms. Scott had sued both American Home Products, now known as Wyeth, the manufacturer of one of the drug's components, and the doctor who prescribed it to her. In February 2000 a Philadelphia jury awarded her $8 million.         She had begun using fen-phen in 1995 and within two years developed extensive heart and lung problems, Mr. Yancey said..         Ms. Scott emerged in the mid-1950's, the golden age of Hammond B3 organ jazz, with a quick, punchy sound that merged bebop, gospel and the blues. She had a lighter touch than Jimmy Smith, the leading organist in jazz, and relied on the blues less heavily than he did. In her groups with the saxophonists Eddie  Davis, known as Lockjaw, and Stanley Turrentine, to whom she was married for a number of years, Ms. Scott produced some of the most influential recordings in the smoother, more pop-oriented soul-jazz style.         Her recorded output was great, with more than 50 albums as a leader to her credit, most on the Prestige and Impulse labels. Her first recordings were with Davis, and she played with him on a number of classics, including his ''Cookbook'' albums and the 1958 hit song ''In the Kitchen.''         In 1960 she married Turrentine and made a number of albums with him over the next decade, including ''Soul Shoutin','' ''Blue Flames'' and ''Hip Soul.'' Their music together was often intense, but Ms. Scott also recorded plenty of easygoing tracks, often including show tunes and pop covers like the Beatles' ''Can't Buy Me Love.''         A lifelong Philadelphian, Ms. Scott continued to play clubs in the city into the 90's, though she eventually switched to piano.         In the 90's she also began teaching jazz history and piano at Cheyney University in Cheyney, Pa., and worked as the musical director for Bill Cosby's short-lived television quiz show, ''You Bet Your Life.''         In addition to Mr. Yancey, of Philadelphia, she is survived by her son Thomas, also of Philadelphia; three daughters, Lisa Turrentine, of West Chester, Pa., and Pamela and Nicole Turrentine, of Philadelphia; nine grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Rosetta LeNoire, a theatrical producer and a pioneer of nontraditional casting who also played the sweet, all-knowing Mother Winslow on the television show ''Family Matters,'' died on Sunday in Teaneck, N.J. She was 90.         She lived at the Actors' Fund Nursing and Retirement Home in Englewood, N.J., after spending most of her life in the Bronx, said Donna Trinkoff, producing director of the Amas Musical Theater. Miss LeNoire founded Amas, a nonprofit theater group, in 1968, partly to promote interracial casting. The company produced hits including ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.''         Miss LeNoire's life coincided with glittering moments in show business. Her godfather was Bill Robinson, the tap dancer known as Bojangles, and her music teacher was the jazz pianist and composer Eubie Blake. She was directed by Orson Welles in his all-black version of ''Macbeth'' in the 1930's.         She acted in some of the earliest television shows, and once joked that she seemed to play every maid's role on Broadway.         Perhaps as a result, she was an early and effective advocate of expanding opportunities for minority performers to act in plays and musicals. In 1989, her friend Colleen Dewhurst, who was then president of Actors' Equity, chose Miss LeNoire as the first recipient of what became the union's annual award for broadening participation in theater. The award was named for her.         ''Rosetta created nontraditional casting before the phrase itself was created,'' The New York Beacon, a newspaper with a largely black readership, said in 1997.         In 1999, President Clinton lauded her long fight against discrimination as he presented her with the National Medal of the Arts, one of her many honors.         ''Rosetta did more than dream of a theater with no color bar -- she actually built one,'' he said.         Miss LeNoire, whose name was originally Rosetta Burton, was born in 1911 in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan. Her paternal grandfather played the organ for five churches in the West Indies, and her father was one of the first black plumbers and electricians licensed by New York State.         When she was a child, her mother died of pneumonia at the age of 27 after giving birth to her brother in a Harlem hospital corridor because segregated policies barred her from a room. Rosetta was crippled with rickets, a result of vitamin deprivation, and when she was 7 doctors broke her legs so the bones could grow properly.         Mr. Robinson, a member of the Elks Club with her father, volunteered to become godfather of the girl he called Brown Sugar. At 13, when her leg braces came off, she began music lessons with Mr. Blake, who told her to ''look up and be proud of yourself.'' When she was 15, she became a chorus girl with the Time Steppers, Mr. Robinson's troupe.         A marriage to an elevator operator ended in divorce. She then married Egbert Brown, who owned a fleet of cabs; he died after 26 years of marriage.         She is survived by her son, William, of Manahawkin, N.J.; her sister, Mary A. Francis of Palm Coast, Fla.; her brothers, Wilmote Burton of the Bronx, and Warren Burton of Palm Coast; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Study at a government-sponsored Works Progress Administration program at a theater on the Lower East Side led to a role in the all-black version of ''Macbeth,'' which Orson Welles was producing in Harlem. She toured with the production.         ''Good lord! He was a delegate from heaven,'' she said of Mr. Welles. ''He was the only one who had faith that blacks could bring the right dignity and sophistication to Shakespeare.''         Later she joined the Robert Earl Jones Theater Group. In addition to acting, she cared for Mr. Jones's infant son, James Earl Jones.         She made her Broadway debut in 1939 in ''The Hot Mikado,'' an all-black version of the operetta.         ''It was something,'' she said. ''There were 125 of us, all black Japanese.''         Her other theater credits include ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''The Sunshine Boys,'' ''Lost in the Stars,'' ''Cabin in the Sky'' and ''Sophie.'' She played the role of Stella in ''Anna Lucasta'' in 1944, toured with the show and starred in the 1958 film version, with Sammy Davis Jr. and Eartha Kitt. Her other movie credits include ''Moscow on the Hudson,'' Playing for Keeps'' and ''Brewster's Millions.''         She worked in television during its experimental days, and later appeared in ''Search for Tomorrow,'' ''The Guiding Light,'' ''Amen'' and ''A World Apart. She played Nell Carter's mother, Mama, on NBC's ''Gimme a Break'' and was Mother Winslow on ABC's ''Family Matters'' for eight years.         Eight years after founding Amas, she added a children's theatrical course to its program. (Amas is a form of the verb ''to love'' in Latin.) The company's hits included ''Bojangles'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar,'' a Tony nominee in 1976.         ''I produce musicals,'' she said. ''Music is one avenue where no one seems to have any discriminatory attitudes.''       
         Dorothy DeLay, one of the world's most famous teachers of the violin and a mentor to two generations of players ranging from Itzhak Perlman to Midori and Sarah Chang, died on Sunday. She was 84 and lived in Upper Nyack, N.Y.         Miss DeLay, as her students continued to call her even after they became star performers, began her teaching career almost as an afterthought in 1947, when she was a student of Ivan Galamian at the Juilliard School. Accepting a handful of invitations for part-time teaching and assistantships at the Henry Street Settlement, the Juilliard School and Sarah Lawrence College led her to realize that she enjoyed teaching more than she enjoyed performing.         For more than 20 years she worked largely in Galamian's shadow, but in the 1970's she became a sought-after teacher in her own right, and became the first woman -- and the first American-born violnist -- to be regarded as a master violin teacher in the tradition of Galamian and Leopold Auer.         The list of students who became famous soon after leaving her studio quickly blossomed starting in the 1970's. In addition to Mr. Perlman, Midori and Ms. Chang, they include Nadja Salerno-Sonnenberg, Nigel Kennedy, Gil Shaham, Shlomo Mintz and Cho-Liang Lin. Also among her pupils are members and often founders of some of the world's great chamber groups, among them the Juilliard, the Tokyo, the Cleveland, the Vermeer, the Takacs and the Ying Quartets. Others like Joseph Swenson and Peter Oundjian became conductors and many became concertmasters and section players in orchestras around the world as well as members of conservatory faculties. At the Juilliard School, the faculty includes 14 of her former students.         Miss DeLay was as well known for her easygoing, direct manner and her homey advice as she was for the demanding five-hour practice regimen she recommended in which full hours were devoted to technical basics, etudes, repertory pieces, concertos and works by Bach but also in which 10-minute breaks between hours were allowed. Instead of imposing her views about the great violin repertory on her pupils, she encouraged them to discuss their own interpretive ideas. If they appeared to be on the wrong path, she would gently steer them right. Some of her former students described her work in Zen-like terms.         ''I think the greatest things about Dorothy DeLay,'' Ms. Salerno-Sonnenberg said in a 1992 interview, ''is that she has the ability to look at a young student or an old student and pretty much size up their character and the way that they think -- their personality, basically -- and how in a short period of time what's the best door to use to get them into here. And that's her method -- that fact that there is really no method.''         Yet Miss DeLay's easygoing manner was not to be taken entirely at face value. Having molded dozens of top-flight soloists, she also became an important power broker in the music business. Conductors and managers trusted her advice.         Dorothy DeLay was born on March 31, 1917, in Medicine Lodge, Kan. Her parents were both musicians and teachers. She later described the household as strict and religious and said that her mother briefly toured the country with Carry Nation, campaigning against alcohol. Miss DeLay began playing the violin when she was 4 and gave a recital at her church when she was 5. When she was 16, she enrolled at the Oberlin Conservatory in Ohio, where she studied the violin with Raymond Cerf, a student of the Belgian virtuoso and composer Eugène Ysaye.         After a year Miss DeLay transferred to Michigan State University, after her parents decided that they did not want her to study solely music. But the violin remained her focus, and after her graduation in 1937, when she was 20, she moved to New York and enrolled at the Juilliard School to continue her studies with Louis Persinger, Hans Letz and Felix Salmond. As a student, Miss DeLay supported herself by working as a baby sitter and playing the violin in restaurants, at weddings and in Broadway theater orchestras. But she also began performing as a recitalist and in a chamber ensemble, the Stuyvesant Trio, which included her sister Nellis, a cellist, and Helen Brainard, a pianist; and she toured Latin America as a member of Leopold Stokowski's All-American Youth Orchestra.         During a cross-country train journey at the end of the All-American Youth Orchestra tour in 1940, Miss DeLay met Edward Newhouse, a novelist and short story writer for The New Yorker. They were married early in 1941 after a courtship of four months. Mr. Newhouse survives Miss DeLay, as do their son, Jeffrey Newhouse, of Bronxville, and their daughter, Alison Dinsmore, of Boston, as well as four grandchildren.         Miss DeLay continued touring as a soloist and with the Stuyvesant Trio after her marriage, but by the mid-1940's she decided that she did not like performing. She briefly considered studying medicine but decided instead to return to the Juilliard School in 1946 for more violin studies. Her teacher was Galamian; two years later she became his assistant, both at Juilliard and at the summer camp he had established in 1944, Meadowmount.         It was Galamian's devotion to teaching that inspired Miss DeLay to give it a try. She maintained her association with the Juilliard School for the rest of her life and taught at Sarah Lawrence College from 1947 to 1987. Her other teaching associations included Meadowmount, Aspen, the University of Cincinnati, the Philadelphia College of the Performing Arts, the New England Conservatory, and the Royal College of Music in London.         By the late 1960's Miss DeLay's relationship with Galamian became strained, partly because of growing differences in their teaching methods and philosophies. But there were personal tensions as well, and their relationship ruptured entirely in 1970 when Miss DeLay telephoned Galamian to say that she would teach the following summer at Aspen instead of at his Meadowmount school. Galamian never spoke with Miss DeLay again, and when his demand that the Juilliard School fire her was not met, he told students who were working with both of them that they had to make a choice. Among those who chose Miss DeLay was Mr. Perlman.         ''With Galamian there was almost no room for give and take because he had a particular system that he applied to everybody,'' Mr. Perlman told Barbara Lourie Sand, the author of ''Teaching Genius: Dorothy DeLay and the Making of a Musician,'' a book about Miss DeLay, published in 2000. ''Miss DeLay was much more flexible, was much more into the person, and into their background, into what makes them tick. I would come and play for her, and if something was not quite right, it wasn't like she was going to kill me.         ''That's where we come to the differences between the two. She would ask questions about what you thought of particular phrases -- where the top of the phrase was, and so on. We would have a very friendly, interesting discussion about 'Why do you think it should sound like this?' and 'What do you think of that?' I was not quite used to this way of approaching things.''         With Miss DeLay's growing fame in the 1980's and 90's came detractors, including former students who complained that she was frequently late to lessons or that her essentially anti-authoritarian mode of teaching was actually lax and uninvolved. Still, by the late 1980's, her studio had become a soloist factory of sorts: a concertgoer reading her name in the program biography of a young performer could be assured of a high level of playing and often a particular kind of sound -- lush and beautifully burnished with a big but not overwhelming vibrato.         In addition to many honorary degrees, Miss DeLay received the National Medal of Arts in 1994, the National Music Council's American Eagle Award in 1995, the Sanford Medal from Yale University in 1997 and the Order of the Sacred Treasure from the Japanese Government in 1998.       
         Theresa Castro, who with her husband, Bernard, made Castro virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in New York and Florida, died on Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 85.         Her daughter, Bernadette Castro, the New York State parks commissioner, said she died at North Shore University Hospital. She lived in Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Castro used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the Castro Convertible Corporation. At first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. When Bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage.         As the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in New York and Florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations.         Success was measured by the innumerable Castro convertibles in apartments and houses. It was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in Lloyd Harbor, on Long Island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in Ocala, Fla.; a house in Fort Lauderdale; an apartment in Manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht.         But Mrs. Castro retained a homey style. After founding a country club in Marion County, Florida, she started a  golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. Her lasagna was legendary.         Her biggest success was surely her idea of using Bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas. The commercial -- shown 40,000 times in various forms -- was one of the first local advertisements to run on New York television and was said to be the first to feature a child.         Mrs. Castro was born Theresa Barabas on a dairy farm outside McKeesport, Pa., on Feb. 15, 1917. Her father was Hungarian and her mother Austrian. At the age of 13, Theresa entered a convent to fulfill a promise her mother had made to an order of nuns. She eventually left, promising her mother that she would ''do more good from outside the cloistered walls.''         As a child, the second of 14 children, she lived in poverty, sharing a bedroom with six siblings; she never spoke of ''the good old days,'' her daughter said. When she moved to New York at 17, she saw her first movie and met Mr. Castro, her ''dream man.'' They were married on Valentine's Day 1942.         Mr. Castro died in 1991. Their son, Bernard Jr., died after he was shot in his home in Fort Lauderdale in 1974. In addition to Bernadette, who lives in Lloyd Harbor, Mrs. Castro is survived by three brothers, Andrew Barabas, of Danbury, Conn., John Barabas, of Ocala, and Steve Barabas, of northern Florida. She is also survived by four sisters, Betty Bassett of Danbury, Barbara Castro of northern Florida, Julie Miller of Danbury and Mary Vitale of Connecticut and Florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         Her many charitable interests included the Golden Hills Academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. She helped found an interfaith chapel at the Florida School for the Deaf in St. Augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986.         Her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to Krause's Furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. One idea was the Ready Lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. Another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. It was called the Scotch and Sofa.       
         Shelley Mydans, a journalist who with her husband, the photographer Carl Mydans, covered the war in Asia in World War II and later wrote a novel based on their 21 months in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, died on Thursday in New Rochelle, N.Y. She was 86.         Mrs. Mydans was the author of three novels and co-author of a nonfiction book. She and her husband were Life magazine's first photographer-reporter team to cover the war.         Shelley Smith Mydans was born on May 20, 1915, in Palo Alto, Calif., the daughter of a professor of journalism at Stanford University.         After attending Stanford, she worked briefly for The Literary Digest and then joined the staff of Life magazine as a researcher-reporter. She met Mr. Mydans, a Life photographer, and they were married in 1938. In 1939 they were sent together to Europe. They stayed until the fall of France and then were sent to Chongqing, China, to report on the Sino-Japanese war and, after that, to the Western Pacific.         At the time of the attacks on Pearl Harbor and the Philippines, they were based in Manila and were taken prisoner when Japanese forces arrived. After nearly two years in captivity, they were returned to the United States in a prisoner exchange. Mrs. Mydans's first novel, ''The Open City,'' published in 1945, was based on the experiences of Americans captured by the Japanese.         After their release, she and her husband both returned to the Philippines. At the end of the war she moved to New York, becoming a commentator for a Time Inc. radio news program and writing for Time and Life; when Mr. Mydans was bureau chief for Time and Life in Tokyo, she also reported from there.         Her other books were ''Thomas,'' a novel based on the life of Thomas à Becket; ''The Vermilion Bridge,'' a novel about eighth-century Japan; and ''The Violent Peace,'' a report on wars, insurgency and terrorism  since World War II, which she wrote with Mr. Mydans.         Mrs. Mydans is survived by her husband; their son, Seth, a foreign correspondent for The New York Times; their daughter, Shelley, known as Misty, of Sacramento, Calif.; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.       
         Esther Afua Ocloo, who as a young woman turned a gift of less than a dollar into 12 jars of marmalade -- which she sold for a profit -- and went on to become one of Ghana's leading entrepreneurs and a prominent exponent of the role of women in economic development, died on Feb. 8 in Accra, Ghana. She was 83.         Her husband, Stephen, said she  died of pneumonia in Accra Military Hospital.         As the first chairwoman of Women's World Banking, Ms. Ocloo was one of the pioneers of microlending, the financing of homespun businesses, predominantly run by women, through very small loans, sometimes as little as $50. If a business prospers and the loan is repaid -- as more than 98 percent are -- then a larger loan is made available.         Large lending institutions give microlending institutions, like Women's World Banking, big loans of, say, $5 million. The money is then parceled out in small loans, at interest rates slightly higher than normal commercial bank rates, for enterprises as simple as drying fish.         Nancy Barry, president of Women's World Banking, said that 25 million people, three-quarters of them women, had received microloans in more than 40 less-developed countries. Half the loans are from Women's World Banking.         The idea was born at the 1975 Mexico City conference that proclaimed the United Nations Decade for Women. Ms. Ocloo found that ideas she had been developing with women in Ghana were also percolating elsewhere. The premise was simple: more than education, health care or family planning, women in poor countries need money in their pockets.         The other early leaders in the movement were Michaela Walsh, a New York investment banker, and Ela Bhatt, founder of a cooperative bank for illiterate women in India. They and several allies founded Women's World Banking in 1979 with Ms. Ocloo as chairwoman.         Ms. Barry said that concentrating on women made sense because they are discriminated against in borrowing; they do the majority of artisanal work and much of the farming, and they have a keener sense of the interdependence of generations.         Ms. Ocloo, in a speech in 1990, gave a starkly practical explanation.         ''Women must know that the strongest power in the world is economic power,'' she said. ''You cannot go and be begging to your husband for every little thing, but at the moment, that's what the majority of our women do.''         Esther Afua Nkulenu was born in  Peki-Dzake in the Volta region of Ghana on April 18, 1919. Her parents were poor farmers, but she was able to attend high school with the help of scholarships offered to young women by Cadbury, the chocolate company, which was a major buyer of Ghana's cocoa crop.         Her mother, with tears in her eyes, sent her off to Accra with just a sixpence. After graduating, she lived with relatives in the city. An aunt gave her 10 shillings, worth less than one United States dollar. She bought sugar, firewood, oranges and 12 jars, and made marmalade jam, which she sold for a shilling a jar.         ''I was ridiculed by all my classmates, who saw me hawking marmalade on the street like an uneducated street vendor,'' rather than seeking an office job, she said.         But she plowed her profits back into the business. She also took some of her marmalade to her old high school and won a contract to supply the entire school. Soon, school officials asked her to supply orange juice from orange trees on its grounds.         She next got a contract to supply juice to the military, but lacked the necessary funds to produce it. Though she had no collateral, she persuaded a bank to give her a loan on the basis of the contract. The result was her company, Nkulenu Industries, which grew to produce products like canned tomatoes and soup bases.         After six years, she had saved enough money to go to Britain to study food technology, preservation, nutrition and agriculture. She also learned leatherwork and lampshade-making in the hope of sharing the skills with rural women back home.         Even as she continued running her own company upon her return, she devoted more and more of her time to improving women's economic situation. For example, she established her own program on a farm to train women in agriculture, preparing and preserving food products and making handicrafts.         She paid for the program in part with her half of the Africa Prize, a $100,000 award she split with Olusegun Obasanjo, the current president of Nigeria, in 1990. It was presented by the Hunger Project for their leadership in working to end hunger in Africa.         She liked to keep things simple, as when she taught business management skills to women involved in cooking and selling food on the streets.         ''I have taught them to cost the things they sell and determine their profits,'' she said. ''You know what we found? We found that a woman selling rice and stew on the side of the street is making more money than most women in office jobs -- but they are not taken seriously.''         Ms. Ocloo, who always wore bright African clothes and loved to cook traditional meals, preferred to be known as Auntie Ocloo, in the Ghanaian tradition. She usually began meetings of bankers and others with a prayer, and often ended them with a song: ''We Are Wonderful.''         The day she entered the hospital she gave a speech urging women to carry on her campaign for micro-lending. Days before she died, she was on the phone from her hospital bed to governmental officials arguing that microloans, rather than grants, should be specified in Ghana's new budget.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her sister, Georgina Nkulenu; her daughter, Vincentia Canacco; her sons Vincent Malm, Christian Biassey and Stephen Jr., and six grandchildren.         She once said her children complained that the women she trained competed against her.         ''I don't listen,'' she said. ''My main goal is to help my fellow women. If they make better marmalade than me, I deserve the competition.''       
         Elaine Crispen Sawyer, a trusted aide to the former first lady Nancy Reagan who parried with the news media over things like Mrs. Reagan's borrowed gowns and her consultations with an astrologer, died Tuesday.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, relatives said. She was 62 and lived in Alexandria, Va.         Mrs. Sawyer, a public relations specialist, was at Mrs. Reagan's side throughout the Reagan presidency, serving four years as the first lady's special assistant and four years as her press secretary. She played an important role in the small team that  shaped Mrs. Reagan's trademark ''just say no'' to drugs campaign.         An employee who became a loyal friend and confidante of Mrs. Reagan, Mrs. Sawyer complained that the news media were quick to find fault with the first lady.         As press secretary, she was called upon to explain Mrs. Reagan's consultations with a California astrologer, Joan Quigley. When Mrs. Reagan did not report the loans of expensive dresses by top designers, Mrs. Sawyer was out front to concede that the first lady ''broke her own rule.''         Mrs. Reagan called Mrs. Sawyer ''a dear friend'' who shared many joyful and sad moments, including the times when Mrs. Reagan learned she had breast cancer and when her mother died.         ''It's hard to believe that she won't be here tomorrow when I want to pick up the phone and just catch up on the news,'' Mrs. Reagan said.         Born near Detroit, Mrs. Sawyer moved to California at 25 to work in public relations under Michael K. Deaver, who later became President Reagan's deputy chief of staff. She was deeply impressed by Mr. Reagan's presence and joined his campaign for governor, then moved to Washington with the Reagans in 1980, said her daughter, Cheryl Crispen of Alexandria.         In addition to Ms. Crispen, survivors include Mrs. Sawyer's husband of 10 years, George A. Sawyer of Alexandria; three stepchildren, Nancy Sawyer, Jeffrey Sawyer and Debra Moulton; and six grandchildren.       
         Linda Boreman, the woman once known as Linda Lovelace, who starred in one of the first feature-length pornography movies, ''Deep Throat,'' and who later denounced it as depicting her ''rape,'' died on Monday in Denver. She was 53.         The cause was injuries from a car accident on April 3, her family said.         The 62-minute film, released in 1972, made money so fast that its producers joked they had to weigh their receipts each day; by many estimates it earned more than $600 million. It cost just $30,000 to make, according to Variety. Ms. Boreman said she was paid nothing.         ''Deep Throat'' and Linda Lovelace became household words and figured in three dozen books and 18 published songs. During Watergate, Washington Post reporters called their secret source Deep Throat.         But Ms. Boreman testified about the dangers of pornography before Congress, courts and city councils in the 1980's, and became a poster child for feminists like Gloria Steinem, who wrote an introduction to her 1986 book with Mike McGrady, ''Out of Bondage.''         Ms. Boreman insisted that she had made the movie only because her husband at the time, Chuck Traynor, threatened her with violence. ''I knew the feeling of a gun to my back and hearing the click, never knowing when there was going to be a real bullet,'' she said in her 1980 autobiography, ''Ordeal,'' written with Mr. McGrady.         Linda Boreman was born in the Bronx on Jan. 10, 1949, and moved to Yonkers when she was 3. Her father was a police officer, and her mother held Tupperware parties.         ''How does she do it?'' Vincent Canby asked in an article in The New York Times. ''The film has less to do with the manifold pleasures of sex than with physical engineering.''         She told of literally escaping from Mr. Traynor, who was already seeing his second wife, Marilyn Chambers, another pornography star. She hid out in different hotels for weeks, then began appearing in Las Vegas and London in skimpy costumes, drawing a smattering of publicity. The movie career for which she had hoped never materialized.         She later married Larry Marchiano. They divorced in 1996. She is survived by their children, a daughter, Lindsay, and a son, Dominic; a sister, Barbara Boreman; and three grandchildren.         The family lived on welfare when Mr. Marchiano was unemployed, and Ms. Boreman had a liver transplant in 1987. After they moved to Denver in 1990, she worked at low-paying jobs.         In recent years, she enjoyed the reception she received at memorabilia shows, said Eric Danville, author of ''The Complete Linda Lovelace'' (Power Process Publishing, 2001). ''People would tell her how much they loved her 100 times a day,'' he said.         Mr. Danville also recalled watching ''Deep Throat'' with her nine months ago. It was the first time she had seen it from start to finish.         ''I don't see what the big deal was,'' she said.       
         Helen Levitov Sobell, a voice in the struggle to spare Julius and Ethel Rosenberg and free their co-defendant, Morton Sobell, her husband, died on April 15 in Redwood City, Calif. She was 84.         She had long been in declining health, suffering from Alzheimer's disease, said her daughter, Sydney Gurewitz Clemens.         The espionage trial of the Rosenbergs prompted an international furor that their execution in 1953 did not still. Mr. Sobell, who did not testify, was sentenced to 30 years in prison. He was released in 1969 and lives in San Francisco.         Morton and Helen Sobell had fled to Mexico in 1950 with their infant son, Mark, and her daughter, trying to find passage to Europe but lacking passports. They were abducted by armed men, taken to the United States border and turned over to agents of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.         From then on, Mrs. Sobell pursued worldwide pleas, first for the Rosenbergs' lives and then for Mr. Sobell, who always denied any knowledge of a spy ring. He maintained that he had taken his family to Mexico because he had lied about belonging to the Communist Party.         Mrs. Sobell spoke at rallies in the United States and abroad. She lobbied the powerful, directed picket lines and coordinated a large network of volunteers and supporters, including Pablo Picasso and Bertrand Russell.         Documents since obtained under the Freedom of Information Act show that she was singled out for harassment in the McCarthy era because Director J. Edgar Hoover of the F.B.I. was worried about the Sobell clamor. The authorities also suspected Mrs. Sobell of being the real cause of their inability to exact information about espionage from her husband.         After Mr. Sobell was released from prison, Mrs. Sobell studied system theory and received a doctorate in computer education from Teachers College at Columbia University in 1972. The marriage ended in 1980.         Helen Levitov Sobell was born in Washington and trained as a teacher at Wilson Teachers College in Washington. In World War II she worked at the Bureau of Standards as a spectrometer technician. In 1945 she divorced her first husband, Clarence D. Gurewitz, and married Mr. Sobell.         Both then worked at the General Electric Company in Schenectady, N.Y., while she studied physics at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. After moving to New York City in 1947, she was awarded a master's degree at Columbia in 1950.         Besides her daughter, a resident of San Francisco, and her son, who lives in Menlo Park, N.J., Mrs. Sobell is survived by a sister, Dr. Edith Garduk of Bethesda, Md.; two brothers, David Levitov of Silver Spring, Md., and Joseph Levitov of Boca Raton, Fla.; five grandchildren, and two great-grandsons.       
         Ruth Handler, creator of the Barbie doll, one of the world's best-selling toys and one that became an icon of American popular culture, an artistic muse and a lightning rod of feminist politics, died on Saturday at a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 85.         Mrs. Handler experienced complications after having colon surgery several months ago, said her husband, Elliot.         In 1959 when she invented Barbie, a busty figure with platinum-blond hair and piercing blue eyes, Mrs. Handler created the country's first mass-marketed adult-looking doll for girls -- and an image that would later be attacked by feminists as a symbol of objectification and repression. Critics said the doll gave girls misguided goals, whether for their careers or for their own physical development.         Mrs. Handler, though, seemed unmoved, her husband said. ''It really didn't bother her,'' he said. ''She thought they were wrong.''         Mrs. Handler named the doll after her daughter. Barbie's male counterpart, Ken, named after Mrs. Handler's son, soon followed. More than one billion Barbies have been sold in 150 countries.         Barbie was a particularly pioneering creation because in 1959 innocent, cherubic baby dolls dominated the toy market. And Barbie's fly-off-the-shelf popularity transformed the sleepy company that sold the doll, Mattel Inc., into a postwar success story.         Mrs. Handler was a founder of Mattel and helped run the company for 30 years, until she and her husband, then co-chairmen, resigned in 1975 amid a scandal.         ''Every little girl needed a doll through which to project herself into her dream of her future,'' Mrs. Handler said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''If she was going to do role playing of what she would be like when she was 16 or 17, it was a little stupid to play with a doll that had a flat chest. So I gave it beautiful breasts.''         Barbie was conceived as a teenage fashion model, and her first outfits were named for her various activities, according to M. G. Lord, author of ''Forever Barbie: The Unauthorized Biography of a Real Doll.'' Early outfits included ''Friday Night Date'' and ''Sorority Meeting.''         And Barbie kept pace with the times. During Camelot, she sported a Jacqueline Kennedy hairdo. During the civil rights movement, Mattel created Barbie's first black friend, ''Colored Francie.''         But not until the 1970's, as the criticism from feminists materialized, did her career choices -- and her outfits -- begin to change to include a doctor, astronaut and veterinarian, among others.         A chief objection of feminists, including the National Organization for Women, was that Barbie's figure created unrealistic expectations for young girls that could lead to low self-esteem. People often joked that Barbie's measurements were not humanly possible. But in fact it was determined that if the 11 1/2-inch doll were 5-foot-6, her measurements would be 39-21-33. One academic expert calculated that a woman's chances of having Barbie's figure were less than 1 in 100,000.         In her 1994 autobiography, ''Dream Doll: The Ruth Handler Story,'' Mrs. Handler wrote: ''My whole philosophy of Barbie was that through the doll, the little girl could be anything she wanted to be. Barbie always represented the fact that a woman has choices.''         In 1978 Mrs. Handler and several other former officers of Mattel were indicted on charges of fraud and false reporting to the Securities and Exchange Commission. She pleaded no contest to the charges, which investigators said resulted from attempts to influence stock prices, and was fined and sentenced to community service.         Mrs. Handler, though, had already embarked on a second career, starting a company that made prosthetic breasts for cancer survivors. In talking about her two careers, Mrs. Handler was known to say, ''I've lived my life from breast to breast.''         She was found to have breast cancer in 1970 and had her left breast removed. She said it was impossible to find an acceptable replacement breast. ''Until now,'' she said in 1977, ''every breast that was sold was used interchangeably for the right or the left side. There has never been a shoemaker who made one shoe and forced you to put both your right and your left foot in it.''         After developing a line of artificial breasts made of foam and silicon that she called ''Nearly Me,'' she became a well-traveled advocate for early detection of breast cancer, at a time when there was little public discussion of the disease. Mrs. Handler, who once described herself as a ''marketing genius,'' was often known during those years to open her blouse at interviews and ask a reporter or photographer to feel her breasts to determine which was real.         She ran the breast prosthesis company, Ruthton Corporation, for 15 years, fitting women, including Betty Ford, for the artificial breasts herself, before selling it to a division of Kimberly-Clark, her husband said. But she never made much of a profit.         ''She was working on that from the heart,'' Mr. Handler said.         The youngest of 10 children of Polish immigrants, Ruth Mosko was the daughter of a blacksmith who had settled in Denver. She left Denver for Hollywood at 19 and stayed, marrying her high school boyfriend, Mr. Handler, who became a specialist in designing plastic products.         The two, along with a short-term partner, founded Mattel in 1945. Inspired by her daughter's fascination with paper dolls that looked like teenagers or adults and came with multiple outfits and accessories, Mrs. Handler decided to produce a doll that she described as looking more or less like a real teenager.         The doll she created resembled a sex toy called Lilli, which Mrs. Handler had seen on a trip to Germany. After she battled years of prudish resistance to the Barbie concept among the male executives at Mattel, the doll was finally cleared for production. And in 1959, wearing a zebra-striped maillot and tall stiletto heels, Barbie made her debut at the American Toy Fair in New York.         Long After Mrs. Handler left Mattel and turned away from toys, Barbie remained wildly popular, not only as a toy, but as a touchstone of American culture. Barbie, sometimes wearing outfits and hairdos that might send shudders up Mrs. Handler's spine, has been the subject of art exhibitions, an Andy Warhol painting, a television documentary, books and Web sites, including Barbie.com and AdiosBarbie.com, a site dedicated to improving women's body images.         Mrs. Handler's son, Ken, died of a brain tumor in 1994. She is survived by her husband of 63 years; a daughter, Barbara Segal of Los Angeles; a brother, Aaron Mosko of Denver; five grandchildren; and one great-granddaughter.       
         Libby Hillman, a cooking instructor and cookbook writer, died on April 6 in Bennington, Vt. She was 82 and lived in Whitingham, Vt.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Mrs. Hillman, who was a pianist and piano teacher early in her career, taught adults cooking in the school system of Great Neck, N.Y., for 29 years as well as in Vermont and elsewhere.         Her books include ''Lessons in Gourmet Cooking'' (1963) and ''The Best From Libby Hillman's Kitchen'' (1993).         She was born Libby Gerber in Manhattan, and grew up there and in Brooklyn. She graduated from what is now Juilliard School.         She is survived by her husband, Herbert E. Hillman, whom she married in 1940; two sons, David, of Manhattan and Donald, of Chestnut Hill, Mass.; a daughter, Betty Hillman of Wilmington, Vt.; and three grandchildren.       
         Wilma Cannon Fairbank, a historian of Chinese art and architecture, died on April 4 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 92.         Mrs. Fairbank had studied fine arts at Radcliffe College and was an apprentice to the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera before she traveled to Beijing in 1932 to marry John King Fairbank. Then a Rhodes scholar and a lecturer at Qinghua University, John Fairbank later became the leading scholar of modern China in the United States.         While in China, Mrs. Fairbank visited the remote countryside. There she studied Buddhist cave temples, ancient stone tomb carvings and bronze vessels, using her research to write scholarly articles on the methods and materials of early Chinese artists.         Her article on Han period tomb murals in 1941, in which she explained how she had been able to restore a crumbling ancient tomb, drew scholarly recognition and was translated into Chinese. The article earned Mrs. Fairbank membership in China's Institute for Research in Chinese Architecture, a professional organization.         Returning to the United States in 1936, she and her husband settled in Cambridge, Mass., where Mr. Fairbank was appointed to Harvard's department of history. During World War II, the Fairbanks moved to Washington, where she became the first employee of the China section of the State Department's cultural relations division, which dealt with scholarly and cultural exchange.         From 1945 to 1947, Mrs. Fairbank was cultural attaché to the United States Embassy in Chongqing and later, the nationalist capital, Nanjing.         In 1995 she published ''Liang and Lin: Partners in Exploring China's Architectural Past,'' a biography of a Chinese couple who were groundbreaking scholars.         Wilma Cannon Fairbank was born on April 23, 1909, in Cambridge, Mass., the oldest child of Dr. Walter B. Cannon, a professor at the Harvard Medical School, and the author Cornelia James Cannon.         Mrs. Fairbank's husband died in 1991. She is survived by two daughters, Laura Fairbank Haynes of Arlington, Mass., and Holly Fairbank Tuck of New York City; a sister, Marian Cannon Schlesinger of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, Dr. Bradford Cannon of Lincoln, Mass.; and four grandchildren.       
         Ruth Fertel, who found a New Orleans restaurant called Chris Steak House in the classified ads and from it built one of the largest steakhouse chains in the world, died Tuesday in New Orleans. She was 75.         The cause was lung cancer, her company said.         Ms. Fertel came to the food business with no restaurant experience and even less culinary training. She prided herself on following her instincts with her Ruth's Chris Steak House chain.         She ignored advice from her lawyer and banker when she bought her first restaurant, and she kept the cumbersome name even as the business grew far beyond New Orleans. Today there are 82 Ruth's Chris Steak Houses in the United States and abroad, with annual sales of $328 million.         Each restaurant varies slightly in décor, depending on the location, but all cook prime steaks at extremely high heat, in a broiler Ms. Fertel designed that reaches 1,800 degrees. And all serve the steaks topped with a swath of butter for maximum flavor, as she insisted.         Ms. Fertel (pronounced fer TELL), who was divorced, was working as a lab technician at Tulane School of Medicine and looking for a way to finance her two sons' college education when she spotted a restaurant advertised for sale in 1965. In what she described as ''a case of blind ambition,'' she mortgaged her house for $22,000 to buy the place from Chris Matulich.         She was so naïve, she said, that she asked for a loan only large enough to pay for the space; the bank insisted that she take out a few thousand dollars more to buy food. She had to teach herself how to butcher.         Six months after opening, she had taken in more than twice as much as her annual salary at Tulane.         According to an interview in Fortune magazine in 1998, Mr. Matulich had granted Ms. Fertel the rights to the restaurant's long-established name as long as she kept the original location. When a fire forced her to move in 1976, she wound up appending her name to his and creating a tongue-tangler that one restaurant critic said would make a good sobriety test if repeated three times fast.         ''I've always hated the name,'' Ms. Fertel told Fortune's reporter. ''But we've always managed to work around it.''         Ms. Fertel came out of a long and unusual New Orleans tradition: an acceptance of strong women as restaurateurs, like Ella Brennan of Commander's Palace, Leah Chase of Dooky Chase and Susan Spicer of Bayona. But Ms. Fertel also catered to the good-old-boy network that flourishes in Louisiana, and from the beginning her restaurant attracted local politicians as well as athletes, businessmen and reporters.         Edwin W. Edwards, a former governor of Louisiana, described Ms. Fertel to The Associated Press as ''someone that every politician in this state knew and respected.''         She also apparently had the characteristic New Orleans attitude toward the rituals of death. According to The A.P., in 1999 she gave a lavish party to unveil the mausoleum she and a friend had bought for $500,000 in Lake Lawn Metairie Cemetery.         Ruth Udstad was born in 1927 to an insurance salesman and a kindergarten teacher. At 19, she earned a degree in chemistry from Louisiana State University, and she taught briefly at John McNeese Junior College in Lake Charles, La., before her marriage, which ended after 14 years. She is survived by her sons, Randy and Jerry, both of New Orleans, and seven grandchildren.         Ruth's Chris began expanding when she granted her first franchise in 1977, in Baton Rouge, the state capital. The first Ruth's in Manhattan opened in the Theater District in 1993. In 1999, Madison Dearborn Partners of Chicago acquired a majority interest in the chain.         Ms. Fertel was told she had lung cancer in 2000 but remained involved in the company until she was hospitalized last Friday.         After starting in a three-martini world, Ms. Fertel's business thrived through both the carbo-loading and fat-fearing eras and now benefits from the new appetite for protein, particularly in the form of hulking steaks dripping butter. In an interview with New Orleans magazine in 1997, she insisted that the beef business was virtually impervious to health trends.         ''People always go on a diet 'Monday,' '' she said. ''On Friday: 'I'm going on a diet Monday because I'm going to two restaurants this weekend.' On Sunday they renegotiate.''       
         Lenore Patricia Kroh Freudenheim, a flower arranging expert and author of four books on the subject, died on April 26 in Longboat Key, Fla. She was 97 and lived in Longboat Key.         The holder of diplomas from four schools of Japanese flower arranging, she taught and lectured widely and explained her philosophy in ''A Japanese Flower Arranging Notebook,'' published in 1963. Her books, all published by Doubleday & Company under her maiden name, Patricia Kroh, also included ''Design With Flowers Unlimited'' (1959), ''Contemporary Table Settings'' (1966) and ''A New World of Flower Arrangement'' (1969).         She is survived by a daughter, Diane Freudenheim Lange of Danbury, Conn.; a son, Milton, who is a reporter for The New York Times; seven grandchildren; and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Rose Ellis Matzkin, national president of Hadassah, the women's Zionist organization of America, from 1972 to 1976, died on Monday in a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 88.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Matzkin was the daughter of Louis and Jennie Cohen. She attended New Haven State Teachers College, taught for a time and went on to hold a number of posts in Hadassah and in other Zionist organizations.         She married Dr. Max N. Matzkin in 1934; he died before her.         Survivors include a son, Dr. Michael Matzkin; a daughter, Hannah Lavine; four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Niki de Saint Phalle, a Franco-American artist internationally known for her colorful, monumental, cartoonlike sculptures and environments, died on Tuesday in San Diego, Calif. She was 71.         The cause was pulmonary failure after an illness of several months, said Harry Mathews, the writer and her first husband.         A heroine to feminism before the modern movement even emerged, Ms. de Saint Phalle first made her mark in Paris in the early 60's when she was associated with the Nouveaux Réalistes, a group of avant-gardists that included the sculptors Christo, Arman and Jean Tinguely. Their antic, absurdist works challenged conventional ideas about art-making in ways that echoed the earlier Dada movement.         Ms. de Saint Phalle became notorious for what she called ''target paintings,'' at which darts were thrown, and then for actual ''shooting paintings'' and sculptures. In galleries, she would use a .22-caliber rifle to shoot at plaster sculptures in which she had embedded bags of paint, causing color to splatter all over.         Ms. de Saint Phalle went on to produce a far different kind of art, an amalgam of Pop, Surrealism, Folk and outsider art that she prolifically realized in sculptures, paintings, prints and large public installations. Inspired in the mid-60's by a visit from the wife of Larry Rivers, Clarice Rivers, who was then pregnant, Ms. de Saint Phalle created the first of what would become an extensive population of ''Nanas.'' (Nana is a mildly rude French term for woman, comparable to broad.) They were bulbous, archetypal maternal figures like Mexican piñatas painted in bold colors and decorated with crisp, cartoon outlines.         In contrast with the aggressive Conceptualism of her early performance works, the art for which she became best known seemed to flow from an endlessly fertile, visionary imagination.         The Nanas gave birth to legions of fanciful humanoids, animals, plants and monsters and a trend away from the refinement of individual objects toward the creation of whole, fantastic worlds that would be most fully achieved in ambitious public works like Surrealistic amusement parks. Made of cement and produced on a gigantic scale, the Nanas became houses that visitors could enter, and surrounding grounds became teeming, part-organic, part-architectural mazes. At once avant-garde and populist, Ms. de Saint Phalle's art had the unusual ability to appeal to a wide range of viewers, from art-world professionals to children.         In the late 1970's, on acreage in southwestern Tuscany made available by wealthy friends, Ms. de Saint Phalle began her most ambitious project, a sprawling sculpture garden featuring 22 large sculptures based on the fortune-telling Tarot cards. With its wildly grotesque forms decorated by ceramic tiles, glass and mirrors, it calls to mind the architecture of Antonio Gaudí, whose work made a lasting impression on Ms. de Saint Phalle when she first encountered it in the 1950's. Financing it in part through the sale of a perfume called Niki de Saint Phalle, which she created for the Jacqueline Cochran company, Ms. de Saint Phalle worked on the Tarot Garden for 20 years. It opened to the public in 1998.         Catherine Marie-Agnès Fal de Saint Phalle was born into a wealthy family on Oct. 29, 1930, at Neuilly-sur-Seine, a Paris suburb, but was partly raised in New York, where her parents moved after the crash of 1929, and educated at the Brearley School, among several others. She told of being thrown out of Brearley for painting the fig leaves on the school artworks red.         At 18 she eloped with Mr. Mathews, and two years later the couple moved to France, where she began to paint after a nervous breakdown at age 23. She was mostly a self-taught artist. Her first solo exhibition took place in St. Gallen, Switzerland, in 1956, but she did not begin to show her work regularly until 1961.         Divorced from Mr. Mathews in 1960, she began a relationship with Jean Tinguely, the Swiss sculptor known for his kinetic, mechanical sculptures. They were married in 1971 and she collaborated with him on many projects. Although they lived separately after their marriage, their partnership lasted until his death in 1991. Ms. de Saint Phalle returned to the United States in 1994 to settle in La Jolla, in San Diego, partly because of her frail health.         In addition to producing public works in cities from Jerusalem to San Diego, Ms. de Saint Phalle had many museum exhibitions. The Nassau County Museum of Fine Arts in New York assembled her first American retrospective in 1987, and a larger retrospective was organized by the Kunst und Austellunghalle in Bonn in 1992. In 1994, an institution dedicated to her work, the Niki Museum, opened in Nasu, Japan. In 2000 she won a $140,000 Praemium Imperiale Award given by the Japan Art Association.         Ms. de Saint Phalle is survived by a brother, John de Saint Phalle, of Florida; a daughter, Laura Duke, of Paris; a son, Philip Mathews, of New York; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Nancy White, the white-gloved editor of Harper's Bazaar during the 1960's, when it captured the spirit of the decade with evocative photographs of models in bikinis, boots and big watches, not to mention spacesuits, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Miss White edited Harper's from 1958 to 1971, at a time when there were only two major women's fashion magazines in America. The other, Vogue, was headed by Diana Vreeland, a far more visible personality.         Her magazine reflected the cultural upheavals of the 1960's, as did she, up to a point: through her three marriages, she insisted on being called Miss White, reflecting the stylishly independent image she strove to project.         ''There were not a lot of female businesspeople then,'' said Katharine Delahaye Paine, her daughter. ''She felt it was important to create the right image.''         When she assumed the top editorial job at Harper's Bazaar in 1958, Miss White jotted down the words she hoped would describe her magazine. As given in the book ''Harper's Bazaar: 100 Years of the American Female'' (Random House, 1967), they were: ''authority, awareness, wit, spirit, surprise, curiosity, intelligence, timing, food for thought, vitality, balance and youth.''         She emphasized photographs -- many by Richard Avedon and Hiro -- that told the story of a new era. They varied from a model posed in front of a missile at Cape Canaveral, to an ethereal picture of a woman in a gown floating in a glass ball, to a model in a shimmering body stocking. Suzy Parker posed in one of the first fashion layouts featuring the bikini.         ''She was one of the grandes dames of her era,'' the designer John Weitz said yesterday. ''She brought taste, charm and a sense of proportion to the game.''         Nancy White was born in Brooklyn on July 25, 1916. Her father was in publishing and became general manager of Hearst magazines.         She attended the Madeira School in Greenway, Va., where she and Katharine Graham, who was to become publisher of The Washington Post, became lifelong friends.         She left Madeira to work during the Depression, her daughter said. At 15, she worked as an errand girl with a magazine, according to an interview with her in The New York Mirror in 1957. (She did not name the magazine.)         She returned to the boarding school, and after graduation became an editorial assistant, or ''glorified errand girl,'' in her words, with the magazine Pictorial Review. Her next job, which lasted 16 years, was with Good Housekeeping magazine, where she started as an assistant in the fashion department and left as fashion editor.         She joined Harper's as an assistant editor in 1957 and was appointed editor at the beginning of 1958. She was chosen by the previous editor, Carmel Snow, who happened to be her aunt. Diana Vreeland had been another candidate for the top job; she promptly quit. In 1962, Mrs. Vreeland joined Vogue, becoming a legend in the fashion world, and not incidentally Miss White's principal competitor.         Under Miss White, Harper's was aimed at stylish women in Des Moines and Omaha as well as in New York and San Francisco. In one issue, 14 pages by Hiro showed models' bodies seeming to disintegrate beneath colorful prints. Yet in the same issue, there was page after black-and-white page of elegantly understated suits and coats.         Her comments on pantsuits in a 1964 interview in The New York Times reflected the balance she sought between modernity and moderation. Although she would not wear one to the office herself, she said, pantsuits would be all right for her staff members if they wore ''perfect accessories.''         Miss White resigned in 1971 after James W. Brady, formerly publisher of Women's Wear Daily, was appointed publisher and editorial director of Harper's. Mr. Brady said it was Hearst's decision for him to modernize the magazine.         ''In all candor, I don't think Nancy White was as significant as Vreeland,'' said Mr. Brady, the author and columnist, who succeeded Miss White as editor of Harper's. ''She always seemed to be wearing white gloves with her hat firmly in place.''         After her resignation, Miss White advised Bergdorf Goodman on fashion for two years and devoted much of the rest of her life to charities, including Lighthouse for the Blind and the public television station WNET.         She was first married to Clarence Dauphinot, founder of Deltec International, then to Ralph D. Paine Jr., publisher of Fortune magazine, and then George K. Thompson, her high school sweetheart. The first two marriages ended in divorce, and Mr. Thompson died in 1996.         She is survived by two daughters, Ms. Paine of Durham, N.H., and Gillette Piper of Coral Gables, Fla.; a stepdaughter, Mimi Thompson of Manhattan; a sister, Carmel Eitt of King George, Va.; a brother, John Michael White of Delray Beach, Fla.; three grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         In an interview with The New York Times Magazine in 1972, Miss White said she did not own a little black dress. But she had a color scheme for each of her four homes.         ''In Manhattan, I'm sort of white and beige,'' she said. ''In Connecticut, I'm yellow and orange and bright green. In New Hampshire, I'm red and white and navy. In Vermont, I'm beige and red.''       
         Edna Mae Robinson, the Cotton Club star who was once married to the boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson, died in her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 86.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her son, Ray Robinson II.         Ernestine Holly was born in 1915 to a prominent Miami family, and moved to New York City when she was 5.         Precocious on and off the dance floor, she graduated from high school at 14 and found work as a dancer, touring Europe with Duke Ellington and Cab Calloway in the 1930's. At the Cotton Club, in Harlem, she was known for dancing atop an enormous drum.         In 1940, she met her future husband -- also a local celebrity -- silently and anonymously at a local pool.         The up-and-coming boxer Walker Smith Jr. -- soon to be nicknamed Sugar Ray Robinson after his borrowed identification card and smooth fighting style -- could not help noticing the preening young woman as she sauntered poolside. So he pushed her in.         Edna Mae, who could not swim, was not impressed. But she gave Mr. Robinson a second chance at a Harlem nightclub some months later, when they were formally introduced. They were married in 1943.         During their 19-year marriage, while Mr. Robinson became a five-time world middleweight champion, Mrs. Robinson stopped performing to travel with her husband. She encouraged his natty style and shared his penchant for flash as they spent and gave away Mr. Robinson's $4 million in winnings. (The couple drove a flamingo-pink Cadillac.)         In the 1950's, they owned businesses covering much of Seventh Avenue from 123rd to 124th streets, including Edna Mae's Lingerie Shop and Sugar Ray's Cafe.         After the couple divorced in 1962, she revived her show business career, appearing in television variety shows, cabaret productions and, briefly, on the New York stage in an all-black version of ''Born Yesterday.'' She never remarried.         Mr. Robinson died in 1989. Mrs. Robinson is survived by her son and five grandchildren.       
         Shirley Hayes, who waged a long battle -- called quixotic by some, psychotic by others -- that eventually succeeded in banning cars from Washington Square Park in Manhattan, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 89.         She marshaled children in strollers, including her own four sons, to press the case that Greenwich Village's only significant park had no business being a bus turnaround, much less being cut in half by a four-lane road.         She collected 16,000 signatures and the endorsements of politicians, newspapers, 12 parent-teacher associations and the Lions Club. When others sought some middle ground, say a smaller road, Mrs. Hayes spurned deal making.         ''When Shirley refused to compromise, I told her she was turning into a crackpot,'' said Edward I. Koch, the former mayor of New York, in an interview with McCall's magazine in 1967. At the time he was a lawyer living in the Village.         ''I thought it was unreasonable to expect the city to cut a major artery and detour traffic through narrow streets,'' Mr. Koch said, ''but she proved her goal was not unrealistic.''         The long-running drama included some legendary New Yorkers: Robert Moses, the powerful official who demanded the biggest road possible, was her arch enemy. Eleanor Roosevelt, the former first lady who had once lived on Washington Square, was her illustrious supporter. Carmine DeSapio, the leader of Tammany Hall, was the éminence grise who at the final moment gave the quiet nod to her position.         ''This was where the tide turned against the indiscriminate taking of parkland for automotive purposes,'' said Henry J. Stern, the former city parks commissioner, who last year put up a sign in Washington Square honoring the event.         Mrs. Hayes was born Shirley Zak on June 15, 1912, in Chicago. She attended the University of Wisconsin and studied painting at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago and acting at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She moved to New York in 1932 to pursue a career in acting. In 1936, she appeared in Leslie Howard's ''Hamlet,'' which was making Broadway history by competing with Sir John Gielgud's ''Hamlet.'' She played a lady in waiting and met her husband, James, during the production; he played a pallbearer.         They had four sons: Christopher, who lives in Manhattan and Los Angeles, and his twin, Kerry, who lives in Toronto, Timothy, of Manhattan and East Hampton, and Dennis, of Rio de Janeiro and Manhattan. In addition to her sons, she is survived by four grandchildren.         Mrs. Hayes, who was often busy entertaining clients for her husband, who had gone into advertising, also became involved in other neighborhood causes, like fighting the large apartment houses that Robert Moses eventually built south of Washington Square. Because she frequently took her sons to Washington Square Park, she leapt into the fight in 1952, when Mr. Moses proposed building a 48-foot roadway through it. The road -- which would have linked Fifth Avenue on the north side of the park to West Broadway on the south -- would have wiped out some playgrounds. ''A few women got together to say no, no, no,'' Mrs. Hayes said in an interview with The Villager, a neighborhood paper, last fall.         The debate took many turns; one big struggle was over what to do with the buses that already used the park as a turnaround. Eventually politicians came up with the idea of using a smaller road as a compromise. The original proposal for a below-the-ground road was changed to ground level. But Mrs. Hayes had decided she would accept nothing less than no road through the park, and no vehicles of any kind in it, including the buses.         ''She took the extreme position,'' said Anthony Dapolito, owner of Vesuvio Bakery and long a leader in Greenwich Village politics. ''She and the mothers kept insisting and wouldn't give up.''         On April 9, 1959, the city's Board of Estimate, the body that then governed the city's spending and land use, voted to oust cars entirely, shortly after Mr. DeSapio, always attuned to opinion in the Village, had passed the word that he wanted them out.         In her 1961 book, ''The Life and Death of Great American Cities,'' Jane Jacobs noted the courage of the position taken by Mrs. Hayes and her allies: ''They advocated eliminating the existing road, that is, closing the park to all automobile traffic -- but at the same time, not widening the perimeter roads either. In short, they proposed closing off a roadbed without compensating for it.''         Ms. Jacobs wrote that traffic did not become unmanageable, and that more of the low-scale profile of Greenwich Village was preserved. Others suggested that the defeat of the road represented the first nail in the coffin of Mr. Moses's plan for a Lower Manhattan expressway. The park road would have fed into the Moses freeway, which he planned to link the bridges and tunnels to Brooklyn and New Jersey.         Mrs. Hayes was divorced in 1965 and went to work as a classical radio disc jockey on WNYC's ''While the City Sleeps'' and other programs. She also worked with Mayor John V. Lindsay, for whom she campaigned, on making the city friendlier to movie companies. She was a charter member of the National Organization for Women.         Correction:  May 15, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on Saturday about Shirley Hayes, who successfully fought a road through Washington Square Park in Greenwich Village, reversed two words in the title of a book by the urban planning critic Jane Jacobs, which praised her. It is ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' not ''Life and Death.''       
         Prof. Florence G. Roswell, who spent more than half a century teaching and writing, particularly about ways to diagnose and overcome reading disabilities, died May 4 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 97.         A former director of the reading clinic at the City College of New York, she remained active into her 90's, with several of her books and manuals published or reissued within the last few years.         She worked with Dr. Jeanne S. Chall, another leading expert on teaching children to read, to devise instructional materials to guide teachers. First published in the 1950's, these materials had a revival in the 1990's and remain in print. Dr. Chall died in 1999.         In 1997, Educators Publishing Company reissued the ''Roswell-Chall Auditory Blending Test,'' and the ''Roswell-Chall Diagnostic Reading Test of Word Analysis Skills.''         Florence Garfunkel Roswell was born in Manhattan in June 1904. She entered New York University at 16, majoring in English literature; she graduated in 1924.         She taught second grade for several years while taking graduate education courses at Teachers College. When children in her classroom were having trouble learning to read, she asked them to come to school earlier and stay later to help them catch up.         City College offered her a teaching fellowship in 1942, asking her to test children with various reading problems and to supervise student teachers. At the time, conventional wisdom regarding reading disabilities was that a child's difficulties were rooted in emotional problems, and that not much could be done by the teacher until the problems were addressed.         Based on her experience in testing and teaching poor readers, Professor Roswell took a more positive tack. She concluded that a child's reading deficiencies required special attention regardless of emotional problems. Her views and those of like-minded teachers eventually prevailed. Their stand brought about recognition of distinct disabilities like various kinds of dyslexia.         For teaching reading, she advocated using phonics along with the whole language method, or a system that chiefly exposes students to the sight of words. The dual approach meant that readers could be able to decode sounds and words.         Her first text, ''Reading Disability: A Human Approach,'' was published in the 1960's and had four printings. Most recently she was a co-author of ''Teaching Children to Read, a Step-by-Step Guide for Volunteer Tutors'' (Continental Press, 1998); and ''Creating Successful Readers'' (Riverside, 1994).         Professor Roswell is survived by a son, Dr. Arthur, of Bridgewater, N.J.; a daughter, Elaine Roswell of New Haven; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. Her husband, David S. Roswell, an economist, died in the 1960's.       
         Zena Sutherland, the most prominent reviewer of American children's books for nearly three decades and the author of five editions of ''Children and Books,'' the classic textbook on the subject, died on June 12 in Chicago. She was 86.         As the editor and reviewer of The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, essentially a one-woman operation, she concisely assessed about 30,000 titles, more than 100 a month, from 1958 to 1985. The Bulletin is directed to librarians, but her words were also taken seriously by editors, publishers, writers and illustrators.         ''No other individual's views had such an impact on children's books then or now,'' said Roger Sutton, the editor of The Horn Book magazine and one of her many protégés.         Mrs. Sutherland led the way in the critical rather than sugary descriptive reviewing that accompanied the flourishing of American children's books. She explained the great change in the field of children's books that paralleled her career as the lifting of taboos, most of which reflected a sincere wish to protect children. She accepted children as real and aware individuals and their books as real literature, and she was a stalwart supporter of books that addressed a range of problems and issues that some still find shocking.         In 1963 the psychologically incisive picture book ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' by Maurice Sendak, was controversial in the way it depicted a child's temper tantrum. Mrs. Sutherland found it ''most imaginative and unusual.'' Her 1970 review of Mr. Sendak's ''In the Night Kitchen'' serenely sailed past little Mickey's brief nudity, which so disturbed other reviewers, and described the book as an ''engaging fantasy.''         Mr. Sendak remembered both her criticism and her friendship as ''a magnifying glass.'' He added, ''You couldn't lie or be sappy or ridiculous.''         Of John Donovan's ''I'll Get There. It Better Be Worth the Trip,'' a 1969 novel for young adults that introduced homosexuality as a theme, she said, ''It is not the crux of the story, and it is handled with dignity.'' Similarly, in 1974 she identified Robert Cormier's first novel, ''The Chocolate War,'' now considered a classic, as ''a sobering, dramatic and timeless story.''         Zena Karras was born in Winthrop, Mass., in 1915 and moved with her mother to Chicago after her parents divorced. She graduated from the University of Chicago in 1937, married Roland Bailey the same year and had three children. In 1956 she began course work at the Graduate Library School with the vague intention of becoming a medical librarian, took a children's literature course on a whim and was soon asked to take over The Bulletin temporarily.         Mrs. Sutherland also reviewed children's books for The Saturday Review from 1966 to 1972 and for The Chicago Tribune from 1972 to 1984. She taught at the Library School from 1972 to 1986 and served on all the important library and children's book committees, including those for the Newbery and Caldecott Awards.         She succeeded May Hill Arbuthnot as the author of ''Children and Books,'' the basic college text on children's literature, in 1972, and revised it regularly, most recently in 1996.         Her friendship with Scott O'Dell, the author of ''Island of the Blue Dolphins'' and other historical novels for children, led to the establishment in 1981 of the $5,000 Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, of which she was the permanent chairwoman.         In 1983 a collection of articles in her honor, ''Celebrating Children's Books,'' generated royalties that were used to establish the Zena Sutherland lecture series, now run by the Chicago Public Library and the University of Chicago Lab School.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1961. In 1964 she married Alec Sutherland, a Scot who was then director of broadcasting at the University of Chicago. He died in 1990.         Her survivors include a daughter, Katherine Linehan, a professor of English at Oberlin College; two sons, Stephen Bailey, associate dean and professor of history at Knox College, and Thomas Bailey, a teacher in Hellenbaek, Denmark; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         ''I love reading and I love reviewing,'' Mrs. Sutherland once said in an interview. ''Opening every single package was like Christmas. I have been known to stop in the middle of unpacking a load of books and sit down with one.''       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died yesterday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems ranging from acne to alcoholism to AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail. The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers. Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancé's father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m.         She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of goodwill to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going.         ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own.         And a 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         And while her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-rights organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research.         ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955.         ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' Mrs. Lederer said in a 1990 interview. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Eppie Lederer, who as the syndicated columnist Ann Landers was widely considered responsible for bringing the advice column into the modern era, died on Saturday at her home in Chicago. She was 83.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bone marrow, her family said.         Mrs. Lederer, who became Ann Landers in 1955, avoided the quavering prose and Victorian euphemism of an earlier generation of newspaper sob sisters in favor of hard-nosed, often witty, discussion of contemporary woes that, as she liked to say, ''would twirl your turban.''         She advised millions of readers on problems as varied as acne, alcoholism and AIDS, often in spirited competition with her identical twin sister, who wrote the advice column Dear Abby.         At the time of Mrs. Lederer's death, her column was carried in more than 1,200 newspapers around the world, with a readership of 90 million, according to Creators Syndicate, her distributor. A 1978 World Almanac survey named her the most influential woman in the United States.         ''I would rather have my column on a thousand refrigerator doors than win a Pulitzer,'' she once said.         A petite, elegant woman who favored high heels and silk, Mrs. Lederer had delicate features and a voice of pure ground glass.         An ardent liberal on most social issues, she was deeply traditional in matters of personal morality.         She never smoked or drank alcohol, and remained, in her words, a ''nice Jewish girl from Sioux City, Iowa,'' whose public expressions of annoyance never got much stronger than ''Oh, banana oil!''         But decades spent advising Nervous in Nevada and Desperate in Denver did not make Mrs. Lederer immune to personal foibles, and she occasionally appeared to need a dose of her own counsel on such matters as public discretion, divorce and her highly visible rivalry with her sister.         Mrs. Lederer was born Esther Pauline Friedman in Sioux City on July 4, 1918, the third of four daughters of Abraham and Rebecca Friedman.         Her twin sister, Pauline Esther, known as Popo, followed 17 minutes afterward, just as she would later follow her into the advice business.         The girls' father was an immigrant from Vladivostok, Russia, who made his start in America selling chickens from a wagon and, in the classic New World success story, wound up owning movie theaters in three states.         ''I owe a lot to my parents and to my Iowa heritage,'' Mrs. Lederer said in an interview with her flagship newspaper, The Chicago Tribune, in 1996. ''I think that middle American values have helped me tremendously -- the principles, the morality.''         Jules's Wife to Ann Landers         In their youth, the vivacious, dark-haired Friedman twins were inseparable. Both entered Morningside College in Sioux City, where Eppie, as she said afterward, ''majored in boys.''         She left in 1939, after three and a half years, to marry Jules W. Lederer, a hat salesman who later formed the Budget Rent-a-Car Corporation. Eppie was wed in a double ceremony alongside Popo.         The new Mrs. Lederer moved to Eau Claire, Wis., where she became active in Democratic politics, winning the county party chairmanship.         In 1955, the Lederers moved to Chicago. By now Mrs. Lederer was an affluent housewife and the mother of a daughter. She was deeply invested in being married, so much so that she had the words ''Jules's Wife'' stitched into the linings of her fur coats.         The Chicago Democratic machine would not have her (''We don't need any more hell raisers,'' she recalled being told), and Mrs. Lederer cast about for something else as an outlet for her boundless energy.         She noticed an advice column in The Chicago Sun-Times called Ask Ann Landers.         ''I thought it was a good column, but not great,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in a 1990 interview. ''When I read it, I would cover up her answers and think about what I would have said if I had been Ann Landers.''         On an impulse, she called a friend who was a Sun-Times executive and asked whether she could help the advice columnist answer some of her mail.         The timing was serendipitous. It turned out that the columnist, a nurse named Ruth Crowley, had died the week before, and the paper was holding a contest among 28 of the women at The Sun-Times to find a new Ann Landers.         Mrs. Lederer, who had never held a paying job or written a word for publication, became the 29th contestant.         She was given a stack of letters and asked to answer them. The first was from a woman who owned a walnut tree that was dropping nuts into her next-door neighbor's yard. A fight had erupted over who owned the fallen nuts.         ''I knew this was a legal question, and I began to wonder how high up in legal circles I could go for the answer to impress the contest judges,'' Mrs. Lederer recalled in 1990.         Deciding to settle only for the best, she called up Justice William O. Douglas of the Supreme Court, a friend from her Democratic Party days. The answer, he said, was that the neighbor could do anything with the nuts but sell them.         For the next letter, from a Roman Catholic who wanted to marry a Protestant, Mrs. Lederer sought the counsel of another old friend, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh, the president of Notre Dame. She answered the rest of the mail in similar fashion, drawing on experts in her powerful social circle.         When Mrs. Lederer brought the letters back to The Sun-Times, as she later recalled, the contest editor was horrified to see so many prominent figures in her answers. ''You can't use these people's names,'' he told her. ''They'll sue us!''         Mrs. Lederer assured him she really knew those people, and they had given their permission.         The editor looked at her. ''How long do you think you can keep this up?'' he asked.         She replied, ''I think I can keep it up for quite a while.''         A few days later Mrs. Lederer's telephone rang. ''Good morning, Ann Landers,'' said The Sun-Times's publisher, Marshall Field IV.         Tackling a 1950's Taboo         Where earlier lovelorn columnists like Dorothy Dix had given measured, modest replies to discreet questions about courtship, the new Ann Landers was a wisecracking tough cookie out of Damon Runyon. She addressed correspondents as ''Buster,''  ''Honey'' and ''Bub,'' admonishing them to ''kwitcherbellyachin' '' over trivial complaints. Husbands distressed by wifely inattention were reassured, ''Many are cold, but few are frozen.'' Once a Miss Icarus wrote saying she wanted to marry her fiancé's father. Mrs. Lederer's reply: ''Drop Daedalus.'' The column was an immediate success, and quickly went into syndication.         In those gentler times, much of the mail was about the miseries of pimples and the mores of going steady. ''A lemon squeezed too many times is considered garbage,'' Mrs. Lederer admonished one 1950's teenager who inquired about petting.         But even then, Mrs. Lederer discussed more controversial issues. During her first year she responded to a letter about homosexuality, taboo advice-column fare in the 1950's. The paper in St. Joseph, Mich., refused to print the column; the publisher told her he planned to run an announcement on Page 1 that the column would not be appearing that day because the subject matter was unfit for a family newspaper.         ''I called the publisher up and said, 'This is a human problem, and that is what I do,' '' she told The New Yorker in a 1995 interview. The publisher held firm.         ''I said: 'Fine. Then everyone in St. Joe is going to buy The Detroit Free Press to see what you won't print.' I called The Free Press and told them to get ready for a lot of extra sales.         ''From then on, boy,'' she added, ''that St. Joe paper printed every damn word I wrote.''         Early in her newfound career, Mrs. Lederer often phoned her twin sister, Pauline Phillips, for help with her replies. Mrs. Phillips, who lived in California, proved so good at coming up with pithy one-liners that within a few months she began writing her own advice column in The San Francisco Chronicle under the name Abigail Van Buren. As Dear Abby battled Ann Landers in syndication, a bitter rivalry between the authors ensued. The sisters reconciled after not speaking for five years.         800 Letters in 2 Hours         When she was not padding around the Sun-Times newsroom in her stocking feet or sifting through the mail in her pink office at the paper, Mrs. Lederer worked at home, a vast apartment boasting commanding views of Lake Michigan and filled with works by Picasso, Dali and Renoir. There, Mrs. Lederer, who left The Sun-Times for the rival Chicago Tribune in 1987, read the several hundred letters winnowed for her each day by her staff, often working until 2 a.m. She was partial to working in the bath, propping the mail on a marble shelf in the tub, tapping out the replies afterward on her I.B.M. Selectric typewriter. She could go through 800 letters, she said, in the course of a two-hour soak.         ''I'm free, the price is right and they can be anonymous,'' she once said of her correspondents. ''They feel they know me.''         Her office, which by the 1990's was receiving 2,000 letters a day, functioned as a de facto clearing house for people in need, maintaining computerized lists of support groups and social service agencies in hundreds of cities.         ''I can't salvage a life that's been rotten for 20 years in a little bit of newspaper space,'' Mrs. Lederer told The New York Times Magazine in 1974. But, she added, ''We know exactly where to send people for every imaginable problem.''         In her role as Ann Landers, Mrs. Lederer was an outspoken advocate for several causes. Although she staunchly opposed United States involvement in Southeast Asia (''I never could do a thing with Lyndon Johnson,'' she once said ruefully), she visited Vietnam in 1967 as a gesture of good will to American troops there.         In 1971, she wrote about a bill awaiting the president's signature that would allocate $100 million for cancer research. She asked readers to clip the column and send it to Washington. Buried under a million columns, President Richard Nixon signed the National Cancer Act.         In 1975, Mrs. Lederer underwent what she would call her ''only troubled time'' when her husband left her for another woman. She made the decision to disclose in her column that Ann Landers, who until the early 1970's continued to advise couples to stay together for the sake of the children, was getting a divorce herself.         She wrote a shorter column than usual, asking newspaper editors to preserve the white space at the bottom as a memorial to ''one of the world's best marriages that didn't make it to the finish line.''         Mr. Lederer died in 1999. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Phillips, Mrs. Lederer is survived by her daughter, Margo Howard, of Cambridge, Mass.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.         Fans and Powerful Enemies         After the column on her divorce, she received more than 35,000 letters of encouragement from readers, had the linings removed from her fur coats, and kept on going. ''A divorce,'' she once said, ''is nothing compared with the problems I see in my everyday mail.''         Although those problems would progress from Saturday-night dating woes to late-20th-century ills like domestic violence and crack, Mrs. Lederer was sometimes astonished to discover the everyday things that could inflame the passions of her readers.         She once threw her column open to a discussion of whether toilet paper should be hung with the free end coming over or under the roll; 15,000 letters later, Mrs. Lederer (herself in the ''under'' camp) had to call a moratorium on further debate.         Occasionally Mrs. Lederer's work was the source of public embarrassment. In 1982, she admitted to having recycled 15-year-old letters for use in a number of current columns. In 1993 she was discovered to have embellished a letter about fraudulent charities by adding condemnatory remarks of her own. A 1995 interview with The New Yorker in which she called Pope John Paul II ''a Polack'' drew widespread criticism.         She apologized for the incidents in print, resolving to do her customary penance, ''40 lashes with a wet noodle.''         While her column made Mrs. Lederer powerful friends, from prominent educators and executives to presidents, it also brought her bitter enemies.         Among her detractors were the National Rifle Association, which opposed her advocacy of gun control; groups opposing abortion, which deplored her abortion-rights position; and animal-protection organizations, angered by her support for the use of animals in medical research. ''Those three groups really despise me, and I'm very proud of it,'' she said in 1993.         All in all, she said, being Ann Landers proved far more involving -- and more gratifying -- than she could ever have anticipated when she brought home her first stack of letters in 1955. ''I cannot imagine a career that could be more rewarding,'' she said in 1990. ''There is enormous satisfaction in knowing that I've been able to touch the lives of millions of people. Where does anybody get a job like this?''         Mrs. Lederer, who owned the rights to the Ann Landers name, often said she did not expect anyone to replace her after her death. There would be no newspaper contest, no tales of disputed walnuts. ''There will never be another Ann Landers,'' she told The New Yorker. ''When I go, the column goes with me.''       
         Elaine Gelman, a leader in the effort to make it legal in New York for specially trained nurses to prescribe drugs and perform other medical functions previously reserved for doctors, died on Tuesday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 75 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, said her son Eric Gelman.         Ms. Gelman, a pediatric nurse practitioner, was president of the New York State Coalition of Nurse Practitioners in 1985 and 1988. It was in 1988 that the State Legislature adopted a measure to allow practitioners -- registered nurses who have an additional two years of training -- to make some medical diagnoses and prescribe treatment in collaboration with a physician.         The measure ended a legislative battle that had gone on for almost a decade and had pitted nurse practitioners' organizations against doctors' and nurses' groups. The New York State Nurses Association, which represents registered and practical nurses, objected at the time because, it contended, the bill limited the practice of other nurses by suggesting that without a nurse practitioner's certificate, nurses are not competent to diagnose and treat illnesses.         The New York State Medical Society, representing doctors, had argued that the bill did not ensure adequate supervision by physicians.         Before the bill's passage, Ms. Gelman and other advocates said that expanding the nurse practitioners' role would improve health care in underserved rural and urban areas.         Ms. Gelman was on the New York State Board for Nursing from 1990 to 1996 and was active in the National Association of Pediatric Nurse Associates/Practitioners. She was executive director of the Coalition of Nurse Practitioners from 1996 to 1998.         Ms. Gelman was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Queens College. She became a registered nurse in 1948 after attending the New York University-Bellevue Hospital School of Nursing. She became a pediatric nurse practitioner in 1975 after attending the Columbia University-Presbyterian Hospital School of Nursing.         Besides her son Eric, of Larchmont, N.Y., she is survived by her husband of 50 years, David Gelman; another son, Andrew, of Manhattan; a daughter, Amy Haugesag of Kansas City, Mo.; two grandchildren; a sister, Florence Roher of White Plains; and her mother, Shirley Rodkinson, also of White Plains.       
         Shirley Aronoff Greitzer, a pianist who was the director of placement at the Juilliard School for nearly a decade and executive director of the Waterloo Music Festival School before that, died on May 29. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was kidney and heart failure, said Jody Schwarz, one of her three daughters.         Mrs. Greitzer was born in Dallas in 1926. She began her musical studies there and made her first professional appearances with the Dallas Symphony as the soloist in concertos by Mozart and Liszt.         When she was 17, she won first prize in a competition sponsored by Mu Phi Epsilon, a music honors organization, and was awarded a scholarship to the Juilliard School. She continued her piano studies there with Rosina Lhevine and became Lhevine's assistant. She also studied chamber music with Felix Salmond and Louis Persinger. In the early 1950's, she made her recital debut at Town Hall.         In the early 1970's, she was the harpsichordist for the Philharmonia Virtuosi of New York. When the Waterloo Festival and its music school opened in Waterloo Village, N.J., in 1976, she joined the faculty as a chamber music instructor. In 1979, she became executive director, a position she held until 1988.         In 1990, Mrs. Greitzer became the director of placement at the Juilliard School, a position that included arranging performances for students. She established noontime concert series around New York for the students, but although the performances were largely intended to give them experience before audiences, Mrs. Greitzer insisted that they be paid.         Mrs. Greitzer was married to Sol Greitzer, who for many years was the principal violist of the New York Philharmonic. He died in 1989.         She is survived by her daughters, Ms. Schwarz, of Seattle; Deborah Greitzer Silberschlag, of Waldorf, Md.; and Pamela Manasse, of Manhattan; a sister, Marjorie Weissman, of Queens; and six grandchildren.       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died Saturday night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Tormé seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike. In the words of the director Mike Nichols, ''She sings like Spencer Tracy acts.''         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and on concert stages, largely with small groups, singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. Rather than acting out the romantic dramas of well-known song lyrics, she projects an understanding that is almost maternal in its blend of wisdom and empathy.''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' which became a huge hit record, and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano'' and ''This Old House,'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear long after she was pursuing a less-flamboyant repertory.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page, never to Rosemary Clooney. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said about her earlier recording career.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded pensive ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.         She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         She was nominated for an Emmy award for an appearance on ''E.R.,'' the series that featured her nephew George Clooney, and this year she was given a lifetime achievement Grammy award a month after she was hospitalized for lung cancer surgery.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness. One of the Clooney children, Andy, drowned as a boy swimming in the Ohio River. But the others survived and remained close. They included Betty, who sang professionally for a while with Rosemary; and Nick, who became a television performer. Another sibling, Gail, did not venture into show business.         When Rosemary was 10 and in the fourth grade, she made her acting debut in a school production of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' in which she played the witch. That same year her paternal grandmother died, sending her father into an intensified period of drinking. Rosemary and her siblings were sent to live with her mother's family, the Guilfoyles. After Rosemary completed the sixth grade her grandmother took her to Ironton, Ohio, east of Maysville. Two years later, they moved to Cincinnati.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them, and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         Grandmother Guilfoyle , who sewed as well as she could cook, made them dresses, and one of their uncles, George Guilfoyle, accompanied them on the band bus to make certain that they were not led astray by any of Mr. Pastor's musicians.         In 1946 Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys speculated was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947 she was gaining notice. Downbeat magazine said she had ''an extraordinarily good voice, perhaps the nearest thing to Ella Fitzgerald we've ever heard.'' In 1948 Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band. Rosemary stayed another year before she left, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording, no matter how many copies it sold.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs for Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television, including the Ed Sullivan show.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' The song was based on something old and Armenian, updated by the novelist William Saroyan and Ross Bagdasarian, who later changed his name to David Seville and created the Chipmunks. From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it, but he insisted, hinting broadly that if she refused, her career at Columbia might come to an end. The recording became a runaway best seller, and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano,'' which also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton,'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She fell in love with Dante DiPaolo, a dancer at Paramount studios, but jilted him to marry Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and to make more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         In the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle that went nowhere (he was married and the father of six children) and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic, and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This for Remembrance.'' ''The records I did then sound like they were made underwater. I misbehaved with everyone, onstage and off.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968 she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles by Sirhan Sirhan. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, she was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         Unexpectedly she ran into Mr. DiPaolo, who moved in with her and became her road manager, and in 1996 she married him in the church in Maysville where she had been baptized.         In the 1990's she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label, and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her husband, Mr. DiPaolo; three sons, the actor Miguel Ferrer; Gabriel Ferrer, a painter and Episcopal priest married to Debby Boone; and the voice-over actor Rafael Ferrer; two daughters, Maria Murdoch, a designer; and Monsita Teresa Botwick; 10 grandchildren, her brother, Nick Clooney, and her sister, Gail Clooney Darley.         When she was in her 60's, Ms. Clooney said, ''If you hang around long enough, you get a lot of good stuff.'' Most of the time, she added, her life was pretty good.       
         Jane Bancroft Cook, an heir to her family company, Dow Jones & Company, and a member of its board for 36 years, died yesterday morning at her home in Cohasset, Mass., the company announced yesterday.         Mrs. Cook was 90 and had been in failing health for a decade, said a daughter, Martha Robes. She was the largest family shareholder at Dow Jones.         She served on the board of Dow Jones from 1949 to 1985 when its flagship newspaper, The Wall Street Journal, grew to wield international influence and the company evolved from a small private enterprise to become a publicly traded, $4 billion media empire.         Mrs. Cook was an active philanthropist, though she preferred to give anonymously, her daughter said.         Roy A. Hammer, a senior partner at the Boston law firm of Hemenway & Barnes and the trustee of many of the family trusts, said yesterday that Mrs. Cook had been intensely interested in the company, particularly its flagship newspaper. She held more shares than any other individual family member, Mr. Hammer said.         ''She was vitally interested in the company and its success and its maintaining its journalistic independence and standard of accuracy in its news reporting,'' he said. ''She was a very dedicated director for a great many years and instilled, particularly in her three daughters, a sense of responsibility for the stewardship of The Wall Street Journal.''         Mrs. Cook was the last of three children of Jane W. W. Bancroft, the stepdaughter of Clarence W. Barron, who bought Dow Jones from its founders in 1902. At his death, Mr. Barron left the company to his stepdaughter. One descendant of each of Jane W. W. Bancroft's children -- Hugh Bancroft Jr. and Jessie Bancroft Cox, who both died years ago, and Mrs. Cook -- now serve on the board.         In a statement released yesterday, Peter R. Kann, the chairman and chief executive of Dow Jones, said that Mrs. Cook ''was firm on principles, kind to people and ever modest about herself.''         ''Her abiding commitment to editorial integrity and corporate independence,'' Mr. Kann added, ''will continue to guide the company, its management and its owners.''         The company announcement was made minutes after the stock market closed. It stressed that her death ''will not result in any change in voting control of Dow Jones.''         Mr. Hammer said yesterday that the Bancroft heirs controlled about 70 percent of Dow Jones, with most of the shares held in a series of interlocking trusts.         Mrs. Cook gave large sums to institutions throughout New England, from Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University to animal shelters, her daughter said. She also helped create New College in Sarasota, Fla., where she had a second home, a residence that she bequeathed to the college, Mr. Hammer said.         In addition to Mrs. Robes, of Round Pond, Me., Mrs. Cook is survived by two other daughters, Jean Stevenson, of Lyme, N.H., and Boca Grande, Fla., and Elizabeth Steele, of Burlington, Vt.; six stepchildren; eight grandchildren; 11 stepgrandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Annie Snyder, a leader of efforts to prevent the development of land near the site of the Civil War battles of Bull Run in northern Virginia, died on July 19 in Manassas, Va. She was 80. She and her husband had a farm near the battlefield.         The cause was pneumonia, The Associated Press reported.         By 1988 Mrs. Snyder had been involved, by her count, in six efforts in 30 years to prevent developers from encroaching on what she called the ''hallowed ground'' of the battlefield. She said then that she had lost only one confrontation, when a power company strung lines near the field.         In an interview in The New York Times in 1988, she said, ''When we first moved here it was easy to imagine at night that you heard the creaking of leather saddles as General Longstreet's advanced guards arrived to help Stonewall Jackson as he held on to that railroad embankment over there.''         At the time, she was leading conservationists and Civil War enthusiasts in opposing developers who wanted to build a giant shopping mall next to the battlefield. She also generated backing for her side of the issue in Congress, where legislation was passed to buy and protect the land where the mall was to have been built. The confrontation over the plan for a shopping mall has been called the Third Battle of Bull Run.         Earlier, she had prevailed against federal officials who wanted to rearrange roads near the battlefield. Other victories included helping to thwart plans to build a Great America theme park near the historic site.         In the 1950's she championed civil rights in Virginia and was active in the Republican Party.         Born in Pittsburgh, Anne Delp Snyder attended the University of Pittsburgh's law school. In World War II she was one of the first female officers in the Marine Corps, serving in the United States as a recruiter and a quartermaster.         Her survivors include her husband, Waldon Peter Snyder, known as Pete, a former Marine Corps aviator; six children; six grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.       
         Lorna J. Marshall, a college English instructor turned homemaker who in her 50's began a new life as an anthropologist studying the Bushmen of Africa, died on July 8 at her home in Peterborough, N.H. She was 103.         She had lived with her daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, since 1996, Ms. Thomas said. She previously lived in the same house in Cambridge, Mass., since the late 1920's.         Mrs. Marshall's anthropological career began when her husband, Laurence K. Marshall, a founder and president of the Raytheon Corporation, retired in 1950 with the thought that it was time to get reacquainted with his family.         ''Where is the remotest place we can go and be a family again?'' Mr. Marshall asked, said Irven DeVore, the More research professor of anthropology at Harvard.         The Kalahari Desert was the answer he found. He decided he would take his family to live among the legendary Bushmen.         ''They became a sort of Swiss Family Robinson of the Kalahari,'' Dr. DeVore said.         The family's accomplishments made it more than that. Mr. Marshall helped the Bushmen start a fine-wool industry. The Marshalls' son, John, began his career as a leading maker of ethnographic documentary films. Ms. Thomas, who would go on to write best sellers like ''The Hidden Life of Dogs,'' wrote a well-received book on the Bushmen, ''The Harmless People'' (Knopf, 1958).         Meanwhile, Mrs. Marshall began the painstaking process of documenting the culture and behavior of the Bushmen, sometimes called !Kung. (The ''!'' represents a clicking sound in their language). She was the first of dozens of scholars who have made the Bushmen one of the world's most studied populations of traditional hunter-gatherers.         ''To say she started it is not a mistake,'' Dr. DeVore said. ''By standards of ethnography, she did as well or better than any monograph I know, and she was there early.''         Over the next two decades, the Marshall family made eight trips to the Kalahari, a desert the size of Spain in what is now Namibia, Botswana and the Republic of South Africa, staying for as long as a year and a half at a time. Then the family would return to Cambridge, where Mrs. Marshall would employ the best graduate students to organize her voluminous notes, which resulted in two books and many articles.         An honor she particularly valued was having a !Kung baby girl named after her. The child was called Norna, because the Bushmen, for all their ability to make unusual vocal sounds, cannot pronounce the letter L.         Lorna Jean McLean was born in Morenci, a mining town in the Arizona Territory, on Sept. 14, 1898. Her father, Gordon McLean, a mining engineer, died when she was 7. Her mother, the former Bessie Holmes, remarried and moved with her daughter to Riverside, Calif., and then Los Angeles.         Miss McLean graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in English. She then gave up the beginning of a career in ballet to travel around the world with her mother, who had been widowed again. They traveled throughout the Middle East and Asia. In China, they met an instructor at Mount Holyoke College who offered Miss McLean a job teaching English.         She accepted, but soon met Mr. Marshall in Nova Scotia, where both had relatives. They married and moved to Cambridge.         At the Cambridge Community Center, she organized women to salvage tungsten wire from radio tubes that Raytheon could re-use in making electronic devices. The salvage operation employed black and white women, unusual at the time, and permitted women to work flexible hours, which was also unusual.         Mr. Marshall said he wanted to do something with his family when he retired, and its members were interested in anthropology. So he asked his wife to take some courses at Harvard, which she did from time to time among trips to Africa.         The family was at first apprehensive about tales of poison darts and trance dances, but found the Bushmen polite and kind. The Marshall family lived in tents, even as temperatures ranged from freezing to 125 degrees.         Mrs. Marshall published her first book, ''!Kung of Nyae Nyae,'' in 1975 (Harvard University Press), and her second, ''Nyae Nyae !Kung Belief and Rites,'' three years ago (Peabody Museum Press).         She is survived by her daughter, her son, who lives in Belmont, Mass., three grandchildren and three great-granddaughters.         She is remembered by others. A year or so after her 100th birthday party, the child of a Bushman she had known as a child came to visit her.       
         Dr. Alice M. Stewart, an epidemiologist who first demonstrated the link between X-rays of pregnant women and disease in their children, a finding that changed medical practice, died on June 23 in Oxford, England. A resident of the countryside outside Oxford, she was 95.         Dr. Stewart, who became one of the most authoritative critics of the safety of the American nuclear weapons program and a leading proponent of the idea that no level of exposure to radiation is safe, came to prominence in 1956 for her report on prenatal X-rays.         It was an increasingly common practice in the 1950's to X-ray the abdomens of pregnant women to determine the position of their babies, said Dr. Gayle Greene of Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., who wrote ''The Woman Who Knew Too Much: Alice Stewart and the Secrets of Radiation.''         Dr. Stewart, then a member of the social medicine department at Oxford, was surprised to discover when she conducted a survey that children of mothers who had had this X-ray were almost twice as likely to have cancer as other children.         Her finding that there was danger in receiving even such a low dose of radiation was met with outrage by doctors and the nuclear industry, and Dr. Stewart had difficulties obtaining financing for other studies. But by the mid-1970's, other scientists had duplicated her findings on prenatal X-rays, and the practice ended.         In a 1995 interview with The Times Higher Education Supplement, a weekly publication in Britain, she described her problems with financing of studies. ''If I had been a man I would never have stood it; I would have gone,'' she said. ''The prospects were too bad, the pay too low. But being a woman I didn't have all that number of choices.''         Dr. Stewart was also at the center of a 14-year battle with the Department of Energy, which cut off her access to its records on the health of nuclear-weapons workers after she and her colleagues found that low doses of radiation had increased the number of cancers among workers at the Hanford nuclear weapons plant in Washington State.         Congressional pressure, fueled by Dr. Stewart's appearances before a House subcommittee, forced the department to open the records to independent researchers in 1990 and to surrender its monopoly on government financing of radiation research.         More recently, Dr. Stewart devoted her time to arguing that data on Hiroshima survivors, the main source for standards on the safe levels of radiation exposure, was deeply flawed and underestimated radiation's harmful effects.         She was born Alice Mary Naish in Sheffield, England. Her mother, Lucy Wellburn Naish, was one of the first British women to become a doctor, and four of the Naish children became doctors as well.         After earning a medical degree at Cambridge, Dr. Stewart joined Oxford in 1941 and studied workers who filled shells with TNT at munition plants. Her conclusions that exposure to TNT impaired the body's ability to form blood led Britain to change its manufacturing techniques.         Dr. Stewart left Oxford in 1974, and became a research fellow at the University of Birmingham in England, where she worked until about two years ago.         Her marriage to Ludovick Stewart ended in divorce. She is survived by her daughter, Anne Marshall of London, who is a doctor, and four grandchildren.       
         Mary Knowles Fritchey, whose fund-raising and support for the Kennedy Center, the Phillips Collection and other cultural institutions helped make Washington a center for the arts, died on July 9 at her home in Washington. She was 90.         In 1965, Ms. Fritchey became one of the first fund-raisers for the Kennedy Center, which now presents more than 3,300 arts performances a year. She was a trustee at the Phillips Collection, a modern art museum in Washington. She helped guide its transition from a small family museum to a larger public one with a professional staff.         She was on the board of the Shakespeare Theater in Washington and raised money for the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, which is part of the Smithsonian Institution.         Her first husband, Frank Gardiner Wisner, a former deputy director at the Central Intelligence Agency, died in 1965. In 1975, she married Clayton Willis Fritchey, a newspaper columnist, who died last year.         Ms. Fritchey is survived by three sons, Graham Wisner of Great Falls, Va., Ellis Wisner of Washington, Frank Wisner of New York City, a former ambassador to Zambia, Egypt, India and the Philippines; a daughter, Elizabeth Wisner Hazard of Belgrade, Me.; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Ghity Lindenbaum Stern, whose philanthropy benefited educational institutions in the United States and Israel, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         Mrs. Stern had been honorary chairman of the board of directors of Yeshiva University's Stern College for Women. It was founded with a donation from her husband, Max Stern, whom she married in 1950.         Mr. Stern was founder and chairman of the board of the Hartz Mountain Products Corporation, a philanthropist and a fund-raiser for Jewish education. He was president of the Jewish Center, a synagogue in Manhattan, for 45 years until he died in 1982.         Mrs. Stern was one of the founders of the Manhattan Day School. She was also a supporter of Shaare Zedek Medical Center in Jerusalem.         Ghity Amiel was born in Lithuania and married Nathan Lindenbaum in 1928. She fled Hitler's forces and traveled to New York City with Mr. Lindenbaum and four children in 1940 from Antwerp, where her father, Moshe Avigdor Amiel, was chief rabbi before he became chief rabbi of Tel Aviv. She lived in New York City the rest of her life.         Mr. Lindenbaum died in 1946. Two of her sons, Henry Lindenbaum and Stanley Stern, also died before her.         She is survived by five children, all residents of the New York area: two daughters, Maidy Jeger and Gloria Kisch; three sons, Armand and Marcel Lindenbaum and Leonard Stern; 24 grandchildren and 37 great-grandchildren; and two sisters, Esther Mann of Tel Aviv and Sully Selbourn of Manchester, England.       
         Edith Merrill Bancroft, a patron of the arts and the widow of Harding F. Bancroft, a vice chairman of The New York Times Company, died last Monday at her home in Washington. She was 90.         Edith Hall was born in Atlanta on April 17, 1912. She was the daughter of William Claiborne Hall, an executive of the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, and the former Christine Collins. She grew up in Cincinnati and Louisville.         She graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and married Frederick T. Merrill, a Foreign Service officer in 1935. She volunteered as a nurse's aide at a Washington hospital during World War II. Mr. Merrill died in 1974.         In 1987, she married Mr. Bancroft, a former diplomat and lawyer who, as vice chairman of The Times Company, helped shape the decision to publish the Pentagon Papers in 1971. He retired in 1975 and died in 1992.         She is survived by her son, Frederick T. Merrill Jr. of Washington; her daughters, Linda Merrill Ciccone of Florence, Italy, and Dr. Marianna Merrill Russell of Sparks, Md.; her sister, Noel Train of Washington; 11 grandchildren; and 5 great-grandchildren.       
         Dolores Olmedo Patiño, the combative Mexican art collector who turned her hacienda into a museum devoted to paintings by Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, died in Mexico City on Saturday. Her age was a matter of debate, but she used a birth date that would make her 88.         Mrs. Olmedo amassed 137 works by Rivera and 25 by his wife, Kahlo, and for decades controlled the estates of these Mexican artists. Although Mrs. Olmedo eventually opened her collection to the public, she was denounced by her critics for delays in inaugurating the museum and for her reluctance for many years to give art experts and biographers ready access to the works and archives of Rivera and Kahlo.         But the diminutive Mrs. Olmedo, who once modeled for Diego Rivera, welcomed controversy as an opportunity to move from the margins of Mexican cultural history to center stage. Her stubbornness was vindicated when her Museo Dolores Olmedo Patiño, on the southern outskirts of Mexico City, was judged an artistic success.         Mrs. Olmedo loved flaunting her independence. Once asked how she would like to be remembered, she replied: ''Just as I am -- a woman who did whatever she felt like doing, and luckily succeeded at it.''         Born in Mexico City on Dec. 14, 1913, Dolores Olmedo was 17 when an encounter cast her destiny. She accompanied her mother, a schoolteacher, to the Ministry of Education, where they had a chance exchange in an elevator with Rivera, then a renowned artist in his 40's working on murals in the building.         ''He asked my mother if he could make some drawings of me,'' Mrs. Olmedo recalled. ''She agreed without knowing that I would pose nude.''         Rivera made 27 drawings of the young woman and gave them to her. Years later, her husband, Howard S. Phillips, an American publisher in Mexico, discovered them and ordered her to return them to Rivera. When Rivera was dying in the mid-1950's, Mrs. Olmedo, by then divorced and wealthy, put him up in her home and helped care for him. A grateful Rivera, whose reputation and earnings had tumbled, again gave her the nude drawings. He also sold her scores of his paintings and many works by Kahlo, who had died in 1954. Before his own death in 1957, Rivera designated Mrs. Olmedo to administer his and Kahlo's estates.         As the artists' reputations -- and the prices for their work -- rebounded, art critics and intellectuals began to resent Mrs. Olmedo's huge hoard of Riveras and Kahlos and her power over the artists' legacies. She was accused of having grossly underpaid for her collection. Stories swirled that a jealous Mrs. Olmedo was intent on sabotaging Kahlo's legacy.         ''I was never a friend of Frida Kahlo,'' Mrs. Olmedo conceded in an interview with The New York Times, in which she referred to the artist's bisexuality. ''Frida Kahlo liked women. I liked men.''         She said that she bought her 25 Kahlo paintings -- for which she paid only $1,600 -- because Rivera begged her to do so to make sure that an important part of his wife's work remained in Mexico under one roof. ''Otherwise I would not have done it,'' Mrs. Olmedo said.         Fewer than 200 Kahlo paintings survive, and Mrs. Olmedo's collection is the most significant private holding of her works.         Critics agreed that she owned some of the most highly regarded Kahlo paintings. Mrs. Olmedo ''has Kahlo's gritty, ferocious paintings -- the kind no one else could have painted,'' said Hayden Herrera, the author of ''Frida,'' a 1983 biography.         Mrs. Olmedo had little regard for Kahlo as an artist, and in several interviews referred to her works as ''trashy.'' Her estimation of Rivera, on the other hand, was uncritical. ''I will always defend his work energetically, while I'm alive and even after I die,'' she wrote in her museum's catalog.         Mrs. Olmedo's collection included dozens of little-known early works by Rivera done in post-Impressionist and Cubist styles. She also owned highly acclaimed paintings from Rivera's later period, including ''La Tehuana'' (1955), a portrait of Mrs. Olmedo wearing the colorful dress of a native of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec; Kahlo often wore such a costume. But she also had many of his least memorable works, like saccharine portraits of Russian children that look like Soviet propaganda.         Mrs. Olmedo became the major collector of Riveras as well as Rivera's benefactor late in his life, thanks to her entrepreneurial acumen. After divorcing in the 1940's, she became one of the first Mexican women to succeed in real estate development. The business brought her into contact with leading industrialists and politicians, and fueled rumors, vigorously denied by Mrs. Olmedo, linking her romantically to several Mexican presidents.         Mrs. Olmedo was married and divorced three times. She is survived by four children from her first marriage, to Mr. Phillips. She also had 14 grandchildren.         In the early 1990's Mrs. Olmedo was accused of deliberately shutting down the Frida Kahlo Museum, also in Mexico City, for two years, under the guise of doing renovations in the building, once Kahlo's home. Mrs. Olmedo declined to explain the long museum closing. Friends suggested that the government was at fault for failing to cover the rather modest renovation costs as it was supposed to, but that Mrs. Olmedo refused to make any public statements that might hurt her political relationships or cast her as too stingy to foot the bill.         Similar reasons seem to have postponed the opening of Mrs. Olmedo's own museum for more than five years. In the mid-1980's she announced that with Mexican government backing she would convert her 16th-century Spanish colonial hacienda in Xochimilco, at the southern end of Mexico City, into a museum and then donate her collection for permanent display there.         During the renovations, the architects discovered that half the building was slowly sinking into its watery foundations and that the roof and walls were leaking.         Eventually, the government paid the renovation costs, and in late 1994 the museum opened. Even then many critics lambasted Mrs. Olmedo for displaying her collection according to her quirky tastes.         ''I lived with this art for most of my life,'' Mrs. Olmedo said. ''Who knows better than me how it should be displayed?''       
         Josephine Laimbeer Schiff, who was active in a number of charitable organizations, died on Wednesday at North Shore University Hospital in Glen Cove, N.Y. She was 89.         For more than three decades, Mrs. Schiff, who was known as Fifi, was a volunteer at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. In the 1970's, she was president of the Society of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         She was also on the board of the Long Island Alzheimer's Foundation, did volunteer work on its behalf and assisted the Wildlife Conservation Society.         Josephine Louise Laimbeer was born in Manhattan and attended the Spence School and the Formatta School in Aiken, S.C. She became an actress and appeared in the 1929 Broadway production of a Cole Porter musical, ''Fifty Million Frenchmen.''         But she gave up her acting career in 1931, when she married John Randolph Fell. He was a partner in Lehman Brothers when he died in 1961.         In 1976, she married John M. Schiff, a partner in Kuhn Loeb & Company. He died in 1987.         She is survived by a daughter, Natalie Fell Spencer; two stepsons, David T. Schiff and Peter G. Schiff; 13 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Emily Genauer, an art critic who championed 20th-century painting and sculpture over the course of a four-decade newspaper career and won a Pulitzer Prize for criticism, died on Friday after a long illness. She was 91.         Starting out as the critic for The New York World in the 1930's, Ms. Genauer made it her mission to introduce modern artists like Marc Chagall and Diego Rivera to a newspaper audience. She also staunchly defended art's independence from politics. In 1949, she left The New York World-Telegram after an argument with its owner, Roy W. Howard, who thought she was paying too much attention to artists he considered ''Communists and left-wingers,'' like Pablo Picasso.         Ms. Genauer's columns for The New York Herald Tribune, where she was chief art critic from 1949 to 1966, were also watched closely by artists. In 1992 she recalled how the painter Clyfford Still, about whom she had written unfavorably, sent her a pair of rubber baby pants with a card. The card read: ''Hoping this will aid in concealing your Sunday affliction. With the compliments of Clyfford Still.''         She tried to promote lesser-known artists. While visiting the East Side town house of John Hay Whitney, the owner of The Herald Tribune, she urged him to purchase more 20th-century art. She took him to a communal studio-gallery of avant-garde artists on the Bowery, directly opposite that neighborhood's leading flophouse. After getting out of his limousine and hesitantly stepping around some drunks, he bought a number of paintings.         The author of numerous books, Ms. Genauer was also a member of the National Council on the Humanities from 1966 to 1970.         Emily Genauer was born July 19, 1911, in Staten Island, where her father owned several delicatessens and was an amateur sculptor. She attended Hunter College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and began writing for The New York World in 1929. She always retained her maiden name as a byline, though after marrying Frederick Gash she took his last name in her private life.         The World paid her by the word, allowing her to make as much as $92 per week, she recalled in 1992. Then she got a call from an editor who told her she was to be paid a salary. ''Aren't you happy?'' the editor asked. ''You're now on staff. Your fee will be $35 a week.''         After The World went out of business and was merged with The New York Telegram, she continued to write for the paper until 1949. That year, United States Representative George A. Dondero issued a warning about Communist sympathies seeping into American life, and mentioned art criticism as a danger zone, citing Ms. Genauer by name, she recalled in a 1992 speech.         ''My brother telephoned me afterwards and said, 'When did you go Communist?' '' she said.         Mr. Howard, her editor, told her she could no longer write about Picasso. She promptly announced her resignation, and then used Mr. Howard's phone to call the editor of The Herald Tribune, who promptly offered her the job as art critic.         In 1966, The Herald Tribune merged with two other newspapers to become The New York World Journal Tribune, and she became its art critic until its demise in 1967. She then wrote a weekly column for the Newsday Syndicate until the mid-1970's. In 1974 she won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished art criticism.         Ms. Genauer is survived by a sister, Blanche Wahl of Baltimore; a daughter, Constance Gash Roche, of New York City; and two grandchildren.         ''I could do it for 60 years because I'd rather look at art than anything else,'' Ms. Genauer said of art criticism in 1992, ''because I love the art world and because every day was different than every other.''

         Helen Matthew Robinson, the matriarch of the family that in 1864 bought the Hawaiian island of Niihau and then so zealously guarded its privacy that it is the only one of the islands where Hawaiian is still spoken as an everyday language, died on July 31 at her home in Makaweli, on the island of Kauai. She was 91.         Though Mrs. Robinson herded cattle at 65, climbed trees at 75 and drove until she was 85, her health had gradually deteriorated in recent years, her son Keith said. She finally had to relinquish decision making concerning the island, which she had assumed in 1969 with the death of her husband, Lester.         Keith Robinson said his mother's influence lived on in the indigenous people who still speak Hawaiian and in the population of rare monk seals on the coastline. Both are results of so severely restricting access to Niihau that it is known as ''the forbidden isle.''         Niihau (pronounced nee-ee-HOW), the seventh-largest Hawaiian island, is 69.5 square miles and is 17 miles southwest of Kauai. Geologically the oldest of the Hawaiian islands, it is considered the home of the volcano goddess Pele, according to legend. Niihau was the only Hawaiian island to vote against statehood in 1959.         The 200 or so residents collect delicate shells to make leis that sell for thousands of dollars. The islanders also work on the Robinsons' sheep and cattle ranch in return for salaries, free housing, food and education for their children. Their daily life seems a throwback to the misty Hawaiian past. There is no electricity or indoor plumbing -- rain is collected in buckets. There are no paved roads, and conversations are conducted in the lilting native language, though Mr. Robinson said that more English words were creeping in.         Guns and alcohol are forbidden, and the Robinsons will not bring tobacco on the weekly supply barge. The residents can be evicted at any time and have no contractual rights.         Mrs. Robinson herself tended to minimize the uniqueness of Niihau, even as she fought to preserve it.         ''It's just a little cattle ranch we operate in our own way,'' she said in a New York Times interview in 1970. ''There's nothing sensational about it. I don't see why everyone is so interested in it.''         The story of the Robinsons and the island begins in Edinburgh with Eliza Hutchinson, the widow of a Scottish sea captain, Francis Sinclair. With some of her children and their spouses, Mrs. Sinclair eventually went to the Sandwich Islands, as Hawaii was then known.         There she met the ruler of Hawaii, King Kamehameha IV, who offered her several parcels of land, including one that stretched from what became downtown Honolulu to Diamond Head in Waikiki. She turned it down in order to buy an entire island, paying $10,000 in gold in 1864.         As he signed the contract, the king said: ''Niihau is yours. But the day may come when Hawaiians are not as strong in Hawaii as they are now. When that day comes, please do what you can to help them.''         The family, who were strict Calvinists, required all residents of the island to attend Congregational church services on Sunday. (It was an easy sell: missionaries had converted them to Christianity 40 years before.) At first, visitors were permitted, though scarce water supplies began to limit invitations.         From the beginning, Mrs. Sinclair and her heirs sought to protect the indigenous culture. They also remained close to the royal family and opposed the American overthrow in 1893, after which the provisional government forbade use of the Hawaiian language.         Keith Robinson said the family totally cut off visits to Niihau in the 1930's because of the vulnerability of people to diseases to which they had never been exposed like measles, which had killed 11 children on the island.         Lester Robinson, Mrs. Robinson's husband, was the great-grandson of Eliza Hutchinson. He grew up in the family compound in the Makaweli District of Kauai, where Mrs. Sinclair had bought more property.         Helen Marion Matthew was born on Aug. 2, 1910, in Washington, D.C., which her family was visiting. She grew up in Berkeley, Calif., and graduated from the University of California.         Her aunt, a tutor to Lester Robinson when he was a boy, arranged a visit to the Robinsons in 1935, and a reluctant Lester was asked in advance to look after Helen. Rather than the dreaded child in pigtails he expected to meet, she turned out to be an attractive, friendly woman in her mid-20's. Keith Robinson said he had always heard it was love at first sight, though the two were not married until 1937.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Robinson rejected numerous offers for the island, including a large one from Japanese interests. The only intrusions she permitted were tourist helicopter flights overhead and secret military activities, which were kept away from both endangered wildlife and residents.         Keith Robinson said he and his brother, Bruce, had no intention of changing anything on the island, much less selling it. Mrs. Robinson is also survived by seven grandchildren.         In 1983, she wrote a letter to a researcher in which she chose one word to describe her vision of Niihau: ''seclusivity.'' It is not in the dictionary, but her meaning was apparent.       
         Marjorie Goldwasser Wyler, for many years the producer of ''Eternal Light,'' a weekly radio program on Jewish themes, died July 22 in Norwalk, Conn. She was 86 and lived in Westport, Conn., and Manhattan.         Working with the late Milton Krents and later with others, Ms. Wyler produced the program, which was broadcast on NBC radio from 1940 to 1985, in her role as director of public relations, radio and television at the Jewish Theological Seminary in Manhattan, where she worked for more than 50 years.         She was also spokeswoman for the seminary and in 1987 came up with the idea, later adopted by New York City, to name 122nd Street, which divides the Jewish Theological Seminary and Union Theological Seminary, Seminary Row.         Ms. Wyler is survived by her daughters, Ruth W. Messinger, the former Manhattan borough president, and Dr. Barbara W. Gold of Philadelphia; a brother, Edwin L. Goldwasser; a sister, Joan Schine; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Nancy Chaffee Whitaker, a leading tennis player in the 1950's who won three consecutive national indoor championships, died Sunday in Coronado, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Indian Wells, Calif.         The cause was complications of cancer, said her husband, the sportscaster Jack Whitaker.         In the early 50's, Nancy Chaffee vied for tennis supremacy with figures like Maureen Connolly, Althea Gibson, Margaret Osborne duPont, Doris Hart, Louise Brough and Shirley Fry.         She was the national indoor titleholder from 1950 to 1952, defeating Gibson, Beverly Baker and Patricia Todd in the finals, long before the open era and the advent of huge prize money. The indoor tournaments were played on the boards at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue in Manhattan before perhaps 2,000 fans at the final rounds.         ''What did I win?'' Chaffee Whitaker said in a 1993 interview. ''A little silver ball and a silver ashtray with a glass base, and I don't even smoke. No money.''         Comparing the modern game with her era, she said: ''There are more better players. When I was playing I was an automatic almost into the semifinals of any tournament. That's just the way it was, a gap between the few top players and the rest. And there was no qualifying for tournaments.''         The daughter of a tennis instructor and a native of Ventura, Calif., she played on the men's tennis team at the University of Southern California because there was no women's squad. While a sophomore, she captured the 1947 United States girls' lawn tennis singles championship and teamed with Baker to win the doubles title.         She emerged in the national spotlight in 1950, reaching the singles quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the singles semifinals of the United States nationals -- the forerunner of the United States Open -- in addition to winning the first of her indoor championships.         In 1951, she teamed with Todd in doubles at the nationals, losing in the final to Fry and Hart, and she played doubles on the 1951 Wightman Cup team that defeated Britain, 6-1.         She was married in October 1951 to Ralph Kiner, the Pittsburgh Pirates' slugger and future Hall of Famer, and retired from most tournament play after winning the 1952 indoor title, devoting herself to rearing a family.         She was later a sports commentator for ABC, developed tennis programs at resorts and helped found the Cartier tennis tournament in Long Island's Hamptons to benefit the American Cancer Society.         In addition to Whitaker, whom she married in 1991, she is survived by three children from her marriage to Kiner, the longtime Mets broadcaster; sons Michael and Scott Kiner, and a daughter, Kathryn Freeman, all of Palm Desert, Calif.; and five grandchildren.       
         Lucia Pamela, a one-of-a-kind entertainer best known for recording a music album in 1969 about her fictional travels to the moon, died on July 25 in a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 98.         Until 1992, Ms. Pamela's only album, ''Into Outer Space With Lucia Pamela,'' was all but forgotten. Irwin Chusid, a radio disc jockey, helped revive her career and produced a reissue of her album. When a small independent label, Arf Arf, reissued it on CD that year, record collectors around the world took note. Not only were the homemade lyrics and songs unusual and full of infectious childlike optimism and sincerity (she truly believed she had gone to the moon), but her background was equally compelling.         Ms. Pamela's story is a mixture of fact and self-invention. She claimed, for example, to be the first person ever on television and radio; that Ignace Paderewski told her mother she would be the finest pianist in the world; that she was kicked out of a German music conservatory for being overqualified. Relatives said there were grains of truth in all these stories.         Ms. Pamela was born in St. Louis, and her mother was a concert pianist and composer. In 1926, Ms. Pamela won the title of Miss St. Louis. After performing in St. Louis theaters, she moved to Fresno, Calif., where she managed the Fresno Storyland amusement park (she also played Mother Goose there). She was also the host of two radio shows for young women, ''The Encouragement Hour'' and ''Gal About Town.''         Ms. Pamela formed what some say was the country's first all-female orchestra, Lucia Pamela and the Musical Pirates, in which she claimed to have played 15 instruments. With her daughter, Georgia, she formed the vocal duo the Pamela Sisters. Nowadays her daughter, Georgia Frontiere, is best known as the owner of the St. Louis Rams. Ms. Pamela married several times, the last time to Billy Angelo, a professional prizefighter, who died in 1987.         Ms. Pamela is also survived by a son, Ken Irwin of Palm Springs, Calif.; 12 grandchildren; and 27 great-grandchildren.         A documentary on her life is being completed by Danielle Lemaire, a Belgian artist.         One of Ms. Pamela's proudest accomplishments, she liked to say, was building a rocket, touring the Milky Way and stopping on the moon to record her album. With the feel of a warped bebop children's album, it features Ms. Pamela on all instruments -- piano, accordion, drums, clarinet, and probably various household appliances -- accompanying herself as she tells, with gee-whiz glee, tales of amiable lunar roosters, trips to Mars and blue winds. At 65, she sang of a world where anything was possible and everything was shot through with an innocent joy, excitement and imagination.         The album was released in 1969 on a small label, Gulfstream, and signed copies are said to fetch as much as $1,000. She also created a coloring book that tells the story of a moon trip in which she met cows, Indians and anthropomorphic cashews. ''Some of the people there spoke Almond,'' she wrote.         A tireless entertainer, Ms. Pamela was cited by ''Ripley's Believe It or Not'' for having memorized some 10,000 songs. The English band Stereolab even wrote a song about her, ''International Colouring Contest.'' She performed at Las Vegas hotels into her 80's.         ''It was recorded on Moontown,'' Ms. Pamela said of her album. ''I was the only one from Earth there.''       
         Marjorie Slaiman, the longtime costume designer for the Arena Stage theater company in Washington, died on Sept. 13 at a hospital in Fairfax, Va. She was 77 and lived in Washington.         The cause was complications from heart surgery, her family said.         In her 26-year career with Arena Stage Ms. Slaiman designed thousands of costumes for more than 130 productions, including the 1967 premiere of ''The Great White Hope'' with James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander, which alone required more than 230 costumes.         She also worked on Arena Stage's productions of ''Our Town'' and ''Inherit the Wind,'' which both toured the Soviet Union in 1973.         Her credits on Broadway include Arthur Kopit's ''Indians,'' Studs Terkel's ''Working'' and Elie Wiesel's ''Zalmen, or the Madness of God.'' Ms. Slaiman won the first Helen Hayes Award for her costume design for ''Man and Superman'' in 1985 and was nominated for seven more Hayes awards before her retirement in 1993.         Born Marjorie Lawler in the Bronx, she graduated from the New York School of Industrial Art and got her start designing lingerie in New York and costumes for the Shakespeare Theater Festival in Washington during the 1960's.         She is survived by four children, Gary, of McLean, Va.; Donald, of Columbus, Ohio; Lauren, of Manhattan; and Tracey Barrentine of Annandale, Va.; five brothers, John Lawler of Yonkers; Lawrence Lawler of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; Robert Lawler of Seaford, N.Y.; Brendan Lawler, of Katonah, N.Y.; and James Lawler, of Staten Island; four sisters, Therese Lawler Stevenson of Bedford, N.Y.; Kathleen Lawler Gerard of Cortlandt Manor, N.Y.; Patricia Lawler Odell of Parlin, N.J.; and Joan Lawler Cirone of San Luis Obispo, Calif.; and six grandchildren.       
         Erna Furman, an expert on grief in children and a child psychoanalyst who helped develop a teamwork therapy involving teachers, parents and therapists, died on Aug. 9 in Cleveland. She was 76.         The cause was lung cancer, said a spokeswoman for the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development, where she worked for about 50 years.         The Perkins Center used psychoanalytic ideas to help children deal with emotional problems and incorporated the idea of team treatment, which helped parents understand children's actions.         Mrs. Furman wrote, edited and contributed to books based on research at the center.         The book ''A Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement,'' which she worked on with the psychoanalyst Dr. Anna Freud in the 1970's, challenged the idea that children who lose a parent do not need the same attention that adults do. She showed that even toddlers can be helped to mourn a parent. The work won the American Medical Writers Association Book Award in 1975.         Mrs. Furman's book ''Toddlers and Their Mothers'' describes her findings from a 1980's research project on the importance of the mother-child relationship, particularly in the second and third years of life.         Mrs. Furman was born Erna Mary Poppe in Vienna on June 14, 1926. In 1938, her family fled to Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis. Four years later, however, she was sent to the Terezin concentration camp, near Prague.         While there, she kept a journal and drew portraits of other captives, many of them children whom she befriended and helped care for. Some of her drawings were later exhibited, to critical acclaim, in museums, including ones in Tokyo and Los Angeles.         Mrs. Furman, who was educated at the Academy of Commerce in Prague, came to the United States in the late 1940's. She received many honors for her contributions to child psychoanalysis and was made an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 1999.         Dr. Robert Furman, her husband of 48 years and her colleague, died Sept. 21 at 78. He was known for helping develop the Hannah Perkins Center and the Cleveland Center for Research in Child Development. He was the first director of the Hannah Perkins Center.         ''In many ways, it was the couple together, Dr. and Mrs. Furman, who made the Hannah Perkins Center what it is today,'' said Barbara Streeter, the center's therapy director.         The Furmans are survived by two daughters, Lydia Furman Peter of Cleveland and Tanya Furman Larson of State College, Pa.; and three grandchildren.         Correction:  October 9, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on Sept. 30 about Erna Furman, a child psychoanalyst and an expert on grief, gave a misspelled name in some references to the center where she practiced. It is the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development, not Hannah. Because of an editing error, Mrs. Furman's maiden name was misspelled. It was Popper, not Poppe. The article misstated the timing of Mrs. Furman's immigration to the United States. It occurred in the 1950's, not the 40's.         The obituary also misstated the role of the psychoanalyst Anna Freud in Mrs. Furman's book ''A Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement.'' Dr. Freud wrote an introduction; she did not contribute to the text.       
         Kim Hunter, whose eclectic 60-year career included an Oscar, two Emmy nominations and a Broadway triumph with her portrayal of Stella in the legendary 1947 debut of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' died on Wednesday at her New York apartment. She was 79.         A founding member of the Actors Studio whose screen career was temporarily derailed by the Hollywood blacklists of the 1950's, Ms. Hunter was recently hospitalized for a fall and had been in declining health. She died of a heart attack in her apartment above the Cherry Lane Theater in the West Village, said her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.         Ms. Hunter caught the acting bug in elementary school and was never a snob about the roles she chose, mixing highly demanding parts with smaller ones in B-movies, long stints in regional theater, television guest appearance and even a running role on an ABC soap opera, ''The Edge of Night,'' in 1979 and 1980.         But without doubt the roles for which she is most remembered are Stella Kowalski, Marlon Brando's passionate and beleaguered wife in the stage and film versions of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire,'' and Dr. Zira, the coquettish simian with a fondness for Charlton Heston in the 1968 film ''Planet of the Apes.''         The role of Stella also won her an Academy Award for best supporting actress when the director Elia Kazan adapted his Broadway production to the screen. The scenes of an anguished Stanley Kowalski (Mr. Brando), disheveled and grimy, screaming up to his wife -- ''Stella!'' -- in the backyard of their seedy New Orleans home, and of Ms. Hunter's sexually charged descent on a winding staircase into his arms, have become iconic cinematic moments.         Feisty, occasionally profane, Ms. Hunter frequently told interviewers that she had no use for the trappings of Hollywood stardom that had always eluded her.         ''The work itself has been my life,'' she said in 1999. ''I was never in this for jazzy stardom, and as far as that's concerned, I've never had it. Doesn't matter to me.''         Ms. Hunter was born in Detroit, and her father died four years later. Her mother and stepfather moved the family to Miami Beach when she was 10, and there she developed a taste for the theater.         ''I was lonely growing up,'' she said. ''My only brother was nine years older and had little time for me. So I picked friends out of books and played let's-pretend games, acting out their characters before a mirror.''         Before long she had an acting coach and made her stage debut at 17 in the title role of ''Penny Wise'' at the Miami Women's Club. Later she took roles with stock companies around the country. At the Pasadena Playhouse in California, in ''Arsenic and Old Lace,'' she was spotted by a talent scout and signed to a contract with the producer David O. Selznick.         For her 1943 screen debut, Selznick loaned her to the horror-film producer Val Lewton, for whom she played a young woman battling devil worshipers in ''The Seventh Victim.''         Shortly afterward, Ms. Hunter took a supporting role in the Ginger Rogers film ''Tender Comrade,'' about young women living communally during World War II, a film that struck some as pro-Soviet. It was cited, years later, as a reason that her name appeared in ''Red Channels,'' a 1950's pamphlet naming suspected Communist sympathizers.         Ms. Hunter, a liberal Democrat, had been a vocal supporter of civil rights, though she never belonged to the Communist Party. She said she traced her problems with the blacklist to a world peace symposium that she helped sponsor in 1949. No one ever announced that she was on a blacklist, she said.         ''Gradually it became sort of clear,'' she said. ''I think CBS was first. I was on the blacklist at CBS. No more CBS television. Then I think ABC dropped out and then, finally, it was NBC. And then by that time, I won my Oscar for the movie of 'Streetcar,' but I could not work in films. The last film I made was in 1951.''         Her hiatus from the screen lasted until 1956, when she appeared opposite Bette Davis in ''Storm Center,'' about book-burning. ''I thought, uh-oh, here we go again,'' she said. But her political problems did not reignite.         Ms. Hunter was one of the few forgiving voices when many in Hollywood rebelled against awarding Mr. Kazan a special Oscar in 1999. He had never apologized for naming names to Congressional investigators during the blacklist days.         ''The whole business is dumb,'' she told one interviewer. ''Artistic achievement and the mistake someone made years ago don't belong together.''         The ''Streetcar'' role came about because Selznick's wife Irene remembered the actress when it came time to cast the role of Stella. The play opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York, but rehearsals were held on the roof of the New Amsterdam Theater.         ''Tennessee sat way in the back and when he had a thought about something, he'd write a note and come down to where we were working, reach over and tuck the note into Kazan's coat pocket,'' Ms. Hunter said.         Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson praised the entire cast. ''All act not only with color and style, but with insight,'' he wrote.         Ms. Hunter's 1944 marriage to William Baldwin ended in divorce in 1946. The couple had one child, Kathryn, now of Stamford, Conn., who took the name of Ms. Hunter's second husband, Robert Emmett. Emmett, also an actor, died in 2000. The couple had a son, Sean Robert, also of Stamford, and Ms. Hunter is survived by six grandchildren.         As for her other most celebrated role, Ms. Hunter said ''Planet of the Apes'' was a project she respected. ''I thought it was a damned interesting script and a challenge for all of us,'' she said.         She spent hours at the Bronx Zoo, she said, studying primate behavior. But the project turned out to be more of a challenge than she had anticipated, largely because of the cumbersome makeup. ''The only part of me uncovered was my eyeballs,'' she said. ''I had to breathe through my upper lip. It was wild.''         Ms. Hunter also appeared opposite Humphrey Bogart in the 1952 drama ''Deadline USA,'' and drew critical praise in ''Lilith'' (1964) and ''The Swimmer'' (1968), among other roles. More recently, she had a small role in ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (1997).         ''Acting is my life,'' she said in 1994. ''It doesn't get easier. It gets harder. I find it more challenging as I do it and realize how much more has to go into it. But I thank God I am in a profession where there is no retirement age.''       
         Quita Brodhead, a painter of colorful figurative and abstract paintings for more than 80 years, died on Sept. 4 in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 101 and lived in Wayne, Pa.         She had a vibrant style that continued to evolve through her life. Her early work was mostly nudes and still lifes, influenced by Cézanne and Matisse. But starting in the 1950's her work became more abstract but kept her signature bright colors.         Ms. Brodhead was born Marie Waggaman Berl on March 5, 1901, and studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Her first New York show was in 1938. Her father used to call her Mariequita -- Little Marie -- hence her nickname.         Her work is in the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the Delaware Art Museum, the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, N.Y., and other museums. Her last show, at a college, closed on Aug. 30.         She is survived by three children, Edith Good of Charlottesville, Va.; Truxtun Brodhead of Niantic, Conn.; and Charles Brodhead of Alexandria, Va.; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren. Her marriage to Truxtun Read Brodhead ended in divorce.         Grace Glueck wrote in The New York Times of Ms. Brodhead's centenary exhibition: ''The gifts of long life and the talent to live it rewardingly do not go to many. Ms. Brodhead is quite simply a phenomenon.''       
         Elizabeth Coblentz, an Amish homemaker who wrote a syndicated cooking column by hand beneath a kerosene lantern, a kitchen chronicle that touched on everything from the merits of Belgian horses to coping with grief, died on Tuesday in Blue Springs, Mo. She was 66.         The cause was an aneurysm, said Kevin Williams, her editor at Oasis Newsfeatures, which distributed her column to 105 newspapers, with more than two million readers.         A member of the strict Old Order Amish, who avoid most modern conveniences, she lived on a farm near Geneva, Ind., without running water, electricity, plumbing or a telephone. She traveled primarily by horse-drawn buggy, sewed her family's clothes and canned fruits and vegetables. She answered questions many readers had never thought to ask, including how to cook a meal for 76 children.         She mailed in her weekly columns, but Mr. Williams sometimes did not have time to mail his editing questions, so he would wire daisies with a card enclosed. One asked: ''How much sugar in that cream pie recipe?'' Mr. Williams had prepaid Express Mail envelopes at her home in which she could reply.         Mrs. Coblentz's columns seemed to be ripped from the pages of a 19th-century church bulletin, with their descriptions of quilting bees, children's funerals, sleigh rides and walking barefoot in warm spring soil. She told of baking 70 pies and 14 plates of ''nothings,'' a traditional Amish pastry, for her daughter's wedding.         In one column -- she called them letters -- she described a day that began at 4 a.m. with cooking breakfast of fried potatoes, eggs and bacon. The 11 a.m. entry: ''Went in to get dinner, as I've got menfolk working hard, hauling loads and loads of manure with the manure spreader that is driven by a team of horses.''         Her religious faith was a constant theme. But food, of the most comfortable kind, was her main topic, from Aunt Hilty's cinnamon rolls to putting up pumpkin pickles to churning a double batch of hot pepper butter. Among her recipes were those for sauerkraut bread, watermelon preserves and dandelion jelly.         The overall effect of her columns was an insight into the way of life and fundamental values of the Amish.         ''You would not notice much difference in our life now from when I was a girl or my mother was a girl,'' Mrs. Coblentz said in an Associated Press interview in 2000.         Elizabeth Coblentz was born in Berne, Ind., on July 18, 1936. She had six sisters and one brother and grew up on a farm. She left school after ninth grade, in accordance with Amish custom. She worked in a sugar factory, cleaned houses and married young. Starting in 1952, she wrote community news for a nationally distributed Amish newspaper.         Mr. Williams discovered her in 1991, after having done a research paper on the Amish as a college freshman. After having the idea of an Amish cooking column, he ran into Mrs. Coblentz by chance.         The first newspaper to take the column was The Quincy Herald-Whig of Quincy, Ill. It now appears in papers from Newton, N.J., to Indianapolis to Tacoma. But Mrs. Coblentz's picture does not appear with it. Following Amish tradition rooted in biblical passages that decry ''graven images,'' she refused to be photographed, appear on television or allow her voice to be taped.         But she had nothing against personal appearances and was on a publicity tour to promote her new book when she died. The book, ''The Amish Cook: Recipes and Recollections From an Old Order Amish Family,'' is to be published in November by Ten Speed Press of Berkeley, Calif. Her earlier work, ''The Best of the Amish Cook,'' a collection of her newspaper columns, was published by Oasis in two volumes.         On her tour, she traveled with Mr. Williams by car, as the Amish faith permits people to use technology as long as it does not intrude on their lives, he said. Owning an auto was out of the question for Mrs. Coblentz, Mr. Williams said, because it would have brought the whole world within her reach. Riding with someone is a compromise most Amish are willing to make, he said.         Her husband, Benjamin, a carpenter, died in 2000, throwing her into a depression that Mr. Williams said he believes led to her death. More than 3,000 readers sent cards and 5,000 sent e-mail messages to the syndicate that distributed her column.         She is survived by her daughters, Leah Shetler, Verena and Susan Coblentz, Elizabeth Wengerd, Lovina Eicher and Emma Schwartz, all of Geneva; her sons, Amos of Berne and Albert of Geneva; her sisters, Leah Girod of Berne, Lovina Swartzentruber of LaGrange, Ind., Emma Schwartz of Berne and Salome Hilty and Barbara Schwartz, both of Geneva; her brother, Chris A. Graber of Bryant, Ind.; and 35 grandchildren.         Many of her readers seemed to feel close to her. In a letter before Mrs. Coblentz's death, Betty Watters of Independence, Mo., wrote, ''Your letters remind me of my mother -- her chickens, gardens, canning, cleaning, working every day in fields by Dad's side and clean-smelling laundry whipping and snapping in the fresh air and sunshine.''

         Tatyana M. Velikanova, a Soviet human rights activist who was a leading editor of the most important samizdat journal of human rights abuses and spent nearly nine years in prison camp and exile, died of cancer on Sept. 19. She was 70 and lived in Moscow.         Ms. Velikanova, a mathematician by profession, became a dissident in 1968, when she went to Red Square with her husband, Konstantin Babitsky, who was one of only seven people to demonstrate openly against the Soviet-led invasion of Czechoslovakia that crushed the Prague Spring reforms.         Mr. Babitsky was arrested and banished for several years to the far north of Russia. The next year, Ms. Velikanova helped found the Initiative Group for the Defense of Human Rights in the U.S.S.R., and became the backbone of the Chronicle of Current Events, a samizdat news bulletin, after the arrest of its founder, Natalya Gorbanevskaya. The chronicle was the main uncensored source of information about the dissident movement around the Soviet Union during the rule of Leonid I. Brezhnev.         At a time when photocopying machines were rare and kept literally under lock and key in Soviet offices, the compilers of the chronicle gathered information and then produced multiple copies by typing through layers of carbon paper.         The chronicle was written in a dry, telegraphic style, and defended all repressed groups, from Pentecostal believers to Jewish refuseniks, Russian Orthodox priests, Georgian nationalists, deported Crimean Tatars, and intellectuals and religious believers in the Baltic republics.         Ms. Velikanova herself was an observant Orthodox Christian.         She was arrested in 1979 on charges of ''anti-Soviet propaganda,'' and a report in the Chronicle around that time detailed official questioning of her sister about her ties to the West, as well as the interrogator's relaying his prisoner's request for a Bible and photographs of her grandchildren.         Ms. Velikanova received a nine-year sentence, serving four years in prison camp and then being exiled to a desolate part of Kazakhstan.         In a statement written during his own banishment from Moscow to the city of Gorky (now Nizhny Novgorod), Andrei D. Sakharov lauded Ms. Velikanova for her dedication to the cause of the oppressed, regardless of whether she agreed with their views. ''Her only consideration was whether someone had suffered injustice,'' he wrote.         During the reforms of Mikhail S. Gorbachev, Ms. Velikanova was allowed to return to Moscow before her nine-year term was fully served. In her final years, she lived out of the public eye, teaching math and Russian language and literature at a Moscow school until just months before her death.         She is survived by three children, Natalie Babitsky of France, Fyodor Babitsky of Moscow and Yulia Keidan of Italy; 13 grandchildren; two brothers, Andrew Velihan of Northport, N.Y., and Kirill Velikanov of Moscow; and two sisters, Yekaterina Velikanova of Moscow and Mary Velihan Grigorenko of New York City.       
         Catherine Connelly, who as an 11-year-old in 1904 escaped the inferno that burned the General Slocum, an excursion boat in the East River, died on Thursday at a nursing home in Wilton, Conn. She was 109 and was one of the last two survivors of the disaster, according to a commemorative group.         Maureen Enright, Mrs. Connelly's granddaughter, reported the death. Kenneth Leib, president of the General Slocum Memorial Association, said that only one General Slocum survivor remains alive: Adella Wotherspoon, 98, a retired teacher in Watchung, N.J.         ''I'm sorry, of course,'' Mrs. Wotherspoon said in a phone interview. ''She had a very long life. She was a very interesting person.''         Mrs. Connelly treasured her family more than anything, and she is survived by her two daughters Jeanne Meehan of Goshen, N.Y., and Elizabeth Reilly of Greenwich, Conn.; 27 grandchildren; 30 great-grandchildren; and 7 great-great-grandchildren.         She had all but one of her 11 babies at home, and made her own diapers. Mother's Days meant wall-to-wall flowers in the Manhattan apartment where she lived alone until she was 102. Her pleasures included cooking rich food, and her secret for longevity was a banana a day.         But every year in the weeks leading up to June 15, the anniversary of the disaster -- New York City's most lethal fire until Sept. 11, 2001 -- she would become sad. She remembered the boy shouting ''fire'' over a brass band, mothers and children with clothing on fire leaping into the swirling whirlpools of Hell Gate in the East River, dresses shredded in machinery. When it was all over, 1,021 of the 1,331 passengers on the Sunday School cruise on a sunny day were dead.         ''Sometimes he's very cruel, the man upstairs,'' Mrs. Connelly said in an interview with The New York Times in 1989.         Catherine Uhlmyer was born in Manhattan on April 4, 1893. Her father died before she was a year old, and her mother married John Gallagher. His last name became hers.         She grew up in what was known as Little Germany, an enclave between Houston and 14th Streets on the East Side. Pickles were a penny each, and stacks of rye bread with apple butter were the delicacy of the day. St. Mark's Lutheran Church on East Sixth Street was the place of worship for much of the community.         The church chartered the General Slocum, a wooden sidewheel steamboat, for the outing. A grocer who belonged to the church gave the Gallaghers, who were Roman Catholics, three tickets. But they needed one more. Mr. Gallagher had to work.         ''I went over to the store crying and they gave me a ticket,'' Mrs. Connelly said. ''I was never on a boat before.''         Nor did she ever set foot on one again.         The passengers boarded at 9:40 a.m. for the trip to Long Island for a picnic. After catching fire at Hell Gate, the General Slocum put ashore on North Brother Island at 10:40 and burned. Catherine Gallagher was rescued by a tugboat.         An investigation revealed that life jackets and fire hoses had fallen apart with age; lifeboats were wired in place; and the crew had never conducted a fire drill. Only the ship's captain went to prison.         In the days after the disaster, Little Germany's doorways were draped in black, and on June 18, 1904, the neighborhood saw 156 funerals. More than 600 households lost loved ones. Mrs. Connelly lost her mother, brother and sister. Mrs. Wotherspoon lost two sisters, two cousins and two aunts.         Catherine Gallagher first lived with her grandparents, then with an aunt and uncle. She dropped out of school at 13, and at 20 she married Thomas Connelly, a truck driver.         In Mrs. Connelly's later years, she was interviewed for many articles and television documentaries on the General Slocum, but she never lost her perspective.         ''You know,'' she said in the interview with The Times, ''you don't fully grasp the meaning of everything.''       
         Eileen Jackson Southern, a scholar of Renaissance and African-American music and the first black woman to be appointed a tenured full professor at Harvard University, died on Sunday at her home in Port Charlotte, Fla. She was 82.         As a researcher, author and teacher, Dr. Southern documented the history and scope of African-American contributions to American music. Much of her work remains in print.         ''The Music of Black Americans: A History'' (1971) is in its third edition (Norton, 1997). She also compiled the ''Biographical Dictionary of Afro-American and African Musicians'' (Greenwood, 1982) and ''The Music of Black Americans'' (Norton, third edition, 1997).         In 1973, with her husband, Prof. Joseph Southern, she founded Black Perspectives in Music, the first musicological journal on the study of black music. She edited the journal until it ceased publication in 1990.         She received a National Humanities Medal in 2001 for having ''helped transform the study and understanding of American music.'' She also received the 2000 Lifetime Achievement Award of the Society of American Music.         In a way, Eileen Southern's mission was prompted by a question she encountered while teaching at CUNY's York College in 1968. At issue was the inclusion of music in a black-studies curriculum. She recalled that a colleague asked, ''Besides jazz, what is there?''         Her life's work was meant to give an answer.         She traced the evolution of black choruses from church singing groups, and a startling number of black orchestras like the Negro Philharmonic Society of New Orleans. In the early 1900's, black and white audiences flocked to Carnegie Hall to hear the Clef Club Symphony Orchestra under its conductor James Reese Europe play music by black composers like Harry T. Burleigh and Samuel Coleridge-Taylor.         Eileen Jackson was born in Minneapolis and grew up in Chicago. Encouraged by her parents, whose home was a haven for black musicians, she studied piano and made her first concert appearance at age 7. She continued to give concerts on tour while pursuing her academic career and musicological studies until the mid-1950's.         She graduated in 1940 from the University of Chicago, where she received a master's degree the next year. Her thesis was ''The Use of Negro Folksong in Symphonic Form.'' Faced with racial discrimination, she started teaching at traditionally black colleges in Texas and Louisiana.         Moving to New York in 1954, she taught public school before joining the CUNY faculty of Brooklyn College in 1960. She became a full professor in 1972 at York College, where she also served as chairwoman of the music department.         In the 1950's she studied at New York University under the Renaissance music scholar Gustave Reese. She received her Ph.D. in 1961 with a dissertation about Renaissance music. It was published as ''The Buxheim Organ Book'' (Institute of Mediaeval Music, 1963).         Dr. Southern went to Harvard as a lecturer in 1974 and received a dual appointment in Afro-American studies and music in 1976. She headed the department of Afro-American studies from 1975 to 1979 and retired in 1987 as a professor emeritus.         She is survived by her husband of 60 years, Professor Southern; a daughter, April S. Reilly of Florence, Calif.; a son, Edward J., of Port Charlotte; a sister, Stella Hall of Chicago; and three grandchildren.         She was the editor of ''African American Theater: 'Out of Bondage' (1876), and 'Peculiar Sam: or The Underground Railroad' (1879)'' (Garland, 1994). She also wrote, with Dr. Josephine Wright, ''Images: Iconography of Music and Musicians in African-American Culture'' (Garland, 1998). Both are in print.         Dr. Southern remembered her reception at Harvard as far from cordial. In ''A Pioneer,'' an essay she contributed to the 1993 anthology ''Blacks at Harvard,'' she told of years of stress spent gaining respect for herself and the fledgling department she headed.         But she invoked her role model, W. E. B. Du Bois. ''Like him, I went to Harvard because it was a great opportunity for me as a black female scholar, and I accepted the reality of racial and sex discrimination,'' she wrote. ''In its role as nurturer of scholars, Harvard never let me down!''       
         Elizabeth Longford, the best-selling biographer and political activist who was the widow of the social reformer Lord Longford and the matriarch of a family that bred other well-known writers, died on Wednesday at her home in Sussex. She was 96.         From her school years through the nearly seven decades of her marriage to Lord Longford, she was famous for her intelligence, beauty, vitality and vivacity.         She was already an academic and social success at Oxford University when John Betjeman, one of the many literary figures she befriended, called her ''the aesthetes' moll.'' Quintin Hogg, who later as Lord Hailsham became a Conservative lord chancellor, said, ''There was not an undergraduate who would not consider it a privilege to hold an umbrella over her.''         Among her seven surviving children are the writers Antonia Fraser, Rachel Billington and Thomas Pakenham and the poet Judith Kazantzis. A daughter, Catherine, a magazine writer, died in a car crash at age 23 in 1969, and a prominent prize for women in journalism is named for her.         Lady Longford confessed to having ''an addiction to motherhood'' and continued to have children even after her Labor Party handlers said it was getting in the way of her parliamentary career. She ran for office unsuccessfully twice and had to bow out of a third contest, in which she was the favorite, because of pressure over her intent to have more children.         She was born Elizabeth Harman and was to be known as Elizabeth Pakenham for the first three decades of her marriage to Frank Pakenham; they became Lord and Lady Longford in 1961. She was the daughter of two Harley Street physicians and had a privileged upbringing.         Her biographies are known for their strong narrative lines and their wealth of research and detail, drawn from personal visits to historic sites. Her obituary in The Guardian of London said that she advised her children and grandchildren that ''not to study history would be like living in a house with no windows.''         The Longford marriage was one of the most celebrated in Britain. As partners, they deeply influenced each other.         She steered him away from his early Conservative Party enthusiasm to her socialist convictions. He persuaded her to convert to Roman Catholicism in 1946, a step he took in 1940.         Lord Longford, who died at 95 in August 2001, was a Labor peer famous for championing social outcasts and unpopular causes. When he was lampooned in later life as everything from an endearing eccentric to a bumbling loon, she was his passionate defender.         He was as unkempt as she was well turned out, and their contrasting appearances illustrated the nature of their partnership. Lord Longford always credited his wife with providing him with the self-control and common sense that he lacked.         Auberon Waugh, a godson, once said, ''I think he sees himself a little bit as a knight errant going out to do things which will please her.''         Lord Longford said at one of the couple's many anniversary parties: ''I think it would be very difficult to become bored with Elizabeth. No one else has ever been.''         Her writing career began after her third campaign for Parliament in 1950 and running after having had her eighth child. She began writing articles on family life and parenting for Lord Beaverbrook's Express newspapers. A collection of them, ''Points for Parents,'' was published by George Weidenfeld in 1956, and from there she moved on to larger subjects.         She received good reviews for her history ''Jameson's Raid'' in 1960 and then achieved widespread success with the biography ''Victoria R. I.'' in 1964; a two-volume life of the Duke of Wellington, ''The Years of the Sword,'' in 1969; and ''Pillar of State'' in 1972.         By the 1980's Lady Longford, who had begun public life as an ardent socialist, had become close to the royal family, and her next major biography was ''Elizabeth R,'' in 1983. She wrote about royals and political figures into her 90's, publishing her last book, a brief history called ''Queen Victoria,'' in 1999.         Sarah Bradford, a biographer of George VI, wrote in The Independent of London that Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother had said she felt that women could be divided into two groups, either beautiful and stupid or clever and plain, ''except Elizabeth Longford, of course.''       
         Millicent Hearst Boudjakdji, president of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation and a director of the Hearst Corporation, died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said Paul Luthringer, a spokesman for the Hearst Corporation.         A granddaughter of William Randolph Hearst, Mrs. Boudjakdji (pronounced Bood-JACK-gee) was named president of the foundation, an independent private philanthropy, in January, 2001. She also established her own charitable foundation, the Boudjakdji Foundation, which focused on education and the arts.         Mrs. Boudjakdji had served on the Hearst Corporation's board since 1986.         Millicent Hearst Boudjakdji, the daughter of David Whitmire Hearst and Hope Chandler Hearst, was born on March 24, 1939, in Los Angeles and graduated from the University of California at Los Angeles in 1961.         She is survived by her husband, Raouf Boudjakdji; four children; three grandchildren; her mother; and a brother.         Correction:  October 29, 2002, Tuesday  An obituary on Friday about Millicent Hearst Boudjakdji, president of the William Randolph Hearst Foundation, misstated the date of her death. It was Oct. 16, not Oct. 23.       
         Vera G. List, a forward-looking philanthropist whose causes included contemporary art, opera, education and social justice, died Thursday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 94.         Mrs. List, who received the National Medal of Arts from President Bill Clinton in 1996, was born Vera Glaser in 1908 in Brookline, Mass., the daughter of a housepainter from Latvia. She credited her interest in art and music to her mother, who despite an often constrained budget maintained a beautifully decorated house.         She attended Simmons College, and in 1930 married Albert A. List, from Fall River, Mass., who made his family's grocery the basis of a business empire that eventually included RKO Theaters.         Mrs. List began collecting art almost immediately. As her husband's wealth grew, her art purchases and their philanthropy kept pace. The saying in the family was that ''the money was his, the ideas were hers,'' her daughters said.         The Lists' beneficiaries included the Metropolitan Opera, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Jewish Theological Seminary, the Jewish Museum and the New School for Social Research, now New School University. They built art centers at M.I.T., Brown University and Swarthmore College, and endowed professorships at various universities and medical schools.         Mrs. List endowed art-lending programs (and provided them with prints) for students at the New School and M.I.T. Another endowment enabled New School students to attend the Metropolitan Opera for $5.         The Albert A. List Foundation, formed in the 1950's, donated money to the construction of Lincoln Center. The foundation also paid for much of the center's art, including the large two-piece sculpture by Henry Moore that dominates its reflecting pool.         Mrs. List was particularly proud of the List Art Posters program at Lincoln Center, which invited contemporary artists to design posters for cultural events.         Mrs. List also became an avid collector of modern and contemporary art, especially sculpture. The List family's sculpture collection included works by artists from Giacometti to Joel Shapiro and a full-length portrait of Mrs. List by George Segal.         Mrs. List was on the boards of the Jewish Museum and the American Federation of Arts. But she may be best known in the art world for helping Marcia Tucker, a former curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, establish the New Museum of Contemporary Art, now in SoHo. It opened in 1977 in the Albert A. List Building at the New School on Fifth Avenue and 14th Street.         Although the Lists gave art to several New York museums, after her husband's death in 1987, Mrs. List sold much of her collection to have more money to give away. In her last years she supported programs with missions like reducing hate crimes or the birth rate. She liked to remember people by endowing lecture programs, like the one named for Barbara Jordan at the New School, or providing fellowships, like one for New School students from Poland, named for Katarzyna Kalwinska, a Polish Catholic who hid Jews who had escaped from concentration camps.         She is survived by three daughters, Olga Mack of New York City, Carol Schwartz of Denver, and Viki List, of Rosemont, Pa.; 11 grandchildren; and 23 great-grandchildren. One daughter, Jo Levinson, died last year.       
         Patricia Hochschild Labalme, an executive and a trustee of foundations that give major support to education and scholarly research as well as a scholar of the Renaissance, died on Friday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 75 and also lived in West Cornwall, Conn.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Dr. Labalme was a trustee and the head of the humanities program of the Gladys Krieble Delmas Foundation, which supports academic research, particularly on Venetian history.         She was formerly associate director of the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J. Most recently, she was a visitor in historical studies at the institute, finishing a book about the Venetian diarist Marino Sanudo.         She was a trustee and past executive director of the Renaissance Society of America, a former trustee of the American Academy in Rome and a former president and life trustee of the Brearley School board.         Patricia Hochschild was born in Manhattan and graduated from Bryn Mawr College. She received a master's and a doctorate from Harvard.         She also taught and lectured at colleges including Wellesley, Barnard, Hunter and New York University.         Dr. Labalme is survived by her husband, George Labalme Jr.; three daughters, Jennifer R. Labalme of Indianapolis, Lisa G. Osterland of Montreal and Victoria A. Labalme of Manhattan; a son, Henry G., of Manhattan and West Cornwall; a sister, Ann H. Poole of Princeton; and six grandchildren.       
         Madeline Greenleaf Jaynes, a researcher, librarian and editor, died yesterday at her home in Brooklyn. She was 59.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Jaynes was a news researcher for The New York Times from 1971 to 1978 and later for CNN in Atlanta. For the last five years, she worked for Time magazine as assistant editor on the international edition. Earlier, she had lectured in English at Toyama University in Toyama City, Japan.         Ms. Jaynes was born in Orange, N.J., grew up in Short Hills and graduated from Millburn High School. She received a bachelor's degree in history from Earlham College in 1965 and a master's degree in library science two years later from the University of Michigan.         She is survived by her husband, Gregory Jaynes; a sister, Lisa Greenleaf Miller of New Haven; a brother, Newcomb Greenleaf of St. Johnsbury, Vt.; a stepson, Todd Jaynes of Dahlonega, Ga.; a stepdaughter, Whitney Jaynes Laidlaw; and two grandchildren.       
         Beatrice Renfield, a philanthropist who had been a longtime member of the board of directors of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York, died on Wednesday at a medical center in Manhattan. She was 88 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Renfield, whose family had owned a wine- and spirits-importing company, donated $1 million earlier this year to endow the Beatrice Renfield Nursing Research Program in the Center for Home Care Policy and Research of the Visiting Nurse Service of New York. She was also a benefactor of the Yale School of Nursing and Beth Israel Medical Center, of which she was a trustee. The medical center's Beatrice Renfield Center for Nurses opened in September.         She was a native of Newark and attended New York University.         Her husband, Harold L. Renfield, who predeceased her, had assumed her surname when they wed. She is survived by a son, Robert L.; a daughter, Anna Jo Dubow; nine grandchildren; two great-grandchildren; a brother, Joseph; and a sister, Jean Miller.       
         Mary T. Kinnear, a former member of the Smithsonian National Board and a trustee of the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Conn., died on Saturday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 73.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Kinnear was the wife of James W. Kinnear, former president and chief executive of Texaco and chairman of the Metropolitan Opera who will step down later this month and become honorary chairman.         Mrs. Kinnear was a graduate of the Ethel Walker School and attended Sarah Lawrence College.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Kinnear is survived by two daughters, Robin Kinnear of Birmingham, Ala., and Susan Kinnear Neul of Summit, N.J.; two sons, J. Wesley Kinnear IV of Mill Valley, Calif., and William Mitchell Kinnear of Wilmette, Ill.; and seven grandchildren.       
         Percy Maxim Lee, a former president of the League of Women Voters of the United States, died on Saturday in New London, Conn. She was 96 and lived in Mystic, Conn.         Born July 4, 1906, in Hartford, Mrs. Lee was elected to the national board of the league in 1944, and served four terms as its president, from 1950 to 1958.         She was also a founder and trustee of the League of Women Voters Education Fund, the organization's educational arm, and was president of the league's Overseas Education Fund, which encourages political activity among women abroad, from 1959 to 1964.         Mrs. Lee is survived by two sons, John M., of Bloomfield, Conn., and Hamilton, of Mystic; two daughters, Percy Langstaff of Stamford, Conn., and Frances Heminway of Putney, Vt.; and 10 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Segal Lowe, a retired public relations executive and journalist who managed communications for the National Endowment for the Arts from 1970 to 1986, died on Thursday in Washington. She was 93 and lived in the Georgetown section of Washington.         She and her husband, Herman Lowe, who died in 1961, were Washington correspondents for Variety, TV Guide and other publications.         Born in New York City, she grew up in Pennsylvania and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Pennsylvania.         Her survivors include a daughter, Lesley Lowe Israel of Royal Oak, Md.; a son, Roger Bernard Lowe of Arlington, Va.; two grandchildren; four great-grandchildren; and a brother, Irving R. Segal of Philadelphia.       
         Margaret Taylor Hancock, whose many-hued family tree sprang to life in a book by her daughter that became a meditation on the meaning of race in America, died on Tuesday in Branford, Conn. She was 90 and lived in North Haven.         Mrs. Hancock was the product of a multiracial, multi-ethnic family and grew up black. Her siblings, from whom she was separated at age 4, grew up white. In 1994, Simon & Schuster published ''The Sweeter the Juice: A Family Memoir in Black and White,'' a portrait of life in the black bourgeoisie drawn by her daughter, Shirlee Taylor Haizlip.         Mrs. Hancock, born Margaret Morris in Washington and trained as a teacher, married a black minister and became a dedicated ''voluntary Negro.'' Her siblings went through life in white society, and it was not until 76 years later, in 1992, that she was reunited with a sister.         Her daughter, Mrs. Haizlip, used all means, from private eyes to public records, to trace their many strands of ancestry and relate their stories. There was, for instance, the great-grandmother who voyaged from Ireland to escape the potato famine and married a half-black slave.         He had learned to play the piccolo from his Scottish father, and, having fled from Virginia, played it in a Union Army band during the Civil War. There were African, American Indian, English and possibly Italian forebears, all with stories to tell.         In the 1900 census, Margaret Morris's family was classified as mulatto; it split only later into white and black branches. Young Margaret attended Miner's Teachers' College in Washington and, in 1933, married the Rev. Julian A. Taylor, son of a prominent Washington clergyman.         She was a co-founder of the N.A.A.C.P. branch in Ansonia, Conn., where her husband was a Baptist minister, and became active in the state's foster care system. She personally fostered six girls and found places for many others.         Mr. Taylor died in 1981. In 1987 she married Graham Hancock of New Haven, who died in 1993. She is survived by three daughters, Mrs. Haizlip of Los Angeles; Dr. Jewelle Taylor Gibbs of Palo Alto, Calif.; and Patricia Taylor Brown of North Haven; 12 grandchildren; and 3 great-grandchildren.         When she reunited with her older sister, Grace Morris Cramer of Anaheim, Calif., after 76 years, they had ''six good years together,'' commuting coast to coast, Mrs. Haizlip said yesterday. Mrs. Cramer died in 1998.       
         Fay Bennett Watts, who led national efforts to help farm laborers and the rural poor, died on Dec. 19 in Shelburne, Vt.         She was 88 and lived in Wake Robin, a retirement community in Vermont.         Known professionally as Fay Bennett, she held posts at the National Sharecroppers Fund from 1952 through 1974, directing attention to rural poverty.         In the 1950's she helped form the National Council for Agricultural Life and Labor, an alliance of dozens of national organizations that sought to spotlight the difficulties facing migrant farm workers to generate laws to protect them.         During the Kennedy and Johnson administrations, she served on the National Advisory Committee on Rural Areas Development for the Department of Agriculture.         She was born in Springfield, Mass., and graduated from Simmons College in Boston.         Her husband, Rowland Watts, a civil liberties lawyer, died in 1995.         She is survived by a daughter, Linda Watts of Shelburne; two sons, David Watts of Charlotte, Vt., and Lanny Watts of Burlington, Vt.; and four grandchildren.       
         Anna Hamburger, a longtime director of International Rescue Committee operations in Europe that aided refugees from Soviet bloc nations, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         She helped thousands of people who had fled Eastern Europe begin new lives in America.         Born Anna Walling in Cedarhurst, N.Y., she attended Swarthmore. She married Norman Matson in 1934. He died in 1966.         She is survived by her husband, the New Yorker writer Philip Hamburger, whom she married in 1968; a son, Peter Matson; 10 grandchildren; and 14 great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Stephenson Mahoney, an unwavering advocate for national health research and programs, died on Nov. 29 at her home in Washington. She was 103.         Working with the philanthropist Mary Woodard Lasker, Mrs. Mahoney was instrumental in the growth of the National Institutes of Health, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services through which the federal government finances medical research.         Starting as the one-room Laboratory of Hygiene on Staten Island in 1887, the agency, now comprising 27 institutes and centers for specific topics, is housed on a 300-acre campus in Bethesda, Md. Its budget for 2002 is $23.4 billion.         After World War II, Mrs. Mahoney and Mrs. Lasker lobbied to enlarge the agency, then a single institute. ''It is hard to realize today that government-subsidized research in the 1940's, when Florence Mahoney started her efforts, actually was controversial,'' said Judith Robinson, author of ''Noble Conspirator: Florence S. Mahoney and the Rise of the National Institutes of Health'' (The Francis Press, 2001).         With charm and persistence, Mrs. Mahoney and Mrs. Lasker pressed powerful politicians to support research on health issues.         ''When I wanted to get things done, I started at the top,'' Mrs. Mahoney told Ms. Robinson.         And the top often meant the president, whether it was Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson or Jimmy Carter.         Jack Valenti, a friend of Mrs. Mahoney, was a special assistant to the president in the Johnson administration.         ''When I would tell him that Mary Lasker and Florence Mahoney wanted to see him, the president would groan,'' Mr. Valenti said. ''He'd say, 'Oh, my God, these two women are going to bankrupt this country.' And they usually got what they wanted out of him.''         Eventually, the women focused on specific areas, with Mrs. Mahoney taking a special interest in aging and mental health.         In the 1960's Mrs. Mahoney began urging lawmakers to create an Institute on Aging at the N.I.H. She said the institute should concentrate on improving the quality of the lives of older Americans, not just their longevity.         In 1972, Mrs. Mahoney persuaded Senator Thomas F. Eagleton and Representative Paul G. Rogers to sponsor a bill creating such an institute. It passed, but President Richard M. Nixon would not sign it.         The next year, the bill was reintroduced, and Mr. Nixon, embroiled in the Watergate scandal, again would not sign the measure. But Mrs. Mahoney kept up her efforts.         In the spring of 1974, the bill was passed a third time, and on May 31, 1974, Mr. Nixon signed it, just months before he resigned under the threat of impeachment.         ''There would not be an Institute on Aging without Florence Mahoney,'' Mr. Eagleton said. ''She was the creator and instigator of it. I was simply her messenger.''         Florence Amelia Sheets was born on a farm near Muncie, Ind., on April 20, 1899, the eldest of three daughters born to Abraham L. and Julia T. Stephenson Sheets. She later adopted her mother's maiden name as part of hers.         Ms. Robinson wrote that Mrs. Mahoney remembered feeling a sense of social responsibility for the first time at age 10 when she was riding in a friend's pony cart.         ''There was an orphans' home nearby, which we passed once,'' Ms. Robinson quoted Mrs. Mahoney as saying. ''We didn't know what it was, so one time we thought we'd stop and find out. We went in, and I'll never forget it; I can still see it. Everything was gray. Even the children were all gray. It was all so depressing. That was my first feeling of social conscience.''         After graduating from Muncie High School in 1917, she enrolled in the Battle Creek Normal School of Physical Education in Michigan, where she studied anatomy and kinesiology. She taught physical education in Moose Jaw, Saskatchewan, and studied dance in New York with an Italian ballet master whose students included Fred Astaire. She also took medical courses.         On Oct. 13, 1926, she married Daniel J. Mahoney, a Cox newspaper executive who became publisher of The Miami Daily News. They had two sons and divorced in 1950.         Mrs. Mahoney moved to Washington, turning her Georgetown house into a sort of salon, where politicians and scientists discussed issues over dinner.         Dr. Robert N. Butler, the first director of the National Institute on Aging, said that the dining room table was on the small side and that he believed it was by design, to encourage robust discussion.         Mrs. Mahoney's house had another claim to fame. Mr. Valenti, now the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said ''The Exorcist'' was filmed there.         Mrs. Mahoney is survived by a son, J. Michael Mahoney of Larkspur, Calif., and grandchildren.
