         Dominique de Menil, a connoisseur, art collector and creator with her husband, John, of the Menil Foundation in Houston, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 89.         Mrs. de Menil and her husband, whose fortune came from oil-well technology, became widely known for commissioning the nondenominational Rothko Chapel near Houston, designed by Philip Johnson and dedicated in 1971. With its somber meditational paintings by Mark Rothko and its adjacent sculpture, ''Broken Obelisk'' by Barnett Newman, it soon became a place of ecumenical pilgrimage.         As collectors, the de Menils cut a very wide swath. Their first serious purchase was a Cezanne watercolor that Mr. de Menil had bought in New York in 1945 on the advice of the Rev. Marie-Alain Couturier, a French Dominican priest and a friend of theirs. Thereafter, everything that was of true quality interested them, from Etruscan art to Cycladic sculptures, Byzantine bronzes, African tribal art, the Surrealist paintings of Max Ernst and the recent work of Cy Twombly, an American painter long resident in Italy.         Public awareness of the size and quality of what they had bought was heightened when the Menil Collection museum opened in Houston in 1987. Mrs. de Menil had commissioned the Italian architect Renzo Piano to build a museum that would ''look small on the outside and be big on the inside.''         Its apparent modesty, allied to a seraphic perfection of detail, made it one of the most beautiful museum buildings in the United States. With no admission charge, no membership and no museum shops, it fostered the contemplation of an astonishingly wide range of objects, from antiquity to the Parisian and American avant-garde of recent times.         The full breadth of the de Menil art collection became evident when a massive selection from it, titled ''Rhyme and Reason,'' was shown at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1984.         Mrs. de Menil's attitude to art was not at all that of an esthete who stood apart from or above mundane concerns. One of the de Menils' earlier ventures in Houston was to take a derelict movie house, the De Luxe Theater, in a neighborhood of mostly black residents and to turn it into a center for exhibitions of works by black artists through the ages. She chose and installed those exhibitions herself. Starting in 1960, the de Menils financed a research project that culminated in a monumental publication called ''The Image of the Black in Western Art.''         From 1973 onward, the Rothko Chapel doubled as a center for colloquiums aimed at fostering mutual understanding on issues affecting justice and freedom throughout the world. The first colloquium drew scholars from Lebanon, Iran, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Japan, Italy, the United States and Canada.         In 1991 the Rothko Chapel marked its 20th anniversary with a joint award with the Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation, founded in 1986 with former President Jimmy Carter. Nelson Mandela was the keynote speaker and received the special Rothko Chapel award. The projects were not simply highminded pastimes for Mrs. de Menil. Despite her gentle bearing and soft-spoken ways, those who knew her said she was fervently committed to the causes championed at the Rothko  colloquiums.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. de Menil was a discreet but seemingly ubiquitous force for understanding in many areas of life. The house in Houston in which she and her husband lived and raised their five children was open to people of every age, nationality, color and religion.         Dominique de Menil, the daughter of Conrad Schlumberger and his wife, Louise Delpech, was born in Paris on March 23, 1908. She studied mathematics and physics at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1927-28. Though born in a bastion of French Protestantism, she converted to Catholicism to marry John (then Jean) de Menil in 1931.         In 1941 the de Menils left Nazi-occupied France and made their way to the United States, where Mr. de Menil was to represent the family firm of Schlumberger both in North and South America. Some years after they settled in Houston, they asked Philip Johnson to build them a house for them and their five children.         When it was completed in 1948, people told them that there had never been a flat roof in Houston. ''You'll never be able to sell it,'' they said. Mrs. de Menil said that she didn't mind about the market because she wasn't building to sell. ''Anyway,'' she said later, ''no sooner was our house built than you saw flat roofs everywhere.'' The house was also remarkable for the debut of a celebrated American couturier, Charles James, as an interior designer. It was his belief that only corridors and dark corners should have color, and that the living room should be kept quite plain. As an interior, at that or any other time, it was surprising.         After Mr. de Menil (by then called John, since he had become an American citizen) died in 1973, Mrs. de Menil continued their work. She maintained the Menil Foundation's commitment to two major scholarly enterprises -- the catalogue of the complete works of Magritte, by David Sylvester, and of Max Ernst, by Werner Spies.         Her most recent project was the recovery of a series of Byzantine frescoes on the subject of St. Themnianos from a church in the town of Lysi on the island of Cyprus. Permission was given for her to have them on indefinite loan from Cyprus, provided that they were installed in a chapel consecrated to the Greek Orthodox church. They were installed last February in a chapel designed by her son, Francois.         The French Government conferred on Mrs. de Menil the title of Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in 1984. Two years later, she received the National Medal of Arts from President Ronald Reagan.         In addition to her son Francois, she is survived by another son, Georges; three daughters, Marie-Christophe de Menil, Adelaide de Menil Carpenter and Philippa de Menil Friedrich; 11 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.         A funeral service is to be held on Saturday at 2 P.M. at St. Anne's Church in Houston.       
         Dorothy Hart Hirshon, a glamorous figure in New York society from the 1920's through the 40's who later became active in social, human rights and political causes, died Thursday in an automobile accident while driving near her home in Glen Cove, on Long Island. She was 89.         Frequently photographed and written about during her glittering earlier marriages to John Randolph Hearst and William S. Paley, she married Walter Hirshon, a stockbroker, in 1953. After their divorce in 1961, she became increasingly involved in education and philanthropic endeavors.         Described as ''one of the most beautiful girls in Southern California'' by Irene Selznick, Dorothy Hart was 19 when she met her first husband, Mr. Hearst, the third of William Randolph Hearst's five sons, while sailing on a yacht off Santa Barbara.         Mr. Hearst had not yet entered his first year at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, but the couple were married in New York in December 1927.         The groom dropped out of college after his freshman year and joined the Hearst Corporation, and the young marrieds became regulars in the glamorous cafe society of the period, out on the town almost every night.         Mr. Hearst, who had difficulty working with his powerful father, began drinking heavily. Mrs. Hearst, hoping to set an example for her husband, who rarely showed up for work, took a job writing a column for Harper's Bazaar.         Mrs. Hearst met Mr. Paley, the dashing head of the Columbia Broadcasting System, in 1931. According to friends, it was immediately obvious that he was determined to marry her.         After some months, she went to Nevada and filed for a divorce. Mr. Hearst followed her; the couple reconciled and returned to New York. Five months later, Mrs. Hearst again traveled to Las Vegas and was granted a divorce. In May 1932, she married Mr. Paley in Kingman, Ariz.         ''Although seven years his junior, Dorothy was more worldly than he,'' Sally Bedell Smith wrote in ''In All His Glory,'' her 1990 biography of Mr. Paley. ''She knew her way around in sophisticated circles; friendships with men like Randolph Churchill counted a great deal to the ambitious Paley. In New York, she joined the Algonquin set -- the playwrights, journalists and other intellectuals whose luncheon ripostes during the 1920's became a literary legend.''         Over the years, Mrs. Smith wrote, Mr. Paley's wife had an impact on him -- ''her political leanings, appetite for news, taste in art and sense of style. She supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and embraced his proposals for social welfare.''         David Patrick Columbia wrote in Quest magazine in 1993: ''They were the golden couple on the town. She became his Pygmalion. His hunger to know satisfied her trenchant desire to teach. He had the instincts, but she, despite her youth, had the instincts and the knowledge. She began transforming his life. She got him to Savile Row tailors. She encouraged him to buy art and introduced him to dealers. In a short time they began to accumulate what is now known as the William Paley Collection. At her suggestion, they pursued the thoroughly modern path of psychoanalysis.''         She was sketched by Matisse, photographed by Cecil Beaton and Horst, listed as one of the world's best-dressed women and featured in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. She decorated Kiluna Farm, their 85-acre estate in Manhasset, with a saltwater pool and an indoor tennis court, lining the walls with their growing collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. Twenty-two servants looked after the house, gardens and greenhouse.         The Paleys separated in 1945, shortly after Mr. Paley returned from wartime service in London. Mrs. Smith observed in her book that Mr. Paley's ''peccadillos weren't the only symptom of trouble ahead.''         ''To those with a sharp eye, other hairline cracks were showing in the marriage,'' Mrs. Smith wrote. ''When Dorothy corrected him in public, she was brisk and impatient, not gentle.''         They were divorced in 1947, and she received some paintings, furniture, silver and $1.5 million.         ''I never behaved as if the world revolved around him,'' Mrs. Hirshon once recalled about her marriage to Mr. Paley. ''Maybe that was a problem.''         Dorothy Hart was born in Los Angeles on Feb. 25, 1908, the only child of Seth Hart, an insurance broker, and the former Dorothy Jones. While she was in elementary school, the family moved to Dayton, Ohio, for three years. Upon their return to Los Angeles, she attended Marlboro, an exclusive girls' school. She later spent a year at Bennett Junior College in Millbrook, N.Y., and furthered her lifelong interest in art by taking several art history courses.         Although she participated in a number of social projects throughout her life, raising money to build a nursery school in Harlem, for instance, and serving as a guidance counselor at the Downtown Community School in the 1940's, she became more involved in philanthropic and community activities in the last 40 years.         She worked with the Neighborhood Children's Center for more than two decades, was a member of the New York City Human Rights Commission, served on the Hospitality Committee of the United Nations in the 1960's, and became a board member of the Vivian Beaumont Theater, a board member of Lincoln Center in the 1980's and a trustee of Carnegie Hall. She was also on the board of Phoenix House and was a trustee of the New School for Social Research until her death.         She is survived by a son, Jeffrey Paley of Manhattan; a daughter, Hilary Paley Califano of Roxbury, Conn., and Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Joy H. Briggs of Manhattan, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Rene  de Epelbaum, a founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo human rights group and one of its most dynamic members, died on Saturday at age 77.         Her colleagues said she had suffered a heart attack.         In 1977, during its crackdown on leftists, the military dictatorship that ran Argentina at the time abducted her three adult children, Luis, Lila, and Claudio, and presumably killed them. Mrs. Epelbaum offered her home as a meeting place for mothers who had suffered the same plight.         Soon after, in open defiance of the junta, the group of mothers began holding weekly protests in the main Government square, the Plaza de Mayo. Today, the protests at the Plaza de Mayo are still held every Thursday as the elderly mothers don their trademark white head scarfs with the names of missing children scrawled in ink.         A Government commission found in the mid-1980's that at least 9,000 people had been killed or disappeared during the right-wing military Government's crackdown on political opponents. Human rights advocates contend that the number of victims was closer to 30,000.         Mrs. Epelbaum, who once taught literature, was a fearless, outspoken critic of the military Government. Her writings, speeches, and trips abroad helped earn the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo international acclaim. She also is credited with bringing worldwide attention to the atrocities of Argentina's military regime, which reliquinshed power in 1983.         ''I remember the first time she gave a press conference in Canada and spoke against the dictatorship,'' said Laura Bonaparte, another member of her group. ''They told her to be careful because she could be killed when she returned to Argentina. Epelbaum replied: 'What is important to me is what we do today, not what will happen tommorrow.' ''         Mrs. Epelbaum was greatly troubled by President Carlos Saul Menem's decision in 1989 to pardon senior military officers accused of human rights abuses. The democratically elected Government said the move was essential for national reconciliation.         ''It is a true moral aberration that leaves in liberty those who violated human dignity and those who rose up against the constitutional order,'' Mrs. Epelbaum said.         Alfredo Bravo, an opposition Congressman whose party has proposed a bill to rescind the military amnesty, said of Mrs. Epelbaum, who leaves no immediate survivors, ''It hurts me deeply that as a Congressman, I have not been able to repair her pain, at least in part, with the abolition of these amnesty decrees.''       
         Bella S. Abzug, New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist, politician and lawyer, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77.         She died of complications following heart surgery, said Harold Holzer, who was her spokesman when she served in Congress. She had been hospitalized for weeks, and had been in poor health for several years, he said.         Ms. Abzug represented the West Side of Manhattan for three Congressional terms in the 1970's. She  brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character. Often called just Bella, she was recognizable everywhere by her big hats and a voice that Norman Mailer said ''could boil the fat off a taxicab driver's neck.''         She opposed the Vietnam War, championed what was then called women's liberation and was one of the first to call for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. Long after it ceased to be fashionable, she called her politics radical. During her last campaign, for Congress in 1986, she told The New York Times, ''I am not a centrist.''         Bella Abzug was a founding feminist, and an enduring one. In the movement's giddy, sloganeering early days, Ms. Abzug was, like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, an icon, the hat bobbing before the cameras at marches and rallies.         After leaving the House in January 1977, she worked for women's rights for two more decades. She founded an international women's group that worked on environmental issues. And she was a leader of a conference of nongovernmental organizations that paralleled the United Nations' fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.         Even then, she continued to rankle.  Former President George Bush, on a private visit to China that coincided with the Beijing conference, said to a meeting of food production executives: ''I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around. Bella Abzug is one who has always represented the extremes of the women's movement.''         When told of Mr. Bush's remark, Ms. Abzug, 75 and in a wheelchair, retorted: ''He was addressing a fertilizer group? That's appropriate.''         Her forceful personality and direct manner made her a lightning rod for criticism from those who opposed the idea of holding a women's conference. After Bob Dole, then the Senate majority leader, said he could not imagine why anyone ''would want to attend a conference co-chaired by Bella Abzug,'' she responded that she was not running the meeting but simply participating with more than 30,000 other women over how best to achieve equal rights.         But much of what Ms. Abzug agitated for -- abortion rights, day care, laws against employment discrimination -- was by that time mainstream political fare.         In Congress, ''she was first on almost everything, on everything that ever mattered,'' said Esther Newberg, Ms. Abzug's first administrative assistant and one of many staff members who quit but remained devoted. ''She was first to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, first to call for an end to the war.''         Ms. Abzug made enemies easily -- ''Sometimes the hat and the mouth took over,'' Ms. Newberg said -- but Ms. Abzug saw that as a consequence of a refusal to compromise, as well as a matter of sport. Of her time in the House, Ms. Abzug wrote in a journal that was published in 1972 as ''Bella,'' ''I spend all day figuring out how to beat the machine and knock the crap out of the political power structure.''         She worked relentlessly at organizing and coalition-building. A founder of Women Strike for Peace and the National Women's Political Caucus, she spent a lifetime prodding for change, with a lawyer's enthusiasm for political channels, through organizations from the P.T.A. to the United Nations.         She made friends easily, too. ''She's fierce and intense and funny,'' said her longtime friend Gloria Steinem. ''She takes everyone seriously. When she argues with you fiercely, it's because she takes you seriously. And she's willing to change her mind. That's so rare.''         Her First Speech, In a Subway Station         Bella Savitzky Abzug was born on July 24, 1920 in the Bronx, the second daughter of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father, Emanuel Savitzky, whom Ms. Abzug later described as ''this humanist butcher,'' ran (and named) the Live and Let Live Meat Market on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan.         She said she knew from the age of 11 that she wanted to be a lawyer, and not long afterward gave her first public speech, in a subway station, while collecting for a Zionist youth organization. She went from Hunter College, where she was student body president, to Columbia University Law School, where she was an editor of The Law Review, to a practice representing union workers.         Ms. Abzug traced the wearing of her trademark wide-brimmed hats to those days. She once recalled: ''When I was a young lawyer, I would go to people's offices and they would always say: 'Sit here. We'll wait for the lawyer.' Working women wore hats. It was the only way they would take you seriously.         ''After a while, I started liking them. When I got to Congress, they made a big thing of it. So I was watching. Did they want me to wear it or not? They didn't want me to wear it, so I did.''         All the while, she was a leftist and an agitator. Later, exasperated with her Congressional aides, she wrote: ''I just don't understand young people today, quite frankly. Our struggle was political, ideological and economic, and we felt we couldn't make something of ourselves unless we bettered society. We saw the two together.''         In the 1950's, Ms. Abzug's law practice turned to other cases identified with the left. One client was Willie McGee, a black Mississippian convicted of raping a white woman and sentenced to death. Ms. Abzug, who was pregnant at the time, argued the case in Mississippi while white supremacist groups threatened her. Though the Supreme Court stayed the execution twice, Mr. McGee was eventually executed.         She also represented people accused of Communist activities by Senator Joseph McCarthy's Congressional committee and its counterpart in Albany.         In the 1960's, Ms. Abzug became an antiwar activist. A founder of Women Strike for Peace, she became its chief lobbyist, protesting nuclear testing and, later, the Vietnam War. She organized insurgent Democrats into other groups, too, becoming a leader of the movement against President Lyndon B. Johnson and a prominent figure in the 1968 Presidential campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy.         During those years, Ms. Abzug started navigating New York City politics. She and her husband, Martin, moved from Mount Vernon, the Westchester suburb where they had raised their two daughters, to a town house at 37 Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In 1970, Ms. Abzug ran for Congress.         The 19th Congressional District, which snaked from lower Manhattan  to the West 80's, had four registered Democrats to every Republican and had been represented in Congress for seven terms by Leonard Farbstein, a  solid but rather somnolent liberal. Ms. Abzug won the Democratic primary with 54 percent of the vote.         Campaign Became A Women's Crusade         At this point, Bella Abzug became national news, a flash of local color in a political year. She seemed to be everywhere, clapping backs and jabbing biceps. Her campaign headquarters next to the Lion's Head, a writers' and journalists' bar in Greenwich Village, was also a day-care center for her legions of female volunteers. The women's crusade she led brought considerable, if sometimes derisive, attention.         Though she eventually took 55 percent of the vote, she had genuine Republican opposition, unusual in an era when New York's main political action consisted of various Democratic factions knifing one another. The Republican-Liberal candidate was Barry Farber, a well-known radio talk show host. Mr. Farber drew many Democrats who resented Mr. Farbstein's humiliation or were simply put off by Ms. Abzug's style.         To her chagrin, Mr. Farber accused Ms. Abzug, who advocated direct negotiations between Israelis and Arabs, of flagging in her support of Israel. For years after that, she made a point of stating her Jewish credentials, dating to childhood: her family was religious and she went regularly to synagogue (though she was bothered that women were relegated to the back rows of the balcony), studied Hebrew and was enrolled for a time at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         When Ms. Abzug went to Washington, she sought an appointment to the Armed Services Committee. She wanted a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam and she vowed to take on the military-industrial complex. She wanted to end the draft. She wanted national health insurance, money for  day-care centers and housing, and more money for New York City, all to be paid for with billions siphoned from the Pentagon's budget.         She got little of this, but during the next six years ''she was indefatigable,'' Ms. Newberg recalled. ''She yelled a lot,only because she couldn't get everything done.'' And if she couldn't, Ms. Newberg added, it was partly because ''her agenda was too pure for her moment in time.''         Ms. Abzug did become expert at parliamentary rules, worked them skillfully and was famously well prepared for every vote, hearing and committee spat. The ''sunshine law'' requiring governing bodies to meet publicly came out of a subcommittee she headed. She coaxed funds for New York from the Public Works Committee. She was a co-sponsor of  the women's equal rights amendment. ''She was one of the most exciting, enlightened legislators that ever served in the Congress,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, with whom Ms. Abzug sometimes collaborated and sometimes sparred.         From her first day on Capitol Hill -- the day she dismayed her colleagues by introducing her Vietnam resolution -- Ms. Abzug derided the Congressional club, the seniority system, the log-rolling and back-scratching. She did not spare fellow Democrats; when she spoke of liberals, it was usually dismissively. She badgered the House leadership over committee appointments and votes.         She badgered the President, too. Invited to a reception at Richard Nixon's White House, she accepted (while writing in her journal, ''Who wants to listen to his pious idiocies?''), then announced to Nixon in the receiving line that her constituents demanded a withdrawal from Vietnam.         For all of her railing against Democrats who went along to get along,  Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill named her one of his dozen assistant whips, and by most accounts she worked well with some of the crustiest fixtures in the House.         Still, a 1972 report by Ralph Nader  estimated that Ms. Abzug's sponsorship of a measure often cost it 20 to 30 votes. Her reputation as an irritant came from all quarters. Jimmy Breslin wrote of a campaign worker who repaired to the Lion's Head one night, holding his side and swearing never to work for Ms. Abzug again. ''She punched me,'' he explained, in a quarrel over scheduling. The next day, Mr. Breslin reported, Ms. Abzug called the aide. ''Michael, I called to apologize,'' she said. ''How's your kidney?''         Mr. Breslin also recounted the Congresswoman's introduction to Sol Linowitz, the former chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a Democratic Party luminary: ''Are you the man that used to be head of the Xerox?'' Ms. Abzug asked. ''That's right,'' Mr. Linowitz replied. ''I'm glad to meet a big shot,'' Ms. Abzug said. ''I'm in hock $35,000 on my campaign.''         Ms. Abzug acknowledged loneliness in her years in Congress. ''Outside of Martin and the kids, I don't feel very related to most people at this point,'' she wrote in 1971. ''I feel detached in social situations. I'm always thinking about other things, about Congress, about the issues, about the political coalition I'm trying to organize. It never leaves me. I even have trouble relating to some of my closest friends, though God knows I still love them, even if they don't know it.''         Always, she returned to Manhattan to spend weekends with her husband.         She had married Martin Abzug in 1944. The two New Yorkers met on a bus in Miami, when both were on the way to a Yehudi Menuhin concert. Mr. Abzug, a stockbroker and an author of two published novels, had next to no interest in politics. In an interview in 1970, he murmured, while his wife was out of the room, ''The political bug is a curious bug.'' But he was, she said, her best friend and supporter, and ''one of the few unneurotic people left in society.''         Corrosive Ambition Hampers a Career         Ms. Abzug's own ambition was too corrosive for many people, even -- or, perhaps, especially -- for her fellow New York Democrats. When the State Legislature sliced up her district in 1972, they urged her to challenge one of the two conservative incumbent Democrats in adjoining districts, Representative John J. Rooney or Representative John M. Murphy. Instead, she opposed a liberal Democrat, William Fitts Ryan, in the 20th District, encompassing the Upper West Side and the Riverdale section of the Bronx.         The primary was bitter and, eventually, politically expensive to Ms. Abzug. Bill Ryan was one of the earliest heroes of the city's insurgent Democrats, an early opponent of the  Vietnam War and a genuinely well-liked man who, as many of his constituents knew, was waging a gallant fight against cancer.         Mr. Ryan defeated Ms. Abzug in the Democratic primary but died before the general election. The Democratic County Committee appointed Ms. Abzug as the candidate to replace him, but she was challenged by Mr. Ryan's widow, Priscilla, who ran on the Liberal line. Ms. Abzug won in November, but she had made dedicated enemies who believed she was an overly aggressive politician who would not hesitate to attack anyone who got in her way. Ten years later, she was denied a seat in the state's delegation to the national party's biannual conference because New York leaders considered her disruptive.         In 1976, she gave up her House seat to run for the Senate. She lost in the primary, to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, by a margin of only 1 percent. Two more campaigns quickly followed. (In a 1978 interview, she said: ''I'm a politician. I run for office. That's my profession.'') She lost to Edward I. Koch in a crowded mayoral primary in 1977. The next year, running for the House again, she lost, again by just 1 percent, to a little-known Republican, S. William Green.         She was appointed co-chairwoman  of President Jimmy Carter's National Advisory Committee on Women, and then, after disagreeing with him over economic policy, was dismissed. The majority of the committee members resigned in protest. Ms. Abzug, unapologetic, said with a shrug, ''I've got to find myself another big, nonpaying job.''         Her next and last campaign was in 1986, this time for a House seat in Westchester County. She won the primary in a burst of the old, ebullient campaigning style, but lost in November to Joseph J. DioGuardi, the Republican incumbent.         It was during that campaign that Martin Abzug died. Her friends said Ms. Abzug never recovered. Nine years later, she said, , ''I haven't been entirely the same since.''         There was one more bid for office, for her old House seat on the Upper West Side, when she announced her candidacy to replace Representative Ted Weiss on his death just before the 1992 election. But she was quickly eliminated from the field at the party convention.         During the next decade, Ms. Abzug suffered from ill health, including breast cancer, but continued to practice law and work for women's groups. She wrote a book, ''Gender Gap,'' with her old friend Mim Kelber. She started a lobbying group called Women U.S.A. and founded the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a group that works with international agencies.         In addition to her daughters, Eve and Liz, Ms. Abzug is survived by her sister, Helene Alexander of Great Neck, N.Y.         ''I've been described as a tough and noisy woman, a prizefighter, a man hater, you name it,'' Ms. Abzug said of herself in ''Bella.'' ''They call me Battling Bella, Mother Courage and a Jewish mother with more complaints than Portnoy.''         ''There are those who say I'm impatient, impetuous, uppity, rude, profane, brash and overbearing. Whether I'm any of these things or all of them, you can decide for yourself. But whatever I am -- and this ought to be made very clear at the outset -- I am a very serious woman.''       
         Baroness Lestor of Eccles, a crusading British politician who spoke out against apartheid in defiance of her Government's policies and who struck a blow on behalf of single mothers when she won the right to adopt two children on her own, died in a hospice in London on Friday. She was 66 and had been suffering from motor neurone disease.         Lady Lestor had two great causes in her life: the fight against racism and the fight for the rights of children, and was never afraid to criticize her party when she disagreed with its policies.         She was briefly chairman of the Labor Party in 1977-78 and served as a junior minister in several Labor Governments in the early 1970's, but was perhaps too uncompromising in her beliefs to rise to a higher office. She was, an admirer once said, ''the heart and soul of the Labor Party.''         Joan Lestor was born on Nov. 13, 1931, in Vancouver, British Columbia, to parents steeped in the international labor movement. Her mother, Esther, had been a machinist in a textile factory in East London who, as a teen-ager, became a shop steward for the garment workers' union; her father, Charles, a journalist and actor, was a leading member of the Canadian Socialist Party and later, when the family returned to England, of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.         Ms. Lestor graduated from London University with a diploma in sociology and went to work as a nursery school teacher, opening a nursery school in her own home six years later. At the same time she pursued a career in politics. Disillusioned by what she considered the extremism of her father's party, she joined Labor at the age of 24, won several local elections and was elected to Parliament in 1966. She remained there, with a four-year break, until 1997.         She immediately threw herself into the issues that consumed her, introducing a bill to tighten regulations on nursery schools and providers of child care; fighting the Government's attempt to stop paying social security benefits to unwed mothers, and working to insure that abandoned wives could obtain financial support from their husbands.         She was passionate about the rights of abused children, saying in a 1989 debate that while it was necessary to ''strike a balance'' between the rights of children and the rest of the family, ''in my book, the rights of the children are paramount.''         Her jobs in the Labor Governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan often became jeopardized by the rigor of her principles. In 1974, when she was appointed a junior minister in the Foreign Office with special responsibility for African affairs, she earned the nickname ''the African Queen'' and repeatedly clashed with her superiors over her strong anti-apartheid views.         Ms. Lestor was then moved to a ministerial job in the Education Department. But she resigned after a year in protest over spending cuts that threatened the jobs of thousands of teachers and forced the postponement of her goal to change the age when students left state-financed secondary schools to 16, from 15.         With the Conservatives in power through the 1980's and into the 1990's, Ms. Lestor worked as the opposition's chief spokeswoman on a number of issues, including children and the family, juvenile crime and race relations. She resigned from her last opposition post, as spokeswoman for overseas development, in 1996, saying that she was too ill to continue.         In 1997 she was made a Baroness and elevated to the House of Lords.         A flamboyant, warmhearted woman who listed her hobbies in Who's Who as ''playing with children and animals,'' Lady Lestor relished adversarial politics and was not shy about telling people what she thought, in the plainest possible language.         When she heard that Rupert Allason, a fellow Member of Parliament and an espionage expert, was about to accuse her publicly of spying for the K.G.B., she confronted him and showered him with invective. ''Perhaps I used words no lady should,'' she conceded later.         She was married briefly as a teen-ager in 1948, but the marriage was dissolved and she never remarried. She wanted children, nonetheless, and fought for the right to adopt them herself, despite being single.         When she won her case, she cried with happiness, and went on to adopt her son, David, in 1967, and her daughter, Susan, in 1969. She loved being a grandmother, and caused roars of laughter in Parliament when she announced, in a wicked nod at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who had grandly used the royal ''we'' in noting the birth of her first grandchild, that ''we too became a grandmother.''         When she received her peerage, she said she celebrated by baking muffins for her grandchildren; having them, she said, was ''even better than being in love.''       
         Linda Eastman McCartney, the wife of the former Beatle Paul McCartney and a photographer whose portraits of 1960's rock stars have become classics, died on Friday in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the McCartneys were vacationing. She was 56.         The cause was breast cancer that spread to her liver, said Geoff Baker, a family spokesman.         Besides her work as a photographer, Ms. McCartney performed as a keyboardist and backup singer in two of her husband's post-Beatles bands, Wings and the unnamed ensemble that toured in 1989 and 1993. She was a staunch campaigner for animal rights and vegetarianism and, starting in the late 1980's, she turned her passion for vegetarian cooking into an industry. She published two cookbooks, ''Linda McCartney's Home Cooking'' in 1989 and ''Linda's Kitchen'' in 1996, and in 1991 started a line of frozen vegetarian dinners.         As the wife of a musician who had long been a teen-age heartthrob and was the last Beatle to be married,  Ms. McCartney first attracted the ire of her husband's fans, and eventually the respect of many of them. When the McCartneys were married in London on March 12, 1969, hundreds of crying girls packed the sidewalk outside the Marylebone Register Office. Later, when she toured with Mr. McCartney, she took considerable criticism for her modest keyboard and vocal technique.         But the McCartneys' 29-year marriage was uncommonly steady by the standards of the celebrity world of which they were a part but from which they generally remained aloof, spending most of their time on a farm in West Sussex, England. They  never spent a night apart, except for the 10 days Mr. McCartney spent in a Tokyo jail after he was arrested for marijuana possession; indeed, their disinclination to be separated was part of Mr. McCartney's reason for having his wife in his touring band.         And Mr. McCartney, the composer of some of the rock era's most beautiful love songs, has consistently told interviewers that all his romantic  ballads written after 1968 were about Linda. Those songs include everything from ''Maybe I'm Amazed'' and ''The Lovely Linda'' on his first post-Beatles album, ''McCartney'' (1970), ''Long-Haired Lady'' on ''Ram'' (1971) and ''My Love'' on ''Red Rose Speedway'' (1973) to more recent songs like ''We Got Married'' and ''Figure of Eight'' on ''Flowers in the Dirt'' (1989) and ''Somedays'' on ''Flaming Pie'' (1997), his most recent studio album.         Mr. McCartney was not the first to compose a song about Ms. McCartney. Her father, Lee Eastman, was a prominent show business lawyer in New York and one of his clients, Jack Lawrence, wrote ''Linda'' for her in 1947 when she was 6. Buddy Clark had a hit with the song that year, and it was later recorded by Perry Como and Jan and Dean.         Ms. McCartney also wrote a few songs, including the reggae-style ''Seaside Woman,'' which she and Mr. McCartney released as a single in 1977 under the name Suzy and the Red Stripes, and ''The White-Coated Man,'' which she wrote with Carla Lane and released (also as Suzy and the Red Stripes) on an animal-rights charity disk, ''Animal Magnetism,'' in 1994.         She was born Linda Louise Eastman on September 24, 1941, and grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. As she often pointed out, without ever dispelling the assertion entirely, she was not related to the Eastmans of the Eastman-Kodak photography empire. In fact, her father had changed his name from Epstein.         She described growing up in artistic and materialistic surroundings, with a status-conscious mother and a father whose friends and clients included the artist Willem de Kooning and the songwriters Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Arlen.         Ms. McCartney attended Sarah Lawrence College and the University of Arizona. While a student in Arizona, she married and had a daughter, but the marriage ended in 1963.         Soon afterward, she took up photography, and in 1965 she returned to New York, where she began photographing rock groups, starting with the Dave Clark Five and the Rolling Stones. During the next few years she befriended and photographed dozens of rock stars, including Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, the Animals, Janis Joplin, the Mamas and the Papas, Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa, the Beach Boys and the Grateful Dead. A widely reproduced picture of the Beatles that she took at a press party for the release of ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' in 1967 captured the group on the eve of its greatest artistic triumph.         Her photographs appeared in Rolling Stone and other rock magazines, and in 1992 she published several hundred of them as a book, ''Linda McCartney's Sixties: Portrait of an Era.''         Ms. McCartney met her future husband while photographing the Beatles in London in 1967, and the pair carried on an occasional romance for more than a year. In September 1968, Mr. McCartney asked her to move to London, from which point they became inseparable. Although she took some stunning pictures of the Beatles at work, she left most of them unpublished until she assembled her ''Sixties'' book. Her photographs of Mr. McCartney, however, adorned some of his post-Beatles album covers, and in one of his early television specials, ''James Paul McCartney,'' he is shown singing a medley of his songs while his wife did a photo shoot.         In addition to Mr. McCartney and the daughter from her first marriage, Heather, Ms. McCartney is survived by three children from her marriage with Mr. McCartney: Mary, Stella and James; and by her brother John, who is now Mr. McCartney's lawyer and business manager, and two sisters, Laura and Louise.         Besides ''Sixties,'' Ms. McCartney published several other books, including ''Linda's Pictures,'' ''Sun Prints,'' ''Photographs'' and ''Road Works.'' Celebrities were by no means her only photographic subject. Plants, animals, natural patterns on rock faces and people she encountered on her travels engaged her interest and were captured with a touching refinement in many of her pictures. Her work has also been the subject of exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Royal Photographic Society in Bath, England, and at more than 50 galleries around the world.         Correction:  April 21, 1998, Tuesday  The obituary of the photographer Linda McCartney yesterday gave an incorrect name in some copies for the most recent studio album by her husband, the former Beatle Paul McCartney. It is ''Flaming Pie''; ''Off the Ground'' was the one before that.         Correction:  June 11, 1998, Thursday  The obituary of Linda McCartney on April 20 misstated her college background. She attended only the University of Arizona, not Sarah Lawrence College as well. The obituary also misstated the given name of her first husband in some copies. He was Melvin See, not Bob. The errors were pointed out in E-mail received from a reader yesterday.       
         Wendy O. Williams, the leader of the 1980's punk band the Plasmatics, a group more famous for their destructive onstage antics than for their music, died on Monday at her home in Storrs, Conn., in what officials called a suicide. She was 48.         The cause was a gunshot wound to the head, said a spokeswoman for the state's Chief Medical Examiner, who said that she had committed suicide.         Born in Rochester to an Eastman Kodak chemist and his wife, Ms. Williams got her first taste of fame tap-dancing on the ''Howdy Doody Show'' at age 6 and had her first but not last run-in with the law at age 15 when she was arrested for sunbathing nude. She left high school soon after and hitchhiked to Colorado and later Florida, making money selling crafts and working as a lifeguard. She drifted through Europe, bartending, dancing and getting arrested for shoplifting and passing counterfeit money. In 1976 she landed in Manhattan as a performer at Captain Kink's Sex Fantasy Theater, where she met Rod Swenson, a Yale graduate who ran the sex shows there.         Mr. Swenson became her manager in 1978 and helped her put together the Plasmatics, which made its debut at CBGB's, the punk and New Wave mecca of the time. The group's music was loud, heavy guitar-driven rock, which transformed from noise to heavy metal as the years wore on, all with Ms. Williams singing, rasping and ranting on top.         It was the band's performances, however, that brought it to national attention. Ms. Williams, with a striking blond mohawk and wearing a nurse's uniform, electrical tape or just shaving cream would attack guitars with chainsaws, fire shotguns at amplifiers and destroy television sets with sledgehammers. At one performance, she leapt out of a Cadillac moments before it exploded and plunged into the Hudson River. On Tom Snyder's ''Tomorrow,'' she blew up another automobile, and in videos she leapt from moving cars to airplanes and crashed a school bus into a wall of television sets.         After the release of the first of four Plasmatics albums, ''New Hope for the Wretched,'' on Stiff Records in 1981, Ms. Williams became a First Amendment cause celebre when she was arrested in Milwaukee and later in Cleveland on obscenity charges involving lewd gestures made with a sledgehammer and a microphone. (The charges didn't stick.) In 1985 she was nominated for a Grammy Award for best female rock vocal.         As Plasmatics members drifted into other bands, Ms. Williams recorded solo albums, put together various incarnations of the Plasmatics and starred in film comedies like ''Reform School Girls'' and ''Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog.'' Despite her image, friends described Ms. Williams as a warm, ascetic and somewhat shy vegetarian who demanded sprouts and tofu backstage, spent 12 hours a week working out and contributed to animal rights causes. Ms. Williams moved with Mr. Swenson to Connecticut in 1991, where she worked with animals.         She is survived by her mother and two sisters.       
         Belle Zeller, an emeritus professor of political science at Brooklyn College and a scholar of the legislative process who was an indomitable leader of unions representing City University of New York professors for more than 30 years, died on Friday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 95.         Dr. Zeller, who at 83 survived an accident in which she was struck by a bus and critically injured, died in her sleep, said her niece, Laura Glass.         From 1944 until 1972, Dr. Zeller was the chairwoman of the Legislative Conference of the City Colleges, a lobbying group that later became the first union to represent the permanent faculty in the City University system. In 1972, the conference merged with the United Federation of College Teachers, a rival union representing part-time instructors. For the next four years, Dr. Zeller was president of the joint group, the Professional Staff Congress.         As a labor advocate for the professors, Dr. Zeller lobbied for legislation to establish tenure and pensions that today are considered some of the basic rights of public college teachers in New York State. She used her academic expertise in the legislative process to champion the rights of faculty members, becoming a familiar figure at City Hall and the State Capitol.         ''When it came to representing the faculty, she was irrepressible,'' said Irwin H. Polishook, who has been president of Professional Staff Congress since Dr. Zeller retired in 1976. ''She would burst in on legislators who were busy with other business, even if they were behind closed doors, even if they were in conference. Because of who she was, people accepted that. She was able to get people's attention because she was a scholar as well as an activist.''         Belle Zeller was born in New York City on April 8, 1903. She was one of nine children of a couple who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to New York, where her father worked in a shoe factory. Her parents and older siblings often discussed politics around the dinner table and she became fascinated by government at an early age.         She attended Hunter College High School and Hunter College, where she specialized in history and the social sciences, earning a B.A. in 1924 and an M.A. in 1926. She was one of the system's few female professors when she began teaching at Hunter College's Brooklyn campus in 1927. She remained there when it changed its name to Brooklyn College in 1930, becoming one of the institution's founding instructors.         In 1937, she received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University.         Her doctoral dissertation, ''Pressure Politics in New York'' (Prentice Hall, 1937) was one of the first major studies of lobbying in New York State politics and it was reprinted in 1967. She was later recognized nationwide as an authority on lobbying and served as an adviser to Senator John F. Kennedy and other legislators who were revising the Federal Lobbying Registration Act.         Throughout her long career, Dr. Zeller was the recipient of numerous academic awards, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the Graduate School of City University in 1985 and the President's Medal from Brooklyn College on the institution's 50th anniversary in 1980.         Dr. Zeller never married. In addition to Ms. Glass, she is survived by four other nieces and a nephew.       
         Mary Bancroft Boulton, a psychotherapist who helped introduce to New York City the practice of transactional analysis, which tries to help a patient correct self-destructive behavior patterns in relationships with other people, died at her home in Greenwich Village on May 30. She was 86.         Transactional analysis became popular after Dr. Eric Berne published ''Games People Play'' in 1964 (reissued in paperback by Ballantine Books in 1996). Dr. Boulton studied with Dr. Berne in San Francisco, then brought the new therapy to New York in 1966 when she founded the New York Transactional Analysis Seminar with Dr. Marian Weisberg and Dr. Barbara Rosenfeld.         Transactional analysis, often done in group therapy, delves into the multiple roles each person plays, as a child or parent, for example. One of Dr. Boulton's sons, John Bancroft, said, ''She would often say to me, 'Well, that's your child speaking,' or, 'That's your parent speaking.' ''         Dr. Boulton was also concerned with the roles thrust upon her patients, particularly women, by society.         In one article, she said patients not only needed to escape from the smothering influence of demanding parents but also needed to defy ''the 'big guns' of our culture -- traditional religious teaching, educational practice, literature, television, and the toys and games which are prescribed for boys and girls.''         The New York seminar, modeled after one run by Dr. Berne, was open to any psychotherapists who wanted to learn the new therapy, Dr. Weisberg said.         The seminar met until 1973, when Dr. Boulton and Dr. Weisberg opened the Gotham Institute for Transactional Analysis, a training institute that closed in 1978. Dr. Boulton continued her private practice until she retired in 1990.         Dr. Boulton was born Mary Elizabeth Holzman in Cincinnati on Aug. 9, 1911. She received a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Cincinnati in 1932 and a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania in 1935. She received her Ph.D. in 1980 from Northern Indiana University.         She married Frank Bancroft in 1935, and they were both active in left-wing causes.         Mr. Bancroft died in 1959. Dr. Boulton married John Wallace in 1962; the marriage ended in divorce.         Dr. Boulton married Schroeder Boulton in 1965, and their home in Greenwich Village became a gathering spot for people in civil rights and antiwar work, Mr. Bancroft said.         Dr. Boulton is survived by her husband; three sons, Carter Bancroft, of Huntington, N.Y., and Michael and John Bancroft, both of Seattle; three stepdaughters, Janet Boulton, of New York, Nancy Boulton, of Lincoln, Mass., and Tiffany Wallace, of Lexington, Ky., and seven grandchildren.       
         Julia Perles, a longtime Manhattan lawyer who played an important part in bringing about a significant change in New York State's divorce legislation, died early Wednesday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla. She was 84 and had lived in Sarasota for about four years.         The cause was not immediately clear, but she had had a fall at her home, said Janet Post, a friend.         Ms. Perles is widely considered to have played the leading role in bringing about the passage of what is popularly known as New York State's equitable distribution law, which went into effect in 1980. The law brought about what its admirers have called a revolutionary change in the practice of matrimonial law and in the rights of marital partners.         At her death, Ms. Perles was still affiliated with the law firm of Phillips, Nizer, Benjamin, Krim & Ballon, based in Manhattan, where she became a partner in 1970, having been invited by Louis Nizer to head the firm's matrimonial practice.         She went on to become a senior partner until about eight years ago,  and remained head of her department until she moved to Florida. After that, she continued to be affiliated with the firm and its matrimonial department.         While she was practicing matrimonial law, she became chairwoman of a special committee of the New York County Lawyers Association. The panel's members were respected specialists in marital law who favored getting the equitable-distribution change made in the state law. Committee members communicated with the State Legislature in Albany repeatedly, former colleagues of Ms. Perles recalled, and it took much attention and perseverance to persuade the Legislature to make the change.         Under the law as it was passed in 1980, both spouses, in the event of a divorce, are enabled to share equitably in the assets that either or both of them have accumulated during the marriage, even if title to the property -- a house for instance, or a business -- is in the name of only one spouse. Parties to a marriage did not have that legal right in New York State before the law was passed.         The underlying assumption behind the law is that both parties to a marriage contribute to the acquisition, maintenance and growth of the marital assets.         Ms. Perles's clients over the years included Woody Allen; Nancy Allen, the actress-wife of Brian De Palma, the movie director; the former Eve Ella Sherpick Green, the first wife of Harry B. Helmsley, the New York real estate titan; David Merrick, the producer; and Ethel Scull, who once was called the doyenne of the pop art world.         Ms. Perles was a former president of the New York Women's Bar Association, a fellow of the American Academy of Matrimonial Lawyers and a member of the Dirty Thirty, an organization of American lawyers prominent in the field of matrimonial law.         She was born and raised in Brooklyn, and she wanted to be a lawyer from the time she was 12 years old. Rona J. Shays, a close friend, recalled that Ms. Perles used to say that her own mother had not wanted her to go to law school and had said to her, ''No one will want to marry you if they think you're smarter than they are.''         Nevertheless, Ms. Perles went on to attend Brooklyn College, and she received her law degree in 1937 from Brooklyn Law School.         She was an associate in the Manhattan law firm of Schwartz & Frohlich from 1942 to 1952 and then a partner at the Manhattan law firm of Greenbaum Wolff & Ernst before going to Phillips, Nizer.         In 1951 she married Howard Singer. He died in 1989.         Her survivors include a brother, David Perles, who lives in Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Betty Lehan Harragan, a writer, consultant and advocate for women's equality in the workplace, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was lung cancer, according to Kathleen Harragan, her daughter.         Betty Harragan's book ''Games Mother Never Taught You: Corporate Gamesmanship for Women'' was published in 1977 by Rawson Associates; since then, more than one million copies have been published in paperback by Warner Books. The book is used in college undergraduate courses and business schools and was the basis for a television film of the same name starring Loretta Swit and Sam Waterston, broadcast by CBS in 1982 and 1985.         Another book by Ms. Harragan, ''Knowing the Score: Play-by-Play Directions for Women on the Job,'' was published by St. Martin's Press in 1983. Ms. Harragan also wrote articles and columns about careers for such magazines as Working Woman, Woman's Day, Mademoiselle and Savvy.         A 27-year member of the National Organization for Women, for which she frequently handled publicity and public relations, Ms. Harragan often addressed professional societies and seminars for female managers. She also testified before legislative committees on behalf of equal opportunity, equal rights and comparable pay for women.         A native of Milwaukee, she graduated from Marquette University in there in 1944. She received a master's degree in English literature in 1947 from Columbia University.         From 1950 to 1956, she edited employee publications for the New York Telephone Company and was a writer and publicist at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency from 1963 to 1972. Later that year, Ms. Harragan started Betty Harragan & Affiliates, a consulting company that specialized in women's issues in the workplace.         Her husband, David J., died in 1962.         In addition to her daughter, Kathleen, of Boston, she is survived by three brothers, Robert Lehan of Tempe, Ariz.; Richard Lehan of Sacramento, Calif., and William Lehan of Anaheim, Calif.; two sisters, Geri Pollack of North Hills, Calif., and Judy Ascasio of Laguna Hills, Calif., and a grandson.       
         Dorothy West, ''the Kid'' of the  Harlem Renaissance circle of writers and artists in the 1920's who was rediscovered seven decades later when her novel ''The Wedding'' was published and became a best-seller,  died on Sunday night at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard.         Miss West, who began writing stories at age 7 in her family's elegant four-story house in Boston, was not yet 20 in 1926 when her short  story ''The Typewriter'' won a prize from the Urban League's Opportunity magazine. Encouraged, she  moved to Harlem and joined the poets, novelists, musicians and other artists forging a cultural renaissance there. Long before her death, she was frequently described as the last surviving member of that group.         ''We thought we were going to be the greatest writers in the world,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. 'We were all young and we fell in love with each other. We all had the same ambitions: writers and painters and so forth. We were free. . . .We had an innocence that nobody can have now.''         Langston Hughes gave Miss West the nickname ''the Kid'' and took her to Russia in 1932. She asked him to marry her but he declined. Soon she received a proposal from Countee Cullen, the poet who received one of the first Guggenheim Fellowships given to an African-American. She turned him down. She shared an apartment with Zora Neale Hurston, the writer and folklorist, and when guests came to the loft of Wallace Thurman, the novelist and editor, she was always there, sitting on the floor.  She had a bit part in the original stage production of ''Porgy and Bess.'' Claude McKay, already established as a poet and novelist, scolded her for not writing more.         ''We were a beautiful, young group,'' she told a Boston Globe interviewer in 1989. 'We drank too much, though. We drank too much.''         Miss West's first novel, ''The Living Is Easy,'' was not published until  1948, when the Harlem Renaissance had long faded. Her second, ''The  Wedding,'' about the aspirations and anxieties of black people living on Martha's Vineyard, appeared in 1995. Both were written at her family's former vacation home on the  Vineyard, where she had lived year-round since 1947 and was a columnist for The Vineyard Gazette.         At her celebrity-studded 90th birthday party on the island in 1997, which drew hundreds of well-wishers, she was called ''a national treasure'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton.         Miss West's stories and novels used brisk narratives, an eye for detail and wit to explore the aspirations of well-to-do blacks and the interplay of race, class and intraracial tensions in America. Her work was not overtly political, tending to more lyrical depictions of vanity, longing, love and misunderstanding.         ''Color is important, but class is more important,'' Miss West often said in the dozens of interviews she gave after ''The Wedding'' was published by Doubleday and made into a  miniseries by Oprah Winfrey.         Critics praised her storytelling and her pioneering descriptions of  conflict within the black middle class. ''There is an abundance of  psychological and historic richness to her characters,'' Elizabeth Benedict wrote in The Washington Post in 1995, ''and she can be wickedly eloquent about the costs of living in a world where the shadings in the color of one's skin are more important than the bonds between blood relatives.''         Miss West was born on June 2, 1907, in Boston, the only child of Isaac and Rachel West. Her father, born a slave, built a fruit and vegetable business that lifted the family into the slim ranks of Boston's black upper middle class. Her mother, a generation younger, ''spirited, fearless, sassy and smart,'' brought many of her 18 siblings and their families to live with them.         Family members ''ranged in color from the blond child to me,'' Miss  West wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' a collection of short stories and essays published in 1995. ''We were always stared at. . . . My mother prepared us. As she marched us down our front stairs, she would say what our smiles were on tiptoe to hear, 'Come on, children, let's go out and  drive the white folks crazy.'         ''She said it without rancor, and she said it in that outrageous way to  make us laugh. She was easing our entry into a world that outranked us  and outnumbered us. If she could not help us see ourselves with the humor,  however wry, that gives the heart its grace, she would never have forgiven  herself for letting our spirits be crushed before we had learned to  sheathe them with pride.''         The sisters and cousins defended  each other against outsiders, but at home squabbles were melodramatic, Miss West said. ''Surrounded by all these different personalities, each one wanting to be first among equals, I knew I wanted to be a writer.  Living with them was like living inside a story.''         Her work was first published when she was 14, in The Boston Post, and she soon became a regular contributor. After graduating from the Girls' Latin School at 16, she attended Boston University and the Columbia University School of Journalism.         In 1932, she and 20 other black Americans including Langston Hughes, were invited to visit the Soviet Union to work on a proposed movie about racism in America. The film was never made, but Miss West remained in the Soviet Union with Hughes for a year, returning to the United States only when she learned of her father's death.         There remains some question about whether she and Hughes were romantically involved, although she proposed to him in a letter in 1933. In a 1995 interview with The Boston Globe, she said that she never particularly wanted to marry -- ''Seemed like the man just became the woman's child'' -- but had wanted a child.  The memory of how she learned she could not was still painful decades later: the white doctor telling her briskly, ''There are already enough black people in the world.''         Miss West had no immediate survivors, although she remained close to many of her cousins.         In 1934, she founded Challenge, a quarterly magazine intended as a showcase for younger black writers and ''to recapture in the mid-30's the literary vitality of the Harlem Renaissance, which had not survived the Depression.'' Her subsequent magazine, New Challenge -- which reflected the belief of its associate editor, Richard Wright, that art is a weapon -- survived only briefly in 1937.         Miss West became a welfare investigator in Harlem (a job that was the source for several short stories)  and joined the Depression-era Federal Writers Project. In 1940, she began contributing two short stories a month at $50 apiece to The New York Daily News, an association she continued until 1960.         In the summer of 1947, she left New York for good, moving to Martha's Vineyard and the two-bedroom cedar-shingled cottage in Oak Bluffs that her father had bought. She lived there the rest of her life, once writing: ''I have lived in various places, but the island is my yearning place.  All my life, wherever I have been, abroad, New York, Boston, anywhere, whenever I yearned for home, I yearned for the island.''         ''The Living Is Easy'' was published the next year. In this semiautobiographical tale, the strong-willed, light-skinned Cleo Judson -- modeled on Miss West's mother -- tries to remake her darker-skinned  daughter, and breaks up her own  marriage to a former slave who had made himself ''the Black Banana King.'' The book satirizes upper-crust black Bostonians.         In the late 1940's, Miss West began writing columns for The Vineyard Gazette.. While caring for ailing relatives in the now-winterized cottage, she was also slowly writing another novel, published as ''The Wedding'' in 1995. (''The Richer, The Poorer,''  gathering 13 essays and 17 stories Miss West wrote between 1926 and 1987, came out later the same year.)         Starting in 1992, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, then a book editor for Doubleday, had visited the cottage once a week in the summers to work on the long-stalled novel with Miss  West. Mrs. Onassis died shortly before its publication, and Miss West dedicated it to her memory, writing,  ''Though there was never such a mismatched pair in appearance, we were perfect partners.''         Set in the black community on Martha's Vineyard during the 1950's, the novel is a gently ironic story of a beautiful, blond, privileged young black woman, Shelby Coles, who is torn about her planned marriage to a white jazz musician. Using flashbacks from the wedding day to many past generations, it delves into interracial and intraracial bigotry. Miss  West's belief in integration and her penchant for romance coalesced in the final line she gave Shelby Coles: ''Color was a false distinction; love  was not.''         Oprah Winfrey used the novel for a two-part miniseries this year. ''It shows a world that most people have rarely seen, a world where black  families are all highly educated, very successful, living in Martha's  Vineyard,'' Miss Winfrey said.         An energetic conversationalist and inveterate storyteller who was less than five feet tall, Miss West kept her distance from the political upheavals of her lifetime. She went to Communist Russia with Hughes and the others, she wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' because ''I liked them.'' In the 1960's and 70's, Miss West was not active in the civil rights movement and found radicals like the Black Panthers discomfiting.         ''I'm a creative writer,'' she said late in life. ''I'm not a black with a  chip on my shoulder.'' Instead, she often said: ''Color is nothing when you know people.''       
         Elizabeth Karlin, a Wisconsin doctor, advocate of women's rights and head of a clinic in Madison that was a target of abortion foes, died on July 27 at her home in nearby Arena. She was 54.         The cause was a brain tumor diagnosed a few months ago, her family said.         A native New Yorker, Dr. Karlin graduated from Bronx High School of Science and Antioch College. She received her medical degree at the University of Wisconsin and became an internist specializing in endocrinology.         She worked as a general practitioner in Tanzania before settling in Madison with a practice in internal medicine. She began to provide abortions in the 1980's even as more and more doctors refused to do so because of the actions of opponents.         Until her illness was diagnosed, she directed the Women's Medical Center on Madison's West Side. She was an outspoken champion of women's rights to self-determination.         ''I provide a full range of women's medical care and counseling to women who largely have no other access to health care,'' she wrote in a letter to the editor of The New York Times in 1995, ''yet I am forced to wear a bulletproof vest, to outwit my harassers and to hire security to protect my clinic and staff. My job is to offer nurturing medical care to the women who least expect kindness, excellence or even cleanliness.''         Such caring and respect, she concluded, would actually serve to decrease the number of abortions in the country in the long run.         Dr. Karlin is survived by her daughter, Jessica Feierman of Philadelphia; a son, Joshua Feierman of New York City; and her mother, Rosa Karlin of Madison. Her marriage to Steven Feierman of Philadelphia ended in divorce.       
         Minerva Bernardino, a major force behind the founding of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women and a pioneer among Latin American feminists, died on Aug. 29 in the Dominican Republic. She was 91.         Ms. Bernardino, who was appointed a representative of the Dominican Republic at the United Nations in 1950, was one of only four women to sign the United Nations Charter in 1945. At the Charter conference in San Francisco, she insisted that the document include the phrase ''to ensure respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms without discrimination against race, sex, condition or creed.''         A contemporary of Eleanor Roosevelt, whose passions for human rights she shared, Ms. Bernardino joined Mrs. Roosevelt and three other women who were delegates to the first United Nations General Assembly in 1946 -- Jean McKenzie of New Zealand, Evdokia Uralova of the Soviet Union and Ellen Wilkinson of Britain -- in writing an ''Open Letter to the Women of the World'' calling on women to take a more active role in politics and government.         She was vice chairman and then chairman of the Inter-American Commission on Women from 1944 to 1949, the first regional body set up to advance the rights of women.         ''Ms. Bernardino spoke up for women in the aftermath of World War II, understanding that life for women would never be the same, '' said Kristen Timothy, deputy director of the United Nations Division for the Advancement of Women.         Ms. Bernadino, born in Seibo in the Dominican Republic, was the granddaughter of a provincial governor and one of seven children in a family that was unusually liberal on women's rights.         ''My mother was very progressive and I was reared in an atmosphere that was, at that time, most unusual in my country,'' she once told The Christian Science Monitor in an interview. Her father also encouraged her independence.         When she was orphaned at 15, her lack of inhibitions about women working led her into a career in the civil service. Meanwhile, she was studying for a bachelor of science degree.         By 1929, she was active in the women's rights movement in the Dominican Republic, where she was a leader in Accion Feminista Dominicana, which led the fight for expanded rights in the 1942 Constitution.         In her long life of fighting for women's and children's rights, Ms. Bernardino won many honors. In 1995, she was awarded the Hispanic Heritage Award for excellence in education in Washington. On the 50th anniversary of the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women in 1997, she was honored in a speech by Secretary General Kofi Annan, who called the commission ''to an important extent her creation.''         Ms. Bernardino was also known in Latin American for her sustained opposition to strongmen -- she went into what friends described as self-imposed exile to demonstrate her opposition to the dictatorship of Rafael Trujillo in her own country -- and for her work on international panels dedicated to making the region a zone of peace.       
         Dr. Helen Winthrop Edey, a philanthropist and psychiatrist who was active in the field of women's reproductive health and rights, died on Sept. 15 at the Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 86 and lived on Martha's Vineyard and in Manhattan.         Dr. Edey was the former Helen W. Kellogg, a daughter of Morris W. Kellogg, an industrialist who founded the Kellogg Company, a New Jersey-based manufacturer of oil industry equipment. The beneficiaries of her philanthropy included organizations trying to control population growth and to give women the right to choose the number of children they have. She also supported environmental causes and nuclear arms control.         She was a former chairman and a longtime treasurer of the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, which has become AVSC International. (The term surgical contraception refers to methods of sterilization like vasectomy for men and tubal ligation for women.) The association is based in New York and works in the United States and more than 40 other countries to provide training and other support to health care professionals in the fields of family planning and reproductive health.         Dr. Allan Rosenfield, dean of the Joseph L. Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University, said, ''Dr. Edey became a psychiatrist after her four children were born and had a remarkable professional career, both as a psychiatrist and as an individual who was very much concerned about women's reproductive health and rights.''         Dr. Edey did much fund-raising on behalf of AVSC International. Working through the association and on her own, she also played a role in persuading a growing number of health care institutions in the United States to provide voluntary surgical contraception.         Dr. Edey was long active in, and on the boards of, the Scherman Foundation, which works in various fields; the Edey Foundation, set up by her husband, Maitland A. Edey, an editor at Time Inc. and an author, which supports conservation activities on Martha's Vineyard, and the Martha's Vineyard Community Foundation.         A native New Yorker, she graduated from Brearley School in Manhattan and in 1933 from Vassar. She received her medical degree in 1951 from New York University, graduated in 1962 from the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute in Manhattan and practiced psychiatry and psychoanalysis from 1957 to 1970 in Manhattan.         Mr. Edey, the co-author of the book ''Lucy: The Beginnings of Mankind'' (1981), which won a National Book Award, died in 1992. Dr. Edey is survived by two sons, Maitland A. Jr. of Martha's Vineyard and Winthrop of Manhattan; two daughters, Beatrice Phear of Cambridge, Mass., and Marion Edey of Silver Spring, Md.; 13 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.       
         Inge Aicher-Scholl, who inspired a generation of pacifists in post-World War II Germany by writing about an anti-Nazi youth movement and the killing of her brother and sister, died on Friday. She was 81, and suffered from cancer.         Mrs. Aicher-Scholl moved millions of Germans toward nonviolence by chronicling the activities of the White Rose, a student movement whose leaders included her younger brother and sister, Hans and Sophie Scholl.         Both siblings were killed by Nazis on Feb. 22, 1943, and their parents were imprisoned by Nazi authorities for several months.         In 1952 Mrs. Aicher-Scholl published a book describing White Rose's nonviolent resistance to the Third Reich and its brutal repression by the Nazis. Written in spare and dispassionate prose, the slim volume became a classic work of literature about the Third Reich.         Hans and Sophie Scholl ''came to represent not just the small band of youthful dissenters but all the pacifist sympathizers who were tracked by the Gestapo and the innumerable anonymous victims who were forced to pay the price for believing that human rights were more important than obedience to arbitrary laws,'' wrote Albert von Schirndung, a cultural critic for the Munich daily Suddeutsche Zeitung.         The book's lack of pretension and its description of ordinary Germans lent it power. ''It would have been wrong to create new heroes,'' Mr. Schirndung wrote. ''One had already had enough of heroes. The characters in 'White Rose' were people one could identify with.''         The book and subsequent writing by Mrs. Aicher-Scholl influenced many Germans who grew up after the war, reinforcing what was already a deep revulsion against the militarism that had brought the country to catastrophe and moral disgrace.         In 1946 Mrs. Aicher-Scholl and several friends founded a school for adult education and art in Ulm. One of the co-founders was her future husband, designer Otl Aicher. Mrs. Aicher-Scholl headed the school from 1946 to 1974, and remained active in Germany's peace movement throughout her life.         In the 1980's, she was a prominent figure in anti-military movements that bitterly but unsuccessfully opposed plans by the German government and NATO to station nuclear missiles in West Germany.         In 1985 she was arrested for taking part in a sit-in at the American Pershing II missile base at the southern town of Mutlangen. She and other protesters were charged with disrupting public order and given suspended fines.         Mrs. Aicher-Scholl, who died at home in Leutkirch, in southern Germany, is survived by four of her five children, Eva, Florian, Julian and Manuel; another child, Pia, died in a car accident in 1975, and her husband died in 1991.       
         Virginia E. Rice, a former head of the department at Reader's Digest that selected books to excerpt or condense, died on Aug. 19 at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 53.  The cause of death was lung cancer, said Gary D. Yanker, her husband.         Ms. Rice, who was known as Ginny, was born Sept. 1, 1944, in St. Louis. She began her magazine career at McCall's after graduating in 1966 from Marymount College. She moved to Reader's Digest in 1968 and worked there until her retirement in 1996, the last 10 years as worldwide director of book rights.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Rice is survived by her son, Andrew; her father, John H. Rice of St. Louis, and two brothers, John Rice 2d of Charlotte, N.C. and James Rice of Oakhurst, Calif.       
         Pauline Julien, who sang songs of passion and of tender love, died on Wednesday in Montreal. The chanteuse, who was 70, was most strongly identified with the songs she sang in the cause of a separate and independent Quebec.         Ms. Julien took her own life at her home after leaving a note saying she did not want to be revived, said her sister, Fabienne Julien. She said the singer suffered from aphasia, a condition that severely limits the power to use or understand words, and had grown despondent as the disease progressed.         In a singing career that spanned more than 35 years and two continents, Ms. Julien became a beloved figure to French-speaking audiences who were touched by her stirring performances and forceful style. She recorded 22 albums containing more than 200 songs, including about 30 that she composed.         She popularized homespun Quebecois music in France and helped revive the popularity of sophisticated French music in Quebec. She interpreted the music of Kurt Weill and the Quebec composer Gilles Vigneault. One of her most popular songs was called ''Tonight I Feel Tender,'' a ballad that became a theme that she performed at many performances.         But from the time she first returned to Quebec from Paris in the late 1950's she formed part of the inspirational soul of the separatist movement in Quebec. She fell in love with the Quebecois poet and journalist Gerald Godin, a staunch separatist, and fought with him for Quebec separatism.         During a crisis in Quebec in 1970 when Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau sent the Canadian Army into the streets of Montreal in response to separatist violence, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were among a number of Quebecers who were swept off the streets and briefly jailed.         After Mr. Godin was elected to the province's assembly in 1976, the year the separatist party won control of the provincial government, she appeared regularly at major separatist rallies, leading huge crowds in song and fiery speeches.         She played a major role in fighting for women's rights and in obtaining the right to abortion in predominately Catholic Quebec.         ''Madame Julien lived intensely,'' said Lucien Bouchard, premier of Quebec. ''Her voice, the words of her songs -- above all on the question of love, friendship and her country -- her charisma and her passionate character are deeply etched in our collective memory.''         Ms. Julien was born in Trois-Rivieres, Quebec, in 1928. She studied drama in Paris in the 1950's and  began singing there in bistros and bohemian clubs.         Jean Paul Goay, Ms. Julien's brother-in-law, said that on the night before she died she insisted on being taken to a show in Montreal where an old friend, the French comedian Raymond Davos, was performing. ''She told him then that they would never see each other again, but he didn't understand exactly what it signified,'' Mr. Goay said.         In the early 1990's, after 30 years of a common-law marriage, Ms. Julien and Mr. Godin were formally married. He died of a brain tumor in 1994.         In her later years Ms. Julien retired from active performing and traveled to Africa to work with the poor in Burkina Faso and other French-speaking countries.         She is survived by two children, Pascale and Nicolas, both of Montreal, from her first marriage to Jacques Galipeau, which ended in divorce.       
         Kathleen Lukens, a more or less ordinary woman whose life had such an ordinary focus on her children it is a wonder how much people made of what she saw as routine maternal devotion, died on Tuesday at her home in Tappan, N.Y. She was 67 and had been executive director of Camp Venture, a Rockland County service organization for the developmentally disabled that she founded in 1969.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         A 1952 Barnard College graduate who taught a year at a private girls' school and worked another year as a police reporter and feature writer for The Bergen Evening Record before marrying and settling into a suburban routine, Mrs. Lukens, who was born in Philadelphia and grew up in northern New Jersey, was typical of a generation of women who put their families before careers.         As a standard P.T.A. mom cum after-school chauffeur with the usual array of committee meetings and volunteer work, Mrs. Lukens, a labor organizer's daughter who was also active in the antinuclear and civil rights movements, did pretty much what any suburban mother of her era did. And if her refrigerator to-do list was a bit longer than most, she did, after all, have five children with varying needs to take care of.         As the children came along, Mrs. Lukens simply dealt with their needs as a matter of routine, feeding them, keeping them clean, nursing them through childhood illnesses and sending them off to school and camp.         It was a routine that varied only in the details. When her fourth son, David, turned out to be autistic, for example, and she discovered there were no camps in Rockland County for children with such developmental disabilities, Mrs. Lukens, who had previously helped start a nursery school for her three older sons, did the obvious thing: She started a camp for David.         She called it Camp Venture, and if at first it was more venture than camp, when it comes to taking care of children, one thing tends to lead to another, and almost before Mrs. Lukens knew it, David had grown up and she had built Camp Venture into a sprawling multiservice organization with an $18 million, largely Medicaid-financed, annual budget that now operates 15 supervised group homes, 4 day service centers and  other programs that serve about 1,000 Rockland County adults and children with an array of developmental disorders, including autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy.         To be sure, Mrs. Lukens, who told David's story in a 1989 novella, ''Song of David,'' had some help, including loving assistance from her husband, Dr. John H. Lukens, a clinical psychologist, from David's four siblings, including his little sister, and from other parents, some of whom moved to Rockland County so they could join Mrs. Lukens's enterprise and their children could benefit from Camp Venture.         Not that it was easy. At a time when the mentally retarded and those with other developmental disabilities were routinely warehoused in indifferent state institutions like the notorious Letchworth Village, to win the required government financing for supervised group homes, Mrs. Lukens had to become a public advocate, buttonholing politicians and organizing campaigns for reform.         Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller was so impressed with her eloquent appeals that he asked her to become a speechwriter. In their turns, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo declared her New York State 1984 woman of the year and named her to his advisory council on mental retardation and developmental disabilities and Gov. George E. Pataki named her to the state Provider Council in 1996.         By then, Mrs. Lukens had received so many honors and heard so much  praise it was a wonder she had any time for her nine grandchildren.         Not surprisingly, perhaps, four of Mrs. Lukens's children grew up to go into some form of social work: her oldest son, Mark, is a minister in East Rockaway, N.Y.; Jonathan of Carmel, N.Y., and her daughter, Margaret Byrne, of Orangeburg, N.Y., are clinical social workers and Daniel, of Congers, N.Y., is his mother's successor as executive director of Camp Venture.         David, now 36, has what his family describes as a happy life, living at a Camp Venture group home in New City, N.Y., and participating in activities at a Camp Venture day services center, all thanks to the efforts of a more or less ordinary woman who saw her duty as making sure her children got the care they needed.       
         Marion Donovan, a onetime Connecticut housewife who had to change one damp diaper too many, died on Nov. 4 at Lenox Hill Hospital near her home in Manhattan. She was 81 and had helped spearhead an industrial and domestic revolution by inventing the forerunner of the disposable diaper.         Her family said the cause was heart disease.         Disposable was not what Mrs. Donovan had in mind in 1946 when her second daughter came along and proved as maddeningly reliable as the first: Put her down for a nap and by the time the light was out her diaper would be wet, and her clothes and crib sheet would soon be soaked and in need of changing.         With cloth diapers serving more as wick than sponge, and with rubber baby pants virtually assuring a nasty case of diaper rash, Mrs. Donovan started looking for a way to hold the dampness in without keeping the air out.         It's not that she was immune to the joys of motherhood. After all, after marrying James Donovan, a leather importer, and starting a family, Mrs. Donovan, a 1939 graduate of Rosemont College near Philadelphia, had willingly given up her job as an assistant Vogue beauty editor in New York and moved to Westport, Conn.         It's just that unlike many stay-at-home mothers of the day Mrs. Donovan, as befitting a woman who would eventually obtain more than a dozen patents, had a genetic weakness for invention. As students at Purdue, her Irish-born father, Miles O'Brien, and his identical twin brother, Richard, had invented the South Bend lathe, an ingenious device that proved so useful for grinding automobile gears and the like that the brothers made a fortune turning them out in a factory in South Bend.         Mrs. Donovan also benefited directly from her father's ingenuity. When her mother died when she was 7, he offhandedly invented the take your-daughter-to-work movement. The Fort Wayne Lathe Works became little Marion O'Brien's after-school home and she grew up absorbed by complicated machinery.         At college, she majored in English literature, a parallel interest that had no doubt been sharpened when her father and uncle produced a little book, ''How to Operate a Lathe,'' in 1930 that sold 1.5 million copies in 78 countries.         In her quest for a dampless diaper, Mrs. Donovan was in the bathroom one day when the shower curtain caught her eye and a lightbulb went off in her head. Before you could say waterproof material, the curtain was missing a panel and Mrs. Donovan was up in the attic at her sewing machine. Three years and many shower curtains later she came up with the Boater, a re-usable diaper cover made of surplus nylon parachute cloth.         In addition to solving the soak-through diaper problem, Mrs. Donovan, made another major advance in diaper technology: replacing the optimistically named safety pins with plastic snaps.         The moisture-proof diaper covers were an immediate sensation when they went on sale at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1949. By the time her patents came through in 1951, she had sold their rights for $1 million and moved on to her next brainstorm: replacing cloth diapers with disposable absorbent paper.         As a striking woman who was forever being likened to Myrna Loy when she wasn't being likened to Rosalind Russell, Mrs. Donovan had no trouble getting in to see top executives of leading paper companies. But when they heard her idea, they laughed. As a result, it was a decade before a grandfather named Victor Mills completed her mother's work and perfected Pampers, the first mass-produced disposable diaper.         By then Mrs. Donovan's diaper days were over, but her inventing days were just beginning. When it came to finding inspired solutions to mundane problems, she was incorrigible. She reacted to an overstuffed closet, for example, by inventing the Big Hangup, a hanger that could accommodate 30 skirts or slacks in a compact space, and she solved the affront of rancid, semi-congealed soap festering in the bottom of a soap dish by inventing a wire soap holder that attached to the overflow opening and drained directly into the basin.         She got so wound up she even reinvented herself. She obtained an architecture degree from Yale at 41 in 1958. Then, after working with a Fairfield firm and designing her own house in Greenwich, she returned to inventions, including Zippity-Do, an elasticized zipper pull that allowed a woman to zip up the back of a dress by pulling down from the front.         When she saw her second husband, John F. Butler, flossing his teeth one day, she realized how painful and ungainly it was to wrap the ends of a length of dental floss tightly around one's index fingers to pull it taut. So she solved the purple finger problem by inventing Dentaloop, individual precut circles of two-ply dental floss that could be manipulated like a cat's cradle without cutting off digital circulation.         Mr. Butler died in July.         She is survived by two daughters, Christine Donovan of Manhattan and Sharon Dodd of New Orleans; a son, Dr. James F. Donovan Jr. of Oklahoma City, and three grandchildren.       
         Esther Rolle, a pioneering African-American actress who gained national recognition in the 1970's for her role as Florida Evans on two television shows, first ''Maude'' and then ''Good Times,'' died at a hospital here on Tuesday. She was 78 and lived in Los Angeles.         Larry Calhoun, her longtime publicist, said the cause of death had not been determined, but he added that Ms. Rolle had been suffering from diabetes and had been under dialysis. He said she had celebrated her 78th birthday a little more than a week ago, and that one of the last things she had done was to write a check to support a local black theater, something she had done most of her career.         Ms. Rolle met with many of her old friends and cast members of the two television shows just last week in a gathering here for a People magazine article.         Norman Lear, one of the executive producers of both of her shows, said the once-stocky actress appeared thin but vibrant, and that she had a role in a forthcoming movie, ''Down in the Delta,'' directed by the poet Maya Angelou and scheduled for release this month.         Ms. Rolle became famous for playing the role of a strong-willed maid on television, and in that role she also performed memorably in the play ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' in the television movie ''Summer of My German Soldier,'' for which she won an Emmy award in 1979, and in the movie ''Driving Miss Daisy.'' She also appeared in the film ''Rosewood.''         But she spoke firmly and often about about her desire to fight black stereotypes on television and even left the cast of ''Good Times'' for a while, saying at the time that she resented the image presented by the buffoonish character of her son in the show. In the show she played the matriarch of a struggling black family in Chicago.         Ms. Rolle was well known for her strong personality, both on and off screen, and her ear for the nuances of race relations. Mr. Lear, who was the executive producer of ''All in the Family,'' from which ''Maude'' and ''Good Times'' were later spun off, said one of his most vivid memories of Ms. Rolle was a musical number she performed with Beatrice Arthur, the actress who played Maude.         Mr. Lear said that every year there was a musical number on the show, and one season Ms. Rolle and Ms. Arthur performed ''Me and My Shadow.'' Ms. Arthur kept trying to stand in back and play the shadow in the scene, but Ms. Rolle kept slipping behind her, a striking metaphor for the subtleties of race relations that Mr. Lear described as ''an indelible memory of an indelible woman.''         Ms. Rolle was born in Pompano Beach, Fla., a retirement community that was once a bucolic farming town with the character of the deep South. She was the 10th of 18 children and her father was a farmer.         She had a theatrical bent and after high school followed her sister, Rosanna Carter, also an actress, to New York. She was one of the early members of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York and in the late 1950's performed with Shologa Oloba, an African-American dance troupe. In 1958 she and her sister appeared with the company in a revival of Asadata Dafora's ''Zunguru.''         In 1990 she became the first woman to receive the N.A.A.C.P. Chairman's Civil Rights Leadership Award for her work improving the image of blacks.         Ms. Rolle's marriage ended in divorce and she had no children, her publicist said. She is survived by two sisters and a brother.       
         Margaret Walker Alexander, who wove her experience as a black woman in the Deep South into stories and poems that captured the struggles and desires of her race, died on Monday at the home of her daughter Marion Colmon in Chicago. She was 83 and lived in Jackson, Miss., on a street named for her.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Born Margaret Abigail Walker in 1915 in Birmingham, Ala., to a minister who was educated at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., she followed in her father's footsteps. A precocious child, Margaret learned to read while still a toddler and began writing poetry at 15 when she entered the university. She received a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa.         As a member of the W.P.A. writing program, Dr. Alexander considered herself part of the Chicago Renaissance, though she claimed to have been cultivated by the writers of the Harlem Renaissance a decade earlier, most notably her mentor, the poet Langston Hughes.         In 1942, she became the first black writer to win the Yale Series of Younger Poets competition, edited by Stephen Vincent Benet, for her poem ''For My People'' from a compilation by the same name.         In it, she wrote: ''Let a new earth rise. Let another world be born. Let a bloody peace be written in the sky. Let a second generation full of courage issue forth; let a people loving freedom come to growth.''         The poem, often quoted to describe the struggles of African-Americans, became a sort of anthem for the Civil Rights movement.         Dr. Alexander later became a professor at Jackson State University, where she founded the Institute for the Study of the History, Life and Culture of Black People in 1968. She served as its director for 11 years, and the center was later renamed in her honor.         In 1966 she published ''Jubilee,'' which told the life story of the daughter of a slave and a white plantation owner. The best-selling novel, The New York Times Book Review wrote, ''chronicled the triumph of a free spirit over many kinds of bondage.''         The novel was at the center of a heated dispute in 1977, when Dr. Alexander sued the author Alex Haley, alleging that his book ''Roots'' infringed on her copyright for ''Jubilee.'' The case was eventually thrown out of court.         ''I don't know anybody who has captured the heart and soul of black people any more than she did,'' Alferdteen Harrison, who became the director of the institute when Dr. Alexander stepped down, said. ''She was our model, our mentor. She had shown the way. That was the mark of greatness.''         In addition to her daughter Marion, Dr. Alexander, who was a widow, is survived by another daughter, Margaret Williams, and two sons, Firnist Alexander and Sigismund Alexander, all of Jackson, and nine grandchildren.
