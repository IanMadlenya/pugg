         Tanaquil Le Clercq, one of the greatest of American ballerinas, who was George Balanchine's ideal muse and Jerome Robbins's happiest inspiration at the New York City Ballet in the 1940's and 1950's, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 71 and had homes in Manhattan; Weston, Conn.; and Windermere, Fla.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the New York City Ballet said.         In a tragic end to her performing career, the still-young ballerina contracted paralytic polio in 1956 while she was at the peak of her powers. At the time she was also married to Balanchine, his fourth wife. Her luminously elegant style, the freshness of her long-legged wit and her mysterious dramatic perfume had attracted an adoring public. The dance world went into shock.         Yet although she remained paralyzed below the waist, Ms. Le Clercq became a teacher at Dance Theater of Harlem, wrote two books and frequently attended dance performances. In 1998, City Ballet opened its 50th-anniversary season with a tribute to her as a charter member of the company and to her legendary status within it. Ms. Le Clercq acknowledged a tumultuous ovation at the New York State Theater from her wheelchair as Peter Martins, the company's artistic director, presented her with a bouquet.         The tribute included films of her performances and interviews. Robbins, who cast her as the sensuous girl in his ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' summed up her range. ''Tanny,'' he said, ''could do anything.''         With an elongated physique that she used with refinement or humor (Balanchine once cast her as a dragonfly), she epitomized the modernized look in classical dancing that Balanchine was promoting in the United States in the 1940's. As the first City Ballet ballerina personally trained since childhood by Balanchine, she was naturally identified with his major works and the roles he created for her in them. These ballets included ''Symphonie Concertante,'' ''Symphony in C,'' ''Bourree Fantasque,'' ''Western Symphony'' and ''La Valse,'' in which her doomed heroine danced herself to death with chilling fervor.         Nonetheless, she was equally unforgettable in the Robbins ballets and as the stunning white-faced allegorical figure of Sacred Love wafted high above the ground by a male retinue in ''Illuminations,'' which the British choreographer Fredrick Ashton choreographed for City Ballet in 1950. In 1949, she was also willing to experiment in Merce Cunningham's works in Europe.         Ms. Le Clercq was one of those singular dancers whose dramatic projection and brilliant technique could appeal simultaneously to a broad audience and a cultlike following of artists and writers.         She was born in Paris on Oct. 2, 1929. Her mother, Edith Whittemore, was American, and her father, Jacques Le Clercq, was a French poet and writer. Their daughter was named after an Etruscan queen and was 3 when the family moved to New York.         At 7, Ms. Le Clercq began studying with Mikhail Mordkin, the former star of the Bolshoi Ballet. In October 1941, she won a scholarship competition at the School of American Ballet, founded in 1934 by Balanchine, Lincoln Kirstein and others. Ms. Le Clercq also attended the French Lycee and the King-Coit School.         Although Balanchine and Kirstein had no permanent ballet company at this time, Balanchine cast her in 1945 in a student performance of ''Symphonie Concertante,'' a ballet to Mozart. After Kirstein and Balanchine founded Ballet Society in 1946, the precursor to City Ballet, she recreated her role as the second ballerina opposite Maria Tallchief, whom Balanchine had married in 1946.         As a 15-year-old in 1944, Ms. Le Clercq had also appeared in ''Resurgence,'' a short piece Balanchine created for a benefit for the March of Dimes. Balanchine portrayed an evil character, Polio, who caused Ms. Le Clercq to look paralyzed.         Balanchine would later refer to the event as an omen of the polio attack suffered by Ms. Le Clercq while she and Balanchine were on tour with City Ballet in Copenhagen. Her misfortune affected many deeply. Robbins wrote her every day during the first year of her illness.         Balanchine returned to choreography in 1957. But even in 1959, B. H. Haggin, a critic who was especially devoted to the ballerina, wrote that for some spectators, there was ''an aching feeling of loss over the absence of Le Clercq from the works in which they had watched the development of her extraordinary powers as a dancer and as a stage personality.''         Particularly amazing was that Ms. Le Clercq affected so many in a professional career that lasted only 10 years. She was not the only dancer who served as a muse to Balanchine or with whom he had a relationship. After his first wife, Tamara Geva, left him, he lived with the ballerina Alexandra Danilova and subsequently married Vera Zorina and Ms. Tallchief. He married Ms. Le Clercq in 1952, and they were divorced in 1969. There are no immediate survivors.         Ms. Le Clercq created 32 roles for Ballet Society and City Ballet. She danced the dynamic ''Choleric'' variation in the 1946 premiere of Balanchine's ''Four Temperaments.'' In 1949 she appeared in two pieces by Merce Cunningham (''Games and Trio'' and ''Amores'') in a Paris studio.         Kirstein saw her as ''the epitome of Balanchine's lyrically athletic American criterion.'' Repeatedly, she combined French elegance with American energy, as was obvious in her dance-hall girl in ''Western Symphony,'' which Balanchine set to cowpoke tunes in 1954. Strutting on toe and her needle-sharp long legs, she exhibited flair and flounce; vulgarity was anathema to her dancing.         Her work was colored, above all, by a mysterious individuality. Others succeeded her in ''La Valse,'' a neo-romantic work by Balanchine to Ravel. But few could exemplify her pathos and fragility as she threw her head back and plunged a hand into a long black glove.         In some ballets, she was irreplaceable. In ''The Concert'' (1956), Robbins's big comic hit, she was a daffy heroine who struck a serious note with a long introspective solo. Robbins dropped the solo after Ms. Le Clercq stopped dancing.       
         Linda Eder Jamieson Storrow, a former actress, magazine executive and official New York City greeter for the State of New York who was  host for 13 years of a radio program  celebrating those she called ''splendid seniors,'' died at her Manhattan apartment on Jan. 6. She was 90.         The program, called ''Looking Forward'' for its final seven years from 1991 to 1998, when it was broadcast on WYNE in New York, took up  topics from affordable housing to octogenarian sex to tap-dancing in one's 90's. For its first six years, it was called ''What Keeps Us Going'' and was broadcast starting in 1985 by In Touch Networks.         Linda Eder was born in Manhattan on Dec. 11, 1910. Her father was a lawyer whose family owned a large sugar mill in Cali, Colombia, where she spent part of her youth. At the Lincoln School, she developed a passion for acting. She made a bargain with her father that she would attend Skidmore College for one year if she could then leave school to become an actress. She became part of the company of Walter Hampton, a prominent Shakespearean actor, and also had a small part in the Broadway production of ''Cynara,'' which opened in 1931, before her father strongly discouraged her from acting because she might be taking jobs from poor people.         In 1940, she married Francis A. Jamieson, a journalist who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1933 for his coverage of the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby.         When Mr. Jamieson worked as an aide to Nelson Rockefeller in the State Department, she returned to acting for a year, playing a villainess in a radio soap opera broadcast in Washington. As Mr. Jamieson went on to play a prominent role in Mr. Rockefeller's campaign for governor in 1958, she taught reading and acting to poor children as a volunteer. Mr. Jamieson died in 1960. Governor Rockefeller appointed her the state's official greeter of foreign dignitaries in New York City.         In 1962, she married James J. Storrow III, who became publisher of The Nation magazine in 1967. In 1973, he named her associate publisher. She also wrote articles and served as its United Nations observer.         The Storrows turned the magazine over to its next publisher, Hamilton Fish III, in January 1978. Mr. Storrow died in 1984.         She is survived by her daughters, Margot Witty of Manhattan and Frances Jamieson Unger of Silver Spring, Md.; two stepdaughters, Joan-Ellen Jamieson Zucker of Oak Ridge, Tenn., and Margaret Storrow of Brookline, Mass; three stepsons, Gerald Storrow of Somerville, Mass., Peter Storrow of the Isle of Lewis, Scotland, and James Storrow of Stormville, N.Y.; seven grandchildren; seven great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandson.       
         Beverley Peck Johnson, a noted voice teacher and a member of the faculty at the Juilliard School of Music since 1964, died on Saturday in Manhattan. She was 96.         Ms. Johnson was a highly trusted and notably successful voice teacher, as the long list of eminent singers who studied with her bears out. Among her students from Juilliard were Renee Fleming, Faith Esham, Anthony Dean Griffey and Robert White. The roster of singers who came to her studio for private coaching includes Renata Tebaldi, Anna Moffo, Evelyn Lear, Giorgio Tozzi, Mignon Dunn, Theodor Uppman and Phyllis Bryn-Julson. Though she provided solid grounding in basic vocal technique, Ms. Johnson was particularly valued by students for a keen ability to find individual solutions to their problems.         Many good voice teachers play the piano well enough to accompany their students in lessons, but Ms. Johnson was one of the few who worked periodically as a professional accompanist, playing for, among others, Martha Atwood and Sigurd Nilssen. Several of her students became prominent accompanists and voice coaches, including Margot Garrett, Brian Zeger and Ken Noda.         Ms. Johnson, who kept her age secret from friends and colleagues, was born in Portland, Ore., on June 12, 1904, to Hartwig O. and Cecilia W. Peck. When she was young, her family moved to Walla Walla, Wash., where she was brought up. She studied at the White Conservatory in Portland, where she pursued a double major in drama and speech. As a young woman she moved to New York and polished her skills as an accompanist in lessons with the conductor Andre Kostelanetz. Some years later she studied voice with the tenor Hardesty Johnson, whom she married and with whom she toured as an accompanist. Her husband died in 1952.         Ms. Johnson also served on the faculty of the School of Sacred Music, Union Theological Seminary (1960-65), and the Manhattan School of Music (1982-1989), and was an adjunct professor at the Conservatory of Music, Brooklyn College.         Given her background in drama, Ms. Johnson was sought out by several prominent actors for voice lessons and coaching, including Madeline Kahn, Kevin Klein, Constance Towers, Tammy Grimes and Blythe Danner. When, during his presidency, Lyndon B. Johnson was recuperating from surgery to remove some vocal nodules, Ms. Johnson was summoned to his ranch in Texas to serve as a post-operative speech coach.         Ms. Johnson has no immediate survivors. No photograph of her was discovered in her files at Juilliard or her New York apartment, friends said. Besides keeping her age a secret, Ms. Johnson adamantly refused to have her picture taken.       
         The last queen of Italy, Maria José of Savoy, who served after World War II for only 27 days before Italians voted to abolish the monarchy, died on Saturday in a Geneva hospital. She was 94.         The daughter of Albert I, king of Belgium, Maria José in 1930 married Prince Umberto II, whose father, King Vittorio Emanuele III, cooperated with Mussolini before and during World War II.         Maria José was a little less pliant to the Fascist dictatorship, refusing to Italianize her name to Maria Giuseppina even after Mussolini made it a rule. Italians, who called her the ''rebel queen,'' described her as a closet anti-Fascist. When she fled Rome for Switzerland after Mussolini's fall in 1943, she reportedly told friends that she regretted not having joined Italian Partisans who fought to oust the Germans.         After the war, Maria José became queen on May 9, 1946, when Vittorio Emanuele abdicated in favor of his son, hoping that the gesture would keep the monarchy alive. It did not.  Italians could not forgive the royal family for its early support of Mussolini or for fleeing Rome in 1943 when he was overthrown and Italy changed sides and declared war on Germany.         Two years after a referendum that abolished the monarchy, Italy passed a law banning all male members of the Savoy family from setting foot in Italy. It is still in force, despite lobbying and legal challenges by Maria José's oldest son, Vittorio Emanuele, and her grandson, Emanuele Filiberto, the current heir to the throne.         Umberto and Maria José moved to Portugal even before the results of the referendum were made known, and she left her husband after a year and set up home in an 18th-century villa near Geneva, where members of the ousted dynasty spent their exile. Umberto died in 1983.         She will be buried next to her husband in Hauntecombe Abbey, in France, where many rulers of the Savoy dynasty are interred.       
         Beatrice S. Burstein, who was one of the first women to serve as a justice of the State Supreme Court and who used her position to promote social activism, died on Saturday at her home in Lawrence, on Long Island. She was 85.         In a judicial career that spanned 30 years, Justice Burstein served on three different courts in Nassau County, outspokenly voicing her liberal opinions and acting as an advocate for the rights of children and prisoners at a time when the courts and county politics were dominated by conservatives.         Justice Burstein helped set up the first outpatient drug treatment center in Nassau County, visited detention centers unannounced to check on conditions, and pushed for the establishment of the first school at the Nassau jail.         As the wife of a prominent lawyer and the mother of six, including former Judge Karen S. Burstein, a former candidate for state attorney general, Justice Burstein belonged to what one federal judge called ''the first legal family of Nassau County.''         In addition to Karen Burstein, Justice Burstein is survived by her daughters Ellen, Patricia and Jessica, all of New York; two sons, John, of Camden, Me., and Judd, of Westport, Conn.; a sister, Helen Deutsch of Deerfield Beach, Fla.; and two grandsons.         Justice Burstein was born on May 18, 1915, in Brooklyn. Her parents, Joseph and Tillie Sobel, were immigrants from what is now Poland. She attended New Utrecht High School in Brooklyn and New York University. While at college, she also took piano classes at the Juilliard School of Music on a scholarship. She earned her law degree from St. John's University and passed the New York State Bar exam in 1940.         While in law school, she met her future husband, Herbert Burstein. They married in 1937, and Justice Burstein became an associate at her husband's law firm when she finished law school. In 1958, she became a founding partner in the firm of Burstein & Agata, where she specialized in family law.         Justice Burstein was the first woman to be appointed to the New York State Commission of Correction, on which she served from 1955 to 1961. She also served on President John F. Kennedy's Commission on Juvenile Delinquency at the United Nations in 1961.         A Democrat, she was elected in 1962 with bipartisan support to District Court in Nassau County. Six years later, she was elected to Family Court. In 1972, she took a seat on the State Supreme Court in Nassau County, serving for the next 19 years, with the maximum of three post-retirement extensions.         Justice Burstein became a role model for judges seeking to extend their influence outside of the courtroom. She pushed to have psychiatric evaluations and probation reports completed more swiftly. She tried to visit every detention facility in her county, and in 1970, pushed for and succeeded in ending the solitary confinement of children.         She retired as a judge at the age of 76, but remained active in the legal system, serving as a judicial hearing officer for the state appellate division until last year.         ''She was really one of the first feminists to make a legal and judicial career in the metropolitan area,'' said Justice Jack B. Weinstein, a senior federal judge with the United States District Court in the Eastern District of New York. ''She retained a youthful interest and concern for society as it was evolving rather than as it was theoretically viewed by some court members.''       
         Carol Anne Letheren, a member of the International Olympic Committee from Canada, died yesterday, two days after collapsing while giving a speech in Toronto. She was 58.         The cause of the collapse was a brain aneurysm, according to The Associated Press.         Ms. Letheren was stricken while speaking at an alumni banquet Wednesday night at the Schulich School of Business at York University. She was placed in the intensive care unit of St. Michael's Hospital and was listed in critical condition. Her death was announced by the I.O.C. from its headquarters in Lausanne, Switzerland.         Ms. Letheren, a member of the I.O.C. since 1990, was one of 14 women among the Olympic committee's 131 delegates. Her visibility and forthright handling of one of the most embarrassing scandals in the history of the Olympic Games paved the way for her selection to the I.O.C.         She was the head of the Canadian delegation at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul, South Korea, when the Canadian sprinter Ben Johnson tested positive for an illicit anabolic steroid. It was Ms. Letheren who asked Johnson to return his gold medal and who made the stunning announcement to the news media that the Olympic champion had failed a drug test.         ''We are acutely aware of how devastating this news will be to millions of people,'' Ms. Letheren said at the time.         The Johnson episode represented a kind of end of innocence about doping in Olympic-related sports. Since then, many spectacular performances in sports like track and field and swimming have been met with public skepticism.         Ms. Letheren is survived by her husband, Michael, and a son, Dan.         A collegiate badminton champion, Ms. Letheren later served as a judge in the gymnastics competition at the Summer Olympics of 1976, 1980 and 1984, according to her official I.O.C. biography. From 1990 to 1994, she also served as president of the Canadian Olympic Association.         At the time of her death, Ms. Letheren was serving as a member of the board of directors for Toronto's bid to secure the 2008 Summer Olympics in a competition against other favorites such as Beijing and Paris.       
         Pauline Koner, one of the eclectic individualists of contemporary American dance, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         A choreographer noted for powerful solos, Miss Koner was also a principal dancer with the José Limón Dance Company, a leading modern-dance troupe of the 1940's and 50's. Stylistically versatile, she contributed to early television dance, taught dance around the world and choreographed stage shows at the Roxy Theater in New York and several ice revues. Although usually categorized as a modern dancer, she was fond of saying, ''I never had a modern-dance lesson in my life.''         She was born in New York in 1912,  the daughter of immigrants from Russia. Her father, Samuel Koner, a lawyer, had devised a medical plan for the Workmen's Circle, a Jewish socialist and benevolent organization; the result is considered a pioneering group medical plan.         Interested in the arts, Miss Koner wanted to study ballet with Michel Fokine, the most important balletic reformer of the early 20th century.  Her family considered his fees exorbitant, so her father offered his legal services free to Fokine in exchange for ballet lessons for young Pauline.         Miss Koner also studied Spanish dance and worked with Michio Ito and Yeichi Nimura, Japanese choreographers who blended Asian dance with Western modern dance.         Discussing her training in her autobiography, ''Solitary Song'' (Duke University Press, 1989), Miss Koner said she derived her speed and precision from ballet, her smoothness in covering space from Asian dance and her rhythm and dynamics from Spanish dance.         She presented her first solo concert on Dec. 7, 1930, and John Martin, then the dance critic for The New York Times, said that the event ''exhibited her unquestionable right to stand alone.'' He added, ''She can build a dance far better than the average, she can perform it with complete authority.''         Miss Koner toured Egypt and Palestine in 1932 and taught and performed in the Soviet Union from 1934 to 1936. Her solos then included  works on biblical themes, the ''Suite of Soviet Impressions,'' the satirical ''Three Funeral Marches'' and dances in Spanish and Arabian styles.         Miss Koner's career often took unexpected turns. In the early 40's she created dances for the Roxy and for ''Holiday on Ice.'' She began to choreograph for CBS television in 1945, experimenting with effects that only a camera could produce.         The most important change in her artistic development came that year  when, after a solo concert, she received a note from Doris Humphrey, the legendary American modern dance pioneer.         Humphrey praised the program, yet added criticism that Miss Koner found so perceptive that she sought out Humphrey and asked her to be her adviser, her ''outside eye,'' as she called her. Thereafter, Miss Koner would submit all her new choreography to Humphrey for comment. ''Our work together was a continuous revelation,'' she wrote in her autobiography, and added that after Humphrey's death in 1958: ''She inhabits me. She is my dybbuk.''         Martin declared in The Times in 1955 that, by working with Humphrey, Miss Koner ''has arrived at her true fulfillment'' and that the decision to ally herself with a mentor ''was an act of high artistic insight.'' Miss Koner honored Humphrey's memory in 1962 with ''The Farewell,'' an elegiac 30-minute solo that became her best-known piece of choreography.         Humphrey served as the artistic adviser to the Limón company and she and Limón asked Miss Koner to perform with the troupe. As a result, she became what she termed ''a permanent guest artist'' with the company from 1946 to 1960, creating roles in such major works as Limón's ''Moor's Pavane'' (1949) and Humphrey's ''Ruins and Visions'' (1953).         At the same time, she choreographed for herself and other dancers with productions ranging in tone from ''Cassandra'' (1953), a warning against hysteria, to the gracious ''Concertino'' (1955). From 1976 to 1982 she headed the Pauline Koner Dance Consort.         Petite, with dark hair and eyes,  Miss Koner riveted audiences with her intensity. She designed many of her stage costumes and was always strikingly dressed offstage. Reviewing a Limón concert for Dance magazine in 1955, the critic Doris Hering wrote that ''Pauline Koner was like some fiery bacchante as she tore through leaps and sharp shifts in direction.''         Yet however spontaneous her dancing may have seemed, Miss Koner believed that the principles of stage presence and theatrical magnetism could be learned. She became famous for Elements of Performing, a course she taught at the North Carolina School of the Arts, the American Dance Festival and other schools in the United States, Europe and Asia. The course analyzed such facets of a performance as motivation, emotion, focus, dynamics and the use of props, fabrics, lights and sound.         Miss Koner was married to the conductor Fritz Mahler from 1939 until his death in 1973. She received a Dance Magazine Award in 1964 and wrote for many dance publications.         No immediate family members survive.         Correction:  February 12, 2001, Monday  An obituary of the dancer Pauline Koner on Friday referred incorrectly to the José Limón Dance Company, in which she was a principal in the 1940's and 50's. It remains a leading modern-dance company; its prominence was not limited to those decades.       
         Alice M. Gritsavage, who was chief nurse of the Far East command during the Korean War and Gen. Douglas MacArthur's nursing consultant, died on Monday in Daytona Beach, Fla. She was 98.         In the Korean War, Ms. Gritsavage revolutionized the command structure of the Army Nursing Corps, obtaining hospital supplies when equipment was scarce and helping get the military to commission male nurses on an equal footing with women.         At the time male nurses were drafted as enlisted men but were forbidden to be commissioned with their female counterparts because the Army thought that nursing was for women only.         Her insistence that these men serve on an equal footing led to an effort to discharge her, which was stopped by General MacArthur, then commander of the American forces in the Far East. She was the only woman on the general's staff.         Reared in Glen Lyon, Pa., Ms. Gritsavage received her nurse's training at King's County Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y., earned a pharmacist degree from Temple University in Philadelphia and a master's degree in nursing administration from Incarnate Word College in San Antonio.         She joined the Army in November 1942 and during World War II served in Africa, France and Italy.         Ms. Gritsavage received many medals and citations, including the Bronze Star and two Legion of Merit awards. She retired as a colonel in 1962 after 20 years of service, and became a vocal spokeswoman for veterans' affairs.         The Korean War Veterans Association named its Ocala chapter after her, its first to be named after a woman.         Ms. Gritsavage is survived by a sister, Jennie Clard.       
         Kay Willis, who used the skills she honed as a mother of 10 to organize a national parents' support group and write a popular book on how to be a good parent, died on April 5 at a hospital in Montclair, N.J. She was 71 and lived in Rutherford, N.J.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Believing that the women's movement was overshadowing motherhood, Mrs. Willis and a few like-minded women formed Mothers Matter, an educational group, in Rutherford in 1975, in the home where she and her husband, Benedict, raised six daughters and four sons.         For the next 25 years she spread her gospel on the vital importance of healthy child-rearing to families and to the country. She lectured widely, conducted seminars, appeared on national television programs and served on industry advisory boards on toys and other products.         Most of her seminars were directed at mothers, usually 15 to 50 of them at a time. But she and her husband, Benedict P. Willis, also started a series of seminars for fathers, which she continued after his death.         Mrs. Willis, assisted by Maryann B. Brinley, published '''Are We Having Fun Yet? The Sixteen Secrets of Happy Parenting'' (Warner Books, 1998). It has been translated into six languages and remains in print in this country.         Catherine Rubacky Willis was born in Passaic, N.J. She attended Chestnut Hill College in Philadelphia but left before graduation in 1950 to marry and start a family.         Her husband died in 1988. She is survived by their daughters, Jo-Ellen Willis-Rose of Little Rock, Ark.; Kim, of Boulder, Colo.; Patricia and Maureen, of Rutherford; Fran White of Dallas; and Jeanne, of Manhattan; their sons, Benedict 3rd, of Ramsey, N.J.; Timothy and Jerry, of Rutherford; and Dan, of East Rutherford; two brothers, Dr. Gerald Rubacky of Monclair, N.J., and Joseph Rubacky of Wyckoff; a sister, Ellen Tobin of Bay Head, N.J.; and 11 grandchildren.         Mrs. Willis regarded bringing up baby as the most important job anyone could have. One of her central messages was that in order to take good care of children, parents must take good care of themselves. Parenthood, she said, was to enjoy, not just to endure.         Of course there were practical considerations, too.         ''In my lifetime,'' she once said, ''the two biggest advances in raising children have been the clothes dryer and the disposable diaper.''       
         Frances Ann Cannon Dougherty, a theatrical producer, died on April 25 at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 82.         Ms. Dougherty began her career in the late 1950's with the Phoenix Theater. In 1961 she and another producer, Michael Dewell, founded the National Repertory Theater. The N.R.T.'s Broadway productions included ''The Crucible'' (1964), ''The Seagull'' (1964), ''Tonight at 8:30'' (1967) and ''The Imaginary Invalid'' (1967) and featured actors like Eva Le Gallienne, Farley Granger and Denholm Elliott. Its touring productions included ''Mary Stuart'' and ''The Trojan Women.'' The company received a Tony Award in 1965 for its work in producing classical theater.         In 1983 Ms. Dougherty was a co-founder with Anthony Stimac of the Musical Theater Works in Greenwich Village, a development center for new musicals. She also served as chairwoman of the John Drew Theater in East Hampton.         Ms. Dougherty's first marriage, to the writer John Hersey, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her husband, Frazer; four children from her first marriage, Martin C. Hersey, John R. Hersey, Ann B. Hersey and Baird Hersey; four stepchildren, Frazer P. Dougherty, Rush H. Dougherty, Ariel M. Dougherty and Page D. Delano; and 14 grandchildren.       
         Dorothee Metlitzki, a retired professor of English at Yale and a prominent scholar of medieval Arabic, Middle English and Herman Melville, died on April 14 in Hamden, Conn. She was 86.         Her most definitive work focused on the intersection of Arabic and English culture during the Middle Ages, but she was also known for her scholarship on Melville, Chaucer and ''The Pearl,'' a seminal medieval poem.         Dr. Metlitzki was born in Germany and spent part of her childhood in Russia, where her family fled the Bolsheviks for two years. She grew up in Lithuania. Although English was not her native language, she gained renown teaching and writing about American and British culture.         At Yale and elsewhere, Dr. Metlitzki was known as a riveting lecturer and storyteller who would regale her audiences with firsthand accounts of some of the 20th century's most turbulent times. Her father, an international businessman, was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks but later freed by his own workers. And Dr. Metlitzki herself left Eastern Europe just as the Nazis were coming to power and lost members of her family to the Holocaust.         When she was 17, she went to the University of London, where she became a protégée of Moshe Sharett, who later became the second prime minister of Israel. After receiving a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees, she moved to Jerusalem and took part in Israel's founding.         She was a co-founder of the English Department at Hebrew University, helped found a self-help organization for Arab women and traveled around the world marshaling support for the Jewish state.         When Golda Meir was prime minister of Israel, Dr. Metlitzki served in her government: she worked as press officer for the Foreign Ministry and secretary for the affairs of Arab women in the Israeli Federation of Labor.         In 1954 Dr. Metlitzki enrolled in the new Ph.D. program in American Studies at Yale. She then taught English at the University of California at Berkeley and became the second woman to receive tenure in Berkeley's English department.         In 1966 she returned to Yale and there, too, became the second woman in the English department to receive tenure. A philologist who spoke eight languages, Dr. Metlitzki taught at Yale until she turned 70 in 1984. After retiring, she continued to lead seminars and remained an active scholar until her death.         Among her published works are ''The Matter of Araby in Medieval England'' (Yale University Press, 1977) and ''Melville's Orienda'' (Yale University Press, 1960).         Dr. Metlitzki married three times. She is survived by a daughter from her second marriage, Ruth Grdseloff, of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Lillian R. Berkman, a pioneering businesswoman, a collector of Renaissance art and an arts patron involved with many of New York's cultural institutions, died on May 1 at her home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was liver failure.         Ms. Berkman founded the American Tractor Corporation with her first husband, Marc. B. Rojtman, and became one of the first female executives in heavy-equipment manufacturing. She later served on the boards of many corporations, including Allied Stores Corporation and Sterling National Bank. Mr. Rojtman died in 1967.         She was a member of the dean's advisory board at the Harvard Law School, where she established, with her second husband, Jack N. Berkman, the Berkman Center for Internet and Society, a research center on legal issues in the online era.         Her art collection included significant Italian Renaissance paintings as well as 18th- and 19th-century woodblock prints once owned by Frank Lloyd Wright. Among her cultural affiliations, she was a fellow at the Morgan Library, the Frick Collection and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She was an advisory director of the Metropolitan Opera.         Mr. Berkman died in 1995. She is survived by two brothers, William Dubois of Brookville, N.Y., and Harold Winters of Manhattan; a sister, Barbara Hagani of Kings Point, N.Y.; and three stepsons.       
         Adele Dellenbaugh Hofmann, a pediatrician who helped tailor medical science to the needs of teenagers, died on Friday at a hospital in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 74 and lived in nearby Laguna Beach.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         A practitioner of pediatrics for nearly 50 years, Dr. Hofmann was a leader in a movement to redefine how health professionals treated minors. She blended her knowledge of endocrinology, pediatrics, psychology and general medicine to shape  adolescent care into a pediatric specialty.         Dr. Hofmann was a founder of the Society for Adolescent Medicine, based in Blue Springs, Mo. and served as its president in 1976-77. The next year she founded the Section on Adolescent Health as a unit within the American Academy of Pediatrics; the section now gives an award in her name.         Dr. Hofmann contended that the passage to adulthood and emancipation meant difficult years for both child and parent.         ''What we're talking about is a decade,'' she once said, ''an age of human growth and development that has tremendously unique things happening emotionally and biologically.''         Over the years she published many articles on the legal rights of minors, teenage behavior and sexuality, and youths with special risks. Dr. Hofmann and Dr. Donald Graydanus wrote the authoritative textbook ''Adolescent Medicine.'' First published in 1986, it won an award from the American College of Internal Medicine the year after and went into its third edition in 1997 at McGraw Hill, where it remains in print.         She also wrote ''The Hospitalized Adolescent'' (1976), which received an American Nurses Association award, and ''Consent and Confidentiality in Child and Adolescent Care'' (1984).         Adele Dellenbaugh was born in Boston, a granddaughter of Frederick Samuel Dellenbaugh, an artist, writer and explorer. She graduated from Smith College in 1948 and from the University of Rochester Medical School in 1952.         She trained at Babies Hospital of Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center and was a National Foundation Fellow in Endocrinology at Presbyterian Hospital. She directed pediatric and adolescent programs at New York University, Bellevue Hospital, St. Luke's Hospital and Beth Israel Hospital in New York. After moving to California, she was affiliated with the Children's Hospital of Orange County and the University of California at Irvine.         Dr. Hofmann's marriage to Dr. Frederick G. Hofmann ended in divorce. He died in 1992. She is survived by a daughter, Annie Gardiner of Oakland, Calif., and a son, Peter, of Middletown, Conn.       
         Nananne Porcher, a theater lighting designer and theater design consultant, died on Sunday. She was 78 and lived in West Tisbury, Mass.         The cause was cancer, said Marion  Kinsella, her companion.         Ms. Porcher was best known for her work in dance. She was the stage manager and technical director for the companies of Martha Graham and José Limón and the New York City Ballet.         She was also the touring lighting designer and technical director for City Ballet as well as American Ballet Theater and Jerome Robbins's  Ballets: U.S.A. She is thought to have been the first American stage manager to work on programs at the Paris Opera, Rome Opera and La Scala. She also designed the lighting for solo ballet and opera performers like Rudolf Nureyev, Mikhail Baryshnikov, Teresa Berganza and Joan Sutherland.         She was a major collaborator with Frank Corsaro, the opera director, in the mid-1970's, helping to develop  systems to meld lighting, film and projections in multimedia productions for the New York City Opera and Opera Society of Washington.         Ms. Porcher became president of Jean Rosenthal Associates in 1976. Both the Rosenthal company and Osprey Designs, which succeeded it, specialized in the design of technical systems for theaters.         She and Ms. Kinsella served as  consultants for projects including  theaters, opera houses and small community theaters as well as the lighting for Niagara Falls.       
         Barbara Banning Tweed Estill, a New York civic leader, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         She served as the president of Big Sisters and for 25 years was on the board of the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies, where she focused on programs for the elderly and public social policy. She was a board member of the Leopold Schepp Foundation, and its president for 27 years. She interviewed applicants for college and graduate-school grants for the organization.  Mrs. Estill was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Smith College in 1930.         In 1943 she married Harrison Tweed; he died in 1969. In 1980 she married Holland Estill, a philanthropies executive, who died in 1987.         Mrs. Estill is survived by her daughter, Barbette Tweed Hunt of Los Angeles and three grandchildren.       
         Louise Sulzberger, who was active in New York City social service work for many years and was a member of the New York State Commission on Aging and the community planning board for the Upper East Side, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 103.         Mrs. Sulzberger was the wife of David Hays Sulzberger, a stockbroker who was the brother of Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times from 1935 to 1961. Her father was Hugo Blumenthal, a banker and philanthropist who was president of the Mount Sinai School of Nursing for many years.         Louise Mayer Blumenthal, who was born in New York and educated at Miss Jacobi's, a private school, founded and directed the Yorkville Neighborhood Club, a recreation center for older people. She served as a nurse's aide at Roosevelt Hospital during World Wars I and II. She was named to Community Board No. 8 by former Mayor Edward I. Koch.         An avid golfer, Mrs. Sulzberger was women's champion of the Century Country Club in Purchase, N.Y., in 1929, 1933 and 1939, and won several Westchester County championships and New York State senior tournaments.         David Hays Sulzberger died in 1962. Mrs. Sulzberger is survived by two daughters, Jean Sulzberger and Ann S. Sand, both of New York City, and by 7 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Ellen S. Straus, died in 1995.

Walter Blumenthal, a financier and art collector, who died in 1969, and a cousin, George Blumenthal, a banker and president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, who died in 1941.       
         Katharine Graham, who transformed The Washington Post from a mediocre newspaper into an American institution and, in the process, transformed herself from a shy widow into a publishing legend, died yesterday after suffering head injuries in a fall on a sidewalk on Saturday in Idaho. She was 84.         Mrs. Graham had been attending a business conference in Sun Valley. She was flown to a hospital in Boise, where she underwent brain surgery but never recovered consciousness, her son Donald E. Graham said.         Mrs. Graham was one of the most powerful figures in American journalism and, for the last decades of her life, at the pinnacle of Washington's political and social establishments, a position this insecure wife and mother never imagined she would, or could, occupy.         It was only after she succeeded her father and her husband as president and later publisher of The Washington Post, a newspaper with a modest circulation and more modest reputation, that it moved into the front rank of American newspapers, reaching new heights when its unrelenting reporting of the Watergate scandal contributed to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974.         Mrs. Graham's courage in supporting her reporters and editors through the long investigation was critical to its success. Three years before Watergate, she gave solid backing to The New York Times in a historic confrontation with the government when she permitted her editors to join in publishing the secret revelations about the war in Vietnam known as the Pentagon Papers.         Mrs. Graham would have been the first to say the single greatest decision of her professional career was not in publishing the Pentagon Papers nor in exposing the Watergate scandal but in hiring Benjamin C. Bradlee to be her editor. With her support he forged a staff of reporters and editors that made The Washington Post a force in the capital and in the world of journalism.         Mrs. Graham capped her career when she was 80 years old in 1998 by winning a Pulitzer Prize for biography for her often painful reminiscence, ''Personal History'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Nora Ephron, in her review of the best-selling memoir in The New York Times Book Review, wrote of Mrs. Graham, ''The story of her journey from daughter to wife to widow to woman parallels to a surprising degree the history of women in this century.''         Mrs. Graham was a socialite mother of four when her husband, Philip L. Graham, committed suicide in 1963. Her father had given Mr. Graham control of The Post and when the latter died, his widow found herself in a mysterious thicket of corporate politics dominated by men unaccustomed to a woman in the boardroom and highly skeptical of her ability to run a newspaper.         Mrs. Graham saw herself at best as only as an interim caretaker who would try to hold on to The Post for her children. She became something quite different -- the effective steward of a multimillion-dollar communications empire.         ''It's sort of like a fairy tale,'' Mrs. Graham said on being told of her Pulitzer Prize. But her life was its own sort of fairy tale.         She was born in New York City on June 16, 1917. Her father, Eugene Meyer, made his fortune on Wall Street, became a governor of the Federal Reserve Bank, went on to organize the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and was appointed the first president of the World Bank. Her mother, the former Agnes Ernst, was a tall, self-absorbed woman of intellectual and artistic ambition. She was scathingly critical and often harsh with her daughter, the fourth of five children.         The children were brought up in the traditions of St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, the church of presidents, where the Meyers -- Mr. Meyer was Jewish, his wife Lutheran -- had their own pew. Mrs. Graham remembered a lonely childhood in palatial houses in Mount Kisco, N.Y., and in Washington. Her father was often away working, her mother traveling and writing  letters home about her social conquests.         In the absence of maternal warmth and support, Katharine became attached to her governess. Later, she went to the Madeira School for Girls in Virginia. She spent two years at Vassar before transferring to the University of Chicago. Neither of her parents attended her graduation in 1938.         When Katharine was 16, no one thought to tell her that her father had bid $825,000 at public auction to buy the bankrupt Washington Post, a paper with a circulation of 50,000 that was losing a million dollars a year, the fifth newspaper in a five-newspaper town. Later, with yearnings of her own to get into journalism, she took a job at The San Francisco News before going to The Post to work on the editorial page and handle letters to the editor. ''If it doesn't work, we'll get rid of her,'' her father said.         'The Tail to His Kite'         Washington, in 1939, was full of young people converging on the capital to work for The New Deal. Among them was Philip L. Graham of Florida, a brilliant lawyer and a clerk at the Supreme Court, first for Justice Stanley Reed and then for Felix Frankfurter. Shy and insecure, Katharine Meyer could not believe her luck when he asked her to marry him. The heiress agreed to his terms -- that they return to Florida and his father's dairy business, provided, she remembered, that ''I could live with only two dresses because I had to understand that he would never take anything from my father or be involved with him and we would live on what he made.''         It did not work out that way, and Mr. Graham soon accepted his father-in-law's invitation to join The Post. He became associate publisher at 30 and publisher at 31. Mr. Meyer also arranged for him to hold more stock in the company than his daughter because, he explained to her, ''no man should be in the position of working for his wife.'' Mrs. Graham did not object because she knew how important it was to her father to keep The Post in the family, and, she wrote, ''in those days, of course, the only possible heir would have been a male.''         Mrs. Graham was belittled and silenced by a husband she adored, the man she called ''the fizz'' in her life. When he drank too much, gave vent to his rage or frequently became ill, she attributed it to the pressure of his work and not to a serious emotional affliction that had not yet been identified.         ''Our relationship resembled that of a chief executive officer Phil and a chief operating officer me,'' Mrs. Graham wrote in her memoir. In addition to handling all domestic matters, she paid all their living expenses from her own trust fund so her husband could pay back the debt he incurred buying even more Post stock.         Mr. Graham was immersed in building up The Washington Post, conducting negotiations to buy the rival Times-Herald and merging it with his paper, and waging political battles as The Post took on Senator Joseph McCarthy and his brand of anti-communism. Later Mr. Graham became an even more influential figure in Washington, a close friend of President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.         ''I increasingly saw my role as the tail to his kite and the more I felt overshadowed, the more it became a reality,'' Mrs. Graham wrote.         Mr. Graham had his first breakdown in 1957. His recovery was slow, but he eventually re-emerged into Washington life. In 1961, at the urging of Mr. Bradlee, then a young reporter at Newsweek, he negotiated the purchase of the weekly newsmagazine. He also added television stations to the company's holdings.         What his wife later described as his ''hyperactivity, rage and irrationality'' grew. Mrs. Graham was shattered when she discovered that her husband was having an affair with a Newsweek employee. But there was an added blow: she discovered he had a scheme to pay her off and take ownership of The Post, in which he already had controlling interest because her father had given him the majority of Class A shares.         But she decided to fight back. She resolved not to give her husband a divorce unless he gave up enough controlling stock in the Post to give her majority interest.         Mr. Graham became increasingly ill and was in and out of a mental hospital. Finally, his illness had a name, manic depression. The kinds of drugs that were later developed for his condition were not available then, and Mr. Graham, on the advice of his psychiatrist, refused such drugs that were in use. In August 1963, while on a weekend leave from the hospital, Philip Graham, then 48 years old, took one of his hunting rifles and shot himself to death at their farm in Virginia.         Holding On to The Post         As she mourned, the 46-year-old widow sought ways to hold on to The Post until her sons were old enough to run it. (Her daughter was not a candidate in her plan.) Mrs. Graham wrote that she was startled when her friend Luvie Pearson, the wife of the columnist Drew Pearson, told her to run the paper herself. ''Don't be silly, dear. You can do it,'' Mrs. Pearson told her. ''You've got all those genes. . . . You've just been pushed down so far you don't recognize what you can do.''         Mrs. Graham met with the directors of The Post a month after her husband's death and told them that the paper would not be sold and that it would remain in the family. She was elected president of the company, but she felt ''abysmally ignorant'' about how to proceed.         She said she was embarrassed to talk to her own reporters, timid in dealing with the paper's executives and uncomfortable with balance sheets. Both at The Post and in the wider journalistic community, Mrs. Graham was usually the only woman at meetings and dinners. The men hardly knew what to make of her.         Although she had absorbed a great deal over the years from both her father and her husband, she did not feel up to the job as she tried to learn from the top. With the advice and support of friends like the columnists Walter Lippmann and James Reston, she began to feel some level of comfort at The Post, but she still felt shaky at Newsweek, where she went through a series of hirings and firings that some staff members recall as creating havoc at the magazine.         Two years after taking over The Post, she hired Mr. Bradlee, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief, to be deputy managing editor and then quickly moved him up to executive editor. They made a formidable team, propelling The Post into one of its most dynamic periods. With Mrs. Graham's backing, Mr. Bradlee forged a staff of reporters and editors and put out a breezy, gutsy paper that investigated government with gusto. A saucy, impertinent Style section appeared that would soon be imitated by competitors but never matched.         Mr. Bradlee's brassy style galvanized his staff and invigorated his publisher.         'The Most Powerful Woman'         As Mrs. Graham struggled to take hold at The Post, she slowly started putting her personal life together. Truman Capote gave what could only be called a coming-out party for her, the Black and White Ball at the Plaza in New York, which was not only  the social event of the 1966 season, but also a masked ball of such glamour that it is considered one of the legendary parties of the 20th century.         She wrote, ''For one magic night I was transformed.''         Mrs. Graham's memoir quoted Gerald Clarke, one of Mr. Capote's biographers, as saying: ''She was arguably the most powerful woman in the country, but still largely unknown outside Washington. Putting her in the spotlight was also his ultimate act as Pygmalion. It would symbolize her emergence from her dead husband's shadow; she would become her own woman before the entire world.''         In 1969, and still with considerable trepidation, Mrs. Graham added the title of publisher to her position as president of the Washington Post Company.         In June 1971, The New York Times started publishing the secret history of decision-making during the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers. After a few days, a federal judge put The Times under a temporary restraining order, the first time in American history that such an order of prior restraint had been imposed.         The editors and reporters at The Post scrambled to get their own copy of the Pentagon Papers. There was a crisis atmosphere, for at the same time the Washington Post Company was in the process of being taken public, raising concerns that the company could face harsh retribution from federal regulators if it published the Pentagon Papers while The New York Times was enjoined. When The Post obtained its own copy, it was left to Mrs. Graham, as publisher, to decide whether to risk publication.         The editors and reporters urged her to publish the papers, but the lawyers suggested waiting, fearing the whole company -- its newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations -- was at stake. Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Frightened and tense, I took a big gulp and said, 'Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Let's go. Let's publish.' ''         At the Supreme Court, the Times and Post cases were heard together, and the justices voted, 6 to 3, on June 30, 1971, against restraining publication of the Pentagon Papers on the ground of endangering national security. That vote is considered a major triumph for freedom of the press.         Mr. Bradlee called the publication of the Pentagon Papers a key moment in the life of the newspaper. ''It was just sort of the graduation of The Post into the highest ranks,'' he said. ''One of our unspoken goals was to get the world to refer to The Post and New York Times in the same breath, which they previously hadn't done. After the Pentagon Papers, they did.''         In a statement yesterday, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman emeritus of The New York Times Company, said:         ''We are deeply saddened by the passing of Katharine Graham, a close friend and honored colleague. She will be remembered as a truly remarkable woman, who had a profound effect on the course of events, both at home and abroad. Throughout the last half of the 20th century, she used her intelligence, her courage and her wit to transform the landscape of American journalism, and everyone who cares about a free and impartial press will greatly miss her. We certainly will.''         Weathering Watergate         On June 17, 1972, five months before Nixon's re-election, five men were caught breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate complex. The Post began an intense investigation that eventually connected the break-in to the White House.         In the face of intimidation by the Nixon administration, The Post relentlessly published front-page articles by two little-known reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and complemented them with editorials and Herblock cartoons. It eventually proved that what the Nixon administration characterized as a ''third-rate burglary'' was, instead, a scheme directed from the White House to illegally gather intelligence on the Democratic Party, discredit opponents of the administration and subvert the democratic political process.         The Post was alone on reporting Watergate for so long that Mrs. Graham was constantly asking herself, ''If this is such a hell of a story, then where is everybody else?''         In the course of the paper's investigation, the licenses of two of the company's television stations were challenged. Mrs. Graham was advised never to be alone and was also threatened with unspecified retaliation if The Post published an article that said John Mitchell, when he was attorney general, controlled a secret fund that was used to spy on the Democrats. Mr. Mitchell memorably  warned Mr. Bernstein that ''Katie Graham'' would have a breast ''caught in a big fat wringer if that's published.'' Bob Woodward later presented Mrs. Graham with an old-fashioned wooden laundry wringer, which she kept in her office ever after.         At the beginning of the next year the Watergate burglars pleaded guilty, and one of them, hoping to get a more lenient sentence, wrote to John J. Sirica, a federal district judge, to inform him that perjury had been committed and that higher-ups were behind the break-in. That letter vindicated the time and space The Post had devoted to the scandal. For its Watergate reporting, the newspaper was awarded the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for public service.         Meanwhile, the Senate began investigating the scandal and a special prosecutor was appointed. In April 1973, Nixon accepted some responsibility. But in July, it was disclosed that a taping system in the Oval Office had recorded his every word. The tapes revealed that Nixon had ordered a cover-up. He resigned in August 1974.         Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Without the tapes, the true story would never have emerged. In fact, I believe that we at The Post were really saved in the end by the tapes and the lucky chance that they weren't destroyed.''         Meeting the Elite         In time, as Mrs. Graham became more comfortable with her ability to exercise power, she took trips to confer with foreign leaders, usually accompanied by one of the reporters and her friend Meg Greenfield, who was editor of the editorial page of The Post and a columnist for Newsweek. Mrs. Graham liked to tell the story of her visit to a village in the Ivory Coast where the chief exclaimed what an honor it was to have with them the 17th most important person in the world, a description that she said he had apparently picked up from a poll that had appeared in U.S. News & World Report.         In Washington she started to entertain the political elite at her home in Georgetown and an invitation from her came to be seen as second only to an invitation to the White House.         President Bush recalled in a statement yesterday how Mrs. Graham had welcomed him and his wife, Laura, to Washington with a dinner at her home, as she had with other presidents. He called her ''a true leader and a true lady, steely yet shy, powerful yet humble, known for her integrity and always gracious and generous to others.''         The ''A'' list of the world attended her parties. By the time of her 70th birthday, she had become so powerful a figure that Art Buchwald said in his toast at her party, ''There is one word that brings us all together here tonight. And that word is 'fear.' ''         With the help of the women's movement, and particularly through discussions with Gloria Steinem, Mrs. Graham said she became more cognizant of the causes of her own insecurities and more aware of the problems of working women. She played a signal role in changing Washington mores when it became widely known that on one evening after dinner, she had refused to join the ladies upstairs while the men discussed world affairs over brandy and cigars. And  more women were added to the staffs of both The Post and Newsweek, partly because Mrs. Graham came to understand it was necessary, partly as a result of lawsuits, and partly because of a new climate throughout the country.         Over the years, she found a little time for a personal life. She was courted by a number of men, among them Adlai E. Stevenson after his failed runs for the presidency. She enjoyed weekends at her homes in Virginia and Martha's Vineyard, often in the company of her grandchildren.         Besides her son Donald, she is survived by her daughter, Elizabeth Weymouth, known as Lally; her sons William and Stephen; a sister, Ruth Epstein of Bronxville, N.Y.; 10 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         The funeral is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday at the National Cathedral in Washington.         The Business of News         Mrs. Graham's resolve on editorial questions often contrasted with indecisiveness on business matters. In the 1970's, she acknowledged in her book, she hired and dismissed top executives at Newsweek, the newspaper division and the Washington Post Company too frequently.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Graham and her associates tried to make the Washington Post Company more profitable. Newsweek took the lead among news magazines in increasing subscription and newsstand prices. But holding down costs at The Washington Post led to a bitter confrontation with the mechanical unions.         The clash came in October 1975, when the newspaper's pressmen went on strike after contract talks broke down. As the pressmen, members of Local 6 of the Newspaper and Graphic Communications Union, began their walkout, all 72 of the newspaper's presses were vandalized.         Although the paper failed to publish on the first day, a truncated issue appeared the next day. In the face of threats from the striking workers and occasional physical attacks, the reporters voted to stay on the job. Executives handled the classified advertising department, the mailroom and even the presses when they were repaired. Helicopters landed on the roof of The Post building to ferry copy to presses in Maryland and Virginia. It took nearly a month to repair the presses, but The Post continued to appear.         Mrs. Graham not only went on to win the battle of automation of her newspaper, but also to have the final word on a competitor, the financially troubled Washington Star.  The Post had 75 percent of the city's advertising linage by 1981, and The Star was forced to close. By the end of 1981, The Post's daily circulation had soared to 984,000 from 771,000.         Donald Graham succeeded his mother as publisher in 1979 and chief executive of the company in 1991, a company which by then was valued at nearly $2 billion. Mrs. Graham stepped down as chairwoman of the board in 1993, again to be succeeded by her son, but remained on the board as chairwoman of the executive committee.         Mrs. Graham served on the board of The Associated Press, and was chairwoman and president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, director of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc. and a trustee of George Washington University, the University of Chicago and the Urban Institute.         Finally, she seemed comfortable with herself. ''Worry, if not gone altogether, no longer haunts you in the middle of the night,'' she wrote. ''And you are free -- or freer -- to turn down the things that bore you and spend time on matters and with people you enjoy.''         And she did, till the end. Just two weeks ago she was surrounded by friends at the annual party her daughter gave for her in Southampton, N.Y., and last week was in Idaho for a conference of media executives where she saw more friends and colleagues. She was on her way to a bridge game when she fell.         Katharine Graham's life ended the way she said she wanted it to: ''The only thing I think any of us want,'' she once said, ''is to last as long as we're any good. And then not.''       
         Henrietta Milstein, who bought a clothing factory in Burlington, N.J., with her husband, Monroe, and helped to build it into a chain of retail stores, died yesterday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She was 72.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Mr. Milstein, who is president and chief executive of the chain, Burlington Coat Factory.         Mrs. Milstein was born on June 9, 1929, in Vienna. When Mrs. Milstein was 10, she boarded a ship to New York with her mother and younger brother to escape Nazi persecution. She studied retailing at New York University, and earned a master's degree in library science and education from C. W. Post College on Long Island.         Mrs. Milstein worked as a homemaker until 1966, when she became a librarian at an elementary school in Long Beach, N.Y.         In 1972, Mrs. Milstein advised her husband to buy a former coat factory outlet in Burlington. But, Mr. Milstein's father, a Russian immigrant who began wholesaling coats in 1924, urged him to avoid retail and refused to give them money to buy it. Mrs. Milstein offered her savings from the school job to cover most of the $75,000 down payment, and Mr. Milstein bought the business.         Mrs. Milstein continued as a librarian until 1973, helping her husband with the business on weekends. Then she began working full time as a general manager.         In 1974, Mrs. Milstein expanded the business to include children's clothing. In 1982, the Milsteins sublet store space to an outside seller of juvenile furniture. The enterprise inspired Mrs. Milstein to add a department for baby furniture and accessories, now known as Baby Depot.         The business, which went public in 1983, later added a men's division as well as linen and sportswear divisions. There are now about 300 Burlington Coat factory stores.         Mrs. Milstein served as vice president of children's wear and juvenile products from 1974 to 1997. She then retired but continued to serve on the company's board.         Mrs. Milstein established a fellowship for medical research at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital.         In addition to her husband, who lives in Princeton, N.J., Mrs. Milstein is survived by three sons, Lazer, of Monsey, N.Y.; and Andrew and Steven, of Princeton.       
         Elizabeth Bliss Parkinson Cobb, a vital and effective presence at the Museum of Modern Art in New York for nearly 70 years, died on Aug. 24 in Hightstown, N.J. She was 93 and lived in Hightstown.         Best known as Eliza Parkinson, Ms. Cobb was a niece of Lillie Bliss, one of the museum's founders, and a stepdaughter of the museum's first president, A. Conger Goodyear.         After being invited in her early 20's by Nelson Rockefeller to be a member of the museum's fledgling Junior Advisory Committee, she soon began to seek out and enlist energetic young people, many of whom were to be part of a new generation of informed and active supporters of the museum.         Agnes Gund, president of the museum, said on Monday, ''Though she was not herself able to collect on the scale of either her aunt or her stepfather, she came to feel so deeply for the museum's collections in all their variety that she regarded every one of them as her own.''         Each aspect of the museum's encyclopedic activity fascinated her. She also took pride in adventurous outposts, like the Celeste Bartos Film Preservation Center in Hamlin, Pa., which saves the Modern's movie collection from decay.         In 1939, Eliza Parkinson was appointed a trustee of the museum. Thereafter, except for service with the Red Cross during World War II, she served on the board uninterruptedly. She was president of the museum from 1965 to 1968, was vice-chairwoman from 1968 to 1993, and was named a life trustee in 1993.         As chairwoman of the building committee from 1968 to 1977, she was instrumental in decisions on how to expand the premises. ''Eliza cared so strongly for the history and for the memory of the museum,'' Ms. Gund said, ''that she could not bear to think of its being divided into two separate branches in New York. She loved every stone in those buildings and every leaf in its garden.''         Eliza Parkinson was also a prime mover in the museum's international council, which in effect gave the museum worldwide status. She was credited with an almost ambassadorial gift for diplomacy. Chairwoman of the council's membership committee in its early days, she later served as its vice chairwoman and, from 1957 to 1966, as its president. Those were the years in which postwar American painting first came to widespread international notice.         They were also the years in which the museum came to be ranked as the father and grandfather of modern-art museums the world over. Had it not been for the pivotal shows the Modern sent to Australia, Ms. Gund said, Jackson Pollock's ''Blue Poles'' might not be in the National Gallery in Canberra today.         Ms. Cobb's first husband, John Parkinson Jr., died in 1973. Her second husband, Henry Ives Cobb, died in 1999.         She is survived by a son, John Parkinson III, who was appointed a trustee of the museum in 1976 and is its treasurer; a daughter, the pianist Zaidee Parkinson; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         THERE is no saying no to Caroline H. Newhouse. But you wouldn't know it upon meeting the matriarch of the Newhouse  family in the formal sitting room of her Park Avenue apartment. She sits on a plush sofa, a well-coiffed little woman of 91, ever so sweet, so demure.         But don't let her fool you. This is one tough lady.         Just ask the many wealthy relatives whom she has ordered to fan out into the philanthropic world, assigning them to various boards and charities, even making her pitch at the family Thanksgiving dinner. (She waits until cocktails are over.)         Mrs. Newhouse is an aunt of  S. I. Newhouse Jr., the multibillionaire chairman of Condé Nast Publications. She is the widow of Theodore Newhouse, one of three brothers who founded one of the nation's biggest communications conglomerates. She has become the grande dame of charities in her family.         There was that time when Mrs. Newhouse, as an original board member of the New York City Opera, informed sorrowful board members that she planned on retiring, but she told them, rather drily, not to worry. She'd find them another Newhouse. She called up her nephew Mark Newhouse, who later became the opera board's president.         ''She didn't really offer it,'' the nephew says.  ''She pretty much told me.''         Mrs. Newhouse also put the bite on her niece  Caroline Diamond Harrison, noting pointedly that Mrs. Harrison's sister Alison Diamond Levasseur is on the junior committee of the New York City Opera, and that she too should have something to do. Mrs. Newhouse nabbed her niece for her pet charity, Career Transition for Dancers, a nonprofit group that finds new skills for retiring dancers.         ''There's no denying it,'' Mrs. Harrison says. ''She always comes out with things going the way she wants them to go.''         But in Mrs. Newhouse's apartment, her steely determination is not immediately apparent. She is a bit nervous, extending her hand in a sitting room surrounded by bronze sculptures of her own creation and artwork that includes a Renoir here, a little Rubens over there. Dressed in a salmon-colored pantsuit, she makes small talk about the weather, her failing eyesight. Her fingers drip with serious diamonds, and large South Sea pearls are draped around her neck. A uniformed servant materializes to offer refreshments.         MRS. NEWHOUSE is not keen to draw attention to herself or her philanthropic efforts. ''I don't like to talk about myself,'' she mutters. But her red-painted lips curl into a sly smile and she chuckles, confirming how she has indeed parceled out charity assignments to family members. ''Oh yes, they always say yes,'' she boasts. ''They all make time when I ask them to do something.''         As she rises to give a tour of her artwork, Mrs. Newhouse moves with fragile steps through the foyer with the marble checkerboard floor and into her small library. She pats the seat beside her on a sofa, coaxing up her gray Persian cat, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with luminescent orange eyes. ''Come, sweetheart, don't be bashful. Come here, Wolfie.''         She speaks with an accent still strong from her native Germany, which she left at 23. She has an Old World modesty, too. It takes her closest friend, Alexander J. Dubé, to loosen her up. Mr. Dubé, the executive director of Career Transition for Dancers, bounds into the room, jiggling coins that he found on the floor. They glance at each other conspiratorially. More money for the organization.         ''Go find some more,'' she says, holding open her palm.         Mrs. Newhouse has been particularly adroit at roping family members into involvement with Career Transition for Dancers, which has served more than 2,000 dancers since it began in 1985.         ''She makes them work,'' says  Mr. Dubé, 62, who met Mrs. Newhouse and her husband 26 years ago. ''She'll call them up and say, 'Why haven't you sold any tables for the gala?' or call them up and say, 'I want you to be my co-chair.' She goes after them, and no one says no to Aunt Caroline.''         Si Newhouse Jr.'s Condé Nast is a major underwriter of the organization's annual fund-raising gala in October. Another nephew, Jonathan Newhouse, and his wife, Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, have flown in from London, where they live, to be chairman and chairwoman of the benefits.         Mrs. Newhouse has donated $1 million to establish a permanent home and created a scholarship fund that has given away more than $1 million. She never studied dance herself, but often used dancers as models. She says they taught her much about their short careers, facing retirement on average around 30, or when they are injured. ''They're lost, because when you are a dancer you have no time to do anything else but dance,'' she says.         Mrs. Newhouse retired from sculpturing in her mid-70's. She began studying the arts in Germany. She was one of three children raised by her mother after her father, a military officer, was killed in World War I. She says she inherited her spirit of giving from her mother.         She met her future husband at a New Hampshire resort. When he told her he sold newspapers, she thought he owned a kiosk or hawked newspapers as a street vendor. They married a  year later, in 1956.         Mrs. Newhouse thinks she and the Newhouse family are a good match. ''They are so warm and giving, and they respect me because I am the oldest. I am the matriarch.''         Still, she won't let them off the hook when it comes to her charities.         ''They have never said no to me yet.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Nora Sayre, a film critic and essayist best known for her commentary on the cultural effects of the cold war -- died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was emphysema, said Mary Sayre Haverstock, her cousin.         As the child of parents who knew both the New York and Hollywood writing scenes, Ms. Sayre witnessed firsthand the struggles of writers in the crosswinds of America's anti-Communist fervor, which she later insisted both preceded and continued long after the era of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's red-hunting in the early 1950's. In ''Running Time: Films of the Cold War'' (1982, Dial Press), her second book, she analyzed the effect of this fervor on Hollywood movie-making in the 1950's.         In her next book, ''Previous Convictions: A Journey Through the 1950's'' (1995, Rutgers University Press), she dug deeper into the period. ''The readiness to challenge and then contradict official wisdom was supposed to be an American tradition,'' she wrote, ''but that kind of autonomy was rare in the 1950's, and I was fortunate to come of age among people who took their independence for granted.''         Reviewing ''Previous Convictions,'' David Caute, a historian of anti-Communism, described Ms. Sayre as ''an essayist whose light touch masks the formidable weight of her judgments'' and whose ''natural province is not so much history as people's consciousness.'' He continued, ''Her fault is sometimes to seek out complications which may not be there -- as in her accounts of former Communists who still feel they were right to be wrong -- but this flaw is no doubt reinforced by her affection for individuals she meets and her refusal to accept any aspect of American cold war ideology.''         Nora Clemens Sayre was born on Sept. 20, 1932, in Hamilton, Bermuda, the only child of Joel Sayre, a staff writer and war correspondent for The New Yorker and occasional Hollywood screenwriter -- he wrote ''Annie Oakley'' (1935) for Barbara Stanwyck and was a co-writer on ''Gunga Din'' (1939) -- and Gertrude (Lynahan) Sayre, a reporter for The New York World. Ms. Sayre attended the Putney School, in Vermont, graduating in 1950, and Radcliffe College, where, as she later described herself, she was apolitical and hung out with the aesthetes and actors who founded the Poets' Theater in Cambridge, and where she graduated cum laude in 1954.         ''Like a lot of my generation, I grew up with no politics at all,'' she told Brian Close, a student at the Columbia Journalism School, in a recent interview. ''I didn't even read the newspaper. Mine was a rather liberated family. But it was a very square time. Even the freest spirts were cautious. Clearly life was safer and easier if you had no politics.''         In 1955, the year after her graduation from Radcliffe, she took off for Europe with an eye to ''blotting out,'' she later reported, her parents' unhappy marriage and her mother's suicidal depressions. In London, wafted by her parents' literary connections, she met the likes of Arthur Koestler, his lover the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard (future wife of Kingsley Amis), James Thurber, A. J. Liebling, Walker Evans, Cyril Connolly, Henry Green, Graham Greene and Charlie and Oona Chaplin. She also met members of the American community in exile -- targets of Hollywood blacklisting and the United States' anti-communist campaign -- which was centered around Frognal, the house of Donald Ogden Stewart and Ella Winter, his Australian-born wife.         It was in England that she became more politically aware -- ''they may have more of a vigorous opposition than we do,'' she told Mr. Close -- and realized she was ''somewhat of a lefty.'' As she reports in her recently published memoir of that time, ''On the Wing: A Young American Abroad'' (2001, Counterpoint), she was often considered fair game by sexually avaricious older writers.         Under the tutelage of the literary critic John Davenport, she began to write for publication. As she recalled in ''On the Wing,'' ''He would arrive for an unscheduled lunch in my Bourne Street basement, bringing bacon and frozen string beans and books and imperatives: 'Why don't you eat this, read this, write about that.' Soon these editorial sessions were part of my London week: he read my pieces before I submitted them -- plucking out passages that needed polishing but never suggesting any words of his own'' and ''instilling a horror of clichés.''         She landed a job writing book reviews for The New Statesman. ''I don't want to give too much credit to the Brits because I am no Anglophile,'' she told Mr. Close, ''but they give a writer so much more freedom, especially then.'' Ms. Sayre eventually returned to the United States in the early 1960's. She had been through a brief, unsuccessful marriage to Robert Neild, a former Royal Air Force pilot, a lecturer in economics at Cambridge and a rising figure in the Labor Party.         Ms. Sayre served as New York correspondent for the New Statesman from 1965 until 1970. Her first book, a collection of pieces titled ''Sixties Going on Seventies'' (Rutgers University Press) -- which covered everything from student strikes and yippies to the 1972 Democratic and Republican Conventions  -- led to her employment at The New York Times in 1973 when her book was recommended to Arthur Gelb, then managing editor of the paper, as deserving of a review. Mr. Gelb was inspired by it to appoint her movie reviewer for The Times.         She left The Times in 1975 and for the next seven years worked as a freelancer, writing for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation, The Progressive and Esquire, among other publications, and winning a Guggenheim fellowship, 1975-76, and a National Endowment for the Arts grant, 1978. ''I managed for those seven years to break even with no other income at all,'' she told Mr. Close. ''I was able to travel. I was able to go to the dentist.'' She added: ''Freelancer has become a very offensive term. Ten years ago it was legitimate. Maybe. Now it's just another word for 'unemployed.' ''         In 1981 she became a visiting lecturer in Columbia University's writing program. Over the course of her career she also served as a lecturer and instructor in various writing workshops, including as a participant in the visiting authors program of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, the lecture series at the Museum of Modern Art, and at the Museum of Television and Radio. She was writer in residence for a semester at James Thurber House in Columbus, Ohio, and a frequent resident at Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.         She is survived by her cousin, of Oberlin, Ohio.         Ms. Sayre was proud of having covered every presidential political convention from the time she returned to this country, and she continued to work eight hours a day up until the time she entered the hospital. Living in a New York City apartment bought for her by friends, partly to help her out and partly as an investment, she wrote drafts on yellow legal pads -- ''like Richard Nixon,'' she told Mr. Close. ''It isn't all writing,'' she explained. ''Some of it is rewriting or looking at things with a critical eye. It is very easy to fill eight hours this way.''         She described herself to Mr. Close as ''of a certain age.'' She added: ''It isn't vanity, dear, but unfortunately writers are downgraded in our earnings, based on our age. They think we become less capable of grasping things.''       
         Germaine Brée, a prolific scholar of French literature who helped introduce a generation of Americans to the work of Camus, Sartre and other modern French writers, died on Sept. 22 at her home in Winston-Salem, N.C., a spokeswoman for Wake Forest University said. Ms. Brée was 93 and had been Kenan professor of humanities at Wake Forest from 1973 until 1984.         During World War II, while serving in the French resistance, Ms. Brée became a friend of Albert Camus. She was the author of numerous studies on the writer, including a critical biography, ''Camus,'' published in 1959. ''Germaine Brée's remarkable study is not likely to be surpassed for many years,'' Henri Peyre wrote in The New York Times Book Review at the time. Ms. Brée was also the author of ''Marcel Proust and Deliverance From Time'' (1955), ''Gide'' (1963) and ''Camus and Sartre: Crisis and Commitment'' (1972). She was a champion of modern French women writers like Monique Wittig, and was the author of ''Women Writers in France'' (1973). Ms. Brée also served as president of the Modern Language Association.         Born in Paris, Ms. Brée spent most of her childhood in the English-speaking Channel Islands. She earned a graduate degree from the University of Paris and taught in Algeria. During World War II, she took a leave from Bryn Mawr, where she was teaching at the time, to fight for the Free French. She joined a volunteer ambulance unit, and was eventually promoted to lieutenant; she was assigned to the intelligence section of the Free French forces in Algiers. Ms. Brée received a Bronze Star and was named to the Legion of Honor for her war service.         After the war, in 1953, Ms. Brée was appointed chairwoman of the French department at New York University's Washington Square College of Arts and Science, only the second woman in the college's history to chair a department.         Ms. Brée is survived by a sister, Murielle Laure Radcliffe, of Wokingham, England.

         Elaine Dannheisser, a longtime collector of contemporary art who gave most of her collection to the Museum of Modern Art, died on Sunday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton.         Her death was announced by a spokeswoman for the Modern, who said that she had died in her sleep.         During the 1980's in particular, Mrs. Dannheisser was a fixture on the international art circuit who rarely missed an exhibition, art fair or auction. She was famous for her malapropisms, consistently referring to the Reina Sofia, a prominent museum of modern art in Madrid, as the Sophia Loren and once telling a friend that she did not approve of ''unanimous sex.''         Mrs. Dannheisser considered her holdings ''a living collection'' and continually sold off and bought new works, often after pursuing them a great while. Although her taste tended to follow existing trends, she became increasingly drawn to what she called ''tough'' art as her self-education as a collector continued.         Elaine Fansling was born in Brooklyn in 1923. Her father was a florist, and her mother was a painter who frequently took her daughter to museums. She studied painting at the Art Students League, began working as an illustrator and continued to paint until her interest in collecting took over.         In 1953, she married Werner Dannheisser, a refugee from Nazi Germany and an owner of a successful engraving company who dabbled in collecting. With her drive and his money, the couple progressed from modern to contemporary, buying works by Picasso, Leger and Rouault, and then Dubuffet, Rothko, Rauschenberg and Agnes Martin. She often said she wished she could have lived in Paris when Gertrude Stein did, but gradually realized that she could be equally involved with the art of her own time.         Mr. Dannheisser sold his business in 1981, just as the East Village art scene was taking off and contemporary-art collecting became a very competitive sport. Mrs. Dannheisser bought a building on Duane Street in TriBeCa for the display of the collection and, with an allowance from her husband, began actively purchasing works by neo-Expressionist and graffiti artists.         In the mid-1980's, she decided these works were not demanding enough. She sold many of them and, with the profits, became one of the first collectors to buy the work of emerging artists like Robert Gober, Jeff Koons and Felix Gonzalez-Torres, and, later, Matthew Barney. The collection became international in scope and more Minimalist, Conceptualist and installationist in orientation, with most artists represented by at least two, and sometimes as many as 10, works.         Unlike many collectors of contemporary art, she did not seek out friendships with artists, saying that knowing them could cloud her judgment. One of her few artist friends was Jim Hodges, who worked as caretaker and preparator at her Duane Street building in return for free studio space in the building's basement.         Mrs. Dannheisser's involvement with museums also had phases. She served on the boards of the New Museum of Contemporary Art and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum before settling on the Modern.         She joined the Modern's painting and sculpture committee in 1990. In 1996 she became a trustee at the Modern and also gave the museum 75 works by 28 artists, one of the largest gifts in its history. Among other things, it included works by Mr. Gober, Mr. Koons and Gonzalez-Torres as well as Bruce Nauman, Sigmar Polke, Richard Serra, Cindy Sherman, Thomas Struth and Joseph Beuys.         In the 1990's, Mrs. Dannheisser's collection had quite a bit of competition from her avid interest in bridge, but she continued to buy, and to sell, art until her death.         Her husband died in 1992, and there are no immediate survivors. A spokeswoman for the Museum of Modern Art said yesterday that Mrs. Dannheisser bequeathed additional works by Willem de Kooning, Richard Prince, Cady Noland and Ashley Bickerton to the Modern, along with a cash gift of $2 million. All her other assets will go to establishing the Elaine Dannheisser Foundation.         Correction:  November 9, 2001, Friday  An obituary of the art collector Elaine Dannheisser on Oct. 30 misstated her maiden name. It was Hanfling, not Fansling.       
         Polly Rowles, an experienced character actress in theater and film whose most famous role was as Inspector No. 12 in a series of television commercials for Hanes underwear, died on Oct. 7 at a nursing home in Concord, N.H. She was 87.         Mary Elizabeth Rowles, as she was named at her birth in Philadelphia, had an acting career that covered six decades. After graduating from the Carnegie Institute of Technology in Pittsburgh, she moved to Hollywood and signed with Universal Studios. She appeared in the 1930's in the films ''Love Letters of a Star,'' ''Wings Over Honolulu'' and ''Springtime in the Rockies,'' with Gene Autry.         She made her Broadway debut in 1938 as Calpurnia in Orson Welles's production of Shakespeare's ''Julius Caesar.'' For the next several decades she kept a busy acting schedule, appearing in ''Time Out for Ginger''; ''Richard III,'' with Richard Whorf; the Richard Rodgers musical ''No Strings''; and many others. She played Vera Charles in ''Auntie Mame'' at the Broadhurst Theater for 637 performances, beginning in October 1956, and acted in a London production of ''Dark Eyes'' in 1948.         Ms. Rowles also appeared in many television programs in the late 40's and 50's, including ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents,'' ''The Naked City'' and ''Jamie,'' and in later years, ''The Defenders,'' ''Somerset'' and ''The Nurses.'' At the end of her career, in the mid-80's, she returned to film, appearing in ''Power'' and Alan Alda's ''Sweet Liberty.''         Ms. Rowles developed a reputation  for portraying snappy, sardonic older women, appearing in plays like ''Best Laid Plans,'' ''40 Carats'' and ''Steaming,'' a British comedy about women at a steam bath. Ms. Rowles played the only character who did not disrobe.         Her talent for toughness and sarcasm served her well in a series of commercials for Hanes during the 80's. She played Inspector No. 12, a stern quality-control monitor whose catch phrase was, ''They don't say Hanes until I say Hanes.'' She appeared in at least 10 ads throughout the decade, beginning in 1980, and was an enthusiastic spokeswoman for the company, a Hanes representative said, at trade conventions and at Hanes factories. It became her best-known role.         She is survived by her daughter, Constance Heath, of Concord, and a cousin, Constance Anderson, of Philadelphia.       
         Barbara Tropp, an innovative San Francisco chef, restaurateur and author of books about cooking, died on Oct. 26 at her apartment in San Francisco. She was 53 and had a second home in the Napa Valley.         The cause was ovarian cancer, The San Francisco Chronicle reported.         Ms. Tropp, a former Princeton student of Chinese and Chinese culture,  became a leading chef of the new American cuisine who liked to combine French and Chinese culinary concepts.         She delighted in serving the unexpected at her celebrated San Francisco restaurant, China Moon. For example, in 1988, when Asian influence on American cooking was felt most strongly on the West Coast but was spreading throughout the nation, Ms. Tropp served a Chinese pizzette, using Chinese scallion bread as the base. Atop the bread she placed coriander-flavored pork sausage and stir-fried wild mushrooms.         She wrote and taught about cooking as well as serving as chef at the restaurant for a decade. She sold it in 1996 because of poor health.         Her ''China Moon Cookbook'' (1992, Workman) was one of the first books that successfully brought together Chinese and European-American mainstream cooking.         The book won an award from the International Association of Culinary Professionals.         Ms. Tropp's other book was ''The Modern Art of Chinese Cooking: Techniques and Recipes'' (1982, Morrow).         Ms. Tropp grew up in Springfield, N.J., and became interested in China in high school. She graduated from Barnard College and received a master's degree in Chinese literature and art from Princeton. Then she learned about Chinese cooking as a student of poetic structure at the National University in Taiwan.         There ''classic Chinese with refined taste taught me how to eat and how to live,'' she told Craig Claiborne of The New York Times in a 1981 interview. She returned to the United States to work toward a Princeton doctorate in Chinese poetry and, she recalled, ''I had to learn to cook the food I had gotten used to eating in Taiwan.'' So she did.         Mr. Claiborne wrote that she ''speaks and writes fluent Mandarin, and this has given her a fine grasp of the meaning of Chinese cooking and menu terms.'' He said he had asked her why one of her dishes was ''called strange flavor eggplant, and she explained that it came from the word, 'guai,' which in Chinese poetry and art criticism can mean odd or weird.''         Last month she received the President's Award of the organization Women Chefs and Restaurateurs, of which she had been a founder.         Surviving are her husband, Bart Rhoades; two stepsons, Andrew and Matthew Rhoades; a stepdaughter, Elizabeth Rhoades; and a sister,  Nhumey Tropp.       
         Mary Kay Ash, who built a billion-dollar beauty empire from a $5,000 investment in 1963, and who motivated hundreds of thousands of consultants around the world with a combination of rewards, recognition and religion, died yesterday at her home in Dallas. She was 83.         She died of natural causes, said Jim Lawrence, a spokesman for Mary Kay Inc. in Dallas. Mrs. Ash had been in frail health since she suffered a stroke in 1996.         Mrs. Ash, who preferred to be called Mary Kay, was 45 when she started her company, which sells its products through home and office demonstrations by sales representatives. Within two years, the company's wholesale sales had reached almost $1 million.         ''I've been asked a number of times, 'How did you succeed so quickly?' '' she once said. ''The answer is I was middle-aged, had varicose veins and I didn't have time to fool around. Have you heard the definition of a woman's needs? From 14 to 40, she needs good looks, from 40 to 60, she needs personality, and I'm here to tell you that after 60, she needs cash.'' Her company eventually became the largest direct seller of skin-care products in the country.         Last year, the company had sales of $1.2 billion and more than 850,000 sales consultants in 37 countries, ranging from Britain, Australia and Japan to Singapore and Brunei.         Mrs. Ash, who was known as the high priestess of pink, was one of the better known figures in Dallas. She drove a pink Cadillac and, for some years, lived in a $5 million, 30-room pink palace with 28-foot high ceilings, a Grecian pool, crystal chandeliers and 11 bathrooms, one of which duplicated that of her friend, Liberace. The house was sold in 1994, and Mrs. Ash, who was twice widowed and once divorced, returned to the old and less elaborate house where she lived alone. A security guard generally trailed her, even as she pushed her cart in the local supermarket.         Her almost mythical stature in her company was as glittering as her  diamonds. Her unique public popularity engendered such enthusiasm during the company's annual seminar, a three-day multimillion-dollar extravaganza, that she often had to use little-known passageways to elude her fans. More than 35,000 sales representatives and directors and, in some years, professors from the Harvard Business School, paid to attend the education sessions at her seminars in Dallas. The highlight of the seminar was Award Night, in which Mrs. Ash honored those who were the highest achievers for her company. The awards were presented amid a show that would rival those in Las Vegas.         The glitzy seminars were a far cry from the initial company get-together in 1964, held in a warehouse decorated with balloons and crepe paper. Mrs. Ash boned and cooked chicken for 200 people, made the jalapeno dressing and Jell-O salad herself and served it all on paper plates.         As the seminars grew in size and lavishness, the rewards to stellar sales representatives grew in kind. In later years, the annual awards amounted to about $6 million -- dream vacations, jewels, furs and pink Cadillacs (winners received a pink Mercedes in Germany and a pink top-of-the line Toyota in Taiwan). By 1994, 7,000 cars, valued at more than $100 million, had been given to sales representatives.         ''Recognition is the key,'' Mrs. Ash said, explaining her success and how she devised her corporate symbols to reward her sales force. One, labeled Ladder of Success, was a gold pin with each rung marked with a jewel. A ladder covered with diamonds signified a top performer.         Mary Kathyln Wagner was born in Hot Wells, Tex., on May 12, 1918. Her mother, who had trained as a nurse, worked as the manager of a restaurant. At the age of 7, an older brother and sister having already left home, she began cooking and caring for her father, an invalid who had been in a sanatorium with tuberculosis for three years         She was married at 17. Her husband, Ben Rogers, was a radio personality in Houston and a member of a musical group called Hawaiian Strummers. The couple had three children before he left to serve in World War II. On his return, he asked for a divorce and although Mrs. Ash acknowledged that the marriage had been unhappy, the request left her, as she put it, at ''the lowest point of my life.''         With three children to support it did, however, set her off on her career. She worked for 25 years in direct sales, pitching child psychology books at the outset and later conducting demonstrations for Stanley Home Products at parties organized in private homes.         The company that qualified for inclusion in the Fortune 500 list in 1992 opened its doors in September 1963, backed by a $5,000 bank account. Her second husband planned to go into the business with her but died of a heart attack a month before the start of the business. She decided to carry on with her plans, despite the advice of her lawyer and her accountant. The business opened with nine saleswomen and her 20-year-old son, Richard Rogers, a sales representative for Prudential Life Insurance, as financial administrator.         The skin-care products that formed the basis of the company were developed by J. W. Heath, an Arkansas tanner who noticed that his hands looked younger than his face and began experimenting with the solution he used in his work. The formulas were passed on to his daughter, Ova Heath Spoonemore, who, sometime later, acted as the hostess at a Stanley Home Products party where Mrs. Ash was conducting the demonstration. When that part of the get-together was over, Mrs. Spoonemore handed out jars with penciled labels to her guests, all of whom had beautiful skin. She explained to Mrs. Ash that the women were her guinea pigs. Mrs. Ash, who also received some samples, became a fan and in 1963 bought the formulas from the Heath heirs for $500.         The philosophy of the fledgling company was based on three principles enunciated by Mrs. Ash -- treating others as they themselves would like to be treated, putting God first, family second and career third, and the belief that with praise and encouragement, everyone could succeed.         Although the product line was added to over the years -- there are now more than 200 items for women and men in skin, hair, nail and body care and sun protection -- the Mary Kay formula for success changed little. Consultants remained independent, buying products at wholesale and selling at retail, and from the beginning there were no accounts receivable or personal checks accepted. Orders are paid for with cashier's checks, money orders or credit cards, and consultants are encouraged to conduct their own business in the same way.         In addition to her financial policy, Mrs. Ash also decided that there would be no fixed territories. Consultants who line up recruits in other cities and states still receive commissions on the recruits' purchases although the newcomers are trained and guided by the directors in their home territories. The unusual system worked because, as Mrs. Ash put it, ''each sales director thinks 'I'm helping her but someone else is helping my recruits in other cities.' ''         Shares of Mary Kay were listed in 1968, first in the over-the-counter market and eight years later on the New York Stock Exchange. In the early and mid-80's, sales declined and the stock price dropped. In 1985, the company returned to private family ownership through a $450 million leveraged buyout.         Mrs. Ash's third husband, Mel Ash, who was in the wholesale gift business, died in 1980. Her daughter, Marylyn Reed, died in 1991. She is survived by two sons, Richard and Ben, both of Dallas, 16 grandchildren, 28 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.         A friend once told Mrs. Ash, ''Mary Kay Cosmetics was a divine accident looking for a place to happen.'' Her reply summed up her philosophy: ''In 1963, the social forces that now support the financial and legal equality of women had not gained public favor. And yet here was a company that would give women all the opportunities I had never had. I don't think God wanted a world in which a woman would have to work 14 hours a day to support her family, as my mother had done. I believe he used this company as a vehicle to give women a chance.''

         Bella Cabakoff Wexner, a philanthropist and the matriarch of the Limited Inc., a multibillion-dollar retail chain that specializes in women's clothing, died last Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 93 and lived on the Upper East Side, where she moved from Columbus, Ohio, in 1992.         Mrs. Wexner, with a professional background in the clothing business, joined her son, Leslie H. Wexner of Columbus, when he incorporated the Limited in 1963, as did her husband, Harry, and her daughter, Susan. For the next 34 years she served as its corporate secretary-treasurer and as a close adviser to Leslie Wexner.         She helped build the company into one of the country's fastest-growing apparel retailers. By the late 1980's the Limited, based in Columbus, had become the parent of Henri Bendel, Lane Bryant, Victoria's Secret and Abercrombie & Fitch, among others. Holdings now include Express stores, Lerner New York and a majority stake in Intimate Brands, which includes Victoria's Secret, Bath and Body Works and the White Barn Candle Company.         With her son, Mrs. Wexner in 1973 established the Wexner Foundation, which supports youth development programs, fellowships and Jewish agencies and temples. In the 1990's she devoted much of her time to charitable work at the foundation and directly for a long roster of charities in this country and in Israel, including the Jewish Agency, the Israel Education Fund of UJC, United Jewish Communities in Cleveland,  Rabbi Isaac Elchanan Theological Seminary and Wexner Heritage Village, a large geriatric complex in Columbus.         She was born Bella Cabakoff in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn and was taken to Columbus as a toddler. Even before she finished high school she worked for Federated Department Stores, where she became one of its youngest buyers.         She married Harry Wexner during the Depression and eventually they founded a women's apparel store. The Limited went public in 1969, with Mr. Wexner serving as chairman until his death in 1975.         In addition to her son and her daughter, of Manhattan, Mrs. Wexner is survived by four grandchildren.       
         Marian Fischman, a scientist who explored narcotics addiction by paying addicts to take heroin, cocaine and other drugs, died on Oct. 23 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan.         Her husband, Dr. Herbert Kleber, said she died of complications of colon cancer.         Dr. Kleber, a psychiatrist who is the director of the Division on Substance Abuse at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute, said his wife was the first research scientist since Freud to use controlled scientific experiments with humans to directly examine cocaine's effects. Past experiments were limited to animals.         His wife, who as co-director of the division directed five separate laboratories, studied how people changed physiologically and behaviorally when under the influence of drugs. The models she established  became a basis for studying potential medications to treat drug abuse.         Among other things, she tested drugs that appeared to thwart the effects of heroin and cocaine, and devised ways to study what were believed to be the greatly disparate effects of snorting cocaine versus smoking it in the form of crack. In 1996, this led her to publicly advocate more equitable prison sentences for possessing either form of cocaine. Despite the efforts of Dr. Fischman and others, possessing five grams of crack is still punishable by the same five-year sentence as possessing 500 grams of powdered cocaine.         ''The important issue is when possible to try to have science inform public policy,'' she said. ''Cocaine is cocaine. Regardless of whether you shoot it up or smoke it or snort it, it has the same effect.''         Addicts recruited to participate in her experiments received free drugs, meals, a comfortable hospital room with a VCR and a stereo, and a paycheck. ''This is a fine time in America to be a drug addict,'' the New York Post columnist Andrea Peyser wrote about the program in 1999.         Dr. Fischman's answer was that she continually offered to help participants get into treatment programs, even if their departure would harm her experiments. Nobody ever took the offer, however.         Marian Rita Weinbaum was born in Queens on Oct. 13, 1939, and grew up in an apartment above her father's drugstore. She graduated from Barnard College, earned a master's degree in psychology from Columbia and went to the University of Chicago to pursue her doctorate. She began studying how the brain learns, and wrote her thesis on the effects of methamphetamine on rhesus monkeys.         Dr. Fischman shifted her research focus to humans and from methamphetamine to cocaine. She began to examine, in physiology, how cocaine users become psychologically tolerant to larger and larger doses.         In 1984, she moved to Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, where she continued her cocaine work, setting up a residential laboratory where users could live for up to four weeks at a time.         She also studied other drugs, and proved that weekend users of alcohol were less effective on Monday mornings, and that marijuana smokers indeed developed appetites for snacks. She adapted her methods to study legal drugs for drug companies, but lost interest even though that attracted considerable financial support.         ''Her interest was not in repeating the same thing,'' said Dr. Kleber, who met his wife at a scientific meeting in Washington in 1987. Dr. Kleber served as deputy drug czar in the first Bush administration, and was a leader of Yale's drug research program.         The two moved to New York in 1992 to head Columbia's new substance abuse program, which was created for them. ''A lot of what we know about how cocaine affects humans is the result of her work,'' said  David M. McDowell, a Columbia University scientist who is one of many young researchers she mentored.         Dr. McDowell called Dr. Fischman ''the exact opposite'' of what one would expect from a researcher, recalling her love of walking, baking and single-malt Scotch. ''There was an elegance about her,'' he said.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Eric Fischman of Boston; two daughters, Sharon Fischman of Bethesda, Md., and Amanda Fischman Henshon of Boston; a stepson, Marc Kleber of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Elizabeth Kleber of Philadelphia and Pamela Shad of Greenwich, N.Y.; her mother, Sarah Weinbaum of Philadelphia; a brother, George Weinbaum of Philadelphia; four grandchildren; and four step-grandchildren.       
         Laurie Johnston, a World War II correspondent, an author and a reporter for The New York Times who was cited for the humanity and wit of her writing, died at her home in Honolulu on Friday. She was 87.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her daughter Elisa W. Johnston said.         Although she spent several months of the year in Hawaii, the island she came to love in the 1940's while covering the war in the Pacific for Reuters, Ms. Johnston was a ''dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker,'' her daughter said. Until just a few weeks ago, she was at the Greenwich Village home she moved into in 1954.         ''She spent her last few days walking around the World Trade Center site,'' Ms. Johnston said, ''and arrived in Honolulu quite frail but wearing an 'I Love New York' T-shirt.''         Ms. Johnston worked as a columnist, reporter and editor for The Times, covering neighborhoods, education and the courts, among other subjects. Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism awarded her the Meyer Berger Award for distinguished reporting in 1980, citing her ''consistently warm and perceptive glimpses of the little and large dramas of New York.''         Ms. Johnston was born in Fort Collins, Colo., and grew up in Albany, Ore. She studied English and journalism at the University of Oregon, and after graduating worked at several West Coast newspapers.         During World War II, she covered the Pacific from Pearl Harbor and was one of the few women accredited to report on both the Army and the Navy. In 1946 Ms. Johnston joined Newsweek's international news department, where she stayed until joining The Times in 1949. She retired in 1984.         In 1939 she married Richard W. Johnston, who was also a war correspondent and who eventually became the executive editor of Sports Illustrated. In 1953 she wrote ''Elizabeth Enters: The Story of a Queen'' (Scribners), a biography for which Mr. Johnston served as the picture editor. He died in 1981. Ms. Johnston later married Charles C. Woolley, who died in 1986.         In addition to Elisa Johnston, Ms. Johnston is survived by another daughter, Dana Johnston of New York City and Honolulu; a son-in-law, Barry Layne Morrison, and a granddaughter, Katie H. J. Morrison, all of Honolulu
