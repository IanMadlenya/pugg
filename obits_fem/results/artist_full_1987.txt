        Peggy Bacon, a poet, author, artist and illustrator of more than 60 books, whose whimsical pastels featured some of Manhattan's toughest alley cats, died Sunday in Kennebunk, Me. She was 91 years old. Her many-faceted career spanned several decades. She was most recently in the news in 1975, when the National Collection of Fine Arts in         Peggy Bacon, a poet, author, artist and illustrator of more than 60 books, whose whimsical pastels featured some of Manhattan's toughest alley cats, died Sunday in Kennebunk, Me. She was 91 years old. Her many-faceted career spanned several decades. She was most recently in the news in 1975, when the National Collection of Fine Arts in Washington honored her with a yearlong retrospective.         The heyday of her fame came in the 1920's and 30's, when as both graphic artist and writer, she was much admired for the wit, the charm and the plain-spoken honesty of her work, much of which consisted of satirical, though affectionate, glimpses of her day. 'Reservoir of Warm Feeling'         In reviewing the 1975 retrospective, Hilton Kramer, then the art critic of The New York Times, wrote that Miss Bacon ''brings a large reservoir of warm feeling to the most ordinary subjects - the playfulness of a cat, the peculiar gait of a man or woman in the street, an outdoor picnic or a summer camp - and if she does not always avoid a certain sentimentality, she nonetheless impresses us with her sincerity.''         In 1980, Miss Bacon received the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters' Gold Medal for graphic art in recognition of ''her long and impressive career as graphic artist and illustrator.''         Margaret Frances Bacon was born in Ridgefield, Conn, on May 2, 1895. She graduated from the Kent Place School, in Summit, N.J., in 1913, and studied at the Art Students League of New York, where she was an instructor in painting, drawing and composition from 1935 to 1936 and 1948 to 1952, She also studied at the New York School of Fine and Applied Arts.         She was the author and illustrator of such works as ''Lion-Hearted Kitten,'' ''Mercy and the Mouse,'' ''The Terrible Nuisance,'' ''Animosities,'' ''Off With Their Heads,'' ''Cat-Calls,'' ''Starting From Scratch'' and ''The Good American Witch.''         She is survived by a daughter, Belinda Bacon of Cambridge, Mass.; a son, Alexander Bacon Brook, of Sag Harbor, L.I.; four grandchildren, and a great-grandchild.       
        Elsa de Brun, who painted under the Gaelic name of Nuala, died last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease.         Elsa de Brun, who painted under the Gaelic name of Nuala, died last night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91 years old and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease.         Nuala's lyrical abstractions hang at Carnegie Hall, the Bymusbun Museum in Copenhagen, the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington and at the University of Texas.         Nuala did not become a recognized artist until she was a grandmother. Her talent was first discovered by her manager-companion of more than 40 years, Patric Farrell, the former director of the Museum of Irish Art and the Irish Theater in Manhattan's Sheridan Square in the 1920's.         They were married at Carnegie Hall on June 14, 1984, in front of her brightly illuminated stained-glass window, adpated from her pastel painting, ''Pleasure in Eternal Tumult.''         The artist was born in Stockholm and was educated there at the Anna Sandstrom School.         When she was 19, she moved with her family to New York City, where her father was an engineer engaged in import-export trade. It was not until 1946 that she began the fine-line pencil drawings that developed into her own style.         Among her most noted pastels was a collection of 43 paintings titled ''Valentines for James Joyce,'' based on ''Finnegans Wake,'' that was purchased by the University of Texas in Austin where it is housed in the Humanities Center.         Survivors, in addition to her husband, are a son by a previous marriage, the Rev. Guy de Brun, of Waxhaw, N.C.; a stepdaughter, Mrs. Laurance Wilson, of Kalamazoo, Mich.; 8 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
        Elayne Hanley Varian, an art curator and exhibition organizer, died of cardiopulmonary arrest on Nov. 4 at her home in Orlando, Fla. She was 74 years old.         Elayne Hanley Varian, an art curator and exhibition organizer, died of cardiopulmonary arrest on Nov. 4 at her home in Orlando, Fla. She was 74 years old.         With her eye for the new and the lively, Mrs. Varian was best known in New York for the provocative shows of avant-garde art that she organized in the 1960's and 1970's as director of the contemporary wing of the Finch College Museum of Art. Among the more notable were a series called ''Art in Process,'' staged over an 11-year period ending in 1973, which exposed in detail the working methods and techniques of a number of contemporary artists; two ''Projected Art'' exhibitions of experimental films, videotapes and documentaries of artists at work; two Art Deco shows noted for scholarship and selectivity, and a documentary film by the artist Les Levine that portrayed the civil strife in northern Ireland. Mrs. Varian also taught courses in museology and art history at Finch.         Elayne Hanley was born in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 1913. She was graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and later received a master's degree in fine art there. She came to New York in 1933 and worked for a while as a dress designer. She married John Varian, a lawyer, in 1936, and retired to raise their son.         In the mid-1940's, she joined the Duveen Brothers gallery, where she became assistant to the president, Edward Fowles, and remained there for 15 years. She went to Finch College as director of its contemporary museum in 1964, a position she held until the college closed for lack of funds in 1975.         In that year, Mrs. Varian moved to Orlando, where her husband had retired. For three years, she served as curator of contemporary art at the John and Mabel Ringling Museum in Sarasota. After leaving there in 1978, she did art appraisal work and mounted several shows as a freelance curator.         She is survived by her husband and by a son, Alfred, of Stowe, Vt.       
        Minnie Evans, a folk artist whose vividly colored works were often inspired by dreams and religious visions, died Wednesday at the Grotgen Nursing Home in Wilmington, N.C. She was 95 years old.         Minnie Evans, a folk artist whose vividly colored works were often inspired by dreams and religious visions, died Wednesday at the Grotgen Nursing Home in Wilmington, N.C. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Evans was a descendant of slaves brought to North Carolina in the early 19th century. She worked as a domestic for wealthy families in Wilmington and later as an admissions gatekeeper at the Airlie Gardens there.         She sometimes sold her works to visitors of the gardens. In the mid-1960's, a graduate art student, Nina Howell Starr, saw some of her works that had been bought by a friend and eventually arranged small exhibits of Mrs. Evans's work in New York City.         Mrs. Evans began to get wide recognition and by the 1970's, after more than 30 years of solitary work, she became one of the best known of black American folk artists. Her work was frequently shown in galleries and museums, most notably in a one-person show at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1975, and she was frequently written about. Her 'Lost Art'         From her childhood on, she often said, she had heard voices and seen visions, many of them influenced by the Bible. But it was not until she was in her early 40's that, in a torrent of creative expression that would last through the 1970's, she began to record the visions on paper.         ''The only thing I can tell you to say,'' she once told her friend and representative, Mrs. Starr, ''is that it's Minnie Evans's lost art. This has come to me, this art that I have put out, from nations that I suppose might have been destroyed before the flood. No one knows anything about them, but God has given it to me to bring them back into the world.''         With little money, she painted and drew on whatever was at hand - discarded windowshades, bookbindings, scrap paper. She favored vivid, almost psychedelic colors, which she achieved sometimes with oil paint but more often with inexpensive materials, especially ink and crayon. Angels, Devils and Beasts         The paintings were typically dense, lush patterns created by interlocking floral, human, animal and mythical forms. The angels, devils, beasts and Christ-like figures were clearly derived from biblical stories, while the vibrant and bursting foliage was inspired more by the Airlie Gardens.         ''I love people, to a certain extent,'' she told Newsweek in 1969. ''But sometimes I want to get off in the garden to talk with God. I have the blooms, and when the blooms are gone, I love to watch the green. God dressed the world in green.''         Mrs. Evans is survived by two sons, Elisha Dyer, of the Bronx, and George Sheldon, of Wilmington.

        Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         Edna Manley, a Caribbean artist and art patron and the widow of Jamaica's first Prime Minister and the mother of another, died Monday at her home, according to a family spokesman. She was 86 years old.         ''The information we have is that Mrs. Manley died last night in her sleep,'' the spokesman said, giving no cause of death.         Mrs. Manley was regarded as a major Caribbean and Latin American sculptor. At the same time, she was, as the wife of one of Jamaica's leading political figures, Norman Washington Manley, a major patron of the arts.         In colonial Jamaica as early as 1937 she fostered art with her own work and by teaching a generation of Jamaican artists.         She helped found Forum, a magazine in which young Caribbean poets and writers were often first published, and helped found the Jamaica Art School.         Her own sculpture earned her international recognition, including exhibitions in France and England.         Mrs. Manley was born Edna Swithenbank, in Hampshire, England, of a Jamaican mother and a British father. In 1921 she married her first cousin, a Rhodes scholar and lawyer who founded the People's National Party in Jamaica and helped lead his country to political independence in 1962. He died in 1969.         Mrs. Manley is survived by two sons: Michael, leader of the party his father founded and Jamaica's Prime Minister from 1972 to 1980, and Douglas, a social scientist who served in his brother's Cabinet.       
        Joan Greenwood, the husky-voiced British actress who starred in many film comedies and stage plays in the 1940's and 50's, has died at her home in London. She was 65 years old.         Joan Greenwood, the husky-voiced British actress who starred in many film comedies and stage plays in the 1940's and 50's, has died at her home in London. She was 65 years old.         Miss Greenwood's son, Jason Morrell, said his mother was found dead Saturday by friends she had invited to dinner. Mr. Morrell did not give a cause of his mother's death, but a BBC news report said she had apparently suffered a heart attack.         Miss Greenwood appeared on stage only two weeks ago in a sketch with Robert Morley at the Prince of Wales Theater in London. Mr. Morrell said his mother had not been ill recently.         Known primarily as a comic actress, Miss Greenwood starred in a series of British films in the 1940's and 50's that are now considered classics.         One of her frequent co-stars was Sir Alec Guinness, with whom she made ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' ''The Man in the White Suit'' and ''The Detective,'' a movie based on G. K. Chesterton's Father Brown books. In Film Version of 'Ernest'         Miss Greenwood also appeared with Michael Redgrave in the film version of Oscar Wilde's ''Importance of Being Ernest'' and with Basil Rathbone in ''Tight Little Island,'' a screen adaptation of Compton Mackenzie's novel ''Whiskey Galore.''         Miss Greenwood, born in the Chelsea section of London on March 4, 1921, was the daughter of Sydney Earnshaw Greenwood, an artist. She began taking dancing lessons when she was 8 years old, studied at St. Catherine's School in Surrey, and continued to take ballet lessons until she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art at 17.         Her first stage appearance came at age 18 when she appeared as Louisa in Moliere's ''Malade Imaginaire'' at the Apollo Theater in London. Performances in ''Little Ladyship'' and ''The Women'' followed.         Leslie Howard saw her in ''The Women'' and made Miss Greenwood his leading lady in the film ''The Gentle Sex.'' From then on Miss Greenwood alternated film and stage work.         She appeared in the role of Wendy in ''Peter Pan'' and as Elie Dunn in Shaw's ''Heartbreak House,'' then undertook more serious roles, playing Ophelia in ''Hamlet'' with the Donald Wolfit company, Nora in Ibsen's ''Doll House,'' Celia in ''Volpone'' and Sabina in ''The Young Wives' Tale.'' Developed a Following         Her film career rocketed with the success of ''Kind Hearts and Coronets,'' and Miss Greenwood gained a following on both sides of the Atlantic. She appeared on Broadway with Claude Rains in 1953 in T. S. Eliot's ''Confidential Clerk.''         Miss Greenwood's career had recently revived with appearances in several British television series. Her son said yesterday: ''She enjoyed doing all the recent TV work. She kept a trueness to herself. If she didn't want to do something, she wouldn't do it.''         Miss Greenwood was married in 1960 to the actor Andre Morrell, who died in 1978. She is survived by her son.         Correction:  March 19, 1987, Thursday, Late City Final Edition

        Margaret Israel, an artist whose mixed-media constructions and collages were highly praised for combining the fancy and innocence of folk art with a modern sophistication, was killed Wednesday in Manhattan in an accident while riding her bicycle. She was 57 years old.         Margaret Israel, an artist whose mixed-media constructions and collages were highly praised for combining the fancy and innocence of folk art with a modern sophistication, was killed Wednesday in Manhattan in an accident while riding her bicycle. She was 57 years old.         The artist died instantly when her bicycle collided with a tractor-trailer on West 23d Street at the intersection of 11th Avenue.         Mrs. Israel, working in a studio cluttered with bowls, boats, masks, and other curios and bits of city flotsam, produced drawings, paintings, terra-cotta figures, bamboo constructions and multimedia works of excellent craftmanship and poetic delicacy.         She first showed in New York at the Egan Gallery in 1961, and had regular shows throughout the 70's and 80's at the Cordier & Ekstrom Gallery on Madison Avenue.         ''She works on a bold scale, filling whole rooms with the objects of her imagination,'' Hilton Kramer wrote in The New York Times in 1978. Studied in Paris         A native of Cuba, Mrs. Israel came to the United States as an infant. She attended Syracuse University in Syracuse, N.Y., and later studied art at several institutions in Paris, including the Ecole des Beaux Arts, the Academie de la Grande Chaumiere and Atelier 17.         In an interview with The New York Times in 1979, Mrs. Israel said: ''My work is decorative, in the sense that I intend it to reach you very quickly, on a level of pure enjoyment. And I use familiar themes because it's an easy way to communicate with people. I think of it all as a journey where the adventure lies in seeing how one thing works with another.''         To collectors, friends and associates in the art world, Mrs. Israel was known for an energy, an enthusiasm and an iconoclasm that matched her art.         Mrs. Israel's husband, Marvin, died in 1984. She is survived by her mother, Margaret Ponce, and a sister.       
        Hannelore Baron, an artist known for her collages and box assemblages, died of cancer Tuesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 61 years old and lived in Riverdale.         Hannelore Baron, an artist known for her collages and box assemblages, died of cancer Tuesday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 61 years old and lived in Riverdale.         Ms. Baron escaped Nazi Germany with her parents, and her work is marked by the gravity, discretion and understated wit of a survivor. She had a special feeling for paper, for the weight of communication it can bear and the weight of history that settles so easily on its edges and surfaces.         She described herself a pacifist and wanted her quietly intense work to convince others of the need to listen. She used letters as symbols of memory and birds as symbols of vulnerability and the need for song.         She had numerous solo shows in New York and last summer was a participant in ''Jewish Themes - Contemporary Artists II'' at the Jewish Museum.         Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the National Museum of American Art and the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo, N.Y.         She is survived by her husband, Herman; a son, Mark; a daughter, Julie; a brother, Hans, and two grandchildren.
