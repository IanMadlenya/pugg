         Diana Adams, who was a leading ballerina with both the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater and the former dean of students at the School of American Ballet, died on Sunday at Mark Twain-St. Joseph's Hospital in San Andreas, Calif. She was 66 and lived in Arnold, Calif.         Miss Adams was one of George Balanchine's favorite dancers and created roles in many of his major ballets of the 1950's. Among her most complex parts was the almost fiendishly demanding pas de deux she danced with Arthur Mitchell in the Balanchine-Stravinsky "Agon" in 1957. Mr. Mitchell later said of the duet and its unusual pivots and balances, "Diana's nervous intensity made the whole pas de deux work because it's not so much the difficulty of the steps or how flexible you are, it's the precariousness."         She also appeared in films, performing with Danny Kaye in "Knock on Wood" (1954) and in "Invitation to the Dance" (1956), directed by Gene Kelly. A Versatile Talent         Miss Adams was born in Staunton, Va. Her family later moved to New York City, and she studied there at Ballet Arts School, where one of her teachers was Agnes de Mille. Miss Adams made her stage debut in 1943 in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Oklahoma!," choreographed by Miss de Mille. In 1944, she joined Ballet Theater, as American Ballet Theater was then known.         Her talent and versatility were soon recognized. She performed the title role in David Lichine's comic "Helen of Troy," was the malevolent Queen of the Wilis in "Giselle," and was praised for her poignancy in Antony Tudor's bittersweet "Jardin aux Lilas" and for her ferocity in "Undertow," Tudor's ballet about slum life. In 1948, she created the role of the mother in Miss de Mille's "Fall River Legend."         She joined the New York City Ballet in 1950 and performed with it until 1963. She had a remarkable interpretative range and was as compelling in Balanchine'sabstractions as she was in Tudor's dance-dramas. John Martin wrote in The New York Times in 1951 that under Balanchine's guidance, Miss Adams "has become theepitome of the lyric dancer."         In addition to "Agon," she danced leading roles in the premieres of Tudor's "Lady of the Camellias" (1951), Frederick Ashton's "Picnic at Tintagel" (1952), and important Balanchine creations including "Caracole" (1952), "Opus 34" (1954), "Episodes" (1959) and "Liebeslieder Walzer" (1960). Transition Into Teaching         She began teaching at the School of American Ballet while still a member of the company. After she stopped dancing, she served as dean of students at Balanchine's request until she retired in 1971. It was Miss Adams who chose the teen-age Suzanne Farrell at a School of American Ballet audition in 1960.         Miss Adams married the dancer Hugh Laing in 1947; they were divorced in 1953. Her second marriage, to the stage manager and lighting designer Ronald Bates, also ended in divorce. In recent years, Miss Adams lived quietly in retirement, although she did teach for several companies, including the State Ballet of Missouri, which is directed by Todd Bolender, one of her former colleagues at the New York City Ballet.         She is survived by a daughter, Georgina Bates of Antioch, Calif.       
         Mary Lazar, the wife of the literary and talent agent Irving P. (Swifty) Lazar, died last Thursday in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 60.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Lazar was born in Aurora, Ill. She began her career as a model, and appeared in advertisements as a "Coca-Cola girl." She later headed her own television and motion picture production company, Juno Productions, and worked in the development department of Telepictures Productions. From 1988 to 1991 she was a West Coast editor for Simon & Schuster.         In addition to her husband, with whom she shared homes in Beverly Hills, Manhattan and Southampton, L.I., she is survived by two sisters, Anita Rosenow of Boulder, Colo., and Holly Benfer of Norco, Calif.       
         Cynthia Wood, a horse breeder and patron of the arts, died on Saturday at her ranch in Santa Barbara. She was 55.         She died of cancer, said Merrillee Ford, a friend of the family.         Ms. Wood grew up on a working ranch in the Simi Valley, where her father, Adrian Gordon (Buddy) Wood, was a rancher, philanthropist, cultural leader and powerful figure in county politics. In 1968 she built showplace stables on a 22-acre property where she bred, trained and showed thoroughbred horses. She sold the property in 1983.         In her youth, Ms. Wood studied singing in the West and at the Metropolitan Opera. She worked for a time as an assistant stage manager at La Scala in Milan, Italy, and as an assistant to several opera directors.         She was the founding president of the Friends of the Vienna Philharmonic and served on the boards of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Community Arts Music Association of Santa Barbara.         She joined the Metropolitan Opera board in 1989. Her gifts to the company included new productions of "Parsifal," "Elektra" and "Lucia di Lammermoor"; the 1990 telecast of Wagner's "Ring" cycle, and underwriting for future new productions. The public television broadcast of "Parsifal" scheduled for April 7 is also one of her gifts.         She is survived by her mother, Ailene Claeyssens of Santa Barbara.       
         Eren Ozker, an actress and a puppeteer with the Muppets, died on Thursday at her home in New York City. She was 44 and also kept a home in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, William Bogert.         Ms. Ozker (pronounced Oscar) was born in Ankara, Turkey, and grew up in Farmington Hills, Mich. After receiving a bachelor's degree in drama from the University of Michigan in 1970, she moved to New York and performed in Off Broadway productions at the Roundabout Theater, the Public Theater and the New Dramatists Guild. In 1975 she joined the Hartman Theater Company in Stamford, Conn., where she took the role of Marya in the theater's first production, "The Government Inspector," and met her husband, also an actor.         In 1976 Ms. Ozker joined the cast of "The Muppet Show," which was beginning its first season. She played the roles of Hilda, the wardrobe lady, and Wanda, an accident-prone vaudeville singer. She also performed in "The Muppet Movie" and "Emmett Otter's Jug Band Christmas," a television special produced by Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets.         In 1989, convinced that puppeteers required their own voice in the acting profession, she founded the Puppeteers Caucus, a working group within the Screen Actors Guild, and was its first chairwoman. In 1991, the guild presented her its Joseph C. Riley Award for outstanding service to the union.         In 1988 she appeared for the last time as a puppeteer in "The Warrior Ant" at the Next Wave Festival in Brooklyn.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by four sisters: Denise, of Brooklyn; Peri, of Newtonville, Mass.; Shawn, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Suzan, of Pompano Beach, Fla.       
         Enid Britten-Stux, who danced with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Ballet de Lyons, died on Jan. 22 at her home in Manhattan. She was 46.         Her brother-in-law, Stefan Stux, said the cause of death was a brain hemorrhage.         Ms. Britten was best known for her work in the mid-1970's with the Ailey company; she stood out for the emotional range of her dancing. Her repertory included the Eve figure in John Butler's "After Eden" and a doomed young lover in Talley Beatty's "Road of the Phoebe Snow," for which she was singled out for the understated, contained quality of her dancing and the driven physicality of the character's panic. She was also praised for her portrayal of Mahalia Jackson in "The Mooche," choreographed by Ailey.         She is survived by her husband, Ivan Stux; her mother, Rosa Aytch of Philadelphia; two sisters, and a brother.       
         Sydelle Stephany Reisman, owner of the Westport (Conn.) Research Group and active in civic affairs in Westport, died on Wednesday in Norwalk Hospital. She was 65 and had homes in Westport and Carefree, Ariz.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         Mrs. Reisman, known as Syd, was born in New York City, graduated from New York University and held a master's degree in library science from Southern Connecticut State College. She was on the Westport Public Library staff before founding her company in 1985, providing computerized information to clients.         She is survived by her husband, Bert M.; two daughters, Robin Lee Reisman of Manhattan and Jodie Sue Reisman of Wilton, Conn.; a son, Michael J. of Manhattan; and a sister, Irene Topolcic of Virginia Beach, Va.       
         Lillian Gish, the last of the great silent film stars, who performed for more than 85 years in movies, theater and television, died in her sleep on Saturday evening at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.         Her personal manager, James E. Frasher, said the cause was heart failure.         "She was the same age as film," Mr. Frasher said. "They both came into the world in 1893."         Miss Gish was still performing as recently as the late 1980's. In 1986, she appeared as Alan Alda's hilariously addled mother in "Sweet Liberty," and in 1987 she was widely praised for her sensitive portrayal of an indomitable old woman in "The Whales of August," which co-starred another movie legend, Bette Davis.  Advocate of an Early Start         "To become an actress, one cannot begin too soon," said Miss Gish, and she meant it, for she had made her acting debut at the age of 5.         Under the guidance of the director D. W. Griffith, Miss Gish became the pre-eminent actress in silent films, appearing in classics like "The Birth of a Nation," "Intolerance," "Broken Blossoms" and "Way Down East."         After performing in dozens of one- and two-reel silent movies (with running times of 10 or 20 minutes) and then in the longer Griffith epics, Miss Gish made a successful transition to the "talkies," and later into television.         Between film and television roles, she also worked on the stage. In 1930 she starred as Helena in Jed Harris's Broadway production of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," and in 1973 she appeared as the nurse in Mike Nichols's revival of the play. She made her last Broadway appearance in 1975, in "A Musical Jubilee."         Especially in her youth, Miss Gish evoked an aura of fragility, and hers was a vulnerable waiflike beauty. The renowned theatrical impresario David Belasco pronounced her "the most beautiful blonde I have ever seen." George Jean Nathan, the Broadway critic who courted Miss Gish without success for more than a decade, compared her to Eleonora Duse.         Miss Gish, though not always in excellent health, was accustomed to hard work and took a no-nonsense view of her physical attributes.         "I didn't care about being a beauty," she said in an interview in 1975. "I wanted to be an actress. When I was in the movies, I didn't care what I looked like, except for that image up there on the screen. I wanted to create beauty when it was necessary; that's an inner thing. But if all you have is a facade, it isn't interesting."         Throughout her life Miss Gish remained singularly devoted to her mother and to her sister, Dorothy, who was younger, but who became an actress at about the same time Lillian did. Mrs. Gish died in 1948 after a long invalidism, and Dorothy Gish died in 1968.         Miss Gish, who never married and who leaves no survivors, finally rejected Mr. Nathan's long series of marriage proposals, and said that a primary reason was his "seeming resentment" of her devotion to her family. She gave another reason for staying single: "Actresses have no business marrying. I always felt that being a successful wife was a 24-hour-a-day job. Besides, I knew such charming men: perhaps I didn't want to disillusion any of them."         Lillian Diana Gish, a daughter of the former Mary Robinson McConnell and James Gish, was born on Oct. 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio. The family moved to Baltimore, where Mr. Gish became a partner in a candy store. Before the turn of the century, he abandoned his wife and two daughters. He died in 1911.         Mrs. Gish took her daughters to New York City, rented an apartment on West 34th Street that was large enough to include two boarders, and began working in a department store. When Lillian was 5, a Gish boarder, an actress named Alice Niles, persuaded Mrs. Gish to let her take the child with her to act in a production of "In Convict's Stripes," which played one-night stands across the country. Lillian's salary was $10 a week.         At the age of 4, Dorothy joined another touring troupe; so did Mrs. Gish. The Gishes were separated at least half of each year, and life was lonely for Lillian as she traveled constantly and shared squalid hotel rooms with other company members to save money. More than once, she nearly fell into the hands of Elbridge Gerry's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which was dedicated to protecting children who worked in sweatshop factories as well as on the stage.         When the Gishes were together in New York, they shared quarters with Charlotte Smith, whose daughter Gladys was a bit player on Broadway. Lillian won the role of a dancer, a part that Gladys had hoped for, in Sarah Bernhardt's 1905 engagement on Broadway. She Knew Pickford As Gladys Smith         In 1909, while visiting friends in Baltimore, Lillian and Dorothy dropped in to see a short film called "Lena and the Geese," and immediately recognized its star as Gladys Smith. The next year the sisters showed up at the Biograph film studios in Manhattan, at 11 East 14th Street, and asked to see Miss Smith.         That very day Gladys Smith, who had changed her name to Mary Pickford, introduced the Gishes to D. W. Griffith, who at that time was churning out at least three one-reelers a week for Biograph.         He took the sisters to a rehearsal hall, where he produced a revolver and began to shoot over their heads. He later explained that he wanted to see how they reacted. They evidently passed the fear test, for within hours they were playing small roles in "An Unseen Enemy." Each received $5.         That was the beginning of an artistic collaboration between Lillian Gish and Griffith that lasted more than a decade. During that time Miss Gish appeared in dozens of Griffith's short films and starred in most of his critically and economically successful longer ones.         In some films she played bit parts; in others, she played several roles. Sometimes she was the star. All of Griffith's Biograph actors were moved around in this way: it was not until after the success of "The Birth of a Nation" that any received on-screen credit. One Source of Pride: Doing Own Stunts         Miss Gish was proud of the fact that she became an accomplished horseback rider, and performed her own stunts in dangerous scenes. She also learned to edit film, set up lights and pick costumes, and she directed two films for Biograph, one of which starred her sister, Dorothy.         During most of her years with Griffith, Miss Gish and the rest of the Griffith company of actors and technicians divided their time between New York and Los Angeles. In 1913, when Griffith joined Mutual Productions, Miss Gish, her sister and many other artists at Biograph moved with him. Miss Gish starred in his first Mutual film, "The Battle of the Sexes," in 1914.         Securing financial backing for "The Birth of a Nation," a Civil War epic and a milestone in the history of the motion picture, was a major battle for Griffith, for the movie's costs constantly outstripped the budget estimates. It was said to have cost $300,000.         First released in February 1915, under the title "The Clansman," the film ran an unheard-of two hours and was shown at first in only a handful of road-show theaters, to the musical accompaniment of a 30-piece orchestra. Customers paid $2 to see what soon became known as "The Birth of a Nation." Despite the high admission price, the picture was a great hit.         "In it I played Elsie, the sweet and virginal daughter of the family around which the action was built," Miss Gish said in 1975. "I played so many frail, downtrodden little virgins in the films of my youth that I sometimes think I invented that stereotype of a role."         Miss Gish's role in Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916) was small. Griffith had envisioned the film as his ultimate contribution to the motion-picture art, but he was forced to trim it drastically on the insistence of his creditors. Many other stars of the day, including Constance Talmadge, Bessie Love and Erich von Stroheim, made brief appearances.  Propaganda Films For World War I         During World War I, the Gish sisters went with Griffith to Europe to make propaganda films, among them the immensely successful "Hearts of the World" (1918). By that time, Griffith had joined Adolph Zukor's company, which later became Paramount Pictures.         Hendrick Sartov, the still photographer for "Hearts of the World," eventually became a cinematographer for Griffith and invented for Miss Gish the "Lillian Gish lens," now called a soft-focus lens, which gives its subject a warmly blurred appearance.         In the fall of 1919, Griffith moved his entire company to Mamaroneck, N.Y., where he built his own movie studio on a huge estate. It was there, and on locations in New England, that he filmed Miss Gish's popular melodrama "Way Down East," released in 1920.         Miss Gish wrote in her autobiography that she volunteered to perform the dangerous climactic scene in that film, in which the heroine, lying on the ice floe in a freezing river, is headed for almost certain doom over a waterfall.         The frail-looking Miss Gish lay on the floe, her hair and one of her hands trailing in the frigid water. "My face was caked with a crust of snow and ice, and little spikes formed on my eyelashes, making it difficult to keep my eyes open," she recalled. "It was a delicious scene, one of my really favorites, but I remember being cold for days afterward."         "Orphans of the Storm," a French-Revolution melodrama released in 1922, was Griffith's last financially successful picture and, perhaps not coincidentally, the last Miss Gish made for him. "With all the expenses I have, I can't afford to pay you what you're worth," he told her. "You should go out on your own."         With heavy investments of her own money, she then made two successful movies in Italy, "The White Sister" and "Romola."         In the mid-1920's Miss Gish became embroiled in a long legal battle with Charles Duell, a socialite who had been her financial adviser (and, as she said in 1975, "sort of my Svengali"), over sums he claimed she owed him. Miss Gish munched carrots during the trial, and newspaper photographs of her stirred a carrot-chomping fad across the country.         Americans had become enchanted with the new artistic aristocracy, made up of movie stars like Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino and Miss Gish. Earlier, in a movie, when Miss Gish had pushed up the sides of her mouth with her fingers to demonstrate feigned happiness, the gesture became a much-copied fad. From the Silents To the Talkies         Miss Gish made the transition from silents to talkies in 1930 in "One Romantic Night," with Rod LaRocque and Conrad Nagel. By that time, she had signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. "My contract called for six pictures in two years, for which I was paid, I believe, a million dollars," she wrote.         Miss Gish made a triumphant return to the stage in 1930 in "Uncle Vanya" on Broadway. In 1936 she played Ophelia to John Gielgud's Hamlet and Judith Anderson's Queen Gertrude, and in 1941 she began a record-breaking 66-week run in "Life With Father" in Chicago. In 1960, she starred in "All the Way Home" on Broadway.         As Miss Gish grew older, roles were more difficult to come by, but she played in summer stock and in an occasional movie, like "The Comedians," "The Night of the Hunter" and "The Undefeated." An early recruit to television, she appeared in "Arsenic and Old Lace" with Helen Hayes and in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful."         Commenting on what was to be Miss Gish's last screen performance, in the 1987 "Whales of August," Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times: "There's not a gesture or a line-reading that doesn't reflect her nearly three-quarters of a century in front of a camera. Scenes are not purloined when she's on screen."         Correction:  March 2, 1993, Tuesday         A picture in some copies yesterday with an obituary of Lillian Gish, showing a scene from "Life With Father," was published in error. It showed Dorothy Gish.       
         Mildred Collins, president of Mildred Collins Inc., a Manhattan-based sales promotion and publicity company, died on Sunday at Tisch Hospital at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         Before founding her business in 1969, Miss Collins was vice president of sales promotion for the Stern Brothers department store chain, a division of the Allied Stores Corporation.         Miss Collins worked on a number of film promotions, among them "The Great Gatsby" in 1974, "Murder On the Orient Express" in 1974 and "Death on the Nile" in 1978.         She was born in St. Petersburg, Fla., and graduated from Wesleyan College in 1945. She began work with the Rich's department store chain in Atlanta, and became the head of its radio school. In 1948, the Association of the Junior Leagues of America brought her to New York as coordinator of its radio and television program. She then joined Stern's, where she was one of Allied's first women executives.         Miss Collins is survived by two sisters, Elsie Jenkins of St. Petersburg and Mary Collins of Manhattan, and several nieces and nephews.       
         Helen Hayes, the tiny actress whose big-hearted portrayals of Queen Victoria and other regal women helped make her one of the century's best-loved stars, died yesterday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 92 and lived in Nyack.         The cause was heart failure, said John Springer, her longtime press agent and friend. Miss Hayes was admitted to the hospital on March 9 suffering from congestive heart failure and irregular heartbeat.         The human warmth and masterly acting technique that Miss Hayes brought to the stage and screen earned her many triumphs in her long career. She was one of the three great women of the American theater, with Katharine Cornell and Lynn Fontanne, in its glory days of the 1920's and 30's. Lights Dimmed on Broadway         In tribute to the actress, who was often called the First Lady of the American theater, Broadway marquees were dimmed for one minute last night at 8 P.M.         Miss Hayes's greatest stage success was the 1935 drama "Victoria Regina," in which she played the long-lived British monarch from girlhood to widowhood, aging visibly from act to act thanks to the makeup artist's skill, and her own.         Her other stage triumphs included the title roles in "Mary of Scotland" (1933) and "Harriet" (1943), about Harriet Beecher Stowe. Her first great success was in "Coquette" in 1927, and her last was in the 1970 revival of "Harvey."         Miss Hayes won an Academy Award for best actress for her first major film role, in "The Sin of Madelon Claudet" (1931). She went on to star in screen hits including "Arrowsmith" (1931) opposite Ronald Colman, "A Farewell to Arms" (1932) with Gary Cooper, and "Night Flight" (1933), in which she joined John Barrymore in an all-star cast. In 1971 she won a second Oscar, as best supporting actress, for "Airport."         With her bright eyes and elfin smile, Miss Hayes's looks were highly winsome, and through sheer grace and stagecraft she was able to convey an impression of downright beauty when she chose. Although she was only 5 feet tall and weighed a mere 100 pounds, she could also create an aura of strength and weight and splendor if a role required one.         "Tremulously magnificent" was the way Brooks Atkinson, as drama critic of The New York Times, described her opening-night performance in "Victoria Regina." "Since the Queen is dead, God rest her soul," he wrote, "let the cheers go to her actress, who deserves all the homage the town contains."         And audiences did cheer, again and again over the years, partly because of Miss Hayes's skill and versatility -- she performed comedy and drama with equal skill -- and partly because her warmheartedness always put them on her side. An Active Role In Public Life         Once Miss Hayes was established as a great star, she threw herself into many areas of public life. She was president of the American Theater Wing and the American National Theater and Academy and was the national chairwoman of women's activities for the March of Dimes. She was brought up in the Roman Catholic Church, was denied its sacraments after marrying the playwright Charles MacArthur -- who had been divorced -- and returned to the church after his death in 1956. In 1979, she received an award from the Catholic Interracial Council of New York for her work "to combat racial and religious bigotry and discrimination in our society."         Her own view of her success and eminence was modest. "Without the compensation of glamour, I am hard put to explain the durability of my career and the loyalty of the audience," she wrote in "On Reflection," a volume of memoirs published in 1968.         "Perhaps it is just identification," she went on. "I was once the typical daughter, then the easily recognizable wife, and then the quintessential mother. I seem always to have reminded people of someone in their family. Perhaps I am just the triumph of Plain Jane." Hard Work And Unworldliness         Hers was also a triumph of hard work. Over the years she became the consummate theater professional, literally down to her toes: early in her career she had a nervous habit of making her body rigid when she felt insecure onstage, but she eventually trained herself to work off her tension less conspicuously, by simply curling her toes.         Even after she became well known, Miss Hayes remained somewhat unsophisticated and shy in private, although her husband was a high-living sophisticate who cut a dashing figure in cafe society.         When she was in her late 20's and already a stage veteran, the producer Jed Harris remarked after talking to her that she was ignorant, but he later said admiringly that "as an actress, her instinct was always perfect."         Miss Hayes liked to tell stories about her own unworldliness. There was the time, for instance, when her husband took her to call on the writer Gertrude Stein and Miss Stein's friend Alice B. Toklas in their Paris home. Although the walls were decorated with fine paintings, Miss Hayes later recalled, "Nothing impressed me more than Alice B. Toklas's mustache."         One long-ago day in Hollywood, as Miss Hayes told it, Clark Gable sent her "a mash note" -- evidently inviting her to an assignation -- but she ignored it. Years later he went backstage to see her, gave a dimpled smile and said, "You were too shy, weren't you, Helen?"         Simplicity and virtue were Miss Hayes's by birthright, along with a yearning for the stage. Helen Hayes Brown was born on Oct. 10, 1900, in Washington, the only child of Francis Van Arnum Brown, a pork and poultry salesman, and Catherine Estelle Hayes Brown, a sometime actress who remained stagestruck all her life. Catherine Brown was a great-niece of an Irish-born singer, Catherine Hayes, who was known as "the Swan of Erin" in California in the Gold Rush days.         Helen did her first acting barely after her days as a toddler, when she was known in her family as "the white mouse." It was a part in "A Midsummer Night's Dream" at the Holy Cross Academy, a Washington school that emphasized theatricals. She also did some singing at galas organized by her dancing school, Miss Minnie Hawke's School of Dance. When she was 6 years old, Lew Fields, a producer and star of musical comedies, heard one of her singing performances and was impressed.         Mrs. Brown was delighted to encourage her daughter as a performer, and soon afterward Helen made her professional stage debut in a local stock production of "The Prince Chap." She also appeared in summer stock in subsequent years. Meeting Destiny At the Age of 8         Deciding that her daughter was destined for an upper-crust life, Mrs. Brown took in washing to pay for French lessons to supplement the curriculum of the Sacred Heart Academy in Washington, where Helen was enrolled. Thus prepared, mother and daughter, then 8 years old, took the train to New York and waited outside Mr. Fields's office. Then destiny beckoned: he emerged, remembered Helen and signed her for a principal role in Victor Herbert's "Old Dutch" at the old Herald Square Theater.         She went on to appear in several other stage productions overseen by Mr. Fields, and she began her film career in an early "quickie," "Jean and the Calico Doll," made in the old Vitagraph Studio in Brooklyn.         At the age of 13 she was hired to perform with the renowned John Drew in a romantic comedy, "The Prodigal Husband," produced by Charles Frohman, which opened in 1914 at the old Empire Theater at 40th Street and Broadway. The play was undistinguished, but Miss Hayes shone.         Mr. Frohman, one of the titans of the theater, went down with the Lusitania in 1915 and so was not able to quash the false rumors -- which circulated for years -- that Miss Hayes was actually his illegitimate daughter by Maude Adams, a stage star of the day. "No one knows where these canards get their start," Miss Hayes wrote in "On Reflection." "I only know that they are hard to finish off."         After graduating from the Sacred Heart Academy back in Washington, she went on at the age of 20 to win her first star billing, for her part as a flapper in the play "Bab," which opened in New York in 1920. But as she later recalled, "On opening night, I gave one of those shrill, tense performances that became a hazard in my career whenever I was not in top form."         She was crushed when the reviewer Heywood Broun criticized her acting, dismissing her as "cute," which is what the critics kept calling her for years. A columnist once said she suffered from "fallen archness."         To forestall such complaints, Miss Hayes worked hard at improving her voice and delivery and tried to make her performances consistent. She also worked hard at seeming taller. "My posture became military," she later recalled. "I became the tallest five-foot woman in the world."         By the mid-20's, she was highly popular as a light comedian, despite critical ups and downs, and she caught the eye of Mr. Harris, the producer, with her poignant performance in the 1926 revival of the James M. Barrie comedy "What Every Woman Knows."         Years later, Mr. Harris reported, "Her subtlety and power astounded me; I thought she could do anything." He chose her for the leading role in the 1927 play "Coquette," about a well-born Southern girl, made pregnant by a hillbilly, who kills herself. Other theater people had doubts about casting Miss Hayes in the part, but when the curtain rang down on opening night, she received thunderous applause.         "I have never seen anything quite like the ovation Miss Hayes received that night," Mr. Harris said later. After 16 curtain calls, "the applause was still as strong and solid as it had been when the curtain fell."  Emeralds, Peanuts And a Lifelong Love         It was in a glittering New York salon that Miss Hayes, still rather shy, met Mr. MacArthur. In her best-selling 1990 autobiography, "My Life in Three Acts," written with Katherine Hatch, she recalled: "I picked up a glass of sherry to fit in and retreated to a secluded niche. Twenty minutes later, a good-looking fellow with curly brown hair and sparkling green eyes came over, maybe because he felt sorry for me sitting there all alone. He held out a small paper bag. 'Wanna peanut?' he asked. 'Thanks,' I said. He poured a few in my hand and said, 'I wish they were emeralds.' Right then and there I fell in love."         (That story was told so often in later years that he once said, "There ought to be a statute of limitations on lovelorn remarks." And in 1945, returning from a sojourn in India, he dropped a sack of emeralds in her lap and said, "I wish they were peanuts.")         The complex courtship that ensued -- Mr. MacArthur was married at the time -- came to a suspenseful culmination on the summer night in 1928 when his raffish play of newspaper life, "The Front Page," opened in New York. Miss Hayes was still appearing in "Coquette," but Mr. Harris closed the show for that day so she could watch the first night of "The Front Page."         "I was nervous," Miss Hayes recalled years later. "I knew Charlie wouldn't marry me unless he had a hit."         She took a seat in the balcony while the nervous Mr. MacArthur and his co-author, Ben Hecht, sat on a fire escape outside.         "A few minutes into the first act I knew we were in," Miss Hayes wrote in "My Life." "The Tribune critic was chuckling and pounding his companion on the back. The audience was breaking up with laughter. I ran to the fire escape and shouted, 'It's a hit!' Whereupon Charlie opened his arms and asked, 'Will you marry me, Helen?' "         Soon afterward his divorce came through, they wed (Harpo Marx sent the bride a Steinway piano crate filled with gardenias) and in all the rest of her life, Miss Hayes wrote, "I never loved another man."         Miss Hayes gave birth to her daughter, Mary, in February 1930. Later that year she acted in "Mr. Gilhooley," a flop, and "Petticoat Influence," which was only a moderate success, as was "The Good Fairy" in 1931.         Then Miss Hayes acted in her first Hollywood film, "The Sin of Madelon Claudet," a sob story that was notably teary even by Hollywood standards. She played Madelon, a woman who made degrading sacrifices so that her illegitimate son could become a doctor. Her First Queen: 'Mary of Scotland'         When Miss Hayes returned to Broadway in "Mary of Scotland," she was such a box-office draw that for many months it was difficult to buy tickets; the Maxwell Anderson drama, about the 16th-century Mary Queen of Scots, was a tremendous hit. Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times: "Slight as she is in stature (and Mary was six feet tall), Miss Hayes raises herself to queendom by the transcendence of her spirit."         She did even better in "Victoria Regina." Mr. Atkinson said her ability "to encompass in one evening the youth, maturity and venerability of one human being" was "a humbling personal triumph."         After some disappointing roles, Miss Hayes was again the toast of Broadway in "Harriet." She also won praise for her acting in Anita Loos's robustly commercial "Happy Birthday" (1946), and, after appearing in Josh Logan's disappointing "Wisteria Trees" (1950), she came back strong in Mary Chase's farce "Mrs. McThing" (1952) and also won praise for her part in the revival of Thornton Wilder's "Skin of Our Teeth" that opened at the ANTA Theater (now the Virginia) in 1955.         In her later years, she appeared on television and undertook repertory with the APA-Phoenix company in works ranging from Sheridan to Pirandello to George Kelly. She also had parts in several Walt Disney films, including "One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing" (1975).         In "My Life" Miss Hayes recalled deciding to retire from the stage in 1972, while she was performing in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" in Washington. "My career had begun in Washington and it would end there," she wrote. "I liked the idea of a circle being completed." An Epitaph Written Onstage         Her stage career also inspired another valedictory touch. In 1990 she told an audience of female journalists in Hollywood about a scene in "Victoria Regina" in which a tough-looking man bursts through a police line at Queen Victoria's 90th-birthday celebration and yells: "Go it, old girl. You've done well."         Miss Hayes told the journalists, "I've always meant, since I heard that line, to have it put on my tombstone."         Along with her achievements, Miss Hayes had great sadnesses in her life. Her daughter, Mary, a novice actress, died of polio in 1949, and Miss Hayes then spoke and wrote movingly of her grief. In her 1990 book she wrote that her own husband, Mr. MacArthur, "set about killing himself" with drink after Mary's death. "It took seven years," Miss Hayes wrote, "and it was harrowing to watch."         Earlier, in 1938, Miss Hayes and her husband adopted a son, James MacArthur, when he was 7 months old. He grew up to be a television actor, best known for the series "Hawaii Five-O." She is survived by Mr. MacArthur, of Palm Desert, Calif., and three grandchildren.         During her career, Miss Hayes received Emmy, Tony and other awards for her stage performances, and honorary degrees from Smith College, Princeton, Columbia and Fordham Universities and other institutions. President Reagan and his wife, Nancy, presented her with the nation's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1986. She was also a recipient of the Kennedy Center Honors in 1981.         Miss Hayes was further honored by having various institutions and programs named for her, notably the annual Helen Hayes Awards, given for artistic achievement in the professional theater in Washington, and the Helen Hayes Theater in Manhattan. In 1955, the Fulton Theater on West 46th Street was named in her honor. When that theater, along with the Morosco, was torn down in 1982 to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel, angering many theater professionals and preservationists, Miss Hayes declined the hotel developers' request to name the new theater within the hotel for her. Instead, the Little Theater, an older theater on West 44th Street, was renamed the Helen Hayes. Performances Of a Lifetime         In more than 60 years on stage and screen, Helen Hayes tried her hand at a constellation of roles, playing flappers and flibbertigibbets, matrons and monarchs. Here is a selected list of her credits.

         Joyce Carey, a British stage actress known for her performances in plays by Noel Coward, died on Feb. 28 at a London hospital. She was 94 and lived in London.         Miss Carey came from a theatrical family. Her mother, Lilian Braithwaite, was a star on the London stage, and her father, Gerald Lawrence, was a matinee idol who began his acting career as a juvenile in the company of Sir Henry Irving. In 1916, Miss Carey appeared as Princess Katherine in an all-female production of "Henry V." She made her professional debut in a revival of "Mr. Wu" and went on to play ingenue roles. In the 1920's she appeared in numerous Shakespeare plays and drawing-room comedies.         Miss Carey first met Coward, the dominant artistic influence on her career, at a dress rehearsal for his play "The Vortex" in 1924, when she went backstage to compliment the cast. When Coward's "Easy Virtue" opened in New York the next year, Miss Carey played a leading role, which she repeated when the show went to London.         In 1927 she appeared on Broadway in "The Road to Rome," and she spent the next seven years acting on the New York stage. She returned to London to perform in Coward's "Tonight at 8:30," and went on to act in a string of Coward plays over the next two decades, including "Present Laughter," "This Happy Breed," "Quadrille" and "Nude With Violin." She also appeared in several Coward films, among them "In Which We Serve," "Blithe Spirit," "The Astonished Heart" and, most memorably, as the manager of the train-station buffet in "Brief Encounter." Her other films included "The Way to the Stars" and "Cry, the Beloved Country." Nom de Plume         In 1934 she took a small role in "Sweet Aloes," a comedy about a young woman who has a trouble-filled affair with a nobleman. The author, listed as Jay Mallory, was in fact Miss Carey. The play ran for more than a year.         As she grew older, Miss Carey made a specialty of foolish aunts, disgruntled widows and elderly aristocrats, notably in Oscar Wilde's "Importance of Being Earnest" and "Ideal Husband.".         Miss Carey, who never married, continued acting on the stage right through her 80's, appearing with Peter O'Toole in Shaw's "Man and Superman" and "Pygmalion." At 90, she played an elderly lady facing eviction in "No. 27," a BBC play written by Michael Palin. She also made one of her final stage appearances in the rarely performed Coward comedy "Semi-Monde."         Miss Carey was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1982.       
         Irene Claire Fromer, a retired teacher and artist, died on Tuesday at Doctors Hospital on Staten Island. She was 70 and lived on Staten Island and in St. Croix, V.I.         Her death was a result of a myocardial flu virus, said her husband of nearly 50 years, Dr. Stephen Fromer.         Mrs. Fromer, a graduate of Hunter College, earned a master's degree at Columbia University with a thesis on Herman Melville and the industrial revolution. She taught in the public schools and at one time worked for Merck & Company, writing abstracts on new drugs.         She was an expert in Haitian art and had some of her own work -- paintings, collages and sculptures -- shown at several exhibitions. Together with her husband, she worked at Medical Consultants V.I. in St. Croix, advising doctors on office management.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Fromer is survived by a son, Dr. Carl H., of Staten Island; a daughter, Dr. Sandra A. Stingle of Manhattan; her mother, Bella Siegel of Staten Island; a brother, Jack Siegel of New Rochelle, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Judith Rothschild, an abstract painter whose works were shown internationally and who left a multi-million-dollar estate to support contemporary American artists, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan and in Wellfleet, Mass.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Ms. Rothschild painted for 55 years, beginning as a teen-ager. Her works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Gallery in Washington and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., among others.         Her works were exhibited in many group shows and in several one-woman shows, including the first devoted to an American artist by the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, in 1991. Legacy to Museums and Artists         Ms. Rothschild left a collection that included her paintings and major works by Mondrian, Matisse, Brancusi, Gris and Picasso. The estate could bring up to $40 million, said its executor, Erik Stapper, and Harvey Miller, the trustee of the Judith Rothschild Foundation.         Under her will, the proceeds are to be used to foster art by helping public galleries and museums buy works of contemporary American artists over the next 25 years.         Ms. Rothschild was a founder and president of the American Abstract Artists Association. She also served on the boards of the American Federation of Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the New York Studio School and the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center.         A longtime colleague of Robert Motherwell, she joined him and a few other artists in forming a cooperative, the Long Point Gallery, in Provincetown on Cape Cod. A Youthful Talent         Ms. Rothschild displayed a flair for art as a youngster. Because of her interests, her parents began collecting art, including some of the major pieces now part of her estate. Her father, Herbert, owned a furniture manufacturing company.         Ms. Rothschild was born in New York City and graduated from Wellesley College. She studied painting at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, with Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League, and with Karl Knaths and Hans Hofmann.         She worked in oils and did many collages. Her style ranged from Cubist imagery to symbolic use of astrology charts, timetables, stamps and railroad tickets.         Her 23-year marriage to Anton Myrer, a novelist, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a brother, Robert, of Manhattan, and a sister, Barbara Michaels of Ossining, N.Y.       
         Katherine Hynes de Groot, an English-born theater and television actress, died on Saturday at the Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. Ms. de Groot, who was 88, had been a resident of the Actors Fund Retirement Home in Englewood for the last six months.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Fiona Rhodes of Laguna Beach, Calif.         Ms. de Groot was born in a suburb of London and studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and appeared in British productions beside John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Tyrone Guthrie.         Her first performance in the United States was in "Lovers and Friends," with Katherine Cornell and Raymond Massey. Later, she appeared on Broadway in Bernard Shaw's "Apple Cart," with Maurice Evans; Sean O'Casey's "Red Roses for Me," with Kevin McCarthy, and "Point of No Return," with Henry Fonda.         She also appeared on television in several dramas by Paddy Chayefsky, including "The Mother" and "The Catered Affair."         After being selected by Moss Hart for the role of Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper, in "My Fair Lady," she toured with the National Company in the United States and the Soviet Union from 1956 to 1962.         In 1970, Ms. de Groot retired from acting to assist her husband, the food and wine expert Roy Andries de Groot, who died in 1983. The couple lived for many years in the Bleecker Gardens in Greenwich Village. Their first daughter, Christina, died of a heart ailment at the age of 26.       
         Patricia Peardon, the actress who created the central role in "Junior Miss" on Broadway, died yesterday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said her daughter Christine Noel Cameron of Manhattan.         Miss Peardon grew up in Allendale, N.J., and first began acting at the age of 8 on such radio programs as "Cavalcade of America" and "March of Time."  A Sassy Teen-Ager         In 1941, when she was 17, she made her Broadway debut at the Lyceum Theater in the hit comedy "Junior Miss," after having been discovered in an audition by the play's director, Moss Hart. Miss Peardon originated the role of Judy Graves, a sassy but frequently muddled adolescent.         Miss Peardon "is acting the central part of the younger sister like an inspired bear cub," said Brooks Atkinson in his review in The New York Times.         While starring in the play, Miss Peardon appeared on the cover of Life on Dec. 11, 1941, the week after Pearl Harbor was bombed; it was too late for the magazine's editors to change the cover.         In the early 1950's she acted in the television series "Johnny Jupiter," and in 1955, on Broadway, she played the spitfire younger daughter in the Tony Award-winning play "The Desperate Hours," acting with Paul Newman and Karl Malden.         In the 1950's and 60's, Miss Peardon toured with Arnold Moss's Shakespeare Festival Players in "The Tempest," "Measure for Measure," "Twelfth Night," "King Lear" and "Love's Labour's Lost," and performed in the 1960's at the American Festival Theater at Stratford, Conn.  As a Sculptor         In 1966, she began exhibiting and selling cast bronze sculptures, which were displayed three times in the windows at Tiffany & Company in Manhattan. Her work was also shown at many galleries, at Tufts University, and at the Metropolitan Opera House and Avery Fisher Hall.         Miss Peardon was married three times: to Peter Kalischer, a broadcast journalist; to Peter Brandt Harmon, a writer, and to Richard Horner, a producer. The marriages ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Cameron, she is survived by another daughter, Anne Cameron of Albuquerque, N.M., and a grandson, Alexander Cameron Little.       
         Rachel Higgins Everson, a civic leader and volunteer worker in Brooklyn for a half-century, died on Wednesday at the age of 91 at Southport Manor in Southport, Conn. A longtime resident of Brooklyn Heights, she had lived in Westport, Conn., in recent years.         The cause of death was a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Everson, known as Peggy, started as a volunteer at Colony South Brooklyn Houses, a settlement house, in 1924, the year of her marriage to Alfred Hall Everson. She served on many committees to enhance neighborhood life into the 1970's.         She was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Charles M. Higgins, the inventor of liquid India ink. She was a 1922 graduate of Vassar College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         Mrs. Everson was a past president, chairwoman, board member or officer of Brooklyn's first Planned Parenthood committee, the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, United Neighborhood Houses of New York, Colony House, the Brooklyn Central YWCA, Civitas, the Brooklyn Tuberculosis and Lung Association, the Brooklyn Women's Club, the Brooklyn chapter of the American Red Cross, and the Brooklyn division of the Protestant Council of the City of New York, among others.         In interviews, Mrs. Everson said she wanted to help those who were less fortunate than she had been, especially to give children a more promising future.         Mrs. Everson's husband, an engineer and executive in her father's Higgins Ink Company, died in 1969. She is survived by a daughter, Ann Everson of Westport; four sons, John, of Westport, Peter, of Norwalk, Conn., Robert, of Edmond, Okla., and Alfred Jr., of Palm City, Fla., and eight grandchildren.       
         Grace Lansing Lambert, a philanthropist and breeder of champion dogs and horses, died on Thursday at The Medical Center at Princeton, in Princeton, N.J. A resident of Princeton, she was 93.         The cause of death was pneumonia and advanced Parkinson's disease, according to the death certificate.         Mrs. Lambert was the widow of Gerard Barnes Lambert, her second husband, whose family's fortune was built on Listerine mouthwash and the manufacturing concern that became part of the Warner-Lambert Company. Mr. Lambert, an international yachtsman, died in 1967 at the age of 80.         Mrs. Lambert served on the boards of the Pierpont Morgan Library, Princeton University Library and Art Museum, and the University of Pennsylvania, among others. The Lamberts' former Princeton home, Albemarle, now houses the American Boychoir School, one of her beneficiaries.         Mrs. Lambert's Harrowby Kennels in Hopewell, N.J., bred show and field-trial dogs. She also raised Morgan horses, a breed of light horses.         A native of Canandaigua, N.Y., she married Mr. Lambert in 1936 after her first marriage, to John Mull, ended in divorce.         Mrs. Lambert is survived by two stepdaughters, Rachel Mellon of Upperville, Va., and Lily McCarthy of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; seven grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.       
         Frances Cullman Boas, a founder and trustee of the Gomez Foundation for Mill House, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mill House, in Marlboro, N.Y., is believed to be the oldest extant house built by a Jewish family in America.  The stone first story was constructed in 1714 by one of Mrs. Boas's ancestors, Louis Moses Gomez, as a home and trading post for his fur trade with the Indians. In 1772, it was bought by Wolfert Acker, who added a second story of brick.         Mrs. Boas was an enthusiastic angler, skilled at fly fishing for trout and salmon. She was the daughter of Joseph F. Cullman Jr. and Frances Wolff Cullman. Her father was a merchant of tobacco, cigars and cigarettes. Mrs. Boas's brother, Joseph Cullman 3d of Manhattan, is chairman emeritus of Philip Morris Companies.         Another brother, Edgar, also of Manhattan, is chairman of the Culbro Corporation of Manhattan, a diversified products company. Her brother Lewis, of Manhattan, is president of Cullman Ventures Inc., a private holding company.         Her husband, Percy E. Boas, a cotton broker, died in 1982.         Besides her three brothers, Mrs. Boas is survived by two daughters, Frances Jacobs Frawley and Barbara Jacobs Tamerin, both of Manhattan; a son, Robert Allen Jacobs Jr., of Westport, Conn.; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Duncan Sanford, a philanthropist and society grande dame for many years, died Sunday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98 and also had residences in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., Locust Valley, L.I., and Manhattan.         She died in her sleep.         Mrs. Sanford reigned over Palm Beach society for half a century. She was a founder of the Polo Ball and was active in many charities, including the American Cancer Society, the American Red Cross and Planned Parenthood.         In New York City, Mrs. Sanford was the longtime national chairwoman of the April in Paris Ball Committee, which raised money for several charities, including the Leukemia Society of America and the Parkinson's Disease Foundation.         She arrived in Palm Beach in 1933, newly wed to Stephen Sanford, an international polo star and a director of the Bigelow-Sanford Carpet Company Inc.  He died in 1977.         In Palm Beach, they lived in a mansion, Los Incas, near the winter home of Rose Kennedy, who became Mrs. Sanford's close friend. The Sanfords regularly entertained a wide variety of notables, including the King and Queen of Jordan and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.         Mrs. Sanford was a native of Richmond. She attended Cornell University for a year but dropped out to become an actress. She had an early success in the lead role in "Shanghai Gesture" at the Martin Beck Theater on Broadway.         She later went to Hollywood, where she co-starred with Marion Davies in "Five and Ten." Miss Davies introduced her to Mr. Sanfordafter a polo match in Santa Barbara, Calif.         Mrs. Sanford is survived by a niece, A. Maxine Warner of Alexandria, Va., and a grandniece.       
         Elizabeth Montgomery, a costume and set designer and a founding partner of the design company Motley, died on Saturday at her home in London. She was 91.         Miss Montgomery was born in Kid lington, Oxfordshire, and grew up in Cambridge, England. She attended Westminster Art School in London, studying portrait painting with Walter Sickert. In 1932, she and two other art students, Margaret Harris and Sophia Harris, founded a theatrical design group, which they named Motley, an allusion to the line "Motley's the only wear" from "As You Like It."         Motley created its first costumes for "Romeo and Juliet," directed by John Gielgud at Oxford University, and the company soon made its mark with costumes for his production of "Richard of Bordeaux." The Gielgud collaboration continued for the next decade. The company created sets and costumes for more than 30 Old Vic productions. An American Branch         In 1940, Miss Montgomery and Margaret Harris traveled to the United States as the costume designers for "Romeo and Juliet," starring Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh. After marrying the writer Robert P. Wilmot, Miss Montgomery took up residence in the United States.         As the American branch of Motley, she and Miss Harris created costumes for Katharine Cornell in "The Doctor's Dilemma" and "The Three Sisters" in the early 1940's. Miss Harris returned to Britain in 1946. Miss Montgomery's later Broadway credits include "Anne of the Thousand Days," "Peter Pan" "South Pacific," "The Most Happy Fella," "Paint Your Wagon" and "Can-Can."         In 1958, her costumes for "The First Gentleman" won a Tony Award. That year she designed sets and costumes for "Il Trovatore" at the Metropolitan Opera.         Motley created the costumes for the David Lean film "Great Expectations," and Miss Montgomery designed the costumes for "Oklahoma!," "Little Women" and "Long Day's Journey Into Night."         The partners in Motley wrote two books, "Designing and Making Stage Costumes" (1964, reissued by Routledge in 1992) and "Theater Props" (1975).         She is survived by a son, John Wilmot of Fremantle, Australia, and four stepdaughters: Patricia Christgau of Woodbury, Conn., Dorothy Zinbardi of Brentwood, L.I., Roberta Wilmot of Idaho and Joan Clarke of Spokane, Wash.       
         Julia Knickerbocker, a leader in the field of book publicity, died on Sunday at the Robert Janker Clinic in Bonn. She was 56 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure after fighting cancer for two years, said her sister, Miranda de Kay.         A longtime public relations executive in book publishing, Ms. Knickerbocker influenced a whole generation of young public relations executives who now hold significant positions in various houses. She was known for her elegance, wit and style.         At her death, she was vice president and director of media relations at Bantam Books in New York. There she worked with authors such as Robert Pirsig, whose "Lila" (1991) became a major best seller.         "She was that rare publicist equally adept at getting attention for literary, serious kiss-and-tell and pop entertainment novels," said Stuart Applebaum, vice president of publicity and public relations at Bantam Doubleday Dell.         Much of her career was with Simon & Schuster, where she began in 1974 as a senior publicist and rose to be associate publisher. For more than a decade as director of publicity, she was the driving force behind all of Simon & Schuster's campaigns, working with such best-selling authors as Jackie Collins and Jane Fonda.         She began her career at M. Evans & Company in 1967 and later headed the publicity department at William Morrow & Company.         She was born in Paris, where her father, H. R. Knickerbocker, was a correspondent for United Press. She graduated from Radcliffe in 1958.         Her marriage to Charles La Muniere ended in divorce.         Besides her sister Mrs. de Kay, she is survived by another sister, Suzanne Colt, and two daughters, Noelle La Muniere McElroy Carter and Suzanne La Muniere, all of Manhattan.       
         Joan Sperry Rader, who was active for two decades in the Republican Party in Connecticut, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 58.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, William Donald Rader.         Mrs. Rader, who had lived in Greenwich since 1965, was a real-estate broker and longtime school trustee. She was elected in 1989 to a two-year term as the vice chairwoman of the Republican State Central Committee of Connecticut, becoming its highest-ranking female officer. She was re-elected to a second, successive term and held the office at the time of her death.         Her many volunteer activities over the years included serving as a trustee of the Eagle Hill School in Greenwich, a private day and boarding school for learning-disabled children and teen-agers. A Brooklyn Native         Since 1981 she had been a real-estate broker with Douglas, Elliman Pickering Associates in Greenwich.         Mrs. Rader was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Edward G. Sperry, who was for some years president of the Sperry Products Company, which manufactured railroad and subway track-testing equipment and other products in Connecticut and on Long Island, and the former Mary Elizabeth Garvin, who was a company director.         She grew up in Oyster Bay, L.I., and graduated in 1956 from Vassar College, where she majored in economics. In 1958 she married Mr. Rader.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Rader is survived by three daughters, Judith Anne, of Boston, Jennifer Caroline, of Springfield, Ohio, and Elizabeth Rader Edwards of Riverside, Conn.; two sisters, Judith Sperry Beavers of Old Greenwich, Conn., and Joy Sperry Emery of Ballston Lake, N.Y., and a granddaughter.       
         Beatrice Bishop Berle, a physician, teacher and author, died on Friday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass.  She was 90 years old.         Her death was caused by complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Beatrice Berle Meyerson.         Dr. Berle, who ran a neighbhorhood health clinic in East Harlem from 1953 until 1962, took a pioneering approach to family medicine by treating the entire family for the effects of heroin abuse by a member. She also helped to establish methadone maintenance as a significant treatment for heroin abuse.         Dr. Berle, who was born on Aug. 6, 1902, in Lenox, Mass, graduated from Vassar College in 1923. She received a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1924 and a medical degree from New York University in 1938.         In 1927 she married Adolf A. Berle Jr., an economist and lawyer who served during the Roosevelt Administration as Assistant Secretary of State. Dr. Berle worked in the United States Public Health Service in Washington from 1943 until 1944. Worked in Brazil         Traveling to Brazil with her husband, who was Ambassador to Brazil from 1945 until 1946, Dr. Berle volunteered in hospital wards in Rio de Janeiro, where she organized efforts to expand the practice of preventive medicine. She also wrote articles and edited a book on medical problems in Brazil.         Her other books were "Eighty Puerto Rican Families in New York City," a study of the families in her East Harlem clinic, published by Columbia University Press in 1958, and "A Life in Two Worlds," an autobiography published in in 1983 by Walker & Company.         During her career, Dr. Berle was associated with St. Luke's Hospital Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at the Bronx State Hospital, Cornell University Medical College, New York University Medical College and Yeshiva University.         After the death of her first husband in 1971, Dr. Berle in 1975 married Dr. Andre F. Cournand, a physican who was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1956. Dr. Cournand died in 1988.         In addition to Ms. Meyerson, of Washington, Dr. Berle is survived by another daughter, Alice Berle Crawford of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, Peter A. A. Berle of Manhattan; 10 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Anne M. Johnson, a former vice president of Beginner Books, a children's book division of Random House, died on Sunday at her home in Clifton, N.J. She was 62.         She had a brief illness, said Robert L. Bernstein, with whom she had worked at Random House.         Mrs. Johnson, a native of Staten Island, graduated from Hunter College and briefly worked for Doubleday & Company before joining Random House in 1956 as a secretary. The following year she began to work with Mr. Bernstein. From 1966 she was the assistant to the chairman and president while Mr. Bernstein held those positions at Random House.         At Beginner Books, she worked closely with Theodor S. Geisel, the star author for that imprint known as Dr. Seuss. She was a board member of the Dr. Seuss Foundation.         Mrs. Johnson was the widow of Hugh Johnson, executive vice president of Hammond Publishing, who died in 1987.       
         Vera, the artist and designer whose name has been emblazoned on brightly printed scarves, bed and table linens, draperies and sportswear for nearly 50 years, died on Tuesday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 84 and lived in Ossining, N.Y.         The cause was cardiac arrest after surgery, said Tom Costello, a friend and business associate.         Vera Neumann, who used only her first name professionally, was a painter whose work was exhibited in many countries, and her designs typically began as paintings. For motifs, she preferred flowers, leaves, ferns, grass, vegetables, the sun and ladybugs. A "ladybug means good luck in every language," she said.         She introduced the first signature scarf in the late 1940's. Another trend she started was to offer collections saluting the countries she visited in her frequent travels, including Brazil, Denmark, Finland, India and Portugal. A Taste for Purity         Vera's style could be realistic or abstract. Her penchant for purity could mean a scarf or place mat printed in one color at a time when other designers might have used a dozen.         "If you have too many colors," she explained, "you could easily get tied down to just one color scheme that can't be changed." A shy, private person, she did not like to make speeches. "Color is the language I speak best," she said.         Vera was born in Stamford, Conn., and took night classes at Cooper Union, which honored her with its Outstanding Alumna Award. She was a designer of children's furniture and murals when she met and married George Neumann. They and a third partner, F. Werner Hamm, each risked $1,000 in 1946 to start a business. Its first order, from B. Altman, was for three place mats, made of parachute silk and hand-delivered by Mr. Hamm.         The enterprise prospered. By 1977, Vera designs were sold in more than 1,200 stores, with sales of more than $100 million. The company had been bought 10 years earlier for $5 million by Manhattan Industries and has been a division of Salant Corporation since 1988. Vera Companies -- Scarves by Vera and Linens by Vera -- has showrooms on Fifth Avenue, and Vera herself continued to supply designs until several months ago.         Vera's husband died in 1960. She is survived by her daughter, Evelyn Fyler of Ossining; her son, John Neumann of Carmel, N.Y, and four grandchildren.       
         Marjorie Henderson Buell, the creator of Little Lulu, the mischievous cartoon character with corkscrew curls who regularly outwitted the neighborhood boys, died on Sunday in the Elyria (Ohio) United Methodist Home. She was 88.         The cause was lymphoma, said John D. Harvith, the co-arranger in 1982 of the only comprehensive retrospective of Mrs. Buell's work, in Oberlin, Ohio.         "She was a pioneer in presenting a girl cartoon character who was resourceful, courageous and who regularly beat out the boys," said Mr. Harvith. Mrs. Buell, who was known as Marge, was also a role model for future cartoon entrepreneurs, since she kept control of the rights to the Little Lulu character. She licensed a host of spinoffs, including comic books, 26 animated cartoon features, greeting cards, dolls, games, puzzles, toys and coloring books.         The Lulu marketing empire was international, with comic books published in languages that included Arabic, Finnish, Japanese, Spanish and Greek. Mrs. Buell sold her copyrights to Western Publishing Company when she retired in 1971.         Mrs. Buell was born in Philadelphia on Dec. 11, 1904. Her first cartoon was published in 1921, when she was 16, in The Philadelphia Ledger. Soon her work found a market in the Ledger syndicate, and ultimately in Life, when it was a comic magazine, as well as The Saturday Evening Post, The Country Gentleman, Judge and Collier's.         In 1934 The Saturday Evening Post asked her to draw a weekly cartoon for the magazine's back page. George Horace Lorimer, the editor, wanted a young female character to take the place of another cartoon that was moving from The Post to King Features Syndicate.         The first "Little Lulu" drawing appeared in December 1935. So popular had the character become by 1944 that Mrs. Buell took Lulu and her friends Tubby, Alvin, Annie and Wilbur from The Post and made the cartoon a daily syndicated comic strip. Lulu also served as the advertising mascot for Kleenex tissues until 1960.         Mrs. Buell is survived by her husband, Clarence Addison Buell; two sons, Lawrence I., of Boston, and Frederick H., of Warwick, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Ethel Hausman, a founder and major supporter of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College in Manhasset, L. I., died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         She and her husband, Jack, joined Leonard and Isabel Goldenson and Jane Hoving in 1946 to found United Cerebral Palsy of New York City. All were parents of children with the disease, including the Hausmans' son Peter, who died last year. Their efforts also led to the formation of the national United Cerebral Palsy Associations, which merged similar groups around the country. Efforts Raised Millions         Mrs. Hausman founded the Women's Division of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and oversaw fund-raising campaigns that raised millions of dollars for the agency, which serves adults and children with cerebral palsy and related disabilities. She also was vice president of the International Cerebral Palsy Society in London and a board member of Rehabilitation International.         Mrs. Hausman devoted much of her life to helping others, especially chidren. With her husband, she was a principal donor to North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, where the Ethel and Jack Hausman Department of Pediatrics attests to their support.         North Shore University Hospital opened in Manhasset in 1953. But Mrs. Hausman was already engaged in fund raising in the late 1940's, when local residents pressed for the construction of a hospital in the area. She later served as co-chairwoman of the interior design committee.         Ethel and Jack Hausman endowed chairs bearing their names for a professor of pediatrics at North Shore University Hospital and for cerebral-palsy research at Harvard University.         Born in Manhattan, Ethel Hausman went to work in a restaurant at age 16. In 1927, she married Jack Hausman, whose family fortune derived from the textile business. He is vice chairman and former chairman of Belding Heminway Company, the Manhattan textile concern.         Mrs. Hausman served as a volunteer ambulance driver in World War II. She was an original tour guide at United Nations headquarters and a member of the U.N.'s Department of Public Information from 1949-64.         Besides her husband of nearly 65 years, Mrs. Hausman is survived by two sons, Richard and Michael, both of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Hannah Troy, an influential women's fashion designer and manufacturer who invented the petite size and introduced modern Italian styles to the United States, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Miami Beach, where she lived. She was 93.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Her two major contributions to fashion resulted from chance and keen observation.         "I was at a May Company store in California when I noticed women pulling at their shoulders and waistlines and saw that most dresses didn't fit properly," she recalled from the late 1940's. Alterations were troublesome and sometimes spoiled the design.         On a hunch that the long-waisted ideal female form was more myth than reality, she studied measurements the military had made of women who volunteered in World War II. The statistics confirmed that the typical woman was short-waisted.         So Mrs. Troy introduced the petite size, saying, "The word had a nice ring." The concept proved a popular success. The Italian Look         Her next innovation came in 1951. After the annual Paris fashion shows, she took a side trip to Florence. Impressed with its fashions, she bought samples and returned home promoting the Italian look.         The following season, 300 American fashion representatives showed up in Italy and a new era began.         In the mid-1960's she advocated the tent dress so "the woman who is a little plump can look stylish."         Mrs. Troy described her fashions as "elegant, somewhat classic, timeless, the kind a woman can add to from year to year." She produced blouses, dresses, gowns and suits, favoring silk, wool, tweed, linen, taffeta and satin.         Her career was at its peak from the late 1940's until her retirement in 1968. She supplied top Manhattan stores like Saks, Bergdorf Goodman, Bonwit Teller, Henri Bendel, Lord & Taylor, B. Altman and Bloomingdale's. Pat Nixon and Mamie Van Doren were among her customers.         Mrs. Troy, a Brooklyn native, grew up in the garment industry.         "I started sewing as soon as I could thread a needle," she said. By 12 she was making dresses for her sisters. As a teen-ager, she was a model. After graduating as the valedictorian at Erasmus Hall High School, she worked at a blouse company, then opened her business.         She supported charities and made a personal cause of the Mazzini School in Florence after learning that some poor students took turns going to class because their families had only one coat and one pair of shoes to share among the siblings.         Mrs. Troy had three marriages, to Aaron Hartman, Theodore Troy and Max Meyer, all deceased.         She is survived by a son from her first marriage, William J. Troy, and a sister, Shirley Stern, both of Miami, and two grandchildren.       
         May Davies Hopkins Martenet, a novelist and short-story writer, died on Sunday at the Westminster-Canterbury retirement home in Virginia Beach, Va., where she had lived since 1985. She was 85 and had been a longtime resident of Manhattan.         The cause was complications stemming from lung cancer, said her son-in-law, William Van Orden Gnichtel.         While living in New York, Mrs. Martenet wrote short fiction pieces, which were published in a variety of magazines, and a well-received novel, "Taw Jameson" (1953), which told of a ruthless game of social climbing in a Southern industrial town. A short story, "Father Delacroix," was included in a collection, "The Best American Short Stories."         She was born in Newport News, Va., where her father was the president of the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company.         Her husband of nearly 40 years, Edwin Martenet, died in 1972.         She is survived by two grandsons.       
         Arleen Auger, an American soprano who was renowned for both her commanding presence on the opera stage and the subtlety of her song interpretations, died on Thursday at the home of a friend in Leusden, a suberb of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. She was 53 and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Mary Lou Falcone, Miss Auger's publicity agent, said the cause was brain cancer.         Miss Auger's most famous performance was her appearance at the wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, on July 23, 1986. She sang Mozart's "Exsultate, Jubilate" as part of the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, which was televised globally and seen by some 500 million people.  Debut in Vienna         Mozart was always at the core of her repertory. Miss Auger (pronounced awe-ZHAY) had exactly the right flexibility, coloring and vocal weight for Mozart opera roles and concert works, and they were the vehicles with which she had her biggest successes. She made her operatic debut as the Queen of the Night in a 1967 Vienna State Opera production of "Die Zauberflote." Nine years later she made her New York debut in the same role at the New York City Opera. Among her recent recordings are highly praised portrayals of Donna Anna in "Don Giovanni" and the Countess in "Le Nozze di Figaro."         She also won great acclaim for her performances of Bach, Handel and Haydn, and although she did not eschew the use of vibrato, as other early-music singers did, she was considered a supremely stylish interpreter of that repertory. Still, she resolutely resisted being typecast. She constantly expanded her repertory, and applied her rich tone and her thoughtful sense of line to everything from Schubert and Schumann lieder and turn-of-the-century French art songs to works by Weill, Berg and Schoenberg. Libby Larsen and Judith Zaimont were among the composers from whom she commissioned new song cycles.         "I sing Bach, Mozart, contemporary music and everything in between," she wrote in an article for Keynote in 1985. "If it's for my voice and my voice can do it well, I'm happy to do it."         But Miss Auger was a late bloomer, musically: she did not begin studying voice until she was out of college and working as an elementary-school teacher in Chicago. And when she auditioned for the Vienna State Opera, she knew only one role, the Queen of the Night.  Taught Elementary Schoolers         Arleen Auger was born in South Gate, Calif., on Sept. 13, 1939. She studied the piano and violin briefly as a child and sang in community choirs, but she later told interviewers that she had had very little exposure to classical music when she was growing up. She attended California State University at Long Beach, where she earned a degree in education in 1963. For the next four years, she taught elementary school in Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.         The world of opera and art song opened for her in 1965, when she was teaching in Chicago and began studying voice with Ralph Errolle. She apparently progressed quickly; two years later, when she was teaching first grade in Los Angeles, she won first prize in the I. Victor Fuchs Competition. The prize included a trip to Vienna to audition for the Volksoper. Her audition repertory included three pieces: the two Queen of the Night arias and Olympia's aria from Offenbach's "Tales of Hoffmann."         As it turned out, the soprano Lucia Popp had just withdrawn from a production of "Zauberflote" at the Vienna State Opera. That company's director, Josef Krips, heard Miss Auger's audition at the smaller Volksoper, and offered her a contract. When she joined the company, she later said, she knew only the one role, had no stage experience and did not speak German. She made her debut without a rehearsal, and had to ask other singers where to go as she was pushed out on stage.  Sought Expanded Repertory         But she prospered in Vienna. During her first two years she added a dozen roles to her repertory, and she remained with the company until 1974, when she began to find the State Opera's repertory expectations too constricting. When she left the company she began singing more frequently at other European houses, including La Scala. She also expanded her recital repertory and took a teaching position at the Academy of Music and Drama in Frankfurt, where she taught until 1987.         She had by then become intent on regulating the pace of her career. She refused to sing roles if she did not consider herself ready for them, sometimes alienating conductors whose invitations she declined. But she said later that those decisions saved her voice and prolonged her career.         By the early 1980's, Miss Auger's European career was thriving, though her concert and opera appearances in the United States had been relatively few. She had cemented her reputation as an early-music singer at the Oregon Bach Festival, directed by Helmuth Rilling (with whom she recorded more than 50 Bach cantatas) and at the New England Bach Festival. But at the time, American listeners knew her mostly through what was already a vast discography.         Miss Auger began to cultivate an American following seriously in January 1984, when she sang Mozart, Schubert, Debussy and Strauss songs at her New York debut recital at Alice Tully Hall. Reviewing that concert in The New York Times, Donal Henahan praised the clarity of her tone and her sensitivity to musical and textual nuances. "Although pure lyricism is obviously Miss Auger's strong point, there is more to her than that," he wrote, adding that she "is a singing actress of some depth." Explored the Nuances         Thereafter, Miss Auger performed more frequently in the United States, and her recitals were high points of the concert season for fans of art song. Statuesque and attractive, she was a compelling and elegant stage personality who invariably gave the impression of having thoroughly explored both the overt emotional resonance and the underlying psychological nuances of the songs on her programs. She continued performing until last season, when her illness forced her to cancel touring plans and recording projects.         Miss Auger made nearly 200 recordings, documenting a vast repertory that ranged from her Bach, Mozart and Handel specialties to a series of both standard and offbeat opera and song projects. Many of her recordings won international awards, including the Grand Prix du Disque, the Edison Prize and the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis.         She is survived by her parents, Everett and Doris Auger, and a brother, Ralph Auger of Healdsburg, Calif. SELECTED RECORDINGS         Arleen Auger's recordings document her talents as opera singer, recitalist and soloist in oratorios and symphonic choral works. These are some of her recordings, all on compact disk.         Brahms: A German Requiem (Telarc)         Canteloube: Songs of the Auvergne (Virgin)         Handel: "Orlando" (L'Oiseau-Lyre); "Messiah" (Archiv)         Handel and Bach Arias (Delos)         Mendelssohn: A Midsummer Night's Dream (Philips)         Monteverdi: "L'Incoronazione di Poppea" (Virgin)         Mozart: "Le Nozze di Figaro" (L'Oiseau-Lyre); "Lucio Silla" (Philips)         Mozart/Strauss/Wolf: Lieder (Sony Classical)         Strauss: Four Last Songs (Telarc)         Wolf: Lieder (Hyperion)         "Love Songs": works by Copland, Britten, Strauss, Schumann, Gounod, Mahler, Foster, others (Delos)       
         Genevieve Millet Landau, former editor in chief of Parents magazine and an expert in child development, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, the family said.         Mrs. Landau joined the staff of Parents in 1957, becoming editor in chief in 1970. She resigned from the magazine in 1978 to create the Hasbro Center for Child Development and Education, a nonprofit arm of the Hasbro Toy Company.         She served as editorial director of the Dell Magazine Group from 1981 until she retired in 1987. She later worked as a volunteer for the Fortune Society, a nonprofit organization that helps former convicts.         She graduated in 1954 from Hobart and William Smith Colleges. Besides numerous articles, she was the author of a book, "The Gift of Play," (Walker & Company, 1980), with Maria W. Piers.         Survivors include her husband, Sidney; two daughters, Elizabeth Millet of Manhattan and Jessica Rosenberg of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.       
         Alice Magdol Conrad, who ran her own executive recruiting firm, Magdol & McCone, died on Wednesday at her country home in Bridgehampton, L.I. She was 52.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         Mrs. Magdol, who also lived in Manhattan, started her career as a copywriter at Seventeen magazine, moving to Adams Dana and Silverstein, an advertising agency in 1966. She subsequently joined Judy Wald Associates, a recruiting firm for the advertising industry, and then went to London where she founded that company's London office.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Conrad returned to New York where she joined Foote, Cone & Belding, the advertising agency.         In 1979 she founded Magdol & McCone with Bonnie McCone. Mrs. McCone retired shortly after the firm was founded. It specialized in recruitment for advertising companies, including Grey, BBD& O, and Wells Rich & Greene, and for such financial institutions as Citibank.         Mrs. Conrad was born in Manhattan. She attended Riverdale Country Day School, graduating in 1957. She graduated magna cum laude from Pembroke College in 1961.         She was active in the Financial Women's Association and Women's Campaign Fund.         She is survived by her huband, Richard; her son, David; her stepdaughter, Jordyn, and her mother, Bea, all of Manhattan, and two sisters, Caroline Anderson of Brooklyn Heights and Martha Hayes of San Francisco.       
         Dr. Gladys Lounsbury Hobby, a microbiologist who helped to move penicillin from a laboratory discovery to mass production during World War II, died on Sunday at her home at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 82.         The cause was a heart attack, Pfizer Inc. said. She had worked at Pfizer's Brooklyn plant.         In her book, "Penicillin: Meeting the Challenge" (Yale University Press, 1985), Dr. Hobby chronicled penicillin's precarious journey from laboratory to factory, beginning with Sir Alexander Fleming's intriguing find of 1928. Discussing the program to make the drug available in large quantities in the face of wartime needs in the early 1940's, she likened its urgency and scope to the Manhattan Project, which produced the atom bomb.         She had first helped to refine penicillin specifically for the treatment of infections as a member of a research team at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. Then, in 15 years at Pfizer, she also worked to develop streptomycin and other antibiotics.         A specialist in antimicrobial therapy, she was among those who did the early work on the broad-spectrum Terramycin and contributed to the understanding of how such drugs work.         A native of Manhattan, Dr. Hobby graduated from Vassar College in 1931 and earned her master's degree and a Ph.D. in bacteriology at Columbia. She was associated with Presbyterian Hospital and the Columbia Medical School from 1934 to 1943, after which she joined Chas Pfizer & Company to continue her research.         She left Pfizer in 1959 to become chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital in East Orange, N.J., where she specialized in chronic infectious diseases. Until her retirement in 1977 she also served as an assistant clinical research professor in public health at Cornell University Medical College.         She then worked as a consultant and freelance science writer. She was the author of some 200 publications and for eight years edited Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a monthly she founded in 1972.         Dr. Hobby is survived by a sister, Winifred Evans, also of Kennett Square.       
         Gusti Huber, a leading Viennese actress before World War II who continued her successful stage and film career in this country, died on Monday at her home in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 78.         The family said the cause was heart failure.         Ms. Huber made her American debut in 1952 in "Flight Into Egypt," the story of an Austrian refugee family struggling to get to America, directed by Elia Kazan. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson wrote that Ms. Huber "brings a grave, sensitive beauty to the character and describes with rare perception the excitement and the pain of a woman whose responsibilities are beyond human strength." Portrayed Anne Frank's Mother         She is best known in this country for her portrayal of Edith Frank in the Broadway production of "The Diary of Anne Frank," which won the Pulitzer Prize and Critics Circle Award in 1956. "Gusti Huber gives a superbly controlled performance as the patient mother who is close to hysteria," wrote Mr. Atkinson.         Ms. Huber also won praise for her performance in George Stevens's 1959 film version of the Anne Frank story.  After retiring from acting in 1961, she lectured in New York area high schools on the legacy of Anne Frank, the Jewish girl who hid from the Nazis in a garret in Amsterdam and who died in a concentration camp shortly before the end of World War II..         While still a student at the Academy for Music and Representative Art in Vienna, Ms. Huber began her acting career in 1929 at the Deutsches Volkstheatre. Joining the Schauspielhaus in Zurich, she played more than 180 roles in a five-year period.         After the liberation of Austria in World War II, she joined a company entertaining American troops. She met and married Joseph Besch, a United States Army captain and former newspaperman.         She is survived by her husband of 47 years; three daughters, Christiana MacDonald of Paris, and Bibi Besch and Drea B. Gillogly, both of Los Angeles; a son, Andrew F. Besch of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.       
         Ariel D. Rubstein, a soprano who performed throughout the United States and Europe, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 41.         The cause was AIDS, her family said.         Ms. Rubstein made her Carnegie Hall debut in 1988 as Barena in an acclaimed concert version of Janacek's "Jenufa" by the Opera Orchestra of New York. The performance, which starred Gabriela Benackova and Leonie Rysanek, was recorded live and released on compact disk.         Ms. Rubstein was born in Portland, Ore., to parents in the performing arts. Her father, also named Ariel, was a Russian-born pianist, the director of the Portland School of Music and a founder of the Portland Opera. Her mother, the former Eleanor Reed, was a stage actress.         As a student, Ms. Rubstein was encouraged by Rudolf Serkin to pursue music. She studied at the Juilliard School and won a scholarship for studies in Vienna.         Ms. Rubstein performed with the Opera Company of Boston, the Houston Grand Opera, the Portland Opera and other ensembles throughout the United States. She also sang with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, the New Orleans Philharmonic and other orchestras in the United States.         She is survived by her father, of Portland; a brother, Peter, of Manhattan, and a sister, Victoria Pierson of Portland.       
         Elizabeth Hannah Waters, a modern dancer and choreographer who performed with Hanya Holm's company in the 1930's and who founded the dance program at the University of New Mexico, died on June 5 at her home in Echo Canyon, N.M. She was 83.         Ms. Waters was born in Salem, Ore. She studied in Colorado at the Perry-Mansfield School and in New York City with Ruth St. Denis, also working as the famed dancer's personal maid and assistant in 1931. When Ms. Holm, a disciple of the German modern-dance pioneer Mary Wigman, opened the American Wigman School in New York, Ms. Waters became a scholarship student. She was a soloist in the Holm company from 1935 to 1939 and was Ms. Holm's teaching assistant at the Bennington School of the Dance in Vermont.         In 1940, she formed her own company, Dancers en Route, with Alwin Nikolais. During World War II, she worked as a welder at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico and taught dance in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Las Vegas, Nev.         Ms. Waters taught at the University of New Mexico from 1946 to 1973; among her students was Tim Wengerd, a principal in the Martha Graham Dance Company in the 1970's and 1980's. Ms. Waters choreographed more than 50 works.         She is survived by a brother and several nieces.       
         Olive A. Beech, a leader in the aviation industry and a co-founder and chairwoman of the Beech Aircraft Company, died yesterday at her home in Wichita, Kan., at the age of 89, her family said.         Under her leadership, Beech Aircraft became a leading manufacturer of private airplanes for general aviation, including propeller, turbo-prop and jet planes. It also won missile and space contracts.         Mrs. Beech's career began by chance. As a young woman, she was hired in 1925 as the secretary to Walter Beech, the director of the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in Wichita. They later married.         In 1932 they formed their company as the Beechcraft company, with Mrs. Beech as the secretary-treasurer. While her husband was a talented designer of planes, she emerged as the hard-driving supervisor and shrewd manager of the corporate finances.         When Mr. Beech suffered encephalitis in 1940, she took full command and retained much of that control even after he returned to work.         Upon his death in 1950, she took over as president and chairwoman. She gave up the presidency in 1968 and remained as chairwoman until 1982, then became chairwoman emeritus.         The company grew from having a handful of employees to a payroll of more than 10,000 and annual sales exceeding $900 million.         The Raytheon Company bought Beech Aircraft in 1980, and she was elected to the parent company's board and executive committee.         Mrs. Beech was a past president of the Women's International Association of Aeronautics and a leader in other aviation organizations. She was appointed to national boards by Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon.         Fortune magazine twice named her as one of the top 10 women in business in the 1970's. She was awarded the aviation industry's Wright Brothers Trophy and was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame. She was also active in many charitable organizations.         Mrs. Beech was born on a farm in Waverly, Kan., and grew up in Paola, Kan. She displayed her budding managerial talent at the age of 11 when she took over some of the family's financial chores, including paying its bills. She was educated at the American Secretarial and Business College in Wichita.         Surviving are two daughters, Suzanne Beech Warner of Boulder City, Nev., and Mary Lynn Oliver of Wichita, and three grandchildren.       
         Arlene Streit Yagoda, an owner and breeder of thoroughbred race horses, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center. She was 51 and lived in Woodmere, L.I.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Carrying on a family tradition, she raced horses throughout the country with her husband, and their son Aaron became a handicapper, starting at the age of 8. The columnist Red Smith wrote about a typical day at Aqueduct when Aaron, then 10, picked six winners, the daily double and an exacta.         Mrs. Yagoda, who was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Hofstra University. Her grandfather, Aaron, founded the Streit Matzoh Company.         She was married for 30 years to Stanley Yagoda, who was president of the Hot Dogger clothing company.         Besides her husband, her survivors include her parents, Ruth and Jack Streit of Brooklyn; two sons, Phillip, of Manhattan, and Aaron, of Manhattan and Hallendale, Fla., and two sisters, Myrna Heilbrun of Manhattan and Nettie Streit of Brooklyn.         Correction:  August 21, 1993, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about an owner and breeder of thoroughbred horses rendered her first name incorrectly, as did the headline. She was Arlyne (not Arlene) Streit Yagoda.       
         Alison Raymond Lanier, who made a career of untangling the confusions that foreign posts might pose for American career women, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 76.         She was the author of a series of books explaining the ways of overseas cultures. But since such exchanges are a two-way street, she also wrote books to help foreigners sort out the mysterious ways of American society.         Thus, her "Living in the U.S.A." (Scribner, 1973) was translated into half a dozen languages, including Arabic, Japanese and Chinese. Her last book, "The Rising Sun on Main Street: Working with the Japanese" (International Information Press, 1990), sought to help Americans puzzled by the customs of Japanese living among them.         Her 11 books included an "Update" series that went through several editions, most of them issued by her own company, Overseas Briefing Associates, and by Intercultural Press. They ranged from "Update -- Britain" to "Update -- Venezuela". Graduate of Bryn Mawr         Mrs. Lanier, a native of Manhattan, was a 1938 honors graduate of Bryn Mawr College, for which she did public-relations work in the early 1940's. In World War II, she served in the United States Navy Women's Reserve, retiring in 1946 as a commander.         In the 1950's she traveled widely as executive director of the foundation-supported Committee of Correspondence, which worked to make women into leaders in their countries' development. These experiences prompted her first book, "Half the World's People" (Apoleton-Century-Crofts, 1965). After that she directed hospitality programs at the United Nations for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.         In 1967 she founded Overseas Briefing Associates. It provided seminars for corporations and organizations increasingly active overseas and ready to dispatch personnel into unfamiliar territory. The briefings went over the difficulties facing women, whose chances of foreign assignments were just opening up.         Two years ago she organized a volunteer service to help newcomers from the former Soviet bloc to tackle English and adjust to life in America.         Mrs. Lanier's husband, Albert G., died last September.         She is survived by a sister, Audrey McMahon of Lawrenceville, N.J., and a brother, Edward A. Raymond of North Branford, Conn.       
         Charlotte Singer Morrell, co-founder of Morrell & Company, wine and liquor merchants in New York City, died on Thursday at Beth Israel North Hospital in Manhattan. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She and her husband, Samuel, founded the business in 1948. They were then joined by their children, Roberta and Peter. When their parents retired, the children took over the business on Madison Avenue.         In addition to her daughter and son, Mrs. Morrell is survived by four grandchildren.       
         Reva Clamage Shwayder, an artist who was the subject of a documentary film that won an Academy Award, died at her home in Franklin, Mich., on Thursday. She was 91.         The cause was complications of a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Shwayder was married for 62 years to Benjamin Shwayder, who with his four brothers founded the Samsonite Corporation.         She took an interest in the business and sat in on family discussions guiding the growth of the company, said her grandson, Mark Shwayder.         Samsonite developed and became the world's largest manufacturer of hard-sided luggage, then expanded into the production of folding chairs and tables. Mr. Shwayder, who invented devices for the company, was its president.         Starting in 1950, Mrs. Shwayder became a painter, doing large worksin acrylics and water colors that featured bright flowers and landscapes in an abstract style.         When she retired two years ago, she had produced hundreds of paintings and had held many exhibits. She sold her works to private collectors and corporate clients including Ford, Chrysler, I.B.M. and Kresge, as well as to the Detroit Institute of Arts and Pennsylvania Academy of Arts.         Her husband died in 1981, and five years later she married Louis Gothelf, a painter, but she retained her original married name.         Mr. Gothelf's daughter, Sue Marx, joined Pamela Conn in directing "Young at Heart," which was shown at the New York Film Festival and won the Academy Award in the short subject category in 1988.         The movie focused on Mrs. Shwayder's career and remarriage late in life, and how she coped with the losses of her first husband and sons Warren, who died in a scuba diving accident, and Richard, who died of cancer soon after.         Mrs. Shwayder was born in Chicago and studied at the University of Chicago.         Her survivors include her husband; a sister, Anne Klein of Laguna Beach, Calif.; six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.

         Letitia Ide, who performed with the Humphrey-Weidman and Jose Limon modern-dance companies in the 1930's and 40's, died on Sunday at her home in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 84.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Timothy Ratner of Manhattan.         Miss Ide was born and grew up in Springfield, Ill.She moved to New York to train as a dancer, studying at the Isadora Duncan school and performing with Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman from 1930 to 1937. From 1946 to 1948 she was a principal dancer with the Jose Limon Dance Company, creating roles in "Lament for Ignacio Sanchez Mejias" and "Day on Earth," both by Humphrey. "Letitia Ide looks like a young goddess and moves like one as well," John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1949.         Miss Ide was Mr. Limon's partner in several dances and later helped to recreate the dances for other companies. She is featured in a 1959 film of "Lament" and returned to the company to perform her role, the Figure of Destiny, in a 1964 revival of the dance. Miss Ide also choreographed occasionally.         She made her Broadway debut in 1930 as a leading dancer in "Lysistrata" and was featured in "As Thousands Cheer," "Life Begins at 8:40" and "Americana."         Miss Ide was married to Victor M. Ratner, who died in 1974.         In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Dr. Stephanie LaFarge of Hastings-on-Hudson; her companion, Len Tillett of Norwich, England; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Susan K. Johnson, the senior vice president for account management at Mediamark Research Inc., a Manhattan-based media and market research company, died on Friday at the New York Hospital Medical Center of Queens. She was 46 and lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was meningitis, said her husband, Leonard Gelstein.         Ms. Johnson joined the company, which carries out research on subjects like magazine readership, in 1989. She was previously a vice president and associate media director of Backer Spielvogel Bates Worldwide Inc., a Manhattan-based advertising agency.         At her death, she was also vice president of the Media Research Directors Association.         She was born in Wilmington, Del., graduated from Tower Hill School there and earned a B.A. in psychology from Vassar College in 1969.         In addition to her husband, whom she married in 1984, she is survived by their daughter, Megan Elizabeth Gelstein; her mother, Kathryn Johnson of Brooklyn; and a sister, Janet Grimminger of Townsend, Del.       
         Elizabeth Boatwright Coker, a writer of historical novels, died on Wednesday in Byerly Hospital here. She was 84.         Her family said she suffered a stroke last weekend, her family said.         Mrs. Coker was the widow of James Lide Coker 3d, former president of the Sonoco Products Company. She was a 1929 graduate of Converse College in Spartanburg and was a life member of the college's board of trustees.         Critics described Mrs. Coker as a romanticist who found her plots, heroes and heroines in the legends and family histories of her native South Carolina. She was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame in 1992 for her contributions to the state and to American culture and history.         Her novels, all published by E. P. Dutton , included "The Day of the Peacock" (1952), "India Allan" (1953), "The Big Drum" (1957), "La Belle" (1959), "Lady Rich" (1963) and "The Bees: A Story of a Family" (1968). Her first novel, "Daughter of Strangers," was published in 1950.         She also contributed poetry, essays and short stories to various magazines.         Mrs. Coker was born in Darlington on April 21, 1909, the daughter of Purvis Jenkins and Bessie Heard Boatwright.         She is survived by a daughter, Penelope Coker Hall of Millbrook, N.Y.; a son, James L. Coker 4th of Stonington, Conn., and Charleston, and two granddaughters.       
         Lillian Ruth Kessler, founder of the Kessler International Corporation, which exports railroad parts, electronics and heavy industrial equipment to Asia, Africa and South America, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Washington. She was 85.         Her daughter, Elinor Fuchs, said her mother had Alzheimer's disease.         Ms. Kessler founded the company in 1946. It is now based in Rockville, Md.         Before she established the business Ms. Kessler served for a year as an analyst for the Foreign Economic Administration, a Federal agency, conducting studies of postwar industrialization in Ethiopia and China. She then worked as an industrial economist for an international engineering firm and as a foreign markets consultant for the Sinclair Oil Corporation. W.P.A. History Project         While still a doctoral student in economic history in what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ms. Kessler was asked to direct a pilot history project for the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal program established in 1935 to provide employment through public works projects; eventually, the history project grew into the W.P.A.'s Historical Records Survey.         Ms. Kessler was named the director of the project for Ohio in 1939. During her work with the W.P.A. she wrote a guidebook to American folk songs, "Songs of Yesterday: A Song Anthology of American Life," with Philip D. Jordan.         She was born in Cleveland and attended Radcliffe College before enrolling at the Cleveland university, where she received an undergraduate degree in 1929.         In 1930 she married Joseph Fuchs, the violinist, who was then with the Cleveland Orchestra. They divorced in 1940.         Besides her daughter, Ms. Kessler is survived by a brother, Dr. Edwin S. Kessler of Washington, and two granddaughters.       
         Nadia Stark, a founder and president of the Stark Carpet Corporation in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at Sloan-Kettering Memorial Hospital. She was 81.         The cause was cancer, family members said.         Mrs. Stark, who was a fashion model in the 1930's, designed women's hats for several years before helping her husband, Arthur Stark, found Stark Carpets in 1935. The company caters primarily to decorators and their clientele, and has provided carpet designs for the White House, the Smithsonian Institution and Gracie Mansion.         Mrs. Stark was active in the operation of the company until her illness forced her to retire early this year. Her sons, Steven and John, now run the company, which also imports rugs and manufactures other types of floor coverings.         After Mr. Stark died in 1968, Mrs. Stark married Dr. David Anderman, an eye surgeon. He died in 1978. Mrs. Stark then married Theodore Silbert, chairman of the board of Sterling National Bank, who died last year.         Mrs. Stark is survived by her sons, both of Manhattan; a sister, Bea Zolt of Manhattan; two brothers, Mitchell and Bernard Snitkim, both of Miami, and five grandchildren.       
         Joan Sibley, a fashion designer whose work is included in the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Tuesday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset. She was 52.         The cause was Burkitt's lymphoma, a rare form of cancer, said her husband, Peter Powell.         Ms. Sibley started her career in a small design studio she established on East 58th Street in Manhattan. She founded Sibley Coffee Ltd. with a fellow designer, Dory Coffee, in 1966. The company's popular silk jersey body dresses were sold in stores like Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus, and private customers included Jacqueline Onassis, Babe Paley and Candice Bergen.         Born in Gipsy, Pa., she attended the Moore College of Art in Philadelphia and received a fellowship to travel and study in Europe, where she attended design classes at the Sorbonne.         Sibley Coffee was made a part of the Bendel's Studio Group in 1973 and closed in 1977. Ms. Sibley went on to work as associate designer for Ellen Tracy until 1980, when she left to work as a display designer and sales representative for Yale Burg, an antiques importing company in Manhattan.         She is survived by her husband and a son, Gus Powell, who attends Oberlin College in Ohio.       
         Mary E. Clark, a lawyer who successfully campaigned for a change in Florida law so that people with major illnesses would not lose a large part of their medical insurance coverage, died here on Saturday. She was 37.         The cause was colon cancer, said her husband, Keith Westerberg.         After discovering she had cancer in 1988, Ms. Clark thought her group insurance policy would cover her medical expenses up to $1 million. But after she retired because of her health, she discovered that her $1 million policy had been reduced to $250,000.         She took her case to court and to the public. Statewide Campaign         For four years she traveled across the state, arguing before newspaper editorial boards and at legislative meetings that insurance companies should not be able to reduce the medical benefits of people forced to retire because of illness.         She also sued her insurance company and won the right to medical benefits up to $1 million. But that decision was overturned on appeal.         In 1992, however, she persuaded the Legislature to increase minimum lifetime medical insurance benefits for individuals to $500,000.         "Most people in Mary's position do not have the time, energy, financial resources or legal resources to contest this sort of inequity," Mr. Westerberg said. "Mary did, and she helped change this unfair law for everyone."         Born in Washington, she moved to Sarasota to attend New College and later studied law at the University of Virginia. She was the managing attorney with Gulfcoast Legal Services, providing legal aid to people who were unable to afford lawyers.         In addition to her husband, survivors include her parents, William M. and Dorothy Clark of Arlington, Va., and a brother, John, of Sarasota.       
         Fran Carlon, an actress who worked in radio, television, films and theater, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Casey Allen.         Miss Carlon began her career in the early 1930's, playing Little Eva in a touring company of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." She went on to Hollywood and acted in films with Loretta Young, Douglas Montgomery and the Ritz Brothers before turning to radio drama, appearing in shows like "Lorenzo Jones" and "Our Gal Sunday." She also played Lorelei Kilbourne on the radio show "Big Town."         Her Broadway credits included "Sunrise at Campobello" and "Men of Distinction." On television, she played the title character on "Portia Faces Life" and was Julia Burke for six years on "As the World Turns."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Kim Allen of Minneapolis; a son, Kerry Allen of New York City; a sister, Mary Behr, and two grandchildren.       
         Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress and philanthropist whose bittersweet life was woven of luxury, disputes and interludes of deep unhappiness, died yesterday at her house in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80 and had her main residence in Somerset County, N.J. She also had homes on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, in Newport, R.I., and Hawaii.         The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Bernard Lafferty, a friend and adviser to Miss Duke who was with her at her death.         Her manifold interests as a philanthropist ranged from animal rights to AIDS, historical preservation to orchids. By some accounts she was an astute manager of her assets, and a person familiar with her affairs said that she had left nearly all her estate of more than $1 billion to charity.         Late one evening in Rome in 1945, Miss Duke, who was then 33 years old, told a friend that her vast fortune was in some ways a barrier to happiness.         "All that money is a problem sometimes," Miss Duke told her companion, a young American journalist, over a glass of wine at the Hassler Hotel. "It happens every time. After I've gone out with a man a few times, he starts to tell me how much he loves me. But how can I know if he really means it? How can I ever be sure?" An Inheritance With a Double Edge         At that stage of her life, Miss Duke, then between marriages and working as a foreign correspondent based in Rome, was known and liked by other American expatriates for her friendly, unassuming ways, her warmth, and her love of jazz and ballroom dancing. But her words that night showed that her life had been profoundly affected, even scarred, by her wealth.         Miss Duke was not only rich; she was also thought for years to be the richest woman in the world. And she had that reputation during the Depression, when her wealth stood out in especially stark contrast to widespread poverty and suffering. As a result, she was always a celebrity, and one who literally stood out, standing six feet one inch tall.         Her millions, and the elegant life they made possible, seemed to be of great importance to her two husbands, James H. R. Cromwell, an American sportsman and advertising man, and Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican playboy and diplomat. She divorced them both.         The Duke millions also attracted cranks and photographers and ordinary curious people, and to avoid them Miss Duke lived a partly secluded life in her later years. In recent years, she traveled extensively and spent much time in Somerville, Newport, Hawaii and Beverly Hills. A Generous Giver With Many Interests         Her many philanthropic activities included paying for the restoration of numerous old buildings in Newport. She also established the Duke Gardens Foundation at Somerville in 1958. The Duke Gardens' trellised greenhouses, open to the public part of each year, contain French, English, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Islamic gardens and a collection of rare orchids.         As a philanthropist, Miss Duke was also active in support of environmental causes and animal rights. This year she contributed $2 million for AIDS research at Duke University in Durham, N.C., which was named for her family, and $1 million to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.         In addition, she was the president of the Doris Duke Foundation, based in Somerville, whose areas of interest have ranged from social and health services to cultural programs. The foundation reported $775,000 in charitable contributions in the 1992 fiscal year.         The president of Duke University, Nannerl O. Keohane, said yesterday, in a statement released by the university, that Miss Duke's "recent gift in support of AIDS research at Duke is but one of many programs here that she supported, from our Primate Center to other programs across the campus." She added: "Many of her gifts were made anonymously."         A spokesman for the university, John F. Burness, declined to say what, if anything, it might receive from Miss Duke's estate.         In an act of personal generosity in 1988 that involved an old friend, Miss Duke posted $5 million bail for Imelda Marcos, the wife of the former Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos, who died in 1989. Mrs. Marcos had been indicted in New York on Federal racketeering charges.         At various times, Miss Duke's millions, and the publicity they generated, also helped to draw her into lawsuits and disputes, including tax litigation in New Jersey, the site of her 2,700-acre estate, Duke Farms. In 1964, she took legal action in Hawaii to obtain a court order forbidding a jazz musician, Joseph Castro, from maintaining, as had been rumored, that he was her husband. A Bomber for Travel And Clean Kitchens         Her fortune also made possible many pleasures, large and small. She once bought a B-25 bomber and had it refurbished for luxury travel. She had her Hawaii house fixed up with ceiling-high goldfish tanks.         She entertained gracefully there and at her various other residences and tried to put shy guests at their ease. As a hostess, she was calm, quiet and a little shy herself, friends said, although she was sometimes angered by sloppiness in the kitchen, as in other realms.         Miss Duke liked fine porcelain and jewels and enjoyed building her jewelry collection, which included notable Indian pieces and heirlooms from her mother. She liked to bake, and friends said her whole-wheat bread was delicious. She enjoyed relaxing, now and then, with a glass of white wine or a spot of Champagne.         Nonetheless, Miss Duke seemed to experience more than her share of unhappiness. Beyond the two divorces, there was the death of her father, the multimillionaire James Buchanan Duke, in 1925, when she was 12 years old. In July 1940, her premature daughter, her only child, died in a Honolulu hospital after only 24 hours of life.         And in 1966 there was the accidental death of Eduardo Tirella, an interior decorator who was a close friend, when the car she was driving slammed him against a gate on Rough Point, the Newport estate. Fenced with barbed wire and guarded, Rough Point was part of her inheritance from her father, known as Buck, who was president of the American Tobacco Company and had other extensive business interests. A Father's Fortune And a Young Heir         What made Miss Duke so enormously rich was the fact that she was his only child. She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 22, 1912, to his second wife, Nanaline Lee Holt Inman Duke.         Miss Duke, a shy, golden-haired child, had private tutors and for a time attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, where her father had built a three-story, 54-room mansion on the northeast corner of 78th Street and Fifth Avenue. The building now houses the Fine Arts Institute of New York University.         When Mr. Duke died, his total estate was valued at more than $100 million. His daughter's share of the estate was appraised in 1927 at more than $50 million, most of it in trust funds.         As a teen-ager and a young woman, Miss Duke spent much of her time at the 78th Street mansion, to which she sometimes referred jauntily in later years as "the rock pile." She took piano lessons, was tutored in French and Italian, went out to dinner at fashionable restaurants, and frequently went to the theater, although to avoid crowds she did not go to opening nights.         She also acquired a love of travel that was to stay with her through her life.         Miss Duke, who was known to some as Dee-Dee, was guarded by private detectives and sometimes traveled under an assumed name. "It saves trouble," she once said, "and keeps people from paying more attention to me than to anyone else."         Nevertheless, she was continually harassed by cranks, and there was some fear that she might be kidnapped.         Her half-brother, Walker Patterson Inman, who often traveled with her, once said: "Everywhere we go, it's the same. She gets to see a few of the sights, goes out to dinner a few times, and then her identity becomes known and we have to rush off somewhere else. We can't take any chances. When word gets out that she's in town, it's like telling gangsters: 'Here's a lot of money. Come and get it.' "         "But that's not the worst of it," he added. "Mail comes in by the bagful, and every crank in town wants to see her. Every imaginable plea for money comes by mail, to say nothing of threats against her because she's supposed to have so much money."         In hopes of seeing her, reporters gathered outside the 78th Street mansion on the evening of Nov. 21, 1933, but she eluded them and slipped out for a quiet dinner with friends. What made that night newsworthy, it was reported at the time, was that at the stroke of midnight, when she turned 21, she acquired control of one-third of the assets that had been held in trust for her.         Although no precise figures were released, it was estimated that the total value of her inheritance had shrunk by then, because of the financial crash and the Depression, to roughly $30 million. As stipulated in her father's will, Miss Duke acquired control over additional large parts of her inheritance on her 25th and 30th birthdays. Tobacco Queen As Married Woman         Soon after turning 21, Miss Duke began being seen in the company of a dashing, strong-jawed older man. It was James Cromwell, the son and grandson of prominent yachtsmen and the stepson of a partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company.         Mr. Cromwell and Miss Duke had first met in 1929 in Bar Harbor, Me., when she was a long-legged teen-ager and he was already 10 years out of the University of Pennsylvania.         Rumors of an engagement blossomed, were denied, blossomed again. And then, with little advance notice, the couple were married in a civil ceremony on Feb. 13, 1935, in the 78th Street house. The bride was 22, the groom 38. They sailed off on a prolonged honeymoon.         Visiting Agra, the Indian city that is the site of the Taj Mahal, the bride told a a questioner happily, "I'm a married woman now," and remarked that she did not like it when people called her "the world's richest girl" and "the tobacco queen."         "Tobacco queen -- what a name!" she said.         Back in the United States, the Cromwells set up housekeeping in ducal style at Duke Farms, with its 30-room stone manor house, its private movie theater (she loved movies) and 42 miles of private roads. For a change of scene, they built an elegant vacation house on the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.         As time passed, relations between the Cromwells soured, and after protracted legal wranglings Mrs. Cromwell was granted a divorce in Reno in 1943 on grounds of cruelty. She resumed the use of her maiden name. Later, she testified that Mr. Cromwell had demanded an "endowment" of $7 million in return for the divorce. Learning to Work And Enjoying It         In 1944, Miss Duke went to Egypt to help the United States war effort by working, for $1 a year, for the United Seaman's Service, which operated canteens for American merchant seamen.         "I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something real to help in this war," she said at the time. "This may sound funny, but I honestly believe I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life. I feel I'm doing something worthwhile, earning the right to be friends with a lot of swell, interesting people that I've somehow missed before. I've discovered, I guess, that it's fun to work."         Relishing the overseas life, she went on to Europe, where she wrote dispatches in 1945 and 1946 for International News Service, an American news agency that is now defunct, getting around Rome on a bicycle.         Miss Duke was entertaining an American couple in her Rome apartment one day when a suave and handsome Latin American came to call. He was carrying a guitar, which he was to play while she accompanied him on the piano. It was Porfirio Rubirosa, the high-spirited Dominican society figure.         The harmony beween Mr. Rubirosa and Miss Duke proved so compelling that they were married on Sept. 1, 1947, in a civil ceremony at the Dominican Consulate in Paris, where she had gone to work for Harper's Bazaar magazine. He was 39; she was 34. By some accounts the formalities included the bridegroom's signing a legal document that affirmed the bride's control over her fortune.         They spent their honeymoon at Cap d'Antibes, on the French Riviera, where they swam, sunbathed and went motorboating. Not long afterward, he became the Dominican Republic's Ambassador in Buenos Aires.         Despite his charm, the marriage foundered. Miss Duke obtained a Reno divorce from Rubirosa on Oct. 27, 1948, after charging him with extreme mental cruelty.         As time went on it became clear that Miss Duke preferred to remain single. The life she fashioned for herself was largely centered on her estates, and it involved some frivolity and some high seriousness, along with much unobtrusive travel.         It included both new and old interests. She served as a trustee of Duke University, which her family had built up with donations of many millions, and in her later years she became fascinated by the search for alternative sources of energy. Cultivating Gardens And Saving History         At Duke Farms, she laid out a series of interconnected, glassed-in gardens, totaling thousands of square yards, that were opened to the public in 1964 after much labor by her and her workers.         "Sometimes when we're hanging the flowers I spend 16 hours a day," she once told a friend, adding cheerfully, "I work like a stevedore."         She also had a small museum set up on the New Jersey estate to house her collection of Asian art.         Over the years, Miss Duke and the foundation that bore her name made contributions to many other causes, ranging from the advancement of Russian studies at Princeton University to architectural restoration in Newport. She poured millions into the Preservation Society of Newport County, whose mission was to reclaim the city's rundown 18th-century buildings.         The project was welcomed by many Newporters because, among other reasons, it enhanced property values. They were careful to respect Miss Duke's desire for quiet and privacy, and some came to refer to her, almost reverentially, as "the lady."         In 1988, when she was 75, Miss Duke adopted Charlene Gail Heffner, then 35, a former adherent of the Hare Krishna religious group. But by February 1991, Ms. Heffner, known as Chandi, had become persona non grata at Miss Duke's residences, according to an unauthorized biography of Miss Duke, "The Richest Girl in the World" (Putnam, 1992), by Stephanie Mansfield. The author wrote that Miss Duke told a friend later that adopting Ms. Heffner had been "the greatest mistake I ever made."         Later, Ms. Heffner sued Miss Duke for breach of contract. This month, a New Jersey judge ruled against lawyers for Miss Duke, who had sought to have the suit dismissed.         Miss Heffner survives, as does Miss Duke's nephew, Walker Inman Jr. of Georgetown, S.C., and several cousins.       
         Charlotte O'Keefe Pepe, head of Chemicolloid Laboratories of Garden City Park, L.I., died on Thursday while attending a business meeting in Paris. She was 83 and lived in Garden City.         Her family said the cause was a heart attack.         Chemicolloid Laboratories was founded by Mrs. Pepe with her first husband, David O'Keefe, who died before her. The company exports equipment for industrial and food processing.         Mrs. Pepe is survived by her second husband, Anthony C. Pepe.       
         Josephine Jablons, a board member of the New York City Opera Company, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69 and also had a home in Palm Beach, Fla.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Jablons helped found the City Opera Guild in 1959 and for six years served as its president. She led it when the opera celebrated its new home at Lincoln Center with a lavish gala in 1966. She had been on the board of the City Opera since its days at City Center on West 55th Street. She was elected a director of the City Opera Company in July.         A native of Albany and a graduate of Skidmore College, Mrs. Jablons began her career in journalism and public relations. She spent 14 years as a reporter and editor of The New York Herald Tribune in Paris and in New York, covering travel, society, the arts and other subjects.         She also took part in Democratic Party affairs. She was active recently in several organizations helping immigrants.         She is survived by her husband, J. Mitchell Jablons; a daughter, Pamela Jablons of Manhattan; a son, Dr. David Jablons of San Francisco, and a sister, Grace Burke of Colonie, N.Y.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Mary Luke, a biographer who wrote about Tudor and Elizabethan figures, died yesterday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Ridgefield, Conn.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Luke wrote "Catherine, the Queen" (1967), a portrait of Henry VIII's hapless first wife, Catherine of Aragon. "A Crown for Elizabeth" (1970) limned the turbulent years between 1527, when Henry maneuvered for a divorce from Catherine for lack of a male heir, and 1558, when Elizabeth I ascended to the throne.         In a review of "A Crown for Elizabeth" for The New York Times, Lady Antonia Fraser wrote, "To the sympathetic retelling of history, Mrs. Luke has made a notable contribution and one that will give much pleasure to its readers."         "The Nine Days Queen: A Portrait of Lady Jane Grey" (1986) told the story of Jane Grey's brief hold on the scepter in July 1553 and her subsequent martyrdom. Mrs. Luke also wrote a novel, "The Nonsuch Lure" (1976), and "The Ivy Crown: A Biographical Novel of Queen Katherine Paar" (1984).         Born in Pittsfield, Mass., Mrs. Luke, whose original name was Mary Munger, graduated from Berkshire Business School and worked in advertising in New York, and later for a documentary film company and RKO Studios in Hollywood.         Mrs. Luke's marriage to the late David L. Luke Jr., a corporate executive, ended in divorce. She is survived by a daughter, Melinda C. Luke, also of Ridgefield; four brothers, John, Donald, Clifford and Raymond Munger, all of Pittsfield; two sisters, Dorothy Panzeri of Canaan, N.Y., and Ruth Durant of Pittsfield, and two granddaughters.       
         Jacqueline Shearer, a producer and director of documentary films about black Americans, died yesterday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 46.         The cause was colon cancer, said her brother Clement.         Ms. Shearer's works included "A Minor Altercation" (1978), about the Boston school-busing crisis; "The Keys to the Kingdom" and "The Promised Land" (1989), which were in the civil-rights television series "Eyes on the Prize," and "The Colored 54th Regiment" (1991) for the PBS series "The American Experience."         Ms. Shearer was born in Boston and graduated from Brandeis University. She helped found Boston Newsreel, a documentary company, and worked at WCBN radio and WCVB television in Boston.         Besides her brother Clement, of Northfield, Minn., she is survived by her mother, Erline, of Boston; two sisters, Debbie, of Boston, and Linda Gossage, of San Francisco; and another brother, Charles, of Boston.       
         Evelyn Venable, an actress whose films include "Death Takes a Holiday" with Fredric March, died on Nov. 16 in Post Falls, Idaho. She was 80.         Miss Venable was born in Cincinnati. After attending Vassar College and the University of Cincinnati, she played Shakespearean roles in a theater company headed by Walter Hampden. She made her first film, "Cradle Song," for Paramount in 1933; others were "Mrs. Wiggs of the Cabbage Patch" (1934), "Alice Adams" (1935), "The Little Colonel" (1935) and "The Frontiersman" (1938). She was also the voice of the Blue Fairy in Walt Disney's "Pinocchio" (1940). She retired from the screen after making "He Hired the Boss" in 1943.         For many years she lectured in classics at the University of California at Los Angeles, where she earned a bachelor's and a master's degree in Latin in the 1950's.         She was married to Hal Mohr, a cinematographer, who died in 1974. She is survived by her daughters, Rosalia and Dolores.       
         Lucia Popp, a lyric soprano who sang with a silken clarity that made her a favorite in Mozart and Strauss roles, died yesterday in Munich, Germany. She was 54 and lived in Zurich.         The cause was a brain tumor, said Mariedi Anders, her manager.         An elegant, flexible interpreter whose voice had a light, transparent texture, Miss Popp brought emotional depth and perspective to a wide variety of roles. Early in her career, her accurate, silvery coloratura made her an ideal Queen of the Night in Mozart's "Magic Flute." Later, as her voice matured and grew more rounded, she made an affecting Pamina in the same work.         She sang all the major soprano roles in a Mozart cycle staged by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle in Cologne in the 1970's, and recorded many of them. She was also exceptional as both Sophie and the Marschallin in Strauss's "Rosenkavalier." But although Mozart and Strauss were specialties, Miss Popp's repertory also included everything from Handel oratorios and Mahler symphonies to Janacek, Puccini and Wagner operas. She was also an incomparably communicative recitalist. Her last performances were recitals in Vienna, Dresden and Frankfurt in late September and early October. Austrian Honors         Miss Popp was born in Uhorska Ves, Czechoslovakia, on Nov. 12, 1939. She studied at Bratislava Academy and made her professional debut in 1963 as the Queen of the Night at the National Theater in Bratislava. The same year she made her debut as Barbarina in Mozart's "Marriage of Figaro" at the Vienna State Opera, and remained a mainstay of that company's roster for the rest of her life. She was honored several times by the Austrian Government (she held an Austrian passport), which gave her the title Kammersangerin.         Also in 1963, Miss Popp made her first appearance at the Salzburg Festival, and made her first important recording, a "Magic Flute" conducted by Otto Klemperer. A debut at Covent Garden followed in 1966, and in 1967 she made her Metropolitan Opera debut as the Queen of the Night. Her other Met roles include Sophie and Pamina.         Miss Popp made more than 75 recordings. Among those available on compact disk are Mozart's "Clemenza di Tito" (Philips Records), "The Magic Flute" (Angel); Beethoven's "Fidelio" (Deutsche Grammophon); Janacek's "Cunning Little Vixen" and "Jenufa" (both on London); Donizetti's "Elisir d'Amore" (RCA); two recordings of Johann Strauss Jr.'s "Fledermaus" (Angel and Deutsche Grammophon), and Strauss's "Rosenkavalier" (Sony Classical), "Daphne," "Intermezzo" and "Four Last Songs" (Angel).         She is survived by her husband, the tenor Peter Sieffert, and her father.       
         Dorothy Raedler, a stage director, choreographer and impresario who specialized in the works of Gilbert and Sullivan, died last Saturday at her home in St. Croix in the United States Virgin Islands. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, The Associated Press reported.         Miss Raedler's company, which began as Masque and Lyre Light Opera in 1939 and became the American Savoyards in 1952, was a highly regarded fixture in the New York musical world through the late 1960's. Miss Raedler began her work modestly, first directing her Gilbert and Sullivan productions in the homes of company members, then moving to the basement of the Jan Hus House on East 74th Street, and eventually to larger theaters. In the 1960's, she directed productions for the City Center Gilbert and Sullivan Company, the New York City Opera and the Baltimore Civic Opera.         Miss Raedler was born in New York. She organized the Masque and Lyre company as an amateur troupe during her student years at Hunter College and reorganized it as a semi-professional company in 1948. From the start, the company earned enthusiastic reviews from both music and drama critics, and it began to operate year round. In 1952, after a visit to England to research Gilbert and Sullivan traditions, she renamed the company the American Savoyards and took "The Mikado" and "Patience" on a cross-country tour. The following year, she instituted a summer season in Monmouth, Me.         Besides the Gilbert and Sullivan repertory, she directed productions of "Madama Butterfly," "Carmen," "The Merry Widow" and operettas by Victor Herbert, Franz Lehar and Rudolf Friml.         Miss Raedler was on the original board of the Harlem School of the Arts and helped found the St. Croix School of the Arts. She lived in St. Croix for 25 years and occasionally directed performances there, including a production of Scott Joplin's opera, "Treemonisha."         She is survived by her sister, Florence Storm of Big Rapids, Mich.       
         Elizabeth L. R. Coates, a Connecticut lawyer active in community affairs, died on Thursday at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was 44 and lived in New Canaan, Conn.         The cause was a viral infection following a bone marrow transplant, said her husband, Charles E. Coates 3d.         Mrs. Coates was born in Salem, Mass., was an honors graduate of Wellesley College and received her law degree from Boston University. She worked for the General Electric Company as a lawyer for seven years before going into private practice in Greenwich, most recently with the firm of Hopper & Krause.         She was a past president and board chairman of the New Canaan Community Nursery School, president of the Southern Connecticut Wellesley Club and an elder of the First Presbyterian Church of New Canaan. She also was a supporter of South School in New Canaan, where she was an officer of the Parent-Teacher Council.         Besides her husband, also a lawyer in Greenwich, Mrs. Coates's survivors are her three daughters, Susanna, Margaret and Catherine; her parents, Donald T. and Betty Richardson of Fairfield, Conn.; and her three sisters, Susan R. Duncan of Simsbury, Conn., Leslie B. Richardson of Yardley, Pa., and Lisa Richardson-Bach of Marblehead, Mass.       
         Alice Tully, a philanthropist who was an important figure in New York City's musical life for almost half a century, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Her lawyer, James McGarry, said the cause was the flu. She had not been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 1991.         Miss Tully, for whom Lincoln Center's chamber-music hall is named, was as respected for her knowledge of music and its practitioners as for her generosity.         As a singer who had a modest operatic and recital career in the 1930's, she was keenly aware of the problems performers face, and throughout her life was a friend and supporter of singers, pianists and composers. After she inherited her family's wealth -- her maternal grandfather was Amory Houghton, the founder of Corning Glass Works -- she donated many millions of dollars to the arts. A Birthday Portrait         For many years Miss Tully made her contributions anonymously, and when she agreed to underwrite a chamber-music hall in the Juilliard Building at Lincoln Center, she stipulated that her name not be associated with it. Eventually, John D. Rockefeller 3d, Lincoln Center's first chairman, persuaded her to allow the hall to be named in her honor. In 1987, to celebrate her 85th birthday, Lincoln Center commissioned Thomas Buechner to paint a full-length portrait of her, which hangs in the hall's main foyer. Miss Tully always refused to tell how much of the hall's cost she contributed, but she did not dispute reports that said she paid most of the $4.5 million.         She did say that one reason she was hesitant to accept the hall's dedication at first was that Philharmonic Hall and the New York State Theater had been acoustical disasters. "I did not want my name associated with a hall that would have bad acoustics," she told an interviewer in 1987. She changed her mind when Lincoln Center engaged Heinrich Keilholz, who had revamped Severance Hall in Cleveland in 1958, as acoustician.  More Space, Fewer Seats         She took an active hand in the hall's design, selecting the colors of the walls, seat covering and foyer carpeting. She paid particular attention to adequate leg room.         "I had spent so many, many hours cramped in narrow spaces, both here and in Europe, and I felt that this was something we should have," she said in the 1987 interview. "The architects disagreed, because what I wanted would have meant having three fewer rows. So I went to William Schuman, who was president of Lincoln Center at the time, and I said: 'You're a tall man. Wouldn't you like to sit comfortably? Do let us have one comfortable hall in New York City.' "         Mr. Schuman agreed, Miss Tully said. "So I drew a breath of relief. But I had to keep my eye on it just the same."         Later, after much personal research in Europe, she was deeply involved in selecting the Theodore Kuhn Company to build the hall's organ, which experts said cost well over $250,000.         When the hall was in the planning stages, Miss Tully encouraged the creation of its resident ensemble, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and was the chairwoman of its board for many years. She also served on the boards of the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and the Juilliard School of Music. Myriad Beneficiaries         In addition to her involvement with Lincoln Center, Miss Tully was an active supporter of dance, art and humanitarian organizations. She gave generously to the Martha Graham Dance Company and Eliot Feld's ballet troupe, and she was a board member of numerous other arts and educational institutions. She contributed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Frick Collection and the Morgan Library, among others.         Michael J. Spencer, a pianist who founded Hospital Audiences, which provides access to the arts for the disabled, said yesterday that when he began playing concerts in state mental hospitals in the 1960's he sought funds everywhere and only one organization responded. "It was something called the Maya Corporation, and it was only in the early 70's that I found out it was Alice Tully providing the funds." Miss Tully had founded the corporation to disperse cash gifts anonymously. Mr. Spencer added that he received a Maya donation only last week.         Miss Tully never wanted the extent of her largesse known. Irwin Scherzer, the manager of the Chamber Music Society in its early days and a close friend of Miss Tully, said: "She wouldn't know herself how much money she had donated. She did what she thought was best, where she thought it would do the most good."         Alice Bigelow Tully was born on Sept. 11, 1902, in Corning, N.Y. Her father, William J. Tully, was a lawyer and a two-term New York State senator. The actress Katharine Hepburn is her second cousin. When Mr. Tully became general counsel to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1908, the family moved to New York City, where Miss Tully attended Mrs. J. D. Randall MacIvor's School. Later she continued her studies at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn.  A Recital Inspired Her         Miss Tully often said that she decided to devote herself to music when she was 14 or 15 years old, after hearing a recital by the pianist Josef Hofmann. But although piano studies were part of her schooling, her first musical love was singing. In 1922, after studying voice in New York for three years, she went to Paris for seven years of study with Jean Perier, the baritone who created the role of Pelleas in Debussy's opera "Pelleas et Melisande," and with Miguel Fontecha and Therese Leschetizky.         Beginning as a mezzo-soprano and then moving to the dramatic soprano repertory, Miss Tully made her professional debut in 1927, when she sang works by Gluck, Franck, Chausson and Faure with the Pasdeloup Orchestra in Paris. Six years later she made her operatic debut at the Hippodrome in New York, singing Santuzza -- her best role, by her own estimation -- in a Salmaggi Opera production of Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana."         She also sang the title role in a production of Bizet's "Carmen" at the Manhattan Opera House in 1935, and through the late 1930's she performed frequently as a recitalist in Europe and the United States. Reviewing a 1937 Town Hall recital in The New York Times, Olin Downes wrote that Miss Tully's program was of "rare interest and artistic distinction" and praised her "musicianly zeal and catholicity of taste."         Miss Tully, looking back on her career in a 1982 interview with Harold C. Schonberg of The Times, said: "It may not have been the biggest career, but it was a good one. I was always concerned with the best in music, and I think I had something individual to offer."  Avid Amateur Pilot         With the outbreak of World War II, Miss Tully settled permanently in New York and continued her vocal studies. But she suspended her career to devote herself to the war effort. An avid amateur pilot, she joined the Civil Air Patrol and flew on submarine scouting missions. But she decided to "be of more use" and became a Red Cross nurse's aid at the French Hospital in Manhattan.         In 1950, Miss Tully stopped singing professionally because, she later said, she felt that her voice was losing its flexibility. Upon the death of her mother, Clara Houghton Tully, in 1958, Miss Tully inherited a substantial estate, and began her career as a philanthropist. It was at about that time that her cousin, Arthur Houghton Jr., one of the founders of Lincoln Center, approached her with the idea of contributing toward the concert hall that now bears her name.         The hall opened on Miss Tully's 67th birthday, Sept. 11, 1969, with a program by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. It was judged a superb setting for chamber music, both acoustically and visually, and the most successful of Lincoln Center's concert halls.         Miss Tully, who never married, was a tall, slender, regal woman with a friendly smile, a wry sense of humor, and a comprehensive knowledge of musical literature and the world of performers. After chamber music and art songs, her love was opera, particularly Wagner, and well into her 80's she regularly traveled to Europe to see new productions, keep track of singers and directors, and serve on competition juries. She was especially fond of the Spoleto Festival in Italy; its founder, Gian Carlo Menotti, wrote "Cantilene e Scherzo" and "Nocturne" for her. Others who dedicated works to her include Mr. Schuman, who wrote "A Round for Alice," and Riccardo Malipiero, who composed "Serenata per Alice Tully." Recipient of Many Honors         In 1970, Miss Tully was awarded a Handel Medallion, New York City's highest cultural award. She received the Gallatin Medal from New York University in 1976 for "contributions of lasting significance to society," was a recipient of the first National Medal of Arts in 1985, and received the American Red Cross Humanitarian Award in 1988. A devoted Francophile for most of her life, she received many honors from the French Government, and was made an officer in the French Legion of Honor.         Miss Tully's only sibling, a younger sister, Marion Tully Dimick of Washington, died in 1981.
