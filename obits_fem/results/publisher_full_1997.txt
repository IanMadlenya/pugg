         Edith Thacher Hurd, whose books on subjects from the earth to whales to firemen reached several generations of readers learning their way around the printed page, died on Saturday in Walnut Creek, Calif. She was 86.         Mrs. Hurd wrote some 75 books for elementary-school children covering the range of juvenile curiosity. Much of her work grew from a creative symbiosis with her husband, Clement Hurd, the artist and illustrator.         In the early 1930's, the couple were just out of college, she from Radcliffe, he from Yale and art school in Paris. They met in New York City while continuing their education at Bank Street College, and married in 1939.         She wrote and he drew the pictures for almost 50 books until their last collaboration on ''The Earth is Not Flat'' (1986). It was meant as a companion to a book Mr. Hurd had illustrated decades earlier, Gertrude Stein's ''The Earth Is Round,'' published in 1938. Clement Hurd died in 1988 at the age of 80.         Mrs. Hurd was born in Kansas City, Mo. At Bank Street College she also met Margaret Wise Brown, with whom she wrote several children's books under the joint pseudonym of Juniper Sage.         These included ''The Man in the Manhole and the Fix-It Men'' (1946), ''Five Little Firemen'' (1948), ''Two Little Miners'' (1949) and ''The Little Fat Policeman'' (1950). Clement Hurd also did illustrations for Mrs. Brown, who had persuaded him to enroll at Bank Street to try picture-book illustrations.         Mrs. Hurd's first solo writing effort, ''Hurry Hurry,'' was published in 1938 by W.R. Scott, a pioneer modern children's book publisher. A follow-up, ''Hurry Hurry: A Story of What Happened to a Hurrier,'' appeared in 1947.         The Hurds became regular contributors to the Harper ''I Can Read'' series. The titles there included ''Johnny Lion's Book,'' ''Come and Have Fun,'' ''Stop Stop'' and ''No Funny Business.''         Other titles included ''Christmas Eve,'' ''The Day the Sun Danced'' and ''Wilson's World,'' a cautionary environmental tale about a boy who paints a world but must draw it over again to make it better.         Mrs. Hurd also wrote science books for young readers, some of which were also illustrated by her husband. They included ''The Blue Heron Tree,'' ''Rain and the Valley,'' ''The Mother Whale'' and ''The Mother Deer.''         She is survived by a son, John Thacher Hurd of Berkeley, Calif., himself a writer and illustrator of children's books; and a brother, Nicholas Thacher, of San Francisco.       
         Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, a leading figure in the Democratic Party and for decades one of the most vivacious women on the international scene, died yesterday at the American Hospital in Paris of complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 76.         Mrs. Harriman, who was preparing to relinquish her post and return to Washington, suffered the hemorrhage on Monday at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, where she had gone for her usual swim.         She devoted her later years to helping to rebuild the Democratic Party in the 1980's, raising millions of dollars. She was appointed Ambassador by President Clinton in 1993, and was well regarded as a diplomat.         The President yesterday called her an ''extraordinary U.S. ambassador,'' adding, ''She was a source of judgment and inspiration to me, a source of constant good humor and charm and real friendship, and we will miss her very, very much.''         However great her accomplishments, she could never put to rest the legend of the captivating woman who snared some of the world's richest and most attractive men on two continents, marrying three of them.         Along the way she was trailed by a chorus of angry women who repeated tales of her escapades for decades.         Born in England in 1920 into an old aristocracy that no longer counted for much, she ultimately made her way into a new aristocracy of the wealthy and powerful that counted a great deal. She was 19 when she married Randolph Churchill. Within months he went off to war and she found herself at the center of London as a confidante and hostess for her new father-in-law, Winston Churchill. She called him Papa, and he reveled in her company.         Through Winston Churchill she met Max Beaverbrook, the press baron, who became her mentor; Harry Hopkins, Franklin D. Roosevelt's envoy, who became her friend, and W. Averell Harriman, the lend-lease administrator, who became her lover, and, 30 years later, her third husband.         With expenses underwritten by Mr. Harriman, she took up wartime residence in Grosvenor Square, a small parcel of London that became so filled with Americans that she remembered it as Eisenhowerplatz. There she brought prominent Americans and their British allies together for small dinners and raised eyebrows with her numerous liaisons. The most prominent among them were her London neighbor, John Hay (Jock) Whitney, who became the United States Ambassador to Britain, and Edward R. Murrow, the wartime voice of CBS in London.         After the war, divorced and the mother of a son, Winston Spencer Churchill, she moved to Paris where, with her customary energy and resourcefulness, and with the cachet and connections of the Churchill name, she established a glittering place for herself in international high society.         Later she moved on to America, where she charmed, and married, Leland Hayward, the renowned Broadway agent and producer. After Hayward's death Averell Harriman reappeared, and after a brief courtship they married and became the couple that helped reinvigorate the Democratic Party.         As a girl, Pamela Digby was peaches-and-cream pretty, but no great beauty. Taught, as were most girls of her class, that her goal was to marry well, she developed an exceptional ability to beguile men. She enveloped them in her attention, anticipated their every need and locked on them with adoring eyes that suggested genuine interest in their every word. When it was mentioned to one acquaintance that she was lacking a sense of humor, he shrugged and replied, ''Maybe, but she makes you feel you have the best sense of humor in the world.''         One of her biographers, Christopher Ogden, was beguiled himself when he described her on the night in November 1992 when she welcomed Bill Clinton, the new President she had helped to elect, to a dinner reception at her Georgetown house.         ''She looked fabulous, almost breathtaking,'' he wrote in his book ''Life of the Party.''         ''Her smile can appear too practiced but tonight it was wonderfully wise and guileless,'' he wrote. ''Her voice was low with a sexy, croacky catch.''         Not everyone agreed. Sally Bedell Smith, the author of another biography, ''Reflected Glory,'' said in 1996: ''She wanted great wealth and power. These were big ambitions for a person with little to say and no wit, but she had unflagging determination and ruthlessness.''         Mrs. Harriman was quick to deny that she had ever had an agenda. In 1996, in an interview in the Embassy residence in Paris, she said: ''My life, for me, has been free-flowing. I never thought, 'Now I'm here, I want to go there or do that.' I've taken life as it has presented itself to me.''         She bristled at the way she was characterized in the press and said she should not be faulted if the succession of men in her life happened to be rich and influential. ''Those were the people I met,'' she said. ''Everything in life, I believe, is luck and timing.''         Her first bit of luck was to be born, on March 20, 1920, to Edward Kenelm Digby, soon to become the 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, the former Constance Pamela Alice Bruce. She grew up at Minterne Magna, a 50-room stone mansion in Dorset, where despite severe financial pressures, the family's four children were tended to by maids, governesses and tutors.         She grew up in what she called ''a very small, closed society, the last of really 19th-century culture.''         The Startling Remaking Of a Country Girl         ''It's almost incredible to people I work with today,'' she said last year, ''to realize I was born in a world where a woman was totally controlled by men. I mean, you got married and there was kind of no alternative. The boys were allowed to go off to school. The girls were kept home, educated by governesses. It never sort of occurred to me in the first, I suppose, 20 years of my life that a woman could move from the position that pre-World War II women like me were in.''         She received a certificate in domestic science in 1936 from the Downham School in Hertfordshire. Then she was sent to Paris and Munich for ''finishing.'' As she approached the social season of 1938, when she was presented at court, she was still considered an unfashionable country girl.         Then Winston Churchill's only son, Randolph, well educated but spoiled and trailing a reputation for brilliance, arrogance, extravagance and drunkenness, took her to dinner and proposed on their first date, having already been turned down, according to the London gossips, by a number of other women. He was going off to war, told friends he was sure he would die, and wanted to produce an heir.         They were married on Oct. 4, 1939. ''I was absolutely sincere in wanting it to work,'' she said, ''and I still believe that if it hadn't been wartime, that marriage probably would have worked. I mean there's been too much exaggeration about Randolph being a drunk and Randolph being this and Randolph being that. He was his own worst enemy and very difficult to be his father's son and all that, but he had many, many admirable qualities.''         After following her husband to a succession of army camps, Pamela Churchill was taken under her father-in-law's wing. The Prime Minister found her enchanting. She brought him the London gossip and played the card game bezique with him into the early hours of the morning when he couldn't sleep. And he was elated that she was bearing his grandchild and namesake.         ''Nobody in today's generation can fully understand what it was like to be part of the last probably great war,'' she said, and years later she remembered it as the most exciting time of her life.         During bombing raids she shared the shelter under 10 Downing Street with the Prime Minister and his wife, Clementine. Above ground there were dinners and weekends with world leaders at Chequers or at Lord Beaverbrook's, tea dances at Claridges and the Dorchester, officers to entertain at the Churchill Club and Roosevelt's envoy, Harry Hopkins, to look after.         A Fling With Aly Khan, And Other Romances         After the war she became a reporter for Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Express and Evening Standard, cabling news about politics, the arts and the social scene from London, New York, Palm Beach, Montego Bay, Paris and the south of France.         She looked back at those postwar years as a time to ''catch up on all the things that I might have done if I hadn't had those six years of war,'' she said. ''I wanted to discover a lot of things that I had not done at the age of 19.''         She had a fling with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the Aga Kahn, and after the breakup of her marriage to Randolph Churchill she began her new life in Paris. There she met the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli and fell in love, and during their five-year romance provided him with connections in England and America. She converted to Catholicism in what some said was an effort to be a more acceptable bride to the heir to the Fiat fortune. But that was not to be.         After their breakup there were five years as mistress to Baron Elie de Rothschild of the French banking family. Because he was married to one of the most well-liked women in Paris society, Mrs. Churchill made enemies. But she had admirers, too, among them Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon.         ''I'm censured for having had friends,'' Mrs. Harriman said in 1996, assailing the many books and articles written about her, ''and, of course, more friends than I've ever really had. Men friends. The amount of people that I read about that I've slept with that I've never slept with -- I mean it's extraordinary!''         She insisted that she was not looking for a rich husband, saying of her biographers and detractors: ''The one thing that they've all missed is the fact that having once been married I said to myself, 'I don't have to get married again.' I was bruised. What annoys me, especially in this world where women are equal with men, why do they all take the same tack, that people didn't marry me? Nobody's ever thought that I didn't want to marry.''         But then she did marry, in 1960. During a visit to New York she was introduced to Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer of such hit musicals as ''South Pacific'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' A friend asked her to go to the theater with Hayward, whose wife, Slim, later known in New York society as Lady Keith, was in Europe. It was not long before Hayward proposed.         She showered him with what Sally Bedell Smith characterized as ''geisha-like devotion.'' She cooked chicken hash on a hot plate when they were out on the road and organized splendid houses in New York and Westchester, but theirs was a complicated marriage. Hayward had three children from his marriage to the actress Margaret Sullavan, who committed suicide in 1960, 11 years after their divorce. The children loved their mother and their first stepmother, but not their father's new wife.         When Hayward died of a stroke in 1971, there was a feud over his will. His daughter Brooke Hayward even suggested in her book, ''Haywire,'' that her last stepmother absconded with a string of pearls her mother had left to her. Pamela Harriman insisted that she knew nothing about the pearls.         As the Wife of Harriman, She Buoys the Democrats         Five months after Hayward's death, at a dinner party given by Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, there was a serendipitous reunion with W. Averell Harriman, who had been widowed the year before. A month later Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward, 51, married the 79-year-old former Governor of New York, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Harry Truman's choice to be President of the United States.         Although Harriman was the heir to the Union Pacific Railroad fortune, he was famously parsimonious. With his new wife, however, he was generous, and began to live up to his means. She fixed up his houses. She became an American citizen and adopted his interests in the Soviet Union and, more exuberantly, in the Democratic Party.         As Mrs. Averell Harriman, she gave fund-raising dinners for Democratic candidates in the 1970's. But it was the election of Ronald Reagan and the big Republican gains in Congress in the 1980 election that galvanized both Harrimans to action. To resuscitate the Democratic Party, they agreed to form their own political action committee, which quickly became known as PamPAC. Mrs. Harriman surrounded herself with advisers and learned quickly. She built up her political curriculum vitae, giving speeches and, with the help of friends, writing Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times and The Washington Post.         The Harriman house in Georgetown, with its fine collection of Impressionist works,  became a headquarters of sorts for the party in exile. Contributors paid thousands of dollars to be invited to Mrs. Harriman's receptions and dinners, where they were given briefings and allowed to rub shoulders with party nabobs like Clark Clifford and Robert Strauss and any number of Presidential candidates and senators, current and past.         When Harriman's health deteriorated, his wife worked assiduously to keep him occupied, making sure he had visitors to keep him company when she was away. By then Mrs. Harriman had her own airplane, so she was able to return to him in the evenings. He died in 1986 at the age of 94.         A $100 Million Fortune, And a Family Feud         There were two funeral services, one in New York and one in Washington, and two burials. Mourners thought they were witnessing his burial in the family plot next to his previous wife, Marie. In fact, The Washington Post later reported, Mrs. Harriman had postponed the actual interment for two months while another burial plot was prepared at his estate in Arden, N.Y. Pamela Harriman will be buried at his side, after a funeral service in Washington next Thursday and a memorial service in Paris.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Harriman is survived by her sisters, Sheila Moore of Atlanta and Ireland, and Jaquetta James of the Isle of Mull, Scotland; her brother, Edward, Lord Digby, of Minterne Magna; four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.         Harriman left his widow most of his fortune, more than $100 million, and designated her an executor and trustee of his estate and their charitable trusts. His daughters and their children were to share in the remains of a trust after Pamela Harriman's death. The financial arrangement set the stage for another family feud.         At about the time of their marriage, Harriman put his investments in the hands of William Rich, a man he believed to be a careful and conservative investor, and he engaged his old friend Clark Clifford and his partner Paul Warnke as his lawyers.         He told his wife to follow their advice, but Mr. Clifford soon became preoccupied with defending himself against charges growing out of allegations that he was involved in the huge B.C.C.I. bank and money-laundering scandal, and Mr. Warnke moved to another law firm. Mr. Rich proceeded to make what the Harriman heirs have charged were highly speculative and unwise investments that resulted in huge losses.         The heirs turned to her to make good on those losses. In 1994 they sued her in Federal court in Manhattan. Family members suggested she had pushed Mr. Rich into making risky investments to maintain her expensive habits. She denied it.         ''I never got involved in finances,'' she said. ''It is totally absurd to think that I had any influence, or tried to have any influence, on the running of the office or the management of the money. Never. There was no reason.''         Mrs. Harriman sold some property as well as a Picasso, a Matisse and a Renoir during that time. The two sides reached a settlement in 1995, agreeing not to divulge the terms, then joined forces to file a civil suit against Mr. Rich in Virginia.         Clinton's Her Candidate And Is Duly Grateful         In 1988 Mrs. Harriman's choice for President was Al Gore, not Michael Dukakis. For the 1992 election she considered a number of candidates before settling on Bill Clinton. She committed herself wholeheartedly to raising money for his campaign and he showed his gratitude by choosing her house for his first triumphal victory dinner in Washington. Later he named her Ambassador to France.         That was how Mrs. Harriman came to preside over the palatial residence of American ambassadors on the Rue du Faubourg-St.-Honore, not far on a Paris street map but a world away from the Avenue de New York and the apartment she occupied in the 1950's as Pamela Churchill.         That she was a woman with a past enhanced her standing with the French. Her energy went into 16-hour days dealing with questions of international trade, NATO expansion and the war in Bosnia, and working the telephone to Washinton late into the night, trying to forestall cuts in the Foreign Service budget. She loved every minute of it.         Remembering Mrs. Harriman yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called her a ''central figure in the history of this century.''         ''America has lost a remarkable representative, the State Department has lost one of its most effective diplomats and I have lost a friend,'' she said.         That Sunday morning in late 1996, as she sat in the living room of her private apartment in the Embassy residence, Mrs. Harriman was asked if there was anything she wished she had done differently.         ''No,'' she said.         ''Really, no regrets?''         ''I consider I have had a very fortunate life.''         ''A happy life?''         ''Very, very. I drank deep of the well.''       
         Margaret Halsey, author of the 1938 best seller ''With Malice Toward Some,'' which poked fun at English customs and mores, died on Tuesday at the Nathan Miller Nursing Home in White Plains. She was 86.         In her time, Ms. Halsey, a witty writer with an acute social concern, was compared to Dorothy Parker and H. L. Mencken. She came of age in an era when often the best job a well-educated graduate of a women's college could get was a secretarial position in publishing.         She was born in Yonkers, the daughter of Reinhold Halsey, deputy superintendent of buildings for New York City public schools. She attended Skidmore College.         In 1933, she became secretary to  the author and editor Max Eastman, who got her an entry-level job at Simon & Schuster in Manhattan.         In 1935, she married Henry Simon, an assistant professor of education at Teachers College at Columbia University and the brother of the publisher Richard L. Simon.         The newlyweds went to live in Devon, England, where Mr. Simon was on a teaching exchange. Ms. Halsey's letters home complaining of the eccentricities of English people, their food and the drudgery of their life, caught the attention of her brother-in-law, who commissioned her to write what became ''With Malice Toward Some.''         It included digressions on such subjects as English pie crust: ''It is possible to eat English pie crust, whatever you may think at first. The English eat it, and when they stand up and walk away, they are hardly bent over at all.'' On the subject of English shoes, Ms. Halsey wrote: ''Englishwomen's shoes look as if they had been made by someone who had often heard shoes described but had never seen any.'' The book sold 600,000 copies.         In 1944 Ms. Halsey was divorced from Mr. Simon. That year, she published ''Some of My Best Friends Are Soldiers,'' which she called ''a sort of novel'' about race relations in America. The book, an account of her work at the Stage Door Canteen in Times Square, was the beginning of a lifelong preoccupation with the subject of race.         ''Color Blind: A White Woman Looks at the Negro,'' followed in 1946. In the book, Ms. Halsey wrote that a need for a cheap labor supply and a fear of blacks' sexuality were at the heart of racism. Margaret Mead called the book ''straightforward, courageous and delightful.'' It was banned from schools in Georgia.         In ''The Pseudo-Ethic: A Speculation on American Politics and Morals'' in the late 60's, Ms. Halsey turned her attentions to a defense of Alger Hiss.         During the 1950's and 60's, her life took a darker course, and she wrote about her problems in ''No Laughing Matter: The Autobiography of a WASP'' (1977). She struggled with alcoholism and agoraphobia. Her only child, Deborah, nearly died from a brain tumor, and she was estranged from her parents. In 1969, her second marriage, to Milton R. Stern, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Deborah Halsey Stern, of White Plains.       
         Ella Maillart, a Swiss sportswoman, adventurer, travel writer and photographer who defied convention, hardship and international borders to explore forbidden territory and forbidding terrain, died on Thursday in her mountain chalet in Chandolin, Switzerland. She was 94.         She was the author of ''Forbidden Journey,'' an account of her 1935 trek to the closed city of Sinkiang in Chinese Turkestan.         During a life in which she was variously a French teacher in Wales, a secretary, a traveling saleswoman, an Olympic sailer, a competitive skier, a pioneer field hockey player, an actress, a sculptor's model and a movie stuntwoman, Ms. Maillart seemed most comfortable on the frontiers of social convention and  Western civilization.         The daughter of a well-to-do Geneva furrier and his athletic Danish  wife, Ms. Maillart grew up rich and restless.         An accomplished athlete who founded Switzerland's first women's field hockey club and was a member of the Swiss sailing team in the 1924 Olympics, Ms. Maillart was initially drawn to the sea.         She was a familiar figure on the Mediterranean in the 1920's and 30's and became something of a sensation in England after the commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet received an official reprimand because the entire fleet missed lights out while the Admiral entertained Ms. Maillart and three other yachtswomen.         She had to abandon a plan to sail the South Pacific with an all-female crew when her childhood sailing companion fell ill.         Instead, after a brief film career in Berlin in 1930, she went to Moscow, then walked across the Caucasus Mountains, tried to put together a women's field hockey team in Russia and rowed for a team called the Alimentation Workers' Eight.         A 1932 trip to Russian Turkestan whetted her appetite for Asian travel. An introduction to a Paris publisher by a noted yachtsman she had met on the Riviera helped her combine her wanderlust with professional purpose and led to two books, ''Turkestan Solo'' and ''Among Russian Youth: From Moscow to the Caucasus.''         In a 1993 interview with MarBy Blume in The International Herald Tribune, Ms. Maillart attributed her yearning for travel to her disgust with the horrors of World War I.         ''I wanted to leave Europe,'' she said, ''go as far as possible.''         Ms. Maillart, whose travel credo was ''Nobody can go? Then I shall go,'' was so determined to go where few Western men and virtually no women had gone before that she was willing to endure almost any hardship.         For her most famous journey, a harrowing 7-month, 3,500-mile trek from Beijing to Kashmir through  Chinese Turkestan in 1935, she set off with two pounds of marmalade, a  rifle, a bottle of Worcestershire  sauce, writing paper, a Leica camera and an unwieldy companion -- Peter Fleming, a Times of London correspondent and Ian Fleming's younger brother.         Both would have preferred to travel alone, but Ms. Maillart, knowing that foreigners were barred from the warlord-controlled territory, decided it might not be a bad idea to have a companion along in case she landed in prison.         Mr. Fleming, an acknowledged travel amateur, got the better part of the bargain: a companion who could design and make a tent, cook outdoors in freezing winds, sew and walk 14 miles without eating, and, as it happened, who was willing to wash his clothes as well as hers.         Or as he put it in his account of the journey, ''News Tartary,'' ''It was she, and not I, who did the dirty work.''         In the inevitable comparisons of their separate accounts of the journey, Mr. Fleming was considered the more elegant writer.         Ms. Maillart's book, a straightforward, workmanlike account of exactly what she saw, was written for the ages. In a thousand years, for example, her description of a child and newborn lambs on a yurt floor thick with their droppings will remain as authoritative an account of what things were like in Turkestan in 1935 as her photographs. Taken as notes, not as art, they were featured in a 1993 Paris exhibition.         Ms. Maillart, who often traveled alone -- on foot, on horseback, or by camel -- made another concession for a 1947 trek with a sick, morphine-addicted friend. She called the resulting book ''The Cruel Way: Two Women and a Ford in Afghanistan.''         Ms. Maillart, who leaves no immediate survivors, continued to travel, largely for her own amusement. But in recent years she cut back on her travels: She made her last trip to Tibet when she was 83 and had not traveled abroad since a visit to Goa three years ago.       
         Mary Dewart Gleason, whose family owned The New York Sun from 1926 until 1950, died of liver failure yesterday at the Maine Medical Center in Portland, her daughter, Laura Gleason Edgar, said. She was 81 and a longtime resident of Portland.         Mrs. Gleason's father, William T. Dewart, bought The Sun from the estate of Frank A. Munsey, and served as its president and publisher until his death in 1944.         In 1950 the family sold the newspaper to Scripps-Howard, which merged it to create The World-Telegram and Sun.         Born in New York City, Mrs. Gleason was the granddaughter of Thomas H. Wheeler, an early associate of John D. Rockefeller in the establishment of the Standard Oil Company.         A 1933 graduate of the Brearly School, Mrs. Gleason studied art in Italy after graduation. She was presented to New York society at a dinner-dance in December 1934.         Mrs. Gleason served on the board of the C. W. H. Merlis Corporation, a Dewart family holding company with interests in real estate and banking.         Mrs. Gleason is survived by her husband of 57 years, Frederick B. Gleason Jr.; a brother, Thomas W. Dewart of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, Frederick B. Gleason 3d of Savannah, Ga.; a daughter, Laura Gleason Edgar of Riverside, Conn.; three grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Una E. Johnson, who built the print collection of the Brooklyn Museum of Art into one of the country's largest and best, died April 28 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Johnson, who was born in Dayton, Iowa, in 1905, was educated at the University of Chicago where she studied art history and literature, and at what is now called Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.         She worked at the Cleveland Museum of Art before going to the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1936 as assistant curator of prints and drawings under Carl O. Schniewind. In 1941 he retired and she was appointed curator, a position she held until her own retirement in 1969. She was named curator emeritus by the museum in 1973. In 1947 she organized the museum's first annual National Print Exhibition, and she supervised them until 1968.         Ms. Johnson wrote numerous books and catalogues including ''Georges Rouault and His Prints,'' ''20th-Century Master Drawings,'' ''American Prints and Printmakers,'' ''Isabel Bishop, Prints and Drawings: 1925-1964,'' ''Adja Yunkers: 1927-1967,'' ''The American Woodcut: 1670-1950'' and, most important, a monograph about the  French art dealer Ambroise Vollard that catalogued his activities as a publisher of prints and illustrated books. The monograph, originally published by Wittenborn & Schultz in 1944, was republished by the Museum of Modern Art in 1977.         Ms. Johnson also served for three years as director of the Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, N.Y.       
         Dorothy Buffum Chandler, whose vision and fund-raising fervor helped transform modern Los Angeles and who as the wife and mother of successive publishers helped turn The Los Angeles Times into one of the nation's great newspapers, died on Sunday at a rest home in Hollywood. She was 96.         Mrs. Chandler's greatest single achievement was probably her nine-year drive in the late 1950's and early 60's to finance and build the Music Center of Los Angeles County, which revitalized the city's downtown district and fused old-line society with the newer wealth of Hollywood.         The opening of the center in 1964 earned her a spot on the cover of Time magazine and an accompanying article that declared her effort to get it built as ''the most impressive display of virtuoso money-raising and civic citizenship in the history of U.S. womanhood.''         The next year, the center's largest auditorium, which has become a frequent home to the Academy Awards ceremonies, was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.         Gov. Pete Wilson of California called Mrs. Chandler ''the heart and soul of Southern California's cultural life.'' Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles told The Los Angeles Times that ''her imprint will be part of Los Angeles for many centuries to come,'' particularly its cultural life.         Dorothy Buffum was born in Lafayette, Ill., and moved with her family to Long Beach, Calif., when she was a toddler. Her father and uncle opened a dry-goods store in Long Beach that eventually grew into the chain of Buffum's department stores, a fixture of Southern California until the 1980's.         She met Norman Chandler, the son of Harry Chandler, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, at a dance at Stanford University, and they married in 1922.         During the years that Norman Chandler trained to be publisher and worked his way through the newspaper's executive echelons, Mrs. Chandler raised their daughter, Camilla, and son, Otis, and did volunteer work for the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and other institutions.         When Harry Chandler died in 1944, Norman Chandler took over as publisher, and four years later his wife was named his administrative assistant. Her presence was quickly felt within the newspaper, particularly in the coverage of women and the arts. She was instrumental in inaugurating the paper's Women of the Year awards, which were given to more than 200 women between 1950 and 1976.         ''She was just really a ball of fire with whatever she set her mind to, whatever she wanted to get done,'' said James Bellows, a former editor of The New York Herald-Tribune and The Washington Star who was associate editor of The Los Angeles Times in the late 1960's and early 70's. ''She really worked at the role of women in the city, and was very involved in setting up the Women of the Year. She was very concerned that it reflect the diversity of the city and that it be given to women for their achievements and not just for social activities.''         Mr. Bellows said he found Mrs. Chandler to be ''tough, but not intractable,'' someone who knew her mind, was willing to debate and listen to argument and who eventually ''usually got her way.''         Mrs. Chandler's role as a civic fund-raiser began in earnest in 1950, when she undertook a successful drive to save the Hollywood Bowl. A few years later she began her effort to build the Music Center, eventually raising $19 million and forming a committee to float an additional $13.7 million in bonds that were guaranteed by the county.         ''She was a critical figure in the modernization of Los Angeles,'' said David Halberstam, whose book, ''The Powers That Be,'' chronicled the newspaper's rise under Mrs. Chandler's husband and son. ''If you're charting the coming of a big, sleepy, conservative community into the modern, affluent, increasingly sophisticated metropolis that exists today, she may be the single most important player.''         At the time, Mr. Halberstam said, Los Angeles was split between an older establishment centered in the downtown area and a newer establishment in Hollywood and farther to the west.         ''Culturally, she helped connect West Los Angeles with downtown Los Angeles, two communities that 40 years ago had almost nothing in common and barely spoke the same language,'' he said. ''It was her drive, energy, ambition and even hubris that connected them.''         Otis Chandler succeeded his father as the paper's publisher in 1960 and held that post for 20 years, though Norman Chandler remained an executive with the company until his death in 1974. Mrs. Chandler strongly supported her son's efforts to improve the quality of the newspaper and to raise it to the ranks of the nation's finest. Otis Chandler is now a board member of the Times Mirror Corporation, which owns the newspaper.         In later years, Mrs. Chandler served on numerous boards and Presidential commissions, devoting special attention to the University of California. She was among three women chosen by President Lyndon B. Johnson to visit South Vietnam in 1967 to assess the status of the American war effort. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan included her in the first group of winners of the National Medal of Arts.         She is survived by her son; her daughter, Camilla Chandler Frost, eight grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.         Anecdotes about Mrs. Chandler's fund-raising prowess are numerous.         One friend recalled how she tore up a $20,000 check from a wealthy businessman and handed it back to him, telling him that it was unacceptably paltry. At a private dinner where she was a guest, just weeks before the Music Center was to open, Mrs. Chandler is said to have stood up after coffee was served and gone from person to person collecting money in a large, blue bag.         ''I think of myself as a catalyst,'' she said in an interview shortly after the Music Center opened. ''There are so many people with good ideas and good intentions. They doubtless know more about the arts than I do. But I pull them together. That's my job.''       
         Ruth Adler, who kept the staff of The New York Times informed about its own milestones and behind-the-scenes adventures and shaped the legends and lore of The Times for other journalists and students for 33 years as editor of the newspaper's in-house journal Times Talk, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         Ms. Adler, who underwent open heart surgery in March, died of heart failure, her nephew, Peter Lewis, said.         Behind every news story there is an untold -- or rarely told -- tale of the reporter's personal experience: the hazards of covering a war or a riot, the grind of the campaign trail, a correspondent's travails with foul weather, bad food, crazy hours, unworkable communications and implausible expense accounts.         From 1947, when she became the first editor of Times Talk, to 1980, when she retired after 46 years with The Times, Ms. Adler chronicled these tales, and countless more routine doings, for the newspaper's 5,000 employees in a house organ that was one of the best and most widely read periodicals on the practice of journalism.         More than a compendium of staff marriages, births, deaths and achievements, it captured the life of the newspaper from the inside, with sometimes dramatic, often hilarious accounts from reporters around the world, from editors in a raucous city room, from printers riding Linotype machines, and hard men in square paper hats down in a thundering pressroom on 43d Street in Manhattan.         Reflecting its editor's fascination with the news and with the newspaper's daily production, her journal offered Tom Wicker's account of covering the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas; A. M. Rosenthal on his expulsion from Poland for reports that won a Pulitzer Prize; Claude Sitton on civil rights clashes in the South, and Robert Lipsyte on how to report a boxing match with a screaming fan standing on your typewriter. Such accounts were all the more intriguing in an era when most reporters were anonymous figures behind their news articles.         In 1966, Ms. Adler compiled 53 Times Talk articles in ''The Working Press: Special to The New York Times,'' published by G. P. Putnam's Sons. Eliot Fremont-Smith, in a review for The Times, said the book conveyed ''a remarkably clear picture of how The Times, as an entity, works -- how the news comes in and what happens to it, in both routine and crisis situations.''         Ms. Adler also wrote ''A Day in the Life of The New York Times'' (J. B. Lippincott, 1971), a 242-page account, hour by hour, of what the newspaper's staff did to put out the issue of Feb. 28, 1969, a date chosen arbitrarily, on which there was no earth-shaking news.         Based on memos from hundreds of Times employees, her account detailed the activities of reporters around the world and across the nation, looked over the shoulders of rewritemen pounding out inserts and of editors writing headlines and laying out pages, eavesdropped on advertising salesmen and then watched the presses roll and the delivery trucks roar away.         Ruth Adler was born in Rochester  on July 10, 1910, the daughter of Ida Lichtenstein and Mortimer Adler. She attended public schools in Rochester, graduated from Smith College and attended the Sorbonne in Paris for a year before joining The Times in 1934 as a secretary to Ivan Veit, then the promotion manager. She was not a member of the Adler family that is related to the Sulzbergers who own The Times.         Ms. Adler, who never married, played golf and tennis and was an extensive traveler.         She occasionally wrote articles for The Times's Sunday magazine or travel section. In 1947, she was asked to establish an internal news publication for the staff. Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher, was one of her principal fans and consultants; he gave her a small staff and complete autonomy to design, edit and produce Times Talk.         During her early tenure, Times Talk was 12 pages and appeared monthly. Later, the number of pages varied in a larger format, and it appeared 10 times a year. Its circulation went beyond The Times staff, to other journalists and to journalism schools, where many regarded it as a valuable teaching aid. Today, Times Talk has 28 pages, appears seven times a year and has a circulation of more than 8,500 current and retired employees of the newspaper.         When Ms. Adler retired in 1980, a full issue of Times Talk was devoted to her. The art critic John Canaday called her ''a living encyclopedia'' of the newspaper's recent history, and Russell Baker, the columnist, offered a tongue-in-cheek tribute to one of his favorite editors.         ''Some of the best people had worked for The Times for years before Times Talk revealed that they were actually first-rate reporters,'' he wrote. ''At a time when your material was usually reduced to chopped liver by The Times's famous editing process, the opportunity to tell the story right in Times Talk compensated for many a night when you stalked out of the office in a rage to tell it to the gin bottle.''       
         Kathy Keeton Guccione, who helped found Penthouse magazine in the United States with her husband, Bob Guccione, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. She was 58 years old and lived in New York.         The cause was complications from surgery to bypass an obstruction in her upper digestive tract, according to Jackie Markham, a spokeswoman for General Media, the magazine's publisher. Breast cancer was diagnosed in Ms. Keeton in 1995.         Ms. Keeton, who used her maiden name, was president and chief operating officer of General Media Communications Inc., which publishes several magazines and runs other media operations on the Internet. She was also vice chairman of General Media International, the holding company that oversees the publishing arm.         Raised on a farm in South Africa and trained as a ballet dancer in London, Ms. Keeton became at age 24 what The Associated Press called ''one of the highest-paid strippers in Europe.''         She met Mr. Guccione that year when he was starting Penthouse in London and she became one of the company's first employees, selling advertising. The two began living together two years later but did not marry until 1988.         In 1969, Ms. Keeton helped Mr. Guccione establish Penthouse in the United States and co-founded the science magazine Omni in 1979 and the health magazine Longevity in 1989, both of which are now published only on the Internet.         Ms. Keeton was the author of two books, ''Longevity: The Science of Staying Young,'' published in 1992,  and ''Woman of Tomorrow,'' published in 1985.         She spent the last two and a half years of her life fighting to get what she considered a fair trial for the cancer drug, hydrazine sulfate, which Ms. Keeton credited with extending her life, according to Ms. Markham. Ms. Keeton also established the Kathy Keeton Cancer Research Foundation to encourage research in alternative and complementary cancer therapies.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Keeton is survived by five stepchildren; her brother, Keith Keeton of South Africa; her uncle, William Keeton of South Africa, and three cousins, also of South Africa.       
         Ann Dunnigan, an actress and translator, died on Sept. 5 at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         Ms. Dunnigan was born in Hollywood and grew up in San Francisco. She attended Principia College in St. Louis. After a brief career in the theater, which included an appearance on Broadway in ''The Lord Blesses the Bishop'' in 1934, Ms. Dunnigan turned to teaching speech and then to translation. Her love for the writings of Chekhov led her to study Russian, after which she translated not only Chekhov but works by Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky. Her Chekhov translations included ''Selected Stories'' (1960), ''The Major Plays (1964) and ''Ward Six and Other Stories''(1965). Tennessee Willilams based his play ''The Notebook of Trigorin'' on Ms. Dunnigan's translation of Chekhov's ''Seagull.''         Ms. Dunnigan also translated Tolstoy's ''War and Peace'' (1968) as well as Ilya Tolstoy's reminiscence, ''Tolstoy, My Father'' (1971), and Dostoyevsky's ''Netochka Nezvanova'' (1970). She also served as an editor of translations for the Journal of Soviet Studies during the 1960's.         In 1978 Ms. Dunnigan threatened to sue the playwright Jean-Claude van Itallie over his version of Chekhov's ''Cherry Orchard,'' which she said had been taken ''word for word'' from her own translation of the play. In an out-of-court settlement, the theatrical publisher Samuel French halted printing, sale and distribution of the van Itallie text. Another publisher, Grove Press, also agreed to withdraw its copies of the van Itallie version.         Ms. Dunnigan returned to the theater one final time, in 1982, when she appeared in a New York Shakespeare Festival production of ''Antigone'' at the Public Theater. She is survived by a son, John Stearns of Manhattan, and a brother, Richard Dunnigan of Sacramento, Calif.       
         Catharine Carver, who won trans-Atlantic esteem as the editor of a galaxy of mid-20th century authors, including Hannah Arendt, John Berryman, Saul Bellow and Flannery O'Connor, died on Tuesday at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. Ms. Carver, an American who lived in London, was 76.         Friends said she died after a series of strokes.         Ms. Carver was widely known for her work at Lippincott with Leon Edel on many of the volumes of his biography of Henry James, a work she abridged at the author's request into a single volume. He acknowledged her success with thanks in his preface.         The last book to receive her professional attention, which was characterized by devotion to her authors, profound intelligence, sensitivity and scholarship and mastery of subject, as well as attention to detail and, above all, passion, was Richard Ellmann's biography ''Oscar Wilde,'' published by Knopf in 1987.         Aileen Ward, whose biography of John Keats won a National Book Award, said she was impressed that Ms. Carver had reread all of Keats's work before beginning to edit the manuscript. It was Ms. Carver who pointed out to Mr. Ellmann, who was baffled by James Joyce's use of the word trombone in a nonmusical sense while he was collecting an edition of the author's letters, that Joyce had simply appropriated a French colloquialism for paper clip.         Besides the praise she earned from individual authors, whose ranks also included E.E. Cummings, Lionel Trilling, Katherine Anne Porter, Bernard Malamud, Leslie Fiedler and Peter Matthiessen, Ms. Carver was given a citation some 20 years ago by New York P.E.N., the writers organization, for her ''creative contributions to authors and their works.''         Ms. Carver, who was born in Cambridge, Ohio, graduated in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Muskingum College in Ohio, where she was a classmate of the future astronaut and senator, John Glenn.         She began her editing career in 1945 with Reynal & Hitchcock, became the first reader at Partisan Review and was hired in 1950 by Robert Giroux as an editor at Harcourt, Brace and Company.         Subsequently she worked for Viking, Lippincott in Philadelphia and, briefly, for The New Yorker before leaving the United States in the 1960's to settle in England. There she worked at John Murray's and Chatto & Windus before joining Oxford University Press. But when that publisher shut down its offices in London, Ms. Carver declined to move to Oxford. Remaining in London, she worked with various publishers, including Victor Gollancz, and in the 1980's joined Trianon Press in Paris before returning to London.         She is not survived by any immediate family members.       
         Janet Annenberg Hooker, whose many philanthropies ranged from the support of musical organizations to the redecoration of The White House and the diplomatic rooms of the State Department in Washington, died Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 93 and had homes in Manhattan, Palm Beach, Fla., and Newport, R.I.         Mrs. Hooker was one of the principal benefactors of the National Museum of Natural History, the largest of the Smithsonian Institution's family of museum buildings on the Mall in Washington. She contributed $5 million for the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals, which opened this fall. The $10 million gallery has a walk-through mine, interactive exhibits and high-resolution videos of earthquakes and volcanic action.         A spectacular gem collection housed in the new building includes several other gifts from Mrs. Hooker, among them the Hooker Starburst Diamonds, which she donated  in 1994 in honor of her two sons, Gilbert S. Kahn and Donald P. Kahn. The dazzling set of rare yellow diamonds, cut in a starburst pattern, includes a 245-carat necklace with 50 rectangular diamonds, a 61-carat diamond ring and earrings. Each earring is a 25-carat yellow diamond surrounded by four pear-shaped and 16 baguette white diamonds.         In 1977, Mrs. Hooker also gave the Smithsonian a 75-carat emerald brooch. The half-million-dollar brooch, set with diamonds, was once owned by the Sultan of Turkey, who sported it on his belt buckle. Mrs. Hooker's son, Gilbert S. Kahn, said that his mother's total contribution to the Smithsonian, in cash and jewels, was about $9 million.         When the diplomatic reception rooms of the State Department building were rebuilt in the mid-1980's, Clement Conger, the curator at the time, described Mrs. Hooker as the project's ''staunchest supporter.'' The almost $8 million renovation, paid for with private funds, included the $3.5 million, 47-by-102-foot Benjamin Franklin Dining Room and the Secretary of State's $1.95 million, 10-room suite.         ''Mother was always interested in the decorative arts,'' Mr. Kahn said. He noted that during her winters in Palm Beach, she met and became friendly with a number of ambassadors who were guests at the annual Red Cross Ball, and this heightened  her interest in the effort to enhance the State Department building.         Mrs. Hooker also contributed $250,000 to renovate the Blue Room in the White House and contributed to the fund for the redecoration of the private quarters there. Her interest in the White House Preservation Fund extended through the administrations of six Presidents -- John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.         Mrs. Hooker, her brother, Walter Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James, and Mr. Annenberg's wife, Lenore, jointly contributed $200,000 in 1987 to the renovation of Blair-Lee House. The gift was for a garden room in a new wing of the government's guest house.         Mrs. Hooker was also an active presence on the social scene in both New York and Florida. One of her principal activities on the charity circuit was the fashionable April in Paris Ball in New York, a benefit affair for French and American organizations. For many years, she not only underwrote the cost of the decorations but also planned and assisted in their placement.         A number of musical institutions also were the recipients of Mrs. Hooker's beneficence. She donated a section of the lobby of the Metropolitan Opera House in Lincoln Center in honor of her mother, Mrs. Moses L. Annenberg, and she contributed over the years to the New York Philharmonic, the Musicians Emergency Fund and to various outdoor concert programs.         Although Mrs. Hooker bought a house in Newport, R.I., in 1992, her health began deteriorating and she never lived in it. ''You finish it and enjoy it,'' she told her son Gilbert. She and her son, however, gave a suite of Louis XV-style furniture to The Elms, one of Newport's famed ''cottages,'' built in 1901 and modeled after the Chateau d' Asineres near Paris. The suite consisted of 12 chairs, a small sofa and a fire screen, covered with 18th-century Beauvais tapestry and framed in gilt carved with trailing garlands and scallop shells. Janet Hooker's name is also on a plaque listing the major donors to the restoration of the house and gardens of the painter Claude Monet in Giverny, France.         Mrs. Hooker was born in Chicago on Oct. 13, 1904, one of seven daughters of Moses Annenberg, the founder of Triangle Publications, and Sadie Annenberg. Three of the publications -- T.V. Guide, The Daily Racing Form and Seventeen Magazine -- were sold to Rupert Murdoch for $3 billion in 1988.         According to a 1990 article in Forbes Magazine, Mrs. Hooker and two of her sisters, Esther Simon and Lita Hazen, both now deceased, were major beneficiaries of the sale. The magazine reported that two sisters, Enid Haupt and Evelyn Hall, had previously cashed in most of their stock. The other two sisters, Pearl (Polly) Levee and Harriette Ames, were deceased. The surviving sisters, and families of the deceased, were also reported to have shared in the proceeds of the sale of General Motors stock valued at $825 million.         Mrs. Hooker was educated at Kemper Hall, an Episcopal school in Kenosha, Wis. An outgoing woman with a determined will and a quiet sense of humor, she tapped into the family tradition of charity as a young bride. Her early grants were primarily in the field of music. Later, her major contributions reflected her interest in the decorative arts.         In 1924 she was married to L. Stanley Kahn, a publisher in the Annenberg communications empire. The couple divorced in 1937 and in the same year Mrs. Hooker, under the name of Janet Kahn, began a brief stage career. She appeared as a school trustee in ''Honor Bright,'' a play produced by Lee Shubert that was mounted in Detroit and Rhode Island but never came to New York. The following year, she married Joseph A. Neff of Lincoln, Neb., who had been in the clothing business in the West and later was involved in the sale of the Cleveland Plain Dealer to S.I. Newhouse. Mr. Neff died in 1969.         Her marriage to James Stewart Hooker took place in 1974. Mr. Hooker was head of labor relations for the Philadelphia Inquirer, an Annenberg newspaper at the time. Her son Gilbert said that the two met at business meetings and that the friendship evolved into a love match. Mr. Hooker died in 1976.         In addition to her two sons, Gilbert Kahn of Newport, R.I., and Miami, and Donald Kahn of Salzburg and London, she is survived by her two sisters, Enid Haupt of New York and Evelyn Hall of Palm Beach; her brother, Walter Annenberg of Philadelphia and Palm Springs, Calif.;  five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 17, 1997, Wednesday  A picture yesterday with an obituary of the philanthropist Janet Annenberg Hooker was published in error. It showed her sister Lita Annenberg Hazen, a patron of medical research and cultural institutions who died in 1995.         Correction:  December 19, 1997, Friday  An obituary of the philanthropist Janet Annenberg Hooker on Tuesday misstated the ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1974, when Ms. Hooker married James Stewart Hooker, an executive there. The paper was owned by the Knight chain, which merged that year to form Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc.; it was not an Annenberg paper at the time.       
         Denise Levertov, a poet of intense emotion and fervid political conviction, died on Saturday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle, where she lived. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lymphoma, said Griselda Ohannessian of New Directions, Ms. Levertov's publisher.         As a poet and political activist, Ms. Levertov was ''a touchstone, a maintainer for our generation,'' the poet Robert Creeley, one of her first publishers in the United States, said yesterday. ''She was a constantly defining presence in the world we shared, a remarkable and transforming poet for all of us. She always had a vivid emotional response and also a completely dedicated sense of political and social need.''         The poet Kenneth Rexroth once wrote that Ms. Levertov was ''the most subtly skillful poet of her generation, the most profound, the most modest, the most moving.''         In the tradition established by William Carlos Williams, she wrote with a concrete immediacy of language. She spoke directly through her poetry, favoring commonplace objects and images over large philosophical concepts.         The author of more than 30 books of poetry, essays and translations, she wrote with great particularity and sensitivity about aspects of love, spiritual as well as erotic. More and more, her work conveyed her political awareness and social consciousness. She was, as in the title of her first book of essays, ''The Poet in the World.'' At the same time, in her art she would contemplate her own life, writing confessional poems about her marital and familial problems. For her, content and form were ''in a dynamic state of interaction.''         In ''The Ache of Marriage,'' she wrote:         The ache of marriage:         thigh and tongue, beloved,         are heavy with it,         it throbs in the teeth         We look for communion         and are turned away, beloved,         each and each         It is leviathan and we         in its belly         looking for joy, some joy         not to be known outside it         two by two in the ark of         the ache of it.         And in ''Of Being,'' she wrote:         I know this happiness         is provisional:         the looming presences --         great suffering, great fear --         withdraw only         into peripheral vision:         but ineluctable this shimmering         of wind in the blue leaves:         this flood of stillness         widening the lake of sky:         this need to dance,         this need to kneel:         this mystery:         A defining moment of her life was the Vietnam War. She helped found a group called the Writers' and Artists' Protest Against the War in Vietnam, she was actively involved in the anti-nuclear movement, and in 1967 she edited a volume of poetry for the War Resisters League. In the same year, she published ''The Sorrow Dance,'' a book of poems whose sorrow included the war and also the death of the poet's sister.         Ms. Levertov was born in Ilford, England. Her father was Paul Philip Levertoff, a Russian Jew who converted to Christianity and became an Anglican priest. Her mother was from Wales. Her father's conversations about the family background in Hasidism and her mother's knowledge of Welsh and English folklore proved influential. Educated by her parents, she was introduced to poetry by her older sister, Olga, and was writing from an early age.         During World War II, she worked as a nurse in London and also began publishing her poetry. In 1940 her first poem appeared in Poetry Quarterly, and, said Mr. Rexroth, he and other poets were soon ''in excited correspondence about her'' as ''the baby of the new Romanticism.'' Her first volume of verse, ''The Double Image,'' was published in 1946.         After the war she married Mitchell Goodman, an American writer, and for several years they lived in France near Mr. Creeley, who was a friend of Mr. Goodman. In 1948 the couple moved to the United States, where Ms. Levertov studied and was influenced by such modernist poets as Williams, Wallace Stevens and Ezra Pound, and also continued her artistic relationship with Mr. Creeley, Robert Duncan and other Black Mountain poets.         Both she and her husband frequently spoke out on political issues, particularly regarding the Vietnam War. Mr. Goodman was convicted along with Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling resistance of the draft. Ms. Levertov and Mr. Goodman were divorced in 1975. Mr. Goodman died last February. They had one son, Nikolai, who lives in Seattle.         When Ms. Levertov's 11th collection of verse, ''The Freeing of the Dust,'' was published in 1975, the poet David Ignatow wrote in The New York Times Book Review that ''by nearly unanimous agreement Levertov was well on her way to becoming one of our leading poets'' with ''her forceful and compassionate presentations of urban lives'' and ''the beauty and sensuousness of her nature poems.'' By shifting to ''passionate Vietnam poems,'' she had lost some of her following but gained a new vitality.         Ms. Levertov wrote through six decades. In the 1990's, she published ''New and Selected Essays''; four poetry volumes, ''Evening Train,'' ''Sands of the Well,'' ''The Life Around Us: Selected Poems on Nature'' and ''The Stream and The Sapphire: Selected Poems on Religious Themes,'' and the prose memoir  ''Tesserae: Memories and Suppositions.''         She taught at colleges and universities, and served as poetry editor of The Nation and Mother Jones. Among her honors were the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in poetry and the $50,000 Lannan Prize. In 1996, she won the Governor's Award from the Washington State Commission for the Humanities.         She felt compelled to clarify and justify the uses of poetry in a world of political crisis. In ''New and Selected Essays'' she wrote, ''One is in despair over the current manifestation of malevolent imbecility and the seemingly invincible power of rapacity, yet finds oneself writing a poem about the trout lilies in the spring woods. And one has promised to speak at a meeting or help picket a building. If one is conscientious, the only solution is to attempt to weigh conflicting claims at each crucial moment, and in general to try to juggle well and keep all the oranges dancing in the air at once.''         Ms. Levertov was a masterly juggler of words, images and feelings, as well as a defender of artistic and political liberty.         In ''Overheard Over S.E. Asia,'' she wrote:         I am the snow that burns.         I fall         wherever men send me to fall --         but I prefer flesh, so smooth, so dense:         I decorate it in black, and seek the bone.
