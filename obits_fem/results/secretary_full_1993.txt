         Elizabeth Wood, a public housing pioneer who advocated racial and economic integration and the designing of workable neighborhoods, died yesterday at a nursing home near Atlanta. She was 93.         She suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a broken hip and a stroke, said Gisela Titman, a niece.         Miss Wood was the founding director of the Chicago Housing Authority, an Illinois state housing official and an officer of the National Association of Housing Officials. She was later a housing consultant in New York City and an administrator at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.         Known as "Chicago's largest landlord," she headed the authority from 1937 to 1954, supervising the building and management of homes for thousands of families. Sought Real Neighborhoods         The philosophy she developed over the years was to mix residents by race, economic class and family size. She proposed that social workers help troubled families who might drag down a project.         Miss Wood favored small, dispersed projects rather than high-rise concentrations. A building's height should be limited to the distance that a mother in a window could be heard when calling to a child in a playground below, she said.         She urged planners to include shops, churches, parks and even pubs to turn housing complexes into real neighborhoods instead of human warehouses. Courtyards and indoor gathering places should have an inviting "design for loitering," she said. She sponsored flower-growing contests to brighten the projects.         Political pressure eventually forced Miss Wood out of her Chicago job. She said she fought with officials "and anybody else who stood in the way of getting homes built for the people."         She then went to New York, where she did studies for the City Housing Authority and the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. From 1965 to 1972 she worked at H.U.D. in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations to coordinate housing policy with other social and poverty programs.         She won Guggenheim and Ford Foundation grants to study in Iran and analyze housing in India. She wrote numerous articles and books.         The daughter of a missionary teacher, Miss Wood was born in Nara, Japan, and grew up in Bloomington, Ill. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in rhetoric at the University of Michigan, she taught English for four years at Vassar College.         After moving to Chicago for doctoral studies, she instead became a social worker for United Charities. She then joined the Home Modernization Bureau, where a major contractor tutored her on the construction industry.         When the New Deal Public Works Administration began building housing, she became a planner. She also served as executive secretary of the Illinois Housing Board when it drafted a law creating housing authorities.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Judith Grad, a former counsel to the New York City Board of Ethics who in later life became a psychotherapist, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 68.         The cause of death was heart failure, her family said.         A native of Brooklyn and graduate of Brooklyn College, she put herself through New York University Law School at night by working as a legal secretary. She was an editor of the N.Y.U. Law Review and graduated first in her class. Joined Law Department         During the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay, Miss Grad worked in the city's Law Department, rising to chief of the Opinions and Legislation Division. There, she helped draft the 1974 state law that repealed the requirement for corroboration of testimony in the prosecution of sex offenders.         In 1978, Mayor Edward I. Koch recruited Miss Grad for the Board of Ethics. As counsel, she was involved in the investigation of city officials and employees for financial interests or private interests that were in conflict with the proper discharge of official duties. One case arising during her tenure involved charges of corruption against Donald R. Manes, the Queens Borough President who committed suicide in 1986. She retired after about 10 years in office.         Prior to her ethics work, Miss Grad did pro bono work for Odyssey House, the drug and alcohol treatment organization in New York, and ran group counseling sessions for women there. This stirred her interest in psychotherapy, which she pursued after leaving public service. She trained with the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis and, at the time of her death, was treating patients as a psychotherapist.         She became a board member of the Metropolitan Center for Mental Health, a psychiatric clinic on the Upper West Side that helps people unable to afford private treatment. She was board president of the Metropolitan Institute for Training in Psychoanalytic Psychotherapy, which is associated with the center.         Miss Grad is survived by her sister, Charlotte Schiff-Jones of Manhattan.       
         Marian Anderson, whose velvety contralto and dignified, affecting stage manner melted the hearts of music lovers around the world, and whose determination helped shatter racial barriers in the arts, died yesterday in Portland, Ore. She was 96.         She died at the home of her nephew, the conductor James DePreist. Lee Walter, a friend of the singer, gave the cause as congestive heart failure a month after a stroke.         Miss Anderson's achievements, which inspired generations of young black performers, included a concert before 75,000 listeners at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939 arranged by Eleanor Roosevelt after the Daughters of the American Revolution denied the singer the use of the concert hall in their national headquarters. And when she made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1955, she became the first black singer to perform there.         The soprano Leontyne Price, one of the first artists to benefit from Miss Anderson's efforts, said yesterday, "Her example of professionalism, uncompromising standards, overcoming obstacles, persistence, resiliency and undaunted spirit inspired me to believe that I could achieve goals that otherwise would have been unthought of."         In 1989, when a group of musicians that included Isaac Stern, Jessye Norman and Julius Rudel put together a concert to raise money for the Marian Anderson Award, a prize given to young singers as an honor to its namesake, Donal Henahan wrote in The New York Times, "Miss Anderson's place as a high priestess of American musicians, whatever their color, is not to be denied." Bigotry on a Daily Level         But Miss Anderson had to fight hard to win her place in American music history. Although she won first prize in a voice contest in New York in 1925 and made an appearance that year with the New York Philharmonic at Lewisohn Stadium, she was unable to find operatic engagements, and within a few years her career came to a standstill. It was only after she toured Europe to great acclaim in the early 1930's that the American public began to pay attention to her.         Even after her artistry was recognized in her homeland, she faced racial prejudice on a more mundane level. Well into her career, she was turned away at restaurants and hotels. Even America's opera houses remained closed to her until Rudolf Bing invited her to sing at the Met near the end of her career.         Because opera was denied her for most of her career, Miss Anderson's reputation rests on the considerable communicative power that she brought to the recital stage. Her manner -- closed eyes, very few gestures -- conveyed stateliness and inner serenity. And her repertory covered considerable ground, from Bach and Handel oratorio selections to Schubert, Brahms, Schumann and Rachmaninoff songs, Verdi arias and spirituals.         Her recordings of standard concert works, most notably Schubert's "Ave Maria," were prized for the radiant beauty of her interpretations. But one of her real achievements was in emphasizing that spirituals deserved a place in the active repertory, something she demonstrated with sublime readings of "My Lord, What a Morning" and "Crucifixion," which were the centerpieces of many programs.  Sang at Age 3         "They are my own music," she once said. "But it is not for that reason that I love to sing them. I love them because they are truly spiritual in quality; they give forth the aura of faith, simplicity, humility and hope."         During her career, Miss Anderson gave her date of birth as Feb. 17, 1902, but June Goodman, a longtime friend of hers, said that while going through some family papers recently, she found Miss Anderson's birth certificate, which gave the date as Feb. 27, 1897. Miss Anderson was born in Philadelphia, the oldest of three children. Her father died when she was a child, and her mother took in laundry to support the family. She began singing when she was 3 years old; when she was 6 she joined the choir at the Union Baptist Church and impressed the director by learning all the parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass -- in the hymns the choir sang.         She did not have her first formal lessons until she was 15 and began studying with Mary S. Patterson. Her church choir raised money to pay for her lessons, and the Philadelphia Choral Society, a black ensemble, gave a benefit performance to support further studies with Agnes Reifsnyder and Giuseppe Boghetti.         In 1925, Mr. Boghetti entered his pupil in a New York Philharmonic voice competition, in which she competed with 300 singers and won first prize. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic on Aug. 27, 1925, and was immediately signed by a concert manager. But after a Town Hall recital and a handful of concerts, her engagements dwindled. By 1930, she decided to go to Europe, not only in search of performance opportunities, but in the hope of perfecting her command of languages and devoting further study to the art of lieder singing.         Her performances in Europe were great successes. During a Scandinavian tour in 1930 she met the composer Jean Sibelius, who spoke glowingly of her voice and dedicated the song "Solitude" to her. And when she ended a 1935 tour in Salzburg, Arturo Toscanini told her, "A voice like yours is heard once in a hundred years."  Persuaded to Return         The impresario Sol Hurok heard Miss Anderson sing in Paris that same year, and offered to present her in another Town Hall recital. She had misgivings, having received so much more enthusiastic a reception in Europe than in the United States. But Mr. Hurok persuaded her, and he remained her manager for the rest of her career.         Miss Anderson's return to Town Hall on Dec. 30, 1935, was the success that Hurok told her it would be. "Let it be said from the outset," Howard Taubman wrote in The Times, "Marian Anderson has returned to her native land one of the great singers of our time."         In the late 1930's, she gave about 70 recitals a year in the United States. But her fame did not entirely eradicate the prejudice she confronted as a young black singer touring the United States. It was a particularly unfortunate display of that prejudice, however, that helped make Miss Anderson a household name. In 1939, Hurok tried to book her at Constitution Hall in the national headquarters of the D.A.R., and was told that all dates were taken.         When Hurok took his singer's case to the public, Eleanor Roosevelt, the First Lady, resigned from the D.A.R., and other prominent women followed suit. Harold L. Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior, offered Miss Anderson the Lincoln Memorial for a concert on Easter Sunday 1939. Some 75,000 people attended the concert, and millions more listened to the radio broadcast. Photographs and films of Miss Anderson singing in front of Lincoln's statue, before the enormous crowd, quickly became a poignant symbol for the nascent civil rights movement.  Noncombative Personality         During the dispute, Miss Anderson maintained the quiet dignity for which she was famous. Refusing to comment or to express any rancor when reporters pressed her for a response, she later wrote in "My Lord, What a Morning," her memoir, "I particularly did not want to say anything about the D.A.R. As I have made clear, I did not feel that I was designed for hand-to-hand combat."         Four years later, the D.A.R. invited Miss Anderson to take part in a China Relief concert at Constitution Hall. "When I finally walked onto the stage of Constitution Hall," she said later, "I felt no different than I had in other halls. There was no sense of triumph. I felt that it was a beautiful concert hall and I was very happy to sing there."         Miss Anderson continued to tour as a recitalist, but made no headway in the opera world until Mr. Bing invited her to sing Ulrica in Verdi's "Ballo in Maschera." She made her debut on Jan. 7, 1955.         "The curtain rose on the second scene," Miss Anderson said later about the evening, "and I was there on stage, mixing the witch's brew. I trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded before I could sing a note, I felt myself tightening into a knot."         It did not matter that at 57 she was past her vocal prime. As Howard Taubman noted in his review in The Times, "men as well as women were dabbing at their eyes" during the tumultuous ovation. Toured for State Department         In 1957, the State Department sponsored a 10-week tour of India and the Far East in which Miss Anderson sang 24 concerts in 14 countries. A CBS News crew accompanied her, and the film was used in "The Lady From Philadelphia," a program in Edward R. Murrow's "See It Now" series.         She sang at President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration in 1957, and at President John F. Kennedy's in 1961, and later that year for American troops in Berlin. She toured Australia for the first time in 1962, and in October 1964 began her farewell tour, at Constitution Hall, and gave her last recital at Carnegie Hall on April 18, 1965. She made occasional stage appearances in the 1970's, as the reader in Aaron Copland's "Lincoln Portrait."         Late in her life Miss Anderson was frequently honored. She was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, and in 1978 was in the first group of artists to receive Kennedy Center Honors. In 1980, the United States Treasury Department coined a half-ounce gold commemorative medal with her likeness, and in 1984 she was the first recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award of the City of New York. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Arts Medal.         Miss Anderson married Orpheus H. Fisher, an architect, in 1943; he died in 1986. They had no children. The singer spent her retirement at her farm, which she named Marianna, in Danbury, Conn., and although in her last years she had to use a wheelchair, she was occasionally seen at concerts in New York City. In July 1992 she moved to Portland to live with her nephew, Mr. DePreist, who is her only survivor.         In the late 1950's, when Miss Anderson began to wind down her singing career, she pursued several other interests. President Eisenhower appointed her an alternative representative in the United States delegation to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations. She gave benefit concerts for the Congress of Racial Equality, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. And she sang again at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.         She also made a point of helping young singers, particularly through the Marian Anderson Awards, which she started when the city of Philadelphia awarded her the $10,000 Bok Prize in 1943. Eventually the prize fund ran out of money, but since its re-establishment in 1990 it dispenses $25,000 annually. She was also associated with Young Audiences, an organization that presents school concerts with professional musicians.         In addition to direct involvement and encouragement, she was also, of course, a role model for the black musicians who followed her.         "At age 10 I heard, for the first time, the singing of Marian Anderson on a recording," the soprano Jessye Norman once said. "I listened, thinking, 'This can't be just a voice, so rich and beautiful.' It was a revelation. And I wept."       
         Raphaelle Jeanne Semmes, a senior civil servant who became executive director of the Bush Administration's Commission on Environmental Quality, died Tuesday at the Washington Home Hospice. She was 46 and lived in Washington.         The cause was cancer, said her sister Walden S. Morton.         Miss Semmes went into Government service in 1970 as a supervisor in the Department of Transportation. She served as executive secretary of the Peace Corps from 1982 to 1989.         In the fall of 1991 she was named executive director of the new panel set up to advise President George Bush on ways to protect the environment without excessive cost.         Miss Semmes was born in New Orleans. She graduated from George Washington University and received a master's degree from the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University.         Her marriage to Robert Taylor of Washington ended in divorce.         Besides her sister, Walden, of Center Harbor, N.H., she is survived by a son, Raphael James Taylor; her parents, Vice Adm. Benedict J. Semmes, retired, and Katherine Ainsworth Semmes of Washington; another sister, Amy Semmes Waite of Cambridge, Mass., and a brother, Dr. B. J. Semmes of Chevy Chase, Md.       
         Beatrice Bishop Berle, a physician, teacher and author, died on Friday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass.  She was 90 years old.         Her death was caused by complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Beatrice Berle Meyerson.         Dr. Berle, who ran a neighbhorhood health clinic in East Harlem from 1953 until 1962, took a pioneering approach to family medicine by treating the entire family for the effects of heroin abuse by a member. She also helped to establish methadone maintenance as a significant treatment for heroin abuse.         Dr. Berle, who was born on Aug. 6, 1902, in Lenox, Mass, graduated from Vassar College in 1923. She received a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1924 and a medical degree from New York University in 1938.         In 1927 she married Adolf A. Berle Jr., an economist and lawyer who served during the Roosevelt Administration as Assistant Secretary of State. Dr. Berle worked in the United States Public Health Service in Washington from 1943 until 1944. Worked in Brazil         Traveling to Brazil with her husband, who was Ambassador to Brazil from 1945 until 1946, Dr. Berle volunteered in hospital wards in Rio de Janeiro, where she organized efforts to expand the practice of preventive medicine. She also wrote articles and edited a book on medical problems in Brazil.         Her other books were "Eighty Puerto Rican Families in New York City," a study of the families in her East Harlem clinic, published by Columbia University Press in 1958, and "A Life in Two Worlds," an autobiography published in in 1983 by Walker & Company.         During her career, Dr. Berle was associated with St. Luke's Hospital Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at the Bronx State Hospital, Cornell University Medical College, New York University Medical College and Yeshiva University.         After the death of her first husband in 1971, Dr. Berle in 1975 married Dr. Andre F. Cournand, a physican who was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1956. Dr. Cournand died in 1988.         In addition to Ms. Meyerson, of Washington, Dr. Berle is survived by another daughter, Alice Berle Crawford of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, Peter A. A. Berle of Manhattan; 10 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Anne M. Johnson, a former vice president of Beginner Books, a children's book division of Random House, died on Sunday at her home in Clifton, N.J. She was 62.         She had a brief illness, said Robert L. Bernstein, with whom she had worked at Random House.         Mrs. Johnson, a native of Staten Island, graduated from Hunter College and briefly worked for Doubleday & Company before joining Random House in 1956 as a secretary. The following year she began to work with Mr. Bernstein. From 1966 she was the assistant to the chairman and president while Mr. Bernstein held those positions at Random House.         At Beginner Books, she worked closely with Theodor S. Geisel, the star author for that imprint known as Dr. Seuss. She was a board member of the Dr. Seuss Foundation.         Mrs. Johnson was the widow of Hugh Johnson, executive vice president of Hammond Publishing, who died in 1987.       
         Dr. Alva C. Cooper, a pioneer in college career counseling and placement and an advocate for minorities and women, died on Friday in New Millford, N.J. She was 83.         Her nephew, John H. Taylor Jr., said she had a long illness.         Dr. Cooper was born in New York City and was a resident of Bayville, L.I.         While she was a professor at Hunter College in New York, she established one of the nation's first on-campus college placement offices. She also helped to found several professional organizations serving the personnel recruitment industry.         She was one of the founders of the Council on Career Development for Minorities and traveled extensively, establishing career offices at colleges and universities with mostly black enrollments and seeking job opportunites for minorities in corporate America.         In 1965, Dr. Cooper was appointed to a task force on the role of women in the military by Secretary of Defense Robert S. MacNamara. She was a member of a task force of 20 women who worked closely with President Lyndon B. Johnson and the Joint Chiefs of Staff in setting a policy for the recruitment of women into the American military and defining their roles.         Dr. Cooper retired from Hunter College as Professor Emeritus in 1976. Her husband, James Cooper, died in 1982.         Survivors include a sister, Rosemarie C. Taylor of River Edge, N.J.; two nieces, Valerie E. Herbstman of East Quogue, L.I., and Jeanne Alva Besley of Bayville, and a nephew, John H. Taylor Jr. of Lattington, L.I.       
         Pat Nixon, the quiet consort who stood by her husband, Richard M. Nixon, in the White House and out, through victory, defeat, sorrow and illness, died yesterday at their home in Park Ridge, N.J. She was 81.         Mrs. Nixon, who had been ill for several years, died of lung cancer, said Kim Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Nixon family.         She said former President Nixon and the Nixons' two daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, were with Mrs. Nixon when she died at 5:45 A.M. She also said that Mr. Nixon, who visited Russia in February and China in April, was "in excellent health as evidenced by his recent travel schedule."         Commenting on Mrs. Nixon's death, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said, "Pat Nixon was an extraordinarily supportive First Lady, particularly good in her judgment of people."         Former President Ronald Reagan issued a statement that Mrs. Nixon was "a pillar of great strength during a time of turmoil." Dislike of Politics         On the eve of Richard Nixon's inauguration as President in 1969, Pat Nixon was asked if she had ever encouraged her husband to enter politics.         "No," she replied. "I did not. Politics was not what I would have chosen for him because, after all, you don't see as much of your husband as you would like and it's a hard life."         But, she went on, Mr. Nixon was convinced that politics was his duty.         "What could I do?" she said.         What Mrs. Nixon did was subjugate her instinct for privacy and homemaking and become her husband's faithful companion in his turbulent years in the political arena, from the happy early years after his election as United States Representative from California in 1946 until his humiliating resignation as President of the United States in August 1974, under the shadow of impeachment proceedings that grew out of the Watergate scandals.         In Mr. Nixon's years as Representative, Senator, Vice President, candidate for governor of California, Presidential candidate and President, his wife was a fixture at his side, always seeming to listen raptly to his speeches and maintaining a gracious, if thin, smile.         In 1968, the writer Gloria Steinem interviewed Mrs. Nixon aboard an airplane while she was accompanying her husband on the Presidential campaign.  In the New York magazine article, Ms. Steinem quoted Mrs. Nixon as saying: "Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I've stayed interested in people, I've kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank-you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I've never had it easy. I'm not like all you . . . all those people who had it easy." Image as President's Wife         Although her years before the public exceeded those of her two predecessors at the White House, Mrs. Nixon did not seem to stamp her personality on the nation's consciousness. Instead, her image was of a private, dutiful wife seemingly self-contained and impenetrable.         Her composure rarely wavered in her appearances with her husband in such trying circumstances as his televised Checkers speech in 1952, when he denied unethical use of an $18,000 political fund ("Pat doesn't have a mink coat"), the ordeal in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1958, when a stone-throwing, spitting, anti-American mob besieged the Nixon limousine; and the Nixons' grim, hand-in-hand walk down a red carpet from the White House after his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.         Despite the early traumas and Mrs. Nixon's wish that her husband retire from politics, she was enthusiastic enough on the eve of his nomination as the Republican Presidential candidate in 1968 to say, "This really is the American dream, where people from humble circumstances can, through sheer hard work, go up the ladder." Humble Origins in West         Her own origins had, indeed, been humble. She was born Thelma Catherine Ryan on March 16, 1912, in the small mining town of Ely, Nev. Her father, William, an itinerant miner of Irish-American ancestry, gave her the nickname Pat because of her birth on the eve of St. Patrick's Day.         Before she was a year old, her mother, Kate, a German-born woman with a son and daughter from a previous marriage, prevailed on her husband to leave the mines. The family moved to Artesia, Calif., about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and started a truck farm on a four-acre plot that had little plumbing and no electricity.         "We all worked hard," Mrs. Nixon recalled years later. "We dug potatoes, we picked tomatoes, we picked peppers, cauliflowers and peanuts."         In 1924, when Pat was 12, her mother died of cancer.         "For the last two or three months I used to sit with her through the night," she said years later. "We couldn't afford a night nurse and she needed attention."         Five years after her mother's death, Pat's jolly, blue-eyed father, whom she adored, died of the miner's disease, silicosis. Cross-Country Trip         The five children in the family soon split up. Pat, at the age of 18, at the height of the Depression, set out for New York, driving an elderly couple across the country in their Packard.         For two years, until 1932, she worked in New York as a secretary and X-ray technician. The money she saved eventually got her back to California and into the University of Southern California, where her major was merchandising. Walk-on parts on Hollywood movie sets helped finance her education.         She graduated cum laude in 1937 and tried unsuccessfully to find work as a buyer for a department store. So she took a job at $190 a month teaching shorthand and typing at a secondary school in Whittier, Calif.         She was also interested in amateur theater, and at auditions for the play "The Dark Tower" one night in 1938, she met Richard M. Nixon, a recent graduate of Duke Law School who had set up practice in Whittier.         Both won parts in the play that night, and the young Nixon proposed to her a few hours later.         "I thought he was crazy," she said in 1969.         Mr. Nixon courted her for two years, sometimes even driving her to meet other beaus, before she accepted the proposal. Married in Riverside         They were married June 21, 1940, in a Quaker ceremony in Riverside, Calif. The bride was 28 years old, and Mr. Nixon was 10 months younger.         After finishing his naval service in 1945, Mr. Nixon decided to run for the House of Representatives. Just before the campaign started, the Nixons' older daughter, Patricia (Tricia), was born, on Feb. 21, 1946. In Representative Nixon's first term, another daughter, Julie, was born, on July 5, 1948.         Two years later, Mr. Nixon began a successful campaign for the Senate. While he generated controversy with his anti-Communist campaign speeches, his wife was portrayed in the press as projecting what would later be called a "20th-century born-in-a-log-cabin image."         She also began projecting the image of game and gracious campaigner, always able to suppress distress and bitterness.         As the President's wife, Mrs. Nixon traveled more than 100,000 miles, campaigning for her husband, accompanying him to foreign countries and, on several occasions, representing him at ceremonies abroad. Foreign Affairs Duties         She was the first wife of a President designated to head a United Nations delegation abroad, to the inauguration of President William R. Tolbert Jr. of Liberia in 1972. She also visited Peru in 1970 to see areas devastated by an earthquake, and in early 1974 she headed the United States delegation to inaugural ceremonies for the Presidents of Brazil and Venezuela.         Mrs. Nixon promoted various education programs and sought to enlist Americans in volunteer aid programs.         She shied away from adopting any publicity-inspiring projects like Jacqueline Kennedy's historical redecoration of the White House. Instead, she seemed to enjoy a more traditional and limited role in the White House, as Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower had.         Nixon White House receptions and dinners were frequent, but small and sedate, with none of the exuberance of the Kennedy and Johnson Presidencies. Only in receiving-line chitchat and in quiet little teas and receptions at the mansion did the real warmth and thoughtfulness of Mrs. Nixon's personality emerge. Seclusion at San Clemente         After her husband's resignation, Mrs. Nixon remained in seclusion for nine months with him at their estate in San Clemente, Calif., and moved to New York in 1980.         In the summer of 1976, Mrs. Nixon suffered a stroke that partly paralyzed her left arm and leg and the left side of her face for about a year. She had another stroke in the early 1980's and fully recovered from it, too. But in recent years she was very frail and suffered from emphysema, and she was hospitalized several times for lung problems, said Kathy O'Connor, Mr. Nixon's chief of staff.         Besides her husband and her daughters, Ms. Cox of Manhattan, whose husband, Edward F. Cox, is a lawyer, and Ms. Eisenhower of Berwyn, Pa., whose husband, David Eisenhower, is a military historian and grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mrs. Nixon's survivors include two grandsons, Christopher Nixon Cox and Alex Richard Eisenhower, and two granddaughters, Melanie and Jennie Eisenhower.         A service for Mrs. Nixon with family members and friends attending will be held at 10 A.M. Saturday in the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., with the Rev. Dr. Billy Graham presiding and eulogies by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and others. A private burial service will follow on the grounds of the library.         Mrs. Nixon's body will lie in state at the library on Friday. The public will be admitted from 5 P.M. to 9 P.M.       
         Frances Ruth Grant, who spent her life opposing dictatorships and promoting human rights in the Americas, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 96.         Miss Grant's dedication to Latin American culture, art and human rights began in her childhood. The daughter of a pioneer of New Mexico's statehood, she was born and raised in the remote pueblo of Abiquiu in the foothills of the Valle Grande mountains. It was there that she absorbed the atmosphere of Hispanic-American culture.         She was educated at Barnard College and graduated from Columbia University's School of Journalism in 1918. She also received extensive tutoring in economics, political science, music and the arts. A Museum Founder         She was a founder in 1923 of the Nicholas Roerich Museum in Manhattan, under whose auspices she went to the Far East and wrote about the philosophies and cultures of India and Tibet. She served as a vice president of the museum until 1937.         Miss Grant first visited Latin America in 1929 and after that devoted most of her energy to the republics of the hemisphere. She lectured at virtually all of its universities and centers of learning and started some of the first cultural interchanges, including exhibitions, musical programs and public forums.         Her work was primarily responsible for the Roerich Pact, an inter-American agreement for the preservation of cultural sites signed at the White House by 21 republics in 1935. She founded the Pan American Women's Association in 1930 and the Inter-American Association for Democracy and Freedom in 1950 and headed both of them into her late 80's. A Journal Editor         From 1951 until the mid-1980's, she edited the English and Spanish editions of Hemispherica, a journal published by the Inter-American Association. For this she received a special citation in 1982 at Columbia University from the trustees of the annual Maria Moors Cabot prizes in inter-American journalism.         Recognized as a leader in the defense of civil and politcal liberties, she was a past chairman of the Latin American section and secretary of the International League for Human Rights. The league is a nongovernmental agency accredited by the United Nations whose predecessors date back to the Dreyfus affair in France nearly a century ago.         Jose Figueres Ferrer, then the President of Costa Rica and himself a resolute champion of democracy, paid tribute to Miss Grant in a public address in New York in 1951. He called her "the greatest fighter for democracy and human rights in the hemisphere."       
         Caroline Klein Simon, who overcame early obstacles to women in the legal profession to become a pioneering female judge, politician, state official and champion of laws against discrimination in jobs and housing, died yesterday at home. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Judge Simon, who was still active as a lawyer at her death, served in state posts under appointments from both Republican and Democratic governors and was the first woman nominated by a major party for citywide office in New York City.         She helped draft the nation's first state law barring job discrimination and later led the nation in imposing regulations against racial "block busting" by real-estate brokers.         Judge Simon's credo was simple. "I am against discrimination in any form," she said.         During her own career, she faced discrimination from the very beginning.         She was rejected for admission to Columbia University's law school in the 1920's because it did not have toilets and other accommodations for female students, her family said. So she earned her law degree at New York University instead. Failed Search for Paying Job         After graduation, despite her strong academic record and passing the bar examination, she was turned down by every firm where she applied to become a law clerk. She finally offered to work free for a year "to convince them that a woman could be a lawyer," she later recalled.         Greenbaum, Wolff & Ernst took her up and after the year was up she was offered a permanent job. But she decided instead to work for indigent clients and family planning groups.         Three decades later, she was a leading candidate to become the Postmaster of New York in 1958 but was vetoed by Federal officials. The New York Times reported, based on officials close to the Postmaster General, "Opposition to the appointment of Mrs. Caroline K. Simon was based on the ground that the job was unsuited to a woman."         In a widely quoted speech the next year, she said: "There are four things a woman needs to know. She needs to know how to look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man and work like a dog." Worked Under Dewey         Her public service began in the 1930's when she was instrumental in changing state laws to entitle women to serve as jurors and was herself among the first called for service.         District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey of Manhattan named her to a panel on revising the Domestic Relations Court Act. During World War II she served as the Office of Civilian Defense's director of group activities in New York, New Jersey and Delaware.         Mr. Dewey, by then Governor, appointed her to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board in 1944-45 and the temporary State War Council's Committee on Discrimination in Employment in 1943-45.         Eager to continue the fight against discrimination, she helped draft the nation's first state law on job bias based on race, religion or nationality and became a founding member of the resulting State Commission Against Discrimination. City Council Race         In 1956, Gov. W. Averell Harriman, a Democrat, appointed her to the new State Youth Commission.         The next year she ran for City Council President as a Republican. Although she lost to Abe Stark by about two-to-one, she still ran some 100,000 votes ahead of her ticket and received the biggest total for a citywide Republican candidate.         In 1958 she served as the legal advisor to the American delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.         In 1959 Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, inducted her as New York's Secretary of State, the second woman to hold that post. It was in that role that she issued the nation's first regulations against block busting, in which brokers manipulated property owners' fears about racial or ethnic changes in the neighborhood to provoke sales.         It was her marriage to Leopold K. Simon, a lawyer, that ignited her interest in the law.         They divorced in the early 1950's. She remarried, to Irving W. Halpern, the chief probation officer of the Court of General Sessions, who died in 1966.         Her survivors include her son, Lee K., of Wilmington, N.C.; a daughter, Cathy Prince of White Plains; a brother, Nathan F. Klein of Titusville, Fla.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         A service will be held at 11 A.M. Sunday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street in Manhattan.       
         Sophia Yarnall Jacobs, a lifelong advocate of civil and human rights, died on Wednesday at her home on Mount Desert Island in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 91.         Her daughter, Charlton Yarnall Phelps, said the cause was congestive heart failure.         Mrs. Jacobs was former president of the Urban League of Greater New York and the National Council of Women. She was active in the Urban League movement for more than 20 years and served as vice president and trustee of the National Urban League.         As head of the league's chapter for Greater New York from 1955 to 1960, she fought school segregation, pressed for more public housing on vacant land sites and led action for legislation barring racial discrimination in private housing.  Headed Women's Council         In 1959, Mrs. Jacobs took part in the first "woman-to-woman" exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. She became president of the National Council of Women in 1960 and was chairwoman of the 75th anniversary of the International Council of Women and the national affiliate, in Washington in 1963.         Born in Haverford, Pa., she attended Bryn Mawr College for two years. In 1921, she married Reginald Robert Jacobs, a Philadelphia banker. The marriage ended in divorce in 1937.         While in Philadelphia, she wrote many articles of interest to women, published in Good Housekeeping, Country Life, Harper's Bazaar, Parents, Reader's Digest and other magazines. From 1937 to 1945, she served as executive secretary of the Philadelphia Orchestra Club and then became promotion manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Wrote Historical Novel         In 1945, she went to San Francisco as an observer at the birth of the United Nations.         Mrs. Jacobs moved to New York in 1954, where she was an officer of numerous civic and educational organizations. She was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Committee on Africa, Howard University, Planned Parenthood-World Population and the Rachel Carson Trust for the Living Environment.         She was the author of a historical novel, "The Clark Inheritance," based on her family's history in the develpment of the coal mines of Pennsylvania. She is remembered by many as Sophy, the group leader, in her friend Emily Kimbrough's book, "Pleasure by the Busload."         Besides her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Denholm Muir Jacobs of Northeast Harbor; 6 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Olive A. Beech, a leader in the aviation industry and a co-founder and chairwoman of the Beech Aircraft Company, died yesterday at her home in Wichita, Kan., at the age of 89, her family said.         Under her leadership, Beech Aircraft became a leading manufacturer of private airplanes for general aviation, including propeller, turbo-prop and jet planes. It also won missile and space contracts.         Mrs. Beech's career began by chance. As a young woman, she was hired in 1925 as the secretary to Walter Beech, the director of the Travel Air Manufacturing Company in Wichita. They later married.         In 1932 they formed their company as the Beechcraft company, with Mrs. Beech as the secretary-treasurer. While her husband was a talented designer of planes, she emerged as the hard-driving supervisor and shrewd manager of the corporate finances.         When Mr. Beech suffered encephalitis in 1940, she took full command and retained much of that control even after he returned to work.         Upon his death in 1950, she took over as president and chairwoman. She gave up the presidency in 1968 and remained as chairwoman until 1982, then became chairwoman emeritus.         The company grew from having a handful of employees to a payroll of more than 10,000 and annual sales exceeding $900 million.         The Raytheon Company bought Beech Aircraft in 1980, and she was elected to the parent company's board and executive committee.         Mrs. Beech was a past president of the Women's International Association of Aeronautics and a leader in other aviation organizations. She was appointed to national boards by Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon.         Fortune magazine twice named her as one of the top 10 women in business in the 1970's. She was awarded the aviation industry's Wright Brothers Trophy and was inducted into the Aviation Hall of Fame. She was also active in many charitable organizations.         Mrs. Beech was born on a farm in Waverly, Kan., and grew up in Paola, Kan. She displayed her budding managerial talent at the age of 11 when she took over some of the family's financial chores, including paying its bills. She was educated at the American Secretarial and Business College in Wichita.         Surviving are two daughters, Suzanne Beech Warner of Boulder City, Nev., and Mary Lynn Oliver of Wichita, and three grandchildren.       
         Helen Kaplan, who devoted her life to helping retarded children and making the public aware of their needs, died on Wednesday at Central General Hospital in Plainview, L.I. A resident of Old Westbury, she was 82.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Kaplan was a founder and charter member of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, Nassau County Chapter. She served as its secretary, vice president and president, and finally, from 1961 until 1988, as its executive director. After that, she continued to attend functions and maintained an active interest in the organization until her death.         In the late 1940's retarded children had few opportunities in education, training or recreation. This led to the birth of the association in New York City in 1949. News quickly spread to Long Island and the Nassau chapter sprang up the same year. Son Died of Leukemia         Mrs. Kaplan's first child, David, was retarded, and died of leukemia at the age of 9 in 1952, two years after she opened the fledgling association's first day camp for 24 children. In 1950 she started a demonstration training program, which she ran for eight years.         She became the guiding force behind the growth of the Nassau Association for the Help of Retarded Children, whose more than 8,000 members support educational, vocational, residential and other programs to serve 1,400 children and adults and their families. She spent 11 years as a full-time volunteer until the death of her husband, Allan, in 1960, when she joined the salaried staff.         The New York association now has chapters in nearly every county and sister organizations across the country. The statewide group, Nysarc Inc., belongs to the Arc of the United States.         Mrs. Kaplan grew up in Philadelphia. She graduated from the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music and was an accomplished pianist.         She sat on several influential committees and received many honors. Among them was the first Helen Award, created by a State Commissioner of Mental Health, Alan Miller, and named after her.         Mrs. Kaplan is survived by another son, Michael, of Manhattan, and a grandson.       
         Tatiana Troyanos, an American mezzo-soprano whose enormous repertory covered the full range of operatic history, from Monteverdi to Philip Glass, died on Saturday evening at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her manager, Janice Mayer at Columbia Artists, said the cause was cancer.         Miss Troyanos's dark, flexible mezzo was ideal for the wrenching emotionalism of such characters as Carmen, Kundry in Wagner's "Parsifal," Eboli in Verdi's "Don Carlo," Santuzza in Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," and both Purcell's and Berlioz's Didos.         She was also a superb player of trouser roles. Her Octavian in "Rosenkavalier" was long the centerpiece of her repertory, and early in her career she gave highly regarded performances as Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Romeo in Bellini's "Capuletti e i Montecchi." And she was prized for the kind of vocal and dramatic agility, as well as the ability to learn difficult roles quickly, that made her a singer of choice for revivals of rarely performed Handel and Mozart works.         Her appearances in the last year indicate the scope of her repertory. In September she created the role of Queen Isabella in Philip Glass's "Voyage" at the Met. She performed in two "Ring" cycles, as Waltraute in the Metropolitan Opera's "Gotterdammerung" and Fricka in the Lyric Opera of Chicago's "Rheingold." In May she gave what James R. Oestreich called in The New York Times "a searching, almost harrowing reading" of the Mahler Third Symphony with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, and last month she sang Clairon in the San Francisco Opera production of Strauss's "Capriccio."         Tatiana Troyanos was born in New York on September 12, 1938, and grew up in Forest Hills. Her mother was German and her father Greek, and though she admittedly neither spoke Greek nor cared for Greek food, she identified closely with her father's homeland and described herself as Greek-American.         Both her parents were singers, and she sang in school and church choruses, but her first serious musical training was as a pianist. It was only during her high school years, when she began to listen to Maria Callas recordings and attend Metropolitan Opera performances as a standee, that she decided to study singing. While working at Random House as a secretary she enrolled at the Juilliard School, but left when the dean refused to let her study with the teacher of her choice, Hans Heinz. She studied privately with him for many years, continuing even after she began to sing professionally.         Miss Troyanos found few opportunities in New York, but she was a fighter: When the Met offered her small roles, she turned them down, and when she was denied a chorus role in "The Sound of Music" because Richard Rodgers thought her too glamorous to play a nun, she returned looking disheveled and got the part. Her first break was in 1963, when Julius Rudel signed her to the New York City Opera roster. She made her debut that year as Hippolyta in Benjamin Britten's "Midsummer Night's Dream," and also sang Jocasta in Stravinsky's "Oedipus Rex."         In 1965, following Heinz's suggestion that she would benefit from experience at a European house, she joined the Hamburg State Opera, where she made her way through a large part of the mezzo-soprano repertory in her decade there. But her first major appearances were at Aix-en-Provence, France, where she made her debut in 1966 as the Composer in Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos," and at Covent Garden, where she performed her first Octavian in 1969, learning the role in a week to fill in for another singer.         Miss Troyanos made her Met debut as Octavian in 1976, and became one of the house's most frequently heard mezzos. Among the many roles she sang there were the Countess Geschwitz in Berg's "Lulu," Sesto in Mozart's "Clemenza di Tito," Charlotte in "Werther," Adalgisa in "Norma," and her regular showpieces, Carmen, Kundry, Santuzza and the Composer.         In addition to her opera appearances, Miss Troyanos was an eloquent recitalist. Particularly interesting in recent years were her duo recitals with the soprano Benita Valente. After their last New York performance together, at Alice Tully Hall in January 1992, Bernard Holland wrote in The Times: "Ms. Troyanos's mezzo-soprano is intended less as a thing of beauty (which it often is) than as a conduit for the pain, exaltation and rushes of emotion that suffuse her musical personality."  A Recorded Legacy         Miss Troyanos made many first-rate recordings. Among those available on compact disk are performances in Leonard Bernstein's recording of his "West Side Story" (Deutsche Grammophon), "Carmen" (London), "Werther" (Angel), "Cosi Fan Tutte" (RCA), "Le Nozze di Figaro" (Deutsche Grammophon) and Schoenberg's "Gurre-Lieder" (Philips). Her recent San Francisco appearance in "Capriccio" was taped for video release; other video performances include a memorable Sesto in the Jean-Pierre Ponelle production of "La Clemenza di Tito" (Deutsche Grammophon) and, with the Metropolitan Opera, Venus in Wagner's "Tannhauser" and Dido in Berlioz's "Troyens."         She is survived by her mother, Hildegard Fournier of Florida, and her brother, John, of New York.       
         Elizabeth Sullivan Ridder, a philanthropist who was formerly the national secretary of the Girl Scouts of America, died on Thursday in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 93 and formerly lived on the East Side of Manhattan.         She had been in declining health for almost a year, said Maureen Ridder, a great-granddaughter.         Mrs. Ridder was on the national board of the Girl Scouts from 1946 to 1958 and from 1961 to 1970 and was national secretary from 1950 to 1968. She was treasurer of the Girl Scouts' western hemisphere committee from 1963 to 1973.         Other beneficiaries of her philanthropy included Casita Maria, a settlement house in the Hunts Point section of the Bronx. She was a co-founder of Casita Maria in 1934 in Harlem. 1942 Award From Pope         She was a former member of the boards of directors of the Welfare Council of New York City and the National Conference of Catholic Charities.         Born in Amsterdam, N.Y., she grew up in Manhattan, graduated from Trinity College in Washington and did graduate work at Columbia.         She received the Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice award from Pope Pius XII in 1942 and the Catholic Youth Organization award in 1958 for "outstanding service and inspiration to youth" among numerous other awards.         Mrs. Ridder's husband of 20 years, Charles H. Ridder, publisher of The Catholic News, the weekly newspaper for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New york, died in 1964.         She is survived by two stepsons, Henry, of Pearl River, N.Y., and Thomas, of Maui, Hawaii; a stepdaughter, Katherine Wetzel of Belford, N.J.; grandchildren and great-grandchildren.       
         Lenore Blanchard Stoughton, a New York City lawyer who specialized in trademark and copyright law for 65 years, died on Aug. 30 at a nursing home in Kingston, N.Y. She was 88.         Her family said she had had a long illness.         Mrs. Stoughton had lived in New York, where she was a senior partner in the firm of Rogers Hoge & Hills. For many years she was one of the few women in her profession.         She was born in Otsego County in New York in 1905. She received her law degree at the Albany Law School of Union University and was admitted to the bar in 1927.         When she came to New York City, she was unable to find work as a lawyer. Determined to work, she became a switchboard operator in the offices of Rogers & Ramsey. She then became secretary to the senior partner, Edward S. Rogers, who was an expert in trademark law.         She later joined the legal staff as an associate attorney, assisting James F. Hoge. She became a partner in the successor firm of Rogers Hoge & Hills in 1947 and a senior partner in 1952. She retired in 1980 but remained counsel to the firm until its trademark practice was merged with the firm of Pennie & Edmonds in 1987.         She was the widow of Philip Van Everen Stoughton. She is survived by a daughter, Lenore Ridgway of Kingston, N.Y., three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Peggy Dennis, a Communist organizer and author, died on Sept. 25 at the Jewish Home for the Aged in San Francisco. She was 84.         The cause was complications from several strokes, said her son, Eugene Dennis Vrana.         Ms. Dennis was the wife of Eugene Dennis, general secretary of the American Communist Party from 1946 to 1959 and one of 12 American Communists jailed in the late 1940's for violating the Smith Act by conspiring to overthrow the Government. Ms. Dennis worked mostly in internal party organizing and for many years served as a courier of messages to Communist leaders in Germany, Poland, France and other countries.         After 1949, she worked primarily as a journalist at The Daily Worker and The People's World. She also wrote many freelance articles on politics and economics for socialist and liberal magazines including The Progressive and The Nation. She moved to San Francisco in 1961 after Mr. Dennis died.         In 1977, a year after she resigned from the Communist Party because of differences with its leadership, she wrote a book based on her experiences as an organizer, "The Autobiography of an American Communist: A Personal View of a Political Life."         A documentary about her life with Mr. Dennis, called "Love in the Cold War," was produced in 1991 by American Experience and Windfall Films and shown on public television in 1992.         Ms. Dennis is survived by two sons, Mr. Vrana of San Francisco and Timur Timofeev of Moscow, and a niece, Laura Bock of San Francisco.       
         Ruth Gilbert, a stage actress discovered by Eugene O'Neill who went on to perform on television as Milton Berle's lovesick, scatterbrained secretary, Max, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in New York.         The cause was brain cancer, said Dick Davis, a friend.         Miss Gilbert, a graduate of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, made her Broadway debut in "Girls in Uniform," in 1932. In 1933, she was cast by O'Neill in the role of Muriel in the Theater Guild production of "Ah, Wilderness!" starring George M. Cohan.         O'Neill also cast her in "The Iceman Cometh" in 1946, as the young streetwalker, Pearl. Miss Gilbert, a member of the Group Theater for two years, also appeared as Sadie in John Howard Lawson's "Processional" at the Federal Theater Project in 1937. She also replaced Lee Grant as the shoplifter in the Broadway run of "Detective Story" in 1949. A Famous Line         After a successful stint as a radio actress, she played the secretary on "The Milton Berle Show," and her repetitious plea, "Let's not fight this, Mil-l-ton, it's bigger than both of us," became a line repeated and laughed at across the country.         In 1954, Miss Gilbert made headlines when she became pregnant and was dismissed from the program with no guarantee of reinstatement. The dispute was resolved and she returned to the program after she gave birth.         In recent years, she performed in summer stock and acted on the stage and in television.         She is survived by her husband, Emanuel Feinberg; a brother, Edward Gilbert; a daughter, Dr. Jaimy Honig, and two grandchildren, all of New York City.         Correction:  October 22, 1993, Friday         An obituary last Friday about the actress Ruth Gilbert misstated the place of her death. She had been a patient at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, but she died at a hospice at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.       
         Yolanda Serrano, the head of a private addiction and AIDS prevention organization in New York City that fought for the distribution of free needles and syringes to prevent infection, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center. She was 45.         Her associates said the cause was cancer.         Mrs. Serrano startled the authorities in 1988 when she said she would defy a New York State law banning the unauthorized use of needles and syringes. She said she would distribute clean needles and syringes to drug addicts who were infecting themselves with the virus that causes AIDS through injections with contaminated needles.         Her pressure led to a pilot needle-exchange program by the New York City Department of Health. But Mayor David N. Dinkins stopped the program shortly after taking office in 1990, fearing, he said, that the sanctioning of a needle-exchange program might encourage drug use and send the wrong message to young people.         Nevertheless, Mrs. Serrano's nonprofit organization, Adapt, or the Association for Drug Abuse Prevention and Treatment, continued to defy state law by giving out clean needles to addicts, and the police rarely interfered. 'To Take the First Step'         Mrs. Serrano said she and her organization risked prosecution because the AIDS epidemic threatened addicts and their families with death. "Somebody has to take the first step," she said.         At the time, the City Health Commissioner, Dr. Stephen C. Joseph, who supported a pilot needle-exchange program, said he could not condone an illegal action. But he praised Adapt as a "group that clearly has a great deal of expertise, the most credible community action group in New York City, a very responsible group."         Today, the tide against needle exchanges has turned, and Adapt is one of five groups in the city that have received contracts from the State Department of Health to exchange needles, in part because intravenous drug users and their companions now represent the fasting-growing groups at risk of AIDS.         For years Mrs. Serrano and volunteers from such groups as Act Up and the Gay Men's Health Crisis combed alleys and abandoned buildings in the worst areas of the city seeking to talk addicts into exchanging their needles for clean ones.         Mrs. Serrano was born in Puerto Rico, lived in Brooklyn and graduated from St. Francis College in Brooklyn. She worked in the Narcotics Bureau of the Brooklyn District Attorney, the Victim's Services Agency and the State Division of Criminal Justice Services. Her concern about drug abuse grew from her 10 years as a substance abuse specialist at Long Island College Hospital, where she saw the initial ravages of the AIDS epidemic in the early 1980's.         As the founder of Adapt, Mrs. Serrano took part in several Federal and state panels dealing with drug addiction and AIDS. She was vice president of the Hispanic AIDS Forum, secretary of the Latino Commission on AIDS and a member of the Health and Human Services H.I.V. Planning Council of New York.         Mrs. Serrano was also a consultant to the Government of Australia's AIDS prevention programs and presented papers at many national and international AIDS conferences.         A funeral service will be held at 9:30 A.M. tomorrow at St. Agnes Roman Catholic Church, 417 Sackett Street, Brooklyn.         She is survived by her parents, Dhelia and Gaspar Serrano; two daughters, Beverly and Starr Astor; three sisters, Nora, Maria and Debbie, and a brother, Michael.       
         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades. Turned Into Ideal Mother         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929. 'The Thin Man,' a 'Quickie'         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas -- "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget "B" movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit. In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing. Started on Stage in 1960         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer-screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Some of the Best Years of Her Life         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films, including the following.         The Jazz Singer 1927         The Mask of Fu Manchu 1932         Penthouse 1933         The Thin Man 1934         Manhattan Melodrama 1934         The Great Ziegfeld 1936         After the Thin Man 1936         Test Pilot 1938         Too Hot to Handle 1938         The Best Years of Our Lives 1946         Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House 1948         Cheaper by the Dozen 1950         From the Terrace 1960         Midnight Lace 1960         The End 1978         Just Tell Me What You Want 1980

         Margaret Landon, whose novel "Anna and the King of Siam" was the inspiration for the Broadway musical "The King and I," died on Saturday at the Hermitage retirement home in Alexandria, Va. She was 90.         Although Mrs. Landon spent more than 10 years in Siam, now Thailand, it was not her story, but that of Anna Leonowens, that was the basis for Mrs. Landon's 1944 book. While living in Siam, Mrs. Landon discovered the autobiographical books by Anna Leonowens, a Welsh widow who was a governess, teacher and secretary in the court of King Mongkut in the 1860's.         The story in Mrs. Landon's book was told in a 1946 film starring Irene Dunne, as Anna, and Rex Harrison, as the king. But it was the 1956 musical by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d that immortalized the story of the Mrs. Leonowens and her extraordinary relationship with the King of Siam. 10 Years as a Missionary         Margaret Dorothea Mortensen was born in 1903 in Somers, Wis., and grew up in Evanston, Ill. A 1925 graduate of Wheaton College in Illinois, she married Kenneth Landon, a seminary student whom she met on campus, in 1926. In 1927 the couple set out for Siam as educational missionaries for the Presbyterian Church. There, Mrs. Landon discovered the books "The English Governess at the Siamese Court" and "The Romance of the Harem," and the letters of Mrs. Leonowens.         After 10 years in Siam, Mrs. Landon returned to the United States with her family in 1937. Beginning by writing articles about Anna Leonowens, Mrs. Landon eventually wove together history, biography and a fictionalization of the Welsh woman's story into her best-selling novel.         In 1942 Mrs. Landon moved with her family to Washington, where her husband was a Government specialist on Southeast Asia. She wrote one other book, "Never Dies the Dream," published in 1948.         Mrs. Landon's husband died on Aug. 26. She is survived by two daughters, Margaret Schoenherr of Palos Heights, Ill., and Carol Pearson of Clinton, S.C.; two sons, William, of Bellevue, Wash., and Kenneth Jr., of Washington; 13 grandchildren, and 27 great-grandchildren.
