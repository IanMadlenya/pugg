         Muriel Costa-Greenspon, a mezzo-soprano who was a fixture at the New York City Opera for 30 years, died on Dec. 26 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68.         Her death was due to natural causes, said her son, Stefano Costa.         A reliable character mezzo, Ms. Costa-Greenspon consistently won critical praise for her musicianship, singing and acting. After making her City Opera debut as Olga Olsen in Kurt Weill's ''Street Scene'' in 1963, she went on to sing everything from Augusta in Douglas Moore's ''Ballad of Baby Doe'' to the three mezzo roles in Puccini's ''Trittico'' to the Old Lady in Leonard Bernstein's ''Candide.''         She had a particular association with the composer Gian Carlo Menotti. She made her professional debut in his ''Old Maid and the Thief'' and later sang the title role in his ''Medium'' at the Festival of Two Worlds (which Mr. Menotti founded), in Spoleto, Italy, among other places. At City Opera, her Menotti roles included parts in ''The Consul'' and ''The Saint of Bleecker Street.''         Muriel Greenspon was born in Detroit in 1937 to deaf parents. She received her B.A. and M.A. from the University of Michigan, and began her opera career singing arias in a restaurant.         Her husband, Giorgio Costa, a carpenter at the Metropolitan Opera and on various Broadway shows, also survives her. In 1984, the two enjoyed a burst of fame when Ms. Costa-Greenspon won $1.7 million in the New York State Lotto game.         Neither quit their day jobs. Ms. Costa-Greenspon continued to appear at City Opera until 1993. She then volunteered in the musical theater program at the Bronx High School of Science, helping to stage student shows.       
         Alida Valli, an Italian movie star who was described by both David O. Selznick and Benito Mussolini as the most beautiful woman in the world after Greta Garbo and who appeared in more than 100 films, died on Saturday at her home in Rome. She was 84.         The office of the mayor of Rome, Walter Veltroni, announced the death to The Associated Press and other news organizations; the cause was not revealed.         If there is one role for which film buffs particularly revere Ms. Valli, it is that of Anna Schmidt, the tragic Czech refugee heroine of Carol Reed's ''Third Man'' (1949). She was cast in that movie, based on the Graham Greene novel, after being summoned to Hollywood by Selznick. He insisted that she take the name Valli, hoping it would have the same magic as Garbo.         But first he cast her with Gregory Peck in Hitchcock's ''Paradine Case'' and in ''The Miracle of the Bells,'' with Frank Sinatra.         Ms. Valli's own life could well have inspired a screenplay. She was born in Pula, which is now in Croatia. According to the local-history Web site www.istrianet.org, she was born Alida Maria Laura von Altenburger, baroness of Marckenstein and Freuenberg, on May 3, 1921; her father was an Austrian journalist.         The family moved to Como, Italy, and when she was 15 Ms. Valli enrolled at the Rome filmmaking school established by Mussolini.         Her first movie role was in ''The Two Sergeants'' (1936). She then appeared in several costume dramas and ''white telephone'' movies, as shallow comedies of the 1940's were known in Italy. The most acclaimed and controversial movie she made during the war was ''We the Living, '' a two-part anti-Communist film based, without the author's permission, on an Ayn Rand novel.         Rather than comply with the dictates of the fascist government, Ms. Valli retreated into hiding and in 1944 married Oscar de Mejo, a Surrealist painter and composer, whose most successful song was ''All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth.'' In 1945 she resumed her acting career, and two years later she went to California with de Mejo, from whom she was divorced in 1952.         But when her strong Italian accent proved to be a barrier to many roles, she returned to Italy, where she worked with great directors like Michelangelo Antonioni, Pier Paolo Pasolini and Bernardo Bertolucci, as well as Claude Chabrol and René Clément. She starred in the Luchino Visconti film ''Senso'' (1953), a role that won her the best-actress award at the 1954 Venice Film Festival.         Her career suffered another setback that year when she was called to testify in a trial following a young woman's murder. After the trial, she struggled to restore her career, but it took several years. According to The Guardian of London, she lived for three years in Mexico, where she married Giancarlo Zagni, but again returned to Italy.         One of Ms. Valli's most recent appearances was in 1995, in ''A Month at the Lake,'' with Vanessa Redgrave. As time passed and her face became gaunt, she took up the horror film genre, in movies like ''Les Yeux Sans Visage'' (''Eyes Without a Face''), made in France.         Ms. Valli is survived by two sons, Carlo and Larry de Mejo.         Correction:  April 26, 2006, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about the Italian film star Alida Valli misstated the origin of ''The Third Man,'' the movie in which she made her most famous Hollywood appearance. The story was initially a screenplay by Graham Greene, not a novel; he later adapted it as a novel. In addition, The obituary also misidentified the composer of the song ''All I Want for Christmas Is My Two Front Teeth.'' It was Don Gardner, not Ms. Valli's husband Oscar de Mejo.       
         The mezzo-soprano Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, who won near universal praise from critics and audiences for her courageous, insightful and deeply affecting artistry, died on Monday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 52.         Her death was reported by Alec C. Treuhaft, senior vice president of IMG Artists, speaking on behalf of the singer's husband, the composer Peter Lieberson. Mr. Treuhaft would only say that Ms. Hunt Lieberson had died ''after a long illness.''         For the last 18 months she had sung only sporadically, canceling most performances, citing lingering problems from an injury to her lower back as the cause. Yet she had had a public bout with breast cancer some years ago, which caused her to withdraw from, among other major performances, the premiere of Kaija Saariaho's opera ''L'Amour de Loin'' at the Salzburg Festival in 2000. Mr. Treuhaft said that even close associates of Ms. Hunt Lieberson, an intensely private person, did not realize that her illness had become so critical in recent weeks.         If she rarely spoke of her private life, few artists have brought such emotional vulnerability to their work, whether it was her sultry portrayal of Myrtle Wilson, the mistress of wealthy Tom Buchanan in John Harbison's ''Great Gatsby,'' the role of her 1999 Metropolitan Opera debut, or her shattering performances several years ago in two Bach cantatas for solo voice and orchestra, staged by the director Peter Sellars, seen in Lincoln Center's New Visions series, with the Orchestra of Emmanuel Music, Craig Smith conducting.         In Cantata No. 82, ''Ich Habe Genug'' (''I Have Enough''), Ms. Hunt Lieberson, wearing a flimsy hospital gown and thick woolen socks, her face contorted with pain and yearning, portrayed a terminally ill patient who, no longer able to endure treatments, wants to let go and be comforted by Jesus. During one consoling aria, ''Schlummert ein, ihr matten Augen'' (''Slumber now, weary eyes''), she yanked tubes from her arms and sang the spiraling melody with an uncanny blend of ennobling grace and unbearable sadness.         Still, vocal artistry alone could not account for the impact of Ms. Hunt Lieberson's performances and her consequent desire to keep her private life private, as Mr. Harbison, quoted in an article in The New York Times last year, explained. ''Lorraine gives so much of her inner soul,'' he said, ''that that's what she owes the public.''         Ms. Hunt Lieberson had a maverick career. She brought uncompromising integrity to her choice of roles and repertory, was a champion of Baroque operas and of living composers, and preferred to work in close-knit conditions with directors and ensembles who shared her artistic aims, especially at festivals like Glyndebourne in England and Aix-en-Provence in France.         That she began her professional life as a freelance violist and did not focus fully on singing until she was 26 may account for the musical depth and intelligence of her vocal artistry. One of her closest colleagues, Craig Smith, the Boston-based conductor and choir director, said as much in a 2004 profile of Ms. Hunt Lieberson by Charles Michener in The New Yorker. ''There's something viola-like about the rich graininess of her singing, about her ability to sound a tone from nothing,'' he was quoted as saying, adding, ''There's no sudden switching on of the voice, no click.''         Though her work seldom drew less than raves from critics, her singing eluded description. Despite the gleaming richness of her sound, her voice somehow conveyed poignant intimacy. Although she paid scrupulous attention to rhythm, phrasing and text, she came across as utterly spontaneous. Her person disappeared into her performances. And yet in a Handel aria, a Britten cantata or a song by her husband, she could be so revealing you sometimes wanted to avert your eyes for fear of intruding.         It was typical of the self-effacing Ms. Hunt Lieberson to be drawn to the secondary role of Myrtle in ''The Great Gatsby'' for her Met debut. Her second appearance in a Met production came in 2003 when she sang the role of Dido in the new staging of Berlioz's epic ''Les Troyens.'' With this luminous, stylistically informed and emotionally true portrayal she showed that she could galvanize the Met's stage in a major role. She was scheduled to return this coming season in a new production by Mark Morris of Gluck's ''Orfeo ed Euridice,'' singing Orfeo.         Lorraine Hunt was born on March 1, 1954, in San Francisco to musical parents: Randolph Hunt, a music teacher and a conductor of community ensembles and operas, and Marcia Hunt, a contralto and a voice teacher. Her parents survive her, along with two siblings, Stan Hunt and Susan Hunt. Another sister, Alexis, died of cancer six years ago.         Her taskmaster father was single-minded in his desire to develop her musical gifts, arranging first for her to study the piano and then the violin, she said in the New Yorker profile. At 12 she switched to viola and began playing in youth orchestras and singing in the high school choir.         She studied voice and viola at San Jose State University and, upon graduation, became a freelance player in the Bay Area noted for her expertise in contemporary music. She played in a cutting-edge string quartet called ''Novaj Kordoj'' (Esperanto for ''New Strings''). When a French horn player she was dating got a job with the Boston Symphony Orchestra, she moved with him to Boston, soon becoming a valued freelance musician. She was particularly drawn to the music program at Emmanuel Church in the Back Bay section of Boston, where Mr. Smith conducted the orchestra and choir. But during these years she also studied voice at Boston Conservatory.         Her breakthrough as a singer came with the Pepsico Summerfare festival in Purchase, N.Y., in 1985 when she was cast by Mr. Sellars in his production of Handel's ''Giulio Cesare.'' Her role was Sesto, the avenging son of Pompey, though in this production, zapped to the present day Middle East, Sesto was a terrorist armed with an Uzi. While Mr. Sellars's work was predictably controversial, Ms. Hunt Lieberson emerged as an exciting vocal talent.         For the next decade her career thrived as she collaborated with the early-music conductor Nicholas McGegan and the Philharmonia Baroque Orchestra on a series of Harmonia Mundi recordings of Handel operas and oratorios (''Susanna,'' ''Theodora,'' ''Ariodante''); took part in Mr. Sellars's updated production of Mozart's ''Don Giovanni'' and, later, his triumphant staging of ''Theodora'' at Glyndebourne; and worked with William Christie and other major musicians.         She met Mr. Lieberson in 1997 when he selected her to sing in the premiere of his opera ''Ashoka's Dream'' at the Santa Fe Opera. The story tells of an Indian emperor in the third century B.C. who renounces violence after converting to Buddhism and inspires trust and generosity among his people. Ms. Hunt Lieberson sang Triraksha, Ashoka's consort.         She and Mr. Lieberson, a practicing Buddhist since his graduate-student days at Columbia, were immediately drawn to each other. At the time he was married with three daughters. After an understandably upsetting divorce for Mr. Lieberson, he and Ms. Hunt Lieberson were married in 1999. Their closeness was apparent to anyone who observed them onstage at Symphony Hall in Boston in November during the ovations for ''Neruda Songs,'' Mr. Lieberson's setting of five Spanish sonnets by Pablo Neruda, each a reflection of a different aspect of love.         The performance, with the Boston Symphony Orchestra conducted by James Levine, was repeated a few days later at Carnegie Hall. Every phrase of this emotionally unguarded, intricate and haunting work seemed fashioned by the composer for his wife's distinctive voice. It would be her last New York performance.       
         Dika Newlin, who composed a symphony at 11, became a distinguished composer and musicologist and emerged, in her 70's and 80's, as a most unlikely punk rocker, died on July 22 in Richmond, Va. She was 82.         The cause was complications of a broken arm she suffered on June 30, said Sabine Feisst, a professor of musicology at Arizona State University who is writing a book on Dr. Newlin.         ''It is hard to find out about me because I'm involved in so many different things,'' Dr. Newlin said in an interview with The Richmond Times-Dispatch in 1996. One continuing thread: she was a professor at various universities, until her retirement from Virginia Commonwealth University two years ago.         Her latest incarnation was as leather-clad, bright-orange-haired punk rocker and occasional Elvis impersonator, belting out songs like ''Love Songs for People Who Hate Each Other,'' which she wrote herself. Her flamboyant image was not exactly dulled when she posed in her 70's for a pinup calendar.         Dr. Newlin's earlier prominence grew out of her studies as a teenager with the composer Arnold Schoenberg. Dr. Newlin, among the last surviving pupils of Schoenberg, wrote the entry on him for the Encyclopaedia Britannica.         Dr. Feisst called Dr. Newlin ''one of the pioneers of Schoenberg research in America.'' Dr. Newlin's doctoral dissertation was published as the book ''Bruckner, Mahler, Schoenberg'' (1947, 1968). She also translated Schoenberg's works from German to English, and her publication of diaries she kept as his student provide some of the most intimate glimpses of him.         Dr. Newlin's own compositions reflect Schoenberg's innovative approach. Those works include three operas, a chamber symphony, a piano concerto and numerous chamber, vocal and mixed-media works. In 1999, she sang in a costumed performance of Schoenberg's ''Pierrot Lunaire,'' in her own English translation, in Lubbock, Tex.         In her punk incarnation, Dr. Newlin appeared in horror movies produced by Michael D. Moore in Richmond. In ''Creep'' (1995), directed by Tim Ritter, her character, clad in a leather motorcycle jacket, poisons baby food on a supermarket shelf.         Dr. Feisst confessed to finding this sort of thing ''puzzling and disturbing'' but said she came to view it as ''all part of the package.''         Mr. Moore also directed ''Dika: Murder City'' (1995), a documentary about Dr. Newlin.         Dika Newlin, an only child, was born in Portland, Ore., on Nov. 22, 1923. Her name, chosen by her mother, refers to an Amazon in one of Sappho's poems.         Her parents, both academics, soon moved to East Lansing, Mich., to teach at what is now Michigan State University. Dika could read dictionaries at 3, played the piano at 6 and began composing at 7.         She entered grade school at 5 and finished at 8. At 11, she wrote a symphonic piece, ''Cradle Song.'' Three years later, it was performed by the Cincinnati Symphony, with Vladimir Bakaleinikoff conducting.         She finished high school at 12 and was accepted as a college student by Michigan State, where, The New York Herald Tribune said in 1939, she had the highest I.Q. score in the school's history. At the time of the article, she was in New York to hear one of her compositions performed at the World's Fair.         After graduating from Michigan State at 16, she settled with her mother in Los Angeles so that she could attend the University of California at Los Angeles and study with Schoenberg, who taught there. She kept a diary, which she published as a book, ''Schoenberg Remembered: Diaries and Recollections (1938-76),'' in 1980.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review, Joan Peyser marveled at its ''absolute ingenuousness,'' saying Dr. Newlin seemed to have censored nothing.         In one entry, she tells how Schoenberg, an Austrian émigré she called Uncle Arnold, criticized her string-quartet style as ''too pianistic.'' She replied that she knew it wasn't the best writing. The entry continues, ''He replied, 'No, it is not the best, nor even the second best -- perhaps the 50th best, yes?' ''         She earned her doctorate in musicology from Columbia at 22. She studied piano with Artur Schnabel and Rudolf Serkin and made a half-dozen piano recordings in the United States and Europe. Many years later, in 2004, some of her punk numbers were released on an album called ''Ageless Icon: The Greatest Hits of Dika Newlin.''         Dr. Newlin, who never married, leaves no immediate family members. She has a surviving cousin and was close to her cat, Spot. She once kept eight or more cats. Reporters noted that she slept on a mattress on the floor with a medieval suit of armor dangling above.         She told The Richmond Times-Dispatch that she had always wanted to have a rock band, and hers surely carried her own brand. Who but Dr. Newlin could have taken the text Schoenberg used for the fourth movement of his second string quartet to use as punk lyrics for ''Alien Baby''?         ''I feel like a child more than I did as a child,'' she said in an interview with People magazine in 2003. ''I try more and more to live day by day, to do something because it feels good.''       
         Ruth Schonthal, an American composer and pianist of German birth whose eclectic music brought together elements as diverse as European Romanticism, Mexican folk song and Minimalism, died on July 10 at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 82.         The cause was complications of a recent heart attack, her son Al Seckel said.         Ms. Schonthal was born in Hamburg, Germany, on June 27, 1924, and began her musical studies at the Stern Conservatory in Berlin when she was 5. In 1935, she was expelled, along with other Jewish students, at the insistence of the Nazis, and in 1938 she emigrated with her family to Sweden, where she enrolled at the Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm. In 1941, the family fled Stockholm; unable to obtain a visa for the United States, they went to Mexico City.         In Mexico, Ms. Schonthal studied composition with Rodolfo Halffter and Manuel Ponce, and in 1946 she gave the premiere of her Concerto Romantico for Piano and Orchestra. The composer Paul Hindemith, who was in the audience, invited her to study with him at Yale. She graduated from Yale in 1948, and at first earned a living by writing advertising jingles and popular songs.         But she also performed as a concert pianist and was highly regarded for her improvisatory skills. And she composed prolifically, often drawn to social, historical and religious themes. Among her chamber works, for example, are ''The Wall Before and After'' (1994), about the reunification of Berlin; ''Bells of Sarajevo,'' for clarinet and prepared piano (1997); and her Quartet No. 3, ''Holocaust in Memoriam'' (also 1997).         She also wrote ''Fantasy-Variations on a Jewish Liturgical Theme,'' for electric guitar (1994); a handful of orchestral scores, including ''The Beautiful Days of Aranjuez,'' for harp and strings (1981); and three operas: ''The Courtship of Camilla'' (1979), ''Princess Maleen'' (1989) and ''Jocasta'' (1997), which offers a feminist view of the Oedipus story.         But her music found an audience in Germany, and in 1994 she was awarded the Heidelberg International Composition Prize for Women Composers. The same year, a biography, ''Ruth Schonthal: A Composer's Musical Development in Exile,'' by Martina Helmig, was published in Germany, and later in an English translation.         Ms. Schonthal was also on the composition faculty at New York University and the Westchester Conservatory of Music.         In addition to her son Al Seckel, of Malibu, Calif., Ms. Schonthal is survived by her husband, Paul Seckel, an artist, of New Rochelle, and two other sons, Bernhard and Ben, both of Scarsdale.         Before Ms. Schonthal returned to Germany for the first time, in 1983, she told The New York Times: ''I have quite strong cultural ties to Germany from before Hitler. I love to speak the language, but I'm only going for professional reasons. I have no desire to return there except for a visit like this.''       
         Isabel Bigley, who won a Tony award in 1951 playing Sarah Brown, the Salvation Army missionary who falls in love with a handsome gambler in the raucous Broadway hit ''Guys and Dolls,'' died Saturday in Los Angeles. She was 80, and lived in Los Angeles and Rancho Mirage, Calif.         The cause was pulmonary disease, her son Lawrence Barnett Jr. said.         With a powerful, wide-ranging voice, the raven-haired Miss Bigley belted out ''If I Were a Bell,'' when her character realized that she had fallen for Sky Masterson, one of the sinners she had come to save from the gaudy environs of gamblers, showgirls and cops on Broadway.         ''If I were a bell I would be ringing,'' Miss Bigley sang. ''If I were a lamp I'd light.''         The song was originally written for another character, but that performer had difficulty handling it. The composer, Frank Loesser, reworked it for the Sarah Brown character, and it became the signature song of Miss Bigley's career.         The show, based on a story by Damon Runyon, had a long and triumphant run, produced many hits that have become standard songs, and is frequently revived. Miss Bigley stayed with the original production for three years.         Miss Bigley, who also played leading roles in ''Oklahoma!'' and ''Me and Juliet,'' was a frequent performer on television in its early days, appearing on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' and ''The Colgate Comedy Hour.'' On June 25, 1951, she -- along with other entertainers like Arthur Godfrey, Garry Moore and Faye Emerson -- appeared on an hourlong CBS program that was the start of nationally broadcast color television.         In 1958, Miss Bigley retired to raise her family.         Isabel Bigley Barnett was born in the Bronx on Feb. 23, 1926, the only child of Joseph and Isabel Press Bigley. Besides her son Lawrence, of Los Angeles, Miss Bigley is survived by her husband of 53 years, Lawrence R. Barnett, whom she met when he was president of the Music Corporation of America, a major talent agency; three other sons, Robert, of Denver, William, of Los Angeles and James, of Atherton, Calif.; two daughters, Claudia Scott of Concord, N.H., and Laurey Treiger of Los Angeles; 16 grandchildren and 4 great-grandchildren.         ''Ever since I was 12 years old I've been studying for a career in theater,'' Miss Bigley wrote in a first-person article for The World Telegram in 1952, shortly before the end of her run in ''Guys and Dolls.'' She took voice lessons at Walton High School in the Bronx and then during the summer at Juilliard. She also learned stenography and began working at a Wall Street law firm.         One day, Miss Bigley asked for an extended lunch hour and took a 20-minute subway ride to an audition for the chorus in ''Oklahoma!'' To her surprise, she was signed as the understudy for the lead role of the farm girl Laurey.         ''I left a pile of unanswered letters on the desk,'' she wrote.         Soon after, the producers sent Miss Bigley to London to take over as Laurey in the Drury Lane production of ''Oklahoma.'' She played that role there for three years, then came back to the United States for screen tests in Hollywood, which did not go too well.         After returning to New York, she auditioned for ''Guys and Dolls'' and was cast as Sarah Brown, her first leading role on Broadway. The production ''has the most flamboyant population of any show in town,'' The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson wrote, and Miss Bigley ''plays a few enticing tricks on one of Mr. Loesser's most rollicking songs.''         In 1953, Miss Bigley played Jeanie in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Me and Juliet'' -- a Valentine to show business that chronicle's the backstage life of a successful Broadway musical.         ''It would be hard to collect a more attractive cast,'' Mr. Atkinson wrote of that show, ''than one that includes Isabel Bigley, a belle that is still ringing beautifully.''         Correction:  October 6, 2006, Friday  An obituary on Tuesday about Isabel Bigley, who won a Tony award in 1951 playing Sarah Brown, the missionary who falls in love with a gambler in the Broadway hit ''Guys and Dolls,'' misstated the name of the organization she represented. It was the fictional Save-a-Soul Mission, not the Salvation Army.       
         Betty Comden, who with her longtime collaborator Adolph Green wrote the lyrics and often the librettos for some of the most celebrated musicals of stage and screen, died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 89 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said Ronald Konecky, her lawyer and the executor of her estate.         During a professional partnership that lasted for more than 60 years, and which finally ended with Mr. Green's death in 2002, the Comden-Green blend of sophisticated wit and musical know-how lit up stage shows like ''On the Town,'' ''Wonderful Town,'' ''Peter Pan'' and ''Bells Are Ringing.'' Their Hollywood credits included the screenplays for two landmark film musicals, ''Singin' in the Rain'' and ''The Band Wagon.''         Through the years they worked with composers like Leonard Bernstein, Cy Coleman, Jule Styne and André Previn, creating songs like ''New York, New York,'' ''The Party's Over,'' ''It's Love'' and ''Some Other Time.'' They were adept at making their lyrics fit the mood, whether it was rueful (''Lonely Town''), raucous (''100 Easy Ways to Lose a Man'') or romantic (''Just in Time'').         The title of one of their own songs, from ''Bells Are Ringing,'' summed up their joint career: it was truly a ''Perfect Relationship'' in which they met daily, most often in Ms. Comden's living room, either to work on a show, to trade ideas or even just talk about the weather.         ''We stare at each other,'' Ms. Comden said in a 1977 interview with The New York Times. ''We meet, whether or not we have a project, just to keep up a continuity of working. There are long periods when nothing happens, and it's just boring and disheartening. But we have a theory that nothing's wasted, even those long days of staring at one another. You sort of have to believe that, don't you? That you had to go through all that to get to the day when something did happen.''         Ms. Comden, slim, dark-haired and composed, was the ideal counterbalance to the often rumpled, wild-haired and restless Mr. Green. Sometimes, during discussions, Ms. Comden would finish one of his sentences, or vice versa. Songs and shows grew that way too, although the story was always the starting point.         ''The book comes first,'' Ms. Comden said in the 1977 interview , recalling how the song ''Just in Time'' took shape. ''At some point when we were working on 'Bells Are Ringing,' '' she said, ''Jule Styne wrote that tune. Dee da dum, da dee da dee da dum. We all agreed it had to be in the show somewhere, but for months we couldn't find a place for it, or even a title, but Jule was playing it all over town at parties, calling it 'Dee Da Dum.' And that became the official title until the point where, rewriting part of the book one day, the situation was there, and we finally wrote the words to fit 'Dee Da Dum.' ''         The starting point for their partnership was Greenwich Village where, in the late 1930s, they joined up with another aspiring entertainer named Judy Holliday and two other friends to form a cabaret act. They called themselves the Revuers and persuaded Max Gordon, the owner of a club called the Village Vanguard, that their act would be good for business. It was.         The Revuers opened at the Vanguard in 1939, performing material that included freewheeling sketches like ''The Banshi Sisters'' and ''The Baroness Bazuka,'' a zany operetta, and frequently accompanied at the piano by one of Mr. Green's friends, a talented young musician named Leonard Bernstein, who dropped in often enough to be taken for part of their act.         The act's success earned them a movie offer, and the Revuers traveled west in hopes of finding instant fame in ''Greenwich Village,'' a 1944 movie starring Carmen Miranda and Don Ameche, in which the newcomers turned out to be virtually invisible. Ms. Comden and Mr. Green came back to New York, where they resumed working at the Vanguard and other clubs.         It wasn't long before they heard from Mr. Bernstein, their erstwhile accompanist, who said he'd been working on a ballet with Jerome Robbins and that the two of them had decided that the ballet, called ''Fancy Free,'' had the makings of a Broadway show. They were looking for someone to write the book and lyrics.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green jumped at the chance and jumped into the limelight with their work on the show. The result, ''On the Town,'' the story of three sailors on shore leave in New York, opened late in 1944 and was a smash. Both Ms. Comden and Mr. Green appeared in the show, he as one of the sailors and she as Claire de Loone, an amorous anthropologist. New Yorkers inside and outside the theater were soon humming the town's geography à la Comden and Green:         The Bronx is up and the Battery's down,         The people ride in a hole in the ground,         New York, New York,         It's a helluva town.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green were definitely on their way up, not to the Bronx but to big-time success.         Betty Comden was born Elizabeth Cohen on May 3, 1917, in Brooklyn. Her father, Leo, was a lawyer, her mother, Rebecca, a teacher. She attended Erasmus Hall High School and studied drama at New York University, graduating in 1938.         By that time she had changed her surname to Comden, had had nose surgery to make her look more stageworthy, had acted with the Washington Square Players and had met and become friends with Mr. Green, another aspiring actor. Their circle soon included three other would-be entertainers, Ms. Holliday, Alvin Hammer and John Frank. Then came their decision to form the Revuers, and all else followed.         Ms. Comden married Steven Kyle, a designer and businessman, in 1942. He died in 1979, and she never remarried. They had two children, a daughter, Susanna, and a son, Alan. Their son, a drug addict, contracted AIDS and died of complications of his addiction in 1990. She is survived by her daughter, Susanna Kyle, of Manhattan.         Ms. Comden reminisced about her Brooklyn childhood, her student years and her long marriage in a 1995 memoir, ''Off Stage,'' in which she also told of the difficult circumstances of her son's struggle with drugs. The book included tributes to some of her friends and colleagues, among them Mr. Bernstein and Lauren Bacall, but hardly dealt at all with her professional life.         After the success of ''On the Town,'' Ms. Comden and Mr. Green tried their hands at writing the book for another Broadway musical. ''Billion Dollar Baby,'' which opened in 1945, had a score by Morton Gould, choreography by Mr. Robbins and was directed by George Abbott, but it was not as well received.         Hollywood called again, and this time, for the most part, they had better luck. ''Good News'' (1947), with June Allyson and Peter Lawford as singing, dancing campus sweethearts, was their first screenplay. They wrote ''The Barkleys of Broadway'' (1949), which marked the film reunion of Ginger Rogers and Fred Astaire, and adapted ''On the Town'' (1949) for the screen, with Gene Kelly, Frank Sinatra and Jules Munshin as the freewheeling sailors navigating the streets of New York.         They contributed heavily to the success of ''The Band Wagon'' (1953), the Vincente Minnelli musical for which they wrote the witty screenplay. The film had a score by Howard Dietz and Arthur Schwartz and starred Mr. Astaire, Cyd Charisse, Oscar Levant and Nanette Fabray. The Comden-Green screenplay received an Academy Award nomination.         They were still wedded to Broadway, however, and their stage work during the next few years included the Jule Styne musical ''Two on the Aisle'' (1951), a revue with Bert Lahr and Dolores Gray; ''Wonderful Town'' (1953), an adaptation of the 1939 comedy hit ''My Sister Eileen,'' with music by Mr. Bernstein and starring Rosalind Russell and Edie Adams as two sisters from Ohio trying to make it in the Big Town; and, most notably, ''Bells Are Ringing.''         That 1956 musical reunited them with Ms. Holliday, who headed the cast as an operator at an answering service who falls in love with one of the service's male clients (Sydney Chaplin) after listening to his voice over her telephone line. The score included the comic lament ''I'm Going Back (To the Bonjour Tristesse Brassiere Company)'' as well as some songs that became part of the standard pop repertory, like ''Just in Time,'' ''Long Before I Knew You'' and ''The Party's Over,'' which ended with the melancholy verse:         Now you must wake up         All dreams must end         Take off your makeup         The party's over         It's all over, my friend.         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green also wrote the screenplay for the 1960 film version, which starred Ms. Holliday.         Even their less successful shows yielded musical nuggets, one example being the 1960 ''Do Re Mi,'' which had a book by Garson Kanin and music by Mr. Styne for which they wrote the lyrics. It featured Phil Silvers and Nancy Walker. That largely unmemorable score included one gem, ''Make Someone Happy.''         Ms. Comden and Mr. Green went on to write ''Subways Are for Sleeping'' (1961), with Carol Lawrence and Mr. Chaplin, and ''Fade Out-Fade In'' (1964), with Carol Burnett and Jack Cassidy, both shows with music by Mr. Styne, and the lyrics for ''Hallelujah, Baby'' (1968), which had music by Mr. Styne and a book by Arthur Laurents and which starred Leslie Uggams and Robert Hooks. They wrote the book for ''Applause'' (1970), adapted from the film ''All About Eve,'' with music by Charles Strouse and lyrics by Lee Adams. The show starred Ms. Bacall as the take-no-prisoners movie queen Margo Channing played by Bette Davis in the film.         In the years that followed Ms. Comden and Mr. Green teamed up with the composer Cy Coleman for ''On the Twentieth Century'' (1978), based on the Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur play about a flamboyant movie producer (John Cullum) and his leading lady (Madeline Kahn), traveling from Hollywood to Broadway on the Twentieth-Century Limited in the 1930s. The show was a hit and brought them Tony Awards for their book and score.         In 1982 they wrote the book and lyrics -- Larry Grossman wrote the music -- for what was meant to be a kind of musical sequel to Ibsen's ''A Doll's House,'' but the result, ''A Doll's Life'' (1982), was a four-performance disaster.         Their last major Broadway show was ''The Will Rogers Follies,'' a 1991 Ziegfeld-style extravaganza with music by Mr. Coleman, book by Peter Stone and direction and choreography by Tommy Tune. Keith Carradine starred as the folksy humorist-philosopher. Despite mixed reviews the show won six Tony Awards, including one for the music and lyrics, and enjoyed a run of two and a half years.         By the time ''Will Rogers'' came along, Ms. Comden and Mr. Green had worked together for more than a half-century. On Broadway, starting with ''On the Town'' in 1944, they had won a shelf full of Tony Awards. They were among the recipients of the 1991 Kennedy Center honors for their contributions to American musical theater.         Their early Hollywood credits included ''Take Me Out to the Ball Game'' (1949), with Gene Kelly, Mr. Sinatra and Esther Williams, and ''It's Always Fair Weather'' (1955), with Mr. Kelly, Dan Dailey, Michael Kidd and Ms. Charisse, for which their screenplay received an Academy Award nomination. A bittersweet sequel of sorts to ''On the Town,'' the plot of ''It's Always Fair Weather'' revolved around the reunion a decade after World War II of three former G.I. companions who find that time has altered their friendship for the worse.         ''I don't think there's ever been a musical quite like it,'' Ms. Comden said in a 1999 interview with The Times. ''The corrosive effect that time has on friendships -- that's a very unusual subject for a musical.'' She and Mr. Green said it was one of their favorites.         After their stage debut in ''On the Town'' they didn't perform on Broadway again until 1958, when they appeared in ''A Party with Betty Comden and Adolph Green,'' a revue that included some of their early favorites like ''The Baroness Bazuka,'' which they described as a tribute to the Shubert brothers (''J. J., O. O., and Uh-Uh.''). The revue was well received, and they brought an updated version back to Broadway in 1977.         Ms. Comden also performed in films from time to time. She acted in Sidney Lumet's ''Garbo Talks'' (1984), in which Mr. Green also made a fleeting appearance, and James Ivory's ''Slaves of New York'' (1989). She appeared onstage in 1983 in a rare dramatic role in Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic,'' playing the mother of a footloose girl waiting for Mr. Right to come along.         In 1999 Ms. Comden and Mr. Green were saluted by their peers in a two-night program at Carnegie Hall. Elaine Stritch and Brian Stokes Mitchell were among the performers who sang numbers from the Comden-Green repertoire.         Recent Broadway revivals of their work included a 2001 production of ''Bells Are Ringing'' starring Faith Prince, which closed after a brief run, and the 2003 revival of ''Wonderful Town'' with Donna Murphy, which settled in for a long stay at the Al Hirschfeld Theater.         After Mr. Green's death in October 2002, Broadway turned out in force two months later for a memorial program at the Shubert Theater. Kevin Kline, Joel Grey, Ms. Bacall and others paid affectionate tribute to Mr. Green in song and story. At one point during her own reminiscence about him, Ms. Comden paused and said to the audience, ''It's lonely up here.'' After six decades the perfect relationship was over.         Correction:  February 26, 2007, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 24 about the Broadway lyricist Betty Comden misstated her given name at birth. Although the name Elizabeth is widely reported in reference works, she was named Basya Cohen and was never called Elizabeth, according to her memoir, ''Off Stage.'' (She chose the name Betty because Basya is pronounced Bahssie and she wanted to avoid the nickname for a cow, Bossy.) A reader pointed out the error in an e-mail message on Tuesday, and this correction was further delayed for research.       
         Galina Ustvolskaya, a Russian composer of expressive and often forceful works who studied with Shostakovich, and whose music has found an enthusiastic audience in the West since the early 1990s, died on Dec. 22 in St. Petersburg, Russia. She was 87.         Her death was announced online by International Music Publishers Hans Sikorski.         Ms. Ustvolskaya was an enigmatic and largely reclusive composer who produced a compact but rich body of music. Among her works are five symphonies (all with solo vocal writing), six piano sonatas, a piano concerto and numerous chamber works for unusual instrumental combinations. Her ''Dona Nobis Pacem,'' for example, is scored for piccolo, tuba and piano; a ''Dies Irae'' is for eight double basses, percussion and piano.         Galina Ivanovna Ustvolskaya was born in St. Petersburg (then called Petrograd) on June 17, 1919, and she studied composition there (when it was Leningrad) from 1937 to 1947. Shostakovich was among her teachers, and he regarded her as a supremely talented composer: in addition to declaring that her music would ''be valued by all who perceive truth in music to be of paramount importance,'' he quoted a theme from her 1949 Trio for Clarinet, Violin and Piano in two works of his own, the String Quartet No. 5 and the ''Immortality'' movement of his ''Suite on Verses of Michelangelo Buonarroti.''         But her relationship with Shostakovich was complex. Elizabeth Wilson, in ''Shostakovich: A Life Remembered,'' writes that from at least the late 1940s it was romantic as well as collegial, and that Shostakovich proposed marriage to Ms. Ustvolskaya in the 1950s, after his first wife died. She declined, and although they maintained what she once described as an on-and-off relationship thereafter, later in life Ms. Ustvolskaya vehemently rejected the notion of Shostakovich's influence on her.         Her stylistic hallmarks changed radically through the years: in the 1940s and 1950s she sometimes drew themes from Russian folk music, and, like Shostakovich, had both a public style, for concert works and film scores filled with the grand gestures that pleased the Soviet regime, and a more introspective private style in which she expressed herself more directly. The public works won her early official acclaim, including an All Union Prize for ''The Hero's Exploit'' (1959).         In the 1960s, though, she abandoned the public style entirely, and in the 1970s she became drawn to religious symbolism and biblical texts, though she is said not to have been particularly religious. Her language is essentially tonal, if acid-tinged, and full of appealingly angular themes. Yet there is also a fury in her music that finds expression in solid, dissonant chords that are usually sharply articulated and repeated several times to create a violently passionate effect. Elmer Schoenberger, a Dutch critic, called her ''the lady with the hammer.''         In 1995, Alex Ross wrote in The New York Times: ''Ms. Ustvolskaya is to be approached with caution. She may inspire admiration, or she may inspire frustration, even revulsion. Woe to the pleasure-seeking listener who spots certain religiose titles -- 'Dona Nobis Pacem,' 'Amen,' 'Dies Irae' -- and expects a Mystic Minimalist after the fashion of Henryk Gorecki or Arvo Pärt. This is religiosity with hard edges, penance for esoteric sin. Forms emerge from pitch-blackness only when the eyes have become accustomed to the lack of light.''
