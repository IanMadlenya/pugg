         Tanaquil Le Clercq, one of the greatest of American ballerinas, who was George Balanchine's ideal muse and Jerome Robbins's happiest inspiration at the New York City Ballet in the 1940's and 1950's, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 71 and had homes in Manhattan; Weston, Conn.; and Windermere, Fla.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the New York City Ballet said.         In a tragic end to her performing career, the still-young ballerina contracted paralytic polio in 1956 while she was at the peak of her powers. At the time she was also married to Balanchine, his fourth wife. Her luminously elegant style, the freshness of her long-legged wit and her mysterious dramatic perfume had attracted an adoring public. The dance world went into shock.         Yet although she remained paralyzed below the waist, Ms. Le Clercq became a teacher at Dance Theater of Harlem, wrote two books and frequently attended dance performances. In 1998, City Ballet opened its 50th-anniversary season with a tribute to her as a charter member of the company and to her legendary status within it. Ms. Le Clercq acknowledged a tumultuous ovation at the New York State Theater from her wheelchair as Peter Martins, the company's artistic director, presented her with a bouquet.         The tribute included films of her performances and interviews. Robbins, who cast her as the sensuous girl in his ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' summed up her range. ''Tanny,'' he said, ''could do anything.''         With an elongated physique that she used with refinement or humor (Balanchine once cast her as a dragonfly), she epitomized the modernized look in classical dancing that Balanchine was promoting in the United States in the 1940's. As the first City Ballet ballerina personally trained since childhood by Balanchine, she was naturally identified with his major works and the roles he created for her in them. These ballets included ''Symphonie Concertante,'' ''Symphony in C,'' ''Bourree Fantasque,'' ''Western Symphony'' and ''La Valse,'' in which her doomed heroine danced herself to death with chilling fervor.         Nonetheless, she was equally unforgettable in the Robbins ballets and as the stunning white-faced allegorical figure of Sacred Love wafted high above the ground by a male retinue in ''Illuminations,'' which the British choreographer Fredrick Ashton choreographed for City Ballet in 1950. In 1949, she was also willing to experiment in Merce Cunningham's works in Europe.         Ms. Le Clercq was one of those singular dancers whose dramatic projection and brilliant technique could appeal simultaneously to a broad audience and a cultlike following of artists and writers.         She was born in Paris on Oct. 2, 1929. Her mother, Edith Whittemore, was American, and her father, Jacques Le Clercq, was a French poet and writer. Their daughter was named after an Etruscan queen and was 3 when the family moved to New York.         At 7, Ms. Le Clercq began studying with Mikhail Mordkin, the former star of the Bolshoi Ballet. In October 1941, she won a scholarship competition at the School of American Ballet, founded in 1934 by Balanchine, Lincoln Kirstein and others. Ms. Le Clercq also attended the French Lycee and the King-Coit School.         Although Balanchine and Kirstein had no permanent ballet company at this time, Balanchine cast her in 1945 in a student performance of ''Symphonie Concertante,'' a ballet to Mozart. After Kirstein and Balanchine founded Ballet Society in 1946, the precursor to City Ballet, she recreated her role as the second ballerina opposite Maria Tallchief, whom Balanchine had married in 1946.         As a 15-year-old in 1944, Ms. Le Clercq had also appeared in ''Resurgence,'' a short piece Balanchine created for a benefit for the March of Dimes. Balanchine portrayed an evil character, Polio, who caused Ms. Le Clercq to look paralyzed.         Balanchine would later refer to the event as an omen of the polio attack suffered by Ms. Le Clercq while she and Balanchine were on tour with City Ballet in Copenhagen. Her misfortune affected many deeply. Robbins wrote her every day during the first year of her illness.         Balanchine returned to choreography in 1957. But even in 1959, B. H. Haggin, a critic who was especially devoted to the ballerina, wrote that for some spectators, there was ''an aching feeling of loss over the absence of Le Clercq from the works in which they had watched the development of her extraordinary powers as a dancer and as a stage personality.''         Particularly amazing was that Ms. Le Clercq affected so many in a professional career that lasted only 10 years. She was not the only dancer who served as a muse to Balanchine or with whom he had a relationship. After his first wife, Tamara Geva, left him, he lived with the ballerina Alexandra Danilova and subsequently married Vera Zorina and Ms. Tallchief. He married Ms. Le Clercq in 1952, and they were divorced in 1969. There are no immediate survivors.         Ms. Le Clercq created 32 roles for Ballet Society and City Ballet. She danced the dynamic ''Choleric'' variation in the 1946 premiere of Balanchine's ''Four Temperaments.'' In 1949 she appeared in two pieces by Merce Cunningham (''Games and Trio'' and ''Amores'') in a Paris studio.         Kirstein saw her as ''the epitome of Balanchine's lyrically athletic American criterion.'' Repeatedly, she combined French elegance with American energy, as was obvious in her dance-hall girl in ''Western Symphony,'' which Balanchine set to cowpoke tunes in 1954. Strutting on toe and her needle-sharp long legs, she exhibited flair and flounce; vulgarity was anathema to her dancing.         Her work was colored, above all, by a mysterious individuality. Others succeeded her in ''La Valse,'' a neo-romantic work by Balanchine to Ravel. But few could exemplify her pathos and fragility as she threw her head back and plunged a hand into a long black glove.         In some ballets, she was irreplaceable. In ''The Concert'' (1956), Robbins's big comic hit, she was a daffy heroine who struck a serious note with a long introspective solo. Robbins dropped the solo after Ms. Le Clercq stopped dancing.       
         Millicent Carey McIntosh, whose stewardship of the Brearley School and then Barnard College made her a national role model for generations of young women who wanted to combine career and family, died on Wednesday at her home in Tyringham, Mass. She was 102.         An outspoken feminist in the 1940's and 50's before feminism became popular, Mrs. McIntosh was the first married woman to head one of the seven top women's colleges known as the Seven Sisters and became a national icon.         ''She was a president who was ahead of her time,'' Judith Shapiro, Barnard's president, said at a gathering in 1998 at the McIntosh Student Center to mark Mrs. McIntosh's centennial birthday. She said Mrs. McIntosh, a campus legend, was a pioneer in exploring ''the struggle of both women and men to find their true roles in a changing world.''         Leora Hanser, Barnard student government president at the time of the celebration, said Mrs. McIntosh ''came from a different era, but the work and family issue is really very important, and a lot of Barnard students struggle with this today.''         In her long career, Mrs. McIntosh spoke and lectured widely, spreading ideas about women, education and child-rearing that would become popular 20 or 30 years later.         ''Having both a job and a family broadens one's perspective, which in turn makes a great contribution to a happy home life,'' she told the American Association of University Women in 1950.         She called for child care to be elevated to a dignified profession so working mothers could leave children in capable hands. And she attacked the conditioning that led young girls to feel they must subordinate their own interests when they were with boys, or to use the ''foolish technique'' of pretending they were stupid to be popular.         For anyone doubting that it could be done, Mrs. McIntosh was also the ultimate role model as she juggled marriage, five children (including twins) and her own career. Newsweek magazine viewed that as so remarkable that it put her on its cover in 1951.         But Mrs. McIntosh was less didactic than some later feminists. Even as she urged young women to participate in politics and community service and careers, she warned them that combining career and family meant pushing out nearly everything else. And she portrayed family life as a cornerstone of society and democracy, adding that in the face of conflict, family must take precedence.         ''You must be prepared to sacrifice many of your social contacts until your family is full grown,'' she said, ''and must always remember that your home comes before all else.''         She also respected the idea that happiness could come in many ways. Personal fulfillment ''may or may not lie in a career,'' she told The New York Herald Tribune in 1946. ''What is important is for each individual to order her life so that she becomes a happy, creative person.''         Her approach to life was rooted in common sense and a lack of pretense, physically and intellectually. A small, trim woman, she often wore plain suits without decoration. As a college president, she swept her own vestibule and weeded her own garden. And when she was honored after 10 years as chief of Barnard, she agreed on the condition that there be no speeches, no gifts and no flowers.         She also disliked honorifics. She preferred ''Mrs.'' to Dean and was often referred to as ''Mrs. Mac.'' When Barnard officials referred to her in news releases as ''Dr.,'' she chided them, saying, ''There is only one doctor in our family,'' referring to her husband, Dr. Rustin McIntosh, a pediatrician who taught at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.         Mrs. McIntosh saw education in its broadest sense, from conjugating irregular Greek verbs to sex education, as the way to prepare young women for the complicated balancing act she was urging on them. She believed that the education of young women for motherhood was society's ''most important task.''         At a time when few women were represented in the boardrooms of major American corporations, Mrs. McIntosh was a director of several companies, schools, foundations and civic groups.         After her retirement in 1962, she and her husband moved to their farm in Tyringham, Mass. Her husband died in 1986. Mrs. McIntosh is survived by a daughter, Susan Lloyd of Tinmouth, Vt.; 4 sons, James, of Ann Arbor, Mich., R. Carey, of Tyringham, Kenneth of West Newton, Mass., and J. Richard, of Boulder, Colo.; 10 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.         Millicent Carey McIntosh was born on Nov. 30, 1898, in Baltimore, the daughter of Anthony Morris Carey, who ran a machinery supply business, and the former Margaret Cheston Thomas, both active Quakers. She had five brothers and sisters, and all were taught to mend and darn and market and cook.         Her feminist notions were shaped by strong role models in her family. Her mother fought for women's suffrage, racial equality and prison reform. Her aunt, M. Carey Thomas, was a pioneer in women's education, a founder of the Bryn Mawr School (a girls' school in Baltimore) and president of Bryn Mawr College.         At Bryn Mawr, young Millicent played water polo and basketball and majored in Greek and English, graduating magna cum laude. She organized clubs for factory workers before accepting her aunt's offer of a year of study abroad.         After studying economics at Cambridge and English at Johns Hopkins University (where she did her doctoral thesis on 14th-century English mystery dramas), Mrs. McIntosh became an instructor at Bryn Mawr College. But she quickly was appointed dean of freshmen and then acting dean of the college.         She left Bryn Mawr to became headmistress at the Brearley School, the private girls school in Manhattan, from 1930 to 1947, and converted it from a half-day format to a full day. When she arrived, she asked her students to help plan the ''ideal school'' with the fewest possible rules. She worked without a desk because she felt that a desk intimated students. She introduced aptitude tests and remedial instruction and instituted a sex education course for sixth graders, which she taught.         In 1932, after she married Dr. McIntosh, her aunt discouraged her retirement, telling her, ''You can have your babies in August.'' At Brearley, she had five children. (She took to wearing academic robes to cover pregnancies.)         She was a hands-on manager, both at school and at home. She left detailed instructions for her household: menus, shopping lists, activities for the children. And every morning, she called Brearley to specify a hymn for morning assembly.         In late 1946, before Barnard had its own president (she was given the title in 1952), Mrs. McIntosh was chosen from more than 60 candidates to succeed Virginia Gildersleeve as Barnard's dean. It was a life that left few free minutes, but Mrs. McIntosh grabbed every one. She signed correspondence during intermissions at concerts and took her secretary with her to the beauty parlor so she could give dictation.         An administrator who valued good teaching, Mrs. McIntosh was dismayed that teachers were paid less than secretaries and dedicated some of Barnard's endowment for faculty salaries.         She also valued merit, and directed another part of the Barnard endowment to scholarships to open Barnard's doors to ''still more girls of superior talent regardless of their ability to pay.''         As she balanced career and home, Mrs. McIntosh acknowledged both her husband's support and good household help (which at one point included a governess, a cook and two daily helpers). She also respected the individuality of her children, keeping each in a separate school until one year, after attending five separate Christmas pageants, she said, ''I thought if I heard one more 'Silent Night' I would break down.'' Their schooling was consolidated.         At Barnard, she continued to teach: English and modern living, a required class that sought to help students think through their lives. She also presided over a $10 million fund-raising campaign.         John D. Rockefeller Jr., who rarely contributed to development funds, agreed to give Barnard $1 million, he told Mrs. McIntosh, ''because of my confidence in the exceptional vision and leadership you are bringing to the college.''         Even after she retired from Barnard, the trustees continued to consult her. In 1971, when men's and women's colleges everywhere were going coeducational and Barnard was facing pressure to merge into Columbia, Barnard's chairwoman, Eleanor Elliott, turned to Mrs. McIntosh, who suggested that the trustees try to answer three questions: Would a merger produce better education for Barnard and Columbia? Would relations between Barnard women and Columbia men be improved? And would a merger create economies for both colleges?         ''Mrs. Mac's questions helped organize our thinking simply and calmly,'' Mrs. Elliott said in an interview, ''and of course, we felt stronger.''       
         Vera Constantinova, a princess of Russia long active in Russian-American emigre circles and charitable organizations, died on Jan. 11 at the Tolstoy Foundation Center in Valley Cottage, N.Y. She was 94.         Princess Vera was born near St. Petersburg, a daughter of Grand Duke Constantine and Princess Elisabeth of Saxe-Altenburg. She was a great-granddaughter of Nicholas I, czar from 1825 to 1855.         Many of her relatives were killed by the Bolsheviks in 1918, but she and her mother escaped to Sweden. Eventually they settled in Altenburg, seat of the duchy of Saxe-Altenburg, in Thuringia, eastern Germany.         At the end of World War II, Princess Vera fled again before the advancing Soviet Army. She came to the United States in 1951 to live in New York and work for organizations like the Tolstoy Foundation, which was formed to help Russian refugees.         Princess Vera never married.       
         Dr. Dorothy M. Horstmann, an epidemiologist, virologist, polio pioneer and the first woman appointed as a professor at the Yale School of Medicine, died on Jan. 11 in New Haven. She was 89.         She had Alzheimer's disease, said Dr. I. George Miller, a colleague and professor of virology at Yale.         Dr. Horstmann died as the World Health Organization was on the verge of eradicating polio and four days after the death of Dr. Joseph L. Melnick of Houston, another polio pioneer with whom she worked and wrote scholarly papers.         Dr. Horstmann made significant scientific, educational and public health contributions, and her major scientific achievement was showing that the polio virus reached the brain by way of the blood, a finding that upset dogma and helped make polio vaccines possible.         ''The widely held feeling that the virus grew solely in nerve cells had to be set aside,'' said Dr. John F. Enders, who won a Nobel Prize for developing a technique that allowed the polio virus to be grown in cells.         At the time, scientists believed that the polio virus directly attacked the nervous system because efforts to isolate the virus from the blood of paralyzed patients had failed. The reason they failed became apparent when Dr. Horstmann's team detected the polio virus in the blood of infected monkeys and chimpanzees before signs of paralysis appeared. They found that by the time paralysis developed, antibodies had eliminated the polio virus from the blood.         At Dr. Horstmann's 70th birthday party, Dr. Enders said that ''obviously, the disease behaved like many viral infections'' and that ''everyone was relieved to find that poliomyelitis was not an exceptionally bizarre disease, but similar to others.''         Dr. Horstmann's work contributed to the licensing of an oral polio vaccine developed by Dr. Albert B. Sabin from live, weakened virus. The vaccine was tested among millions of people in what was then the Soviet Union. But in 1959, Western scientists were skeptical about the favorable findings reported by Russian, Polish and Czech health workers.         The World Health Organization then asked Dr. Horstmann to study the incidence of polio in the vaccinated areas. She guardedly concluded that the findings were reliable and that the Sabin vaccine was safe and effective. The United States and other countries then licensed it.         Dorothy Millicent Horstmann was born in Spokane, Wash., on July 2, 1911. She earned her undergraduate degree from the University of California at Berkeley and her medical degree in 1940 from the University of California at San Francisco.         It was a time when doctors were first using sulfa drugs to cure pneumonia. Dr. Horstmann said that the combination of that drug advance, lectures by the renowned microbiologist Dr. Karl F. Meyer and her experience with patients during her internship and residency at San Francisco County Hospital piqued her interest in infectious diseases.         Dr. Horstmann spent an additional year training at Vanderbilt University in Nashville and, in 1942, she went to Yale to perform research under Dr. John R. Paul for a year before becoming a specialist in internal medicine. During a polio epidemic in New Haven in 1943, Dr. Horstmann pitched in. She joined the Yale poliomyelitis unit, and soon decided to devote her career to various aspects of infectious agents.         Dr. Horstmann became a pediatrician at midcareer. In 1961 she received her professorship at Yale, and in 1969 she became the first woman to receive an endowed chair there. It was in epidemiology and pediatrics and named for her mentor, Dr. Paul.         She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences and was the president of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.         Dr. Horstmann is survived by a nephew, Paul Rooney, of Ashland, Ore.       
         The last queen of Italy, Maria José of Savoy, who served after World War II for only 27 days before Italians voted to abolish the monarchy, died on Saturday in a Geneva hospital. She was 94.         The daughter of Albert I, king of Belgium, Maria José in 1930 married Prince Umberto II, whose father, King Vittorio Emanuele III, cooperated with Mussolini before and during World War II.         Maria José was a little less pliant to the Fascist dictatorship, refusing to Italianize her name to Maria Giuseppina even after Mussolini made it a rule. Italians, who called her the ''rebel queen,'' described her as a closet anti-Fascist. When she fled Rome for Switzerland after Mussolini's fall in 1943, she reportedly told friends that she regretted not having joined Italian Partisans who fought to oust the Germans.         After the war, Maria José became queen on May 9, 1946, when Vittorio Emanuele abdicated in favor of his son, hoping that the gesture would keep the monarchy alive. It did not.  Italians could not forgive the royal family for its early support of Mussolini or for fleeing Rome in 1943 when he was overthrown and Italy changed sides and declared war on Germany.         Two years after a referendum that abolished the monarchy, Italy passed a law banning all male members of the Savoy family from setting foot in Italy. It is still in force, despite lobbying and legal challenges by Maria José's oldest son, Vittorio Emanuele, and her grandson, Emanuele Filiberto, the current heir to the throne.         Umberto and Maria José moved to Portugal even before the results of the referendum were made known, and she left her husband after a year and set up home in an 18th-century villa near Geneva, where members of the ousted dynasty spent their exile. Umberto died in 1983.         She will be buried next to her husband in Hauntecombe Abbey, in France, where many rulers of the Savoy dynasty are interred.       
         Frieda Pushnik, who used being born without limbs to achieve a remunerative career, not to mention a quirky celebrity, by appearing in Ripley's and Barnum's sideshows as the ''Armless and Legless Wonder,'' died of bladder cancer on Dec. 24 at her home in Costa Mesa, Calif. She was 77.         ''At least they didn't call me brainless,'' she said with the wit that -- when combined with demonstrations of skills including writing, typing and sewing -- carried her sideshow performances beyond peculiarity to a lesson in adaptation and determination.         When asked in a CBS television interview in 1998 whether she thought it was all right to be stared at, she snapped back, ''If you're paid for it, yeah.''         And she was paid, and then some. Sideshows in the middle years of the last century were popular, and by far their best-paid performers were people with intriguing deformities.         ''She was fabulously in the right place at the right time,'' said James Taylor, publisher of the magazine Shocked and Amazed, which is devoted to sideshows.         But Miss Pushnik also personified what Dick Zigun, the impresario of the sideshow tribute Coney Island U.S.A., calls ''the hot-button issue of sideshows,'' the showcasing of people with physical abnormalities. Mr. Zigun's show at Coney Island features what are known as working acts, meaning normal-seeming people who have learned to do freakish things. One of his stars, for instance, drives a nail through his tongue.         But Mr. Zigun defends displaying those who are known in the sideshow business as freaks. ''What's the alternative?'' he asked. ''To have a politically correct society where people would be hidden away, living on welfare?''         Robert Bogdan, a sociologist at Syracuse University who wrote the 1998 book ''Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit,'' said that Miss Pushnik came along during the transition between the old it's-all-right-to-stare attitude and a newer view that people with deformities should be looked at, if at all, as medical case studies.         ''She and her mother conducted themselves in a dignified way at a time questions about this as a proper practice were beginning to be raised,'' Mr. Bogdan said in an interview.         Frieda Katherine Pushnik was born on Feb. 10, 1923, in Conemaugh, Pa. Her brother William, her only survivor, said her condition resulted from a botched appendectomy on her pregnant mother, which severed her arms and legs while she was in the womb. He said the family never considered suing for malpractice, but from the perspective of this more litigious time, speculated on what a successful suit might have meant.         For one thing, Mr. Pushnik said, the poor family might have afforded a wheelchair instead of putting wobbly wheels on a high chair. For another, Frieda could have had a more normal childhood. ''She would never have had to go to the World's Fair or anything like that,'' Mr. Pushnik said.         But he said that Frieda never talked about her limblessness, even as a young girl. ''She accepted it as a matter of fact,'' he said.         In a 1966 interview, Miss Pushnik told The Orange County Register that she had never resented her condition. ''I never said, 'Why me?' That would be a wasted emotion. You can ruin your life like that,'' she said.         From the beginning, her mother insisted she do as much as possible for herself. By holding things between one small stump of an arm and her chin, she could feed herself, sew and crochet. Her brother remembers her going sledding, and laughing uproariously when she fell off. She also received an award for penmanship.         In 1933, Robert L. Ripley, creator of ''Ripley's Believe It or Not!,'' heard of her and visited. He put a cartoon of her in his nationally syndicated feature, calling her ''little half girl'' and misspelling her name as Freda. He then asked her to appear at the World's Fair in Chicago in 1933.         With her mother and sister accompanying her, as they did throughout her performing career, the 9-year-old girl joined a man who lifted weights with his eyelids and a 4-year-old girl with four legs and three arms in what Mr. Ripley had named his Odditorium.         In the 1996 interview, she described her opening spiel. ''I'd say, 'I'm Frieda Pushnik, I'm 9 years old and I attend public school,' '' she said. ''Then I'd do a demonstration -- how I'd type and write and sew.''         She repeated the five-minute show many times each hour through what was often a 16-hour day, with her mother hovering nearby. In six years of touring most of the nation's major expositions, including the New York World's Fair in 1939, she was seen by millions.         ''She was a big attraction,'' said Edward Meyer, archivist at the Ripley headquarters in Orlando. ''Well known, well photographed, made major appearances, as opposed to hicky little fairs.''         Then the mother and daughter returned home to Pennsylvania, but they soon received a call from the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus. She joined the circus's sideshow, which was in a tent pitched near the big tent's entrance and cost extra. Other attractions included giants, midgets, Siamese twins and a tattooed man who had decorated even the inside of his ears.         ''I was a star,'' Miss Pushnik said of her circus years, which lasted from 1943 to 1955 with a two-year break in the early 1950's.         In 1944, when the Big Top caught fire in Hartford, killing 167 people, a performer in the circus's minstrel show rushed on stage, grabbed her chair and carried her to safety.         In the early 1960's, she, her mother, her sister and her brother-in-law decided to move to Orange County, Calif., where Mr. Pushnik had settled. Miss Pushnik never talked in detail about money, saying only that she ''managed.'' But her tasteful furnishings reflected her success in saving and investing her sideshow income. She liked to cruise the South Coast Plaza mall in her Jaguar, as she named her wheelchair in honor of its fake jaguar-skin upholstery.         She decorated her house with her own oil paintings, and she enjoyed entertaining. Guests who had earlier expressed interest in watching her eat would realize only after she was finished that she had been so natural they failed to notice how she did it, her brother said.         The truth seems to be that she would have been pleased to discuss just about anything. ''What are they going to learn if they just stare?'' she once asked. ''They should come ask me.''       
         Kate Born Schaeffer, a longtime partner with her husband at Schaeffer Galleries in Manhattan, which became known for selling art by old masters to museums and collectors, died on Dec. 20 at her home in Manhattan. She was 102.         For three decades Mrs. Schaeffer and her husband, Dr. Hanns Schaeffer, ran the New York Schaeffer Galleries, which was founded in 1936 and has been at 983 Park Avenue in Manhattan for more than 50 years. They also contributed some artworks to museums.         Dr. Schaeffer died in the early 1960's and Mrs. Schaeffer became the owner and president of Schaeffer Galleries until her death. Schaeffer Galleries is now owned and directed by the Schaeffers' daughter, Cornelia Bessie, who had been its vice president.         James J. Rorimer, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art from 1955 to 1967, observed in 1961: ''The Schaeffers are among the most serious, knowledgeable and helpful art dealers who are enabling American museums to grow for the benefit of our public. They are friends who share unstintingly in helping curators, directors and trustees to choose with care the works of art which redound to the credit of their museums.''         The paintings and drawings that passed through the Schaeffers' hands included, among many others, Botticelli's ''Madonna and Child with Singing Angels,'' now held by the Staatliche Museen in Berlin; a Cranach in the William Rockhill Nelson Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo.; Correggio's ''Salvator Mundi'' in the National Gallery of Art in Washington; Rubens's ''Cleopatra'' at the Detroit Institute of Arts; a Frans Hals at the Mauritshuis in The Hague; numerous Rembrandts, including ''Young Man With a Sword'' in the North Carolina Museum of Art in Raleigh; and da Vinci's ''Bear Walking'' and a Jean-Antoine Watteau, both at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Gilbert S. Edelson, the administrative vice president of the Art Dealers Association of America, which is based in Manhattan, said the Schaeffers ''were knowledgeable, they were articulate, they had all the qualities that make truly distinguished dealers.''         Mrs. Schaeffer, whose maiden name was Born, was born in Germany and studied singing in various European capitals. She was a lieder and opera singer in Germany for a few years before she married Dr. Schaeffer, who was also born in Germany, not long after World War I ended. Later, gallery work became her main activity.         Her husband opened an art gallery in 1921 in Berlin and later operated galleries in London and San Francisco. Those galleries were also each named Schaeffer Galleries. All had closed before Schaeffer Galleries in Manhattan was founded, after the Schaeffers had moved to the United States permanently.         Mrs. Schaeffer is survived by her daughter, Cornelia Bessie of Lyme, Conn.       
         Helen Coley Nauts, who devoted her life to championing the once-neglected cancer-treatment discoveries of her father and founded a cancer institute, died at home last Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 93.         Mrs. Nauts was the daughter of Dr. William B. Coley, a surgeon and cancer specialist who, trying to help seriously ill patients for whom he had been able to do nothing, hit on the idea of injecting them with a mixture of live bacteria. The goal was to goad the body into producing its own defenses against cancer.         Dr. Coley, who practiced at what became the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, recorded many cures with bacteria injection, but his successes were not easily replicated and could not be explained. The method came to be dismissed by much of the medical establishment as unproven, even quackery, and was eventually overshadowed by radiation and chemotherapy.         After her father died in 1936, Mrs. Nauts, who was at home raising two daughters, decided to go through his papers to write his biography. As she did, she came across many records of seriously ill cancer patients who, after being injected with what are still referred to as ''Coley's toxins,'' appeared to have recovered.         Convinced that medicine was overlooking a powerful tool -- and, perhaps more important, her associates say, incensed at the aspersions the medical establishment had cast on her father and his work -- Mrs. Nauts embarked on a crusade. In 1953, she established the Cancer Research Institute, which now has an annual budget of $14 million and provides support for scientists around the world. She eventually succeeded in returning her father's work to the attention of oncologists.         ''She was inflamed,'' said Dr. Lloyd J. Old, an immunotherapy expert at Sloan-Kettering and a longtime friend. ''She was absolutely inflamed by a grand idea.''         Dr. Coley is now often described as the founder of modern immunotherapy, a major cancer treatment. Although Coley's toxins are rarely used, his discoveries of the late 19th century are credited with helping researchers develop more modern therapies. And Mrs. Nauts has received many awards for her work.         The theory that the body's defenses can be brought to bear in the fight against disease was not new when William Coley began putting them into practice. The concept dates to antiquity. But Dr. Coley was one of the first to use bacteria to fight cancer systematically and, at least by the medical standards of his day, methodically.         He got the idea after learning of a cancer patient with a sometimes fatal skin infection, not uncommon among surgery patients then. The patient survived the infection but his cancer had fared less well; it seemed to have disappeared. After finding similar cases in the records, Dr. Coley set out to develop a cancer vaccine made from bacteria.         Despite his successes and initially positive reactions from colleagues, Dr. Coley was never able to win broad support for his treatment and, according to a 1984 article in Science magazine, died a disappointed man.         Helen Lancaster Coley, his daughter with his wife, the former Alice Lancaster, was born Sept. 2, 1907, in Sharon, Conn., and was raised in New York City. She attended the Brearley School in Manhattan and Miss Porter's in Farmington, Conn., then studied landscape architecture for a time at Columbia. But she came from a milieu and a time in which she was not expected to pursue a career. Her husband, William Boone Nauts, who died about a decade ago, was a banker, and Mrs. Nauts raised her children, did volunteer work and some landscape design.         All that changed after her father's death, when she began poring over 15,000 letters and other records stored in a barn in Sharon. Dr. Coley had been a clinician, not a researcher, and the task of giving order to the papers was monumental.         About two years later, Mrs. Nauts went to the medical director of Dr. Coley's hospital and said she thought that her father's work deserved reappraisal. Her best course of action, she was told, was to put together 100 or so case histories; she eventually produced 1,000, along the way educating herself about cancer. She was so precise that cancer researchers today still examine the monographs she published for clues about the disease, Dr. Old said.         In an interview with Science, Mrs. Nauts described a meeting with a Mount Sinai Hospital bacteriologist, Dr. Gregory Shwartzman, with whom her father had corresponded.         ''I had read Shwartzman's book on the reaction of tumors to bacteria, and had prepared 13 pages of questions based on it,'' Mrs. Nauts recalled. ''During the interview, I took 80 pages of notes. Shwartzman couldn't believe anyone could be that thorough. But because I had no medical education, I had to be that way.''         In the years that followed, Mrs. Nauts wrote thousands of letters to doctors and patients who had used her husband's methods, seeking specifics about their cases. Her efforts were not always welcomed by the medical establishment.         ''At times the response to her could be described as vitriolic,'' said Dr. Alan M. Houghton, chairman of immunotherapy at Sloan-Kettering. But Mrs. Nauts was unyielding, and as the field of immunotherapy grew, researchers recognized the value of Dr. Coley's once-ignored work.         Even some admirers say she may have lost perspective at times. And family members -- Mrs. Nauts is survived by two daughters, Phyllis Lancaster Nauts of Cornwall, Conn., and New York, and Nancy Nauts Dobbs of the British Virgin Islands and Bali, Indonesia -- said her crusade could be hard on her family.         ''We felt she spent much too much time,'' Mrs. Dobbs said. ''I remember once saying to her, 'Mommy, let's play.' And she said, 'I can't play, because people are dying when I'm not working.' ''       
         Dr. Alexandra Adler, a New York neurologist and psychiatrist who carried on the tradition of her father, Alfred Adler, one of the pioneers of psychoanalytic theory, died Jan. 4 at New York University Hospital. She was 99 and lived in Manhattan.         A native of Vienna, she was among the earliest women to practice as a neurologist there and then in the United States. Her work on brain damage and alexia, the loss of the ability to read because of brain lesions, was often cited by others in the field.         She also wrote papers on psychological subjects ranging from alcoholism to juvenile delinquency. She was among the first to write detailed papers on post-traumatic stress syndrome, reflecting her studies of the surviving victims of the Coconut Grove nightclub fire in Boston in 1942, one of the nation's worst fire disasters.         Besides killing more than 490 people, the blaze left others with permanent brain damage. Dr. Adler studied the anxiety and depression that can follow such catastrophes and later applied her findings to the treatment World War II veterans.         Dr. Adler interpreted Adlerian theories in a book first published in 1938, ''Guiding Human Misfits: A Practical Application of Individual Psychology.'' It went through several editions in the United States and was republished in Germany in 1990.         Dr. Adler received her medical degree in Vienna, where she trained and practiced at the neuropsychiatric clinic of the University of Vienna. At the time, she also started editing the International Journal of Individual Psychology, the branch of psychology her father pioneered after he broke with Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalytical emphasis on sex as the root of neurosis.         She came to this country in 1935 to teach and practice at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. She joined the N.Y.U. faculty in 1946 and became a full professor of psychiatry at the its medical school in 1969.         An expert in schizophrenia, she worked at the New York City Department of Correction for 20 years with female offenders and was medical director of the Alfred Adler Mental Hygiene Clinic in Manhattan. She continued to see some patients at her private practice until a few years ago.         She contributed entries to national and international reference works.         In 1959, Dr. Adler married Dr. Halfdan Gregersen, a former dean and professor of Romance languages at Williams College. He died in 1980, and there are no immediate survivors.       
         G. E. M. Anscombe, a British moral and analytic philosopher as well as one of Wittgenstein's literary executors, died on Jan. 5 in Cambridge, England. She was 81 and had chronic heart disease, said her husband, Peter Geach.         Gertrude Elizabeth Margaret Anscombe -- known by her initials or as Elizabeth -- was a dry, fresh and formidable thinker, one of the foremost philosophers of mind, language, ethics and action. She fused Wittgenstein's philosophy of language and Aristotle's philosophy of ethics, framing an original theory of action.         Her work was tightly linked with Wittgenstein's. She was Wittgenstein's student and friend during World War II.         In 1951, when Wittgenstein died, Miss Anscombe, along with Wittgenstein's two other executors, Rush Rhees and G.H. von Wright, began the task of getting his work into print. (''Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus,'' which came out in 1921, was Wittgenstein's only book published in his lifetime.)         Miss Anscombe translated Wittgenstein's ''Philosophical Investigations'' from German into English, and had it published in 1953. Her translation of his work called ''Remarks on the Foundations of Mathematics'' came out in 1956. With Mr. von Wright, she assembled little bits of Wittgenstein's writings that had been cut up and stuffed in a box, and published them under the title ''Zettel'' (''Snippets'') in 1967.         Miss Anscombe and Mr. von Wright also put together ''Notebooks, 1914-1916.'' Editions of Wittgenstein's ''On Certainty,'' ''Remarks on Colour'' and ''Remarks on the Philosophy of Psychology'' followed.         In 1959, Miss Anscombe wrote ''An Introduction to Wittgenstein's ''Tractatus,'' which traced his work to Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell. The book is viewed as a classic by philosophers.         A. J. Ayer, in his book ''Wittgenstein,'' wrote, ''I can think of no one but Elizabeth Anscombe who has made an original contribution to philosophy on the basis of Wittgenstein's teaching.'' In 1980, Miss Anscombe even inherited Wittgenstein's former position, the chair of philosophy at Cambridge University.         Wittgenstein was not her sole influence. She also wrote about Plato. And in the field of ethics, Miss Anscombe looked especially to Aristotle. Like Aristotle, she believed that ethics must be tied to the idea of what it means to flourish as a human being. Mr. Geach, her husband and sometime collaborator, a professor of philosophy at the University of Birmingham and University of Leeds, put it this way: ''She thought that a theory of ethics without a theory of mind was bound to be bogus.''         In 1957 she wrote ''Intention,'' a blend of Aristotle's and Wittgenstein's philosophy, linking ethical ideas and behavior to a theory of intention and action. The philosopher Donald Davidson recently called the work ''the most important treatment of action since Aristotle.'' Her husband said that may have been an overstatement.         The next year she wrote an influential essay on morality, ''Modern Moral Philosophy,'' which was later published in her three-volume ''Collected Philosophical Papers'' (1981). In that essay, as Cora Diamond, a professor at the University of Virginia, explained, Miss Anscombe argued that the concepts of moral obligation and moral beauty were legalistic and should be abandoned. Right and wrong actions, Miss Anscombe said, cannot be determined by their consequences but rather are absolutes. She recommended Aristotle's concept of virtue instead.         In 1940, Miss Anscombe converted to Catholicism, and many of her writings reflected her moral and religious stance. In a 1939 pamphlet, ''The Justice of the Present War Examined,'' she had argued that Britain was entering an unjust war.         In ''Mr. Truman's Degree,'' she fought Oxford's decision to give an honorary degree to Harry S. Truman, accusing him of murdering innocents in the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki.         She condemned contraception in a pamphlet called ''Contraception and Chastity'' (1975), saying ''you might as well accept any sexual goings-on, if you accept contraceptive intercourse.''         In 1957, in an anti-Cartesian paper called ''The First Person,'' she said that ''I'' does not refer to anything.  And in 1985 she resurrected St. Anselm's 900-year-old argument for the existence of God.         G. E. M. Anscombe was born March 18, 1919, the daughter of Allen Wells Anscombe and Gertrude Elizabeth Thomas Anscombe. One of her two brothers was killed in the war. His twin, Thomas, survives Miss Anscombe. She was educated at Sydenham School and St. Hugh's College, Oxford.         At Newnham College, Cambridge, she was a research student from 1941 to 1944. That was where she first met Wittgenstein. She taught at Somerville College, Oxford, from 1946 to 1970. From 1970 to 1986, she was a professor of philosophy at Cambridge. She became a fellow of the British Academy in 1967 and an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.         Miss Anscombe and her husband were a well-known philosophical duo. They met while studying Catholic doctrine at Blackfriars College, Oxford. They were married in 1941 and had seven children, all of whom survive her: three sons (John, Charles and More) and four daughters (Barbara, Mary, Jennifer and Tamsin). Miss Anscombe and Mr. Geach also produced a book together, ''Three Philosophers''; he wrote on Aquinas and Frege, she on Aristotle.         Miss Anscombe, who did not like to be called Mrs. Geach, smoked cigars, wore trousers when they were considered improper for women and was said sometimes to eat beans from a tin can while lecturing.         Her philosophy was bold and noncomplacent too. In the Times Literary Supplement, the critic Mary Tiles wrote, ''Anscombe's willingness to question what many have taken for granted . . . can induce a feeling of intellectual disorientation.''       
         Betty Kenward, who exhaustively and uncritically chronicled the lives of England's upper classes at their dinners, balls, race meetings and country weekends in the pages of London's toniest magazines, died last Wednesday in London. She was 94.         A snob and proud of it, Mrs. Kenward composed numbingly undramatic accounts of parties, with long lists of names preceded by unfailingly complimentary adjectives and with their relative importance encoded for her privileged readership by idiosyncratic punctuation. Ordinary guests' names were set off from one another by mere commas. But Royal Family members and others of note rated semicolons. Many of the breathless serial sentences ended with exclamation marks.         In a career that ended in 1991, she reported on the doings of society at a time when cigarettes and wine glasses were airbrushed out of photographs, and there was never a mention of someone arriving with a surprise consort. People from business and publishing and advertising and popular culture may have been starting to mix in society late in her career, but they never made it into ''Jennifer's Diary,'' where the exclusivity of prewar family background was remorselessly maintained.         Attentive readers of the long-running column learned to divine judgments in the bland copy. A remark on the ''tirelessness'' of a hostess rather than her ''radiance'' meant that the night was probably a disaster. If a debutante was ''pretty'' instead of ''exquisite,'' then she was very likely ugly or badly turned out. The only way Mrs. Kenward registered utter disapproval was by omission.         She was wary of people who paraded by too often in search of a mention, and she made sure they did not receive one. When a young society photographer, Antony Armstrong-Jones, approached at a function, she said, ''My photographers never speak to me at parties.'' A year later, he married Princess Margaret and became Lord Snowdon, but Mrs. Kenward was still unforgiving. Diary items about the royal couple identified them simply as ''HRH Princess Margaret and her husband.''         Mrs. Kenward became a fixture in London society as much as for her decorous look as for what she wrote in ''Jennifer's Diary.'' She favored pink taffeta ball dresses and always wore a geishalike facial mask of powder with deep mascara, heavily penciled eyebrows and a four-strand pearl choker. Her lacquered champagne-blond bouffant hairdo was held in place by a color-coordinated velvet bow across the back. She strode through life with a purposeful posture, and her sweeping ballroom entrances were often met by swarms of tuxedoed men greeting her.         She never claimed to be a journalist, partly out of a desire not to seem pretentious and partly out of her conviction that most journalists were vulgar. She called gossip columnists ''gutter rats.'' Mrs. Kenward carried no pad and took no notes, but earned the grudging respect of newsroom professionals with her ability to remember perfectly what she had seen and by her insistence on accuracy.         If she drove proofreaders to distraction, she was hardest of all on her assistants, young women of good breeding whom she called secretaries. She forbade them to smoke, insisted that they use fountain pens instead of ballpoints and hectored them for having dirty hair or being overweight or receiving too many personal calls.         '' 'You look a perfect fright,' she'd snap, and they'd weep in the loos all lunchtime,'' Vicki Woods, her last editor at Harpers & Queen, told The Sunday Telegraph. None lasted more than four months. When one dared to cover an event herself, a replacement was sought with an advertisement that required ''no, repeat no, ambitions to write.''         Her routine was to have her chauffeur drive her from her Mayfair apartment to the Harpers & Queen office, where she met briefly with two assistants in her curtained-off work space piled high with invitations and calling cards and then go to lunch at Claridge's. She returned in the afternoon to file her copy from the previous night, evenings that typically included a reception, two cocktail parties and a formal dinner.         She was born Elizabeth Kemp-Welch on July 14, 1906, the daughter of Brian and Verena Kemp-Welch, a couple who spent much of their marriage living apart and conducting indiscreet romances. The situation led to an early experience of being a social outcast that might have influenced the daughter's subsequent attention to class preferences and enforced ignorance of extramarital affairs. Mrs. Kenward later said of her mother, ''She was very pretty but very immoral.''         Mrs. Kenward married Capt. Peter Kenward, a cavalry officer who worked in his family brewery business, in 1932 and was divorced from him 10 years later. She raised their son Jim, paying for his secondary school education at Winchester by pawning jewelry and working in a munitions factory, as a house matron at Eton and on the inquiries desk at British Vogue. Jim Kenward became an accountant and moved to Canada.         In World War II, she began writing a column for Tatler, ''On and Off Duty in Town and Country.'' With peace, the column was retitled ''Jennifer's Diary,'' because an editor said her refined looks suited the name Jennifer. Mrs. Kenward stayed there until 1959, when she switched to Queen and, in 1970, to its successor, Harpers & Queen.         When she closed out her career, she had never taken a sick day. The Independent reported that, describing her life in 1995, she said, ''In spite of having a cataract in both eyes, a hearing aid in both ears, a leaking heart valve and coronary arteries, which means taking 19 pills a day, I'm still having a go.''       
         Arlene Eisenberg, who with her two daughters wrote ''What to Expect When You're Expecting,'' which became known as the pregnancy bible, died on Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         From girlhood, when she repeatedly read Dr. Benjamin Spock's ''Baby and Child Care'' to qualify for a Girl Scout child care merit badge, to grandmotherhood, when she led the weekly new mothers' group at Ansche Chesed Temple on the Upper West Side, she seemed the perfect mother, but her mission was to tell mothers that they did not have to be perfect.         ''She was my mother, but I lent her out a lot,'' said her daughter Heidi E. Murkoff. ''She was sort of foster mother to the world.''         ''What to Expect When You're Expecting,'' the team's first book in a best-selling series on what to expect from pregnancy, babies and toddlers, was released by the Workman Publishing Company in 1984. Sales were modest at first, but it inexorably climbed to the best-seller list six years later. Without extensive advertising, demand grew by what the authors called ''word of mother,'' with sales now totaling 9.6 million copies in 31 languages.         ''It was quietly marvelous, sort of like Mozart,'' said Peter Workman,  the publishing house president, of the book's success.         In 1999, Good Housekeeping magazine reported that a survey showed that 93 percent of expectant or nursing mothers who had read any book about pregnancy had read it.         Now as common as bibs at baby showers, the book provided common-sense answers to the questions of mothers-to-be. Topics range from diet to delivery to postpartum depression and are arranged by month of pregnancy.         The authors used a question-and-answer format to deal with things people might be shy about asking their doctor, like whether the fetus is aware that the parents are having sex. (No.)         Mrs. Eisenberg said the book responded to a fragmented society in which people often live far from relatives who could reassure them about pregnancy.         ''It used to be you could get all the good information about raising your kids from your mother,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1999. ''But it's all changed. Most young women have never held, never even see, a newborn baby. It's really a shock.''         The first ''what to expect'' book emerged from the 1984 pregnancy of Mrs. Murkoff, Mrs. Eisenberg's younger daughter and a writer who was dismayed that she could find few books about pregnancy that were not excessively didactic and authoritarian -- not to mention full of incomprehensible medical terms. The mother and daughter and another daughter, Sandee E. Hathaway, a nurse, teamed up to fill the void.         They delivered their book proposal to the publisher hours before Mrs. Murkoff gave birth to a daughter, Emma. They delivered the book the day Mrs. Hathaway felt the first kick from the fetus that was to be her daughter Rachel.         The success of the first book led the three to answer readers' pleas for help after birth. In 1989, they published ''What to Expect the First Year,'' and in 1994, ''What to Expect the Toddler Years.'' They also published ''What to Eat When You're Expecting,'' in 1986, and ''The Pregnancy Organizer,'' in 1996. All were published by Workman.         Arlene Leila Scharaga was born in the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn on June 8, 1934. Her father, Harry Scharaga, headed the Sanitation Department in Queens.         When Arlene was 16, her mother took her to an Eddie Fisher concert at the Paramount Theater. Afterward, they met Mr. Fisher and his young press agent, Howard Eisenberg. Before long, she volunteered to help organize fan clubs for the singer, personally visiting his barber to retrieve locks of the star's hair to send to bobbysoxers around the country.         When there wasn't enough of Mr. Fisher's hair to go around, she would send locks of Mr. Eisenberg's, Mr. Eisenberg said. He began to suspect she was most interested in being around him.         A couple of years later, she said, ''I'm going to be 18 and I don't want to waste any time.''         Mr. Eisenberg asked her to marry him. ''She ran after me until I caught her,'' he said.         She dropped out of Queens College for marriage, but her ambitions and abilities transcended babies. Mr. Eisenberg recounted how he had writer's block on a freelance article for a Sunday supplement that appeared in many newspapers. The day before it was due, Mrs. Eisenberg sat at the typewriter and wrote the entire piece, which with a few revisions, was accepted.         The two wrote articles together for many popular magazines, including The Ladies' Home Journal, McCall's and Sports Illustrated. In 1965, they won the Gold Medal of the National Conference of Christians and Jews for a Look magazine piece, ''The Christian War Against Anti-Semitism.''         The family lived in Garden City on Long Island and in Spring Valley in Rockland County, N.Y., before moving to Manhattan 19 years ago.         When the daughters became adults, the women often collaborated long distance, with various drafts and rewrites conveyed by fax or computer.         Mrs. Eisenberg did not need a guidebook to be a different kind of mother. At a time when breast-feeding was out of favor, she did it with her daughters and a son, Evan. She also insisted on wheat germ and dark bread, prompting her children to envy schoolmates eating white bread in the lunchroom.         In addition to her husband and her son (also a writer), both of Manhattan; Mrs. Hathaway, of Newton, Mass.; and Mrs. Murkoff, of Santa Barbara, Calif., Mrs. Eisenberg is survived by her mother, Mildred Scharaga of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a brother, Victor Scharaga of Washington; and six grandchildren.         Another of Mrs. Eisenberg's legacies is the What to Expect Foundation, which she and Mrs. Murkoff founded after visiting pregnant inmates at Rikers Island, the New York City jail. The foundation is printing a basic pregnancy book written at a lower literacy level for disadvantaged women.         Mrs. Murkoff says she will probably carry on with the next chapter, entirely predictable, in the family's series: ''What to Expect in the Teen Years.'' Emma, whose imminent birth inspired the first book, is 17.       
         Fuki Kushida, a pioneer Japanese campaigner for women's rights, a peace activist and an opponent of nuclear weapons, died at her home in Tokyo on Monday, a family announcement said. She was 101.         In February last year, at the age of 1OO, Ms. Kushida made headlines from her wheelchair, leading a demonstration of Japanese women in the Ginza district of Tokyo against closer military ties with the United States.         Last summer, she also led protests against United States military bases on Okinawa after a United States Marine was charged with molesting a 14-year-old Japanese girl in her own bed on the eve of President Clinton's visit to the island for a summit meeting.         ''The recurrence of such unforgivable crimes by U.S. soldiers is extremely upsetting,'' Ms. Kushida said in a statement. ''As long as U.S. bases exist there, our fear will never end and violence against women will continue.''         Born in Yamaguchi Prefecture on Feb. 17, 1899, Ms. Kushida entered the Women's University in Tokyo but dropped out to marry Tamizo Kushida, a Marxist economist who died before the outbreak of World War II.         Left at 35 with two children to support and little money, Ms. Kushida worked as an insurance saleswomen and magazine reporter.         The hardships she experienced made her aware of the difficult lives many Japanese women led and encouraged her to devote her life to working for the advancement of women and the promotion of world peace.         After World War II, she joined the emerging Japanese feminist movement and worked with Yuriko Miyamoto, a leading feminist writer of the time. In 1946 Ms. Kushida became the first secretary general of a newly established feminist and peace organization called the Women's Democratic Club.         In 1958 she was elected third president of the Federation of Japanese Women's Organizations, a group opposed to nuclear weapons and committed to promoting peace. Today it encompasses 19 organizations and has about 900,000 members.       
         Kitty Buck, who with her husband, Otto, ran Cake Masters Bakery, an institution on the Upper West Side of Manhattan that made cakes for Liberace, President Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor -- and for less famous families' celebrations -- for more than half a century, died on Jan. 9 in Oceanside, N.Y.         She was 93 and lived in Manhattan.         Cake Masters, which the Bucks founded and operated, was known by its slogan, ''where baking is an art.'' At its peak, there were 15 shops, 14 in Manhattan and one in Queens. Many of the stores were clustered within blocks of each other on Broadway, a reflection of a time before supermarkets when people walked to bakeries for their daily loaves.         The chain developed the concept of cake as extravaganza, and sold many creations to theatrical and film productions. When Michael Todd staged a Madison Square Garden celebration in 1957 for the first anniversary of his movie ''Around the World in 80 Days,'' Cake Masters delivered the cake, even as an elephant delivered Mr. Todd's wife, Miss Taylor.         Mrs. Buck was born Gussie Rubin on June 15, 1907, in Hurleyville, N.Y., in the Catskills and attended a one-room school, where the teacher demanded, ''What kind of name is Gussie?'' According to her grandson Michael Halio, the teacher then said, ''I'm going to call you Katherine.''         She immediately shortened her new name to Kitty, and in the 1930's, had it legally changed.         She grew up on a dairy farm near Bridgeville, also in the Catskills, her daughter Barbara Halio said. Her father opened a rooming house for summer tourists, which later became the Capitol Hotel. When the hotel burned down in the late 1920's, the family moved to the Bronx and settled down on Morris Avenue.         She got a job as a sales clerk in a Bronx bakery, where a co-worker introduced her to Otto, a young baker who had recently immigrated from Germany. They married in 1930. In 1937, they borrowed $500 from Kitty's sister, Muriel, for a down payment on the first Cake Masters, at Broadway and 84th Street. Eventually baking operations were centralized at the company's building on West 72nd Street, which opened in 1955, and the other locations were used as stores.         In 1959, Mr. Buck died at 52. Mrs. Buck resolved to carry on. ''This is my husband's sweat and blood,'' she said, according to family lore.         A woman running what was then often a man's business, Mrs. Buck pushed racks around the bakery floor, rode to the stores in the cabs of her trucks and dealt with unions daily. In a photograph of a food industry gathering at the Waldorf-Astoria in 1965, she was the only woman on the dais.         By herself, she more than kept up the bakery's style. In 1961, it was a Cake Masters technician who was sent to Washington to confect a huge cake for President John F. Kennedy's inaugural ball. In 1982, a Cake Masters cake towered over the first ''Night of 100 Stars'' at Radio City Music Hall. Often, one of its creations was part of the bridal display at Tiffany & Company.         Mrs. Buck was also admired for her personal style, with some likening her upswept hair, smoky voice and quick wit to those of Lauren Bacall, who bought her children's birthday cakes at Cake Masters.         The stores began to close as rents rose and customers began to bypass butchers and bakers for supermarkets. The last Cake Masters shop, on Third Avenue at 65th Street, closed in 1992. Mrs. Buck, then 85, retired.         In addition to her daughter Barbara, of Oceanside, and her sister, Muriel Merritt, of San Antonio, Mrs. Buck is survived by another daughter, Joan Buck of Manhattan; five grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         Sonia Arova, a Bulgarian-born ballerina who became an international star and was an early partner of such great male dancers as Erik Bruhn and Rudolf Nureyev, died on Sunday in San Diego. She was 74.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Ms. Arova was the ballerina with whom Nureyev danced the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux at his New York debut with Ruth Page's Chicago Opera Ballet on March 10, 1962, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She and Bruhn first met in the mid-1940's in the Metropolitan Ballet, a short-lived but artistically enterprising London troupe.         Nureyev, Bruhn, Ms. Arova and the American ballerina Rosella Hightower joined forces to present sensationally successful programs together in Paris in 1962. Later that year, she was again Nureyev's ballerina as guest artist with the Royal Ballet in London.         A dancer of strong technique and dramatic projection, Ms. Arova was born Sonia Errio in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, where she studied music as well as ballet, receiving her dance training at the school of the Sofia Opera Ballet. When her teachers recommended further study in Paris, she left Bulgaria at age 11 with her mother. Her father sold his stamp collection to pay for her Parisian classes.         With the outbreak of World War II, Ms. Arova's British piano teacher in Paris urged her to escape France. Disguised in male attire as the teacher's son, Ms. Arova was smuggled into England on a fishing boat in 1940. She never saw her father again but was eventually reunited with her mother and sister.         In England, she danced with International Ballet (1942), Ballet Rambert (1946) and, most notably, with Metropolitan Ballet (1947-48). Then she became a balletic globe-trotter.         Ms. Arova was first associated with Page in Paris in 1951 when she danced a leading role in ''Revenge,'' the popular choreographic adaptation of the opera ''Il Trovatore'' that Page created for Les Ballets des Champs Élysées. Later, she appeared with Page's own Chicago company.         She was guest artist with American Ballet Theater several times in the 1950's and 60's, dancing both classical and contemporary works. Reviewing her performance in 1956, John Martin of The New York Times said she had become ''a lovely and curiously individual dancer, especially where dramatic color and characterization are involved.''         She also danced with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, the Marquis de Cuevas Ballet, London Festival Ballet, the Komaki Ballet of Japan, the Australian Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington.         Ms. Arova became increasingly involved with company direction, often in association with Thor Sutowski, the American dancer and choreographer, whom she married in 1965. As director of the Norwegian National Ballet from 1966 to 1970, she introduced several ballets by George Balanchine into the repertory, produced the first complete Oslo versions of ''Swan Lake'' and ''La Sylphide'' and was knighted for her services by King Olaf V.         She became director of the San Diego Ballet in 1971. In 1977 she and Mr. Sutowski were named co-directors of the dance department at the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a state-run high school in Birmingham. Many dancers they trained joined the Birmingham-based Ballet South, which made its New York debut at Brooklyn College in 1996 with a ''Swan Lake,'' staged by Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski. Anna Kisselgoff of The Times praised it for allowing its young women to ''show off a brilliant clarity and detail in their footwork'' and ''dance with a pure classical style.''         Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski returned to San Diego in 1997, where they taught for both the San Diego Ballet and the California Ballet.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Ariane Sutowski of San Diego, and a sister, Jeanette Errio of Vence, France.       
         Rosalie Gwathmey, a photographer who was noted for the warmth and artful simplicity of her pictures of black Southern communities, and who threw away all her negatives in 1955 after donating most of her prints to the New York Public Library, died on Monday at her home in Amagansett, N.Y., said her son, the architect Charles Gwathmey. She was 92.         A textile designer throughout the 1960's and 70's, Mrs. Gwathmey seldom looked back on her photographic past, which was in turn largely forgotten by the photographic world. That changed in 1994. A solo exhibition of her images from the 40's, at Glenn Horowitz Bookseller in East Hampton, N.Y., suddenly revived interest in her work.         Like the photographer Doris Ulmann, who found grace and simple beauty in a South Carolina black community in the 20's and early 30's, Mrs. Gwathmey focused on black life in her hometown, Charlotte, N.C., and in Rocky Mount, N.C. Unlike Ulmann, whose pictures of mostly poor blacks have a gentle, dignified grandeur, Mrs. Gwathmey's more sharply focused images are grittier, reflecting a quirkier mind and eye.         In the foreground of a picture from the 40's a woman sits calmly in a chair on the porch of her modest house, a crowded clothesline stretching from a nearby post. Behind her, though, bulldozers are busily clearing the ground for a highway.         In another photograph a barefoot sharecropper stands at a doorway, his steady gaze on the photographer, his checked shirt and patched trousers somehow all of a piece with the bold wood planks on an exterior wall festooned with garlands of peppers.         In 1946 Mrs. Gwathmey's work was in a New Photographers group show at the Museum of Modern Art. Edward Steichen included one of her images in the Family of Man exhibition in 1955, the year that Mrs. Gwathmey's photographic career abruptly ended.         Since the early 40's she had been involved with the Photo League in Manhattan, whose members included Paul Strand, Berenice Abbott, Dorothea Lange and W. Eugene Smith. But when the league was attacked as subversive during the McCarthy era, its membership evaporated and the league disbanded in 1951. Tired of keeping her work in the closet, Mrs. Gwathmey simply walked away from photography, she said in an interview for the Glenn Horowitz exhibition catalog.         Rosalie Hook was born on Sept. 15, 1908, in Charlotte. Intending to be a portrait painter, she studied at the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, where she met Robert Gwathmey, who would become known for his social realist paintings. They married in 1935.         After their son, Charles, was born in 1938 and they were living in Pittsburgh, Mrs. Gwathmey took up photography. ''I was crazy about the way the city looked,'' she said. She studied there with the photographer Luke Swank.         At the Photo League she studied with Paul Strand. ''Paul was a perfectionist,'' she recalled in the same catalog interview. ''He taught his students to save only their perfect prints, to mat them beautifully and to frame them beautifully.'' Her reaction was, ''I began to feel it was too precious.''         A few years before her 1994 exhibition, she recalled, she had written to the New York Public Library, saying that she would like to have some of her pictures back. ''I had a chance to sell some and I could use the money.'' The library gave her 15 duplicates. She signed them and gave them to the buyer. Several transactions later, the pictures ended up in the possession of Mr. Horowitz.         Mrs. Gwathmey, whose husband died in 1988, is survived by her son and two grandchildren.         She said she saw her photography as a ''documentary thing,'' and not as an art form. In fact, the humanism in her work went with an artist's eye for composition and form. ''We all know,'' she said, ''that if the language isn't eloquent, no one bothers to finish the story.''       
         Rose Freedman, the last survivor of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Thursday in her apartment in Beverly Hills, Calif., her daughter said. She was 107.         Mrs. Freedman, who at the time of the Manhattan fire was two days shy of 18, escaped death in 1911 by following company executives to the roof to be rescued. She became a lifelong crusader for worker safety, telling and retelling the story that the Triangle workers died because the owners were not concerned with their welfare.         The disastrous factory fire, in which girls and young women leapt from eighth- and ninth-story windows, their flaming skirts billowing in the wind, horrified the nation and led to some of the first city, state and federal laws dealing with workers' safety. It gave a powerful impetus to the fledgling labor movement, greatly strengthening the building of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which two years before the fire had led a three-month strike to focus attention on conditions in workplaces like the Triangle factory.         The union's successor, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, confirmed that Mrs. Freedman, who was Rose Rosenfeld at the time of the fire, was the last survivor to die. The next-to-last, Bessie Cohen, died two years ago.         Mrs. Freedman's life after the fire was colorful and courageous. In World War I, she saved the life of a spy in Austria. After her husband's death, in 1959, she went back to work to support her three children, two of whom had polio. Lying about her age, she worked at a Manhattan insurance company until she was 79.         Mrs. Freedman, who always wore high heels, celebrated her centennial by attending Spanish classes in a Mexican town with cobblestone streets, but refused to abandon her heels for more sensible shoes. ''I'd look matronly,'' she said.         Her involvement in the fire never left her consciousness, and she appeared at labor rallies for the rest of her life. She always expressed rage that the factory doors had been locked, either to keep workers at their machines or to prevent them from stealing scraps of cloth. She always told of how one of the owners tried to bribe her to say the doors were not locked. She refused.         The owners were eventually acquitted of manslaughter charges when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families.         On the day of the fire, Mrs. Freedman escaped the inferno by stopping to consider what the executives were doing. She somehow thought they would be safer, and went up to the 10th floor, where their offices were, to find out. They were taking the freight elevator to the roof, where firefighters pulled them to the roof of an adjacent building. She did the same.         The alternative was jumping.         ''Girls in shirtwaists, which were aflame, went flying out of the building so that you saw these young women literally ablaze flying out of the windows,'' she said in a Public Broadcasting System documentary, ''The Living Century,'' shown in December and January.         As she was taken down the steps of the adjacent building, she stopped on each stoop to sit down and cry. ''When I came in the street, here comes my father,'' she recalled. ''He collapsed. He fainted. And I didn't go back to work anymore. I went to college.''         The anger about what she saw as the owners' greed persisted. In the documentary, she said:         ''That's the whole trouble of this fire. Nobody cares. Nobody. Hundred forty-six people in a half an hour. I have always tears in my eyes when I think. It should never have happened. The executives with a couple of steps could have opened the door. But they thought they were better than the working people. It's not fair because material, money, is more important here than everything.         ''That's the biggest mistake -- that a person doesn't count much when he hasn't got money. What good is a rich man and he hasn't got a heart? I don't pretend. I feel it. Still.''         Rose Rosenfeld was born on March 27, 1893, in a small town north of Vienna. Her family ran a profitable business importing and exporting dried foods. After her father visited New York and fell in love with it, the family began spending more and more time in the United States, finally emigrating in 1909. They sailed on the Mauretania.         With Mrs. Freedman's father devoting most of his time to Jewish studies, the business was run by her mother. An aunt who lived with the family once sharply criticized the young woman's housecleaning abilities. ''You call this work?'' she demanded.         Mrs. Freedman's response was to go out the next day and take a job at the Triangle factory. Since her language skills were good -- she eventually spoke seven languages -- she was given the prestigious job of operating a large machine to attach buttons to the blouses. Her only close friend at the factory, a forewoman, died in the fire.         She attended college in New York, although family members are not sure where.         When she and her mother took a trip to their Austrian hometown to show Mrs. Freedman's grandparents that she was really alive, World War I had broken out, and the Russians had invaded Austria. Her grandfather had befriended a man who turned out to be a Russian spying against his own country for Austria. She told of hiding him by burying him in coal in the basement, then talking the pursuing Cossacks into leaving without a search.         After returning to New York, she got a job with Cunard, the steamship line. In 1927, she married Harry Freedman, an American she had first met at the American Club in Vienna. He owned a typewriter store in New York.         They had three children. When the two youngest were stricken with polio, Mrs. Freedman asked when they would be able to walk. The doctor said, ''Five years.'' She replied, ''I have time.''         Mr. Freedman died at 59, leaving Mrs. Freedman no money or source of income. She got an accounting job at the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Her youthful appearance enabled her to say she was 50, when she was actually 64.         ''Of course it was a lie, but they didn't know it was a lie,'' she said. She worked until she was 79.         In 1995, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son Robert and her daughter, Arlene March, live. There, she became such an avid fan of the Lakers that she became livid if someone phoned while a game was being shown on television. On her 100th birthday she was presented with a team jersey bearing the number 100.         She exhibited paintings at the Beverly Hills Art Fair, and continued to paint almost until her death. She had her hair and nails done weekly, and shopped and cooked for herself.         Mrs. Freedman was still attending Spanish language classes at 107.         ''To me, 106 is a number,'' she said in the documentary. ''I lived that long, not only on account of my genes, but on account of my attitude. You've got to stand up for yourself. Am I right?''         Other survivors are another son, Herbert, of Rye Brook, N.Y., eight grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. She was overjoyed at the great-granddaughter's birth, and always advised the child's mother, her granddaughter, Dana Walden, who is president of 20th Century Fox Television, not to get caught in grief when loved ones died.         ''Sadness takes years from you,'' she said.         Her own passing ends a chapter of history. Steven Latham, director of the documentary, suggested it was something like the last Holocaust survivor dying.         ''This is the last voice of an event,'' he said. ''This woman actually smelled the smoke.''       
         Dr. Donella Hager Meadows, an author, educator and advocate for the environment, died Tuesday at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center in Lebanon, N.H. She was 59 and lived in Hartland Four Corners, N.H.         The cause was bacterial meningitis, said Prof. Jack E. Shepherd Jr., a friend and colleague at Dartmouth, where she was an adjunct professor of environmental sciences.         Dr. Meadows, known as Dana, was a MacArthur Fellow and the lead author of ''The Limits of Growth: A Report for the Club of Rome's Project on the Predicament of Mankind,'' published in 1972. The book delivered a simple message: either civilization or growth must end.         The book stated that continued population and industrial growth would exhaust the world's minerals and steep the planet in lethal levels of pollution.         If trends continued unchanged, the authors said, the limits of growth would be reached within 100 years. They urged ''deliberate checks'' on economic and population growth.         Their thesis was sharply disputed at the time, but the book sold nine million copies and was translated into 28 languages. It was produced by an interdisciplinary team at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and financed by the Club of Rome, an international research organization that studies ''the complex of problems troubling men of all nations,'' like poverty, alienated youth and monetary disruptions.         In 1992, she and her co-authors, Jorgen Randers and Dr. Dennis L. Meadows, her former husband, published an update, ''Beyond the Limits: Confronting Global Collapse, Envisioning a Sustainable Future.''         Based partly on new computer simulations, the book warned that unless human activity changed, humans would ''overshoot'' the carrying capacity of the planet in decades.         Both books remain in print, as does a selection from ''The Global Citizen,'' the weekly syndicated column she wrote.         Dana Meadows was born in Elgin, Ill., and graduated from Carleton College in Minnesota in 1963. She received a doctorate in biophysics from Harvard University in 1968.         She was a researcher in the Department of Nutrition at M.I.T. when ''The Limits of Growth'' report was written.         She later taught and researched at centers in Hawaii, Austria and Norway. In 1972, she joined an interdisciplinary program at Dartmouth, the Resource Policy Center, rising to associate professor.         She and her former husband founded the International Network of Research Information Centers, in which they organized training programs and workshops in resource management in Europe, Central America, Africa, Asia and the United States. In 1994, the John D. and Catherine MacArthur Foundation, known for its ''genius grants,'' selected her for a fellowship and awarded her  $320,000 over five years.         Dr. Meadows is survived by her parents, Phebe Quist of Tahlequah, Okla., and Don Hager of Palatine, Ill.; and a brother, Jason Hager of Waterford, Wis. Her former husband lives in Durham, N.H.         Correction:  March 17, 2001, Saturday  An obituary of the author and environmentalist Donella Meadows on Feb. 22 misidentified her home state. Her town, Hartland Four Corners, is in Vermont, not New Hampshire.       
         Miné Okubo, a Japanese-American artist who recorded in 2,000 drawings and a book what she saw and felt as an internee in American detention camps for Japanese and Japanese-Americans during World War II, died on Feb. 10 in Manhattan. She was 88 and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Okubo, who pronounced her first name mee-neh, was one of 110,000 Japanese and Japanese-Americans living in Western states who were evacuated from their homes early in 1942. They were interned by the federal government as a precautionary measure, a move that has been much criticized. Two-thirds of the internees were, like her, American citizens.         She was born to Japanese immigrant parents in Riverside, Calif. Her father worked as a gardener. She received a master's degree in art from the University of California at Berkeley. In 1938 she was awarded a fellowship to study and travel in Europe, but World War II cut short her stay.         Early in the 1940's, she was employed by the Works Progress Administration in San Francisco. While the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera stood on scaffolding and painted murals, she was below, explaining his work to onlookers.         The Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 changed her life painfully for two years. Other members of her family were also interned.         ''Nothing had been prepared or planned for this rushed and forced evacuation,'' she wrote in 1983 in a new edition of her book, ''Citizen 13660'' (University of Washington Press), which originally appeared in 1946. ''There were untold hardships, sadness, and misery.''         She and her brother Toku were sent to an ''assembly center'' in San Bruno, Calif. There they had to live for almost half a year in what had been a horse stall. Later they were sent to ''protective custody'' in the Topaz Relocation Center in the Utah desert. She spent the rest of the two years there and then was released.         ''Because of the injustices and contradictions nothing made much sense'' in the camps, she wrote in 1983, but in them she had the opportunity ''to see what happens to people when reduced to one status and condition. Cameras and photographs were not permitted in the camps, so I recorded everything in sketches, drawings and paintings.'' In a 1947 interview, she said that at the Topaz camp, ''You had to work hard to keep yourself going, and to keep from thinking.''         She sent a drawing of a Topaz guard to an art show in San Francisco. It won a prize, which led to assignments from Fortune magazine to illustrate articles. This freed her from Topaz and brought her to Manhattan, where she made her home until her death.         ''Citizen 13660,'' containing text and 206 drawings, won praise when it appeared. The book was named for the number Miss Okubo was given as an internee. ''The number was on suitcases and everything you owned, all the papers you signed,'' she recalled. ''You became a number.''         She wrote in 1983 that the book had begun ''as a special group of drawings made to tell the story of camp life for my many friends who faithfully sent letters and packages to let us know we were not forgotten.''         A review in The New York Times Book Review in 1946 said: ''In a remarkably objective and vivid and even humorous account,'' Miss Okubo told the whole story of her internment ''in dramatic and detailed drawings and brief text.''         ''The drawings reveal a two-way process at work,'' the review said, ''the gradual demoralization of a group where family ties had ceased to matter under the system of mass living and mass feeding, and the resourcefulness and resilience of these fellow-Americans who tried desperately to turn negative living into something positive.''         After moving to Manhattan, Ms. Okubo did freelance illustration and then resumed painting full time. Her work appeared in solo and group exhibitions at museums including the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York.         She is survived by a sister, Yoshi Tanaka of Fallbrook, Calif.       
         Sylvia Lawry, whose brother's incurable multiple sclerosis prompted her to found national and international organizations to fight the disease, died on Saturday at Bird S. Coler Hospital on Roosevelt Island. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Lawry founded both the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the United States, in 1946, and the International Federation of Multiple Sclerosis Societies, in 1967. She was also one of the leaders of the effort to establish the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke at the National Institutes of Health, in 1950.         It all began with a classified advertisement in 1945 in which Ms. Lawry beseeched readers to write her of any cures for multiple sclerosis. Instead, she got more than 50 replies asking for the same thing. Her life's mission was the result.         Multiple sclerosis is a disease of the central nervous system. Its onslaught is signaled by sudden neurological symptoms, including loss of vision, paralysis, numbness and difficulties in walking, as nerves lose their sheathing and are unable to conduct signals.         Partly as a result of research financed by the societies started by Ms. Lawry, scientists now suspect that the disease may be caused by a viral infection on top of an inherited genetic susceptibility, though the specific triggering mechanism remains unknown.         The national society has also helped develop medicines to alleviate symptoms and prolong life expectancy, essentially offering a normal life span to many with multiple sclerosis. In 1890, when multiple sclerosis was treated with herbs and bed rest, life expectancy was five years.  But there is still no cure for the disease, which the society says strikes another adult each hour, leaving the most afflicted paralyzed.         ''Sylvia's uncompromising battle for more than a half century to solve the mystery of multiple sclerosis made her a hero to anyone touched by this devastating disease,'' said Richard Slifka, chairman of the society.         The national society credited her with the first use of the abbreviation M.S. for the disease. The Oxford English Dictionary cites as the first use of the term a 1955 article in Science News Letter discussing work by the society.         Sylvia Friedman was born in Brooklyn on June 28, 1915. Her father manufactured Venetian blinds. She graduated from Hunter College in 1936 and went to work in the office of her father's attorney as a receptionist. She hoped to go to law school and took a job in the United States attorney's office in Manhattan.         In 1944, she married Michael Lawry; they were divorced two years later. She used the last name Lawry for the rest of her life, though she married Stanley Englander, who was in the wholesale meat business, in 1957. He died in 1968.         When Ms. Lawry's brother, Bernard, was stricken with multiple sclerosis in 1945, she and her sister Alice placed a classified advertisement in The New York Times: ''Multiple sclerosis. Will anyone recovered from it please communicate with patient. T272 Times.''         The sisters received 54 replies from people as desperate as they were. Most asked to be informed if the two heard anything promising.         ''I was looking for medical clues that might have helped my brother,'' Ms. Lawry said in an interview with The New York Post in 1959. ''But when the responses started to snowball and come from all over the country, I decided to give up the law and let my creative energies spill over into helping M.S. victims.''         Starting with family and friends, Ms. Lawry built a network. Her sister Alice helped. Her other sister, Lillian, and her husband, Stanley Wilson, founded one of the first local chapters, in the Bronx.         Ms. Lawry is survived by Lillian Wilson, who lives in Spring Valley, N.Y.; two sons, Frank Englander of Manhattan, and Steven Englander of Montgomery, N.Y., and two grandchildren.         The fight against multiple sclerosis grew. A tiny office was found. The doctors whom Ms. Lawry first consulted about her brother became interested in the effort.         Dee Sammak, the accounts payable manager who has worked for the society since 1954, said she has stayed all these years because of the inspiration of Ms. Lawry. ''Don't forget,'' Ms. Sammak said, ''when she started the society, women were not doing these things -- to start a society in a man's world.''         On March 11, 1946, Ms. Lawry assembled 20 prominent research scientists to found the Association for Advancement of Research in Multiple Sclerosis, which was renamed the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in 1947. Its first research grant went toward studying the relationship between the body's immune system and the effects of multiple sclerosis on the central nervous system.         Though her brother's health progressively weakened until his death in 1973, the organization Ms. Lawry founded gathered momentum. In 1950, she teamed up with Senator Charles Tobey of New Hampshire, whose daughter had multiple sclerosis, to lobby Congress for what is now the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.         The law creating the institute passed on Aug. 15, 1950. At that time, total federal appropriations for research on multiple sclerosis were $14,000. They now total $100 million a year, the society said.         Ms. Lawry's political skills were evident throughout her career. A frequent tactic, she told CNN in 1995, was to lobby people who had relatives or acquaintances with the disease. She mentioned winning support from President John F. Kennedy, who had a cousin with the disease, and Grace Kelly, whose first fiancé had it.         The international organization was born after the national society realized it was giving almost one-third of its research grants to foreigners. There are now 38 societies around the world.         Ms. Lawry, who worked 12-hour days, said she would never retire until multiple sclerosis retired. The disease still affects 1 in 1,000 people in the United States.         ''There was a continuing pain in her heart, because what she really wanted to see was M.S. go the way of polio,'' said Arney Rosenblat, a society spokeswoman.       
         Constance Myers Anderson, a former head of both the New York City and national Young Women's Christian Association, died Jan. 31 at her retirement home in Kennett Square, Penn. Mrs. Anderson, a former resident of New York City and of Wilton, Conn., was 102.         Mrs. Anderson, a 1919 graduate of Vassar College, was a longtime volunteer worker. She was the chairwoman and board member of the New York City Y.W.C.A. She was also president of the national organization from 1946 to 1952 and afterward was an honorary board member. She was a lifelong member of its World Service Council.         She helped found the United Service Organizations and was a former board member of the United States Committee for Unicef. She also was a member of the Riverside Church Board of Deacons. Mrs. Anderson is survived by a daughter, Constance A. Tate of Wilton; three grandsons, and seven great-grandchildren. She was the widow of Dr. Arthur Forrest Anderson.       
         Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the lyrical author and aviator whose marriage to Charles A. Lindbergh brought her both joy and tragedy, died yesterday at her home in Passumpsic, Vt. She was 94.         Their daughter Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her 1998 memoir ''Under a Wing'' (Simon & Schuster) that her mother had suffered adverse effects from her advancing age and from strokes and was ''often confused in her mind, and in fragile health.''         Anne Morrow Lindbergh scored an immense literary success in midlife with her 1955 book ''Gift From the Sea'' ( Pantheon), which was a philosophical meditation on women's lives in this century. It was on the nonfiction best-seller list of The New York Times for 80 weeks and was No. 1 for 47 of those weeks. In the book's first 20 years in print, more than five million copies were sold in hard-cover and paperback editions.         Mrs. Lindbergh was the author of more than two dozen books of prose and poetry, including five volumes of diaries; her work was often acclaimed by critics and popular with readers. Despite the literary distinction that she achieved, her life was largely shaped by two dramatic experiences when she was in her 20's. One was blissful, one was anguished. They were reflected in the title of a volume of her diaries: ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead'' (1973, Harcourt, Brace).         The first experience came in 1927 when Anne Morrow, then a 21-year-old senior at Smith College, arrived for the Christmas holidays in Mexico City, where her well-to-do father, Dwight W. Morrow, was the American ambassador.         'He Is Taller Than Anyone Else'         There she met Charles Lindbergh, whose courageous solo flight across the Atlantic had made him a hero of mythic proportions and the most famous man in the world. He was staying with her family, and the sight of the boyish aviator tugged at her heartstrings.         ''He is taller than anyone else,'' she wrote in her diary. ''You see his head in a moving crowd, and you notice his glance, where it turns, as though it were keener, clearer and brighter than anyone else's, lit with a more intense fire. What could I say to this boy? Anything I might say would be trivial and superficial, like pink frosting flowers. I felt the whole world before this to be frivolous, superficial, ephemeral.''         Two years later the man known as Lucky Lindy married the shy, literary Miss Morrow. The glamorous Lindberghs were seldom out of the news as they made pioneering flights to Latin America and Asia, becoming ''the First Couple of the Skies.'' As the critic Alfred Kazin observed, ''To millions around the world -- reading of the Lindberghs flying everywhere in their own Lockheed Sirius seaplane, looking at photographs of the 'perfect'-looking couple ('the Lone Eagle and his mate') landing in Siberia, China, Japan -- the Lindberghs seemed to enjoy the greatest possible good fortune that a young couple could have.''         But that second experience came four years later, on the evening of March 1, 1932, in Hopewell, N.J., where the Lindberghs were at home with their 20-month-old son, Charles Jr., and a nurse, Betty Gow. The nurse looked in now and then on Charlie as he slept in his crib.         ''At 10 Betty went in to the baby, shut the window, then lit the electric stove, then turned to the bed; it was empty, and the sides still up,'' Mrs. Lindbergh wrote later in a letter to her mother-in-law. At first Miss Gow  thought Lindbergh had taken his son from the crib for a joke, Mrs. Lindbergh continued, adding poignantly, ''I did, until I saw his face.'' Lindbergh, looking down at his diminutive wife, said, ''Anne, they have stolen our baby.''         The Lindberghs were soon enveloped in the horror of the kidnapping, the discovery of the child's body on May 12, more than 10 weeks later, and the subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a carpenter, for Charlie's murder in 1936.         They had always been ''intensely private persons with an austere, restrained, glowingly creative sense of life,'' Mr. Kazin wrote. Both had a fear of crowds and nothing, even Lindbergh's 1927 landing in Paris, had prepared them for the carnival of reporters, photographers, con artists, curiosity-seekers, vandals and  crazy people who had invaded their lives after their baby was kidnapped. Americans would not experience a similar flood of publicity until the O. J. Simpson murder trial of the 1990's.         The Literary Career She Always Wanted         Mrs. Lindbergh would never get over her child's death but she went on to bear five more children and to have the literary career she had dreamed of. The historian Geoffrey C. Ward wrote in 1998 that '''Gift From the Sea' became a source of inspiration for a whole generation of wives and mothers -- 'the great vacationless class,' she called them -- who, like herself, were beginning to search for more fulfilling lives once their children had grown and moved away.''         Mrs. Lindbergh echoed many women's concerns with observations like this: ''What a circus act we women perform every day of our lives. Look at us. We run a tightrope daily, balancing a pile of books on the head. Baby-carriage, parasol, kitchen chair, still under control. Steady now! This is not the life of simplicity but the life of multiplicity that the wise men warn us of. It leads not to unification but to fragmentation. It does not bring grace; it destroys the soul.''         Lewis Gannett wrote that her 1938 best seller, ''Listen! The Wind,'' had ''caught the poetry of flight in a web of words as no other book on flying has yet contrived to do.'' Alfred Kazin admired her as ''a lyricist of action.''         Millions of Americans respected  Mrs. Lindbergh,too. The readers of Good Housekeeping magazine voted her one of their 10 most admired women in 1975, when she was 69 and had a flock of grandchildren . This admiration was expressed over and over during her long life -- notably by letter-writers at the time of the kidnapping. And after the poet John Ciardi reviewed ''The Unicorn and Other Poems'' (Random House) in The Saturday Review and called her poetry ''inept, jingling, slovenly, illiterate,'' the magazine was soon rocked by what its editor, Norman Cousins, called ''the biggest storm of reader protest in our 33-year history'' -- most of it from Mrs. Lindbergh's female admirers.         The respect for Mrs. Lindbergh also survived bitter controversy over her 1940 book ''The Wave of the Future,'' a short, hazy manifesto, written while World War II raged in Europe. She wrote that she did not endorse communism or fascism, but that she saw them as inevitable effects of what she called the ''wave of the future.'' She also said she hoped the United States could avoid entering the conflict. And, in a letter, she wrote that she was beginning to feel that Hitler was ''a very great man, like an inspired religious leader -- and as such rather fanatical -- but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power.''         'Both Very Blind In the Beginning         ''The Wave of the Future'' was widely criticized when it appeared. Rabbi Abraham D. Shaw of Baltimore, for example, said in a speech in 1941 to a gathering of the Union of American of American Hebrew Congregations that it was the epitome of defeatism, and that in it Mrs. Lindbergh had counseled surrender to what he called the ''anti-religious, anti-ethical hordes.''         In later years, Walter S. Ross wrote in his 1967 biography ''The Last Hero: Charles A. Lindbergh'' that the book ''took so astral a view of the world that it made the crimes of the Nazis seem to bulk no larger than the inadequacies'' of the democracies.'' Some friends said they thought Mrs. Lindbergh had written the book at least partly to please her husband, who at that time was an ardent advocate of the United States' staying out of the war.         Mrs. Lindbergh herself later acknowledged that she and her husband had been ''both very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst evils of the Nazi system.'' But she said that she had warned him that he would offend many Americans with an isolationist speech that he prepared to give in September 1941 in Des Moines, in which he warned Jews of retribution for being among the leading ''war agitators'' along with the British and the Roosevelt Administration. Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her book that years later her mother told her: ''If only he had listened to me. I told him what would happen if he listed 'interventionist' groups in that way . . . 'the British,' 'the Roosevelt Administration,' and 'the Jews.' I told him he would be called anti-Semitic.''         Mrs. Lindbergh recalled that he replied, ''But I'm not!'' and that she said: '' 'It doesn't matter. That's what will happen.' But he didn't believe me.''         When he gave the speech, he said: ''The leaders of both the British and Jewish races, for reasons which are understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war. We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own interests, but we also must look out for ours. We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to lead our country to destruction.''         Later Mrs. Lindbergh wrote in her diary: ''He is attacked on all sides, Administration, pressure groups, and Jews, as now openly a Nazi, following a Nazi doctrine.''         In her diary volume called ''War Within and Without'' (1980), she said she experienced a ''profound feeling of grief'' over what her husband had said and decided it was ''at best unconsciously a bid for anti-Semitism. It is a match lit near a pile of excelsior.''         Some friends said that the above-the-battle stance that she evidenced in ''The Last Wave'' and in other writing -- her diaries during the mid-'30's made scant mention of the large political and social questions of the day -- was a reflection, in part, of her privileged, sheltered upbringing.         Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906, in Englewood, N.J. Her father became a multimillionaire partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company, who went on to become a Republican Senator from New Jersey. Her mother was Elizabeth Reeve Cutter Morrow, an educator and poet who was Smith College's acting president in 1939 and 1940 and who publicly criticized her daughter and son-in-law for their America First views.         Young Anne attended Miss Chapin's School in Manhattan, where her family maintained an apartment, and went on to Smith, where she won two literary prizes before she graduated in 1928. When she met Lindbergh, she was an intensely shy and romantic woman, only a bit over 5 feet tall, with grave blue eyes and a demure, schoolgirlish manner.         ''To be deeply in love is, of course, a great liberating force,'' she observed in the introduction to ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead.'' ''The sheer fact of finding myself loved was unbelievable and changed my world, my feelings about life and myself. I was given confidence, strength and almost a new character. The man I was to marry believed in me and what I could do, and consequently I found I could do more than I realized, even in that mysterious outer world that fascinated me but seemed unattainable. He opened the door to 'real life,' and though it frightened me, it also beckoned. I had to go.''         Mrs. Lindbergh wrote that before her marriage she had seen her husband-to-be more or less as ''a knight in shining armor, with myself as his devoted page.''         Was this a good basis for marriage? ''Hardly,'' she concluded. ''But it was a role I could play until I grew up. It was not a bad beginning.''         In 1929 the young couple were wed in a simple Protestant service in the drawing room of the Morrow family's hilltop manor in Englewood.  Just before the wedding began, Lindbergh strode out into the garden and picked a bouquet of larkspur and columbine for his bride to carry. Their marriage was the lead story on the front page of The New York Times and newspapers all over the world.         For their honeymoon the couple cruised to Maine in Lindbergh's motor launch, and the traveling continued in the first years of their marriage. Mrs. Lindbergh went with her husband, who was active in commercial aviation and scientific research, on many aerial journeys to Europe, to Asia, and to the Caribbean, where he was charting airplane routes.         She learned to navigate, to operate a radio, to pilot a plane. In 1930 she became the first woman to get a glider pilot's license in the United States. That same year she was co-pilot and navigator when her husband broke the transatlantic speed record. In 1934 she became the first woman to to receive the Hubbard Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society. Her first book, ''North to the Orient'' (Harcourt Brace), which became a best seller in 1935, was an account of one of their aerial voyages.         After living in a farmhouse in Princeton, the Lindberghs moved into a house that they had built on a 400-acre tract of land in the remote borough of Hopewell, near Trenton. It was there that their child was kidnapped. ''Everything is telescoped now into one moment, one of those eternal moments -- the moment when I realized that the baby had been taken,'' she wrote in her diary. In that ''first flash of horror,'' she wrote, she had seen in her mind's eye ''the baby dead, killed violently.''         ''Everything since then has been unreal,'' she continued. ''It has all vanished like smoke. Only that eternal moment remains. I feel strangely a sense of peace -- not peace, but an end to restlessness, a finality, as though I were sleeping in a grave.''         The hysteria and confusion attached to ''the Crime of the Century''  included weeks of negotiation with the kidnapper, the unavailing delivery of $50,000 in ransom money at a Bronx cemetery and many sensations and false leads. The baby's body was discovered in some nearby woods; he had been killed by a blow on the head soon after the kidnapping. Eventually, Mr. Hauptmann was traced through a banknote that had been part of the ransom. He was put on trial in Flemington, N.J., and Mrs. Lindbergh went on the witness stand for the prosecution to identify a flannel shirt -- made from an old petticoat of hers -- that had been found on the murdered baby. Tears brimmed in her eyes, but she never lost her composure.         After the trial, the Lindberghs tried to go on living in the United States, but there were threats on the life of their second child, a son named Jon, who was born on Aug. 16, 1932, and other harassments, largely from cranks and aggressive reporters. Late in 1935 the Lindberghs moved to England to seek escape from what Lindbergh called the ''tremendous public hysteria'' that surrounded him in the United States. On May 12, 1937, their third child, a boy named Land was born in a London nursing home, where Mrs. Lindbergh had registered under an assumed name.         She accompanied her husband on his visits to aviation-industry plants in France and in Nazi Germany. But she was not present at a stag dinner in 1938 at the American Embassy in Berlin, when Hermann Göring, whom Hitler had named Air Minister in 1933, presented Lindbergh with a high German decoration.         Mr. Ross, the Lindbergh biographer, wrote that when, after the dinner, Lindbergh showed the medal-box to his wife, ''she opened it and glanced at the medal and looked away. Then she said, without the slightest trace of emotion, 'the Albatross.''' She was right. Lindbergh was widely criticized in the United States for having accepted a medal from the Nazi Government.         In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the Lindberghs moved back to the United States, where Lindbergh's isolationist pronouncements made him widely unpopular. Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband to gatherings of isolationists and did not take public exception to his views. She said later that he had been ''used'' by the Nazis but that he had been genuinely ''astonished and impressed by the rapid growth of German air power,'' while also recognizing the danger it posed.         A. Scott Berg's 1998 biography of her husband, ''Lindbergh'' (Putnam), which drew on previously inaccessible family papers provided by Mrs. Lindbergh, showed that she was more aware of the flaws in Charles Lindbergh's character than had been thought. Mr. Berg reported problems in Mrs. Lindbergh's marriage that were painful for her, among them her husband's frequent absences, his bossiness, argumentativeness and emotional remoteness. After the birth of each of their six children, Mr. Berg wrote, Lindbergh would take his wife away on long plane journeys, some lasting weeks, as a way of ''weaning'' her from her children. He was angry at her displays of emotion (even after the kidnapping and murder of their child), and he would scold her if she complained she was having trouble with her writing.         Summing up, Mr. Berg wrote that the couple's relationship was ''a complex case history of control and repression, filled with joy and passion and grief and rage.'' He said in a 1998 interview that there was no doubt that Lindbergh ''deeply loved his wife and children, but that love manifested itself in unusual ways. It's ironic that it was Lindbergh who fostered his own wife's feminism. He very much wanted her to stand on her own two feet and, in helping her do so, created so much independence that it almost separated them.''         Falling in Love With Other Men         In the summer of 1939, Mr. Berg wrote, Mrs. Lindbergh, ''living less with Charles than through him, only knew that she was feeling incomplete and unfulfilled -- and mildly depressed.'' And then she, ''most unexpectedly, found inspiration, and even more, as she fell in love with another man.'' The man was Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the renowned French aviator-author, who visited the Lindberghs at their house in Lloyd Neck, N.Y. Mrs. Lindbergh and Saint-Exupéry talked in French, just the two of them, for hours. She was thrilled and bewitched when he spoke to her about her writing.         But she did not leave her husband for Saint-Exupéry, who already had both a wife and a paramour. He vanished in 1944 on a reconnaissance mission.         Charles Lindbergh's abhorrence of any display of emotion or weakness took a toll on his family. Mrs. Lindbergh suffered from depression and in defiance of her husband had daily psychotherapy sessions for a time, wrote Susan Hertog, a freelance journalist and photographer, in her biography ''Anne Morrow Lindbergh'' (Doubleday, 1999).         In ''Lindbergh'' Mr. Berg wrote that she became close to Dr. Dana W. Atchley, an internist affiliated with Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, who also had a difficult marriage. ''The friendship of these two longing souls blossomed into a love affair in 1956,'' Mr. Berg wrote, ''and continued for the next few years.''         Mrs. Lindbergh discussed with friends the possibility of a divorce, Mr. Berg reported, but she realized that she did not want one.         They continued to lead lives that were largely sheltered and secretive until Charles Lindbergh, suffering from cancer, died in 1974 at age 72 on the Hawaiian island of Maui. He and his wife were married for 45 years and it was the only enduring relationship of his life. In her later years Mrs. Lindbergh spent much of her time in her secluded house in Darien, Conn., where she edited her diaries and letters for publication. Mrs. Lindbergh's elder daughter, Anne Spencer Lindbergh, who was also a writer, died in 1993. In addition to her daughter Reeve, Mrs. Lindbergh  is survived by her sons Jon, Land and Scott.         Reeve Lindbergh had a baby son who died in 1985 at almost exactly the same age as Anne Morrow Lindbergh's firstborn. Reeve's baby was known as Jonny, and she wrote in her book: ''Jonny too died in the night, and I, like my mother before me, was apart from my son during his last moments. I too thought that the baby was safely asleep in his crib.''         Jonny's death, while he and his mother were staying with Anne Morrow Lindbergh in Connecticut, was caused by ''a seizure related to infant encephalitis,'' his mother wrote. When she went to wake him the next morning, he was dead. His body was already stiff and blue.         Reeve recalled that she and her mother made the necessary emergency telephone calls, and ''Then, because she insisted upon it, my mother and I went and sat together with Jonny's body, in two chairs, next to the crib where he had gone to sleep the night before.''         As they sat, Anne Morrow Lindbergh said: ''I never saw my child's body after he died. I never sat with my son this way.''         Seeking Balance Between Solitude and Communion         Here are some excerpts from Anne Morrow Lindbergh's books ''North to the Orient'' and ''Gift From the Sea'':         All afternoon we had flown over miles and miles of perfectly flat treeless land, mottled with lakes and marshes. Toward evening we came upon a gray glassy lake, bounded by gray bleak shores a little higher than the marshes. And on shore, the only points of accent in that monotonous landscape, stood three or four white houses. This was Baker Lake. We circled over the flagpole . . . the church steeple, and cut across the dull satin water of the lake to the little group of people on shore. As we pushed near the sandy bank I had a closer view of the land, gray again -- no trees, no hills, nothing but gray moss, gray water, and a gray sky. How could anything live there, even animals? For this was the trading post. . . .         My husband switched off the motor. The propeller clicked around idly and stopped. There was no noise except the lapping of our wash against the sand. The group of men on shore, a few white men, and Eskimos in pointed Santa Claus hoods, came forward. The Canadian mounted officer, tall and handsome in his red coat, put out a hand to us. ''We've reserved tickets for the show tonight. I hope you'll come!''         ''What's that?'' said my husband, not knowing whether to laugh or not, as he looked at the four lone houses. Great guffaws from the group.         When I jumped out, the three or four Eskimos drew back. Then two little Eskimo boys came up shyly and followed me about. Their bright eyes shone under their caps as they searched my face and costume curiously.         ''You see,'' explained one of the traders, ''you're the first white woman they've ever seen. There's never been one here before.''  -- From ''North to the Orient''  (1935, Harcourt, Brace)         To be a woman is to have interests and duties, raying out in all directions from the central mother-core, like spokes from the hub of a wheel. The pattern of our lives is essentially circular. We must be open to all points of the compass: husband, children, friends, home, community; stretched out, exposed, sensitive like a spider's web to each breeze that blows, to each call that comes. How difficult for us, then, to achieve a balance in the midst of these contradictory tensions, and yet how necessary for the proper functioning of our lives. How much we need, and how arduous of attainment is that steadiness preached in all rules for holy living. How desirable and how distant is the ideal of the contemplative, artist, or saint -- the inner inviolable core, the single eye.         With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in general run counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel.         What is the answer? There is no easy answer, no complete answer. I have only clues, shells from the sea. The bare beauty of the channelled whelk tells me that one answer, and perhaps a first step, is in simplification of life, in cutting out some of the distractions. But how? Total retirement is not possible, I cannot shed my responsiblities. I cannot permanently inhabit a desert island. I cannot be a nun in the midst of family life. I would not want to be. The solution for me, surely, is neither in total renunciation of the world, nor in total acceptance of it. I must find a balance somewhere, or an alternating rhythm between these two extremes; a swinging of the pendulum between solitude and communion, between retreat and return. In my periods of retreat, perhaps I can learn something to carry back into my worldly life. I can at least practice for these two weeks the simplification of outward life, as a beginning.  -- From ''Gift From the Sea''  (1955, Pantheon)       
         Dale Evans, who won the hearts of millions of Americans as she rode alongside her husband, Roy Rogers, in western films and on ''The Roy Rogers Show'' in the early years of television, died yesterday at her home in Apple Valley, Calif., east of Los Angeles. She was 88.         Miss Evans had not been on a horse since childhood and her hopes for a Hollywood career were sputtering when she was cast opposite John Wayne in her first Western, ''In Old Oklahoma,'' in 1944. She went on to become an accomplished sound-stage equestrienne, playing opposite rugged, handsome and likable cowboys in dozens of Westerns before she met and married Rogers, the King of the Cowboys, and composed the couple's enduring theme song, ''Happy Trails to You.''         By the 1950's she was a fixture on the sagebrush-epic landscape of snarling men, delicate ladies and roaring oil gushers. And with the dawn of television, she became a fixture in the minds of millions of children who tuned in to ''The Roy Rogers Show'' and saw her moseying  along on her buckskin horse, Buttermilk, while Rogers rode his beloved golden palomino, Trigger, the Smartest Horse in the Movies.         Miss Evans's break had come years earlier, while she was working as a $12-a-week stenographer in Dallas. While she was transcribing a letter, her boss suggested that she appear on a radio program that the company was sponsoring . She did, and soon was singing on regional radio hookups. By 1940 she was the featured performer on a CBS radio network program, ''News and Rhythm,'' and was heard on the Edgar Bergen-Charlie McCarthy program.         She was also appearing at the Gay Paree supper club in Chicago, where her showstopper was ''Will You Marry Me, Mr. Larramie?''         One night an agent offered not marriage but a screen test, opposite Bing Crosby in ''Holiday Inn.'' She did not get the part in the film, which also starred Fred Astaire and featured such Irving Berlin hits as ''White Christmas.'' But 20th Century-Fox signed her to a one-year contract.         She moved to Republic in 1943 and was cast opposite Wayne in ''In Old Oklahoma'' (it was later retitled ''The War of the Wildcats''), a romance about a swaggering, no-nonsense oil driller. The following year, she was cast in ''The Cowboy and the Señorita.''         The cowboy was Roy Rogers, a rugged, handsome and likable man but, by his own account, ''no great shakes'' as a talker.         Miss Evans was no señorita -- at the time, she was married to her second husband, Robert Dale Butts, a pianist. They divorced in 1945, and the following year, Rogers's wife died after giving birth to a son, Roy Rogers Jr.         Miss Evans and Rogers made eight films together in 1946, including ''My Pal Trigger.'' She admitted to having trouble with Trigger: she made the mistake of patting his neck.         ''He is a very highly cued horse,'' she said. ''He is cued to rear when you touch that spot on his neck. He stood straight up on his hind legs. I slipped off that dish I was sitting on, and fell flat on my -- I fell off in the dust.''         Her fans complained that Rogers seemed to care more about Trigger than he cared about her. ''How that spurious cowhand can be content to kiss a horse when he has Miss Evans on the lot every day I cannot imagine,'' Robert C. Ruark wrote in The World-Telegram in 1946, ''but the inflexible law of westerns is that the hero shall never smooch the heroine.''         Once, she said, he came close.  ''They were going to let Roy kiss me on the forehead'' in one film -- she said she could not remember which. The idea was to show that he was sorry for pushing her under a bed to keep her from getting hurt in a rough-and-tumble scene. ''But they had a conference and decided against it,'' she said. ''The kids, you know, so I never even got kissed on the forehead. I just get knocked under beds.''         Miss Evans wore outfits of fringes, satins and studs that were every bit as sartorially splendid as those sported by her husband. Thousands and thousands of red-blooded American girls wore Dale Evans outfits and cast-iron six shooters in their matching holster sets as a kind of proto-feminist reach for equality with their brothers.         Dale Evans -- born Frances Octavia Smith on Oct. 31, 1912, in Uvalde, Tex. -- once said that her favorite role was Toni Ames, a newspaperwoman in ''Don't Fence Me In,'' which was released in 1945. ''I like to be active in a role, and hate namby-pamby heroines,'' she said. ''Toni was a pleasant departure from the usual western role, in which the girl just stands around while men do violent and admirable things.''         Miss Evans appeared in the 1950's with the evangelist Billy Graham, and in the 1960's she joined a group of other actors in pressing for a constitutional amendment to permit prayer in public schools.         She also began writing inspirational books like ''Angel Unaware'' (Revell, 1953) the story of her daughter Robin, who was born in 1950 with Down syndrome and heart problems and died a few days before her second birthday. ''Angel Unaware'' sold 400,000 copies in two years; Miss Evans gave the profits to the National Association for Retarded Children.         Contrary to common practice at the time, when such children were institutionalized, and contrary to Hollywood myth making, in which fans were not to know that perfect couples sometimes had imperfect children, Miss Evans and Rogers had kept Robin, who was their first child, at home with the family.         It was a large family from the start. Rogers had been a widower with three children, an adopted daughter named Cheryl, a son, Roy  Jr., and another daughter, Linda Lou, and Miss Evans had a son, Thomas Frederick Fox Jr., from an earlier marriage that she had entered into when she was 14. To help them overcome their grief over the death of Robin, the couple adopted a Korean War orphan they named Deborah Lee.         On Aug. 17, 1964, Deborah Lee, then 12 years old, was killed in a church bus-car collision near Oceanside, Calif. The following year, John David (Sandy) Rogers, an abused child whom they adopted after one of their many goodwill visits to an orphanage, choked to death in a military hospital in Germany. An 18-year-old Army private, he had complained of feeling ill after dining at an enlisted men's club. After he died, Miss Evans wrote a book, ''Salute to Sandy.''         They also raised a foster child from Scotland, Marion Fleming, and a Choctaw Indian child, Mary Little Doe, called Dodie.         Roy Rogers died in 1998 at age 86.         Roy Rogers Jr. runs the Roy Rogers and Dale Evans Museum in Victorville, Calif., at the edge of the Mojave Desert and seven miles from the Rogers-Evans ranch, named the Double-R Bar Ranch like the one in their television series.         There, amid all the memorabilia of a time in America when the good guys were polite singing cowboys who wore white hats and fought fairly and never cussed, is a glass case holding a stuffed Trigger, together with Miss Evans's horse Buttermilk and the couple's German shepherd, Bullet.         At the peak of their popularity in the late 1940's and early 50's, Roy Rogers and Dale Evans had more than 2,000 fan clubs around the world and hundreds of licensed products from lunchboxes to comic books bore their names and faces.         Their rodeo set a box-office record at Madison Square Garden and they were the only couple to be chosen grand marshals of the annual Tournament of Roses parade in Pasadena, Calif.         Miss Evans had almost as many credits for songwriting as she did for acting. She wrote or composed more than 25 songs, including ''Aha, San Antone,'' which sold more than 200,000 copies, and ''The Bible Tells Me So.'' She made 30 children's records, . including one that featured her own songs, ''Happy Birthday, Gentle Savior.''         ''I would love to be an evangelist,'' Miss Evans said, ''but I think God has revealed to me that I can serve him best by just remaining at my post.''         Correction:  February 10, 2001, Saturday  An obituary of the film and television star Dale Evans on Thursday  misstated the name of the Chicago supper club where she performed in the early 1940's. It was Chez Paree, not Gay Paree.       
         Pauline Koner, one of the eclectic individualists of contemporary American dance, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         A choreographer noted for powerful solos, Miss Koner was also a principal dancer with the José Limón Dance Company, a leading modern-dance troupe of the 1940's and 50's. Stylistically versatile, she contributed to early television dance, taught dance around the world and choreographed stage shows at the Roxy Theater in New York and several ice revues. Although usually categorized as a modern dancer, she was fond of saying, ''I never had a modern-dance lesson in my life.''         She was born in New York in 1912,  the daughter of immigrants from Russia. Her father, Samuel Koner, a lawyer, had devised a medical plan for the Workmen's Circle, a Jewish socialist and benevolent organization; the result is considered a pioneering group medical plan.         Interested in the arts, Miss Koner wanted to study ballet with Michel Fokine, the most important balletic reformer of the early 20th century.  Her family considered his fees exorbitant, so her father offered his legal services free to Fokine in exchange for ballet lessons for young Pauline.         Miss Koner also studied Spanish dance and worked with Michio Ito and Yeichi Nimura, Japanese choreographers who blended Asian dance with Western modern dance.         Discussing her training in her autobiography, ''Solitary Song'' (Duke University Press, 1989), Miss Koner said she derived her speed and precision from ballet, her smoothness in covering space from Asian dance and her rhythm and dynamics from Spanish dance.         She presented her first solo concert on Dec. 7, 1930, and John Martin, then the dance critic for The New York Times, said that the event ''exhibited her unquestionable right to stand alone.'' He added, ''She can build a dance far better than the average, she can perform it with complete authority.''         Miss Koner toured Egypt and Palestine in 1932 and taught and performed in the Soviet Union from 1934 to 1936. Her solos then included  works on biblical themes, the ''Suite of Soviet Impressions,'' the satirical ''Three Funeral Marches'' and dances in Spanish and Arabian styles.         Miss Koner's career often took unexpected turns. In the early 40's she created dances for the Roxy and for ''Holiday on Ice.'' She began to choreograph for CBS television in 1945, experimenting with effects that only a camera could produce.         The most important change in her artistic development came that year  when, after a solo concert, she received a note from Doris Humphrey, the legendary American modern dance pioneer.         Humphrey praised the program, yet added criticism that Miss Koner found so perceptive that she sought out Humphrey and asked her to be her adviser, her ''outside eye,'' as she called her. Thereafter, Miss Koner would submit all her new choreography to Humphrey for comment. ''Our work together was a continuous revelation,'' she wrote in her autobiography, and added that after Humphrey's death in 1958: ''She inhabits me. She is my dybbuk.''         Martin declared in The Times in 1955 that, by working with Humphrey, Miss Koner ''has arrived at her true fulfillment'' and that the decision to ally herself with a mentor ''was an act of high artistic insight.'' Miss Koner honored Humphrey's memory in 1962 with ''The Farewell,'' an elegiac 30-minute solo that became her best-known piece of choreography.         Humphrey served as the artistic adviser to the Limón company and she and Limón asked Miss Koner to perform with the troupe. As a result, she became what she termed ''a permanent guest artist'' with the company from 1946 to 1960, creating roles in such major works as Limón's ''Moor's Pavane'' (1949) and Humphrey's ''Ruins and Visions'' (1953).         At the same time, she choreographed for herself and other dancers with productions ranging in tone from ''Cassandra'' (1953), a warning against hysteria, to the gracious ''Concertino'' (1955). From 1976 to 1982 she headed the Pauline Koner Dance Consort.         Petite, with dark hair and eyes,  Miss Koner riveted audiences with her intensity. She designed many of her stage costumes and was always strikingly dressed offstage. Reviewing a Limón concert for Dance magazine in 1955, the critic Doris Hering wrote that ''Pauline Koner was like some fiery bacchante as she tore through leaps and sharp shifts in direction.''         Yet however spontaneous her dancing may have seemed, Miss Koner believed that the principles of stage presence and theatrical magnetism could be learned. She became famous for Elements of Performing, a course she taught at the North Carolina School of the Arts, the American Dance Festival and other schools in the United States, Europe and Asia. The course analyzed such facets of a performance as motivation, emotion, focus, dynamics and the use of props, fabrics, lights and sound.         Miss Koner was married to the conductor Fritz Mahler from 1939 until his death in 1973. She received a Dance Magazine Award in 1964 and wrote for many dance publications.         No immediate family members survive.         Correction:  February 12, 2001, Monday  An obituary of the dancer Pauline Koner on Friday referred incorrectly to the José Limón Dance Company, in which she was a principal in the 1940's and 50's. It remains a leading modern-dance company; its prominence was not limited to those decades.       
         Inna Zubkovskaya, a leading ballerina in the Kirov Ballet when that Russian company first appeared in the West, died on Feb. 5 in St. Petersburg, Russia. She was 77.         The Kirov was at a peak but unfamiliar to ballet audiences throughout the world until 1961. Ms. Zubkovskaya led the troupe in its United States debut when she appeared in the dual role of Odette-Odile in ''Swan Lake'' at the Kirov's opening night on Sept. 11, 1961, at the Metropolitan Opera House.         The company had performed a few months earlier in Paris, where it was rocked by Rudolf Nureyev's defection but continued on to London for its British debut. The depth of dancing at that time proved that the company from St. Petersburg was dependent on no single star but had an array of distinguished ballerinas, a stunning corps and other male dancers of superstar caliber like Yuri Soloviev.         Ms. Zubkovskaya belonged to the heroic generation of Soviet dancers that was responsible for the Kirov's impact in the West and who was deeply admired at home. She was prominent in the London season, where she was praised for her range and the mix of sweep and bravura in her classical style. Writing from London, John Martin of The New York Times called her Odette ''beautifully lyrical, always with a dramatic tone beneath the surface.''         Ms. Zubkovskaya was born Inna Izraelyeva in Moscow, where she graduated in 1941 from the Bolshoi Ballet school. Invited to join the Kirov, she danced with that company until 1970, performing in the classics and the premieres of major Soviet ballets including Leonid Jakobson's version of ''Spartacus'' and Yuri Grigorovich's ''Legend of Love.'' She had continued to work as a teacher and coach until her death.         She was married twice to fellow dancers, first to Nikolai Zubkovsky and then to Sviatoslav Kuznetsov.       
         Helen Smith Bevington, a poet, essayist, English professor and tireless tourist who roamed the world in search of her own Shangri-La, died on Friday at the home of her son, David, in Chicago. She was 94.         Mrs. Bevington was a professor emeritus at Duke University, where she joined the faculty in 1943 and retired in 1976. She was the author of 12 books of poetry and essays, including her last book, published in 1996, ''The Third and Only Way: Reflections on Staying Alive.''         A writer of light verse and memoirs that plumbed her own life, Mrs. Bevington wrote about her world travels, her romance and marriage to her husband, Merle M. Bevington, and even the small-town love affairs of her Methodist minister father.         Her memoir ''Charley Smith's Girl'' was banned by the library in Worcester, N.Y., where she grew up. And to interviewers, Mrs. Bevington professed delight with the censure of her book, which described how her mother divorced her father for carrying on with younger female parishioners.         ''It's a place dear to me,'' she told an interviewer. ''It's an honor to be banned there. Nobody gets banned.''         Born in Afton, N.Y., she earned her philosophy degree from the University of Chicago and a master's degree in English from Columbia University. There she met her husband in a class in romanticism in 1927. They married, saved up $1,500 to travel and roamed the globe until they returned to New York to face the stock market crash in 1929.         Eventually the couple settled in Durham, N.C., where her husband also joined the Duke University faculty. In addition to her son, she is survived by five grandchildren.         In her 70's she traveled the world again, writing about her quixotic quest ''in search of something -- call it a bo tree, or Shangri-La, or earthly paradise -- which is only another name for peace itself and these days is decidedly a fool's errand.''       
         Toby Wing, whose pert good looks and vivacious personality made her a cinematic bombshell of the 30's -- as well as the heroine in a storybook romance with a celebrated aviator, Dick Merrill -- died on Friday at her home in Mathews, Va. She was 85.         ''Miss Wing is a nice girl with a face like the morning sun,'' The New York World Telegram proclaimed in 1937.         Starting in 1931, when she was 16, she made 38 movies in little more than a decade, becoming America's favorite pinup from Jean Harlow's death in 1937 until Betty Grable led G.I.'s to World War II in a swimsuit.         Miss Wing, her platinum hair shining brilliantly, was the original Goldwyn Girl, the first of Samuel Goldwyn's one-to-a-picture sex symbols, appearing in ''Palmy Days'' in 1932. She also appeared in Busby Berkeley's lavish musicals and in no time was getting roles requiring no small dash of sexual innuendo.         In the 1937 film ''True Confession,'' she was a secretary being interrogated by a lawyer, played by Fred MacMurray. The lawyer asks her to take shorthand, perhaps to see if she can or, more likely, to prove a point. Miss Wing stares back and says, ''Are you kidding?''         At the time, Paramount said she was receiving more fan mail than either Marlene Dietrich or Claudette Colbert, and she had carved out a highly visible niche.         ''She was a sex symbol, let's face it,'' said her nephew William H. Perry Jr.         But almost as suddenly as the shooting star flew, it crashed to earth. In 1940, the baby she had with Mr. Merrill died in his crib, and the couple moved to Florida to raise their second son in privacy. She made only one more film, ''The Marines Come Through,'' in 1943.         Some of her work was uncredited, and not a few of her parts were small, but she left behind moments that are treasured by film enthusiasts. It was to her, wearing a white fox bra above a bare midriff, that Dick Powell in sang ''Young and Healthy'' in the original ''42nd Street,'' in 1933.         Her publicity pictures were an industry in themselves. She posed, in succession, with at least five fiancés. She balanced on pyramids of rubber balls, and in one particularly inspired moment she was pictured saving a co-star from imminent death by drowning.         Once, she visited West Point, where she promised a cadet a signed photograph in return for a pair of cadet pajamas.         The pajamas arrived, and according to The Daily News, they were made of Mandarin silk with hand-embroidered flowers. Whether she reciprocated with a picture seems to have gone unreported.         She dated, or at least was said by the movie magazines to date, Maurice Chevalier, Alfred Vanderbilt and Franklin Roosevelt Jr. But it was her romance with Henry Tindall Merrill, known as Dick, that captured the national imagination. Mr. Merrill was the first aviator to fly a trans-Atlantic round trip and established such a record of safety on the La Guardia-to-Miami route for Eastern Airlines that be became known as New York's favorite pilot.         Not to say that Mr. Merrill was the first aviator to whom she was publicly linked. The New York American in 1936 told of her sorrow at the death of an army aviator with whom she had ''an understanding'' that marriage was imminent. She said in the article that the actor Jackie Coogan, another boyfriend, had been furious that the aviator had given her his West Point ring.         The next year, she told The Daily News that she was done with men. ''I have really given up falling in love with men!'' she said. ''Oh yes! My career is now to be my life.''         Six months later, The New York Herald Tribune carried a short item speculating that she was about to marry Mr. Merrill. The newspaper said she ''shook her blond tresses'' and said, ''You never can tell.'' They eloped to Tijuana 11 months later.         Martha Virginia Wing was born in Amelia Court House, Va., on July 14, 1915. Toby is an old family nickname.         She is survived by her sister, Patricia Gill of Gloucester, Va., and two granddaughters. Mr. Merrill and their second son, Richard, both died in 1982.       
         Birgit Akesson, a dancer and choreographer whose unconventional approach to movement and music made her a prominent pioneer of Swedish modern dance, died on Saturday in Stockholm, where she lived. She died on her 93rd birthday.         Unlike most modern dancers in the United States and Europe in the 1930's and 40's, Ms. Akesson was less concerned with expressing emotion than with finding the essence of dance through form. She rebelled early against her Expressionist training and became known for pure and rigorous solos, often performed without music.         Although she stopped dancing in 1965, Ms. Akesson's role as a founding mother of Swedish modern dance was increasingly recognized in the last 30 years, and she was awarded the gold medal of the Swedish Academy in 1998. Her works were seen on Swedish television, and her pure-dance aesthetic found favor with a new generation of viewers. A founder of the Choreographic Institute in Stockholm, she was an expert on dance in Asia and also Africa, where she sought the roots of a dance culture absent in the West.         In the 1950's she choreographed several works for the Royal Swedish Ballet as well as a space age opera, ''Aniara,'' that was typical of her collaboration with Sweden's modernist composers and poets. Yet her signature style was not dramatic and narrative. Ahead of her time, she sometimes baffled the international dance world with experiments in stillness, a dissociation between music and movement and her uncanny ability to reshape the body into an assemblage of independent planes.         In Paris, where she had made her debut in 1934, this reconfiguring of the body reminded critics of Cubist forms, and Ms. Akesson was called ''the Picasso of Dance.'' American audiences saw her perform in New York (1949 and 1955), and at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival (1955) and the American Dance Festival (1956). Referring to the slow pace or static quality of some of her solos, the American critic George Beiswanger wrote that she would occasionally ''crawl and writhe like a slug or an upended caterpillar, hardly moving at all.'' But he added, ''If one lets the movement have its way, it generates a compelling, almost hypnotic beauty.''         Ms. Akesson was born in Malmo, Sweden. From 1929 to 1931, she studied in Dresden at the school of Mary Wigman, the German modern dance pioneer. Although she and Birgit Cullberg, who was considered the other founding mother of Swedish modern dance, had their roots in German Expressionist dance, Ms. Akesson did not share Ms. Cullberg's interest in ballet or dance-drama.         In search of her own dance idiom and what she called a first or primary movement that did not depend on music, she moved to Paris, where she presented a solo concert in 1934. Two years later she opened a school in Stockholm, where she concentrated on developing an idiom that would allow each part of the body to move independently.         ''All parts of her dancing body were granted equal importance,'' Horace Engdahl wrote in ''Swedish Ballet and Dance'' (Swedish Institute, 1992). ''This was coupled with a new idea of space as growing out of the movement instead of being a fixed theatrical frame.'' He added that the body ''seemed to be taken apart and reassembled in forever new shapes, dissolving into a continuous flow of images growing one out of the other.''         Molding herself into a sculptural shape with her head or shoulder sometimes resting on the floor, Ms. Akesson often danced with eyes closed. In 1946 she returned to performing with two solos that were considered an artistic breakthrough, ''Blue Evening'' and ''Movement.''         Ms. Akesson began to collaborate with the poet Erik Lindegren and the composer Karl-Birger Blomdahl in works like ''Eye: Sleep in Dream'' (1953). Mr. Lindegren's poem was heard before Ms. Akesson moved in silence, with the music played during blackouts between the danced passages.         Ms. Akesson often turned to the same collaborators for the seven large works, beginning with the 1957 ''Sisyphus,'' that she choreographed for the Royal Swedish Ballet.         In 1983 she published her highly acclaimed book on African culture, ''The Mask of Spring Water,'' and suddenly returned to choreography in 1989 by creating two solos on television. Long interested in Asian dance, she chose the Chinese-born dancer Chiang Ching to perform both dances, ''Autumn Leaves'' and ''Shades.''         Ms. Akesson is survived by a daughter, Mona Moeller-Nilesen, and a grandchild.       
         Margaret Tafoya, whose nimble, ingenious hands turned the chocolate-colored clay of her New Mexico pueblo into black-on-black and red-on-red pottery of such profound and graceful beauty that it acquired a global reputation, died on Feb. 25 at her home in Santa Clara Pueblo near Santa Fe. She was 96.         Her name in Tewa, the language of seven Southwestern pueblos, six in New Mexico and one in Arizona, was Corn Blossom. She was the matriarch of Santa Clara Pueblo potters, who are more numerous and produce more pottery than those of any other pueblo.         Her work, known for exceptionally large vessels, is exhibited in public and private collections around the world. She was named folk artist of the year by the National Endowment for the Arts in 1984.         The art form she practiced has long been dominated by women, and Corn Blossom was the last of a group of women who attained fame through their mastery of it. Gone are Blue Corn and Maria Martinez of the San Ildefonso Pueblo, Christina Naranjo of Santa Clara and Grace Chapella, a Hopi.         Today Indian arts command astronomic prices and space on museum shelves in faraway cities, but fewer and fewer Pueblo Indians can speak or even understand Tewa. Mrs. Tafoya, though, was rooted in the old ways.         She spurned inventions like the potter's wheel. She kept chickens, milked her own cows, churned her own butter and rejected natural gas heat in favor of the traditional beehive fireplace.         After a brief fling with an Apache, she married a young man from the home pueblo, a distant relative with the same last name.         According to the Web site of the National Museum of American History (www.americanhistory.si.edu), Santa Clarans use the same word for clay and for people: nung.         Mrs. Tafoya always prayed to Mother Clay before working. ''You can't go to Mother Clay without the cornmeal and ask her permission to touch her,'' the museum Web site quotes Mrs. Tafoya as saying. ''Talk to Mother Clay.''         Though she was one of the last to make pots with handles and criticized others for adding semiprecious gems to pottery, she also liked to experiment.         She used different colors of slips, or thinned clays applied to the outside of her vessels, and her later forms were thinner, lighter and more graceful. Her shiny finishes became ever more polished. She even adapted Greek and Roman forms to classic Santa Clara shapes.         Mrs. Tafoya clearly loved her art, but it was also how she supported her 10 children who survived their first year; 2 others did not. As she said, ''I have dressed my children with clay.''         Maria Margarita Tafoya was born in her pueblo on Aug. 13, 1904. Her mother, Sara Fina Gutierrez Tafoya, or Autumn Leaf, was ''undoubtedly the outstanding Tewa potter of her time,'' Mary Ellen and Laurence Blair wrote in ''Margaret Tafoya: A Tewa Potter's Heritage and Legacy'' (Schiffer, 1986).         Her father, Geronimo, or White Flower, was mainly concerned with raising food for the family, but he was also the main marketer of his wife's pottery. He would load up his burros and make sales trips of up to 500 miles.         Five of the couple's eight children became excellent potters, driven and inspired by their perfectionist mother. Margaret's rigidly traditional approach was suggested by her insistence on using corn cobs, rather than sandpaper, for polishing.         She and her siblings made their first pottery when their mother tossed them pieces of clay. ''We get a piece of her clay and try to make animals or maybe bowls,'' Margaret said. ''We make these just for fun.''         Her mother allowed the young girl to sell her first piece of pottery to a Santa Fe dealer. ''I sure don't remember how much I got,'' she said in an interview in the book. ''It was a small piece, you know. It made me feel good. I felt I should make some more.''         Margaret attended the pueblo elementary school and went to Santa Fe Indian School.         She had to drop out of high school to help her family during the devastating flu epidemic of 1918. In 1924 she married Alcario Tafoya, a professional cook who was also related to famous potters. He carved decorations on Margaret's works but never signed them.         In the 1930's and 40's the Tafoyas often exchanged pottery for children's clothing. Mrs. Tafoya returned to work as soon as possible after the birth of each of her children.         At first she and her husband took her pottery to cities and fairs to sell. Then, tourists arrived in buses and cars to buy it directly. In the 1950's the family become friends with the owner of a resort at Royal Gorge on the front range of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. He persuaded them to be resident Indians each summer. They would dance and sell pottery.         As the value of Indian art skyrocketed, such direct selling was no longer necessary. Dealers today place blind orders for anything they can get by the best-known potters. But Mrs. Tafoya enjoyed attending group shows simply to see what others were doing.         In 1977 she visited a gallery show in Santa Fe that included 51 potters from 11 tribes. Afterward she invited the great Hopi potter Grace Chapella, then 103, to her home. The two conversed in old Tewa, which is to today's Tewa what Elizabethan English is to modern English.         ''The Tafoya daughters were told that it was rude to interrupt with questions, so they missed much of the conversation,'' the Blairs said in their book.         Mrs. Tafoya once said that she learned to make pottery ''just by watching my Grandma,'' and most of her own children and grandchildren learned the same way.         She is survived by six daughters, Virginia Ebelacker, Jennie Trammel, Toni Roller, LuAnn Tafoya, Mary Esther Archuleta and Shirley Tafoya; three sons, Leonardo, Wayne and Phillip; 30 grandchildren; 45 great-grandchildren; and 11 great-great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Tafoya never used the words ''when I die,'' saying instead, ''if I die.''         And she does live, in clay and in blood. ''The children, I'm proud of them because they like to do this pottery,'' she said.       
         Ann Sothern, a deft comedian and talented singer who was known as the Queen of the B's at Columbia and RKO, where she made 18 movies between 1934 and 1936, died on Thursday at her home in Ketchum, Idaho. She was 92.         Perhaps never the star she might have been, Ms. Sothern was nevertheless one of the shrewdest actresses around. Her astuteness would eventually lead to her ownership of two early television series, ''Private Secretary'' and ''The Ann Sothern Show.''         In 1938 Ms. Sothern ditched her blond ingénue image and stormed Hollywood's greatest studio, MGM, only to be stuck in a wildly successful series of 10 movies about a tough, scatterbrained, down-on-her-luck Brooklyn chorus girl with a heart of gold, Maisie Ravier.         ''Maisie'' (1939), which had been bought for Jean Harlow and then shelved when Harlow died, was an instant phenomenon. Letters addressed to ''Maisie, U.S.A.'' had no trouble being delivered. After ''Congo Maisie'' (1940), ''Gold Rush Maisie'' (1940), ''Ringside Maisie'' (1941) and ''Maisie Was a Lady'' (1941) and between ''Swing Shift Maisie'' (1943) and ''Undercover Maisie'' (1947), Ms. Sothern begged the studio head, Louis B. Mayer, to allow her to quit the series. Mr. Mayer always answered: ''No. Your movies pay for our mistakes.''         Through bad luck or fate, Ms. Sothern was never more than a minor star: ''a Hollywood princess,'' she once said, ''not a Hollywood queen.''         Joseph Mankiewicz, the Academy Award-winning director who cast Ms. Sothern in her best role, as the soap opera-writing wife of Kirk Douglas in ''A Letter to Three Wives'' (1949), said of her: ''Poor Annie. Annie was a damned good Broadway musical comedy actress.  She had the sexiest mouth any woman ever had. But, at Metro, poor Annie got stuck in the Sam Katz unit.  She never got the big break Gene Kelly and others did, of being with the Arthur Freed steamroller of talent.''         Ms. Sothern got a few chances to show off her her talent, her timing and her figure in MGM musicals, most notably ''Lady Be Good'' (1941) and in the Ethel Merman role in the film version of the Cole Porter musical comedy ''Panama Hattie'' (1942). And she got good reviews as a hard-boiled ex-waitress pressed into service as a nurse and doomed when the island of Bataan was conquered by the Japanese in the World War II drama ''Cry Havoc'' (1943). But it would be 35 years after ''Cry Havoc'' before she earned her sole Academy Award nomination.         In 1988, at the age of 79, she was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for her performance as Lillian Gish's optimistic friend and neighbor in the 1987 drama of old age, ''The Whales of August.''         A few months before the nominations were announced, Ms. Sothern told an interviewer that her chances were dismal. ''I think Hollywood has been terrible to me,'' she said. ''Hollywood doesn't respond to a strong woman, not at all. I was too independent. How dare a woman be competitive or produce her own shows?''         Like her friend Lucille Ball, Ms. Sothern turned early to television. In  their B-movie days at RKO, the two actresses had cried on each other's  shoulders, with Ms. Sothern complaining that she got all the roles Katharine Hepburn did not want and Ms. Ball saying that she got all the parts Ms. Sothern did not want.         Ms. Sothern was savvy enough to produce ''Private Secretary,'' and to demand that the situation comedy be shot on film, to preserve it. As Susie McNamera, private secretary to a New York talent agent, Ms. Sothern became a heroine to secretaries all over America. The show alternated Sunday nights on CBS with ''The Jack Benny Show'' from February 1953 to September 1957.         When Ms. Sothern quarreled with the show's other producer over her right to take on movie roles, she left the series and sold her 104 episodes for well over $1 million. She immediately returned to CBS in ''The Ann Sothern Show'' as the assistant manager of a swanky New York hotel.  Lucille Ball, as Lucy Ricardo, was a guest star on the first episode, and Ms. Sothern returned the favor several times as the Countess Framboise on ''I Love Lucy.'' In 1989, 28 years after ''The Ann Sothern Show'' went off the air, the actress sold the rights to the cable channel Nickelodeon, where the show became an unexpected hit.         Ann Sothern was born Harriette Lake on Jan. 22, 1909, in Valley City, N.D., where her mother, a concert singer, was on tour. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Walter and Annette Yde-Lake. Of Danish stock, she was raised in Minnesota by her mother and grandmother after her father, a meat salesman and womanizer, deserted the family when she was 5.         At 16 she was named the outstanding high school composer in Minnesota and sent to Detroit to represent Minnesota in a national contest. She spent a year at the University of Washington before joining her mother, who was a singing teacher in Hollywood. When half a dozen bit parts in movies got her nowhere, she tried Broadway with somewhat more success.         Florenz Ziegfeld offered her a part in ''Smiles'' with Marilyn Miller, but the star considered the 20-year-old Ms. Sothern too much competition and had her fired after the Boston tryout. In 1931 she played the ingenue in ''Everybody's Welcome,'' the play that introduced the song ''As Time Goes By''; she then toured for seven months in the George S. Kaufman-Morrie Ryskind-Ira and George Gershwin musical ''Of Thee I Sing.''  After the tour ended she took over the same role on Broadway, replacing Lois Moran. And Hollywood noticed.         She was signed by Columbia Studios, which changed her name to Ann Sothern and her hair color from red to platinum blond. From ''Let's Fall in Love'' in 1933 through ''The Hell Cat,'' ''Blind Date'' and ''Kid Millions'' with Eddie Cantor in 1934, the Maurice Chevalier musical ''Folies-Bergère'' in 1935 and a dozen more lightweight but pleasant musicals and comedies, she bubbled and sang.         Married to the bandleader Rogert Pryor and living in a huge rented house in Beverly Hills, she decided she had had enough of B movies. ''I found a much smaller house in Hollywood,'' she recalled. ''We lived cautiously, not as extravagantly, for a year. I was just so sick of those pictures, I decided I wasn't going to do them anymore.''         After making seven movies in 1937, she was off the screen until 1939, when she returned with fourth billing in an A movie, MGM's ''Trade Winds,'' as Fredric March's manipulative secretary. When he saw ''Trade Winds,'' Walter Ruben, the producer of ''Maisie,'' refused to cast one of MGM's contract actresses as Maisie; he insisted on Ann Sothern for the role that would define her career for the next decade.         In 1950, with her MGM contract coming to an end, she collapsed on the ski slopes at Sun Valley, Idaho, with a near-fatal case of hepatitis and was in and out of hospitals for a year. She had divorced Pryor in 1942. In 1943 she married the actor Robert Sterling and had a daughter. That marriage also ended in divorce.         Her movie career was essentially over, too, although she had solid parts in Gore Vidal's satirical political drama, ''The Best Man,'' and the Olivia de Havilland thriller ''Lady in a Cage,'' both in 1964. In 1965 she played her most bizarre role, as the voice of the mother of Jerry Van Dyke reincarnated as a 1928 Porter automobile in the television series ''My Mother the Car.''         Like many former stars she turned eventually to summer stock and dinner theater, with disastrous results. In 1974 on a stage in Jacksonville, Fla., falling scenery broke her back and smashed the nerves in her legs. She finished the performance, held together with silver gaffer's tape.         Told she would probably never walk again, she refused to accept the diagnosis. Immensely athletic, she was a crack trap shooter and deep sea fisherman, and her MGM contract gave her three months off each winter to ski in Sun Valley. She never came to terms with what the accident had done to her body. But she did walk, with a cane that she used reluctantly and constantly misplaced. And, a decade after the accident, she moved out of Southern California to Ketchum, where she could see Dollar Mountain, which she used to ski, through the window of her house.         A different kind of accident brought her one more chance for glory. The producer of a television remake of ''A Letter to Three Wives'' thought it would be a great marketing ploy to get one of the original stars, Jeanne Crain or Ms. Sothern, to play a cameo role. Ms. Sothern's bit part let Lindsay Anderson, the director who would be making ''The Whales of August,'' know that Ms. Sothern was still alive.         Mr. Anderson had retained ''a memory of her charm'' from Ms. Sothern's early musicals. ''In a sense she was too good an actress to be a star,'' he said. ''Being a star requires elephantiasis of the ego.''         Ms. Sothern is survived by her  daughter, Tisha Sterling, an actress and designer; a sister, Sally Adams of Boise, Idaho; and a granddaughter.         Summing up her career after ''The Whales of August,'' Ms. Sothern shook her graying gold ringlets and said, ''I've done everything but play rodeos.''         Correction:  March 20, 2001, Tuesday  An obituary of the actress Ann Sothern on Saturday misidentified the distributor of ''Trade Winds,'' a 1938 film in which she played a supporting role. It was United Artists, not MGM.         Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the television show on which she appeared as the Countess Framboise. It was ''The Lucy Show,'' not ''I Love Lucy.''       
         Eleanor Clymer, who in dozens of children's books contrasted country and city life, died yesterday at a retirement community in Haverford, Pa. She was 95.         Between 1943 and 1983, Mrs. Clymer published 58 books, mostly for elementary schoolchildren. Her first, ''A Yard for John,'' which told of a city boy who so longs to play in the mud and grass that his family moves to the suburbs, was praised in The New York Times as a story of reality ''touched with magic.'' In ''The Trolley Car Family'' (1947), a man who loses his job as a street car driver turns his old trolley into a home for his family and moves it to the country.         But Mrs. Clymer also explored the lives of children who stay in the city in books like ''My Brother Stevie'' (1967), about a troubled third grader,  and ''The Tiny Little House'' (1964), inspired by a small house that she saw squeezed between two tall buildings in Manhattan. The story was later adapted into a musical for children, ''The Little House of Cookies.''         Whether set in the city or the country, Mrs. Clymer's stories were grounded in reality, despite a children's book industry enthralled with fantasy. ''No 'Star Wars' and dungeons or dragons and fairy tales,'' she said firmly of her writing in an interview in 1984.         One book, ''Hamburgers -- and Ice Cream for Dessert'' (1975), about a boy searching for food on a desert island, was inspired by her son, Adam, who for a time as a child would eat for dinner only hamburgers, mashed potatoes and peas, and ice cream. Adam Clymer, her only survivor, is now the Washington correspondent of The Times.         Mrs. Clymer originally wanted to be a science writer, and several of her books sought to teach children about subjects like archaeology.         ''She always came up with an interesting idea which no one else had done,'' said Ann Durell, the former publisher of children's books at Dutton, who edited Mrs. Clymer.         Eleanor Lowenton was born in New York City on Jan. 7, 1906, to Russian immigrant parents. She spent most of her life in New York, but in an essay in the ''Something About the Author Autobiography Series'' in 1994, she fondly recalled how she explored the land around her family's tarpaper-covered summer home in New Jersey, and how disappointed she was when her parents had to give up plans to live there permanently because her father could not find a job. The yearning for the country, she said, ''was to influence all our lives.''         After earning a degree in English from the University of Wisconsin in 1928, and marrying Kinsey Clymer, a journalist who became a social worker, she tried to return to country life. She and her family put a down payment on a farm and began repairs, but finances again got in the way, and the Clymers returned to the city.         After taking a workshop at the Bank Street School, Mrs. Clymer decided to try writing for the young.         ''I wanted to tell stories to little children, like my own son and his friends who were beginning to find their way in the everyday world of family, play, work, pets, familiar things that they experienced and understood,'' she recalled.         For the next few decades, she did just that, sometimes so prolifically that she published under pseudonyms so that she would not appear to be competing with herself.         Finally, after their son was grown, the Clymers realized their dream of a country house. In the early 1960's they moved to Katonah, N.Y., in Westchester County, where Mr. Clymer died in 1984, and Mrs. Clymer lived until 1989.       
         Josephine Premice, an actress nominated for Tony Awards for her performances in the musical ''Jamaica'' and ''A Hand Is on the Gate,'' an evening of black poetry, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was emphysema.         Ms. Premice, whose married name was Fales, also starred on Broadway from 1976 to 1977 in the musical ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.'' Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Clive Barnes wrote that Ms. Premice ''can almost make a feather boa come alive.'' Her other Broadway appearances included ''Mister Johnson'' in 1956, a play about Nigeria by Norman Rosten, based on the novel by Joyce Cary.         Writing about Ms. Premice's 1957 performance in ''Jamaica,'' which starred Lena Horne, the Times dance critic Jennifer Dunning described her as ''a razzle-dazzle lead performer who was hot flame to Horne's cool fire.''         ''A Hand Is on the Gate'' moved in 1966 to the Longacre Theater from the New York Shakespeare Festival, where it originated under the title ''An Evening of Poetry and Folk Music of American Negroes.'' Ms. Premice worked frequently for Joseph Papp, appearing in an all-black production of ''Electra'' for the Shakespeare Festival's mobile theater, which toured the city's boroughs in 1969.         She was also in the festival's 1973 production of ''The Cherry Orchard,'' directed by James Earl Jones.         Ms. Premice was in the original cast of ''House of Flowers,'' a musical comedy by Truman Capote that was choreographed by George Balanchine and featured Pearl Bailey, Juanita Hall and Diahann Carroll. She left the production before it moved from Philadelphia to Broadway, but appeared in an Off Broadway revival of the play in 1968.         On television, she was a frequent  guest on ''The Merv Griffin Show'' and a guest star on the sitcom ''A Different World.'' She also played Louise Jefferson's sister on ''The Jeffersons'' and appeared on ''The Cosby Show.''         Born in Brooklyn in 1926 to Haitian parents, Ms. Premice grew up in New York and Haiti and studied dance with Martha Graham and Katherine Dunham. She began her theatrical career in the 1945 production of ''Blue Holiday'' at the Belasco Theater alongside Ethel Waters and Josh White, the folk singer.         Ms. Premice's final stage performance was as Amanda Wingfield in the first professional all-black production of Tennessee Williams's ''Glass Menagerie'' at the Cleveland Playhouse in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, Capt. Timothy Fales of Paris; a son,  Enrico Fales; a daughter, Susan Fales-Hill; and a sister, Adele Premice, all of New York.       
         Alice M. Gritsavage, who was chief nurse of the Far East command during the Korean War and Gen. Douglas MacArthur's nursing consultant, died on Monday in Daytona Beach, Fla. She was 98.         In the Korean War, Ms. Gritsavage revolutionized the command structure of the Army Nursing Corps, obtaining hospital supplies when equipment was scarce and helping get the military to commission male nurses on an equal footing with women.         At the time male nurses were drafted as enlisted men but were forbidden to be commissioned with their female counterparts because the Army thought that nursing was for women only.         Her insistence that these men serve on an equal footing led to an effort to discharge her, which was stopped by General MacArthur, then commander of the American forces in the Far East. She was the only woman on the general's staff.         Reared in Glen Lyon, Pa., Ms. Gritsavage received her nurse's training at King's County Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y., earned a pharmacist degree from Temple University in Philadelphia and a master's degree in nursing administration from Incarnate Word College in San Antonio.         She joined the Army in November 1942 and during World War II served in Africa, France and Italy.         Ms. Gritsavage received many medals and citations, including the Bronze Star and two Legion of Merit awards. She retired as a colonel in 1962 after 20 years of service, and became a vocal spokeswoman for veterans' affairs.         The Korean War Veterans Association named its Ocala chapter after her, its first to be named after a woman.         Ms. Gritsavage is survived by a sister, Jennie Clard.       
         Carolyn R. Payton, a psychologist who was the first black and the first woman to head the Peace Corps, died on April 11 at her home in Washington. She was 75.         The cause was a heart attack.         Dr. Payton was director of the Peace Corps from September of 1977 until November 1978. One of her major goals was to attract more blacks and Hispanics to the volunteer overseas service organization.         ''The fact of my being here should be a message to blacks,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times Magazine in 1977. ''This has been a white, middle-class adventure in the past. I'd like to tap the great reservoir of black interest in Africa, for example.''         Another goal was to bring youthful idealists back to the organization after the Nixon administration's emphasis on skilled experts.         ''I believe very strongly that the ability to provide technical assistance should be secondary to a volunteer's motivation,'' Dr. Payton said in an interview with U.S. News and World Report in 1977.         Dr. Payton began in the Peace Corps as a field assessment officer in 1964. She went on to supervise the selection of officers.         She also worked as an overseas country director, supervising 130 volunteers working on projects on eight islands in the eastern Caribbean.         Dr. Payton was forced to resign after disputes with Sam Brown, the director of Action, the umbrella agency that then oversaw the Peace Corps and domestic volunteer programs. One major point of disagreement was Mr. Brown's proposal to send volunteers for short periods to developing countries and then bring back the skills they had learned to fight poverty in the United States.         Two weeks after resigning, Dr. Payton told The Washington Post that Mr. Brown was trying to turn the corps into an ''arrogant, elitist'' political organization intended ''to meddle in the affairs of foreign governments.''         ''The Peace Corps has strayed away from its mission,'' she said. ''As director, I could not, because of the peculiar administrative structure under which the Peace Corps operates, do anything about this situation. As an ex-director, I am free to sound the alarm.''         Carolyn Robertson Payton was born on May 13, 1925, in Norfolk, Va. She graduated from Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C., and received a master's degree in psychology from the University of Wisconsin. She earned a doctorate in counseling and school administration from Columbia University Teachers College.         She was a professor of psychology at Livingstone College in Salisbury, N.C.; Virginia State University; what is now Elizabeth City State University in North Carolina; and Howard University. She returned to Howard after her initial Peace Corps assignments to direct counseling services from 1970 until 1978.         After resigning as Peace Corps director, she again returned to Howard to become dean of counseling services from 1980 to 1995. The combination of pragmatism and kindliness she brought to the post was suggested by tips she gave Essence magazine in 1992 to help parents and children deal with college rejection.         One suggestion was to recognize that the young person might not yet be mature enough to make it in college. ''Don't consider the rejection final,'' she advised.         Dr. Payton is survived by her sister, Jean Robertson Scott of Washington.       
         Maria-Gaetana Matisse, widow of the art dealer Pierre Matisse and a driving force behind the foundation that donated his vast personal archive to the Pierpont Morgan Library, died on April 7 in Manhattan. She was 58.         The cause was kidney failure, said a spokeswoman for the Pierre and Maria-Gaetana Matisse Foundation.         Mrs. Matisse, who was known as Tana, was born in Vienna in 1943. Her father, Karl von Spreti, was a founding member of the Christian Democratic party in Germany after World War II. In 1956 he was appointed ambassador to Luxembourg, and in the 1960's assumed diplomatic assignments in Cuba and Jordan, and Mrs. Matisse spent parts of her childhood in each of those countries.         In 1967, after studying languages in Germany, Mrs. Matisse moved to London and then to New York. After working for several years in the art world, she took a job at the gallery owned by Pierre Matisse, a son of the artist Henri Matisse and a leading international dealer in modern art. In 1974 she and Mr. Matisse, then in his 70's and a widower, married. They divided their time for the next 15 years between New York, Paris and the south of France.         After Mr. Matisse's death and the closing of the gallery in 1989, she and his three children by his first marriage established the Pierre Matisse Foundation. In 1998 the organization gave Mr. Matisse's archive, which included extensive correspondence with Giacometti, Miro, Dubuffet and Henri Matisse, to the Morgan Library, where a portion of it is to be exhibited in March 2002.         In 1999 Mrs. Matisse established the Pierre and Maria-Gaetana Matisse Foundation, which is preparing a catalogue raisonne of the painter Yves Tanguy.         Mrs. Matisse made frequent loans to exhibitions from the collection of modern art she inherited from her husband. She participated in the activities of several museums, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art and the Morgan Library, where she was a member of the director's round table and the visiting committee of the department of drawings and prints.         She is survived by two brothers, Arardo Graf von Spreti and Alessandro Graf von Spreti, both of Munich.       
         Emily MacFarquhar, who applied a scholar's meticulousness to many years of reporting on China and South Asia, notably in more than 20 years with The Economist, died on March 18 in her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 62.         The cause was a brain tumor, said her son, Rory MacFarquhar.         Mrs. MacFarquhar, who traveled widely in Asia and whose reports and observations had a keen audience among scholars and foreign policy experts, also worked for several years for British television and for U.S. News & World Report, covering subjects like Mao's Cultural Revolution, the Bangladesh war of independence and women's rights.         Although her articles for The Economist carried no byline, her work was recognized and praised by experts in her field. She wrote at length about Chinese dissidents, often befriending them when they visited the West, said Merle Goldman, a professor of Chinese history at Boston University.         By examining South Asia, Mrs. MacFarquhar helped focus the West on an often ignored region, said Amartya Sen, master of Trinity College at Cambridge University and a Nobel Prize-winning economist.         Jonathan Mirsky, former East Asian editor of The Times of London, credited Mrs. MacFarquhar with unusually good training before she began reporting in China, remarkable diligence and excellent contacts. ''She was a significant China journalist of her time,'' he said.         An early published work was a pamphlet in 1968, ''China: Mao's Last Leap.'' It was was one of the first detailed examinations of the Cultural Revolution. Mrs. MacFarquhar did not publish books, but worked on a book about former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto of Pakistan. The writer could not conduct interviews for the book because of deteriorating eyesight.         Emily Jane Cohen was born on June 23, 1938, in the Bronx. She worked on school newspapers at the Bronx High School of Science and Wellesley College.         After college, the writer Irving Kristol, a distant relative, helped her land a job at The China Quarterly, a new journal. For six months, she was secretary to the editor, Roderick MacFarquhar. She then earned a master's in East Asian studies from Harvard, studying with John K. Fairbank, the historian and China expert.         After a year in Taiwan studying Chinese, she returned to the United States by way of India, where she ran into her former supervisor, who was covering Nehru's funeral. They were married six months later and settled in London, where The Economist hired her in 1965. Her routine was to make long interview trips to Asia several times a year, using reports from The Economist's extensive freelance network at other times.         In her last years in London, she also worked on a program on commercial Channel 4, covering politics from Northern Ireland, Hong Kong and British regional issues.         When Mr. MacFarquhar accepted an offer to be chairman of the Harvard government department, Mrs. MacFarquhar wrote for The Economist from Cambridge until joining U.S. News in 1986 as foreign editor. She later becoming a contributing editor.         In 1994, she helped organize a report on women's difficulties in the struggle for equality, ''The War Against Women.''         Surviving are her husband and son, both of Cambridge, and her daughter, Larissa, of Brooklyn.       
         Nyree Dawn Porter, who entranced millions of television viewers around the world when she starred as the beautiful Irene, trapped in a loveless marriage in the BBC adaptation of John Galsworthy's ''Forsyte Saga'' in the late 1960's, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 61.         Her agent said she died unexpectedly but gave no further details.         Produced by Donald Wilson to coincide with the centenary of Galsworthy's birth, the 26-part ''Forsyte Saga,'' which recounted the lives and loves of an upper-middle-class merchant family in London from 1879 to 1926, was first broadcast in 1967 and went on to attract more than 100 million viewers in 26 countries. It was shown in the United States on public television starting in 1969.         For Ms. Porter, whose performance won her an award from the Society of Film and Television Arts as best actress and designation by Queen Elizabeth II in 1970 as an officer of the Order of the British Empire, ''The Forsyte Saga'' proved to be a mixed blessing.         She said that afterward, BBC regarded her as ''our Irene'' and turned aside her agent's efforts to have her cast in other major roles. And her private life was shadowed  by her success and her travels as an actress. Her husband, Bryon O'Leary, an actor who had been a childhood friend and was often thrust aside by ''Forsyte'' fans eager to meet Irene, died in 1970 of an overdose of whiskey and barbiturates.         In 1976 Ms. Porter married another actor, Robin Halstead. Before they divorced in 1987, they had a daughter, Tayla, who survives her.         After ''Forsyte,'' Ms. Porter said, ''I waited for the movie offers to pour in, but they just didn't.''         Nevertheless, she remained busy. She starred in several British television series and continued to act on the stage and in films. In 1998 she played the ballerina Margot Fonteyn in the film ''Hilary and Jackie.''         Ms. Porter was born in New Zealand on Jan. 22, 1940. She was given a Maori name, Ngaire, meaning little heart-shaped flower, but for clarity she changed it to Nyree, its phonetic pronunciation. She left New Zealand for England in 1958.         In a few more years, her work in ''The Forsyte Saga'' would win her one critic's designation as ''the first romantic sex symbol of the telly age.''       
         Dr. Dorothy Burr Thompson, a classical archaeologist who was one of the world's leading experts on ancient terra-cotta art, died on May 10 at her home in Hightstown, N.J. She was 101.         Dr. Thompson researched and wrote extensively on Hellenistic terra-cotta figurines, small statuettes that were ubiquitous in Greece in the second and third centuries B.C. The figurines were traded freely and could be found in almost any Greek household. Archaeologists use them today in describing the culture and taste of the era.         Under the guidance of Dr. Hetty Goldman, Dr. Thompson worked on excavations in Greece beginning in 1924 at the sites of Phlius and Prosymna in the Peloponnesus and in Boeotia, a province in central Greece where she cataloged pottery at the site of Eutresis.         In 1934, she joined the staff of the American School of Classical Studies and became the first woman to be appointed a fellow of the excavation in the Agora, or civic center, of ancient Athens. It was there that she met Dr. Homer A. Thompson, assistant director of the Agora excavation, whom she married that same year.         Working together in Athens, the two were responsible for uncovering famous monuments like the garden in which the Temple of Hephaistos stood and the Odeion, or music hall, of Emperor Augustus's closest friend, Agrippa.         Beginning in 1950, in a project inspired by her love of gardening, Dr. Thompson reconstructed all 20 acres of the ancient garden and replanted olive, laurel, oleander and poplar trees in the garden.         Dr. Thompson wrote more than 50 scholarly papers and books on her excavation work, including the book ''An Ancient Shopping Center: The Athenian Agora,'' published in 1971.         She also helped form the Canadian Classical Association and was a contributing editor of its journal Phoenix. She was acting director of the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology in 1946 and went on to hold visiting professorship or lectureship at Bryn Mawr, Princeton and Oberlin and at the University of Sydney.         In 1972, Dr. Thompson was awarded an honorary doctorate by the College of Wooster in Ohio for her contributions to archaeology, and in 1987 she received the gold medal for distinguished archaeological achievement from the Archaeological Institute of America.         She received her Ph.D. from Bryn Mawr in 1931, doing her doctoral dissertation on terra cottas from the site of Myrina in Asia Minor. Her bachelor's degree, also from Bryn Mawr, was in classical archaeology and Greek.         Her husband died last May at 93.  Dr. Thompson is survived by her three daughters, Hope Kerr of Cedar Grove, N.J., Hilary Kenyon of West Hartford, Conn., and Pamela Sinkler-Todd of Philadelphia; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Rita Hunter, the British soprano famed especially for her performances as Brünnhilde and Norma, died last Sunday in Sydney, Australia. She was 67.         Possessed of an immense voice, forthright and ringing, Ms. Hunter in her prime, which coincided roughly with the 1970's, seemed ready to take over from Birgit Nilsson as the world's leading Wagnerian soprano. In 1975, when the two singers appeared together at the Metropolitan Opera in ''Die Walküre,'' Ms. Hunter as Brünnhilde and Ms. Nilsson switching from that role to Sieglinde, it was as if the bequeathing -- or the challenge -- were being staged.         But the process stalled. When Ms. Hunter began to have difficulty controlling her voice, her gifts of native ability and robust good sense were insufficient.         Rita Nellie Hunter was born on Aug. 15, 1933, in Wallasey, England, where her father was a boilermaker. She had singing lessons with Olive Lloyd and Harry Burgon, and appeared in ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' when she was 14. She also studied with Edwin Francis in Liverpool.         In 1954 she joined the chorus of the Sadler's Wells Opera, in London, and continued her training with Edward Renton. Three years later she joined the Carl Rosa Opera and married a colleague, the baritone John Darnley-Thomas. She found herself back in London when the Carl Rosa and Sadler's Wells companies merged in 1959, but before resuming her career, she won a scholarship that allowed her to study for six months with the great soprano Eva Turner.         After that she went to her husband's teacher, Redvers Llewellyn, and began to get important roles at Sadler's Wells, including Senta in ''The Flying Dutchman'' in 1964, her first Wagner. In 1968 she had a baby, but was soon preparing for the English National Opera's ''Ring,'' under the conductor Reginald Goodall.         That ''Ring,'' which began with ''Die Walküre'' in 1970 and was completed in 1973, was a triumph, thanks partly to Ms. Hunter's boldly sung and magnificent Brünnhilde. She went on to sing -- apart from her Met Brünnhilde in the spring of 1975 -- the title role in ''Norma'' in San Francisco in October that year and at the Met immediately after. Her other roles included Abigaille in ''Nabucco'' (New Orleans, 1978), Turandot (Welsh National Opera, 1979) and Leonora in ''Il Trovatore'' (Welsh National Opera, 1980). She also repeated her Brünnhilde in the Seattle ''Ring'' of 1980.         She was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1980.         In 1981 she signed a three-year contract with the Australian Opera, and sang Brünnhilde, Isolde, Donna Anna in ''Don Giovanni,'' Aida, the ''Trovatore'' Leonora, Norma, and Santuzza in ''Cavalleria Rusticana.'' She elected to remain in Australia, and, though she did rather little stage work after 1985, was much in demand for concerts and recitals in Australia, Britain and the United States. Her autobiography, ''Wait Till the Sun Shines, Nellie,'' came out in 1986.         Her husband died in 1994. She is survived by her daughter, Mairwyn.       
         Dorothee Metlitzki, a retired professor of English at Yale and a prominent scholar of medieval Arabic, Middle English and Herman Melville, died on April 14 in Hamden, Conn. She was 86.         Her most definitive work focused on the intersection of Arabic and English culture during the Middle Ages, but she was also known for her scholarship on Melville, Chaucer and ''The Pearl,'' a seminal medieval poem.         Dr. Metlitzki was born in Germany and spent part of her childhood in Russia, where her family fled the Bolsheviks for two years. She grew up in Lithuania. Although English was not her native language, she gained renown teaching and writing about American and British culture.         At Yale and elsewhere, Dr. Metlitzki was known as a riveting lecturer and storyteller who would regale her audiences with firsthand accounts of some of the 20th century's most turbulent times. Her father, an international businessman, was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks but later freed by his own workers. And Dr. Metlitzki herself left Eastern Europe just as the Nazis were coming to power and lost members of her family to the Holocaust.         When she was 17, she went to the University of London, where she became a protégée of Moshe Sharett, who later became the second prime minister of Israel. After receiving a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees, she moved to Jerusalem and took part in Israel's founding.         She was a co-founder of the English Department at Hebrew University, helped found a self-help organization for Arab women and traveled around the world marshaling support for the Jewish state.         When Golda Meir was prime minister of Israel, Dr. Metlitzki served in her government: she worked as press officer for the Foreign Ministry and secretary for the affairs of Arab women in the Israeli Federation of Labor.         In 1954 Dr. Metlitzki enrolled in the new Ph.D. program in American Studies at Yale. She then taught English at the University of California at Berkeley and became the second woman to receive tenure in Berkeley's English department.         In 1966 she returned to Yale and there, too, became the second woman in the English department to receive tenure. A philologist who spoke eight languages, Dr. Metlitzki taught at Yale until she turned 70 in 1984. After retiring, she continued to lead seminars and remained an active scholar until her death.         Among her published works are ''The Matter of Araby in Medieval England'' (Yale University Press, 1977) and ''Melville's Orienda'' (Yale University Press, 1960).         Dr. Metlitzki married three times. She is survived by a daughter from her second marriage, Ruth Grdseloff, of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Marie Jahoda, one of the world's foremost social psychologists and an emeritus professor at the University of Sussex, died on April 28 at her home in Keymer, in southeast England. Dr. Jahoda, who taught at New York University in the 1950's, was 94.         In a long career as a researcher, teacher and writer, Dr. Jahoda, known as Mitzi, examined social issues in the field well beyond the realm of dry statistics, and in her classes emphasized a humanistic approach and adherence to scientific rigor in social research.         In New York from 1949 to 1958, she was a professor of social psychology at N.Y.U. and was a founding director of its Research Center for Human Relations. She was the source of a steady stream of surveys and reports on the social fabric of the city and the country.         Her topics included anti-Semitism and ethnic and religious prejudice in the work place and in intergroup relations. In one report she found that opinion researchers must sometimes resort to biased questions to detect bias on the respondent's part.         ''People with prejudices,'' she concluded, ''seldom like to admit it.''         On behalf of the federal Public Health Service, she investigated the effect of conditions in a wartime boom town on the mental health of workers. For this, she documented overcrowded living quarters and a dearth of education, health and recreation centers.         She tackled the delicate issue of loyalty in the political atmosphere of the 1950's by studying the impact of federal security measures on government employees.         In 1954 she assessed the role of women in America and wrote that women seeking to combine marriage with a career need strong mental health and an ability to solve problems.         Her investigation of conformity in America in the 1950's found the issue to be oversimplified. There were several basic types of conformers, she said. The most common type she called drifters, people who willingly changed their beliefs because they lacked adequate knowledge of the arguments pro or con. Another category she characterized as people who had definite and unpopular beliefs that they kept to themselves for fear of the consequences of speaking out.         Born in Vienna, Marie Jahoda absorbed the teachings of Freud and Jung and received her doctorate at the University of Vienna. She gained early recognition with a sociological study conducted in Marienthal, near Vienna, with Hans Zeisel and her first husband, Paul Lazarsfeld.         Marienthal, an industrial district, was racked by unemployment in the 1920's and 1930's. Working unobtrusively, the researchers measured the psychological consequences. For Dr. Jahoda the project demonstrated that work met a basic need for most people, giving them personal worth, social coherence and structured time.         As a Social Democrat opposed to the Austrian government even before Hitler annexed the country, she was imprisoned in 1936 but managed to reach England. There her research took on topics like unemployment in the coal mines and the transition from the classroom to the work place.         She came to the United States after World War II and worked as a researcher for the American Jewish Committee and at Columbia University before moving to N.Y.U.         She returned to Britain in 1958 to marry Austen Albu, a Labor member of Parliament. She worked as a researcher and teacher at the University of Sussex from 1965.         Mr. Albu died in 1994. Dr. Jahoda is survived by a daughter from her first marriage, Lotte Bailyn of Belmont, Mass., a professor of management at M.I.T.; and two grandsons. Dr. Jahoda and Dr. Lazarsfeld divorced in the 1930's. He became a professor of sociology at Columbia University and died in 1976.         Correction:  May 18, 2001, Friday  An obituary on May 10 about Dr. Marie Jahoda, a social psychologist, omitted two survivors. They are a sister, Rosi Kuerti of Cleveland, and a brother, Fritz Jahoda of Concord, Mass.       
         Sarah Tomerlin Lee, whose career in fashion, advertising, retailing and interior design spanned more than six decades, until her retirement three years ago, died on April 15 at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Mrs. Lee, an imposing woman who was rarely seen without her pearls, came to New York in 1936 and quickly rose to prominence in the fashion world. Her experience writing advertising copy for a store her father managed in Utica, N.Y., paved the way for a job in the advertising department at Bonwit Teller, then a fashionable Fifth Avenue store.         For about 30 years, she shuttled between the advertising world, where she worked with Helena Rubenstein, Elizabeth Arden and Leona Helmsley, and magazine editing, where she became a colleague of major fashion figures, including Diana Vreeland and Carmel Snow. She was an editor at Vogue Magazine and then managing editor at Harper's Bazaar.         In 1960, she became a vice president of Lord & Taylor, in charge of advertising, promotion, display and public relations, and in 1965 she was named editor of House Beautiful, where she remained until 1971.         She met her husband, Tom Lee, in 1937 when she joined Bonwit Teller, where he was then display director. They were married a year later, and shortly after Mr. Lee left to start Tom Lee Ltd., a design company.         Mrs. Lee's career changed direction after the death of her husband in an automobile accident in 1971. She initially joined his firm to complete his contracts but stayed to carry on and expand the business, which concentrated on large interior design projects for hotels.         Under her leadership, the firm worked on the interior design of 40 hotels and inns in the United States, including the Helmsley Palace in Manhattan, the Willard in Washington and the Bellevue in Philadelphia. Other hotel commissions ranged from Canada to Australia.         From 1993 to 1997, she was head of the interior design division of the architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, which restored Ellis Island and Grand Central Station.         Sarah Tomerlin was born on Aug. 18, 1910, in Union City, Tenn. She graduated from Randolph-Macon Women's College. Her survivors include two sons, Todd Granville Lee, of Boston, and Charles Tomerlin Lee, of Greenwich, Conn.; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         On behalf of the Fashion Institute of Technology, Mrs. Lee edited ''American Fashion: The Life and Times of Adrian, Mainbocher, McCardell, Norell, Trigère,'' a compilation of midcentury American clothing designers, published by The New York Times in 1975.         She was also president of the Fashion Group from 1960 to 1963 and was for a time president of the Decorators Club. She was a trustee of the New York School of Interior Design and a founder of the New York Landmarks Conservancy. In 1990 she was named a designer of distinction by the American Society of Interior Designers.       
         Lillemor Taylor Robb, chairwoman of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct from 1975 to 1989, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Albany. She was in her 80's and lived in Slingerlands, N.Y.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Robb, a political independent who had had training to become a legal secretary, was married to Gene Robb, who was the publisher of Capital Newspapers, including The Times Union of Albany. He died in 1969.         She held posts in the nonprofit world before Gov. Malcolm Wilson appointed her to the Commission on Judicial Conduct when it was founded in 1974.         The panel was established by the State Legislature and Governor Wilson to uproot corrupt and abusive judges during a national movement for accountability from the bench. From 1961 to 1981, the 49 other states also set up judicial review groups.         Govs. Hugh L. Carey and Mario M. Cuomo reappointed Mrs. Robb to the New York commission. Its other members elected her as chairwoman for seven successive two-year terms.         Lillemor Taylor Robb, known as Lee, was born in Stavanger, Norway, the daughter of the American consul general there. She grew up in Nebraska and graduated from the University of Nebraska.         She is survived by three daughters, Victoria McGoldrick of Loudonville, N.Y.; Christina Robb of Sharon, Mass.; and Deborah Twombly of Cape Elizabeth, Me.; 11 grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Yaltah Menuhin, a pianist and the younger sister of the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, died on Saturday, The Times of London reported. The Times did not report where she died. She was 79.         Ms. Menuhin, the youngest of the three Menuhin siblings, who all became prominent musicians, was born in San Francisco in October 1921. She grew up traveling the world with her family as Yehudi Menuhin, who was five and a half years her senior, established his early career.         But like her older sister, Hephzibah, she was attracted to the piano rather than the violin. Ms. Menuhin's teachers included Marcel Ciampi, in Paris; Armando Silvestri, in Rome; and Carl Friedberg, at the Juilliard School in New York. Occasionally she performed with her brother as an accompanist and chamber music partner, and she sometimes played piano duets with her sister as well.         At Yehudi Menuhin's 50th-birthday concert at the Royal Festival Hall in London in 1966, he conducted a performance of the Mozart Concerto for Three Pianos in which the soloists were Hephzibah, Yaltah and Jeremy Menuhin, his son.         Ms. Menuhin performed regularly as both a soloist and a chamber player. In 1951 she made a joint New York debut with Israel Baker, the violinist. She also performed with Michael Mann, a violist and the son of Thomas Mann. And in the 1960's she began a piano duo with her husband, Joel Ryce. Mr. Ryce died in 1998. An earlier marriage, to Benjamin Rolfe, ended in divorce.         Ms. Menuhin is survived by two sons, Robert and Lionel Rolfe.         Although she had retired from the concert stage, Ms. Menuhin gave occasional performances in recent years. Her last, on Wednesday, was at the Orwell Park School in Ipswich, England, where she played a program of Chopin and Debussy Preludes.       
         Judith Moses, a television news producer and teacher who also worked to expose the abuses confronted by journalists working on dangerous assignments abroad, died at home in Manhattan on Saturday. She was 61 and lived in Manhattan and Kent, Conn.         The cause was liver cancer, her husband, Harry Moses, said.         Mrs. Moses was on the board of the Committee to Protect Journalists, a human rights organization in Manhattan that focuses on the rights of reporters overseas. She produced public affairs documentaries and news programs for numerous networks and film companies over a 25-year career in journalism.         Her most recent work included the U.S. News & World Report/Freedom Forum series ''World@Large,'' which is broadcast on WNET, Channel 13, in New York.         Mrs. Moses, a Fulbright scholar, was an adjunct professor of journalism at the New York University Graduate School of Journalism last year and had taught in 13 African countries since 1991 as part of the United States Information Agency's Visiting Scholars Program, her husband said. She also trained human rights monitors in recording violations on videotape.         Since 1989, Mrs. Moses had been a principal in the Mosaic Group, a media company she founded with her husband in 1985. A PBS series that she produced with the Children's Express News Magazine won Peabody and Emmy Awards. From 1979 to 1989, she was an investigative producer for ''20/20,'' the ABC News magazine.         Mrs. Moses was born in Charleston, W.Va., and graduated from Smith College in 1962. After studying on a Fulbright scholarship in Germany, she worked as a translator, then began her career in news as an associate producer at ABC News, her husband said.         In addition to her husband, a producer for ''60 Minutes II,'' she is survived by their daughter, Anne Moses, and a granddaughter, both of San Francisco.       
         Yvonne Dionne, a member of the first recorded set of quintuplets to survive more than a few days, died on Saturday morning in a Montreal hospital. She was 67.         She died of cancer, said Carlo Tarini, a family spokesman.         When they were born in 1934 to an already large, poor farm family in Callander, in Ontario, Yvonne, Emilie, Marie, Cecile and Annette together weighed 13 and a half pounds on an old potato scale.         They developed from a single egg before the days of fertility treatments, and became instantly famous, seemingly a cheery miracle in the midst of the Great Depression.         But, isolated from playmates and their own parents, they did not share that cheer. Quintland, the residence-cum-sideshow where paying visitors could view them three times a day through one-way glass, outstripped Niagara Falls as a Canadian tourist attraction.         The Canadian ''Little Women'' brought an estimated $500 million to Ontario over the nearly 20 years they lived there.         They met the Queen of England, christened warships and graced the cover of Life magazine, but when Yvonne first left home at 19, Mr. Tarini recalled her saying, she could not tell the difference between a nickel and a dime.         ''Multiple births should not be confused with entertainment, nor should they be an opportunity to sell products,'' she and her two surviving quintuplets wrote in an open letter to the parents of the McCaughey septuplets that was published in Time magazine in 1997. ''Our lives have been ruined by the exploitation we suffered.''         The first inkling of their profit potential came shortly after their birth when their father, Oliva, signed a contract to display them at the Chicago World's Fair. Public outrage ensued, and the government took the ''quints'' from their parents' care. At Quintland, the doctor who delivered them, Allan Dafoe, became their primary caretaker.         But that did not protect them from becoming a sideshow. The Dionne sisters appeared in advertisements for everything from Puretest Cod Liver Oil to Lysol and Palmolive. Because the rights to their image had been sold, they said later, their parents were not allowed to photograph them and visits from Oliva and their mother, Elzier, were discouraged.         Meanwhile, Dr. Dafoe became one of the world's most celebrated doctors, writing newspaper columns on the quints' daily schedule and even about the pebbles in Callander, which were said to enhance fertility. In 1936 the quints appeared in their first of several movies, ''The Country Doctor,'' based on the life of Dr. Dafoe.         Even their exploitation, seemingly, was exploited, in books like ''The Dionne Legend: Quintuplets in Captivity.'' In 1965, the sisters published their own plaintive memoirs: ''We Were Five: the Dionne Quintuplets' Story.'' In 1998, they sued the government for the separation from their parents and won $4 million.         After a custody battle, their father regained custody of them from the state when they were nearly 10 years old. But in a second book, ''Family Secrets: the Dionne Quintuplets' Autobiography,'' published in 1994, the three surviving quintuplets said that he had sexually abused them, an accusation that their other siblings denied.         The sisters, raised Roman Catholic, were in and out of convents, both as students and initiates. At 20, Emilie died of suffocation during an epileptic seizure.         At 21, the remaining sisters each got $250,000 from a trust fund of their childhood earnings, and shortly afterward they took a determined stab at normalcy, moving into an apartment in Montreal and thus beginning a long estrangement from their parents.         Three of the sisters eventually married and had children, later divorcing. Marie, who had been hospitalized for nervous depression and had placed her two daughters in foster care, died in 1970 of a blood clot. Yvonne is survived by Annette and Cecile Dionne and five of eight other siblings.         Yvonne Dionne, considered the most artistic of the sisters, made several attempts to join a convent before settling in St. Bruno in the home of her sister, Annette. She became a librarian and lobbied the government on behalf of the Duplessis Orphans, children, many of whom were born out of wedlock, who were placed in psychiatric wards in the 1950's, Mr. Tarini said.         She also traveled to Europe and India.         Cecile Dionne once called Yvonne ''the most reserved and perhaps the most individual of us.''       
         Modjadji V, the last of a line of rain queens and the only woman who was a tribal ruler in modern-day southern Africa, died on Thursday in a clinic in Petersburg, South Africa. She was 64.         Although modern meteorology and politics have robbed the mysterious Modjadjis of the awe that once protected their tiny tribe, the Lobedu, her death created a succession crisis. Her 20-year-old granddaughter, Makhaele, who was to have succeeded her as Modjadji VI, died on Monday. Makhaele's mother died years ago.         The queen died of renal and heart failure, according to the Pietersburg Medi-Clinic. The cause of the younger woman's death has been given only as ''a short illness.''         A spokesman said the family was upset that the world had been notified before succession could be discussed or funeral arrangements made. Although Modjadji V refused to discuss ceremonial secrets, a 1937 anthropological text says the queens' decaying bodies were stored for weeks and water poured over them to create a rain-making potion. The earliest Modjadjis were never seen and were said to be immortal.         For generations, the Lobedu were left unmolested by more powerful neighbors, the Zulu and Swazi, for fear of their queens' power over the rains. In times of drought, caravans of gifts were sent up to their village, also called Modjadji, in the Drakensberg Mountains. The high valley around the village is sort of a climatic anomaly: set on dry slopes above a drier plain, it squeezes enough rain from the clouds blown off the Indian Ocean to grow bananas. The nearby Modjadji Forest is full of rare cycads, fern-like trees that date to the time of the dinosaurs.         Anthropological texts say the line of Modjadjis started in 1800, when Mugodo, a chief of the Dzugudini tribe, had a vision that he must marry his daughter and found a female dynasty. Oral tradition is grander: it says the Lobedu come from ancient Ethiopia and built the stone fortress of Great Zimbabwe.         Officially, no Modjadji marries a man; like African kings, they take several spouses, but bear children by secret consorts.         The queen, a spokesman said, is both a secular and religious leader, and is ''mother, father and child -- three persons in one.''         Although she was visited by leaders of African Christian sects, Modjadji V was not Christian. ''I am baptized by my own god,'' she said in an interview.         Four years ago, Modjadji said no one any longer asked her to make rain; young people, she complained, had lost touch with religion. That created financial problems. Her office demanded cash gifts of about $50 for interviews, and she was not shy about counting the money herself before saying a word. She owned a leopard-skin cloak that had been in the family for five generations but could be found sitting barefoot on the mud stoop of her thatched reception hut.         Although she had asked the provincial government to encourage tourism to her village, she had little patience with visitors and is still famous for having kept President Nelson Mandela waiting.         He was not the first political visitor. White presidents paid obeisance even in the days when blacks could not vote. F. W. de Klerk visited her when he was president, and his predecessor, P. W. Botha, visited her mother. Zanele Mbeki, wife of President Thabo Mbeki, is expected to attend her funeral on Sunday.         Unseasonable rains hit Johannesburg on Thursday and continued this evening.         Correction:  July 13, 2001, Friday  An obituary on June 30 about Modjadji V, a rain queen and tribal ruler in South Africa, misidentified the member of her family who died a few days before she did. It was her daughter, Mmakheala, not her granddaughter, Makobo.       
         Rosemary Verey, the tough, artistic English gardener who brought the art of clipped boxwoods, laburnum walks and ornamental vegetable gardening to America, died in Chelsea Memorial Hospital in London on May 31. She was 82.         ''She was a marvelous lecturer and she knew so much,'' said Gregory Long, the president of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. He first heard her speak about her famous garden at Barnsley House, a 17th-century rectory in the Cotswolds of England, about 20 years ago at the Horticultural Alliance of the Hamptons.         The four-acre garden was her working laboratory, where she domesticated elements from legendary gardens, like the yellow-flowering laburnum arch at the National Trust's Bodnant Garden, in North Wales, or the ornamental potager, or vegetable garden, at the Chateau de Villandry, in the Loire Valley in France, and made them seem possible for the home gardener.         Mr. Long remembers staring longingly at the slides of the neo-Classical temple that Mrs. Verey's husband, David Verey, an architectural historian, had dismantled in an English park and rebuilt himself, stone by stone.         ''It was a really good lesson in garden-building,'' Mr. Long said. ''None of this redwood pergola stuff from catalogues.''         Years later, when he became the president of the New York Botanical Garden, he would ask her to design an ornamental vegetable garden for the Bronx, complete with cold frames for extending the seasons and herbs that are used by gardeners from other cultures. She was working on the design with the sculptor Simon Verity the week that she died of pneumonia, possibly contracted while flying to Cincinnati and on to Kentucky to work on gardens there.         She was mentor to many American garden leaders like Marco Polo Stufano, who transformed Wave Hill, the public garden in the Riverdale section of the Bronx; Robert Dash, the painter who created the Madoo Conservancy, on the East End of Long Island, and Mr. Long.         Ms. Verey wrote more than a dozen garden books including ''The Classic Garden'' and ''The Garden in Winter,'' which were seminal works for Americans interested in design and sophisticated use of plants, with color and texture year-round.         In her later years, she designed gardens for British celebrities like Prince Charles and Elton John. But her favorite people were gardeners. She often gave them cuttings and seeds from plants she herself had clipped or gathered from such legendary gardens as Gethsemane, outside the city of Jerusalem, or Monet's garden at Giverny.         For more than 20 years she redesigned the grounds around Barnsley House, which is near Cirencester, in Gloucestershire, first with her laburnum arch, which dangles chains of gold flowers over purple alliums in May. Her husband laid the path beneath, a mosaic of colorful stone and pebbles collected from the Pembrokeshire beaches.         ''She had an impeccable eye for color, an ability to embroider gold against purple,'' said Mr. Dash, whose gardens at Madoo, in Sagaponack, N.Y., are widely considered an American work of art. ''She took that grim forbidding aristocratic face off English gardening, and with her charm and her writings, gave it a friendly, domesticated face.''         Mr. Dash and Ms. Verey would occasionally lecture together, playfully arguing over whose garden was more original and just who stole from whom. Did Ms. Verey really swipe her famous laburnum arch from Bodnant?         ''Of course!'' Mr. Dash said, laughing. ''But my laburnum arch bears no resemblance to hers. It's a question of following your own light.''         She studied mathematics and economics at University College in London, but left before earning her degree to marry Mr. Verey in 1939, and proceeded to raise four children, like a proper English gentlewoman of her day. She was an accomplished horsewoman, until she fell in a hunting accident.         ''A horse rolled over on her,'' Mr. Dash said. ''So her husband gave her a book on mandrakes that piqued her interest.'' And a temple just to get her started.         A scholar and perfectionist, she began to read widely, collecting rare first editions usually seen only in the British Museum or the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library. Her redesign project began in 1950, and the grounds opened to the public in 1970. By the time her husband died in 1984, she had started a new career, and a garden that would eventually attract 30,000 visitors a year.         She lectured widely in the United States, where she made five or six trips a year to cities like New York, Seattle, Atlanta or Chicago, or to Indiana and Kentucky. ''Flower shows in winter and the garden clubs in spring and summer,'' Mr. Long said. ''We began to see a lot of laburnum arches in the Hamptons.''         She took many young gardeners under her wing, drilling them in the Latin names of plants, and shooing them off for the day to plunge into the great gardens of England.         ''She would get very cross with us if we didn't speak to the head gardener,'' recalled Mr. Stufano, who with his companion, John Nally, spent many days in the gardens at Barnsley. ''Her garden was a very personal garden. She was always trying new things. It had the feeling of someone who loved plants and she was out in it constantly. She was a wonderful cook and one of my fond memories is being sent out to the garden for a few marrows, or zucchinis, for dinner.''         Long before Mr. Long became president of the New York Botanical Garden, he made a gardener's pilgrimage to Barnsley, to learn some secrets for his place upstate. He had been happily wandering about in the rain, poking about as gardeners do, when he saw her looking out the window.         ''She was so imposing in those days, I was a bit intimidated by her,'' he said. ''I almost wished that she not come out. She showed me Phlomis fruticosa, which is a silver-leafed thing with yellow flowers in the fall. I tried to grow it at home and couldn't.''         Then she locked the gate and invited him in for drinks. Years later, at his own garden upstate, she sat on his compost pile and showed him how to dry the bulbs he had carelessly thrown away. They bloomed the next year.         Her influence was not restricted to naïve Americans. David Wheeler, the editor of Hortus, a garden quarterly in England, who has built, with the artist Simon Dorell, a garden on the edge of Wales, was also nurtured by Ms. Verey, who opened up her library, garden and larder to him.         She was a great networker, or Miss Fix-It, as Mr. Wheeler put it. When he admitted that he would like to meet Prince Charles, she simply rang him up. ''Be here at 5,'' she said.'' ''We're expected at Highgrove at 6.''         Her vegetable garden, a tapestry of ever-changing cabbages, lettuces, strawberries, hop vines and espaliered fruit trees, ''has become a cliché copied around the world,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''But she made us look at growing vegetables in these times of peace and well-being. We were no longer digging for victory and growing rows of vegetables. We could do this decoratively.''         She also reinvented the formal garden, he said, with little parterres of clipped boxwood. ''Those had been part of the English garden since Elizabethan times,'' he said, ''but it had all but washed away with modernism and the 20th century.''         In 1999, Ms. Verey received a special award from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society for her work with English gardens, and the same year, was given the Royal Horticultural Society's most distinguished award, the Victoria Medal of Honor.         She leaves two sons and two daughters. Over the last two years, her son Charles has overseen the gardens, which are still open to the public. ''But the eye is gone,'' Mr. Dash said. ''The artist is gone.''       
         Louise Sulzberger, who was active in New York City social service work for many years and was a member of the New York State Commission on Aging and the community planning board for the Upper East Side, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 103.         Mrs. Sulzberger was the wife of David Hays Sulzberger, a stockbroker who was the brother of Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher of The New York Times from 1935 to 1961. Her father was Hugo Blumenthal, a banker and philanthropist who was president of the Mount Sinai School of Nursing for many years.         Louise Mayer Blumenthal, who was born in New York and educated at Miss Jacobi's, a private school, founded and directed the Yorkville Neighborhood Club, a recreation center for older people. She served as a nurse's aide at Roosevelt Hospital during World Wars I and II. She was named to Community Board No. 8 by former Mayor Edward I. Koch.         An avid golfer, Mrs. Sulzberger was women's champion of the Century Country Club in Purchase, N.Y., in 1929, 1933 and 1939, and won several Westchester County championships and New York State senior tournaments.         David Hays Sulzberger died in 1962. Mrs. Sulzberger is survived by two daughters, Jean Sulzberger and Ann S. Sand, both of New York City, and by 7 grandchildren and 15 great-grandchildren. Another daughter, Ellen S. Straus, died in 1995.

         Lyubov Sokolova, a Russian actress whose roles in more than 300 movies in the years after World War II shaped the image of the Soviet wife and mother, died on June 6 at her home in Moscow. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack, according to the German newspaper Die Welt.         Die Welt said of Miss Sokolova that in the postwar years, ''None of her Russian women colleagues formed as she did the image of the woman -- which was also propagandistically polished up, to be sure.''         She was one of only three professional performers in the 1967 Soviet movie ''Asya's Happiness,'' set on a collective farm. One of her best-known films, it was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1988. She also appeared in a 1965 Soviet movie that has been shown under the English titles ''Workers' Quarters'' and ''Workers' Settlement.'' It was shown at the Locarno Film Festival last August.         After Miss Sokolova's death, The Moscow Times called her ''Soviet cinematography's ultimate strong woman with a hard life.'' Her final movie, made last year, is titled ''The Agonies of Love.''         There was also drama in her real life. During the Nazi siege of Leningrad in World War II, when she was working in a factory and also training to become a teacher, her first husband, Georgi Arapovsky, and her mother-in-law starved to death.         After the war, when she had begun acting in films, she married a prominent director, Georgi Daneliya. He left her for another woman after more than two decades of marriage. Their son died in 1985.         Lyubov Sergeyevna Sokolova was born in the industrial city of Ivanovo, 198 miles northeast of Moscow. Her mother sold fabrics in a store. Her father was a carpenter.         As a girl, she was a theater buff and performed in school plays. In 1948, she acted in her first movie, ''The Genuine Human Being.'' As an established actress with a kindly face and large, handsome eyes, she was so helpful to fledgling performers that she acquired the nickname Mama.       
         Katharine Graham, who transformed The Washington Post from a mediocre newspaper into an American institution and, in the process, transformed herself from a shy widow into a publishing legend, died yesterday after suffering head injuries in a fall on a sidewalk on Saturday in Idaho. She was 84.         Mrs. Graham had been attending a business conference in Sun Valley. She was flown to a hospital in Boise, where she underwent brain surgery but never recovered consciousness, her son Donald E. Graham said.         Mrs. Graham was one of the most powerful figures in American journalism and, for the last decades of her life, at the pinnacle of Washington's political and social establishments, a position this insecure wife and mother never imagined she would, or could, occupy.         It was only after she succeeded her father and her husband as president and later publisher of The Washington Post, a newspaper with a modest circulation and more modest reputation, that it moved into the front rank of American newspapers, reaching new heights when its unrelenting reporting of the Watergate scandal contributed to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974.         Mrs. Graham's courage in supporting her reporters and editors through the long investigation was critical to its success. Three years before Watergate, she gave solid backing to The New York Times in a historic confrontation with the government when she permitted her editors to join in publishing the secret revelations about the war in Vietnam known as the Pentagon Papers.         Mrs. Graham would have been the first to say the single greatest decision of her professional career was not in publishing the Pentagon Papers nor in exposing the Watergate scandal but in hiring Benjamin C. Bradlee to be her editor. With her support he forged a staff of reporters and editors that made The Washington Post a force in the capital and in the world of journalism.         Mrs. Graham capped her career when she was 80 years old in 1998 by winning a Pulitzer Prize for biography for her often painful reminiscence, ''Personal History'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Nora Ephron, in her review of the best-selling memoir in The New York Times Book Review, wrote of Mrs. Graham, ''The story of her journey from daughter to wife to widow to woman parallels to a surprising degree the history of women in this century.''         Mrs. Graham was a socialite mother of four when her husband, Philip L. Graham, committed suicide in 1963. Her father had given Mr. Graham control of The Post and when the latter died, his widow found herself in a mysterious thicket of corporate politics dominated by men unaccustomed to a woman in the boardroom and highly skeptical of her ability to run a newspaper.         Mrs. Graham saw herself at best as only as an interim caretaker who would try to hold on to The Post for her children. She became something quite different -- the effective steward of a multimillion-dollar communications empire.         ''It's sort of like a fairy tale,'' Mrs. Graham said on being told of her Pulitzer Prize. But her life was its own sort of fairy tale.         She was born in New York City on June 16, 1917. Her father, Eugene Meyer, made his fortune on Wall Street, became a governor of the Federal Reserve Bank, went on to organize the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and was appointed the first president of the World Bank. Her mother, the former Agnes Ernst, was a tall, self-absorbed woman of intellectual and artistic ambition. She was scathingly critical and often harsh with her daughter, the fourth of five children.         The children were brought up in the traditions of St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, the church of presidents, where the Meyers -- Mr. Meyer was Jewish, his wife Lutheran -- had their own pew. Mrs. Graham remembered a lonely childhood in palatial houses in Mount Kisco, N.Y., and in Washington. Her father was often away working, her mother traveling and writing  letters home about her social conquests.         In the absence of maternal warmth and support, Katharine became attached to her governess. Later, she went to the Madeira School for Girls in Virginia. She spent two years at Vassar before transferring to the University of Chicago. Neither of her parents attended her graduation in 1938.         When Katharine was 16, no one thought to tell her that her father had bid $825,000 at public auction to buy the bankrupt Washington Post, a paper with a circulation of 50,000 that was losing a million dollars a year, the fifth newspaper in a five-newspaper town. Later, with yearnings of her own to get into journalism, she took a job at The San Francisco News before going to The Post to work on the editorial page and handle letters to the editor. ''If it doesn't work, we'll get rid of her,'' her father said.         'The Tail to His Kite'         Washington, in 1939, was full of young people converging on the capital to work for The New Deal. Among them was Philip L. Graham of Florida, a brilliant lawyer and a clerk at the Supreme Court, first for Justice Stanley Reed and then for Felix Frankfurter. Shy and insecure, Katharine Meyer could not believe her luck when he asked her to marry him. The heiress agreed to his terms -- that they return to Florida and his father's dairy business, provided, she remembered, that ''I could live with only two dresses because I had to understand that he would never take anything from my father or be involved with him and we would live on what he made.''         It did not work out that way, and Mr. Graham soon accepted his father-in-law's invitation to join The Post. He became associate publisher at 30 and publisher at 31. Mr. Meyer also arranged for him to hold more stock in the company than his daughter because, he explained to her, ''no man should be in the position of working for his wife.'' Mrs. Graham did not object because she knew how important it was to her father to keep The Post in the family, and, she wrote, ''in those days, of course, the only possible heir would have been a male.''         Mrs. Graham was belittled and silenced by a husband she adored, the man she called ''the fizz'' in her life. When he drank too much, gave vent to his rage or frequently became ill, she attributed it to the pressure of his work and not to a serious emotional affliction that had not yet been identified.         ''Our relationship resembled that of a chief executive officer Phil and a chief operating officer me,'' Mrs. Graham wrote in her memoir. In addition to handling all domestic matters, she paid all their living expenses from her own trust fund so her husband could pay back the debt he incurred buying even more Post stock.         Mr. Graham was immersed in building up The Washington Post, conducting negotiations to buy the rival Times-Herald and merging it with his paper, and waging political battles as The Post took on Senator Joseph McCarthy and his brand of anti-communism. Later Mr. Graham became an even more influential figure in Washington, a close friend of President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.         ''I increasingly saw my role as the tail to his kite and the more I felt overshadowed, the more it became a reality,'' Mrs. Graham wrote.         Mr. Graham had his first breakdown in 1957. His recovery was slow, but he eventually re-emerged into Washington life. In 1961, at the urging of Mr. Bradlee, then a young reporter at Newsweek, he negotiated the purchase of the weekly newsmagazine. He also added television stations to the company's holdings.         What his wife later described as his ''hyperactivity, rage and irrationality'' grew. Mrs. Graham was shattered when she discovered that her husband was having an affair with a Newsweek employee. But there was an added blow: she discovered he had a scheme to pay her off and take ownership of The Post, in which he already had controlling interest because her father had given him the majority of Class A shares.         But she decided to fight back. She resolved not to give her husband a divorce unless he gave up enough controlling stock in the Post to give her majority interest.         Mr. Graham became increasingly ill and was in and out of a mental hospital. Finally, his illness had a name, manic depression. The kinds of drugs that were later developed for his condition were not available then, and Mr. Graham, on the advice of his psychiatrist, refused such drugs that were in use. In August 1963, while on a weekend leave from the hospital, Philip Graham, then 48 years old, took one of his hunting rifles and shot himself to death at their farm in Virginia.         Holding On to The Post         As she mourned, the 46-year-old widow sought ways to hold on to The Post until her sons were old enough to run it. (Her daughter was not a candidate in her plan.) Mrs. Graham wrote that she was startled when her friend Luvie Pearson, the wife of the columnist Drew Pearson, told her to run the paper herself. ''Don't be silly, dear. You can do it,'' Mrs. Pearson told her. ''You've got all those genes. . . . You've just been pushed down so far you don't recognize what you can do.''         Mrs. Graham met with the directors of The Post a month after her husband's death and told them that the paper would not be sold and that it would remain in the family. She was elected president of the company, but she felt ''abysmally ignorant'' about how to proceed.         She said she was embarrassed to talk to her own reporters, timid in dealing with the paper's executives and uncomfortable with balance sheets. Both at The Post and in the wider journalistic community, Mrs. Graham was usually the only woman at meetings and dinners. The men hardly knew what to make of her.         Although she had absorbed a great deal over the years from both her father and her husband, she did not feel up to the job as she tried to learn from the top. With the advice and support of friends like the columnists Walter Lippmann and James Reston, she began to feel some level of comfort at The Post, but she still felt shaky at Newsweek, where she went through a series of hirings and firings that some staff members recall as creating havoc at the magazine.         Two years after taking over The Post, she hired Mr. Bradlee, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief, to be deputy managing editor and then quickly moved him up to executive editor. They made a formidable team, propelling The Post into one of its most dynamic periods. With Mrs. Graham's backing, Mr. Bradlee forged a staff of reporters and editors and put out a breezy, gutsy paper that investigated government with gusto. A saucy, impertinent Style section appeared that would soon be imitated by competitors but never matched.         Mr. Bradlee's brassy style galvanized his staff and invigorated his publisher.         'The Most Powerful Woman'         As Mrs. Graham struggled to take hold at The Post, she slowly started putting her personal life together. Truman Capote gave what could only be called a coming-out party for her, the Black and White Ball at the Plaza in New York, which was not only  the social event of the 1966 season, but also a masked ball of such glamour that it is considered one of the legendary parties of the 20th century.         She wrote, ''For one magic night I was transformed.''         Mrs. Graham's memoir quoted Gerald Clarke, one of Mr. Capote's biographers, as saying: ''She was arguably the most powerful woman in the country, but still largely unknown outside Washington. Putting her in the spotlight was also his ultimate act as Pygmalion. It would symbolize her emergence from her dead husband's shadow; she would become her own woman before the entire world.''         In 1969, and still with considerable trepidation, Mrs. Graham added the title of publisher to her position as president of the Washington Post Company.         In June 1971, The New York Times started publishing the secret history of decision-making during the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers. After a few days, a federal judge put The Times under a temporary restraining order, the first time in American history that such an order of prior restraint had been imposed.         The editors and reporters at The Post scrambled to get their own copy of the Pentagon Papers. There was a crisis atmosphere, for at the same time the Washington Post Company was in the process of being taken public, raising concerns that the company could face harsh retribution from federal regulators if it published the Pentagon Papers while The New York Times was enjoined. When The Post obtained its own copy, it was left to Mrs. Graham, as publisher, to decide whether to risk publication.         The editors and reporters urged her to publish the papers, but the lawyers suggested waiting, fearing the whole company -- its newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations -- was at stake. Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Frightened and tense, I took a big gulp and said, 'Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Let's go. Let's publish.' ''         At the Supreme Court, the Times and Post cases were heard together, and the justices voted, 6 to 3, on June 30, 1971, against restraining publication of the Pentagon Papers on the ground of endangering national security. That vote is considered a major triumph for freedom of the press.         Mr. Bradlee called the publication of the Pentagon Papers a key moment in the life of the newspaper. ''It was just sort of the graduation of The Post into the highest ranks,'' he said. ''One of our unspoken goals was to get the world to refer to The Post and New York Times in the same breath, which they previously hadn't done. After the Pentagon Papers, they did.''         In a statement yesterday, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman emeritus of The New York Times Company, said:         ''We are deeply saddened by the passing of Katharine Graham, a close friend and honored colleague. She will be remembered as a truly remarkable woman, who had a profound effect on the course of events, both at home and abroad. Throughout the last half of the 20th century, she used her intelligence, her courage and her wit to transform the landscape of American journalism, and everyone who cares about a free and impartial press will greatly miss her. We certainly will.''         Weathering Watergate         On June 17, 1972, five months before Nixon's re-election, five men were caught breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate complex. The Post began an intense investigation that eventually connected the break-in to the White House.         In the face of intimidation by the Nixon administration, The Post relentlessly published front-page articles by two little-known reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and complemented them with editorials and Herblock cartoons. It eventually proved that what the Nixon administration characterized as a ''third-rate burglary'' was, instead, a scheme directed from the White House to illegally gather intelligence on the Democratic Party, discredit opponents of the administration and subvert the democratic political process.         The Post was alone on reporting Watergate for so long that Mrs. Graham was constantly asking herself, ''If this is such a hell of a story, then where is everybody else?''         In the course of the paper's investigation, the licenses of two of the company's television stations were challenged. Mrs. Graham was advised never to be alone and was also threatened with unspecified retaliation if The Post published an article that said John Mitchell, when he was attorney general, controlled a secret fund that was used to spy on the Democrats. Mr. Mitchell memorably  warned Mr. Bernstein that ''Katie Graham'' would have a breast ''caught in a big fat wringer if that's published.'' Bob Woodward later presented Mrs. Graham with an old-fashioned wooden laundry wringer, which she kept in her office ever after.         At the beginning of the next year the Watergate burglars pleaded guilty, and one of them, hoping to get a more lenient sentence, wrote to John J. Sirica, a federal district judge, to inform him that perjury had been committed and that higher-ups were behind the break-in. That letter vindicated the time and space The Post had devoted to the scandal. For its Watergate reporting, the newspaper was awarded the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for public service.         Meanwhile, the Senate began investigating the scandal and a special prosecutor was appointed. In April 1973, Nixon accepted some responsibility. But in July, it was disclosed that a taping system in the Oval Office had recorded his every word. The tapes revealed that Nixon had ordered a cover-up. He resigned in August 1974.         Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Without the tapes, the true story would never have emerged. In fact, I believe that we at The Post were really saved in the end by the tapes and the lucky chance that they weren't destroyed.''         Meeting the Elite         In time, as Mrs. Graham became more comfortable with her ability to exercise power, she took trips to confer with foreign leaders, usually accompanied by one of the reporters and her friend Meg Greenfield, who was editor of the editorial page of The Post and a columnist for Newsweek. Mrs. Graham liked to tell the story of her visit to a village in the Ivory Coast where the chief exclaimed what an honor it was to have with them the 17th most important person in the world, a description that she said he had apparently picked up from a poll that had appeared in U.S. News & World Report.         In Washington she started to entertain the political elite at her home in Georgetown and an invitation from her came to be seen as second only to an invitation to the White House.         President Bush recalled in a statement yesterday how Mrs. Graham had welcomed him and his wife, Laura, to Washington with a dinner at her home, as she had with other presidents. He called her ''a true leader and a true lady, steely yet shy, powerful yet humble, known for her integrity and always gracious and generous to others.''         The ''A'' list of the world attended her parties. By the time of her 70th birthday, she had become so powerful a figure that Art Buchwald said in his toast at her party, ''There is one word that brings us all together here tonight. And that word is 'fear.' ''         With the help of the women's movement, and particularly through discussions with Gloria Steinem, Mrs. Graham said she became more cognizant of the causes of her own insecurities and more aware of the problems of working women. She played a signal role in changing Washington mores when it became widely known that on one evening after dinner, she had refused to join the ladies upstairs while the men discussed world affairs over brandy and cigars. And  more women were added to the staffs of both The Post and Newsweek, partly because Mrs. Graham came to understand it was necessary, partly as a result of lawsuits, and partly because of a new climate throughout the country.         Over the years, she found a little time for a personal life. She was courted by a number of men, among them Adlai E. Stevenson after his failed runs for the presidency. She enjoyed weekends at her homes in Virginia and Martha's Vineyard, often in the company of her grandchildren.         Besides her son Donald, she is survived by her daughter, Elizabeth Weymouth, known as Lally; her sons William and Stephen; a sister, Ruth Epstein of Bronxville, N.Y.; 10 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         The funeral is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday at the National Cathedral in Washington.         The Business of News         Mrs. Graham's resolve on editorial questions often contrasted with indecisiveness on business matters. In the 1970's, she acknowledged in her book, she hired and dismissed top executives at Newsweek, the newspaper division and the Washington Post Company too frequently.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Graham and her associates tried to make the Washington Post Company more profitable. Newsweek took the lead among news magazines in increasing subscription and newsstand prices. But holding down costs at The Washington Post led to a bitter confrontation with the mechanical unions.         The clash came in October 1975, when the newspaper's pressmen went on strike after contract talks broke down. As the pressmen, members of Local 6 of the Newspaper and Graphic Communications Union, began their walkout, all 72 of the newspaper's presses were vandalized.         Although the paper failed to publish on the first day, a truncated issue appeared the next day. In the face of threats from the striking workers and occasional physical attacks, the reporters voted to stay on the job. Executives handled the classified advertising department, the mailroom and even the presses when they were repaired. Helicopters landed on the roof of The Post building to ferry copy to presses in Maryland and Virginia. It took nearly a month to repair the presses, but The Post continued to appear.         Mrs. Graham not only went on to win the battle of automation of her newspaper, but also to have the final word on a competitor, the financially troubled Washington Star.  The Post had 75 percent of the city's advertising linage by 1981, and The Star was forced to close. By the end of 1981, The Post's daily circulation had soared to 984,000 from 771,000.         Donald Graham succeeded his mother as publisher in 1979 and chief executive of the company in 1991, a company which by then was valued at nearly $2 billion. Mrs. Graham stepped down as chairwoman of the board in 1993, again to be succeeded by her son, but remained on the board as chairwoman of the executive committee.         Mrs. Graham served on the board of The Associated Press, and was chairwoman and president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, director of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc. and a trustee of George Washington University, the University of Chicago and the Urban Institute.         Finally, she seemed comfortable with herself. ''Worry, if not gone altogether, no longer haunts you in the middle of the night,'' she wrote. ''And you are free -- or freer -- to turn down the things that bore you and spend time on matters and with people you enjoy.''         And she did, till the end. Just two weeks ago she was surrounded by friends at the annual party her daughter gave for her in Southampton, N.Y., and last week was in Idaho for a conference of media executives where she saw more friends and colleagues. She was on her way to a bridge game when she fell.         Katharine Graham's life ended the way she said she wanted it to: ''The only thing I think any of us want,'' she once said, ''is to last as long as we're any good. And then not.''       
         Grace Borgenicht Brandt, a longtime New York art dealer, died Thursday in Manhattan. She was 86  and had homes in Manhattan and Watermill, N.Y.         Ms. Borgenicht was a tall woman whose carriage and general equanimity were almost queenly. She saw herself as both a friend and protector of artists, and with her third husband, the painter Will Brandt, whom she married in 1960, she oversaw a busy social scene in both her Manhattan and Long Island homes.         She began her gallery in the early 1950's as one of a handful of New York art dealers to represent living American artists when most American collectors were buying European art. Although she would eventually show several European artists, she remained most strongly identified with a stylistically varied group of American artists, most of whom she represented for several decades, most prominently Milton Avery, but also Ilya Bolotowsky, Jimmy Ernst, Wolf Kahn, Gabor Peterdi, Leonard Baskin, Edward Corbett and Ralston Crawford.         Ms. Borgenicht was born Grace Lubell in New York City on Jan. 25 1915, and attended the Calhoun School. She became interested in art at an early age and enrolled in the New College at Columbia University, where the experimental program enabled her to study in Paris, in the studio of the painter André L'Hote, in 1934. Returning to New York, she studied printmaking at Stanley William Hayter's Atelier 17 and earned a master's degree in art education from Columbia. In 1938 she married Jack Borgenicht, a dress manufacturer. The marriage ended in divorce, as did a subsequent one to Norman Sachs Jr.         She entered the New York art world as a painter, with her first solo show at the Laurel Gallery on East 57th Street in 1947. She soon became a key backer of its owner, Chris Ritter, helping to publish a series of print portfolios, starting with one of five etchings by Avery. In 1950 Ritter decided to close Laurel, and the artists Ernst and Peterdi, whom he also represented, urged Ms. Borgenicht to open a gallery on her own. The Grace Borgenicht Gallery opened on 57th Street in May 1951, with a show of Ernst's work.         Ms. Borgenicht held her first Avery exhibition the following October, represented the artist until his death in 1965 and then represented his estate until 1995, when she closed her gallery. She devoted more than 30 exhibitions to his work. During the early 1950's she also represented Gertrude Greene, José de Rivera, Adja Yunkers, James Brooks and Roy Gussow. In 1956, she moved to 1018 Madison Avenue and in 1981 to 724 Fifth Avenue. She continued to paint into the 1950's, was included in the 1954 Whitney Annual and had a solo show at the Martha Jackson Gallery in 1955.         In late 1954, she began an association with Margarete Schultz, the widow of the publisher and dealer Karl Heinz Schultz. Ms. Schultz organized an impressive series of exhibitions of works by the German Expressionists as well as Max Ernst, Wols and Jean Arp. Through her, the gallery represented the estate of Max Beckmann during the 1980's and early 1990's, organizing seven shows in 12 years.         During the 1980's and 90's, the Borgenicht Gallery gave first solo shows to young artists like Mark Tansey, Michael Zwack, Mark Innerst and Jane Rosen; began to represent Janet Fish; and held several shows of the work of Stuart Davis and Charles Biederman, American artists from earlier generations.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Borgenicht is survived by her sister, Shirley Black Cash of Scottsdale, Ariz., and Westport, Conn.; three daughters from her first marriage, Jan Schwartz of Los Gatos, Calif., Berta B. Kerr of Wilmington, Del., and Lois Borgenicht of Baltimore; a stepdaughter, Isabella Brandt Johansen of New York City; seven grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Beate Uhse, who as a destitute war widow sold birth control pamphlets from a bicycle before going on to develop Europe's biggest emporium of erotic goods, died on Monday in a hospital in Switzerland. She was 81.         Her company, Beate Uhse A.G., based in the northern German city of Flensburg, said the cause was pneumonia.         She personified the revolution in sexual attitudes that spread across Europe during her lifetime. And her business career began in a time when selling contraceptives to the unmarried was illegal in Germany, as were sexually explicit materials.         Undeterred by scrapes with the law, she flourished when social and legal barriers fell. As staid German attitudes mellowed, her frank, humorous nature and business acumen gained her a degree of respect.         At her death she headed the supervisory board of Beate Uhse A.G., which had reported $100 million in annual revenues at the approach of 2000. The company is listed on the Frankfurt stock exchange, employs 1,000 people and runs strings of boutiques and cinemas, a mail-order house and a film studio.         Her shops, which extend from Poland to Portugal, sell everything from contraceptives to sex toys, from movies to lingerie, though she drew the line at sadomasochism.         In 1996, Beate Uhse (pronounced bay-AH-teh OO-zeh) opened a three-story sex museum not far from the Kurfürstendamm in Berlin. The museum contains more than 3,000 objects, ranging from kitsch to 17th-century Asian art.         Most recently, her business, ranked 79th among publicly traded German companies, was said to be taking a fresh look at the American market. And to counter the business's invasion of gasoline stations, German church leaders were envisioning setting up chapels along highways.         Beate Köstlin was born in October 1919 in what then was German East Prussia. As a girl, she idolized Charles Lindbergh and as a teenager learned to fly. Among the first women allowed to fly fighter planes for the Luftwaffe, she ferried aircraft to the front lines during World War II. She married another pilot, Hans-Jürgen Uhse, who was killed in the war, as were her parents.         At war's end in 1945, with the Soviet Army approaching Berlin, she flew north with her 2-year-old son and wound up with thousands of other refugees in a small town near the Danish border. She tried to support herself and her child by selling toys, but soon realized that the women around her needed advice about birth control.         The subject had been taboo in Hitler's Germany and condoms were difficult to find. So she bicycled from village to village with mimeographed sheets telling what she had learned from books and from her mother, who was a doctor, about the rhythm method.         She soon added contraceptives and used mail drops to advertise her inventory, which filled eight pages by 1949. The campaign covered West Germany and included brochures with advice on sex.         She bought a publishing house, built a printing plant and in 1962 opened her first shop in Flensburg. Others followed in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin, but it was in 1975 that the liberalization of West German laws admitted her to the big leagues of commerce.         Long shunned by conservatives and feminists alike, she claimed vindication in 1999 when the symbol of Beate Uhse A. G. -- USE -- crossed the board of the Frankfurt stock exchange.         ''What I am happiest about,'' she told the German news agency DPA that year, ''is that we have in the last 50 years succeeded not only greatly in business, but also in being accepted in society.''       
         Aveline Kushi, who taught and promoted macrobiotic cooking and helped found one of the nation's first natural food stores, died of cancer on July 3 in Brookline, Mass. She was 78 and lived in Brookline and Becket, Mass.         A macrobiotic diet emphasizes whole grains and fresh vegetables and generally avoids meat, dairy products and processed foods. The theory of macrobiotics is that such a diet provides physical balance that  leads to greater psychological and spiritual balance.         Ms. Kushi and her husband, Michio, also taught that entire societies could become disharmonious and aggressive from eating meat and processed foods, undermining world peace. But many doctors and nutritionists warn that a strict macrobiotic diet can be nutritionally deficient.         Christine Akbar, a spokeswoman for the Kushi family, told The Associated Press that Ms. Kushi had traditional radiation therapy after learning she had cervical cancer nine years ago. When the cancer spread to her bones, she was told that no conventional treatments were available. Ms. Akbar said Ms. Kushi then relied on acupuncture and Asian medicines. The cancer went into remission for several years, Ms. Akbar said.         Ms. Kushi was born Tomoko Yokoyama on Feb. 27, 1923, in the small mountain town of Yokota in the Izumo area of Japan. She taught in elementary school during World War II, but resigned to work for peace as a member of the World Government Association, run by George Ohsawa, who is considered the father of the macrobiotic movement. Mr. Ohsawa changed her name to Aveline.         She came to the United States in 1951 to attend a meeting of students who supported world government. She stayed to study at the University of Illinois and Columbia University. She married Mr. Kushi in 1954.         Mr. Kushi had also been a student of Mr. Ohsawa and shared Ms. Kushi's enthusiasm for macrobiotics. In her autobiography, ''Aveline: the Life and Dream of the Woman Behind Macrobiotics Today'' (Japan Publications, 1988), Ms. Kushi wrote that she and her husband discovered ''there was almost no good food'' in the United States.         ''We would have to make wonderful food available to everybody ourselves,'' she wrote.         In the early 1960's, the Kushis moved from New York to Boston, where they formed discussion groups on health and world peace. Encouraged by the interest there, Ms. Kushi opened Erewhon, a food store in Brookline named for a utopian novel by the British writer Samuel Butler. It was one of the first stores billed as a natural food store.         Ms. Kushi taught cooking and wrote cookbooks, helping to popularize Japanese ingredients like miso, soy sauce and tofu among Americans. Her cookbooks included ''Aveline Kushi's Complete Guide to Macrobiotic Cooking for Health, Harmony and Peace'' (Warner Books, 1985) and ''The Changing Seasons Cookbook'' (Avery Publications, 1987).         Her views were firm. At a class in Amherst, Mass., she was asked if a touch of garlic was permissible, The New York Times reported in 1980. ''Garlic is strong,'' she said. ''It makes one angry. Garlic causes fights.''         The couple founded organizations to promote macrobiotics, including the Kushi Foundation, the Kushi Institute and One Peaceful World.         Ms. Kushi is survived by her husband; four sons, Phiya, of Becket, Larry, of New York City, Norio, of Asheville, N.C., and Hisao, of Santa Monica, Calif.; four sisters, Miyako Okada of Tokyo; Atsumi Mimura of Hiroshima, Junko Asano of Japan, and Yoko Kendall of Worthington, Mass.; three brothers, Makota Yokoyama of Japan, Kyuu Yokoyama of Spring Valley, N.Y., and Masaru Yokoyama of Dallas; and 13 grandchildren.       
         Eudora Welty, whose evocative short stories, notable for their imagery, sharp dialogue and fierce wit, made her a revered figure in contemporary American letters, died yesterday at a hospital near her home in Jackson, Miss. She was 92.         She was plagued by health problems and had been confined for some time to her home, where she had lived since high school and where she wrote most of her stories, novels, essays, memoirs and book reviews.         As a short-story master, Miss Welty is often mentioned by critics in the same breath as Chekhov, but she was  dismissed early in her career as a regionalist and did not earn widespread critical respect until she was no longer young. When recognition came, she accepted it with the ease, modesty and grace that had become her hallmarks.         She was awarded a Pulitzer Prize in 1973 for her novel ''The Optimist's Daughter.'' She also received the National Book Critics Circle Award, the American Book Award, several O. Henry Awards and the Gold Medal of the National Institute of Arts and Letters. She was inducted into the French Legion of Honor and received the Medal of Freedom in 1980, presented, she said happily, by ''one of my great Southern heroes, President Jimmy Carter.''         Late in 1998 Miss Welty said she was ''excited and delighted'' to learn that she had become the first living writer to be included in the prestigious Library of America series of collected works by United States literary giants. The library's break with its long tradition of choosing only dead authors for its series of definitive collections ushered Miss Welty into a pantheon that includes Mark Twain, Walt Whitman, Henry James, Edith Wharton, Willa Cather, Edgar Allan Poe and William Faulkner.         For decades she was pigeonholed by critics who placed her with Faulkner, Katherine Anne Porter, Flannery O'Connor and Carson McCullers as a writer of the so-called Southern School. Her reputation as a regional and apolitical writer was often cited as a reason for her failure to win a Nobel Prize. But her work, like that of those other Southern writers, transcended region and possessed a universal relevance and appeal.         ''It is not the South we find in her stories, it is Eudora Welty's South, a region that feeds her imagination and a place we come to trust,'' Maureen Howard said when she reviewed Miss Welty's ''Collected Stories'' in 1980. ''She is a Southerner as Chekhov was a Russian, because place provides them with a reality -- a reality as difficult, mysterious and impermanent as life.''         A Clan of Readers         Eudora Welty was born on April 13, 1909, in Jackson, the daughter of Christian Webb Welty, an Ohio native, and the former Chestina Andrews, who had been a West Virginia schoolteacher. The Weltys settled in Jackson shortly after their marriage, and Mr. Welty became an executive of the Lamar Life Insurance company. They also had two sons younger than Miss Welty.         The Weltys were devoted to books and learning. In ''One Writer's Beginnings,'' Miss Welty's 1984 memoir based on a series of lectures she gave at Harvard, she recalled the exhilaration she felt when she fell under the spell of books.         ''It had been startling and disappointing to me to find out that storybooks had been written by people, that books were not natural wonders, coming up of themselves like grass,'' she wrote. ''Yet regardless of where they came from, I cannot remember a time when I was not in love with them -- with the books themselves, cover and binding and the paper they were printed on, with their smell and their weight and with their possession in my arms, captured and carried off to myself. Still illiterate, I was ready for them, committed to all the reading I could give them.''         Miss Welty was a daily visitor to the local Andrew Carnegie Library, where she was allowed what she later called ''a sweet devouring'' -- a ration of two books a day by the stern-faced librarian. Several decades later, in 1986, the building was replaced; the new one was named the Eudora Welty Library.         Miss Welty learned to read before starting public school and began turning out stories as a child.         ''It took Latin to thrust me into a bona fide alliance with words in their true meaning,'' she wrote. ''Learning Latin (once I was free of Caesar) fed my love for words upon words, words in continuation and modification, and the beautiful, sober accretion of a sentence. I could see the achieved sentence finally standing there, as real, intact and built to stay as the Mississippi State Capitol at the top of my street, where I could walk through it on my way to school and hear underfoot the echo of its marble floor and over me the bell of its rotunda.''         'Listening for Stories'         Miss Welty said she discovered stories in daily life. ''Long before I wrote stories, I listened for stories,'' she wrote in 1984. ''Listening for them is something more acute than listening to them. I suppose it's an early form of participation in what goes on. Listening children know stories are there. When their elders sit and begin, children are just waiting and hoping for one to come out, like a mouse from its hole.''         Miss Welty attended the Mississippi State College for Women, where she helped to start a literary magazine, and then the University of Wisconsin, where she earned a bachelor's degree in 1929. After college Miss Welty told her parents that she wanted to be a writer, but she said that her father insisted that she ''learn something to fall back on'' to support herself, so she took advertising courses at the Columbia University School of Business.         Back in Jackson in the early 1930's, Miss Welty wrote for a radio station and contributed society items to The Commercial Appeal in Memphis. During the Depression she got a publicity job at the Works Progress Administration, which enabled her to travel throughout Mississippi. She was troubled and fascinated by the people she saw and took hundreds of snapshots with a cheap camera, developing her prints in her kitchen at night. In 1971 Random House published a collection of these pictures, ''One Time, One Place: Mississippi in the Depression.'' The book's stark, often grim black-and-white photographs revealed that Miss Welty's long-admired sense of observation was not limited to the ear.         ''I learned quickly enough when to click the shutter,'' she said later, ''but what I was becoming aware of more slowly was a story-writer's truth. The thing to wait on, to reach there in time for, is the moment when you see it. In my own case, a fuller awareness of what I needed to find out about people and their lives had to be sought for through another way, through writing stories. I knew this, anyway: that my wish, indeed my continuing passion, would be not to point the finger in judgment but to part a curtain, that invisible shadow that falls between people, the veil of indifference to each other's presence, each other's wonder, each other's human plight.''         The Depression pictures were exhibited in New York in 1936, the same year that Miss Welty, who had sent dozens of unsolicited stories to magazines, finally made her first sale. A small literary magazine called Manuscript accepted ''Death of a Traveling Salesman,'' the often anthologized recounting of the last day in the life of a lonely, ill and frightened shoe salesman who loses his way in rural Mississippi. Before he dies of a heart attack, he realizes fleetingly how little he has understood about himself and others.         It was the first of several stories published in small magazines. ''None of these publications paid, not really,'' Miss Welty recalled years later. ''Oh, I think The Southern Review was giving $25 a story, but it took two years before an agent could place one of my stories in a national magazine.''         Life at the P.O.         Miss Welty began to attract attention after The Atlantic Monthly published two of her stories destined to become classics: ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' and ''A Worn Path.'' The first, one of the most popular of the dozens that were to be printed in the years to come, is a first-person explanation by a small-town postmistress of why she is moving out of her eccentric family's home to live at the post office. The second won Miss Welty her first of six O. Henry Awards.         Early admirers of her short stories pressed Miss Welty to try her hand at a novel, but she resisted for several years. Her first hardcover book was a 1941 short-story collection, ''A Curtain of Green,'' with an introduction by Katherine Anne Porter, who had encouraged her early on. ''A Curtain of Green '' sold only 7,000 copies in 30 years, but the 17 stories in the collection became widely known and valued through their inclusion in many anthologies and college textbooks.         The editor and critic James Olney said of ''A Curtain of Green'': ''The volume's tonal variety is astonishing: from the somber 'Death of a Traveling Salesman' to the hallucinatory 'Flowers for Marjorie,' from the wonderment at the variety of human faces of 'Clytie' to the foreboding near-violence of the title piece, from the jazzy 'Powerhouse' to the satiric 'Petrified Man,' from the wildly comic 'Why I Live at the P.O.' to the dignified 'A Worn Path' (the 'grave, persistent, meditative' sound of old Phoenix Jackson's cane tapping the frozen earth establishes the tone at the outset).''         ''Why I Live at the P.O.'' combined Miss Welty's antic sense of humor with her pleasure in language. As the narrator prepares to leave her family's home, she says: ''So I hope to tell you I marched in and got the radio. And they could of all bit a nail in two, especially Stella-Rondo, that it used to belong to, and she well knew she couldn't get it back, I'd sue for it like a shot . . . The thermometer and the Hawaiian ukulele were certainly mine, and I stood on the stepladder and got all my watermelon-rind preserves and every fruit and vegetable I put up, every jar.''         An Internet Legacy         Many years later Eudora, the widely used e-mail program, was named after Miss Welty because its designer, Steven Dorner, said he had been processing so much e-mail that he felt like the Welty character who lived at the post office.         In 1941 Miss Welty followed ''A Curtain of Green'' with ''The Wide Net and Other Stories,'' and in 1942 she published ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' a novella that later became a successful musical in an adaptation by Alfred Uhry and Robert Waldman. Her first full-length novel, ''Delta Wedding,'' appeared in 1946.         Three years later, a group of stories set in Morgana, an imaginary small town on the Mississippi Delta, was published under the title ''The Golden Apples.'' All of Miss Welty's gifts for compression, metaphorical language and poetic structure were on display. So was her genius for using the details of daily life to illuminate the mysteries of the heart. In the story ''The Whole World Knows,'' she charted a doomed meeting between a young couple who were estranged:         ''There in the flower beds walked the same robins. The sprinkler dripped now. Once again we went into the house by the back door. Our hands touched. We had stepped on Tellie's patch of mint. The yellow cat was waiting to go in with us, the door handle was as hot as the hand, and on the step, getting under the feet of two people who went in together, the Mason jars with the busy cuttings in water -- ''Watch out for Mama's!'' -- a thousand times we had gone in like that. As a thousand bees had droned and burrowed in the pears that lay on the ground.''         During World War II, Miss Welty was briefly on the staff of The New York Times Book Review and sometimes contributed reviews under the pseudonym Michael Ravenna. But she returned to Jackson during the 1950's, when her mother and brothers fell seriously ill. For almost 15 years, from the mid-50's to the late 60's, she published just a few short stories, some book reviews and a children's book, ''The Shoe Bird'' (1964). During this period she cared for her family and worked on two novels. Some writers speculated that she also suffered some spiritual ordeal or artistic crisis. After the deaths of her mother and brothers, she returned in the 70's with the novels ''Losing Battles'' and ''The Optimist's Daughter.''         Miss Welty's stories often reflected the fruits of her wide reading and special interests. ''The Robber Bridegroom,'' for example, incorporates elements of folklore, fairy tales, classical myths and legends of the Mississippi River and the Natchez Trace, the road of pioneer days that stretched from Natchez, Miss., to Nashville.         In ''Delta Wedding,'' Miss Welty concentrates on the frenzied activities of the extended Fairchild family in the week before the marriage of a daughter to the plantation's overseer, who is considered by several of the Fairchilds to be an intruder unworthy of admission into the family.         Fiction of Family Life         That book, as well as the short novel ''The Ponder Heart'' (1954) and her longest one, ''Losing Battles'' (1970), are examples of Miss Welty's preoccupation with family life. They focus on weddings, reunions and funerals, which all bring family members together to recall the past, criticize and lavish praise on one another and settle old scores.         Her novels and stories expose the foibles to which large clans are prone, their tendencies to resist change, squelch individuality and ostracize outsiders. Miss Welty often shifts points of view to accomplish this, but in ''The Ponder Heart,'' she  demonstrates her extraordinary ear for dialect and a sense of the ridiculous as she tells the entire story as a comic monologue by Edna Earle Ponder, a garrulous hotel manager. This novel was adapted for the stage by Joseph Fields and Jerome Chodorov and became a hit when it opened on Broadway in 1956.         Commenting on many critics' observations that ''Losing Battles'' and her other works carried a strong sense of place, Miss Welty said: ''I think Southerners have such an intimate sense of place. We grew up in the fact that we live here with people about whom we know almost everything that can be known as a citizen of the same neighborhood or town. We learn significant things that way. We know what the place has made of these people, what they've made of the place through generations. We have a sense of continuity and that, I think, comes from place.''         And because she was in her particular place in the racially discordant 60's, she said, ''I was one of the writers who received dead-of-night telephone calls, when I was harangued by strangers saying, 'Why are you sitting down there writing your stories instead of out condemning your society?' ''         ''I didn't need their pointers to know that there was injustice among human beings or that there was trouble,'' she continued. ''I had been writing about that steadily right along, by letting my characters show this. I see as my privilege writing about human beings as human beings with all the things that make them up, including bigotry, misunderstanding, injustice and also love and affection and whatever else. Whatever else makes them up interests me.''         Miss Welty made one notable exception to her rule against direct crusading when Medgar Evers, the black civil rights leader, was shot to death by a sniper in Jackson in 1963.         ''I did write a story the night it happened,'' she said. ''I was so upset about this, and I thought: I live down here where this happened and I believe I must know what a person like that felt like -- the murderer. There had been so many stories about such a character in the stock manner, written by people who didn't know the South, so I wrote about the murderer intimately -- in the first person, which was a very daring thing for me to do.''         In the Mind of an Assassin         The story, ''Where Is the Voice Coming From?,'' was rushed into print in The New Yorker only days after Evers's killer was arrested. Taking up only two pages, it was a chilling journey into the mind of a bigoted psychopath. Hailed as a disturbingly effective examination of the roots of racial hatred, it has since been included in many anthologies.         Miss Welty never married. (Marriage, she said, ''never came up.'') She leaves no immediate survivors.         Although she was a shy person, she had many friends who were writers, among them Porter, Robert Penn Warren, Elizabeth Bowen, V. S. Pritchett, Cleanth Brooks, Shelby Foote, Walker Percy, Elizabeth Spencer, Ross MacDonald and Reynolds Price. She also had an enduring friendship with Diarmuid Russell, the agent who fiercely and devotedly represented her.         Her friends often spoke of her innate courtesy, which led her to seldom turn down requests for interviews. Those conversations usually took place at her home, and she often offered her interviewer bourbon and a home-cooked meal. She was warm and humorously self-deprecating.         One unlikely caller was Henry Miller. Miss Welty's mother, who had heard that Miller was a writer of obscene books, banned him from  their house. When Miss Welty did see him, she reported that he was ''the dullest man I ever saw in my life.''         ''He wasn't interested in anything outside himself,'' she said, ''that was the truth.''         In 1943, Faulkner wrote an unsolicited letter to Miss Welty after he had by chance read ''The Robber Bridegroom.''         ''You're doing all right,'' he said. That letter was hung near her wooden desk in an upstairs room in the Tudor-style house that her father built on Pinehurst Street in 1925, when she was 16.         ''The writing of a novel is taking life as it already exists,'' Miss Welty said. ''What distinguishes it above all from the raw material, and what distinguishes it from journalism, is that inherent is the possibility of a shared act of the imagination between its writer and its reader. There is absolutely everything in great fiction but a clear answer.''         Correction:  July 25, 2001, Wednesday  An obituary of the author Eudora Welty yesterday misstated the number of O. Henry Awards she received for short stories and misidentified the first of her stories to win one. The total was eight, not six. The first was for ''Petrified Man'' (1939); ''A Worn Path'' won in 1941.       
         Frances R. Horwich, the amiable educator who engaged millions of preschoolers as the host of the pioneering children's program ''Ding Dong School'' in the 1950's, died yesterday. She was 93.         Ringing an old-fashioned school bell to start the show, she would look into the camera, warmly wish a good morning and ask, ''How are you today?'' She paused so that toddlers at home, watching a somewhat matronly figure in swept-back hair and wearing a wool jacket, could answer. And they often did, thanks to her kindly, conversational style.         Then, ''Miss Frances'' would tell stories or demonstrate activities, like making pipe-cleaner figures or clay models. She used inexpensive, familiar toys and interspersed her presentation with unobtrusive lessons:         ''Ask your mother where to play with it,'' for a homemade musical instrument.         ''Be sure your sleeves are rolled up,'' for a messier project.         The half-hour show ended with a five-minute summation of the material.         ''Ding Dong School'' began on a Chicago station, WNBQ, in 1952. It was so popular that after six weeks, NBC picked up the program, and soon it was seen in at least 36 cities, with viewership reaching three million. The program was broadcast live at 10 a.m. on weekdays for four years, going to WNET in New York in 1959.         ''Ding Dong School,'' directed and produced by Reinald Werrenrath Jr., was one of a series of high-quality, innovative broadcasts by WNBQ that became its own of golden age of television, said Jeff Kisseloff, a television historian.         Unlike many of the children's show hosts of the period, Ms. Horwich ''actually taught kids things,'' Mr. Kisseloff said. And rather than the ''high-tech, dazzly stuff'' of today, ''it was her sitting in front of a piano or a drawing table,'' he said.         ''The intent was to educate the kids plainly and straightforwardly,'' he said. ''The fact was that it worked. You didn't need all the bells and whistles to keep kids watching.''         Its daily competitors at the time were ''Captain Kangaroo'' on CBS and ''Mickey Mouse Theater'' on ABC. A few years later, the successors to ''Ding Dong School'' appeared: ''Sesame Street'' and ''Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood.''         In her era, a far simpler time when there was no Cartoon Network or hip, irony-tinged children's programs, Ms. Horwich won acclaim. She received a George Foster Peabody award in 1953.         ''She imbues in the youngsters a sense of friendliness, confidence and faith that is truly magical television,'' The New York Times television critic, Jack Gould, wrote that year. ''She is a teacher, yes, but she is also a very genuine friend of the tots who sit entranced before the receivers.''         When she began promoting the products of sponsors, however, Mr. Gould called the step ''heartbreaking.''         ''The program is too important in too many homes to be allowed to go astray through regrettable short-sightedness,'' he wrote.         In interviews, Ms. Horwich seemed better at saying what children's programming should not be.         ''I don't think a television program should make a child's life complicated,'' she said in a 1955 interview. ''It should not get him into trouble with his parents. Sometimes very innocently a television program teaches a child a trick that is not socially acceptable and, therefore, gets him into trouble. It is not socially acceptable to throw a pie at someone or to fill someone's hat with water,'' she added, perhaps a not-so-subtle jab at Bozo the Clown.         She also deplored the violence of Westerns and crime programs, though added that normal children could handle it.         What television should do is appeal to their interests, open ''new doors and windows'' of enlightenment and help children learn to be resourceful, Ms. Horwich said.         Frances Rappaport was born in Ottawa, Ohio, on July 16, 1908, and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago in 1929. She earned her doctorate in education from Northwestern University in 1942.         In 1931, she married Harvey L. Horwich, who was later a technical consultant to the United States Air Force. Mr. Horwich died in the early 1970's. The couple had no children.         For more than two decades before first ringing the ''Ding Dong'' bell, Ms. Horwich worked in education. She taught first grade, supervised nursery schools in Chicago, was a principal, and held professorships in education at the University of North Carolina and Roosevelt College in Chicago.         But her biggest class was filled with the millions of children in America's living rooms born just a few years after World War II.         ''Our little school gives them a sense of belonging,'' she said.       
         Carole Honig Klein, a biographer and author of other nonfiction works, died on Monday from injuries after being struck by a car on the Upper East Side. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Klein's most recent work was ''Doris Lessing: A Biography'' (Carroll & Graf, 2000). That was preceded a year earlier by ''Doris Lessing: In This World but Not of It'' (Little, Brown).         Much of her writing reflected her special interest in psychology, especially children, childhood experiences and relationships between parents and children. Besides her books, she wrote numerous magazine articles and book reviews.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Klein graduated from Goddard College with a bachelor's degree in English and women's studies, followed by a master's degree in sociology and psychology. Over the years she taught English, creative writing and women's studies at Goddard, the State University of New York and New York University. She also was on the writing faculty of New School University in New York City and lectured widely on writing, women writers, women's issues and cultural history.         Early in her career Ms. Klein tried her hand at writing comedy. In the 1950's she wrote for Steve Allen's ''Tonight'' show on NBC.         Her book ''Aline'' was a biography of Aline Bernstein, a scenic and costume designer of the 1920's and 1930's (Harper, 1972). She was also the author of ''The Single Parent Experience'' (Walker, 1973), ''The Myth of the Happy Child'' (Harper, 1975), ''How it Feels to Be a Child'' (Harper, 1975) and ''Gramercy Park: An American Bloomsbury'' (Houghton, 1987).         Ms. Klein is survived by a son, William S. of Washington; a daughter, Emily McGrath of Manhattan; a brother, Les Honig of California; and three grandchildren. Her husband, Ted U. Klein, died last year.       
         Tove Jansson, a Finnish author and artist whose tales for children about a family of trolls called the Moomins have been popular in many countries, died on June 27 in Helsinki. She was 86 and lived much of her later life on a rocky Finnish island.         As the German magazine Der Spiegel recalled: ''When she was 15, an uncle threatened her with the Moomin troll, who he said lurked at night in the pantry. But the imaginative Finnish girl did not let herself be intimidated.''         Ms. Jansson went on to invent her own Moomins, who dwell in the Moominvalley. They are cartoon characters: tubby, torpid, lazy and fond of sleep. They are also prepared for adventure, which they have lots of.         Her first Moomin book to be translated into English, under the title ''Comet in Moominland,'' was published in Swedish in 1945. It is about the Moomins' efforts to protect themselves from a comet, and it was called ''a gentle, offbeat fantasy'' by The Horn Book, a Boston-based journal of reviews and essays about children's books.         The Moomin books have been translated into more than 30 languages, including Lithuanian, Persian, Welsh and Korean.         Ms. Jansson wrote eight novels and four picture books about the Moomins that came out between 1945 and 1970. The trolls' charm has proved durable and has also enthralled adults. Publishers Weekly said the book ''Moominland Midwinter,'' about one Moomin's roving while others hibernate, would ''hook readers of all ages.'' (It was first published in English in 1958.)         When Ms. Jansson's ''Moominsummer Madness,'' in which the Moomins are threatened by floodwaters, came out in the United States in 1961, Pamela Marsh wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Ms. Jansson had created ''an entirely new world full of cheery dauntless little creatures.''         Farrar, Straus & Giroux began reissuing the Moomin books in 1989 and has seven Moomin novels, all with black-and-white illustrations by Ms. Jansson, in print.         In 1992 Alison Lurie said in The New York Review of Books that ''Jansson's simple language, comic gift and down-to-earth relation of odd events'' were reminiscent of writing by A. A. Milne, who wrote ''Winnie-the-Pooh.''         The Moomins became so popular that demand grew for spinoff products. Ms. Jansson recalled in 1963, ''I made designs for wallpapers, paper dolls, ceramics, chocolates, candles, cloths, curtains, towels, pens, records, jewelry, postcards and I don't know what all.''         The Moomins have also appeared in comic strips and on postage stamps. They have been seen on film, in an animated television series in Japan and in theater and opera. They have been heard on radio and have been made into dolls.         In her later years Ms. Jansson was active as an artist. Her work was seen in exhibitions and included paintings for a children's hospital in Helsinki and decorative commissions in other buildings, among them the town hall in Helsinki.         During that period she also wrote short stories and novels for adults as well as reminiscences.         Tove Marika Jansson was born in Helsinki to a Finnish family that spoke Swedish. Her father, Viktor, was a sculptor, and her mother, Signe Hammarsten-Jansson, was a versatile designer.         Tove Jansson spent her childhood in Helsinki and went on to study book design in Stockholm and painting in Helsinki, Paris and Florence.         The many honors she received include the Hans Christian Andersen Medal from the International Board on Books for Young People in 1966 for her contribution to children's literature.       
         Kim Stanley, whose infrequent but luminous stage portraits brought her to the edge of greatness, but who ultimately shrank from the pressures of performance and stardom, died yesterday at a hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 76 and lived in Santa Fe.         She died after a prolonged illness, said her daughter Rachel Ryder Zahn.         In plays like William Inge's ''Picnic,'' Horton Foote's ''Traveling Lady'' and, especially, Inge's ''Bus Stop,'' Ms. Stanley captivated Broadway audiences and dazzled the critics in roles that ranged from a gauche young tomboy to a gallant abandoned wife to a well-traveled wisecracking nightclub singer.         She seemed able to take on almost any part and make it come convincingly alive. In the 1955 ''Bus Stop,'' she played Cherie, a worn-at-the-edges nightclub singer -- she calls herself a chanteuse -- who finds herself sitting out a snowstorm in a Kansas diner with her fellow bus passengers, one of whom is a swaggering cowboy. Their sparring not only won laughs, but also touched the heart.         Ms. Stanley, who later admitted to being tone deaf, even managed a deftly comic rendition of ''That Old Black Magic.'' Brooks Atkinson, in The New York Times, summed up her work as superb and called it a ''glowing performance that is full of amusing detail -- cheap, ignorant, bewildered, but also radiant with personality.''         Ms. Stanley had already won accolades two years earlier as the hoydenish teenager Millie Owens in ''Picnic.'' Then, cast as Georgette Thomas, a young mother whose husband has deserted her in Mr. Foote's 1954 drama ''The Traveling Lady,'' Ms. Stanley so dominated the stage that she was given star billing two days after the play's premiere.         There were more good reviews for her stage work in the years that followed. She appeared in ''A Clearing in the Woods,'' ''A Touch of the Poet,'' ''Cheri,'' ''A Far Country'' and ''The Three Sisters,'' among other plays, but nothing came close to her success in ''Bus Stop'' except her performance in the 1958 film ''The Goddess,'' one of her rare forays into Hollywood.         In that film Ms. Stanley won praise as a glamorous actress whose life is emotionally barren, managing to project glamour even though she was quick to concede she was no celluloid siren. She soon decided she did not much like acting for the cameras. The fragmented nature of movie making frustrated her. It was, she said, like ''shooting pool in the dark.''         Kim Stanley, whose original name was Patricia Reid, was born on Feb. 11, 1925, in Tularosa, N.M. Her parents were divorced when she was a young girl, and she and her three brothers were raised by her mother, an interior decorator who moved the family from New Mexico to Texas. Often lonely as a child, she wrote poetry and dreamed of becoming an artist or, at the very least, the local May Queen. She acted in school plays, attended the University of New Mexico and eventually graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Texas.         Her acting experiences in school had kindled a spark, she later said, but she was still thinking of pursuing a graduate degree and perhaps a career in medicine. Then she was approached by a director of the Pasadena Playhouse, who by chance had seen her perform in a college production and offered her a scholarship. She stayed at the California theater only a year, but it was enough to change the course of her life. The compass pointed toward Broadway.         After a season of walk-ons with a stock company in Louisville, Ky., where she'd gone at the urging of a friend who was working there, she boarded a Greyhound bus for New York. After a few fruitless months of making the rounds, talking to agents and trying to see producers, she turned to modeling dresses and then worked as a waitress at a hotel. She also went through a brief marriage to another aspiring actor, Bruce Hall.         The Off Broadway theater was in its infancy, but Ms. Stanley (she had taken her maternal grandmother's maiden name some years before) took an unpaid job with a Greenwich Village group called the Interplayers and lived off the money she had earned as a model. She met other promising newcomers, among them Gene Saks, Sidney Lumet and Michael V. Gazzo (later to write ''A Hatful of Rain'') and soon found herself in a new group called Off Broadway Inc.         She joined the Actors Studio, where she met and worked with the Studio's guru, Lee Strasberg, and later described him as the person ''who made it possible for the whole world to open up for me.'' Method acting, she said, was the key to becoming ''as free as possible.''         In 1949 she put her training to work at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, acting opposite Anthony Franciosa in Gertrude Stein's ''Yes Is for a Very Young Man,'' a production that drew good reviews and calls from theatrical agents. More good notices followed her next appearance, as St. Joan at the Equity Library Theater, and when the producer Kermit Bloomgarden called to invite her to replace Julie Harris in Lillian Hellman's ''Montserrat,'' she made the leap to Broadway.         Ms. Stanley married for the second time in 1949, to another actor, Curt Conway, with whom she had a son, Jamison, and a daughter, Lisa, and soon found herself torn between the conflicting demands of family and career. Performance pressures also began to take their toll, and even after her shining success in ''Bus Stop,'' stories began to circulate about her profound malaise each night at curtain time. By 1957 she had been though another divorce and remarriage, this time to the actor and director Alfred Ryder, by whom she had another daughter, Rachel. Her children survive her, along with a brother, Justin, and three grandchildren.         By the end of the 50's there were other signs of trouble. In 1958 she appeared with Helen Hayes and the British actor Eric Portman in ''A Touch of the Poet'' by Eugene O'Neill. Atkinson hailed Ms. Stanley and Ms. Hayes as ''the two finest actresses of their respective generations.'' Nevertheless, after opening night Ms. Stanley missed a number of performances. It was no secret by then that she and Portman were not on speaking terms, and it was no great surprise when Ms. Stanley abruptly left the play, blaming Portman for slapping her in one scene with what she said was excessive enthusiasm. Portman in turn declared, ''I don't go bashing people in the face,'' but Ms. Stanley was gone for good.         Such conflicts aside, she was still working at perfecting her art. ''To keep it fresh, I try to begin all over again in each performance,'' she told an interviewer. In 1959 she played a middle-aged woman in love with a handsome 19-year-old (Horst Buchholz) in ''Cherie,'' adapted by Anita Loos from two novels by Colette and set in France in the years just before and after World War I. Atkinson found her performance ''magnetic and illuminating.'' Two years later, in Henry Denker's semi-documentary 1961 play ''A Far Country,'' directed by her husband, Alfred Ryder, Ms. Stanley won praise as a young woman afflicted by hysterical paralysis who is helped by the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud.         In 1964 Ms. Stanley returned to the source of her first inspiration as an actress and appeared as Masha in an  Actors Studio Theater production of Chekhov's ''Three Sisters,'' directed by her old mentor, Lee Strasberg, and co-starring Geraldine Page and Shirley Knight. It was to be Ms. Stanley's last appearance on the New York stage.         The same year, in the British film thriller ''Seance on a Wet Afternoon,'' her portrayal of a sinister London medium who, with her compliant husband (Richard Attenborough), schemes to kidnap a child, won her rave reviews and an Oscar nomination as best actress. Writing in The Times, Bosley Crowther described Ms. Stanley's portrait of the woman as ''a humble, cloying shrew -- an insidiously diabolic creature, and yet a pitiful victim.'' She did not win an Oscar, although the New York Film Critics gave her their best actress award. Moviegoers were not to see her again for 18 years.         In little more than a decade she had established herself as one of Broadway's most brilliant actresses although, oddly, she never won a Tony Award. She had a number of television appearances to her credit, appearing in various dramatic series and winning an Emmy in 1963 for her work in a ''Ben Casey'' episode about mercy killing. But there were only the two Hollywood films, ''The Goddess'' and ''Seance.'' And for a long while that was the sum of her career: brilliant but all too brief. She returned to her native New Mexico, put aside the stresses of performing, did some teaching in Santa Fe and nursed her ambition to have her own ensemble of actors.         By 1979, however, she was back in New York as artistic director of a troupe of actors in a small theater in SoHo. ''I want to be involved with the great plays,'' she told an interviewer, and admitted that she missed acting and intended to act again. For one thing, she said, ''before I get too old, I'd like to do Hedda Gabler,'' and, she added, she wanted to make ''a serious film about Virginia Woolf.''         As it turned out, she did neither, but she did return to films in 1982 in ''Frances,'' in which she played the ambitious, devouring mother of the actress Frances Farmer (Jessica Lange). Her performance brought her a second Oscar nomination, this time for best supporting actress. The next year, she had a small part as a barnstorming pilot in ''The Right Stuff.'' And she returned to television in 1984, winning her second Emmy in the role of Big Mama in a PBS production of Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' with Ms. Lange and Tommy Lee Jones.         There the story ended. Ms. Stanley spent her last years quietly, back in New Mexico. ''You can't be good in the theater unless you've immersed yourself in the marvelous detective story of the human spirit,'' she once told an interviewer. ''But it's difficult, terribly difficult.''         In her case the mystery remained unsolved. She had, in effect, achieved her childhood dream of becoming the May Queen, but chose to leave the parade before its end.         Correction:  August 27, 2001, Monday  An obituary of the actress Kim Stanley on Tuesday misstated the surname of her son and misidentified his father. The son changed his name to Jamison Clift from Conway in the 1980's. His father was William Brooks Clift Jr., not Ms. Stanley's second husband, Curt Conway.         The obituary also omitted a film credit for Ms. Stanley. The Actors Studio production of ''The Three Sisters'' in which she played Masha was videotaped in 1965 and transferred to film and released in 1977.       
         Aaliyah, a multimillion-selling, precociously sultry rhythm-and-blues singer and actress, died on Saturday in the crash of a small airplane, The Associated Press reported. She was returning from Abaco Island in the Bahamas, where she had been making a video clip, to Miami in a private plane, which crashed on takeoff. Eight other passengers were also killed. Aaliyah was 22 years old.         Aaliyah Haughton was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Detroit. She began singing as a child and performed in Las Vegas with Gladys Knight when she was 11.         Barry Hankerson, Aaliyah's uncle, is Ms. Knight's former husband and was the manager of R. Kelly, who specializes in amorous, slow-grind rhythm-and-blues.         Aaliyah was 14 when she made her first album, ''Age Ain't Nothing but a Number,'' which was produced by Mr. Kelly and released in 1994. It sold a million copies and included two Top 10 singles, ''Back and Forth'' and ''At Your Best (You Are Love).'' Aaliyah toured the world through 1994 and 1995.         She also attended Detroit High School for the Fine and Performing Arts, majoring in dance, and she released her second album, ''One in a Million,'' as she began her senior year in 1996. It was produced by Timbaland (Tim Mosely), whose syncopated, fractured rhythm tracks made him an influential figure in 1990's pop. With guest appearances by Missy Elliott and Slick Rick, it presented Aaliyah, then 17, as a hip-hop temptress and included the hit single ''If Your Girl Only Knew.'' The album sold two million copies.         Aaliyah sang on soundtrack albums for ''Anastasia,'' ''Next Friday,'' ''Music of the Heart,'' ''Sunset Park'' and ''Dr. Dolittle,'' and had a No. 1 rhythm-and-blues hit in 1998 with the song ''Are You That Somebody'' from ''Dr. Dolittle.''         Aaliyah was featured in the movie ''Romeo Must Die'' in 2000 and was an executive producer for its soundtrack album, which included her hit single ''Try Again.'' She played the title role in the film of the Anne Rice novel ''Queen of the Damned,'' due for release next year, and had been set to appear in ''The Matrix 2.'' Her third album, ''Aaliyah,'' was released in July and reached No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart.         She is survived by her parents, Diane and Michael Haughton, and a brother, Rashaad.       
         Diana Golden Brosnihan, who lost a leg to cancer at 12, won a gold medal in disabled skiing at the 1988 Calgary Olympics and played a key role in public appreciation of disabled athletes, died Saturday at a hospital in Providence, R.I. She was 38.         Her cancer returned in 1992 and again in 1997.         ''I like to live each day like an adventure,'' she once said.         She did that so well that Sports Illustrated once wrote that she was ''most likely to be remembered as the woman who, perhaps more than any other athlete, brought crossover credibility to the disabled sports movement.''         She was inducted into the Women's Sports Foundation International Hall of Fame in 1997. The citation read, ''She persuaded the ski world to treat all athletes the same, regardless of ability or, in her case, disability.'' She was also inducted into the National Ski Hall of Fame that year.         Brosnihan, who grew up in Lincoln, Mass., outside Boston, learned to ski at 5. At 12, she developed bone cancer in her right leg, resulting in amputation above the knee. When she awakened after surgery, her first words were, ''Will I still be able to ski?'' Six months later, she was skiing.         As a high school sophomore, she discovered that she could jog on crutches. In her junior year, the high school ski coach asked her to join the team. She did, and a year later she won the downhill in the world handicapped championships.         ''If you had ever told me that I would make being an athlete my profession, I would have laughed at you, and my family would have laughed at you,'' she once said. ''It was not even a dream.'' But it became a reality. It also became an albatross, and from 1982 to 1985, she took two and a half years off from skiing.         ''It gave me time to find my identity apart from my skiing so that when I came back to skiing it was something I wanted to do for me and not because I needed that image from other people,'' she said.         She used one ski and two outriggers (forearm crutches with ski tips attached). Later, never using an artificial leg, she abandoned the outriggers in favor of regular ski poles so she could go faster.         She rejoined the national disabled team and persuaded potential corporate sponsors to support the team as they would any other. She persuaded the United States Ski Association to allow disabled skiers to compete in national championships against able-bodied skiers.         That open-competition policy became known as the Golden Rule, and she took advantage of it. She might finish last, 20 seconds behind a renowned skier like Tamara McKinney, but said she would come closer next time. She often did.         Against other disabled skiers, her success was overwhelming. From 1986 to 1990, she won 10 world and 19 United States championships. In the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, when disabled skiing was a demonstration sport, she won the gold medal in the giant slalom. The United States Olympic Committee voted her the female skier of the year, ahead of able-bodied skiers.         In 1991, the Women's Sports Foundation gave her the Flo Hyman award, which had previously gone to Martina Navratilova, Evelyn Ashford, Jackie Joyner-Kersee and Chris Evert.         That year, she retired (for the last time) from competition and took up rock climbing and mountaineering. Then the cancer returned, leading to bilateral mastectomies, the loss of her uterus and an attempted suicide. Again, she turned herself around, climbed Mount Rainier and continued as a motivational speaker.         In 1997, the cancer returned again and spread to her spine, pelvis and lungs. She stopped giving motivational speeches, saying she could not be upbeat anymore and could not force a smile.         At Dartmouth, where she received a degree in English literature in 1984, she casually met Steve Brosnihan, who became a freelance cartoonist for New England newspapers. They met again in 1996 and were married in August 1997 between her chemotherapy sessions.         She is survived by her husband, of Bristol, R.I., her mother, a brother and a sister.         To the end, Brosnihan fought for dignified treatment and perceptions of the disabled. ''You think about women,'' she said, ''and people used to pat us on the back and say: 'Isn't that sweet? She's competing.' Now they don't do that anymore. It's the same with the disabled. People treat us with dignity.         ''To me it has to do with the dignity of each person. Each person is worthy of respect, so it's a matter of if I choose to live with that dignity myself.         ''Sometimes, stereotypes make me laugh. Like when people introduce you as courageous. Often, I've heard it on television, 'We're talking with a girl today who had cancer when she was 12, beat the odds and now she skis.' I say: 'Now wait a minute. I don't just ski. I'm the best in the world and I train my heart and soul out for this and I ski 150 days and I work out in the weight room, and to me courageous doesn't imply any of that.'         ''Athletes don't want to be courageous. They want to be good.''         In 1988, she skied on screen for three minutes in a feature-length movie, ''Escape to Ski.'' Warren Miller, who made the film, became an instant fan.         ''After you're with her for a few minutes, you totally forget her handicap,'' he said. ''She has her act together, and it's not an act.''       
         Jane Greer, whose dolorous but luminous dark eyes and world-weary beauty made her the ideal femme fatale opposite Robert Mitchum in ''Out of the Past'' and ''The Big Steal,'' film noir classics of the 1940's, died Friday in Los Angeles.  She was 76.         The cause was complications of cancer, her son Alex Lasker said.  When ''Out of the Past'' was remade 37 years later as ''Against All Odds,'' she came out of semi-retirement to play the mother of the character she had originally played in 1947.         She was never a big star, at least not by the standards of her day, and she was mostly relegated to melodramas. But when a later generation of movie buffs became attracted to Hollywood's black-and-white twisty yarns of the 1940's, they were quite taken by Miss Greer, whose face was best viewed through cigarette smoke in a bar.         In ''Out of the Past,'' she appears with both Mitchum and Kirk Douglas, who plays the heavy, Mitchum's former employer. Mitchum is trying to forget about his shabby past but is recruited by his old boss and ordered to Mexico to find Miss Greer.         The movie's crosses and double- crosses were nowhere nearly as opaque as those of ''The Maltese Falcon,'' but when Bosley Crowther reviewed it for The New York Times, he wrote that its 97 minutes of back stabbing and double-dealing were such that they had to be ''reckoned by logarithmic tables.''         Bettejane Greer was born on Sept. 9, 1924, in Washington. She started her show business career as a big band singer. During World War II, when she was about 19, her mother, who worked for the War Department, saw to it that Jane was one of three young women selected to model uniforms for the new Women's Army Corps.         Howard Hughes, the movie maker with a legendary affinity for beautiful women, saw her photograph and signed her to a personal contract. He made it clear that he didn't want her to marry anyone.         ''I found him rather endearing, like a child,''Miss Greer said of Hughes in one interview. ''His idea was to go to the amusement park,'' she said, adding, ''He won a large collection of Kewpie dolls for me.''         The photograph of Miss Greer in a WAC uniform was published in Life magazine, where it attracted the attention of Rudy Vallee, the crooner.  He called Life and tried unsuccessfully to get her address.         He found it anyhow, and proposed after a whirlwind courtship. Miss Greer accepted. The marriage lasted from 1943 to 1945. Miss Greer dropped the ''Bette'' from her name, and since she didn't think that Mr. Hughes had been using her to her best advantage at R.K.O., bought back her contract for $7,572, payable at $25 a week. When she was almost paid up, she asked Mr. Hughes to forgive the last $50. He refused.         She married Edward Lasker in 1947, the same year she made ''Out of the Past'' and ''They Won't Believe Me,'' with Robert Young and Susan Hayward; they were later divorced.         Among her other movies were ''I Married a Communist'' (1949) with Paul Lukas and Robert Ryan; ''Somebody Loves Me'' (1952), ''Down Among the Sheltering Palms'' (1952) and ''Run for the Sun'' (1956) with Richard Widmark and Trevor Howard, all made at MGM.         In 1957, she also appeared with James Cagney in ''Man of a Thousand Faces,'' the story of Lon Chaney, the silent star. After ''Billie,'' which she made in 1965 with Patty Duke and Jim Backus, she made few movies.         In addition to her son Alex, she is survived by two other sons, Lawrence and Steve; a twin brother, Don, and two grandchildren. Her companion, Frank London, an acting coach, died in January.         Years later, when one of her sons told her that she was ''Queen of Film Noir,'' she told him she really didn't know what film noir was.       
         Elizabeth Bliss Parkinson Cobb, a vital and effective presence at the Museum of Modern Art in New York for nearly 70 years, died on Aug. 24 in Hightstown, N.J. She was 93 and lived in Hightstown.         Best known as Eliza Parkinson, Ms. Cobb was a niece of Lillie Bliss, one of the museum's founders, and a stepdaughter of the museum's first president, A. Conger Goodyear.         After being invited in her early 20's by Nelson Rockefeller to be a member of the museum's fledgling Junior Advisory Committee, she soon began to seek out and enlist energetic young people, many of whom were to be part of a new generation of informed and active supporters of the museum.         Agnes Gund, president of the museum, said on Monday, ''Though she was not herself able to collect on the scale of either her aunt or her stepfather, she came to feel so deeply for the museum's collections in all their variety that she regarded every one of them as her own.''         Each aspect of the museum's encyclopedic activity fascinated her. She also took pride in adventurous outposts, like the Celeste Bartos Film Preservation Center in Hamlin, Pa., which saves the Modern's movie collection from decay.         In 1939, Eliza Parkinson was appointed a trustee of the museum. Thereafter, except for service with the Red Cross during World War II, she served on the board uninterruptedly. She was president of the museum from 1965 to 1968, was vice-chairwoman from 1968 to 1993, and was named a life trustee in 1993.         As chairwoman of the building committee from 1968 to 1977, she was instrumental in decisions on how to expand the premises. ''Eliza cared so strongly for the history and for the memory of the museum,'' Ms. Gund said, ''that she could not bear to think of its being divided into two separate branches in New York. She loved every stone in those buildings and every leaf in its garden.''         Eliza Parkinson was also a prime mover in the museum's international council, which in effect gave the museum worldwide status. She was credited with an almost ambassadorial gift for diplomacy. Chairwoman of the council's membership committee in its early days, she later served as its vice chairwoman and, from 1957 to 1966, as its president. Those were the years in which postwar American painting first came to widespread international notice.         They were also the years in which the museum came to be ranked as the father and grandfather of modern-art museums the world over. Had it not been for the pivotal shows the Modern sent to Australia, Ms. Gund said, Jackson Pollock's ''Blue Poles'' might not be in the National Gallery in Canberra today.         Ms. Cobb's first husband, John Parkinson Jr., died in 1973. Her second husband, Henry Ives Cobb, died in 1999.         She is survived by a son, John Parkinson III, who was appointed a trustee of the museum in 1976 and is its treasurer; a daughter, the pianist Zaidee Parkinson; five grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.       
         Lillian Kiesler, an artist, art patron and the widow of the sculptor and avant-garde architect Frederick Kiesler, died on July 25 in Manhattan. She was 91.         Ms. Kiesler studied painting with Hans Hofmann in New York in the 1930's and was introduced to her future husband by the artist Burgoyne Diller. As a couple, they were friends with many of the leading figures in the New York art world.         After her husband's death in 1965, Ms. Kiesler organized his work and papers and placed them at Harvard, Yale and in the Archives of American Art. In 1996 she helped establish the Frederick and Lillian Kiesler Foundation, a study center in Vienna. Four years ago she established the Austrian Frederick Kiesler Prize for a distinguished figure in architecture or the related arts. The architect Frank O. Gehry was the first recipient, the multimedia artist Judith Barry the second.         Ms. Kiesler also performed in theater pieces by artists like Steve Buscemi and John Jesurun, often appearing with her companion, Maryette Charlton, who survives her.         She taught art education at New York University and worked in various media throughout her life. Galerie Valerie on the Lower East Side  is planning a retrospective of her paintings, sculptures and objects.       
         Alix Williamson, a classical music publicist who helped promote and shape the careers of legendary musicians from Lotte Lehmann to the Trapp Family Singers, died on Sunday at her home in New York. She was 85.         Ms. Williamson built brand names for many artists and organizations, from André Watts and Frederica von Stade at the start of their careers to Richard Tucker at the end of his. Her involvement with her clients extended far beyond promotion. .         It was she who suggested to the Baroness Maria von Trapp that she write a book about her family's experiences. The resulting book inspired the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical ''The Sound of Music.''         She also acted as impresario for the Juilliard String Quartet and the Waverly Consort in their Alice Tully Hall series.         Born in New York City on April 6, 1916, Ms. Williamson graduated from Hunter College and worked as a reporter for The New York Journal-American before entering public relations as an account executive at Constance Hope Associates.         She continued to write throughout her life, ghost-writing a range of books, including a sentimental novel, and writing ''Mother Is Minnie,'' a biography of Minnie Guggenheimer, founder of the Lewisohn Stadium concerts in Manhattan, under her own name in 1960.         In her half-century as a publicist, she represented artists and organizations including Lauritz Melchior, Lily Pons, Ezio Pinza, Astrid Varnay, Jennie Tourel, Helen Traubel, Rosalyn Tureck, Grace Bumbry and the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, from its inception. She occasionally promoted artists represented by her husband, Joseph A. Lippman, an artists' manager with the Herbert Barrett agency.         At the time of her death she was writing her memoirs and continuing to work on a few accounts. One was Vincent la Selva and the New York Grand Opera, which recently completed a complete cycle of Verdi's operas in Central Park, an achievement for which Ms. Williamson helped get them a citation in the  Guinness Book of World Records.         She is survived by a daughter, Victoria McKee of London, and two grandchildren.       
         THERE is no saying no to Caroline H. Newhouse. But you wouldn't know it upon meeting the matriarch of the Newhouse  family in the formal sitting room of her Park Avenue apartment. She sits on a plush sofa, a well-coiffed little woman of 91, ever so sweet, so demure.         But don't let her fool you. This is one tough lady.         Just ask the many wealthy relatives whom she has ordered to fan out into the philanthropic world, assigning them to various boards and charities, even making her pitch at the family Thanksgiving dinner. (She waits until cocktails are over.)         Mrs. Newhouse is an aunt of  S. I. Newhouse Jr., the multibillionaire chairman of Condé Nast Publications. She is the widow of Theodore Newhouse, one of three brothers who founded one of the nation's biggest communications conglomerates. She has become the grande dame of charities in her family.         There was that time when Mrs. Newhouse, as an original board member of the New York City Opera, informed sorrowful board members that she planned on retiring, but she told them, rather drily, not to worry. She'd find them another Newhouse. She called up her nephew Mark Newhouse, who later became the opera board's president.         ''She didn't really offer it,'' the nephew says.  ''She pretty much told me.''         Mrs. Newhouse also put the bite on her niece  Caroline Diamond Harrison, noting pointedly that Mrs. Harrison's sister Alison Diamond Levasseur is on the junior committee of the New York City Opera, and that she too should have something to do. Mrs. Newhouse nabbed her niece for her pet charity, Career Transition for Dancers, a nonprofit group that finds new skills for retiring dancers.         ''There's no denying it,'' Mrs. Harrison says. ''She always comes out with things going the way she wants them to go.''         But in Mrs. Newhouse's apartment, her steely determination is not immediately apparent. She is a bit nervous, extending her hand in a sitting room surrounded by bronze sculptures of her own creation and artwork that includes a Renoir here, a little Rubens over there. Dressed in a salmon-colored pantsuit, she makes small talk about the weather, her failing eyesight. Her fingers drip with serious diamonds, and large South Sea pearls are draped around her neck. A uniformed servant materializes to offer refreshments.         MRS. NEWHOUSE is not keen to draw attention to herself or her philanthropic efforts. ''I don't like to talk about myself,'' she mutters. But her red-painted lips curl into a sly smile and she chuckles, confirming how she has indeed parceled out charity assignments to family members. ''Oh yes, they always say yes,'' she boasts. ''They all make time when I ask them to do something.''         As she rises to give a tour of her artwork, Mrs. Newhouse moves with fragile steps through the foyer with the marble checkerboard floor and into her small library. She pats the seat beside her on a sofa, coaxing up her gray Persian cat, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with luminescent orange eyes. ''Come, sweetheart, don't be bashful. Come here, Wolfie.''         She speaks with an accent still strong from her native Germany, which she left at 23. She has an Old World modesty, too. It takes her closest friend, Alexander J. Dubé, to loosen her up. Mr. Dubé, the executive director of Career Transition for Dancers, bounds into the room, jiggling coins that he found on the floor. They glance at each other conspiratorially. More money for the organization.         ''Go find some more,'' she says, holding open her palm.         Mrs. Newhouse has been particularly adroit at roping family members into involvement with Career Transition for Dancers, which has served more than 2,000 dancers since it began in 1985.         ''She makes them work,'' says  Mr. Dubé, 62, who met Mrs. Newhouse and her husband 26 years ago. ''She'll call them up and say, 'Why haven't you sold any tables for the gala?' or call them up and say, 'I want you to be my co-chair.' She goes after them, and no one says no to Aunt Caroline.''         Si Newhouse Jr.'s Condé Nast is a major underwriter of the organization's annual fund-raising gala in October. Another nephew, Jonathan Newhouse, and his wife, Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, have flown in from London, where they live, to be chairman and chairwoman of the benefits.         Mrs. Newhouse has donated $1 million to establish a permanent home and created a scholarship fund that has given away more than $1 million. She never studied dance herself, but often used dancers as models. She says they taught her much about their short careers, facing retirement on average around 30, or when they are injured. ''They're lost, because when you are a dancer you have no time to do anything else but dance,'' she says.         Mrs. Newhouse retired from sculpturing in her mid-70's. She began studying the arts in Germany. She was one of three children raised by her mother after her father, a military officer, was killed in World War I. She says she inherited her spirit of giving from her mother.         She met her future husband at a New Hampshire resort. When he told her he sold newspapers, she thought he owned a kiosk or hawked newspapers as a street vendor. They married a  year later, in 1956.         Mrs. Newhouse thinks she and the Newhouse family are a good match. ''They are so warm and giving, and they respect me because I am the oldest. I am the matriarch.''         Still, she won't let them off the hook when it comes to her charities.         ''They have never said no to me yet.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Maureen Reagan, the outspoken daughter of former President Ronald Reagan who was often at odds with her father's policies, died yesterday at her home in Sacramento. She was 60, and had suffered a recurrence of melanoma, a skin cancer with which she was first diagnosed in 1996 and that, after some years in remission, recurred last fall.         Ms. Reagan was a politically active feminist who worked to support the proposed equal rights amendment, lobbied for abortion rights and helped elect women to public office.  She had a distant relationship with her father for decades after he and  her mother, the actress Jane Wyman, divorced in 1948.         Although Ms. Reagan volunteered her services in 1966 when her father  ran for governor of California, his consultants rejected her offer on the ground that her participation would again bring Mr. Reagan's divorce to the attention of the public. She recalled a news release at the time that said Mr. Reagan and his wife Nancy, whom he married in 1952, had had two children, Patti and Ronnie, and did not mention her or her brother Michael.         A thaw between father and daughter began when Mr. Reagan ran for president in 1980.         ''When he was elected president, she had more communication and involvement with her father than she had had for the rest of her life,'' her friend Judy Carter, the daughter-in-law of former President Jimmy Carter, said in 1989.         Ms. Reagan, too, tried her hand at politics. She was twice defeated in Republican primary races in California, for the United States Senate in 1982 and for a Southern California Congressional seat in 1992. Her first campaign was undermined by reports that her father, then president, did not want her involved in the race, but a decade later he endorsed her Congressional run.         To accusations that she was trading on the Reagan name, she said, ''I don't run because of my name but I don't run from it.'' She noted that people who accused her of exploiting family ties ''forget I was a Republican before the president was.''         ''I licked my first envelope in 1960,'' Ms. Reagan said, ''and I've never stopped working.''         She said that as an 11-year-old watching television coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, she preferred the Republicans ''because they were better organized.''         At an even younger age, she exhibited the traits for which she was known throughout her life: strong will and impatience. As one of her critics once said, she was ''simply not schooled in the ways of holding her tongue.''         In 1987, after the Iran-contra affair, when Ms. Reagan asserted that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's national security aides,  should be court-martialed for their actions, Mr. Reagan told Republican leaders, ''I gave up arguing with my daughter long ago.''         Maureen Elizabeth Reagan was born on Jan. 4, 1941, and in her early school years attended the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., as a boarder. She went to Emerson Junior High School in Los Angeles and to high school at Immaculate Heart in Hollywood. After a year at Marymount College of Virginia in Arlington she dropped out because, she said, ''I wanted to do something, be somewhere, I wanted to be an actress, and to be one, you had to know something of the world.''         When she left school, her father  told her, ''Well, write if you get work.''         The work she got was as a secretary in Washington, where she also took part in local theater. She soon returned to the West, to Las Vegas and California, where she sang in nightclubs, did a few commercials (Duncan Hines and Crisco) and had bit parts in television shows (''The Partridge Family'' and ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'') and in the 1964 Elvis Presley movie ''Kissin' Cousins.'' In her 1989 book, ''First Father, First Daughter,'' (Little, Brown & Company), Ms. Reagan recalled, ''I went out on so many auditions I began to think of changing my middle name to Rejection.''         Her brief television and movie career was followed by a stint as a talk show host on KABC Radio in Los Angeles, and in 1969 she joined a U.S.O. tour of Vietnam.         By 1980, Ms. Reagan was director of an organization called Sell Overseas America, which promoted American products abroad, a position she resigned two years later to pursue her Senate campaign.         Ms. Reagan's book revealed that she had been the victim of domestic  violence in her first marriage, in 1960, to John Filippone, a Washington policeman. The marriage lasted barely a year. A 1964 marriage to David Sills, a Marine lieutenant, ended in divorce in 1968.         Her husband of 20 years, Dennis Revell, a public relations executive in Sacramento, survives her as does a daughter, Rita, whom the couple adopted from Uganda in 1994. In addition to her father, stepmother and siblings, she is also survived by her mother.         Although she was an ardent Republican, Ms. Reagan angered many members of the party by her refusal to compromise and for stepping on toes. In 1983, she was given the title of special consultant to the Republican National Committee and moved to the family quarters in the White House.         When asked if she had been happy with her father's record on women's issues , she said: ''No, I haven't. I think there could be a much better record and I would certainly place the blame, I think, where it belongs. That's in the hands of certain people on the senior staff, who have never really accepted that there is a political power of women and that has to be addressed.''         Larry Speakes, a White House spokesman in the Reagan administration, noted in his book ''Speaking Out,'' that the president's aides, including Secretary of State George P. Shultz, were afraid of Ms. Reagan, known to many as Big Mo.         ''You would avoid her if possible and agree with her if you had to deal with her,'' Mr. Speakes wrote.         Ms. Reagan's most active political years were in the 1980's, when she was a member of the California World Trade Commission, chairwoman of the United States delegation to the United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Kenya, in 1985; co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and chairwoman of the Republican Women's Political Action League.         As Ms. Reagan became more influential, she worked to increase Republican fund-raising for women running for office.         Ms. Reagan said she first recognized the symptoms of Alzheimer's in her father in 1994 when he was unable to recall the part he had played in a movie. ''Actors always remember the roles they played,'' she said. She joined the Alzheimer's Association board and began traveling the country to raise research money.         Her personal and political creed was perhaps best summed up in a 1982 interview. ''People who hurt my friends I have a lot of trouble forgiving,'' she said. ''People who hurt me I tend to forgive but I never forget.''       
         Nora Sayre, a film critic and essayist best known for her commentary on the cultural effects of the cold war -- died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was emphysema, said Mary Sayre Haverstock, her cousin.         As the child of parents who knew both the New York and Hollywood writing scenes, Ms. Sayre witnessed firsthand the struggles of writers in the crosswinds of America's anti-Communist fervor, which she later insisted both preceded and continued long after the era of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's red-hunting in the early 1950's. In ''Running Time: Films of the Cold War'' (1982, Dial Press), her second book, she analyzed the effect of this fervor on Hollywood movie-making in the 1950's.         In her next book, ''Previous Convictions: A Journey Through the 1950's'' (1995, Rutgers University Press), she dug deeper into the period. ''The readiness to challenge and then contradict official wisdom was supposed to be an American tradition,'' she wrote, ''but that kind of autonomy was rare in the 1950's, and I was fortunate to come of age among people who took their independence for granted.''         Reviewing ''Previous Convictions,'' David Caute, a historian of anti-Communism, described Ms. Sayre as ''an essayist whose light touch masks the formidable weight of her judgments'' and whose ''natural province is not so much history as people's consciousness.'' He continued, ''Her fault is sometimes to seek out complications which may not be there -- as in her accounts of former Communists who still feel they were right to be wrong -- but this flaw is no doubt reinforced by her affection for individuals she meets and her refusal to accept any aspect of American cold war ideology.''         Nora Clemens Sayre was born on Sept. 20, 1932, in Hamilton, Bermuda, the only child of Joel Sayre, a staff writer and war correspondent for The New Yorker and occasional Hollywood screenwriter -- he wrote ''Annie Oakley'' (1935) for Barbara Stanwyck and was a co-writer on ''Gunga Din'' (1939) -- and Gertrude (Lynahan) Sayre, a reporter for The New York World. Ms. Sayre attended the Putney School, in Vermont, graduating in 1950, and Radcliffe College, where, as she later described herself, she was apolitical and hung out with the aesthetes and actors who founded the Poets' Theater in Cambridge, and where she graduated cum laude in 1954.         ''Like a lot of my generation, I grew up with no politics at all,'' she told Brian Close, a student at the Columbia Journalism School, in a recent interview. ''I didn't even read the newspaper. Mine was a rather liberated family. But it was a very square time. Even the freest spirts were cautious. Clearly life was safer and easier if you had no politics.''         In 1955, the year after her graduation from Radcliffe, she took off for Europe with an eye to ''blotting out,'' she later reported, her parents' unhappy marriage and her mother's suicidal depressions. In London, wafted by her parents' literary connections, she met the likes of Arthur Koestler, his lover the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard (future wife of Kingsley Amis), James Thurber, A. J. Liebling, Walker Evans, Cyril Connolly, Henry Green, Graham Greene and Charlie and Oona Chaplin. She also met members of the American community in exile -- targets of Hollywood blacklisting and the United States' anti-communist campaign -- which was centered around Frognal, the house of Donald Ogden Stewart and Ella Winter, his Australian-born wife.         It was in England that she became more politically aware -- ''they may have more of a vigorous opposition than we do,'' she told Mr. Close -- and realized she was ''somewhat of a lefty.'' As she reports in her recently published memoir of that time, ''On the Wing: A Young American Abroad'' (2001, Counterpoint), she was often considered fair game by sexually avaricious older writers.         Under the tutelage of the literary critic John Davenport, she began to write for publication. As she recalled in ''On the Wing,'' ''He would arrive for an unscheduled lunch in my Bourne Street basement, bringing bacon and frozen string beans and books and imperatives: 'Why don't you eat this, read this, write about that.' Soon these editorial sessions were part of my London week: he read my pieces before I submitted them -- plucking out passages that needed polishing but never suggesting any words of his own'' and ''instilling a horror of clichés.''         She landed a job writing book reviews for The New Statesman. ''I don't want to give too much credit to the Brits because I am no Anglophile,'' she told Mr. Close, ''but they give a writer so much more freedom, especially then.'' Ms. Sayre eventually returned to the United States in the early 1960's. She had been through a brief, unsuccessful marriage to Robert Neild, a former Royal Air Force pilot, a lecturer in economics at Cambridge and a rising figure in the Labor Party.         Ms. Sayre served as New York correspondent for the New Statesman from 1965 until 1970. Her first book, a collection of pieces titled ''Sixties Going on Seventies'' (Rutgers University Press) -- which covered everything from student strikes and yippies to the 1972 Democratic and Republican Conventions  -- led to her employment at The New York Times in 1973 when her book was recommended to Arthur Gelb, then managing editor of the paper, as deserving of a review. Mr. Gelb was inspired by it to appoint her movie reviewer for The Times.         She left The Times in 1975 and for the next seven years worked as a freelancer, writing for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation, The Progressive and Esquire, among other publications, and winning a Guggenheim fellowship, 1975-76, and a National Endowment for the Arts grant, 1978. ''I managed for those seven years to break even with no other income at all,'' she told Mr. Close. ''I was able to travel. I was able to go to the dentist.'' She added: ''Freelancer has become a very offensive term. Ten years ago it was legitimate. Maybe. Now it's just another word for 'unemployed.' ''         In 1981 she became a visiting lecturer in Columbia University's writing program. Over the course of her career she also served as a lecturer and instructor in various writing workshops, including as a participant in the visiting authors program of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, the lecture series at the Museum of Modern Art, and at the Museum of Television and Radio. She was writer in residence for a semester at James Thurber House in Columbus, Ohio, and a frequent resident at Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.         She is survived by her cousin, of Oberlin, Ohio.         Ms. Sayre was proud of having covered every presidential political convention from the time she returned to this country, and she continued to work eight hours a day up until the time she entered the hospital. Living in a New York City apartment bought for her by friends, partly to help her out and partly as an investment, she wrote drafts on yellow legal pads -- ''like Richard Nixon,'' she told Mr. Close. ''It isn't all writing,'' she explained. ''Some of it is rewriting or looking at things with a critical eye. It is very easy to fill eight hours this way.''         She described herself to Mr. Close as ''of a certain age.'' She added: ''It isn't vanity, dear, but unfortunately writers are downgraded in our earnings, based on our age. They think we become less capable of grasping things.''       
         Ethel Redner Scull, who with her husband, Robert, achieved fame and social status in the 1960's by building one of the first major collections of Pop and Minimal art and becoming the subject of an Andy Warhol portrait, died on Monday at a retirement home in Manhattan. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack followed by a stroke, her son Jonathan said.         Once an ardent partygoer and a devoted fashion buff, Mrs. Scull lived with her husband in an art-filled apartment on upper Fifth Avenue and wore creations by designers like Halston, Adolfo and Yves St. Laurent. But after the Skulls divorced in 1975, she had to curtail her way of life, eventually moving to a small one-bedroom East Side apartment.         Her parting with Scull, a taxi tycoon, after a 30-year marriage, involved her in more than a decade of litigation with him and with his estate; he died in 1986 at 70. One of her major grievances, she said, was that although she had fully participated in their art purchases, her husband tried to take sole credit for them.         After they parted in 1974, she told an interviewer in 1986, she could not get access to 35 paintings he had earlier put in storage when their apartment was being redecorated. And she had ''not enough for a sea urchin to live on,'' she said.         In the litigation she went after what she said was rightly hers: half the paintings, property and money that the couple had acquired. In 1985 a State Supreme Court justice finally awarded her a 35 percent share in Scull's art holdings, including $2.5 million worth of paintings and more than $1 million in cash from paintings sold since 1973.         Both sides met at a warehouse to divide the works in 1986. By the flip of a coin, Mrs. Scull won one of the most important, Jasper Johns's 1959 ''Out the Window.'' Later that year she sold it at auction for $3.63 million, then the highest amount paid for a work by a living artist. Calling its departure devastating, Ms. Scull said, ''I'm losing the Johns because I need money to live on.''         But prolonged physical therapy for a back injury and a penchant for spending, her son said, gradually ate up the money and her alimony. Meanwhile her active social life ground to a halt. ''When you're not giving parties and not having the big shots of the world over, you're not invited,'' she said. ''And if your name is not in the columns, you fade away from the scene.''         Besides Jonathan, of Manhattan, Mrs. Scull is survived by two other sons, Adam, of Miami Beach, and Stephen Paul, of Los Angeles; a sister, Lillian Kaplan of New York and Florida; and two grandchildren.         Ethel Redner was born in the Bronx in 1921. Her father, Ben Redner, owned a taxicab company, and she led a privileged life. A tall, striking woman with a mane of tawny hair, she met her future husband, when she was 23.         At the time she was studying advertising art at the Parsons School of Design, which she described as ''more of a finishing school then.'' In 1944, after a five-month courtship, she married Scull, who had dropped out of high school during the Depression and had an up-and-down career as a freelance illustrator and industrial designer.         At first the couple lived in a small apartment near the Museum of Modern Art, and Mrs. Scull studied at the Art Students League, where she painted realist canvases.         When her father retired, he gave shares in the business to his three sons-in-law. Within a few years Scull had built up his share into a fleet of 130 cabs with 400 drivers. By that time the couple lived in a house in Great Neck, N.Y., bought for them by Mrs. Scull's father. But the couple were culturally and socially ambitious and soon began looking for a larger theater than suburbia.         At Mrs. Scull's prompting, they found it in Manhattan, where, with the rise of Abstract Expressionism, the art world was beginning to generate glamor and profits. At first the Sculls collected Abstract Expressionists but in the early 1960's discovered a world of newer, younger artists like Warhol, Robert Morris, Mark di Suvero and Larry Poons.         In 1965 they auctioned off part of their Abstract Expressionist collection and used the money to start the Robert and Ethel Scull Foundation for the encouragement of unknown artists. It commissioned environmental works from aspirants like Walter de Maria and Michael Heizer and gave artists stipends, bought them food and clothes and paid for their materials.         Mr. Scull also backed the Green Gallery, a showplace for innovative art founded by Richard Bellamy, for the five years of its existence.         Their patronage established the Sculls, at first considered upstarts in the art world, as big-time players. Giving lavish parties themselves, they soon were celebrities.         Gossip and art writers sought them out, and Mrs. Scull regularly made the fashion pages. In 1963 Warhol did her portrait, ''Ethel Scull 36 Times,'' comprising 36 silk-screen images made from snapshots taken in a Times Square photo booth. The couple was cast in plaster by the sculptor George Segal, with Mrs. Scull wearing a Courrèges dress. They established a base in East Hampton, N.Y., then the art world's summer summit.         But in 1973, when they auctioned 50 works by up-and-coming artists for $2.2 million, at the time a record for contemporary American art, they were castigated by some artists and critics, among them Robert Rauschenberg, because they had acquired the art so cheaply. Mr. Rauschenberg accused the Sculls of infidelity and the auction house of encouraging profiteering.         Later, asked by an interviewer about accusations that he and his wife bought art for investment and for social climbing, Mr. Scull replied: ''It's all true. I'd rather use art to climb than anything else.''       
         Jane Dudley, a prominent dancer in Martha Graham's company in the 1930's and 40's who was also one of early modern dance's social-protest choreographers and a leading teacher in the United States and Britain, died on Wednesday in London. She was 89.         Ms. Dudley had lived in London since 1970, when she started to teach at the London Contemporary Dance School, founded by the Graham patron Robin Howard to further modern dance in Britain.         One of the most influential teachers of early Graham technique, she was director of contemporary dance studies at the London school until 1991, retiring from it in 1998. Although suffering from an arthritic hip and virtually crippled in her last years, she continued to choreograph. She appeared in ''Dancing Inside,'' a recent film about her work that was shown last year at the Dance on Camera festival at Lincoln Center.         Tall and powerful in her movement, with remarkably expressive long arms, Ms. Dudley was initially identified with the roles she created in some of Martha Graham's signature works. In the 1940 ''Letter to the World,'' Graham's lyrical but fierce  meditation on Emily Dickinson and her poetry, Ms. Dudley was the Ancestress, a symbol of death and of the Puritan heritage.         Ms. Graham's Emily figure was nurtured in Ms. Dudley's arms, but the same arms also separated the heroine and her lover later with amazingly powerful swings. John Martin in The New York Times reviewed Ms. Dudley in the same role in 1953. ''She is mother, conscience, death, negation, tender care,'' he wrote, ''and she manages with great eloquence, to be both cruel and compassionate.''         None of that force seemed lost in 1970 when Ms. Dudley returned as the Ancestress in a guest appearance with the Graham troupe at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. The same season featured a revival of ''Death and Entrances,'' in which Graham, Ms. Dudley and Sophie Maslow had personified the Brontë sisters in 1943.         Ms. Dudley's 1938 signature piece, ''Harmonica Breakdown,'' was in a different vein. Graham often commented on political and social issues, including the Depression and the Spanish Civil War. Ms. Dudley, however, belonged to a more politically radical wing of modern dance.         She was a founder in l942 of the New Dance Group (an outgrowth of the earlier Workers' Dance League), which openly proclaimed the left-wing sympathies of its dancers and choreographers. Many of their dances were topical social-protest pieces. This was also true of many but not all works that Ms. Dudley, Ms. Maslow and William Bales created for a small troupe, the Dudley-Maslow-Bales Trio, from 1942 to 1954.         Early pieces by Ms. Dudley bore titles like ''In the Life of a Worker,'' ''Songs of Protest,'' ''Under the Swastika'' and ''Women of Spain.'' But ''The Lonely Ones'' in 1946 was based on the cartoons of William Steig.         When Ms. Dudley set ''Harmonica Breakdown'' to the music of Sonny Terry on the harmonica and Brownie McGhee on the washboard in 1938, it was seen originally as a solo of despair in the Dust Bowl era. She later described the repeated shuffle she performed in this solo as ''the effort that just living might seem to mean to black people.'' Revived in recent years to the acclaim of modern-dance troupes in the United States and Europe, the solo now appears vivid but more universal.         Ms. Dudley was born on April 3, 1912 in New York City, where she attended the Walden School and started dance lessons at 6 with Ruth Doing. She attended the University of North Carolina. She studied dance in New York with Hanya Holm and performed with her company before joining the Graham troupe in 1935.         She remained a member until 1944, but later appeared as a guest artist with the company. She taught as an assistant to Graham at the Neighborhood Playhouse and at the Graham school from 1938 to 1958. Later her students in London and at the New Dance Group knew her to be a exacting and uncompromising teacher.         Ms. Dudley was divorced from Leo Hurwitz, a filmmaker. She is survived by her son, Tom Hurwitz, of New York, and three grandchildren.       
         Sallie M. Wheeler, an Anheuser-Busch heiress who led a successful campaign to return the nation's oldest and most prestigious horse show to Manhattan, died on Friday at her home in Keswick, Va. She was 70.         Mrs. Wheeler, a lifelong equestrian, led efforts to return the National Horse Show to Madison Square Garden after it moved to the Meadowlands in New Jersey in 1989. With its audience full of black ties and evening gowns, the show had been a highlight of the high society calendar. But, facing financial burdens, it began to lose its luster in the 1980's.         The show, a Manhattan mainstay since 1883, relocated to the Meadowlands amid rumors of impending bankruptcy. In New Jersey, the show increased in size and eliminated its debt but began to lose what Mrs. Wheeler saw as its greatest asset: its prestige.         Mrs. Wheeler believed the National Horse Show was synonymous with its original location, Madison Square Garden. Throughout the show's history, and even during its seven years at the Meadowlands, fans referred to the show as simply the Garden. The horse show is among four events that have been held at the four different Madison Square Garden buildings. Mrs. Wheeler contributed her time and fortune to make sure it went back there.         With much fanfare, the show returned to the Garden in 1996. To herald its homecoming, Mrs. Wheeler arranged for Seventh Avenue to be shut for a parade of Budweiser Clydesdales.         The heyday of the show was over, however. What was once a weeklong event was condensed into four days and eventually into two and a half. And its stature in the New York social scene was only partly restored.         Mrs. Wheeler's love of horses stemmed from her childhood. She was born Sallie Marie Busch on Aug. 22, 1931, in St. Louis to Catherine Milliken Busch and Adolphus Busch III, who became president of Anheuser-Busch in 1934.         Mr. Busch and his brother, August A. Busch Jr., were partners at the brewery and were accomplished horsemen. As a child growing up on Grant's Farm, once the home of Ulysses S. Grant, Sallie rode horses, and when her father died in 1946, August Busch helped rear her. She began to ride competitively, and at 15, she made her first National Horse Show appearance.         Supported by her stake in the family company, Sallie made a living of her love of horses. In 1965, she married Kenneth M. Wheeler, a professional horse trainer. During their more than 35 years of marriage, they raised and trained hundreds of champion horses at their farm in Keswick and participated in equestrian shows around the country.         Among the most prominent and successful exhibitors in the horse world, the Wheelers won thousands of blue ribbons, an average of 200 to 300 each year. In 1987, the American Horse Shows Association named Mrs. Wheeler its horsewoman of the year. In 1999, the organization gave the Wheelers its lifetime achievement award.         Upon receiving that award, Mrs. Wheeler said: ''It is rare that two people have so fully enjoyed a career in a profession and a hobby in a sport such as Kenny and I have been privileged to. We both realize that none of this would be possible without the fabulous animals we do dearly love and appreciate.''         Mrs. Wheeler's first marriage, to Robert Motch, ended with his death.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Wheeler is survived by five children, Sallie M. Motch of Cold Spring, N.Y., Robert Motch of Carthage, Mo., Kenneth M. Wheeler Jr. of Memphis, Gordon L. Wheeler of Harrodsburg, Ky., and Douglas B. Wheeler of Keswick, Va., and nine grandchildren.       
         Germaine Brée, a prolific scholar of French literature who helped introduce a generation of Americans to the work of Camus, Sartre and other modern French writers, died on Sept. 22 at her home in Winston-Salem, N.C., a spokeswoman for Wake Forest University said. Ms. Brée was 93 and had been Kenan professor of humanities at Wake Forest from 1973 until 1984.         During World War II, while serving in the French resistance, Ms. Brée became a friend of Albert Camus. She was the author of numerous studies on the writer, including a critical biography, ''Camus,'' published in 1959. ''Germaine Brée's remarkable study is not likely to be surpassed for many years,'' Henri Peyre wrote in The New York Times Book Review at the time. Ms. Brée was also the author of ''Marcel Proust and Deliverance From Time'' (1955), ''Gide'' (1963) and ''Camus and Sartre: Crisis and Commitment'' (1972). She was a champion of modern French women writers like Monique Wittig, and was the author of ''Women Writers in France'' (1973). Ms. Brée also served as president of the Modern Language Association.         Born in Paris, Ms. Brée spent most of her childhood in the English-speaking Channel Islands. She earned a graduate degree from the University of Paris and taught in Algeria. During World War II, she took a leave from Bryn Mawr, where she was teaching at the time, to fight for the Free French. She joined a volunteer ambulance unit, and was eventually promoted to lieutenant; she was assigned to the intelligence section of the Free French forces in Algiers. Ms. Brée received a Bronze Star and was named to the Legion of Honor for her war service.         After the war, in 1953, Ms. Brée was appointed chairwoman of the French department at New York University's Washington Square College of Arts and Science, only the second woman in the college's history to chair a department.         Ms. Brée is survived by a sister, Murielle Laure Radcliffe, of Wokingham, England.

         Prof. Millie Almy, a psychologist and author who was among the first to advocate special training for teachers in early childhood education, died on Aug. 15 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 86.         Dr. Almy's early research convinced her that play was essential to healthy development and an ideal way for children to start learning the ways of the world around them. Previously, nursery school had been seen as a place to address a tot's safety and grooming, with few toys or challenging activities.         Dr. Almy was widely known for her studies of the mental, emotional and social development of the very young. Starting in the 1950's, she studied how they came to understand subjects like science and literature.         She principally taught at Teachers College of Columbia University and at the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, from which she retired in 1980.         Afterward, she was a Fulbright fellow at Macquarie University in New South Wales, Australia, and a visiting professor at Mills College in Oakland, Calif.         She wrote extensively in journals and books, some of which remain in print as classic textbooks. These include ''Children's Experiences Prior to First Grade and Success in Beginning Reading,'' ''Young Children's Thinking: Studies of Some Aspects of Piaget's Theory'' and, with Celia Genishi, ''Ways of Studying Children: An Observation Manual for Early Childhood Teachers.''         Millie Corinne Almy was born on a farm in Clymer, N.Y., and graduated from Vassar College in 1936. She received a master's in early childhood education and child development in 1945 and a doctorate in curriculum and teaching in 1948, both at Columbia Teachers College.         She started teaching at the University of Cincinnati. She returned to Columbia in 1952 and was a professor of psychology and education until 1971, the year she joined the faculty at Berkeley.         She left no immediate survivors.       
         Berry Berenson Perkins, a photographer and eclectic fashion plate of the 1970's before she settled into marriage with the actor Anthony Perkins, was killed on Tuesday, a passenger on American Airlines Flight 11, which was the first jetliner to strike the World Trade Center, a spokeswoman for the family said. She was 53.         She had been returning to her house in the Hollywood Hills from a family summer home on Cape Cod.         With her sister, Marisa, a widely known model of that era who became an actress, Ms. Perkins captured the attention of fashion editors and society columnists. Her photographs appeared in many magazines, including Glamour and Vogue, whose editor, Diana Vreeland, had known the sisters as girls and nicknamed them Mauretania and Berengaria, after the Cunard ocean liners.         Berinthia Berenson was born in New York, part of a seemingly charmed European family. The daughter of the late Robert L. Berenson, a United States Foreign Service officer, and Gogo Schiaparelli Berenson, Ms. Perkins was a granddaughter of the French couturier Elsa Schiaparelli. On her father's side, she was distantly related to Bernard Berenson, the art critic and collector. Ms. Perkins was educated in Switzerland, France and Italy, traveled widely and was introduced to the famous people in her mother's and grandmother's social world.         She met Mr. Perkins in the early 1970's in New York while he was filming ''Play It As It Lays.'' By happenstance, her apartment was used for a scene in the movie, but she later said she had been in love with the actor since age 12. They were married in 1973, in Wellfleet, Mass., in a ceremony characterized by the informality (the barefoot bride wore a granny dress and carried wildflowers) that seemed to characterize much of their marriage.         In a 1977 interview in The New York Times, conducted while she and Mr. Perkins romped with their young sons, Osgood and Elvis, in their Manhattan home, Ms. Perkins said: ''I'm so delighted with my life. I have this fabulous husband, the man I always wanted to marry. I have two fabulous children, which I always wanted, and we're all so happy.''         Mr. Perkins died in 1992. Ms. Perkins spent the last two years of his life nursing him through AIDS-related illness, which he kept secret because of public paranoia about the disease.         In addition to her sister, of New York, Ms. Perkins is survived by her sons, both of Los Angeles, and her mother, the Marchesa Cacciapuoti di Giugliano, of Paris.         In an interview published in the most recent Fashions of the Times, she characterized herself as something of a peacemaker in a family of strong-willed women.         In recent years, Ms. Perkins spent time in Jamaica, where she ran a beachfront bar with her boyfriend. She also followed the careers of her sons. Osgood is an actor and Elvis an artist. While visiting New York in early July, she told friends she planned to see her sister and mother in Europe and then return to her Cape Cod cottage.       
         Kay Teer Crawford, whose sympathy for high school girls who did not make the cheerleading squad in her Texas hometown led her to start one of the first of the drill teams, died on Aug. 29 at her home in Redondo Beach, Calif. She was 88.         Her son Kim said the reason earlier reports of her death listed her as 83 was that she had lopped five years off her age when she was 75 to increase her employment opportunities. Almost until her death, she actively promoted drill teams not just as entertainment but as a sport.         Mrs. Crawford, a cheerleader herself, came up with the concept of having sequined young women prancing about at sporting events around the time Gussie Nell Davis had the same idea with her Flaming Flashes in Greenville, Tex. Miss Davis went on to form the celebrated Kilgore Rangerettes of Kilgore College in Kilgore, Tex.         A Kilgore College history reports that Miss Davis began the Greenville troupe in 1928, two years before Mrs. Crawford started the Sergeanettes at Edinburg High School in Edinburg, Tex. But Janet Mar, Mrs. Crawford's personal assistant, insists that her boss was first with the inimitable combination of high-spirited marching, dancing and kicking that became an American tradition.         Whatever the chronology, Mrs. Crawford's contribution to the world of drill teams looms large. She brought the idea from Texas to Southern California, where she spent many years adding show-business glamour to plain old Texas strutting. She provided drill teams for 10 Super Bowls, 4 Rose Bowls and 7 Pro Bowls, and at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, she put 1,268 drill team members through their lively paces.         Two years later, at the rededication of the Statue of Liberty, she fielded a team almost that large, including all-stars from every state. The next year, she helped orchestrate a celebration surrounding a mass by Pope John Paul II at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.         David Wolper, who produced the Olympic and Statue of Liberty shows, said: ''Kay recruited, trained and prepared thousands of young drill team girls for the events, and when Kay trained them, they were perfect. We have lost a real champion.''         Kay Waweehie Teer, whose mother was half-Cherokee and half-Comanche, was born on a farm near Granger, Tex., on Aug. 16, 1914. Her father moved off the farm to become the sheriff of Hidalgo County, Tex., where he made his wife and only child deputies so they could travel with him over the vast territory on official business.         He died shortly after moving to Edinburg to take a different law enforcement job. Mrs. Crawford and her mother then squatted in a succession of vacant houses, stealing from gardens to eat. Eventually, they moved in with relatives.         Mrs. Crawford won a coveted cheerleader position, but hated facing the envy and resentment of the 90 girls who did not make it. Inspired by the marching of Reserve Officer Training Corps cadets at a nearby junior college, she asked her principal to start what she at first called a spirit group, something that all the girls could join the next year. Her idea was accepted, and the Sergeanettes took the field in the fall of 1930.         ''All of the women were included,'' Ms. Mar said. ''Nobody got left out.''         Mrs. Crawford then worked her way through what is now Pan American University, where she earned an associate's degree, while cleaning toilets for money and wearing damaged clothing to make ends meet. She earned a bachelor's degree from Baylor University and a master's degree from the University of Texas, writing a thesis titled, ''The Educational Value of Drill Teams in the High School Curriculum.''         She took her drill team idea to El Centro High School in El Centro, Calif., and from there to San Diego High School and Santa Monica High School. She added props, from canes to matador capes, and persuaded a friend in the fabric business to develop nylon pompoms as a more versatile substitute for paper ones.         She then taught physical education and coached drill teams at Santa Monica College, whose president, Richard Moore, said, ''With her batons, hats and costumes, she established college pride, no matter what the prowess of the athletic crew.''         Mrs. Crawford coached cheerleaders for the University of Southern California, the University of California at Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League and the Los Angeles Express of the defunct United States Football League.         She opened a drill team summer camp, started an international competition for drill teams, founded and edited a magazine on the subject of drill teams, and wrote what some consider the definitive textbook on the subject.         Her husband, James H. Crawford, died several years ago after 54 years of marriage. A teetotaler, Mrs. Crawford met him while she was volunteering to greet returning veterans at a bar; he was the one wearing a marine uniform while drinking a glass of milk, their son Kim said.         Mrs. Crawford is survived by Kim, who lives in Dana Point, Calif.; another son, Jay, of Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.; a daughter, Jan Crawford of Torrance, Calif.; nine grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Crawford did not achieve her loftiest ambition. She had been heartily campaigning to make drill team competitions an Olympic sport.       
         Gloria Foster, the distinguished stage actress who portrayed generations of African-American characters in plays like ''In White America'' and ''Having Our Say,'' died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.         The cause was diabetes, said Clarence Williams 3rd, her former husband.         Born in Chicago and reared by her grandmother, Ms. Foster studied at the Goodman Theater School of Drama and made her professional debut in the County Theater at the University of Chicago.         In 1963 she moved to New York and walked into an open audition for Martin B. Duberman's ''In White America,'' a dramatic overview of the black American experience from life aboard 18th-century slave ships to the 20th-century crusade for civil rights.         Soft-spoken and polite and with a Mona Lisa smile, Ms. Foster won her role over dozens of seasoned New York actresses. She soon found herself onstage at the Sheridan Square Theater in Greenwich Village, portraying no fewer than 27 characters.         It was a performance that won her ample attention from New York critics and producers. Writing in The New York Times, Howard Taubman called Ms. Foster ''the most moving of all'' the actors in the play. He later wrote that she ''shook New York'' in that role. In particular he cited her portrayal of the teenage black girl who was the first to integrate Central High in Little Rock, Ark. Life magazine also singled out the scene, and later published a two-page spread on Ms. Foster. She won an Obie Award for that performance, one of three she would receive.         Judith Rutherford James, who produced ''In White America,'' soon cast Ms. Foster again, in 1965, this time as Medea at the Martinique Theater on West 32nd Street, an Off Broadway house that has since vanished. That performance won Ms. Foster another Obie in addition to a Theater World Award, and officially established her as a formidable classical actress.         In later decades, Ms. Foster took on a range of classical roles, including Titania and Hippolyta in ''A Midsummer Night's Dream,'' Andromache in ''The Trojan Women'' and the mother in ''Blood Wedding.'' Many of these productions were produced under the auspices of the New York Shakespeare Festival, whose longtime producer, Joseph Papp, also cast Ms. Foster as modern-day characters, including Miss Molly Hoffenburg in Bill Gunn's ''Forbidden City,'' for which she won a third Obie in 1989.         Perhaps more than awards, however, Ms. Foster's career was notable for the directorial talent that sought her out, including Andrei Serban, who chose her for his Clytemnestra in ''Agamemnon,'' in a 1977 production at the Delacorte Theater in Central Park, and Joseph Chaikin, who cast her as the central character in ''Trespassing,'' in 1982.         Ms. Foster also worked in film and television, playing a supporting role in the movie ''Nothing but a Man'' (1964). Younger hipster audiences were later introduced to Ms. Foster in the 1999 hit ''The Matrix,'' in which she played the Oracle, a mystical seer who sends the movie's hero (played by Keanu Reeves) on his reality-bending mission.         Though familiar Off Broadway, Ms. Foster became famous on Broadway in 1995 as Sadie Delany, the gracious 103-year-old whose story, and that of her more vinegary 101-year-old sister, Bessie, was told in Emily Mann's ''Having Our Say.''         The play, based on the sisters' best-selling memoir, opened at the Booth Theater to near-unanimous good reviews, including stellar notices for Ms. Foster and her co-star, Mary Alice. So seamless were the performances that audience members standing at the stage door often mistook the two actresses for the actual centenarians, offering to help Ms. Foster and Ms. Alice navigate the sidewalk.         In 1999 Ms. Foster made her last appearance, in a revival of ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' alongside Ruben Santiago-Hudson, at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts. Again, as she had throughout her career, Ms. Foster turned her natural reserve into a strength as Lena Younger, the matriarch at the play's center. The mother is the last to leave the stage, a moment that was tailor-made for Ms. Foster's quiet power.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Ruth Goetz, a playwright who collaborated with her husband, Augustus Goetz, on ''The Heiress'' and other plays, died Friday at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. She was 93 and had been living in the Actors' Fund Home in Englewood.         ''The Heiress,'' an adaptation of the Henry James novel ''Washington Square,'' brought the Goetzes great success when it opened on Broadway in 1947. They also wrote the screenplay for the 1949 film version directed by William Wyler. The play was revived in 1995 by Lincoln Center Theater and received Tony Awards for best revival and for Cherry Jones as best actress.         Through her work with the Dramatists Guild and the Young Playwrights Festival, Mrs. Goetz became known as a mentor and encourager of young playwrights. ''Ruth would go anywhere to see a play and was always searching out new writers,'' John Guare said this week. ''She was also a wonderful keeper of the record of our times and knew who was what and when.'' Sinclair Lewis, H. L. Mencken, Dorothy Parker and George S. Kaufman were among her many friends.         She was born in Philadelphia in 1908 and had her first indoctrination into theater from her father, Philip Goodman, a theatrical producer. At the beginning of her career, she was a story editor and costume designer. After she and Mr. Goetz were married in 1931, they began writing plays together. Their first, ''Franklin Street,'' written with Arthur Sheekman and based on Mr. Goodman's autobiography, closed out of town.         Their next, ''One-Man Show,'' which had a brief run on Broadway in 1945, was set in the world of art dealers and was about the relationship between a father and daughter.         Searching for a subject, Mrs. Goetz suggested to her husband that they dramatize ''Washington Square,'' about a domineering father and his painfully shy daughter. After the couple finished the play, a producer persuaded them to contrive a happy ending, in which the daughter, Catherine, reconciles with her faithless suitor. The play, then named ''Washington Square,'' was a failure in Boston.         The Goetzes rewrote it, restoring their original ending. With Jed Harris as the director, the play was recast with Basil Rathbone as the father and Wendy Hiller as the daughter. When ''The Heiress'' opened on Broadway, Brooks Atkinson wrote a harsh review in The New York Times, saying that the James ''story cannot be dramatized.''         ''We hadn't put the novel onstage,'' Mrs. Goetz said years later. ''It was a different story -- the daughter's finding herself through her tragedy.'' Other reviews were favorable, and the play became a Broadway hit, running for 410 performances.         Soon it was an international success both on the stage and on the screen, and, Mrs. Goetz said, ''it gave James, long in his grave, the best seller he never had.'' The movie version starred Ralph Richardson, Olivia de Havilland and Montgomery Clift (as Catherine's suitor). For her performance, Ms. de Havilland won an Academy Award as best actress. The play has been revived frequently, and in 1974 it was transformed into an opera.         The Goetzes followed ''The Heiress'' with their adaptation of ''The Immoralist'' by André Gide, which opened on Broadway in 1954. In his review in The Times, Mr. Atkinson said, ''Magnificently acted by a company led by Geraldine Page and Louis Jourdan, 'The Immoralist' is an admirable piece of work that retains the integrity of Gide and does credit to the taste of the Goetzes.'' In the play, James Dean made his Broadway debut in a small role as a native houseboy.         Together, the Goetzes wrote the screenplay for, among other movies, ''Carrie'' (1952, adapted from Theodore Dreiser's ''Sister Carrie'' and starring Laurence Olivier) and ''Stage Struck'' (1957). ''The Hidden River,'' adapted from a Storm Jamison novel, starring Robert Preston, was their last Broadway collaboration. It, too, was in 1957, the year that Mr. Goetz died.         On her own, Mrs. Goetz wrote ''Sweet Love Remember'd,'' a play about her husband. During the first week of the tryout, the star, Margaret Sullavan, died, and the play closed in New Haven. Mrs. Goetz later adapted ''L'Amour Fou'' by André Roussin into ''Madly in Love.''         She is survived by her daughter, Judy Goetz Sanger, a poet, and a granddaughter, Katie Firth, an actress. Both live in Manhattan.         Speaking about the art of playwriting, Mrs. Goetz said, ''Dramatization is imagination made palpable, or visible, or understandable -- instantly.'' It is, she said, ''the imaginer's highest moment.''       
         Etta Jones, a great and permanently underrated jazz singer who for three decades toured constantly with her musical partner, the saxophonist Houston Person, died on Tuesday at her home in Mount Vernon, N.Y. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, said Joe Fields, the manager of her record label, High Note.         Born in Aiken, S.C., and reared in Harlem, Ms. Jones early on developed wily devices for a small voice.  She used silence, the sound of the breath, a quick yodel here and there, lyric readings that drew out or shut down syllables idiosyncratically, and a sliding pitch that made her an extraordinary blues singer. Billie Holiday was the most obvious and famous precedent for her style, and she was capable of astonishingly close Holiday impersonations, though she rarely let her audiences hear them.         But her hard-edged blues sensibility owed something to Dinah Washington, while her highly improvised phrasing came from horn players like Sonny Stitt. Ms. Jones always cited as an influence Thelma Carpenter, a onetime Count Basie vocalist who became a heavy-vibrato torch singer. Neither a shouter, a whisperer nor a bebopper, Ms. Jones clung fast to a set of jazz standards from the 1940's and 50's, and tunes by composers like Sammy Cahn, her favorite, whose songs are the subject of her 1999 album, ''All the Way.''         With Mr. Person, her musical partner of more than 30 years, Ms. Jones toured the country, still playing often to primarily black audiences, but also by the late 90's appearing twice a year at the Village Vanguard in Manhattan and at international jazz festivals; she was an evergreen presence in the New York jazz world, and kept up her concert schedule until two weeks before her death.         At 15, Ms. Jones sang at the Apollo Theater's amateur night in the summer of 1944, and immediately after her performance she auditioned for and won a job singing with Buddy Johnson, who led a 19-man band. Johnson's group played in a common vernacular jazz style of the 40's -- a mixture of rhythm-and-blues and jump blues -- and, as a second-tier group not as popular as the likes of Basie, Ellington and Eckstine, the band toured black-only clubs and auditoriums throughout the country.         Her job was as a temporary replacement for Ella Johnson, Buddy Johnson's sister, who was on a maternity leave. When Ella Johnson returned to the band, Ms. Jones began working for different groups until the early 1950's, among them the Harlemaires and bands, from medium-size to big, led by Barney Bigard, Pete Johnson, Earl Hines, J. C. Heard and Sonny Stitt.         In 1952 she began eight years of semiretirement, singing intermittently. Finally, in 1960, she was contracted by Prestige Records, and recorded ''Don't Go to Strangers,'' which became a Top 40, million-selling hit, changing her weekly income, as she once put it, from $50 to $750.         By the end of the 1960's, she had developed a trusting partnership with Mr. Person, a big-toned saxophonist. In performance they developed a conversational style of answering each other's lines. ''He knows exactly what I'm going to do,'' she once said. ''He knows if I'm in trouble; he'll give me the note. He leaves me room.'' They were always billed equally, an unusual arrangement for any jazz singer. Starting in 1976, they began recording for Muse, which later changed its name to High Note, and Mr. Person became her manager and record producer through 18 records.         She had three Grammy nominations, for the ''Don't Go to Strangers'' LP in 1960, ''Save Your Love for Me'' in 1981 and ''My Buddy'' in 1999. But she never recorded for a major label; her temperament was decidedly unlike a diva; and outside of the small period of time around ''Don't Go to Strangers,'' she never commanded high concert fees.         Ms. Jones is survived by her husband, John Medlock, of Washington; a granddaughter, Lia Greatheart-Mitchell of Mount Vernon; and sisters Edna Taylor of Akron, Ohio, and Georgia Johnson of Aiken.         Her new and final High Note album appeared in stores on the day she died, ''Etta Jones Sings Lady Day.''       
         Lady Jean Rankin, who held an archaic job as a Woman of the Bedchamber to Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, for more than 40 years, died in Edinburgh on Oct. 3. She was 96.         A kind of lady-in-waiting, a Woman of the Bedchamber attends to a queen's personal tasks, answers the majority of her correspondence and attends less formal functions with her.         The higher-ranking Ladies of the Bedchamber, usually the wives of earls, go to formal events with the queen, taking care of her umbrellas and gloves and so forth, according to Jerrold M. Packard in ''The Queen and Her Court: A Guide to the British Monarchy Today.''         Both groups are called ladies-in-waiting, usually work for two weeks at a time on a rotating basis and are unpaid except for essential expenses. They serve ''because they are personal friends of the queen, or for the honor and kudos the work undoubtedly brings,'' Alan Hamilton wrote in ''The Royal Handbook.''         Lady Jean, who was appointed a Woman of the Bedchamber in 1947, was only five years younger than the Queen Mother and was the last of her ladies-in-waiting to have been almost of the same generation. She accompanied the queen on tours to Paris in 1951, Norway in 1953, the United States and Canada in 1954 and Australia in 1958.         Lady Jean called the Queen Mother ''an easy boss to work for'' and was by her side when she had surgery, as well as when such nasty details as money had to be addressed on shopping expeditions.         The Times of London noted that Lady Jean was a close friend of Princess Margaret, and ''played a pivotal role during her fraught relationship with Group Captain Peter Townsend, acting as a go-between and counselor, especially during the sad period after the princess decided to call off their engagement.''         She continued to serve until 1982, when she became an Extra Woman of the Bedchamber. Until 1994, when she moved to a nursing home in Edinburgh, she continued to serve the Queen Mother from time to time, mainly accompanying her to private dinner parties.         She became something of a celebrity in her own right. The Times wrote: ''She was unflappable, conscientious, but at the same time witty and charming, with a sense of fun to match that of her boss. They suited each other down to the ground.''         Jean Margaret Florence Dalrymple was born in Oxenfoord Castle, Midlothian, on Aug. 15, 1905. Her father, the 12th Earl of Stair, owned a 75,000-acre estate. She spent her youth living in two family castles and in London. She was educated entirely by governesses.         When she was 18, she joined the editorial staff of Queen magazine, a weekly periodical. The Times observed that this was considered ''a fairly racy thing to do.''         The Daily Telegraph reported that in 1931 she met Niall Rankin, a wildlife photographer, and they soon announced that they intended to marry. Lord Stair was unwilling to bless the union because Mr. Rankin had never met his own father, due to his parents' separation. Moreover, he had no money.         So Mr. Rankin finally made the acquaintance of his father, Sir Reginald Rankin. The elder Mr. Rankin was so taken with Miss Dalrymple that he promised to leave his son all his money, The Telegraph said.         They were engaged in July 1931, and Sir Reginald died in September, leaving them a small fortune. The couple married a month later. Mr. Rankin built a reputation as a wildlife photographer and ornithologist and in 1935 received the Wild Life Photography Award of the Year from Hermann Göring.         In 1937, they bought an estate of 1,900 acres on the Isle of Mull. The property came with a 320-acre chain of inhabited islands. They planted rhododendrons and azaleas and bred geese, which Lady Jean continued to raise after Mr. Rankin's death in 1965. The property became a wildlife sanctuary in 1994.         Lady Jean is survived by her son Ian. Another son, Alick, died of cancer in 1999.         During World War II, Lady Jean worked in the Child Recovery Bureau of the Women's Voluntary Service finding homes for orphans, while her husband performed secret missions as a soldier in China. The couple's London home was destroyed by a bomb.         After her appointment in 1947, Lady Jean was in the royal court for three or four two-week periods a year. She spent much of her time farming on the Isle of Mull.         Her legacy was as a footnote to royal events. Elizabeth Longford in ''The Queen Mother'' recorded her remark about the convenience of the Royal Yacht for a traveling queen, as well as telling of the time she and the queen were thrown to the floor of their touring car in Tasmania when the car stopped suddenly.         The New York Times reported in November 1954 that the Queen Mother, whose daughter's coronation had taken place a year earlier, stopped by a day-care center during a visit to New York. She tried to quiet a crying child by offering him some macaroni and cheese.         He was comforted only when Lady Jean picked him up and held him in her arms.       
         Eileen Shanahan, a reporter for The New York Times who broke ground in the male-dominated world of economic news and later a news executive at other papers, died here today. She was 77.         She had been suffering from heart problems and rheumatoid arthritis, her daughter Mary Beth Waits said.         In 1971, The Washington Post reported an incident involving Ms. Shanahan and Maurice Stans, then head of the Department of Commerce, which Ms. Shanahan covered as a leading economic reporter for The Times. Mr. Stans had invited Ms. Shanahan to a reporters' lunch and, when she arrived, she found that the men who worked her beat were not there and that all the other reporters at the lunch were women.         ''Is this a ladies' luncheon?'' The Post quoted her as having asked loudly. Told that it was, she said: ''Then, in that case, I can't stay. I hope you will tell the secretary my reason for leaving. I consider it insulting to lump all women reporters together in a separate class.''         In addition to her work at The Times, from 1962 to 1977, Ms. Shanahan was an assistant managing editor at The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Washington Star, and she was a reporter for The United Press, the Research Institute of America and The Journal of Commerce.         She was a speechwriter for the Treasury Department in the Kennedy administration and assistant secretary for public affairs in the Health, Education and Welfare Department under Jimmy Carter.         Ms. Shanahan left The Times in anger in 1977 after she found that, although she was regarded as one of the leading reporters in the Washington bureau, her salary ranked halfway down the list, according to an account by a Times colleague, Nan Robertson. Every reporter who was paid more was a man.         In her book ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992),  Ms. Robertson described Ms. Shanahan's reaction.         Ms. Shanahan said: ''I had always assumed that I was the victim of a degree of salary discrimination, probably on the unjust rationale that I didn't need the money because I had a husband with a good job.''         ''But in my darkest hour,'' she continued, ''I never imagined that my pay would place me in the lower half of the bureau's reporters.''         During this period, a group of women at The Times filed a discrimination suit against the newspaper. Ms. Shanahan was one of the original plaintiffs, but she had left the paper by the time it was settled in 1978. The Times paid $350,000 to settle the lawsuit and agreed to place significant numbers of women in all levels in every department. Later, efforts were made to equalize men's and women's salaries.         Ms. Shanahan was single-minded on the trail of a story and had a reputation for being sharp-tongued  with officials. ''She yelled at bureaucrats who were uncooperative,'' said Richard E. Mooney, who covered economics with her at The Times. A 1966 profile in Forbes magazine, headlined ''Eileen, the Giant Killer,'' described how she decided to write groundbreaking articles about abuses in the mutual fund industry.         She said that she had gotten the idea after noticing the way mutual fund companies entertained their regulators at a convention of the state commissioners who help to regulate the securities markets.         ''I'm not easily shocked,'' she told Forbes. ''I've been in Washington all my life. I was a Washington correspondent for The Journal of Commerce and a tax information officer for Douglas Dillon before I joined The Times. I've seen lobbyists entertain. I tell you this was shocking. They smelled up the hotel. I said to myself, If they feel they have to entertain the commissioners in this way to protect themselves against regulation, there must be something wrong.''         Ms. Shanahan grew up in Washington and received a bachelor's degree  from George Washington University in 1944. While in college, where she studied political science, she worked one summer as a clerk at The Washington Post. There, she met another George Washington student, John V. Waits Jr., whom she married in 1944. He died in 1995.         In addition to Ms. Waits, of Silver Spring, Md., Ms. Shanahan is survived by another daughter, Kathleen Waits of Tulsa, Okla.; a sister, Dr. Kathleen Shanahan Cohen of Teaneck, N.J.; and three grandchildren.         Mary Beth Waits related a technique her mother suggested she follow. ''If you're going in to a meeting with some man who you think is going to try to intimidate you,'' she had said, ''go in chewing gum. He may think you're crude, but he sure won't think you're intimidated.''       
         Mary Kay Ash, who built a billion-dollar beauty empire from a $5,000 investment in 1963, and who motivated hundreds of thousands of consultants around the world with a combination of rewards, recognition and religion, died yesterday at her home in Dallas. She was 83.         She died of natural causes, said Jim Lawrence, a spokesman for Mary Kay Inc. in Dallas. Mrs. Ash had been in frail health since she suffered a stroke in 1996.         Mrs. Ash, who preferred to be called Mary Kay, was 45 when she started her company, which sells its products through home and office demonstrations by sales representatives. Within two years, the company's wholesale sales had reached almost $1 million.         ''I've been asked a number of times, 'How did you succeed so quickly?' '' she once said. ''The answer is I was middle-aged, had varicose veins and I didn't have time to fool around. Have you heard the definition of a woman's needs? From 14 to 40, she needs good looks, from 40 to 60, she needs personality, and I'm here to tell you that after 60, she needs cash.'' Her company eventually became the largest direct seller of skin-care products in the country.         Last year, the company had sales of $1.2 billion and more than 850,000 sales consultants in 37 countries, ranging from Britain, Australia and Japan to Singapore and Brunei.         Mrs. Ash, who was known as the high priestess of pink, was one of the better known figures in Dallas. She drove a pink Cadillac and, for some years, lived in a $5 million, 30-room pink palace with 28-foot high ceilings, a Grecian pool, crystal chandeliers and 11 bathrooms, one of which duplicated that of her friend, Liberace. The house was sold in 1994, and Mrs. Ash, who was twice widowed and once divorced, returned to the old and less elaborate house where she lived alone. A security guard generally trailed her, even as she pushed her cart in the local supermarket.         Her almost mythical stature in her company was as glittering as her  diamonds. Her unique public popularity engendered such enthusiasm during the company's annual seminar, a three-day multimillion-dollar extravaganza, that she often had to use little-known passageways to elude her fans. More than 35,000 sales representatives and directors and, in some years, professors from the Harvard Business School, paid to attend the education sessions at her seminars in Dallas. The highlight of the seminar was Award Night, in which Mrs. Ash honored those who were the highest achievers for her company. The awards were presented amid a show that would rival those in Las Vegas.         The glitzy seminars were a far cry from the initial company get-together in 1964, held in a warehouse decorated with balloons and crepe paper. Mrs. Ash boned and cooked chicken for 200 people, made the jalapeno dressing and Jell-O salad herself and served it all on paper plates.         As the seminars grew in size and lavishness, the rewards to stellar sales representatives grew in kind. In later years, the annual awards amounted to about $6 million -- dream vacations, jewels, furs and pink Cadillacs (winners received a pink Mercedes in Germany and a pink top-of-the line Toyota in Taiwan). By 1994, 7,000 cars, valued at more than $100 million, had been given to sales representatives.         ''Recognition is the key,'' Mrs. Ash said, explaining her success and how she devised her corporate symbols to reward her sales force. One, labeled Ladder of Success, was a gold pin with each rung marked with a jewel. A ladder covered with diamonds signified a top performer.         Mary Kathyln Wagner was born in Hot Wells, Tex., on May 12, 1918. Her mother, who had trained as a nurse, worked as the manager of a restaurant. At the age of 7, an older brother and sister having already left home, she began cooking and caring for her father, an invalid who had been in a sanatorium with tuberculosis for three years         She was married at 17. Her husband, Ben Rogers, was a radio personality in Houston and a member of a musical group called Hawaiian Strummers. The couple had three children before he left to serve in World War II. On his return, he asked for a divorce and although Mrs. Ash acknowledged that the marriage had been unhappy, the request left her, as she put it, at ''the lowest point of my life.''         With three children to support it did, however, set her off on her career. She worked for 25 years in direct sales, pitching child psychology books at the outset and later conducting demonstrations for Stanley Home Products at parties organized in private homes.         The company that qualified for inclusion in the Fortune 500 list in 1992 opened its doors in September 1963, backed by a $5,000 bank account. Her second husband planned to go into the business with her but died of a heart attack a month before the start of the business. She decided to carry on with her plans, despite the advice of her lawyer and her accountant. The business opened with nine saleswomen and her 20-year-old son, Richard Rogers, a sales representative for Prudential Life Insurance, as financial administrator.         The skin-care products that formed the basis of the company were developed by J. W. Heath, an Arkansas tanner who noticed that his hands looked younger than his face and began experimenting with the solution he used in his work. The formulas were passed on to his daughter, Ova Heath Spoonemore, who, sometime later, acted as the hostess at a Stanley Home Products party where Mrs. Ash was conducting the demonstration. When that part of the get-together was over, Mrs. Spoonemore handed out jars with penciled labels to her guests, all of whom had beautiful skin. She explained to Mrs. Ash that the women were her guinea pigs. Mrs. Ash, who also received some samples, became a fan and in 1963 bought the formulas from the Heath heirs for $500.         The philosophy of the fledgling company was based on three principles enunciated by Mrs. Ash -- treating others as they themselves would like to be treated, putting God first, family second and career third, and the belief that with praise and encouragement, everyone could succeed.         Although the product line was added to over the years -- there are now more than 200 items for women and men in skin, hair, nail and body care and sun protection -- the Mary Kay formula for success changed little. Consultants remained independent, buying products at wholesale and selling at retail, and from the beginning there were no accounts receivable or personal checks accepted. Orders are paid for with cashier's checks, money orders or credit cards, and consultants are encouraged to conduct their own business in the same way.         In addition to her financial policy, Mrs. Ash also decided that there would be no fixed territories. Consultants who line up recruits in other cities and states still receive commissions on the recruits' purchases although the newcomers are trained and guided by the directors in their home territories. The unusual system worked because, as Mrs. Ash put it, ''each sales director thinks 'I'm helping her but someone else is helping my recruits in other cities.' ''         Shares of Mary Kay were listed in 1968, first in the over-the-counter market and eight years later on the New York Stock Exchange. In the early and mid-80's, sales declined and the stock price dropped. In 1985, the company returned to private family ownership through a $450 million leveraged buyout.         Mrs. Ash's third husband, Mel Ash, who was in the wholesale gift business, died in 1980. Her daughter, Marylyn Reed, died in 1991. She is survived by two sons, Richard and Ben, both of Dallas, 16 grandchildren, 28 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.         A friend once told Mrs. Ash, ''Mary Kay Cosmetics was a divine accident looking for a place to happen.'' Her reply summed up her philosophy: ''In 1963, the social forces that now support the financial and legal equality of women had not gained public favor. And yet here was a company that would give women all the opportunities I had never had. I don't think God wanted a world in which a woman would have to work 14 hours a day to support her family, as my mother had done. I believe he used this company as a vehicle to give women a chance.''       
         Edith Schwartz Capa, who helped found the International Center of Photography in Manhattan in 1974, died Wednesday at her Midtown home. She was 88.         She laid the foundations of the center's collections as the wife of Cornell Capa, an international photographer and its founding director emeritus. She organized and maintained the negatives and archives of Mr. Capa and his brother, Robert Capa, another renowned photographer.         She supported the staff in many ways without holding an official position at the center. She also became a den mother to hundreds of photographers. Like the Capas, she was born in Budapest. She married Mr. Capa in 1940 and for 30 years accompanied him around the world on his assignments for Life magazine and the Magnum photo agency.         She is survived by her husband  and a sister, Miriam Siegel of Lutz, Fla.

In the early and mid-80's, sales declined and the stock price dropped. In 1985, the company returned to private family ownership through a $450 million leveraged buyout.         Mrs. Ash's third husband, Mel Ash, who was in the wholesale gift business, died in 1980. Her daughter, Marylyn Reed, died in 1991. She is survived by two sons, Richard and Ben, both of Dallas; 16 grandchildren; 28 great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild.         A friend once told Mrs. Ash, ''Mary Kay Cosmetics was a divine accident looking for a place to happen.'' Her reply summed up her philosophy: ''In 1963, the social forces that now support the financial and legal equality of women had not gained public favor. And yet here was a company that would give women all the opportunities I had never had. I don't think God wanted a world in which a woman would have to work 14 hours a day to support her family, as my mother had done. I believe he used this company as a vehicle to give women a chance.''       
         Carrie Donovan, a fashion editor who could easily have rested on her laurels and leopard skins but came out of semiretirement to find a new and even more enthusiastic audience as ''the lady from Old Navy,'' died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been ailing for several months, said George O'Brien, a friend, and died at New York Weill Cornell Center.         From the beginning, Ms. Donovan's career had a screwball quality worthy of Hollywood. Though she studied dressmaking at the Parsons School of Design, she could never master a needle and thread. She lacked a similar command of automobiles and typewriters, and as a reporter for The New York Times, then as an editor for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and The New York Times Magazine, she wrote all her copy by hand.         And though she was among the first to applaud the designs of Donna Karan and Perry Ellis and brought a virtually unknown Elsa Peretti to the attention of Tiffany, Ms. Donovan was something of an Auntie Mame when it came to managing her own affairs. Money was silk in her fingers, and the rest was often serendipity.         ''She was perfectly cast for a fashion editor,'' said Karl Lagerfeld, the designer. ''She was the leading lady of that role.''         What Ms. Donovan possessed was an eye for talent and a nose for news, a combination that, with her inevitable pearls and outsized black glasses, set her apart from her fashion sisters. She loved the fantastical, which was reflected in her Upper East Side apartment -- with its red walls, red furnishings and leopard carpeting -- but in her editorial pages she was adamantly on the side of readers. She may have been French in her leanings, sprinkling her pronouncements with French même choses, but in her translations of fashion's edicts, she was as American as Carrie.         As her mentor Diana Vreeland once told her: ''My dear, you've got the common touch!''         Nowhere did she apply this more surprisingly than in her television ads for Old Navy, which began running in fall 1997. In all, Ms. Donovan appeared in 42 spots, including one that featured her piloting an airplane with a dog named Magic. If Ms. Donovan, the last of a trilogy of great fashion dames that included Mrs. Vreeland and Carmel Snow of Bazaar, reigned in a small world, she now had fans everywhere. Teenagers and grandmothers alike hailed her in the street, sometimes singing an Old Navy jingle.         ''She was tickled pink,'' the director Joel Schumacher, a friend since the 1960's, said of her new visibility. ''It made her a celebrity.''         As a child in Lake Placid, N.Y., where Carolyn Gertrude Amelia Donovan was born on March 22, 1928, she craved fashion, and struggled with home economics. At 10, she sent the actress Jane Wyman sketches for a wardrobe, and received a handwritten reply.         Her first job was in the hat department at Saks under the imperious Tatiana Liberman, whose husband was Alexander Liberman of Vogue. By the time Ms. Donovan graduated from Parsons School of Design in 1950, she had formed friendships with two of the world's leading dressmakers, Norman Norell and Jacques Fath. More would follow.         But Ms. Donovan's outgoing personality masked an ambivalent relationship with her mother, Margaret, and an isolated childhood spent with grandparents. She and her sister, Joan Donovan, saw nothing of their father, who left the family early, and the girls did not live regularly with their mother until 1942, when the independent-minded Margaret was working for a war production factory in Brooklyn. She later received a teaching degree from Columbia University.         All her career, Ms. Donovan, who  is survived by her sister, of Cambridge, Mass., left the impression that she and Margaret were opposites.         In 1955, recognizing her limitations as a designer, Ms. Donovan went to work as a fashion reporter for The Times, where, according to Mr. O'Brien, a former colleague, she felt outgunned by more experienced writers. She persevered, snaring an interview with Mrs. Vreeland in 1963, when she went to Vogue, and Ms. Donovan soon joined the magazine as one of Mrs. Vreeland's acolytes.         At Vogue, Ms. Donovan flourished, filling her pages with the new and the exciting. She wrote about a young Mr. Schumacher when he and some friends opened a shop called Paraphernalia. On another occasion, a former staff member recalled being sent out to the lobby to tell a group of young men waiting for Ms. Donovan not to sit on the floor. They turned out to be Jim Morrison and the Doors.         She inherited Mrs. Vreeland's mannerisms, like the fortissimo ''divine!'' but not her mantle, and when Mrs. Vreeland was fired from Vogue in 1971, Ms. Donovan decamped for Bazaar. By then, Ms. Donovan had switched from wearing chaste Mainbocher to chic Halston, and like her friends, the decorators Chessy Rayner and Mica Ertegun, she had taken to covering her blond bob with a turban.         Like other editors of that era, Ms. Donovan was an instigator as well as a tastemaker. In February 1974, she helped bring Tiffany and Ms. Peretti together. The designer said Ms. Donovan had the idea that contemporary jewelry would bring the white-glove store a new customer. Today, that arrangement is a $250 million business. ''Nobody would do a favor like this now,'' Ms. Peretti said.         Unable to perform similar magic at Bloomingdale's, where she worked briefly as a public relations executive, Ms. Donovan returned to The Times in 1977 as style editor of the magazine. At their first meeting, Edward Klein, then editor of the magazine, recalled that Ms. Donovan produced some colored markers and began sketching out her plans, all in a brisk monologue of ''mmm's'' and exclamation points. Mr. Klein had no idea what she was talking about.         Ms. Donovan was not unaware of her effect, least of all on newspapermen. Armed with tidbits of fashion gossip and ''always fully fragranced,'' as a former protégée, Linda Wells, the editor of Allure, said, Ms. Donovan could turn a routine meeting into a performance. Yet, as her editors knew, her flamboyance was balanced by a pragmatic streak that for 16 years pleased both readers and advertisers.         These were her best years. She introduced readers to Ms. Karan and Paloma Picasso. She documented the opulence of the 1980's and ushered in the next decade by photographing the trendiest clothes on people in their 90's.         Although in many ways Ms. Donovan was simple in her tastes, preferring plain food and the subway, she was also at home in the upper reaches of fashion and society, a friend to Mr. Lagerfeld as well as the philanthropist Bunny Mellon. While this access improved her insight, it occasionally impaired her objectivity.         At the same time, her more dogmatic assertions often betrayed a deeper need to burn her bridges. She and Bill Blass, a frequent escort, fell out in 1993 when Ms. Donovan excluded him from a published list of 50 people who had influenced fashion in modern times.         In 1997, as if to disprove the dictum  that there are no second acts in American life, Ms. Donovan went to work for Old Navy, playing herself to the hilt. The ads, which brought her financial security, drew on her flamboyant image to promote earthly things like cargo pants.         ''She gave us fashion credibility,'' said Dennis Leggett, the creative director at Old Navy, a division of Gap.         In the final months of her life, Ms. Donovan returned to where her career had begun, The Times. She wrote in its magazine about a little-known designer named Marjan Pejoski, whose feathered-swan dress for the singer Bjork had caused a stir at the Academy Awards. She thought Mr. Pejoski had flair.

         Erica Van Acker, whose experience was the basis of a pioneering public television documentary on rape in 1971 and who became an early public spokeswoman for those who had been raped, died on Sept. 11 in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan and Sag Harbor, N.Y.         Details of her life came to light in research for a biographical sketch.         Ms. Van Acker, who was 30 when she was attacked in the hallway of her apartment building, became pregnant and had an abortion. The documentary, ''No Tears for Rachel,'' was made for Channel 13/ WNET and was broadcast nationally on ''Bill Moyers' Journal.'' After the showing of the documentary, she became an advocate. She would visit hospital emergency rooms to work with doctors to sensitize them to the feelings of those who had been raped.         Mr. Moyers said Ms. Van Acker ''took the chance because she really did want the public to know that rape is a crime where the victim is often made to feel guilty of the crime and to encourage others not to let the imposed sense of shame prevent them from talking to the police or the press.''         The documentary appeared not long before the rape law in New York State was changed to ease the requirement for corroborating evidence to prove a rape. Before the change, legal experts had argued that it was nearly impossible to convict someone of rape, because each aspect of the crime had to be corroborated by evidence other than the victim's testimony.         Though she acted as a child and trained in drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, Ms. Van Acker made her career in business. She was involved in training and automation, often working in the early days of office computers to introduce top and middle-level executives to their unwanted desktops. She worked at Ticketron, then at the Off-Track Betting Corporation and at Citibank, before starting her own consulting firm, called VASA, with Gail Soltysik, whom Ms. Van Acker had hired at Citibank.         ''Rape and its aftermath take away any sense of control,'' she said in an article by Erika Duncan about ''No Tears for Rachel'' in 1995. ''But everything that I did afterward was about taking control. Every transition workshop, every seminar I conducted was somehow deeply out of that experience.''         When Ms. Soltysik left the consulting business, she and Ms. Van Acker bought the old train station in Water Mill, on Long Island, and eventually turned it into a restaurant, the Station Bistro. It was known for its food and its all-female staff. Ms. Van Acker planned the menus and did some of the cooking, including soups and her well-known lentil loaf. The restaurant was sold a year and a half ago.         Ms. Van Acker was working as a senior consultant on compensation at Aon Consulting when she died.         Ms. Van Acker was born in Manhattan. Her father was French, her mother English. She moved to England when she was 8. She has no immediate survivors. A memorial service was held Sept. 29 with a reception afterward at her former restaurant, now called Station Road.       
         Frances Elizabeth Holberton, one of the first computer programmers, whose contributions to software over the years ranged from an early data-sorting program to helping develop the business programming language Cobol, died on Dec. 8 at a nursing home in Rockville, Md. She was 84.         The cause was heart disease, diabetes and complications from a stroke that she suffered several years ago, according to her daughter, Priscilla Holberton of Silver Spring, Md.         ''Betty Holberton was a real software pioneer,'' said Donald E. Knuth, a professor emeritus at Stanford University and author of the three-volume ''The Art of Computer Programming,'' the profession's defining treatise.         Mrs. Holberton, a graduate of the University of Pennsylvania, was one of the six young women recruited by the Army to program the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer, which became known by its evocative acronym, Eniac. The Eniac is credited with being the first all-electronic digital computer.         The Eniac's job was to calculate the firing trajectories for artillery shells. The young women programmers were selected for their skills in mathematics. The work they did was ''hard-wired'' programming, laboriously setting switches and cables inside the 30-ton black behemoth of a machine.         Mrs. Holberton, colleagues recall, was particularly adept at figuring out the best path for guiding the complex calculations through the electronic labyrinth of the Eniac. Frequently, these insights came to her overnight.         ''Betty had an amazing logical mind, and she solved more problems in her sleep than other people did awake,'' recalled Jean J. Bartik, another of the Eniac programmers.         The Eniac was demonstrated in February 1946, too late for use in World War II, but it helped open the door to modern computing. The Eniac programming team broke up, but Mrs. Holberton was the one of the six who stayed longest in the field.         After the war, she joined the Eniac designers, John Presper Eckert and John W. Mauchly, in their effort to develop the Univac, an early commercial computer, which was introduced in 1951. While working on the Univac, Mrs. Holberton did some of her most innovative work. She developed a program for sorting and merging large data files, which at the time were stored on reels of magnetic tape. Any such updating of data files was an arduous programming task at the time, and her program vastly simplified that job.         ''That was a huge tour de force,'' said Paul E. Ceruzzi, a computer historian at the Smithsonian Institution.         In 1953, Mrs. Holberton joined the Navy's Applied Math Lab at the David Taylor Model Basin in Maryland as the supervisor of advanced programming, where she worked until 1966. In 1959, she was a crucial member of the committee that developed Cobol, or Common Business Oriented Language. The committee worked for six months on the standards and specifications for a business programming language, which was introduced in 1960.         The committee's work was seen as a temporary solution to the growing problem created by the increasing need for a standard programming language for handling business data at a time when computing was moving into the mainstream of the corporate world. Yet Cobol, updated many times over the years, is still widely used.         Computer scientists often criticize Cobol as a hasty, inelegantly designed programming language. But it gave computing a way to handle and visually describe business data, making it easier to program business problems on computers.         Mrs. Holberton, who joined the National Bureau of Standards in 1966 and worked there for two decades, once echoed those views. In a 1983 interview conducted for the Charles Babbage Institute, a computing history center at the University of Minnesota, Mrs. Holberton conceded some of the criticisms of the language she helped develop. But, she added, ''Cobol, I felt, was very important because of its ability to describe data.''         According to Kathryn Kleiman, a lawyer who is working on a documentary film on the women in the Eniac program and their contribution to the field, Mrs. Holberton consistently worked on trying to make computers easier to program.         ''She took that hard-won knowledge on the Eniac and applied it over the next 40 years, in nearly everything she did in the field,'' Ms. Kleiman said.         In addition the her daughter Priscilla, Mrs. Holberton is survived by her husband, John Vaughn Holberton, and another daughter, Pamela Holberton, both of Rockville.       
         Catherine Voorsanger, an associate curator of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Monday in New York City. She was 51 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of melanoma, said her family.         Ms. Voorsanger worked at the Met since 1983, contributing actively to the increasingly visible field of post-Federal American decorative arts. Her main area of concentration was 19th- and early-20th century American furniture, but she arrived there after studying American 19th-century painting and architecture and, at the Met, conducting extensive research on John LaFarge's stained glass and the American Aesthetic Movement. These subjects seemed to make her unusually well equipped to help shatter the prevailing stereotype of 19th-century American furniture as uniformly dark, heavy and ornate, not only in her curatorial work but also in scholarly writing, lecturing and postgraduate teaching.         A prime example of her work was ''Herter Brothers: Furniture and Interiors for a Gilded Age,'' an exhibition organized in 1994 with Alice Cooney Freilinghuysen of the Met's decorative arts department, and Katherine S. Howe of the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. She also oversaw research, helped select the objects and contributed to the catalogs for ''In Pursuit of Beauty: Americans and the Aesthetic Movement'' (1987) and ''American Paradise: The World of the Hudson River School'' (1988). Her 88-page ''Dictionary of Architects, Artisans, Artists and Manufacturers'' in the ''Aesthetic Movement'' catalog has become a standard reference in the field.         With John K. Howat, former chairman of the department of decorative arts at the Met, Ms. Voorsanger organized last year's ''Art and the Empire City: New York, 1825-1861,'' which traced the beginning of New York's ascendancy as a cultural capital. The exhibition's catalog won the New-York Historical Society's Henry Allen Moe Award for art-historical writing, and was also the first exhibition catalog to make the New York Public Library's annual Books to Remember list of 25 outstanding publications.         At the Met she also coordinated the updating and computerizing of the documentation for the thousands of decorative objects in the Henry R. Luce Center for the Study of American Art, a vast open-storage display that opened in 1989, and organized the 1994 exhibition ''The Decorative Arts of Frank Lloyd Wright in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.''         Ms. Voorsanger was born Catherine Hoover in Oakland, Calif., in 1950. She earned a B.A. in art history from Smith College in 1972, and, later, a master's and a doctorate from the City University of New York. From 1972 to 1979 she worked as assistant curator and then curator at the California Historical Society in San Francisco. During this time she was a protégé of Alfred Frankenstein, a well-known San Francisco art critic.         In 1979 she returned to New York to become a senior researcher for the painting collection of New York City, initiating a site review and conservation inspection of some 300 19th-century works in public buildings throughout the five boroughs.         Ms. Voorsanger is survived by her husband, Bartholomew Voorsanger, an architect who designed the renovation of the Asia Society and the expansion of the Morgan Library; her mother, Beatrice Slater, of San Rafael, Calif.; and her sister, Holly de Montmarin, of Paris.         Correction:  December 29, 2001, Saturday  A obituary on Dec. 14 about Catherine Voorsanger, an associate curator of American decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, omitted several survivors. They are her father, Robert C. Hoover of Piedmont, Calif.; her brother Robert C. Hoover II of Alameda, Calif.; her half-sister, Whitney Hoover of Piedmont, Calif.; and her half-brothers, John S. Hoover of Los Angeles and Samuel S. Slater of Ketchum, Idaho.       
         Faith Hubley, a three-time Academy Award winner whose 50 animated films often combined elements of myth, jazz and a deeply felt humanism, died on Friday in New Haven. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         For more than 45 years Ms. Hubley made a film a year, an achievement that Dan McLaughlin, head of the animation workshop at the University of California at Los Angeles, called unbelievable. Her first 21 films were made in partnership with her husband, John, before his death in 1977. Her newest film, ''Northern Ice, Golden Sun,'' came out of the lab just a few days ago; its premiere is to be tomorrow at U.C.L.A., and it is to be shown Jan. 8 at the Museum of Modern Art as part of a celebration of Ms. Hubley's life.         Exploring what she called mythic landscapes, Ms. Hubley used primitive myths, magic and music and, in three classic films, the recorded voices of her four young children to comment on the world as it was, is and should be. A jazz fan who sometimes played the cello in her films, she used the works of Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Carter and Quincy Jones as background for what has been described as ''filmic poetry.'' Although the visual images of her later films evoke Miró and Klee, Ms. Hubley has described her films as close to cave painting. ''Northern Ice, Golden Sun,'' not quite seven minutes long, paints the deep attachment the Inuit feel toward the earth.         Ms. Hubley once said that the central thread that runs through her impressionistic, dreamlike and often whimsical films is ''human development, with a strong emphasis on the importance of children as people and on the environment people live in.''         When Faith and John Hubley married in 1955 and began making films together, they had only two marriage vows, according to Ms. Hubley. ''One was to eat with the children,'' she said. ''The other was to make one independent film a year.''         The Hubleys kept both promises, and filmmaking became a family affair. They won their first Academy Award in 1959 for ''Moonbird,'' an impressionistic account of young children at play whose unique soundtrack was the recorded voices of their two sons, Mark and Ray. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would not change the name of the category in which they won from ''cartoons'' to ''animated films'' until 1971, but the Hubleys were already expanding cartoons beyond Disney.         Their second Oscar came in 1962, for ''The Hole,'' in which two construction workers debated nuclear destruction. Their third, in 1966, was for the buoyant ''Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature,'' in which the band plays on as more and more people crowd into its automobile.         The Hubleys' work was the subject of a retrospective in 1998 at the Museum of Modern Art.         Until John Hubley's death during heart surgery, Ms. Hubley was considered the lesser partner in their work. When they met, he was already well known. At Disney he had worked as an art director on ''Bambi,'' ''Dumbo,'' ''Pinocchio,'' and ''The Rite of Spring'' episode of ''Fantasia.'' Staunchly pro-union, he had left Disney during a bitter strike in 1941 and then was a founder of United Productions of America, where he helped move animation away from Disney with the creation of ''Mr. Magoo'' and ''Gerald McBoing-Boing.''         Ms. Hubley, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, had bolted from home at the age of 15 without finishing high school. Reticent in interviews about her childhood except to say that her parents had ''made no room for children,'' she created an intimate self-portrait on film in the 25-minute ''My Universe Inside Out'' (1996), which hints at child abuse and her parents' burning down the family house.         At 18, Ms. Hubley went to Hollywood. Because World War II had emptied the studios of young men, she got a job as a messenger at Columbia. She worked her way up to sound-effects editor, music editor and script clerk, and dreamed of being an independent filmmaker.         History gave her a shove in the right direction. Because of John Hubley's political activism, they were blacklisted. Returning to New York, they fed their growing family by working on commercials and educational films. Their first independent film, ''Adventures of an *,'' was finished the year after their marriage, right on schedule.         ''We could have been rich,'' Ms. Hubley recently told a reporter. ''But I told John, 'If you're an artist, you can't be a huckster.' ''         The Hubleys earned an Oscar nomination for ''Windy Day'' in 1968. This time the voices of the children were those of their two daughters, Emily and Georgia. In ''Cockaboody'' (1973), Emily and Georgia played at being grown-up mothers and glancingly mulled the death of their own mother.         When John died, the Hubleys were working on their 21st film, ''The Doonesbury Special.'' Finished by Ms. Hubley, Garry Trudeau and their longtime animator, Bill Littlejohn, the film became their seventh to be nominated for an Oscar.         After her husband's death, Ms. Hubley turned to larger themes and more abstract images. ''Step by Step'' (1979) projects mother love against the impossibility of protecting children in a world of foul water and limited food. ''Seers and Clowns'' (1994), which was animated by Ms. Hubley, both her daughters and Mr. Littlejohn, uses the words of Chief Seattle against metamorphosing images of wisdom and folly.         ''Faith was always timid about doing animation,'' said Mr. Littlejohn, who first worked with Ms. Hubley on the 1962 film ''The Hole.'' ''The strengths of her films were her brilliant designs and her strong ideas. And making one film a year is a standard no one else has approached.''         Ms. Hubley's solo films, usually a combination of her watercolor paintings and cel animation, often dealt in a poetic way with the treatment of women (''Witch Madness,'' 1999) and with pre-Christian myths. ''The Big Bang and Other Creation Myths'' gives no more credence to the scientific explanation of the beginning of the world than it does to half a dozen primitive beliefs.         At the time of her death, Ms. Hubley was a senior critic in the department of art at Yale University. In addition to her four children, she is survived by six grandchildren.         To the end, Ms. Hubley loved being an independent filmmaker. As she told an interviewer a few months ago: ''I am willing to pay the price: total financial anxiety all the time. I don't have any greed illusions. I need to eat, and that's that.''       
         Laurie Johnston, a World War II correspondent, an author and a reporter for The New York Times who was cited for the humanity and wit of her writing, died at her home in Honolulu on Friday. She was 87.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her daughter Elisa W. Johnston said.         Although she spent several months of the year in Hawaii, the island she came to love in the 1940's while covering the war in the Pacific for Reuters, Ms. Johnston was a ''dyed-in-the-wool New Yorker,'' her daughter said. Until just a few weeks ago, she was at the Greenwich Village home she moved into in 1954.         ''She spent her last few days walking around the World Trade Center site,'' Ms. Johnston said, ''and arrived in Honolulu quite frail but wearing an 'I Love New York' T-shirt.''         Ms. Johnston worked as a columnist, reporter and editor for The Times, covering neighborhoods, education and the courts, among other subjects. Columbia University's Graduate School of Journalism awarded her the Meyer Berger Award for distinguished reporting in 1980, citing her ''consistently warm and perceptive glimpses of the little and large dramas of New York.''         Ms. Johnston was born in Fort Collins, Colo., and grew up in Albany, Ore. She studied English and journalism at the University of Oregon, and after graduating worked at several West Coast newspapers.         During World War II, she covered the Pacific from Pearl Harbor and was one of the few women accredited to report on both the Army and the Navy. In 1946 Ms. Johnston joined Newsweek's international news department, where she stayed until joining The Times in 1949. She retired in 1984.         In 1939 she married Richard W. Johnston, who was also a war correspondent and who eventually became the executive editor of Sports Illustrated. In 1953 she wrote ''Elizabeth Enters: The Story of a Queen'' (Scribners), a biography for which Mr. Johnston served as the picture editor. He died in 1981. Ms. Johnston later married Charles C. Woolley, who died in 1986.         In addition to Elisa Johnston, Ms. Johnston is survived by another daughter, Dana Johnston of New York City and Honolulu; a son-in-law, Barry Layne Morrison, and a granddaughter, Katie H. J. Morrison, all of Honolulu       
         Megan Boyd, whose fabled expertise at tying enchantingly delicate fishing flies put her work in museums and the hands of collectors around the world and prompted Queen Elizabeth II to award her the British Empire Medal, died Nov. 15 in Golspie, Scotland. She was 86.         She did not receive her award from the queen, to whom she explained that she had no one to care for her dog that day. The queen said she quite understood, and Prince Charles, an avid user of her flies, later made the presentation at his nearby Scottish fishing lodge in 1971.         The episode reflected Miss Boyd's unpremeditated eccentricity, also suggested by her usual dress: a man's shirt and tie, sweater, wool skirt, tweed sport jacket and heavy army-style boots. But the flies she dressed at a small table in front of a window and under a gas lamp -- she had no electricity until 1985 -- were regarded by connoisseurs as ''the Tiffanies of the 20th century,'' according to The American Fly Fisher magazine.         From tiny strands of hair she made magic: the classic Scottish flies like the Jock Scott, Silver Doctor and Durham Ranger; American favorites like the Green Butt and Woolly Hugger; and the fly named after her, the Megan Boyd, a nifty blue and black number famous for attracting salmon at the height of summer, when the water is low, hot and dead.         ''Her attention to detail was perfection par excellence,'' said Jimmie Ferard, an English fly fisherman who owns more than 2,000 of Miss Boyd's flies. ''She took such trouble with every fly she tied.''         She liked to sell to fishermen she knew, the ones who lived nearby. Her prices never exceeded a dollar.         ''A Megan Boyd fly is a $1,000 fly,'' said Gary Tanner, director of the American Museum of Fly Fishing in Manchester, Vt.         Rosina Megan Boyd, the youngest of three children, is believed to have been born in England on Jan. 29, 1915. In 1918, her father took a job as a riverkeeper, or private game warden, on an estate in Sutherland County in the Scottish Highlands. Another keeper, Bob Trussler, taught her the craft by having her disassemble a finished fly and then reconstruct it on a smaller hook.         She had little formal education but loved to learn everything about the Brora, the river that flowed through the town of the same name where she grew up. During World War II, she held various jobs, including delivering milk and working for the coast guard auxiliary.         At 20, she moved into a small red-and-white cottage perched on a hillside in the village of Kintradwell, and she lived there for 53 years. By personal preference, she had no running water, electricity, telephone or television. She cut her own hair in a style the British call an Eaton crop.         Her studio was a corrugated iron shed with a rusted red tin roof. She spent 14 to 16 hours a day, six or seven days a week, at her workbench, a kidney-shaped dressing table.         But she was dedicated to supplying the fishermen she knew who fished rivers she had learned intimately. Under the mat at her front door was a pad and pencil for the locals to write down their orders.         ''As long as I was tying flies for the fishermen, which I started off doing to earn my daily bread, I kept doing it,'' she said in an interview with The Atlantic Salmon Fly. ''All the other orders had to go to the bottom of the pile.''         She retired in 1985, when she was 70, because of deteriorating eyesight.         ''I knew my eyesight was failing because I was making bigger heads on the flies,'' she said, ''and once you start to do that, it's no use.''         An aide to Prince Charles once showed up and asked that she quickly whip up a masterpiece or two. She declined, saying that was going to a Scottish dance in the village. She loved the traditional dances.         The prince held no grudge. He visited her last year in the nursing home where she had lived in recent years.         She would teach fly-tying to anyone who asked but she said she was unable to find a suitable heir.         ''There is just one man I taught that could tie a decent fly,'' she said. ''He is dead now. The modern ones just want to tie something quick and scrappy and sell it.''         Miss Boyd, who never married and has no survivors, never caught a fish. She never even went fishing.         ''I wouldn't kill a salmon if I got one,'' she said.
