         Sally Ganz, an art collector and benefactor of educational and cultural organizations, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         With her husband, Victor W. Ganz, a vice president and longtime trustee of the Whitney Museum of American Art who died in 1987, Mrs. Ganz accumulated works by Picasso, Jasper Johns, Eva Hesse, Robert Rauschenberg, Frank Stella and other artists whom the couple championed and befriended.         An independent, spirited woman with a husky tobacco voice, Ms. Ganz was recalled by Kirk Varnedoe, the chief curator of paintings and sculpture at the Museum of Modern Art, as ''tough-minded, seriously dedicated to what she believed in.'' It happened that several works she had loaned to the Modern's Johns retrospective, which closed last week, were returned to her just yesterday.         As a founding volunteer of Public Education Association, an advocacy group, Mrs. Ganz helped students in New York City learn to read. Over the years she organized exhibitions to benefit the group, including a Picasso show in 1962 on which she asked John Richardson, who would become Picasso's biographer, to collaborate. She also sponsored minority scholarships at Barnard College and served for years on the board of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. Most recently, she gave money to Helen Keller International to combat river blindness in Africa.         She was born Sally Wile in Louisville, Ky., on Jan. 16, 1912. She studied journalism at the University of Wisconsin, then moved to Manhattan, where she worked at Macy's. In 1935 she met Mr. Ganz, who ran a family costume jewelry business.  They married in 1942.         For years they almost exclusively bought works by Picasso, including, in 1956, his series derived from Delacroix's ''Women of Algiers.'' In the 1960's they branched out to collect works by younger, American artists, becoming frequent lenders to exhibitions and occasional donors, especially to the Whitney. They gave works by Mr. Johns, Mr. Stella and Claes Oldenberg to the museum. Last year Mrs. Ganz also donated a drawing by Tom Levine, a young New York artist.         Mrs. Ganz is survived by a son, Tony, of Los Angeles; three daughters, Victoria DeFelice of Newport Beach, Calif., Kate Ganz Dorment of London and Nancy Wright of La Canada, Calif., and six grandchildren.       
         Alice Huei-Zu Yang, an art historian and curator, died early Saturday morning after a hit-and-run accident at Canal and Varick Streets in Manhattan. She was 35 and lived in TriBeCa.         Ms. Yang's husband, Gerald Szeto, an architect with the firm of Calvin Tsai, was injured in the accident and was in stable condition yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital.         Ms. Yang was born in 1961 in Taipei and came to the United States when she was 15. She studied art history at Yale University, graduating cum laude in 1984. After completing internships in several Manhattan  museums, Ms. Yang worked for five years as an assistant curator at the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, organizing several exhibitions, including a survey of the work of Alfredo Jaar in 1992 and a group show titled ''The Final Frontier'' in 1993. That year, she left the museum to work as a critic and independent curator while earning her master's degree at the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University.         Ms. Yang had recently passed her oral examinations for a Ph.D. at the institute and last week began working as the Robert Lehman curator at the Parrish Art Museum in Southampton, L.I. She was also organizing an exhibition of drawings by emerging Taiwanese artists at the Drawing Center in SoHo.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Yang is survived by her parents, Mr. and Mrs. William Yang, of Taipei, and two brothers, James, of Hong Kong, and Andrew, also of Taipei.       
         Irma Bezold Wilkinson, a benefactor and former staff member of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on April 24 at the Noble Horizons Nursing Home in Salisbury, Conn. She was 91 and had homes in Sharon, Conn., and Manhattan.         Mrs. Wilkinson, an Islamicist and a collector, worked with her husband, Charles, to benefit both the Metropolitan and the Brooklyn Museum of Art. With him and on her own, she made significant contributions to the Islamic and Middle Eastern collections of both museums.         Among her donations to the Metropolitan were ceramic vessels, bronze pins and a goblet, miniature weapons and a stone cup from the ancient Middle East and a lacquer mirror case and ceramics for the Islamic Department. She also donated an album of photographs of archeological digs in the region.         She was born in Germantown, Wis., and graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1929, the year she joined the staff of the Metropolitan. In 1949 she became the museum's registrar and superviser of the Catalogue of Collections, which lists everything in the museum's vast collections.         In 1958 she helped Dorothy H. Dudley, registrar of the Museum of Modern Art, write ''Museum Registration Methods.'' Published by the American Association of Museums, it is circulated worldwide and after two revisions remains a staple in the field.         She resigned from the Metropolitan in 1963 when her husband stepped down as its curator of ancient Middle Eastern art. From then until 1974 he was Hagop Kevorkian Curator of Middle Eastern Art and Archeology at the Brooklyn Museum of Art, where he formed the core of an Islamic collection.         In recent years Mrs. Wilkinson was on the Metropolitan's visiting committees for Middle Eastern, Islamic and Egyptian art. She helped create a lecture series on those subjects that is named in honor of her husband, who died in 1986.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Una E. Johnson, who built the print collection of the Brooklyn Museum of Art into one of the country's largest and best, died April 28 at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Johnson, who was born in Dayton, Iowa, in 1905, was educated at the University of Chicago where she studied art history and literature, and at what is now called Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland.         She worked at the Cleveland Museum of Art before going to the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1936 as assistant curator of prints and drawings under Carl O. Schniewind. In 1941 he retired and she was appointed curator, a position she held until her own retirement in 1969. She was named curator emeritus by the museum in 1973. In 1947 she organized the museum's first annual National Print Exhibition, and she supervised them until 1968.         Ms. Johnson wrote numerous books and catalogues including ''Georges Rouault and His Prints,'' ''20th-Century Master Drawings,'' ''American Prints and Printmakers,'' ''Isabel Bishop, Prints and Drawings: 1925-1964,'' ''Adja Yunkers: 1927-1967,'' ''The American Woodcut: 1670-1950'' and, most important, a monograph about the  French art dealer Ambroise Vollard that catalogued his activities as a publisher of prints and illustrated books. The monograph, originally published by Wittenborn & Schultz in 1944, was republished by the Museum of Modern Art in 1977.         Ms. Johnson also served for three years as director of the Storm King Art Center in Mountainville, N.Y.       
         Elizabeth Tweedy Streibert, associate director of an international exhibition program at the Museum of Modern Art for 19 years, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 57 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, a museum official said.         Ms. Streibert played a major role in negotiating where the museum's shows would tour worldwide, scheduling them in places from Cologne to Mexico City.         She worked at the Modern on and off, beginning in 1966, in positions ranging from curatorial assistant in the department of painting and sculpture to senior exhibition assistant to assistant in the international circulating exhibitions program.         She was a freelance curator and consultant from 1974 to 1977.         From 1972 to 1974, she was a curator for private collections, including those of David Rockefeller, Carter Burden and William A. M. Burden.         She was a curator of Philip Johnson's art collection for a brief period in 1969.         She is survived by her husband, Marshall, and a brother, Thomas Tweedy of Minnesota.       
         Thalassa Cruso, an authority on plants who was known as ''the Julia Child of horticulture'' for her common-sense if often loopy gardening programs on television in the 1960's, died on June 11 at Newton and Wellesley Alzheimer Center in Wellesley, Mass. She was 88 and lived in Marion, Mass.         Ms. Cruso, a witty, acerbic Englishwoman, wrote and starred in the weekly public-television program ''Making Things Grow'' from 1966 to 1969. In brisk, impeccable diction, she indoctrinated viewers into the mysterious world of cyclamen and spathiphyllum, enjoining them to tend their plants with loving kindness, and to throw them in the dustbin without a backward glance if the little ingrates failed to respond.         ''If a plant is unbelievably tatty, dispose of it without the least feeling of guilt,'' she told McCall's in 1971.         Trim and elegant, with dark bangs and a determined chin, Ms. Cruso possessed an uproarious wit, blunt candor and cultivated eccentricity.         ''Ha! There's the little brute,'' she once exclaimed as she flicked an invading slug onto her worktable. Cautioning squeamish viewers to avert their eyes, she raised a flowerpot on high. The pot came crashing down, and the slug was history. WGBH in Boston, which produced the program, was inundated with mail from delighted viewers.         ''Making Things Grow'' was aimed at the novice, and its appeal lay in Ms. Cruso's role as Everygardener, a true amateur who drew her advice from personal experience rather than formal horticultural training. ''I have never studied it, and there is so much I don't know,'' she once said. ''And I'm afraid I'll make some terrible mistake.''         Ms. Cruso did not merely handle plants: she communed with them as if they were sentient creatures, pinching them, patting them, sometimes dumping them unceremoniously onto the counter as dirt flew around the set.         In addition to her broadcasting career, which also included a household-advice program, ''Making Things Work,'' in the early 70's, Ms. Cruso wrote a gardening column for The Boston Globe for 22 years. She was the author of several books, including ''Making Things Grow'' (1969), ''Making Things Grow Outdoors'' (1971) and ''To Everything There Is a Season'' (1973).         She was born Jan. 7, 1909, in London, the daughter of Henry and Mildred Cruso. The name Thalassa, the Greek word for ''sea,'' was a whim of her mother's. According to family legend, a paternal ancestor, John Cruso, was a schoolmate of Daniel Defoe, who would later add an ''e'' to the surname and bestow it on his best-known literary hero. ''My mother's maiden name was Robinson,'' Ms Cruso once said in an interview, ''and I am told that the announcement of that engagement was the last thing that made Queen Victoria smile.''         The Crusos were passionate gardeners, and Thalassa fondly recalled childhood hours spent doing her homework in the greenhouse.         ''When we were given a holiday at school to do a project about our neighborhood, I made a collection of wild plants,'' she said in an interview. ''I bicycled miles to find them. And I found some rare ones.'' She added: ''I didn't win the prize because I presented them sloppily. The girl who won had a collection from her father's garden, neatly pressed. Mine were tied with a boot lace.''         Perhaps craving a way to muck about in the dirt and get paid for it, she went into archeology, receiving her diploma from the London School of Economics in 1931. She served as assistant keeper of the costume collection at the London Museum, and later directed an excavation at Bredon Hill, an Iron Age fort in Worcestershire. There she met the American archeologist Hugh O'Neill Hencken; they married in 1935, and she returned with him to Boston.         Mr. Hencken, who was for many years the curator of European archeology at the Peabody Museum of Harvard University, died in 1981. Ms. Cruso is survived by her daughters, Ala Reid of York Harbor, Me., Sophia Stone of New Orleans and Thalassa Scholl of Boston; seven grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.         As a wife and mother in Boston, Ms. Cruso was hardly satisfied to confine her days to the garden-club circuit. The inspiration for ''Making Things Grow,'' she recalled, came on a visit to her brother in England: ''We would watch the BBC gardening programs and complain about how bad they were. And I had watched and admired Julia Child on TV, and suddenly I thought, 'I could do that with plants.' ''         She began with brief snippets tacked onto the end of longer programs. ''I used to pop on after the baseball game, or the symphony, or a very serious lecture on birth control,'' she said.         Ms. Cruso's work led to frequent appearances on the ''Tonight'' show, where she taught Johnny Carson how to compost eggshells in a closet. As a result of her celebrity, she became an unofficial custodian of the public horticultural trust. ''People stop me on the street,'' Ms. Cruso once said, ''and ask what to do with their African violets.''       
         Evelyn Fortune Bartlett, an art patron who was a major benefactor of the Art Institute of Chicago, died on Tuesday at her home in Beverly, Mass. She was 109.         Alert until a few weeks ago, Mrs. Bartlett was also an ardent gardener and farmer, something of an eccentric and a master of detail. In the lush gardens she cultivated at Bonnet House, a 35-acre estate in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., she could recount how and where every plant, ornament and tile was bought and installed. She grew many varieties of orchids, put black and white swans in the estate's ponds and bought 30 to 40 monkeys for its trees.         Mrs. Bartlett was equally particular with her farm in Essex, Mass., which was called Bothways. Besides the usual cows, sheep and chickens, it was also home to two llamas and an emu. For visitors, she would recite various species she raised. But she would also serve many of them, along with the vegetables she grew, for lunch. Asked if eating the animals bothered her, she replied, ''I run a farm, not a zoo.''         Described as a small, dainty woman with a stern face, she was said to be private but invariably gracious. ''She was completely representative of another age, the age of manners,'' said Courtney Graham Donnell, an associate curator at the Art Institute. ''I had lunch with her three times at her house in Beverly, and we never ate off the same china.'' Before each lunch, there would be sherry by the fire.         Mrs. Bartlett was the daughter of William Fortune, who for many years was president of the Indianapolis Telephone Company as well as other telephone companies and a director of Eli Lilly and Company. Her first marriage was to Eli Lilly, the pharmaceutical concern's founder, from whom she was divorced around 1927.         She married Frederick Clay Bartlett, a Chicago-born artist, architect and patron of the arts, in 1931. Shortly thereafter she took up painting, moving quickly from watercolors to oils and developing her own style. Her pictures -- vividly colored portraits, still lifes and flower paintings, bore little resemblance to her husband's murals, landscapes and figurative works, executed in muted tones.         Mr. Bartlett and his previous wife, Helen Birch, had been among the first Americans to collect Post-Impressionist works, assembling a priceless collection of paintings by Cezanne, Picasso, van Gogh, Matisse and Seurat that went to the Art Institute upon Helen Birch Bartlett's death in 1925.         The collection included Seurat's legendary ''Sunday Afternoon on La Grand Jatte.'' After Mr. Bartlett died in 1956, Evelyn Bartlett donated money to construct a gallery named after him and to provide for the presentation and preservation of those paintings, known as the Helen Birch Bartlett collection.         A later marriage to Daniel Huger ended in divorce in 1969.         Mrs. Bartlett donated many paintings and sculptures to the Art Institute. Although she did not live for very long in Chicago, her interest in the city's art scene continued. When works in the galleries she supported were rehung six years ago, she traveled to Chicago to see them. At her death, she was an honorary governing member, life trustee, sustaining fellow and member of the Old Masters Society of the Art Institute.         No immediate family members survive, a spokesman for the Art Institute said. Mrs. Bartlett bequeathed Bothways, the farm in Essex, to the Massachusetts Trustees of Reservations, a preservation organization, and Whitehall, her home in Beverly, to the Beverly Hospital. Bonnet House was turned into a museum in Fort Lauderdale several years ago, but she retained the right to live there and spent each winter on the estate.         In 1982, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington organized a retrospective exhibition of her work and Mr. Bartlett's that also traveled to the Art Institute. Feted among friends at a gala dinner in the gallery in Chicago, Mrs. Bartlett seemed delighted but made no speech. ''She was,'' Ms. Donnell said, ''much too shy for that.''         Correction:  July 4, 1997, Friday         An obituary of the art patron Evelyn Fortune Bartlett yesterday misidentified her first husband, Eli Lilly. He was the grandson and namesake of the founder of Eli Lilly & Company, not the founder.       
         Joanne A. Moonan, a costume jewelry designer in the 1930's, 40's, 50's and 60's, died last Monday at Southampton Hospital in Southampton, N.Y. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         The cause was lung cancer, her daughter, Wendy Lyon Moonan of Manhattan, said.         Mrs. Moonan was co-founder with her husband, Reginald Lyon Francis Moonan, of Authentics Inc., later known as Van S. Authentics, in the mid-30's. The company made costume jewelry that was sold at the Hattie Carnegie salon in New York and at department and specialty stores around the country. Mrs. Moonan's designs were also frequently featured in fashion magazines. Her husband died in 1980.         During World War II, when metals for jewelry were scarce, Mrs. Moonan used unusual materials like straw, nuts and toy parts. Richard Martin, curator of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, acquired some of these designs for the costume collection at the Fashion Institute of Technology, when he was the curator there.         ''What was interesting is the creativity of materials she used, toy parts and wooden beads, '' Mr. Martin said last week. ''It was very improvised, with a sense of whimsy, like Picasso making a head out of bicycle parts.''         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Moonan is survived by her son, Denis Lyon Moonan of Camden, Me., and a grandson.       
         Janet Annenberg Hooker, whose many philanthropies ranged from the support of musical organizations to the redecoration of The White House and the diplomatic rooms of the State Department in Washington, died Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 93 and had homes in Manhattan, Palm Beach, Fla., and Newport, R.I.         Mrs. Hooker was one of the principal benefactors of the National Museum of Natural History, the largest of the Smithsonian Institution's family of museum buildings on the Mall in Washington. She contributed $5 million for the Janet Annenberg Hooker Hall of Geology, Gems and Minerals, which opened this fall. The $10 million gallery has a walk-through mine, interactive exhibits and high-resolution videos of earthquakes and volcanic action.         A spectacular gem collection housed in the new building includes several other gifts from Mrs. Hooker, among them the Hooker Starburst Diamonds, which she donated  in 1994 in honor of her two sons, Gilbert S. Kahn and Donald P. Kahn. The dazzling set of rare yellow diamonds, cut in a starburst pattern, includes a 245-carat necklace with 50 rectangular diamonds, a 61-carat diamond ring and earrings. Each earring is a 25-carat yellow diamond surrounded by four pear-shaped and 16 baguette white diamonds.         In 1977, Mrs. Hooker also gave the Smithsonian a 75-carat emerald brooch. The half-million-dollar brooch, set with diamonds, was once owned by the Sultan of Turkey, who sported it on his belt buckle. Mrs. Hooker's son, Gilbert S. Kahn, said that his mother's total contribution to the Smithsonian, in cash and jewels, was about $9 million.         When the diplomatic reception rooms of the State Department building were rebuilt in the mid-1980's, Clement Conger, the curator at the time, described Mrs. Hooker as the project's ''staunchest supporter.'' The almost $8 million renovation, paid for with private funds, included the $3.5 million, 47-by-102-foot Benjamin Franklin Dining Room and the Secretary of State's $1.95 million, 10-room suite.         ''Mother was always interested in the decorative arts,'' Mr. Kahn said. He noted that during her winters in Palm Beach, she met and became friendly with a number of ambassadors who were guests at the annual Red Cross Ball, and this heightened  her interest in the effort to enhance the State Department building.         Mrs. Hooker also contributed $250,000 to renovate the Blue Room in the White House and contributed to the fund for the redecoration of the private quarters there. Her interest in the White House Preservation Fund extended through the administrations of six Presidents -- John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon, Gerald R. Ford, Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan.         Mrs. Hooker, her brother, Walter Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to the Court of St. James, and Mr. Annenberg's wife, Lenore, jointly contributed $200,000 in 1987 to the renovation of Blair-Lee House. The gift was for a garden room in a new wing of the government's guest house.         Mrs. Hooker was also an active presence on the social scene in both New York and Florida. One of her principal activities on the charity circuit was the fashionable April in Paris Ball in New York, a benefit affair for French and American organizations. For many years, she not only underwrote the cost of the decorations but also planned and assisted in their placement.         A number of musical institutions also were the recipients of Mrs. Hooker's beneficence. She donated a section of the lobby of the Metropolitan Opera House in Lincoln Center in honor of her mother, Mrs. Moses L. Annenberg, and she contributed over the years to the New York Philharmonic, the Musicians Emergency Fund and to various outdoor concert programs.         Although Mrs. Hooker bought a house in Newport, R.I., in 1992, her health began deteriorating and she never lived in it. ''You finish it and enjoy it,'' she told her son Gilbert. She and her son, however, gave a suite of Louis XV-style furniture to The Elms, one of Newport's famed ''cottages,'' built in 1901 and modeled after the Chateau d' Asineres near Paris. The suite consisted of 12 chairs, a small sofa and a fire screen, covered with 18th-century Beauvais tapestry and framed in gilt carved with trailing garlands and scallop shells. Janet Hooker's name is also on a plaque listing the major donors to the restoration of the house and gardens of the painter Claude Monet in Giverny, France.         Mrs. Hooker was born in Chicago on Oct. 13, 1904, one of seven daughters of Moses Annenberg, the founder of Triangle Publications, and Sadie Annenberg. Three of the publications -- T.V. Guide, The Daily Racing Form and Seventeen Magazine -- were sold to Rupert Murdoch for $3 billion in 1988.         According to a 1990 article in Forbes Magazine, Mrs. Hooker and two of her sisters, Esther Simon and Lita Hazen, both now deceased, were major beneficiaries of the sale. The magazine reported that two sisters, Enid Haupt and Evelyn Hall, had previously cashed in most of their stock. The other two sisters, Pearl (Polly) Levee and Harriette Ames, were deceased. The surviving sisters, and families of the deceased, were also reported to have shared in the proceeds of the sale of General Motors stock valued at $825 million.         Mrs. Hooker was educated at Kemper Hall, an Episcopal school in Kenosha, Wis. An outgoing woman with a determined will and a quiet sense of humor, she tapped into the family tradition of charity as a young bride. Her early grants were primarily in the field of music. Later, her major contributions reflected her interest in the decorative arts.         In 1924 she was married to L. Stanley Kahn, a publisher in the Annenberg communications empire. The couple divorced in 1937 and in the same year Mrs. Hooker, under the name of Janet Kahn, began a brief stage career. She appeared as a school trustee in ''Honor Bright,'' a play produced by Lee Shubert that was mounted in Detroit and Rhode Island but never came to New York. The following year, she married Joseph A. Neff of Lincoln, Neb., who had been in the clothing business in the West and later was involved in the sale of the Cleveland Plain Dealer to S.I. Newhouse. Mr. Neff died in 1969.         Her marriage to James Stewart Hooker took place in 1974. Mr. Hooker was head of labor relations for the Philadelphia Inquirer, an Annenberg newspaper at the time. Her son Gilbert said that the two met at business meetings and that the friendship evolved into a love match. Mr. Hooker died in 1976.         In addition to her two sons, Gilbert Kahn of Newport, R.I., and Miami, and Donald Kahn of Salzburg and London, she is survived by her two sisters, Enid Haupt of New York and Evelyn Hall of Palm Beach; her brother, Walter Annenberg of Philadelphia and Palm Springs, Calif.;  five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 17, 1997, Wednesday  A picture yesterday with an obituary of the philanthropist Janet Annenberg Hooker was published in error. It showed her sister Lita Annenberg Hazen, a patron of medical research and cultural institutions who died in 1995.         Correction:  December 19, 1997, Friday  An obituary of the philanthropist Janet Annenberg Hooker on Tuesday misstated the ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer in 1974, when Ms. Hooker married James Stewart Hooker, an executive there. The paper was owned by the Knight chain, which merged that year to form Knight-Ridder Newspapers Inc.; it was not an Annenberg paper at the time.
