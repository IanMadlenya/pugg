         Betty Bryant, who had such a satisfying childhood career in the backwaters of show business that she never bothered to try to top herself in the Broadway mainstream, died on Jan. 15 at her home in Park Ridge, Ill.         She was 76 and was recalled as the third generation of a family of showboat performers who brought corn  pone and culture to riverside mid-America.         If her life wasn't actually written by Edna Ferber or set to music by Jerome Kern, it was surely because Miss Bryant was only 4 when Ferber's novel ''Show Boat'' came out in 1926, two years before Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d translated it to the Broadway stage.         By then Miss Bryant was an experienced on-board performer, one who had made her acting debut at the age of 6 weeks, stoically (she didn't cry) portraying the slave girl Eliza's baby in the dash across the ice in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.''         If ever an actress was at home in the theater it was she.         The family showboat was both her home and her stage, and for 20 years, until World War II helped bring the showboat era to an end, she spent her springs, summers and falls going from town to town along the Ohio River and its tributaries, sometimes stopping for several weeks in bigger river cities like Pittsburgh or Cincinnati.         During the off-season, with the boat tied up in West Virginia, the family would visit New York or Chicago, sometimes staging variety acts, sometimes just taking in the theatrical sights.         With her mother as her tutor, Miss Bryant managed to get her high school diploma from a cooperating school that monitored her progress.         Based on Miss Bryant's 1994 book ''Here Comes the Showboat'' (University Press of Kentucky), hers was an idyllic life and one she was certainly born to.         To say that show business was in her blood would be something of an understatement. Her grandfather, Sam Bryant, a onetime gardener at Buckingham Palace, had no known theatrical inclinations until he fell in love with a young Gilbert and Sullivan actress named Violet Chapman, who had inclinations enough for both of them.         After the couple married and came to the United States in 1884, it didn't take many years of nagging before Lady Violet, as she preferred to be known, had persuaded her husband to seek thespian adventure, initially, as it turned out, in a horse-drawn traveling medicine show in which Dr. Sam, as he was known, would hawk a cure-all mixture of gasoline and red pepper on the first night in a town, then stage a tent show on the second.         The couple's children, Billy and Florence, were part of the dodge from the beginning and by the time the family graduated to vaudeville a few years later, they had become the Four Bryants.         A chance summer booking on a turn-of-the-century Mississippi River showboat gave them the river bug. Within a few years, Dr. Sam and Captain Billy, as his son was soon known, had acquired first the Princess and then, in 1918, Bryant's New Showboat.         By then, Captain Billy had married the floating troupe's piano and calliope player, Josephine Costello, who gave birth to Betty four years later.         From her start in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' Miss Bryant swiftly advanced to other roles and vaudeville turns, including impressions of George M. Cohan and Eddie Cantor.         As the only member of her generation among the now six Bryants (although Aunt Florence was increasingly an absentee actress), she played boys as often as girls, but regardless of the sex, she soon learned, her forlorn character was sure to die before the final curtain.         That's because the Bryant plays tended to be heavy, heart-rending  melodramas, which never failed to delight their small-town audiences.         Captain Billy did stage an abridged version of ''Hamlet'' once,  but after he got a look at the dazed audience on its way out, he quickly reverted to more familiar fare, replacing it with ''Ten Nights in a Barroom,'' a sure audience pleaser, partly, no doubt, because Miss Bryant died so convincingly.         By the time she graduated to grown-up roles, Miss Bryant had mastered the psychological subtleties of the showboat method of melodrama.         As she wrote in her book, ''A dependable leading lady must be able to run, duck, fall, get up, fall again, crawl over a bed and under a dresser, scream, swing by a rope, deliver an uppercut, struggle and kick and still have enough breath left to say, 'If this is aristocracy, thank God I'm a country girl.' ''         At 20 she married a fellow showboat actor, Jat Herod, a jazz violinist who joined the Army and was soon entertaining troops, as he and his wife continued to do after the war.         She is survived by two daughters, JoAleene Miranda of Des Plaines, Ill., and Mary Perry of Park Ridge, and three grandchildren.         After their divorce in 1962, Miss Bryant, who never tried to win acting jobs in New York or Hollywood, settled in Park Ridge, where she directed amateur theatrical productions and frequently gave lectures on what it was like to grow up on a showboat.       
         Bidu Sayao, a Brazilian soprano whose gossamer voice and vivacious personality made her one of the most popular stars of the Metropolitan Opera from the late 1930's through the 40's, died yesterday at Penobscot Bay Medical Center in Rockport, Me. She was 94 and lived in Lincolnville, Me.         The diminutive Miss Sayao, restricted by her small voice to the lyric and coloratura repertory, often expressed regret that she could not sing such heavier roles as Tosca and Butterfly. But her interpretations of Manon, Violetta in ''La Traviata,'' Mimi in ''La Boheme'' and Susanna in ''Le Nozze di Figaro,'' among other roles, received consistent praise, with critics stressing her expressiveness, sensibility, girlishness and excellence of phrasing.         Balduina de Oliveira Sayao was born on May 11, 1902, into a wealthy family in Rio de Janeiro. Although her childhood dramatizations in front of a mirror convinced her that she had a future as an actress, the family conviction that it was a metier for loose women dashed that hope. Piano lessons, too, were a decided failure, but when she was 13 a music-loving uncle helped arrange lessons with a celebrated former soprano, Elena Theodorini.         After several years of study and  appearances at the court of Romania, her teacher's native country, Miss Sayao studied recital repertory in France with the tenor Jean de Reszke. An eventual audition in Rome led to an engagement as Rosina in ''Il Barbiere di Siviglia,'' and by her late 20's she had sung at many opera houses in Europe and South America.         In a review of her first performance in the United States, a Town Hall recital on Dec. 30, 1935, Noel Strauss of The New York Times wrote that Miss Sayao's voice ''if light, was one of pronounced sweetness; silky and caressing when used at its best.''         Soon afterward, Arturo Toscanini, who was preparing an all-Debussy program for the Philharmonic Symphony Orchestra -- precursor of the New York Philharmonic -- engaged the young soprano whose years in France had perfected her pronunciation, and gave her one week to learn ''La Demoiselle Elue.'' A short time later the Metropolitan Opera, which had recently lost Lucrezia Bori, a stalwart of French repertory, to retirement, invited Miss Sayao to sing the title role in ''Manon'' in February 1937.         In The Times, Olin Downes wrote of the debut, ''Miss Sayao triumphed as a Manon should, by manners, youth and charm, and secondly by the way in which the voice became the vehicle of dramatic expression.'' The singer never again left the Western Hemisphere. The Met was her base, the San Francisco Opera her alternate headquarters and South America the only foreign territory to hear her in live performance.         A month after her first Met ''Manon,'' Miss Sayao sang the lead role in ''La Traviata.'' Two weeks later she sang her first ''Boheme'' in the house, and Howard Taubman wrote in The Times that she sang with ''freshness and simplicity.''         In all, the soprano sang more than 200 performances of 12 different roles at the Metropolitan. She made several opera and song recordings and gave many recitals. In December 1943 she and the baritone Lawrence Tibbett were soloists with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Artur Rodzinski for the inaugural concert at the City Center of Music and Drama. The United States Government decorated her for her many performances in Army camps and hospitals during World War II.         Miss Sayao resigned from the Metropolitan Opera in April 1952, a month before her 50th birthday. ''I am proud, and I did not want to wait until I was asked to leave,'' she said in an interview in 1987. And in 1957 after a performance of ''La Demoiselle Elue,'' which seemed to bring her career full circle, she abruptly retired, canceling many engagements for subsequent seasons. She told an interviewer years later that it was hard to stop but that being able to smoke again was a pleasure.         The soprano's first marriage, to the Italian impresario Walter Mocchi, who headed the Teatro Colon in Buenos Aires for a time, ended in divorce. She and the baritone Giuseppe Danise were married in 1947, and he gave up his career to manage hers.         After her husband's death in 1963, she divided her time between the Salisbury Hotel in Manhattan and her home in Lincolnville. She was  often seen at vocal events in New York City, a tiny woman in high heels, her reddish hair pulled back in the chignon familiar to several decades of opera fans.         On a Metropolitan Opera broadcast in December 1989, the soprano plaintively gave a personal summation of her career: ''I had something appealing, I don't know what. The sincerity of my singing. I give my heart. I give my soul. I give myself.''         Correction:  March 16, 1999, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary of the Brazilian soprano Bidu Sayao on Saturday misstated her age. She was 96, not 94. The obituary also omitted Ms. Sayao's most celebrated recording. The piece, ''Bachiana Brasileira No. 5,'' is a vocalise -- an aria without words -- transcribed for her by the Brazilian composer Heitor Villa-Lobos.       
         Dr. Hildegard Elizabeth Peplau, a nursing educator who played a major role in developing the theory and practice of psychiatric and mental health nursing, died on March 17 at her home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. She was 89.         Dr. Peplau wrote a seminal text, ''Interpersonal Relations in Nursing: A Conceptual Frame of Reference for Psychodynamic Nursing,''  which was completed in 1948 and published in 1952. It was translated into several languages and left an impact in much of the world.         She introduced the concept of nurse-patient relationship, an interpersonal approach that has since been integrated into nursing education and practice. With this, she was considered a force in elevating nursing to a profession.         Colleagues regarded Dr. Peplau as the ''mother of psychiatric nursing,'' said Dr. Grayce M. Sills, professor emeritus at the Ohio State University College of Nursing and a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing.         Referring to the general acceptance of Dr. Peplau's interpersonal process, Dr. Sills added, ''It has been argued that Dr. Peplau's life and work produced the greatest changes in nursing practice since Florence Nightingale.''         Dr. Peplau's book was also deemed highly unusual at the time because it had been written by a nurse, without a physician as a co-author. Its English version remains in print with a 1991 edition from Springer.         Dr. Peplau was born in Reading, Pa., and witnessed the deadly influenza epidemic of 1918, which defined her understanding of the impact of illness and death on families.         She graduated from Pottstown Hospital School of Nursing in 1931 and from Bennington College in 1942. She served in the Army Nurse Corps as a first lieutenant in World War II and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1947 and a doctorate in education in 1953.         She studied psychology for a certificate from the William Alanson White Institute (1953), and that study inspired her to adapt the interpersonal approach for the nursing profession.         Dr. Peplau directed the graduate program of psychiatric nursing at Columbia Teachers College from 1948 to 1953 and its counterpart at Rutgers University after that. She retired from Rutgers as a professor emeritus in 1974.         She lectured worldwide and wrote articles for many publications. She was also executive director and president of the American Nurses Association, which inducted her into its Hall of Fame last year, and was a board member of the International Council of Nurses, which honored her with its highest award, the Christiane Reimann Prize, in 1997.         Dr. Peplau is survived by a sister, Bertha Reppert, of Mechanicsburg, Pa., and a foster brother, John D. Forster, of Reading.       
         Harriet M. Waddy, one of the two highest-ranking black officers in the Women's Army Corps in World War II and its wartime adviser on racial issues, died on Feb. 21 in Las Vegas, Nev. She was 94.         In April 1943, First Officer Harriet West, as Harriet Waddy was then known, made a radio broadcast on behalf of the Army, urging black women to get into uniform.         She said that joining the segregated military ''and accepting a situation which does not represent an ideal of democracy'' was not ''a retreat from our fight'' but ''our contribution to its realization.''         The 6,500 black women who joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, created in 1942, and the organization that succeeded it a year later, the Women's Army Corps, joined an institution in which segregation was the official policy. Many were used as uniformed domestic servants, assigned to cleaning officers' clubs. Harriet West tried to ease their distress after she was promoted to major and named an aide to the WAC director, Col. Oveta Culp Hobby.         Major West and Maj. Charity Adams, who commanded the only unit of black Wacs sent overseas in World War II, were the only two black women to attain the rank of major in the wartime WAC.         ''Harriet was charming,'' Charity Adams Earley recalled last week from her home in Dayton, Ohio. ''She looked good, and she was well-disciplined, as we were all trained to be.''         Major West's composure must have been sorely tested when she was dispatched to the South to hear the grievances of black Wacs.         Lula Jones Garrett, a reporter for The Philadelphia Afro-American, who accompanied Major West on a trip from Atlanta to Fort McClellan in Anniston, Ala., in 1944, wrote how Major West ''had been insulted by a white conductor whom she had asked to hand her baggage from the train.''         Major West fought racially insulting Army decrees. On a visit to Wacs at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, she recommended that ''all reference to white and colored personnel be completely eliminated'' from official memorandums on information boards. She said that would bring ''less embarrassment to the colored personnel'' and a ''feeling that a forward step has been made toward democracy.''         Service in the wartime military, in her view, would help blacks gain acceptance. She said that military service would give black women a chance to ''show their ability'' and be ''of future benefit to the whole race.''         Harriet M. Hardin was born in Jefferson City, Mo., on June 20, 1904, and brought up by a grandmother after her mother died. A graduate of Kansas State University, she worked during the Depression as an aide to Mary McLeod Bethune, the director of the National Youth Administration's Division of Negro Affairs and later a civilian adviser to the WAC.         She entered the WAC officer candidate school at Fort Des Moines in 1942. She was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1948 and retired from the armed forces in 1952. Then she worked for the Federal Aviation Administration and counseled troubled girls at a Job Corps center in Oregon.         A longtime resident of Eugene, Ore., Mrs. Waddy moved to Las Vegas in 1998 to live with a friend, Barbara Connolly, when her health declined. She was married four times but left no immediate survivors. In the war years, she was married to Dr. Charles West, a physician. She and her fourth husband, Maj. Edward Waddy, were divorced.         Another friend, Marie Marshall of Eugene, recalled how Mrs. Waddy was still bowling and driving a car into her 90's. Mrs. Marshall viewed her as a strong and independent woman who said, ''The Frank Sinatra song 'My Way' was just perfect.''       
         Peggy Cass, a brassy-voiced comedian best known for her portrayal of the pregnant, unwed secretary in ''Auntie Mame,'' died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 and had homes in Manhattan and Westhampton, N.Y.         The cause was heart failure, Eugene Feeney, her husband and only survivor, said.         Born in Boston, Mary Margaret  Cass succumbed to the lure of Broadway and moved to New York at 19 after spending three years in the Cambridge Latin School drama club without winning a single speaking role.         After turns as a stenographer, telephone operator, advertising solicitor and model, she finally convinced a producer that she was an actress. She was cast in a U.S.O. tour of ''The Doughgirls'' and spent seven months in Australia without stepping into costume because the United States Army had by then moved to the Philippines.         Her break came when, as an understudy, she took over for Jan Sterling in Chicago in the national tour of ''Born Yesterday.'' Soon after, the producer George Abbott hired her for the 1949 Broadway musical ''Touch and Go.''         But it was the role of the dimwitted secretary, Agnes Gooch, in the 1956 Broadway show ''Auntie Mame'' with which Ms. Cass was most associated. Her performance earned her a Tony Award for best supporting actress. She was nominated for an Academy Award for her work in the  1958 film version.         By the late 1950's, Ms. Cass's facility for brash repartee landed her regular appearances on the television quiz show ''Keep Talking.'' She also appeared often on ''The Jack Paar Show'' in the late 50's and early 60's.         The possessor of an encyclopedic mind, she could be seen during the 60's as often as seven times a week on the quiz shows ''Match Game,'' ''Password'' and ''To Tell the Truth.''       
         Edith Anderson, an American writer who defied postwar ruin and harsh political realities to resettle in divided Berlin with her German Communist husband and lived just long enough to see her cold war memoir published and praised as a literary event, died on Tuesday at her home in Berlin. She was 83.         Ms. Anderson, whose last name was originally Handelsman, had returned to Berlin on April 7 after two weeks in New York to promote her new book, ''Love in Exile,'' published in March by Steerforth Press of South Royalton, Vt.         The product of decades of reminiscences, journalism and correspondence, the book traces Ms. Anderson's odyssey from a conservative Jewish upbringing in the Bronx, to a stint at the Communist newspaper Daily Worker, to encounters with Richard Wright, Simone de Beauvoir, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym and other literati. She also wrote of her consuming romance with Max Schroeder, a surrealist poet, editor and antifascist whom she married and followed from his wartime exile in New York back to Soviet-controlled East Germany in 1947.         ''Love in Exile'' has been hailed by Grace Paley, Doris Lessing and Vivian Gornick, among other writers, as a sharp and gripping portrait of an ideological and human landscape as foreign to today's Americans as the dark side of the moon. A review in The New York Times Book Review  found the book most affecting when Ms. Anderson recounted her domestic anguish and search for love outside the marriage.         In an early section, she described how she landed her job at The Daily Worker in 1942, when she was 26.         ''Hastening down Broadway to my Marxist analyst who charged only $5 a session because I was unemployed (he too was still young) I bumped into a former college crony named Milton. He hailed me joyously. 'You're just the person I need!' He told me he was cultural editor of The Daily Worker but had just been drafted into the Army and must find a replacement by the weekend.''         She was overwhelmed. She would scrub floors at The Daily Worker. But she had no newspaper experience. She wrote:         '' 'I'll break you in,' he said.         '' 'In three days?         '' 'Less.' ''         She asked herself how she had the nerve to pass herself off as cultural editor. ''My analyst brushed these scruples aside. He was delighted that I had a real challenge to bite into; life, as Marx said, was a struggle and I was no more a fraud than anyone else.''         Still, she was soon dismissed and ended up as one of the women on train crews hired to replace men called to war. Shortly afterward, she met Mr. Schroeder, a craggy and mesmerizing onetime bohemian 17 years her senior. He had escaped from Nazi captivity in Vichy, France, and was editing an anti-fascist publication in New York.         After he returned to Germany in 1946, she followed the next year, via Paris, after almost joining the American Army in a desperate effort to enter restricted Berlin at a time when almost everyone there would have given anything to get out. She was to remain, with only intermittent visits home, for the next 52 years, although her husband died in 1958. They had a daughter, Cordelia, who still lives in Berlin.         In ''Love in Exile,'' Ms. Anderson said that as a widow she considered returning to the United States with her daughter but was deterred by the imagined voice of Max: ''What right have you to deprive her of the Socialism for which so many people died or went into exile? It may be imperfect but something can be made of it.'' The book ends in 1962.         Although clearly enamored of Marxism since youth, Ms. Anderson was not overtly political, said her childhood friend, the writer Helen Yglesias, a classmate at James Monroe High School in the Bronx. ''She was highly sympathetic to Max's idealism and his hope that a just society could be built,'' she said.         But she was a sharp and often corrosive chronicler of the death throes of the German Democratic Republic as Communism collapsed and the Berlin Wall fell in 1989: ''a kaleidoscope rolling downhill,'' as she described it.         In an account of the final days, later included in an anthology, ''Without Force or Lies'' (1990), she wrote of traveling through East Germany in a train compartment with her grandson and watching a young man and woman, strangers, suddenly shed their inhibitions and take up the taboo subject of politics.         The man, agitated, ripped off his tie, warning that East Germans  ''had just about had it,'' she wrote.         '' 'I give it one more year before something busts,' he said.         '' 'Six months,' she replied.''         Her grandson grew alarmed and Ms. Anderson sought to calm him. ''But I felt my own scalp creep, as if some law of nature had had broken, a sheep instead of baaing shouted in a human voice, 'Enough!'         ''The young woman had hit it right on the nose: six months. The unthinkable happened here.''         At the same time, Ms. Anderson also wrote acidly of the former West Germans ''tramping around'' the prostrate east, flooding it with inferior ''Western goods.''         Edith Handelsman grew up on Hoe Avenue in the Bronx and graduated in 1937 from New College, a division of Teachers College at Columbia University. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a brother, John Bernard Handelsman of Hampton Bays, N.Y., a cartoonist at The New Yorker, and a grandson.         Besides her memoir, Ms. Anderson also wrote ''Gelbes Licht'' (''Yellow Light'') in 1956 about her railroad work, and short stories, children's books and radio plays. A play, ''Wo Ist Katalin? (''Where Is Katalin?''), was produced in Weimar in 1977. From 1960 to 1977 she was the Berlin correspondent for The New York National Guardian.         Mr. Handelsman said that on her recent book-promotion visit to New York, his sister seemed confused and forgetful, possibly presaging her fatal stroke.         But Ms. Anderson's literary agent, Malaga Baldi of Manhattan, said any infirmities disappeared at a reading the author gave at the New School for Social Research on March 25.         ''She started to read an excerpt,'' Ms. Baldi said, ''but the people would not let her stop.''       
         Grace Zia Chu, who introduced a generation of Americans to Chinese cuisine though her cooking classes in Manhattan and her landmark book ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' died Thursday at a nursing home in Columbus, Ohio. She was 99.         In an era when most Americans believed that chop suey was a classic Chinese dish, Mrs. Chu led her students and readers, step by step, down the complicated byways of Chinese cooking, which, she explained, differed from region to region and, ideally, relied on raw ingredients that did not come from a can. For home cooks bewildered by the unfamiliar ingredients and techniques involved, Mrs. Chu proved to be an ideal guide. Assuming, correctly, that her readers knew precisely nothing about Chinese cuisine, she wrote clearly and simply, tailoring her recipes to the realities of the American kitchen, even if that meant calling for creamed corn in the recipe for chicken velvet corn soup.         Mrs. Chu was born in Shanghai. She was the eldest of the nine children of Zia Hong-lai, a Christian educator and editor, and Sochen Sze. After graduating from the McTyeire School for Girls in Shanghai in 1918, she won a scholarship to Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass., where she earned a degree in physical education in 1924. After returning to China, she taught at McTyeire and taught physical education at Ginling College in Nanjing, and from 1935 to 1947, she was a vice president of the world Young Women's Christian Association.         In 1928, she married Chu Shih-ming, an army officer and an official in the Nationalist Government who at one time was an interpreter and aide-de-camp to Chiang Kai-shek.  When he was posted as a military attache to the Chinese Embassy in Washington in 1941, Mrs. Chu took on the entertaining duties that transformed her into an ambassador for Chinese food.         Mrs. Chu returned to China after World War II but left in 1950 and took up permanent residence in the United States, becoming a citizen in 1955. By that time she had settled in Manhattan, where she began teaching cooking classes at the China Institute. For the next 30 years, she taught at the institute, the Mandarin House restaurant on West 13th Street and at her apartment on West 111th Street.         Her classes later resulted in two cookbooks, ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking'' (1962) and ''Madame Chu's Chinese Cooking School'' (1975).         In ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' Mrs. Chu patiently guided her readers through unfamiliar territory. She listed and described the basic ingredients of Chinese dishes, and the utensils and techniques used to prepare them. She showed how to use a Chinese cleaver, how to hold chopsticks, how to grow bean sprouts at home and how to order a proper Chinese meal in a restaurant. In a concession to American tastes, Mrs. Chu included recipes for chop suey, chow mein and other Chinese-American hybrids, but then pressed on to offer more authentic fare like string beans in bean curd sauce and lobster with black bean sauce, as well as challenging banquet dishes like shark fins with Chinese cabbage.         ''The book may well be the finest, most lucid volume on Chinese cooking ever written,'' Craig Claiborne wrote in The New York Times in 1962. To a generation of Americans familiar with the distinctions among Sichuan, Hunan and Cantonese cooking styles, ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking'' reads like a period piece, but in the early 1960's it was a badly needed instruction manual. It is telling that in his review of the book, Mr. Claiborne had to explain to readers that a wok was ''a Chinese cooking utensil.''         With Arthur Chu, Mrs. Chu wrote ''Oriental Antiques and Collectibles: a Guide'' (1973), ''Oriental Cloisonne and Other Enamels'' and ''The Collector's Book of Jade'' (1978).         Her husband died in 1965, and Mrs. Chu moved to Columbus in 1986. She is survived by her sister, Ruth Zia, of Columbus; two sons, Samuel, of Columbus and Daniel, of New York City; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         MRS.

         Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild, a patron of Martha Graham and of modern dance in Israel, died on Tuesday at her home in Tel Aviv. She was 84.         The granddaughter of Baron James de Rothschild, the founder of the French branch of the Rothschild banking family, Baroness de Rothschild became a supporter of Graham after seeing performances by her and her company in New York in the early 1940's. She bought the house on East 63d Street in Manhattan that was the company's headquarters for many years and supported the Graham school and its activities.         Baroness de Rothschild began her professional life as a research biologist at a laboratory in Paris. She came to the United States at the start of World War II, studied chemistry and biology at Columbia University and worked in an industrial laboratory.         During the war she worked for the Free French movement in New York and London. She enlisted in the French Army and landed in Normandy after the Allied invasion. She was a liaison between the French and United States forces in Paris, returning to New York at the end of the war.         In her quiet way, Baroness de Rothschild intrigued the Graham dancers, who knew her as Bethsabee, the French version of her first name.         ''For all I know, the tour being my first, wardrobe mistresses are always baronesses,'' Paul Taylor wrote in his autobiography, ''Private Domain.'' ''Bethsabee supervises the laundering and packing of our costumes with quiet efficiency, almost as if born to it, and by looking at her own outfits, you can't tell she's an heiress -- that is, if you don't know that expensive dresses are sometimes the dumpiest.''         Besides supervising the wardrobe, Baroness de Rothschild was involved in a wide range of company activities, including taking a few dance classes with Graham and buying the dancers jewelry one Christmas at a lavish party she gave for the troupe.         Baroness de Rothschild founded the Batsheva de Rothschild Foundation for Arts and Sciences in the early 1950's in New York. The foundation's first project, in 1953, was to sponsor a two-week festival of American modern dance on Broadway. In addition to underwriting Graham tours, the foundation also helped establish the Juilliard Dance Theater, directed by Doris Humphrey, and sponsored a second three-week festival of modern dance on Broadway.         One of the Baroness's greatest contributions to modern dance was the founding of the Graham-based Batsheva Dance Company in 1964 in Tel Aviv. Baroness de Rothschild, who had moved to Israel two years earlier, believed the country needed a professional modern dance company with full-scale sets and costumes and thorough training. She sent several dancers to New York to work with Graham, who agreed to be Batsheva's artistic adviser, and Graham sent dancers to Israel to work with the new company.         Internationally known choreographers like Jerome Robbins and Jose Limon went to work with Batsheva, and the troupe toured extensively in the United States, Europe and Asia. Baroness de Rothschild went on to form a second, more balletically based group, the Bat-Dor Dance Company, in 1967. She withdrew her support from Batsheva in 1974 after the company refused to hire as its director Jeannette Ordman, her protegee and the head of Bat-Dor.         Though she never became an Israeli citizen, she remained immensely loyal to the nation, working as a driver after her car was mobilized during the 1973 war. She supported many Israeli causes through her foundation, giving money to hundreds of emigre scientists and providing housing for new arrivals and loans to the poor in Tel Aviv.         She supported the establishment of the Center for Dance Medicine, the Chamber Music Association, the Chamber Ensemble and the Batsheva Crafts Corporation. She also established the Batsheva Foundation for the Advancement of Science in Israel, an endowed fund of the Israel Academy for Science and Humanities. She was the author of a French book on modern dance, ''La Danse Artistique aux U.S.A.''         Baroness de Rothschild is survived by a brother, Guy, of Paris, and a sister, Jacqueline Piatigorsky of Los Angeles.         She received the Israel Prize in 1989 and was honored in 1997 at a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Bat-Dor Dance Company at the new Tel Aviv House. Those paying tribute included Roni Milo, the Mayor of Tel Aviv, and the choreographers Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor.         Throughout her life the Baroness fascinated people with her innocent grandeur. Graham long remembered an exchange she had with the baroness after they visited the august Rothschild Bank in Paris.         ''It was unlike any bank I had ever seen,'' Graham wrote in her autobiography ''Blood Memory.'' ''No real tellers, no depositors that I could see.         '' 'Bethsabee, where are the depositors?'         '' 'Depositors?'         ''Bethsabee had evidently never been asked that question before.         '' 'We don't really encourage depositors, but yes, we do have one now . . . the Pope.' ''         Correction:  April 23, 1999, Friday  An obituary of Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild yesterday misstated her relationship to Baron James de Rothschild. She was his great-granddaughter, not his granddaughter.       
         Dr. Mary D. Ainsworth, a developmental psychologist whose work revolutionized the understanding of the bond between mothers and infants, died in Charlottesville, Va., on March 21. She was 85.         Dr. Ainsworth's research contributed significantly to attachment theory, which emphasizes the importance of intimate human relationships, or attachments, in shaping children's development.         Dr. Ainsworth, who lived in Charlottesville, worked closely with Dr. John Bowlby, the British child psychiatrist whose work on separation, attachment and loss provided the foundation for attachment theory. She carried on his legacy in the United States, conducting systematic studies of attachments between mothers and infants.         ''No one had ever looked at that'' before Dr. Ainsworth's work, said Jude A. Cassidy, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Maryland at College Park. ''There had been little empirical observation.''         Dr. Ainsworth also developed methods for assessing the quality of the mother-infant bond. Attachment theory holds that infants need a ''secure'' attachment to thrive, and that ''anxious'' attachments can lead to problems later in life. ''She looked at a way of measuring which babies were securely attached and which were not,'' Dr. Cassidy said.         Though much of Dr. Ainsworth's research was for an academic audience, it also had a practical side. She argued, on the basis of her research, that picking up a crying baby does not spoil the child; rather, it reduces crying in the future.         ''That was a huge controversy over that,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''It had been thought that picking up a baby spoiled it and led to more crying. Instead, it teaches the baby that the world is a responsive place and leads to less crying long term.''         Psychologists continue to debate the issue.         Dr. Ainsworth's research also found that feeding an infant on demand rather than on a strict schedule led to a more secure attachment between infant and mother.         ''These findings had a big impact on how pediatricians advised mothers in the second half of the 20th century,'' said Robert S. Marvin, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia.         Mary D. Salter was born in Glendale, Ohio, on Dec. 1, 1913, and spent most of her childhood in Toronto. She received her bachelor's degree in 1935, her master's degree in 1936 and her Ph.D. in 1939, all from the University of Toronto. She then was a lecturer in the university's psychology department until 1942, when she was commissioned in the Canadian Women's Army Corps, attaining the rank of major. She returned to the university as an assistant professor in 1946.         In 1950 she married Leonard Ainsworth, a graduate student in psychology. Shortly after their marriage she moved to London, where she began a lifelong partnership with Dr. Bowlby, who was investigating the impact on institutionalized children of prolonged separation from their mothers in early childhood. Dr. Ainsworth later moved to Kampala, Uganda, where she conducted one of the first studies of mother-infant interaction in the first year of life.         In 1955 she moved to Baltimore, where she joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. She became a full professor there in 1963, a year after she began her study of infant-mother attachment. In the study, she and her researchers conducted four-hour home visits every three weeks for a year with 26 mothers and their infants. It took four years to collect the data and 10 years to analyze it.         ''The depth has never been matched,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''No one has done it as intensively.''         In 1974 Dr. Ainsworth, who was divorced from her husband in 1960, moved to Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, where she was a professor from 1975 to 1984. She retired as professor emeritus in 1984 and remained professionally active until 1992.         She wrote several books and many academic papers, and was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford in 1966 and 1967. She also received several awards from professional organizations. Last year she was awarded the Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology from the American Psychological Foundation.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Sloan of Vancouver, British Columbia.       
         Patricia Zipprodt, the Tony Award-winning costume designer whose career extended from theater to dance to opera to film and television, died on Saturday at her home in  Greenwich Village. Ms. Zipprodt was 74.         The cause was cancer, according to her sister, Constance Zonka of Chicago.         Quite simply, as a headline writer once put it, Ms. Zipprodt had the gift of garb. In her youth she studied art, and then one day at the ballet she discovered her calling. She wanted to make the dresses.         ''I'll design for the ballet,'' she recalled telling herself. ''I'll paint with fabric.''         Years later she described a play as a painting that moves. ''Instead of it holding still and you look at it, you hold still and it scrolls by,'' she said.         Although she realized her early dream of designing costumes for ballet, she also designed for scores of Broadway shows, won Tony Awards for ''Fiddler on the Roof'' (1964), ''Cabaret'' (1966) and ''Sweet Charity'' (1985), along with many other prizes.         Her costumes graced musicals like ''Pippin'' (1972) and ''Chicago'' (1975), Broadway plays like ''Plaza Suite'' (1968), ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' (1983) and ''The Glass Menagerie'' (1983).         Off Broadway, her credits included ''Our Town'' (1959), ''The Balcony'' (1960), ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad'' (1962) and ''The Blacks'' (1962).         She did wardrobes for the Boston Opera, the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera and for American Ballet Theater, the New York City Ballet, the Houston Ballet and Ballet Hispanico.         In Hollywood she left her imprint on ''The Graduate'' (1967). On television she designed costumes for productions like ''The Glass Menagerie'' on ABC in 1973 and ''Alice in Wonderland'' on WNET in 1983.         Analyzing Ms. Zipprodt's talent, the actor Joel Grey, who worked with her in ''Cabaret'' in 1966, said: ''Her hands were all over the work, whether or not it had to do with making a diaper for Father Time or this very tattered but elegant master-of-ceremonies tail coat.''         Ms. Zipprodt's costumes for ''The Blacks'' brought her to the attention of Jerome Robbins, who hired her when he made his debut as a director with ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad.'' He called on her again for his next show, the hit ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' From Robbins, she said, she learned how to use color to help the audience track the main characters.         In 1990 she spent six months researching and designing more than 300 costumes for the 38-member cast of ''Shogun,'' the muscial based on the James Clavell novel about a shipwrecked 17th-century English navigator who is pivotal in a power struggle among five Japanese overlords.         Despite a million-dollar budget, the assignment, Ms. Zipprodt said, was harder than her work on ''Sunday in the Park With George'' (1984), when the challenge was to design costumes that suggested pointillism without actually using dots; or on the 1977 Metropolitan Opera production of ''Tannhauser,'' which called for more than 200 people to appear onstage at one point.         For ''Shogun'' Ms. Zipprodt traveled to Japan, studied the weaving industry in Kyoto that dated back to the world of ''Shogun'' and visited and photographed Kabuki theaters, samurai-movie studios, gardens, castles and textile mills.         In New York she sought out Japanese women to consult on tradition and custom and experimented in a workshop on West 22d Street with ways to duplicate ancient decorative techniques. (The show was fated to run for only 72 performances.)         Ms. Zipprodt was born in Chicago on Feb. 24, 1925. She was the eldest of three daughters of Agnes Irene Turpin and Herbert Edward Zipprodt, an advertising executive. In 1947 she earned a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in Massachusetts.  After graduation, she returned to Chicago and fell in love with Lieut. Col. Robert O'Brien Jr., an Army cavalryman, but declined his proposal because she felt she must go to New York to discover if she had artistic talent.         By the 1950's Ms. Zipprodt was living the bohemian life in New York, where she painted at the Art Students League, studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and waited on tables at Schrafft's until her visit to the ballet altered her life forever.         About seven or eight years ago, after Colonel O'Brien had married, retired and become a widower, he came across a biography of Ms. Zipprodt in a copy of Playbill in Washington. It mentioned that she was an artist in residence at Brandeis University's theater department. The colonel called Brandeis and asked for her phone number, which the university would not give out. So he told the university to call her and pass along a message: ''Bob O'Brien called, and I want to marry her.'' The university did as instructed.         Ms. Zipprodt and the colonel were married on June 5, 1993. She lived in  Upperville, Va., and in New York. Colonel O'Brien died in 1998. Ms. Zipprodt was inducted into the Theatrical Hall of Fame in 1992.         As meticulous as she might be, as committed to researching history, assessing color, collecting swatches, cords and tassels and overseeing the  construction of costumes, Ms. Zipprodt never forgot that her quest for authenticity and beauty was in the service of the hectic and sometimes harrowing institution of show business.         ''Velcro,'' she once said, ''is our favorite word.''       
         Doris R. Schwartz, a nurse who did some of the earliest research on geriatric nursing care and whose findings led to improvements in health care for the elderly, died on Sunday at her home in Gwynedd, Pa.         A former resident of Manhattan, Ms. Schwartz was 84 and had moved to the Foulkeways Continuing Care Community in Gwynedd after a stroke in 1980. She retired that year from Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing, where she was a professor for many years.         Ms. Schwartz's familiarity with the debilities of old age stemmed from her years as an Army nurse in World War II, when she tended to wounded soldiers with similar afflictions. Her work continued even after she began to use a wheelchair.         After moving to the retirement center, she initiated research by the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing into the use of physical restraints on patients in nursing homes and hospitals; her work led to changes in restraint procedures.         Ms. Schwartz wrote an autobiography, ''My Fifty Years in Nursing: Give Us to Go Blithely'' (Springer; 2d ed., 1995), which remains in print.         In the weeks before her death, she had been working on a book about the 55 people who most influenced her career.         Doris Schwartz was born in Brooklyn and graduated from the Central Methodist Hospital School of Nursing there in 1942. She enlisted in the Army Nurse Corps and served in the Pacific and, after the war, at a military rehabilitation center in Battle Creek, Mich., rising to the rank of captain.         She then worked as a public health nurse in the Visiting Nurse Service with babies and new mothers in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn into the 1950's. She became an adviser to the Teaching Nursing Home Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.         She was a member of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Science and co-director of two groundbreaking programs to train geriatric and family nurse practitioners at Cornell University-New York Hospital. There she taught staff members and worked with victims of strokes and dementia.         A Doris Schwartz Chair of Gerontological Nursing was established at the University of Pennsylvania, and a Doris Schwartz Research Award, honoring a nurse for outstanding research in aging, is given by the Hartford Foundation Institute of Geriatric Nursing at New York University.         Ms. Schwartz leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Shulamit Katznelson, who was awarded the 1986 Israel Prize for Life Achievement, her country's highest honor, for bringing Arabs and Jews together through learning each other's languages, died yesterday at her home in the coastal town of Netanya, north of Tel Aviv. She was 80.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         For nearly half a century, Ms. Katznelson taught Hebrew to Arabs and Arabic to Jews at Ulpan Akiva, an independent residential language school she founded in Netanya in 1951. Arabs and Jews often room together at the school to help break down psychological barriers.         ''We are perhaps naive in trying to approach the problems of the region in this way,'' she said recently. ''But we believe that the firm foundations necessary to build and consolidate peace can only come about through person-to-person contacts and the ability of each side to speak the other's language.''         She added that many of the Jews and Arabs who attend the intensive six-week live-in course in a former hotel complex became friends and remained in touch with each other.         The school philosophy includes Ms. Katznelson's conviction that language cannot be separated from culture. Of the five hours of lessons each day in Hebrew, one hour is spent learning about Judaism and Jewish history. Likewise, the course in Arabic includes the study of Islam and Arab history as well as visits to Arab villages.         Ms. Katznelson was born in Geneva in 1919, and her family immigrated to Palestine two years later. Her mother, Bat-Sheva, became a legislator in Israel's Parliament. Her brother, Shmuel Tamir, served as Justice Minister, and an uncle, Zalman Shazar, was Israel's third President.         Ms. Katznelson attended high school and a teacher's college in Jerusalem, then attended a master's program at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.         From the start, the program at Ulpan Akiva taught not only Jewish immigrants, but also Israel's Arab citizens and visitors from around the world.         Nearly 100,000 people from 148 countries have studied at the school in the last five decades, among them ambassadors, Israeli Army officers and Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ulpan Akiva set up two branch offices in the Gaza Strip towns of Gaza City and Khan Yunis.         Ms. Katznelson retired two years ago, and was succeeded at the school by Ephraim Lapid, a former Israeli brigadier general.       
         Jennifer Paterson, the over-the-top co-star of the quirky television cooking show ''Two Fat Ladies,'' died yesterday at a hospital in London, where she lived. She was 71.         Lung cancer had been diagnosed last month after Ms. Paterson fell ill while filming installments of the cooking series with her partner, Clarissa Dickson Wright.         The show, featuring the two unashamedly corpulent and opinionated eccentrics, is a hit in Britain and the United States and has been syndicated in other countries following its debut on the British Broadcasting Corporation in 1996.         Ms. Paterson and Ms. Dickson Wright were unknown to each other until they were brought together by a BBC producer in what was described as a match made in ratings heaven. One fan who apparently contributed to the ratings was Prince Charles, who sent a gift of homemade organic tomato soup and vanilla ice cream to Ms. Paterson after she disclosed her illness last month.         Ms. Paterson and Ms. Dickson Wright offered their viewers cholesterol-soaked dishes that they favored in their own homes. One show, called ''Meat,'' featured meatloaf draped with strips of bacon, lamb stew, fillet of beef and, perhaps as a nod to health fanatics, a pan-fried chicken dish.         ''I blame Americans for this fear of red meat and fat that's spread all over England,'' Ms. Paterson told an interviewer last year while taking a sip of vodka in a restaurant before heading to the sidewalk for a pre-lunch cigarette.         Ms. Dickson Wright agreed, although she credited the success of the show to a backlash against what she called the health police. ''Our show seems to say to Americans that it's O.K. to eat red meat and cook with butter,'' she said in the same article. ''I don't know why they feel they need permission.''         Each episode of ''The Two Fat Ladies'' was recorded at a different location. Every show began with Ms. Paterson astride a motorcycle with her partner squeezed into a sidecar, zooming toward their destination. When they did their ''Meat'' show, for example, they cooked for a girls' lacrosse team in the kitchen of a boarding school.         They each cooked two dishes per show, working in tandem and punctuating their culinary advice with a raucous sense of humor on any subject that took their fancy. They delighted in skewering the pretensions of haute cuisine.         Last year Ms. Paterson said she was in fine shape for her age. ''Lots of meat, drink and cigarettes and not giving in to things,'' she said in an interview.         She was born into an army family and was unconventional even as a child. At 15 she was expelled from convent school for being disruptive; she later became a matron at a girls' boarding school near Reading.         Ms. Paterson went on from there to become a professional chef. She was the cook for the Ugandan legation in London and later provided weekly lunches for celebrities, including Prince Charles. She was a food columnist for The Spectator when she met Ms. Dickson Wright, a former barrister who wrote a column for Decanter magazine and owned a cookbook store in Edinburgh, where she lives.         The pair was characterized by Suzanne Hamlin in a 1998 article in The New York Times as being ''as appealing as someone else's dotty aunts.'' But Ms. Hamlin, in reviewing their cookbook ''Cooking With the Two Fat Ladies'' (Clarkson Potter),  reported that all six of six recipes she tested did not work as described and that eccentricities and farce failed to be compelling in a cookbook that purported to be useful.         Following its instructions, she said, one dish ended up looking as though ''it had barely survived a brush fire'' and a pudding that was touted as thick and creamy turned out ''wan and thin as a sauce.''         ''It is their rapid rise here, of course, that makes this careless effort at a cookbook so regrettable,'' she wrote.         The Food Network began broadcasting the shows in the United States in 1997 and, as Ms. Hamlin noted, ''in the blink of an eye, they developed a cult following among those who have an innate fondness for British eccentrics.'' American Public Television also distributes ''Two Fat Women'' to stations all over the country.         The Food Network is planning a two-hour tribute to Ms. Paterson, who is survived by an uncle and two brothers, on Sunday night at 9.         Ms. Dickson Wright told the BBC that she had last seen Ms. Paterson 10 days ago, although they had spoken each day on the telephone. She had intended to visit her today to drop off a tin of caviar, she said.         ''She didn't see the point of flowers,'' Ms. Dickson Wright said. ''She'd rather have caviar.''       
         Tahia Carioca, the Egyptian belly dancer often called the Marilyn Monroe of the Arab world, died of a heart attack in a Cairo hospital on Monday.  She was 79.         Miss Carioca's parents were mortified when as a teen-ager she took her beauty and talent to a Cairo nightclub to dance for strangers, but it was the beginning of a journey that would make her one of the world's most renowned belly dancers.         Though the hold of fundamentalist Islam on Egyptian society has virtually wiped out public manifestations of her art, she was in the end granted the official approval her parents withheld, as the Egyptian Culture Minister, Farouk Hosni, led her funeral procession.         The stuff of legend, she married 14 different husbands and once slapped King Farouk when he threw an ice cube down her dress. She had roles in more than 300 movies and television shows.         But beyond mere fame, she virtually defined the intricate, pulsating art called raqs sharqi in Arabic nations but known in the West as the belly dance since a promoter at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair dreamed up the name.         Belly dancers cover less territory than Western dancers, concentrating instead on often minute movements, sometimes emphasizing such tiny muscular articulations as a quivering lower lip.         ''You really liked watching her; she would draw you in,'' said Morocco, a New York dancer who was inspired by Miss Carioca and herself became a leading international performer. She recalled the intensity of Miss Carioca's musicality and her grace.         When another great Egyptian belly dancer, Samia Gamal, died in 1994, her funeral was officially ignored,  Morocco said. Her style of dancing was sometimes called coltish or kittenish, in contrast to the strength and dignity of Miss Carioca's approach.  Miss Carioca used her many films to raise the status of Middle Eastern  dance.         ''She got it recognized as part of the Egyptian fine arts landscape through her portrayals of it in movies,'' said Julie Elliot, a belly dancer who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. ''She was a pioneer of modern oriental dance as it is done today.''         Miss Carioca, originally named Abla Mohammed Karim, was born in 1920. She studied dance at Ivanova Belly Dancing School in Cairo before moving to Mohammed Ali Street, Cairo's 1930's and 40's version of Broadway. She took her stage names from the Brazilian sambas she liked to perform.         Miss Carioca became one of the biggest stars at a Cairo nightclub owned by Badia Massabni, a Lebanese woman. The club was an elegant re-creation of a British music hall and was frequented by both British colonial administrators and the local aristocracy. Women as well as men were part of the audience. Dancers wore elegant, bejeweled gowns, sometimes with bare midriffs and sometimes not.         But the nice surroundings did not make belly dancing, something that up until that time had been performed mainly at private weddings and celebrations, publicly respectable.         ''Many men would reject the trade and would never marry a female performer,'' Karin van Nieuwkerk wrote in a 1995 book about Egyptian dancers called ''A Trade Like Any Other'' and published by the University of Texas Press.         The dancer Morocco said, ''Women do not show themselves publicly outside the family and, maybe, somebody they're going to marry.''         Of course, Miss Carioca married many interesting men, among them an American army officer whom she met during World War II, an actor and a prominent playwright.         That none of the matches lasted long may have owed something to her sometimes assertive personality, Morocco said. ''She was sort of a big mouth,'' she said, ''but very sweet.''         Miss Carioca is survived by an adopted daughter, Atiyat Allah.         Her first film was ''Doctor Farahat'' in 1935, directed by Togo Mizrahi. One of her most popular movies was ''Youth of a Woman,'' in which she played a landlady who seduces a naive, young peasant student. It was shown at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival.         ''She was an important part of Egypt's movie history,'' said the film director Gulal Sharqawi.         She gave up dancing in 1963 but as late as the mid-1980's ran her own theater in Cairo, helping to write and choose plays, as well as directing and producing.         She took to wearing the Islamic head scarf before retiring completely from public view 13 years ago.
