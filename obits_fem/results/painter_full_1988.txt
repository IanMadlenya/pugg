Ida Betzak, a painter, died Sunday of a cerebral hemorrhage at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Betzak, who was born in Russia and grew up in Goldsboro, N.C., worked as an accountant for many years before taking up painting full time. A graduate of New York University, she began exhibiting her works in individual and group shows at galleries throughout the United States in the 1960's. Her oil paintings are primarily colorful, abstract works.         She was president of Burr Artists, an artists' collective, and was active in many other organizations, including the National Arts Club and the National Museum of Women in the Arts.         Mrs. Betzak is survived by a sister, Bella Shore of Forest Hills, N.Y., and a brother, Elias Margoles of Atlanta.       
        Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Best known for her insight into the everyday activities of American women, young and old, and for her studies of life as it was lived in and near Union Square from 1930 until the present day, Miss Bishop was the living continuation of a specific and distinctively American idiom.         That idiom, which was pioneered at the turn of this century by Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, George Luks, John Sloan and others, was reportorial in style, anecdotal in tone and shorn of all extraneous or merely complimentary material. It was intended to seize a moment, tell a tale, and give a renewed dignity to people for whom high art in this country had not often had a place. A Perceptive Observer         On the street corner, in the automat, in the subway and on park benches in fine weather, Miss Bishop proved herself a perceptive observer. For young women in the big city who were as yet unmarked by life, she had a particular feeling. But she was alert to the potential both for happiness and for an irrevocable, untold misery that exists at every stage of metropolitan life.         For all the rapid, spontaneous, firsthand qulity of her observation, she knew how to reach back into European Old Master painting for support and encouragement. John H. Baur, former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, once said of her work that ''in some mysterious manner which I do not really understand, her paintings carry forward the great tradition of north European 17th-century figure painting.''         Miss Bishop cherished that connection, and once said that ''you may have true gifts and the ability to make something that is new and surprising, but if your work hasn't any connections and your gift gives out, you haven't any leverage.'' Optimistic Viewpoint         When she first came to New York in the early 1920s, determined to become an artist, Miss Bishop studied at the Art Students League with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Guy Pene du Bois, both of whom had studied with Robert Henri.         From Pene du Bois, and later from her close friend, the painter Reginald Marsh, Miss Bishop learned to sharpen and perfect her sense of a New York subject. But neither age nor familiarity ever eroded her inherently optimistic approach to life. In her late work, it was as apparent as ever she had an unsentimental confidence that one day, somehow, the lot of women in the city would be changed for the better, Miss Bishop was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 3, 1902, the daughter of John Remsen Bishop, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Anna Bartram Bishop. Her father moved his large family from Princeton to the Midwest in hopes of giving them a more comfortable life. The failure of this venture, and the experience of genteel poverty in Detroit, gave her a lifelong sympathy with underprivileged people. Moved to New York in 1918         In 1918 she moved to New York and studied at the New York School of Applied Design for Women. Shortly after leaving the Art Students League in 1924, she began to work in the Union Square area, where she eventually took rank as the unofficial but unquestioned visual historian.         In 1932, she joined the Midtown Gallery in Manhattan, with which she remained closely affiliated for the rest of her life. A member of the National Academy of Design since 1941, she was vice president of the National Institute of Arts and Letters from 1944-46, a Benjamin Franklin Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in London in 1964, a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1971, and the recipient of honorary doctorates at Bates College, Mount Holyoke College and Syracuse University. She also received the gold medal of the National Arts Club in 1968 and 1970, the Outstanding Achievement in the Arts award (presented by President Carter) in 1979, and the gold medal for painting from the National Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters in 1987.         Miss Bishop was married in 1934 to Dr. Harold Wolff, a neurologist. She is survived by a son, Remsen Wolff, and two granddaughters, Sara and Naomi Wolff.

        Suzy Frelinghuysen, a former opera singer and a painter whose work is increasingly recognized by collectors and museums, died of a stroke on Saturday in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 76 years old, and had homes in New York City and Lenox, Mass.         Suzy Frelinghuysen, a former opera singer and a painter whose work is increasingly recognized by collectors and museums, died of a stroke on Saturday in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 76 years old, and had homes in New York City and Lenox, Mass.         An admirer of Juan Gris and Georges Braque, Ms. Frelinghuysen was best known for her paintings and collages of the 1940's, done in a synthetic Cubist style reminiscent of theirs, but with the formal elements manipulated in a highly personal manner. Ms. Frelinghuysen recently sold a work to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Born to a socially prominent New Jersey family in 1912, she was named Estelle Condit Frelinghuysen, but preferred the nickname Suzy, bestowed by her brothers. She attended Miss Fine's School in Princeton, and then studied voice. She married the abstract painter George L. K. Morris in 1935 Under the name of Suzy Morris, she won considerable acclaim for several seasons as a soprano with the City Center Opera, making her debut in ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' in 1947.         Ms. Frelinghuysen, whose husband died in 1975, is survived by a brother, Griswold Frelinghuysen, of Vermont.       
        Jean C. Harris, a professor of art at Mount Holyoke College and the former director of its art museum, died of cancer last Friday at Holyoke (Mass.) Hospital. She was 60 years old, and had been on the Mount Holyoke faculty since 1957.         Jean C. Harris, a professor of art at Mount Holyoke College and the former director of its art museum, died of cancer last Friday at Holyoke (Mass.) Hospital. She was 60 years old, and had been on the Mount Holyoke faculty since 1957.         A specialist in 19th-century French painting, Ms. Harris had published many articles and essays in that field, and had prepared a number of exhibition catalogues, including ''Collegiate Collections,'' a history of art collecting at American colleges and universities.         In 1970 she published a catalogue raisonne of the graphic works of Manet, and in 1984 a handbook of the Mount Holyoke College Art Museum. For the museum in 1962, she organized one of the first shows of work by contemporary American female artists. Examining Art's Economics         At the time of her death she was editing a catalogue of the graphic works of the 19th-century French painter and etcher Alphonse Legros. With a colleague, Sarah Montgomery, a professor of economics at Mount Holyoke, she was also working on a book, ''The Art Complex,'' dealing with the economic organization of the art world.         Ms. Harris was born on Dec. 4, 1927, in Cairo, the daughter of the Rev. Erdman and Harriette Pope Harris. She graduated from Smith College in 1949, and later earned both M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Radcliffe College.         At Mount Holyoke, where she was named a full professor in 1971, she served for a number of years as chairman of the art department, and in the early 1970's oversaw new construction to house it. As director of the college's art museum, from 1978 to 1983, she helped add significantly to its collections, and to the number of exhibitions it organized.         She is survived by her sister, Ruth Pelmas of Glastonbury, Conn., two nieces, a nephew, and an uncle, John Pope, professor emeritus of English at Yale University. A funeral service will be held today at 9 A.M. at Abbey Chapel on the Mount Holyoke campus.       
        Ray Eames, who as a partner in the design firm The Office of Charles and Ray Eames exerted a powerful influence on furniture and industrial design over the last 40 years, died of cancer on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         Ray Eames, who as a partner in the design firm The Office of Charles and Ray Eames exerted a powerful influence on furniture and industrial design over the last 40 years, died of cancer on Sunday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 years old.         As a professional partner of her husband, Charles, who died in 1978, Ray Eames collaborated in the design of hundreds of chairs, tables, and other pieces of furniture that combined mass production with a high sense of style and comfort.         Their most famous work is the ''Eames Chair,'' two pieces of molded plywood connected by stainless steel tubing. Other chairs and tables designed by the Eameses, who worked in Venice, Cal., were made from such materials as reinforced plastic and fiberglas.         Today, their designs are commonly found in airports, high schools and hospitals in mass-produced form, and as showpieces in the most stylish offices and homes. Their Home Was a Showcase         The Eameses' home in Santa Monica, Calif., was designed and built in 1949 as a demonstration project to encourage the use of mass-produced industrial materials. Virtually all of the materials used were bought out of manufacturers' catalogues. The house was a harbinger of the era of prefabricated buildings, but was also widely praised for the lightness, delicacy, intelligence and beauty of its design.         Mrs. Eames, a painter by training, and Mr. Eames, an architect, collaborated in dozens of design projects ranging from films and books to fabric design and museum exhibitions.         Their work in films was especially noted. Most of the films were educational, and many attempted to make scientific notions understandable to a wide public through striking visual means.         The best-known of these efforts is ''Powers of Ten,'' completed by the Eameses in 1968 for the Commission on College Physics. The film illustrates the concept of tenfold magnification by zooming a camera from the surface of the earth to the edge of the universe, then back down to a carbon atom in a man's hand.         A native of Sacramento, Calif., Mrs. Eames was trained as a painter, and studied with Hans Hoffman in New York City for six years in the 1930's. In 1940, she met Mr. Eames, an architect, at the Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. They married and moved to California in 1941.         Mrs. Eames is survived by her daughter, Lucia Demetrios of San Francisco, and by five grandchildren.       
        Nancy Hale, a novelist and short-story writer, died Saturday at the Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Va., after suffering a stroke. She was 80 years old and lived in Charlottesville.         Nancy Hale, a novelist and short-story writer, died Saturday at the Martha Jefferson Hospital in Charlottesville, Va., after suffering a stroke. She was 80 years old and lived in Charlottesville.         Flickers of prim Boston, social New York and proper Virginia danced through her works, the earlier ones focusing on the follies and foibles of well-bred women.         ''I specialize in women,'' Miss Hale said in an interview in 1942, ''because they are so mysterious to me. I feel that I know men quite thoroughly, that I know how, in a given situation, a man is apt to react. But women puzzle me.''         Nancy Hale was born in Boston on May 6, 1908, the daughter of Philip L. Hale and Lilian Westcott Hale, both painters. As a toddler she played in their studios, often setting up a palette and trying to copy whatever they were working on. Brief Career Painting         She graduated from the Winsor School in Boston in 1926, studied at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts and worked briefly as a painter.         Bored with Boston, she moved to New York in 1928. After working as an assistant editor at Vogue (''I pinch-hit as a model''), she joined The New York Times as a reporter. In 1929 she began to contribute ''casuals'' - humorous sketches - and stories to The New Yorker.         She became one of the New Yorker's best-known writers, and once boasted that she sold the magazine more stories in a single year than any other writer. First Novel About the Young         Miss Hale's first novel, ''The Young Die Good,'' was published in 1932. It was based on her idea that young New Yorkers wanted something more than they were getting in life but had neither ''the courage nor strength to go out and get it.'' Her second novel, ''Never Any More,'' appeared in 1934, followed in 1936 by a collection of short stories, ''The Earliest Dreams.''         Among her other works were ''New England Discovery'' (1963), ''Life in the Studio'' (1969), ''Secrets'' (1971), ''Mary Cassatt'' (1975) and ''The Night of the Hurricane'' (1978).         She is survived by her husband, Fredson T. Bowers, of Charlottesville, a former chairman of the English department of the University of Virginia; two sons by previous marriages, William Wertenbaker, of New Haven, Conn., and Mark Hardin; five grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
        Esther Gottlieb, retired dean of girls at the Fashion Industries High School in New York and the widow of Adolph Gottlieb, the Abstract Expressionist painter, died of cerebral meningitis on Monday. She was 81 years old and lived in New York City and East Hampton, L.I.         Esther Gottlieb, retired dean of girls at the Fashion Industries High School in New York and the widow of Adolph Gottlieb, the Abstract Expressionist painter, died of cerebral meningitis on Monday. She was 81 years old and lived in New York City and East Hampton, L.I.         Mrs. Gottlieb was the founder and president of the Adolph and Esther Gottlieb Foundation, set up in 1976 according to provisions in her husband's will to assist older artists in need. The foundation, with assets of some $6 million derived from the sale of Mr. Gottlieb's works, gives 10 grants a year and maintains an emergency assistance program. The foundation will continue, its director, Sanford Hirsch, said.         Mrs. Gottlieb was born in Danbury, Conn., on April 15, 1907. She came to New York in 1924, studied art at Pratt Institute and became a painter, working in the garment industry to support herself. In 1932 she married Mr. Gottlieb, and began teaching tailoring skills at the Cental Needle Trades High School - now Fashion Industries High School. She supported her husband financially, eventually giving up her own painting to work as his studio assistant. She retired in 1960. Mr. Gottlieb died in 1974.         Mrs. Gottlieb is survived by two sisters, Frances Dick and Gladys Sikora, both of New York City, and six nieces and nephews.         A funeral service will be held today at 10:30 A.M. at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Chapel, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.
