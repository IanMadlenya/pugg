         Hsieh Ping-ying, a Chinese feminist author known for her autobiographical work, died on Jan. 5 in San Francisco. She was 93.         Miss Hsieh moved to San Francisco in the mid-1970's from Taiwan, to which she had fled from mainland China in 1949.         Miss Hsieh ''pioneered the literary construction of a soldier image for women -- as imaginative as it may have been -- and thereby influenced this kind of literature in China for decades,'' said Charles A. Laughlin,  professor of modern Chinese literature at Yale University.         Her first book was ''War Diary,''  published in 1928 in Shanghai. Dr. Laughlin recalled that, in writing the book, Miss Hsieh accompanied soldiers of the Chinese Nationalist army in 1926 and 1927, when it was trying to bring warlords in the eastern half of China under control and while she was a ''girl soldier'' with propaganda training.         ''At a time when Chinese women were trying to find new modes of identity in the 20th century after having shed the shackles of traditional Chinese feminine identity, there were many different, alternative identities available to them,'' Dr. Laughlin said, ''and I think she was the first to create this very military one.''         A scholar's daughter, Miss Hsieh was born in a village in Hunan province. Before she was 20, she enrolled in the Wuchang Central Political and Military School. The academy trained young women to be uniformed propagandists attached to the regular military.         After her relatively brief military service Miss Hsieh returned to her village and an arranged marriage. In 1940 her book ''Girl Rebel: The Autobiography of Hsieh Pingying'' was published in the United States.         After her marriage ended, Ms. Hsieh was charged with being a Communist and radical and was imprisoned. After her release she studied Chinese literature and worked as a roving writer, editor and teacher. In 1937, when Japan invaded China, she again became a ''girl soldier,'' accompanying Chinese combat troops to the front. Diary entries about her experiences appeared in newspapers and in another book. After World War II she escaped to Taiwan, where she taught and wrote.         Her second husband, Earl Chia,  died in 1988. The couple became American citizens after moving to San Francisco. She is survived by a daughter, Lily Chia Brissman of Nacogdoches, Tex.; two sons, Luke, of Palos Verdes, Calif., and Wen, of Ambler, Pa., and four grandchildren.       
         Ofra Haza, one of Israel's leading pop singers and songwriters, died yesterday at a hospital in Tel Aviv, where she was admitted 13 days ago. She was 41.         She suffered massive organ failure, The Associated Press reported. A hospital staff member, Dr. Zeev Rortenstein, refused to say why she had been hospitalized or what had caused the organ failure, the report said.         Ms. Haza crossed cultural boundaries with her voice, a tender mezzo-soprano that was equally at home with the finely turned ornaments of Middle Eastern music and the phrasing of Western-style pop. She had club hits in Europe, Asia and the United States, and sang the theme song for the movie ''Prince of Egypt.''         Even as her audience became an international one, Ms. Haza proudly asserted her background as a Yemenite Jew, performing in elaborately beaded and brocaded traditional clothing. She sang in Hebrew, Arabic and English, with a repertory that spanned traditional songs, pop anthems and dance music.         Ms. Haza was born in the poor Hatikva district of Tel Aviv, one of nine children. Her parents had left Yemen in 1949 to escape religious persecution. She learned old Yemenite songs from her parents, while also soaking up Israeli folk songs, the Beatles and Elvis Presley.         Israel's prime minister, Ehud Barak, said she represented the Israeli success story. ''Ofra emerged from the Hatikva slums to reach the peak of Israeli culture,'' he said. ''She has left a mark on us all.''         Ms. Haza began performing in a local theater company, Hatikva, when she was 13. As a teenager, she entered a national singing contest and won; she also appeared in television variety shows and in Israeli movies. She released her first album when she was 18.         After two years in the army, she returned to singing, releasing pop albums that were best-sellers in Israel; in all, she had 16 gold and platinum albums there. One of her early hits, in 1979, was ''The Tart's Song,'' a defiant assertion of a young woman's prerogatives. She won the Israeli equivalent of the Grammy Award for best female singer in 1980, 1981 and 1986, and won second prize in the 1983 Eurovision Song Contest.         But in 1985 she decided to change direction. She returned to songs she had learned from her parents, modernizing them for her album ''50 Gates of Wisdom: Yemenite Songs'' (Shanachie), based on poetry by a 17th-century rabbi. ''I wanted to do an album to make my parents happy,'' she said. Dance-music remixes of the songs ''Galbi'' and ''Im Nin'alu'' became international club hits.         The album was a hit in Europe and Asia, and was released in the United States in 1987. Hip-hop producers discovered it; samples of her voice showed up in the remix of Eric B. and Rakim's ''Paid in Full'' and on Marrs's ''Pump Up the Volume.'' On Feb. 3, 1987, she survived an airplane crash on the Israel-Jordan border, and afterward celebrated the date as a second birthday.         She toured the United States in 1988 as Sire Records released her album ''Shaday,'' which sold a million copies worldwide. Her 1990 album, ''Desert Wind,'' featured songs in English, and her 1992 album, ''Kirya,'' included a guest appearance from Lou Reed. ''Kirya'' was nominated for a Grammy Award in the World Beat category. In 1994 Ms. Haza sang at the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony for Yitzhak Rabin, Shimon Peres and Yasser Arafat.         She married Doron Askhenazi, who survives her, in 1997.         Through the 1990's, Ms. Haza performed on recordings by British and American performers.       
         Margaret E. B. Jones, a retired Army major who served with the only battalion of African-American women to serve overseas in World War II, died on April 11 at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington. She was 89.         Mrs. Jones spent most of her adult life in military service and had lived in Alexandria, Va., since 1980, said her husband, Everett Jones, a retired Army major.         In 1945, Mrs. Jones, then Second Lieutenant Barnes, was one of 31 officers who accompanied more than 700 enlisted members of the Women's Army Corps' 6888th Battalion when they were sent to England. The battalion had been formed after civil rights organizations and black newspapers complained that the military was not using African-American women in meaningful jobs.         When the battalion arrived in Britain, members were told to sort through piles of mail that filled two hangars in the countryside, said Charity Adams Earley, who was the battalion's commanding officer.         Mrs. Earley said that white women serving in Europe were working as drivers for officers or doing other tasks equivalent to their male counterparts, and the women of the 6888th had hoped for the same kinds of duties.         ''They told us that if we were going overseas, we would be given assignments men had,'' she recalled from her home in Dayton, Ohio. ''That was a fairy tale.''         Instead, in the sealed orders they received, which they were not permitted to open until the planes carrying them to Britain were in the air, they learned they would be assigned to the postal unit. But soon, Mrs. Earley said, the women realized how vital their new job was to troop morale in wartime Europe.         The women moved three million pieces of mail in three months, much of it letters sent to soldiers who had been transferred, had died, or been scattered after the D-Day assault in France.         ''To move the mail with them was a really tough job,'' said Judith Bellafaire, curator of the Women in Military Service for America Memorial in Washington. ''They worked in 24-hour shifts and they cleared that mail out and were credited with raising the morale of the troops. They have a lot to be proud of.''         Mrs. Jones was in charge of public relations for the battalion, which broke records for the amount of mail it distributed.         Some of the mail, which had been sitting in storage for months, contained spoiled cakes and cookies, and there was even a package of steaks a mother had sent to her son overseas, Mrs. Earley recalled.         Margaret Ellen Barnes was born on Jan. 7, 1911, in Oberlin, Ohio. Her mother, Margaret Sallee Barnes, was active in community and civil rights groups, and her father, James D. Barnes, worked as a chef. Her mother's parents had been slaves in Kentucky, and she reared her children to value education and to stand up for their rights.         After three years at Howard University, where she later received a bachelor's degree, Margaret Barnes joined the military in 1943, a time when it was racially segregated and there were few places for women. She signed up for the same reasons many men did at that time, said her husband: ''She wanted to do something for her country.''         Mrs. Jones became one of the first African-American women commissioned as an officer in the Women's Army Corps. At the time, African-Americans were limited to 10 percent of the overall troops, said the Army Center of Military History. When 400 women were accepted as officer candidates for the WAC's, the 40 black women became known as the Ten Percenters.         Ordered to Fort Breckenridge, Kan., after her basic training, she became the executive officer of a company that consisted of 175 black women. Even though many of the women had college educations, they were assigned to cleaning floors and latrines in the hospital and working in the post laundry.         Mrs. Jones complained to a superior officer, and persuaded him to reassign them to other duties, according to a book about the 6888th Battalion, ''To Serve My Country, To Serve My Race,'' (New York University Press, 1996) by Brenda L. Moore.         After the war, Major Barnes returned to Howard to complete her degree. She then did graduate work in American history at the University of Minnesota.         She was recalled to active duty in 1949, and placed in command of a training company at Fort Lee, Va. After her marriage in 1953, her husband was transferred to Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland and she to Fort Belvoir, Va. Later they were both sent, separately, to France, and then she was assigned as a special services officer in Kansas. She retired as chief of administration at Maison Fort in France and later accompanied her husband to a post in Germany.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Evelyn Graham Irons, a war correspondent who had a romance with the Bloomsbury novelist and poet Vita Sackville-West, died April 3 at her home in Brewster, N.Y. She was two months short of her 100th birthday.         Ms. Irons was a 30-year-old editor of the women's page of The Daily Mail in London when she met Sackville-West in 1931. She had gone to interview the 38-year-old writer at her home, Sissinghurst Castle, renowned for its famous gardens, which Sackville-West spent much of her life designing and tending.         The romance was tangled. Sackville-West had already begun her enduring relationship with Violet Trefusis, the daughter of Alice Keppel, Edward VII's mistress. And Ms. Irons was romantically involved at the time with Olive Rinder, who soon also fell in love with Sackville-West.         Victoria Glendenning wrote in her 1983 biography, ''Vita: The Life of Vita Sackville-West,'' that by January 1932, the three women were in a menage a trois that ended later that year when Ms. Irons met and fell in love with another woman, Joy McSweeney. Ms. McSweeney remained her companion until she died in the 1980's.         The love poems dated 1931 in Vita Sackville-West's ''Collected Poems'' are addressed to Ms. Irons, although Ms. Glendenning notes that ''the more erotic ones'' were never published. Ms. Irons and Sackville-West remained close friends and corresponded warmly until Sackville-West's death in 1962.         Evelyn Irons was born in Glasgow on June 17, 1900. After graduating from Somerville College, Oxford, she began working as a journalist for The Daily Mail, then The Evening Standard. At the outbreak of World War II, The Standard made her a war correspondent. Suspecting that British commanders would not welcome a woman at their headquarters, she accredited herself to the First French Army and crossed the Rhine with Charles de Gaulle and accompanied French troops through Germany and Austria.         She is believed to be the first female war correspondent to reach Hitler's retreat at Berchtesgaden and was the first to win the Croix de Guerre.         Ms. Irons moved to New York in 1952. In 1954, she rode into Guatemala on a mule during a revolution there, getting to the action and filing her dispatches well ahead of her colleagues. She became the New York bureau chief for The Sunday Times of London at the end of the 1950's.         No immediate family members survive her.       
         Dina Abramowicz, the longtime librarian at the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research whose firsthand and encyclopedic knowledge of the lost Yiddish world of Eastern Europe made her a treasured resource for hundreds of scholars and writers for more than half a century, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.         She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Abramowicz had a formidable memory, and not only for those who peopled her cherished birthplace, Vilna, Lithuania, the great center of Yiddish culture now known as Vilnius, where the YIVO collection originated.         Her mind was a mental card catalog for hundreds of rare and obscure books and historical materials in the dusty YIVO stacks. And she hunted them down for scholars like Irving Howe and novelists like Leon Uris as well as for thousands of ordinary people trying to research their family histories.         When George F. Kennan, the diplomat and historian, was looking for material one day on a 19th century convert to Christianity, she led him not only to the entry in the library's precious Russian-Jewish encyclopedia but also to a scarce book in Yiddish about Jewish apostates.         ''This is the sort of book that Dina knew off the top of her head,'' said Zachary Baker, who succeeded Ms. Abramowicz as YIVO's head librarian and now is curator of Judaica at Stanford University's library.         Her friend Esther Hautzig, a Manhattan book editor and writer who grew up in Vilna, said of her, ''No computer on earth can store the information she had in her brain because she lived through it.'' She remembers Ms. Abramowicz as the librarian who provided her with her first library card.         Almost daily, Ms. Abramowicz received inquiries from journalists and writers who liked to season their prose with a word or two of Yiddish. They relied on Ms. Abramowicz as their authority for the transliterated spelling of words like bobe (grandmother) and yichus (pedigree).         Though less than five feet tall and dainty in an Old World way, Ms. Abramowicz could be flintlike in her insistence upon historical and linguistic accuracy. When a letter to The New York Times stated that the word ''Holocaust'' was first used in the Dec. 24, 1942, daily bulletin of the Jewish Telegraphic Agency, she made sure to write a corrective letter. The agency's bulletin, she pointed out, used a term translatable as atrocities, not Holocaust, and the probable first use of Holocaust to refer to the mass slaughter of Jews was from the May 14, 1943, Polish daily Nowy Dzien, which used the Polish word for holocaust, calopalenie, to describe the liquidation of the Warsaw Ghetto.         Her life, sorrowful as parts of it were, had a striking symmetry, from Vilna to the New York home of the archives rescued from Vilna.         Vilna was fiercely loved by its Jewish inhabitants as the ''Jerusalem of Lithuania,'' a city of writers like Chaim Grade and Abraham Sutzkever. Ms. Abramowicz was the librarian first of Vilna's Jewish children's library and then, after the Nazis herded Jews into ghettos, of the ghetto library. When she came to New York in 1946, she soon went to work for the transplanted version of one of Vilna's most important institutions, the YIVO library, many of whose thousands of books and artifacts had been smuggled out by a ragtag band of slave laborers and partisans known as the paper brigade.         She was YIVO's head librarian for 25 years, until 1987; then in her late 70's, she was eased off to work as research librarian, a position she held until her death.         The daughter of teachers, Ms. Abramowicz was born in 1909, when Vilna was part of the czar's empire; it was to live under Polish, Lithuanian, German and Soviet Russian governments before she left. She grew up speaking Russian, but when the Germans occupied Vilna during World War I, they allowed Jews to start their own schools, as part of a divide-and-conquer strategy, and Dina's parents sent her to Yiddish-language elementary and high schools.         After studying Polish literature in university, she went to work for her first library, the Kinderbibliotek. She also became a member of YIVO, the  acronym for the Yiddish name of the Yiddish Scientific Institute, an organization founded in 1925. It soon became a repository of manuscripts of Sholem Aleichem and Biaklik, records of Jewish communal governments and other historical documents as well as thousands of books.         When the Germans invaded in World War II and crammed Vilna's 56,000 Jews into neighborhood ghettos, Herman Kruk, a librarian, tried to maintain an oasis of normality in the madness by setting up a library, and he asked Ms. Abramowicz to staff it.         ''How can we think of a library under these conditions, and who will come to read books there?'' she remembered asking a fellow librarian.         ''Since there was nothing one could do about this absurd situation, what was the use of talking and wondering?'' was the answer she remembered getting.         In its first year, the library circulated 100,000 books to its starving, brutalized readers, mostly, it turned out, escapist fiction.         In September 1943, the ghetto was liquidated. Ms. Abramowicz's mother was dispatched to Treblinka, where she was killed; Ms. Abramowicz to a labor camp. By a stroke of fortune, the door on the cattle train opened on the Vilna platform and she simply walked off. She wound up in a less rigorous camp, one for workers who processed fur for the German army's winter coats. She escaped into the woods and joined Jewish resistance fighters as a nurse's helper.         After the war, she found her father in New York, where he had traveled just before the war broke out in September 1939. She soon met Max Weinreich, a surviving YIVO founder, and joined him in reconstituting the YIVO collection in New York.         Beyond helping scholars who visited the Vanderbilt mansion that for years housed YIVO and its new home on West 16th Street, Ms. Abramowicz seemed to take on the search for roots as a personal compulsion.         ''At certain periods of your life, you start to want to find out what happened to your parents,'' she said once. ''I think it is the survival instinct of a people trying to find out who they are.''         Other than two nephews and a niece, Ms. Abramowicz left no survivors. But her name endures in dozens of acknowledgments by the authors whose research she shepherded. In his tribute in ''The World of Our Fathers,'' the classic work about the immigrant Jews of New York,  Mr. Howe thanked YIVO for making the book possible, ''especially its indefatigable and splendid librarian, Dina Abramowicz.''       
         Phyllis Propp Fowle, a New York lawyer who was the first woman to be an officer of the Army judge advocate general's corps, died Thursday in Manhattan. She was 92 and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.         She was also the only woman in the corps to serve overseas during World War II. Colonel Propp, as she was known to her former Army colleagues, was made a distinguished member of the corps at a banquet in her honor in April 1999 at the Judge Advocate General's School in Charlottesville, Va.         A native of Laurel, Iowa, and a 1930 graduate of the University of Iowa, she earned her law degree there and was the only woman in the law school's class of 1933. She was working in the legal department of the Federal Land Bank in Omaha in 1942 when Congress opened the Army to women by creating the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps. She was in the first group to sign up.         As a captain in 1942, she persuaded the Army to transfer her to the judge advocate general's corps. In January 1945 she reported to European Command headquarters in Paris.         She rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and processed hundreds of legal cases in Frankfurt and Heidelberg, Germany. One involved the Hessian crown jewels, purloined by three Army officers from Kronburg castle outside Frankfurt. Early in 1947, when the Army discharged all its women, it asked Colonel Propp to remain as the civilian chief of legal assistance, which she did until 1951.         From then until the 1970's, while she was in private practice in Manhattan, she served as an advocate general in the Army Reserve, encouraging female law students to follow her path into the corps. She formally retired from practice two years ago.         Mrs. Fowle is survived by her husband, Farnsworth Fowle, a retired New York Times reporter and former foreign correspondent, whom she married in Europe 49 years ago.       
         Ruth Werner, a colorful and successful Soviet spy whose exploits included radioing invaluable atomic bomb data to Moscow in the middle of World War II, died on July 7 in Berlin. She was 93.         In her 20 years as an intelligence operative in China, Poland, Switzerland and England, she had a number of close calls. But she always managed to extricate herself from the predicament -- unlike Klaus Fuchs, the agent who fed her the British atomic bomb secrets, who was imprisoned in Britain for nine and a half years, or Richard Sorge, the master spy who recruited her, who was executed in Japan in 1941.         Her espionage work was entwined with her romantic life, which included an affair with one of her spy chiefs; later she married a British Communist to become a British citizen and only later came to love him. She told some but not all of her story in a 1974 autobiography, still observing the iron rules of conspiracy by never mentioning Mr. Fuchs, who was still alive.         Ms. Werner was known by the code name Sonja, which was given to her by Mr. Sorge in 1933. Ruth Werner was her pen name. All of her identities had their roots in a prosperous Jewish household in Berlin, where she was born Ursula Ruth Kuczynski, one of six children of Robert Rene and Berta Kuczynski. Her father was a distinguished economist.         Ms. Werner was drawn early to the Communist movement and became a member of the German Communist Party at 19. She was immediately fired by the publishing house where she worked. Soon afterward she met and married Rolf Hamburger, an architect.         She started writing for the party newspaper, Rote Fahne. In 1930, having been told by the party that she would be contacted in Shanghai, she moved with her husband to China.         They began a pleasant bourgeois life, but she was waiting impatiently for the promised contact. It took four months and friendship with Agnes Smedley, an American leftist journalist, who introduced her to Mr. Sorge. Mr. Sorge, then 35, had been the Shanghai agent of the Soviet Army's intelligence service for a year. The service was known by its Russian initials, G.R.U.         Mr. Sorge asked whether she was ready to face danger. She nodded and agreed to make room available for his clandestine meetings with Chinese Communists, the chief interest of Moscow.         Ms. Werner joined the ring without her husband's knowledge, stored weapons and hid a Chinese comrade who was on the run. Two years later, when Mr. Sorge left Shanghai for Moscow, he recommended her to the G.R.U.         Though her marriage was deteriorating, she and her husband had had a son, Michael, while in Shanghai. When the G.R.U. asked her to go to Moscow for training, she left the boy with in-laws in Czechoslovakia.         In the G.R.U. school she learned Morse code, Russian and how to build radio transmitters and receivers. In February 1934 she was sent to turbulent Manchuria, which had been seized from China by the Japanese. Her boss was Ernst, a former sailor, with whom she became romantically involved.         ''Our transmitter was the link between the partisans and the Soviet Union,'' she wrote. She sent coded messages twice a week, and bought and transported chemicals for explosives for the Chinese Communist partisans.         In 1935, Moscow, fearing the two spies were about to be exposed, ordered Ms. Werner and Ernst to flee China. She accepted an assignment in Poland, this time with her husband, although she was pregnant with Ernst's child. Her daughter, Janina, was born in April 1936.         In late 1938 she was sent to Switzerland to set up a new spy ring, again with her husband, but he soon left her and went to the Far East. In February 1939 she met Len Beurton, an English Communist who had fought in Spain with the international brigades. For him, he once wrote, it was ''love at first sight; she had a very good figure.''         In 1940, the G.R.U. authorized a marriage of convenience by which Ms. Werner became British, but the love came to be mutual -- the marriage lasted until his death three years ago.         Ms. Werner had already begun clandestine transmissions from a radio set she had built in her rented house near Oxford when, in 1941, she met Mr. Fuchs, who was working at the British atomic research facility nearby.         The two spies would bicycle into the countryside for their meetings, and Mr. Fuchs would hand over written materials that, Ms. Werner once told an interviewer, were ''like hieroglyphics.''         Norman Moss, author of ''Klaus Fuchs: The Man Who Stole the Atomic Bomb'' (1987), said that Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's chief aide, set up the Soviet atomic bomb project in 1942 as a result of the information transmitted by Mr. Fuchs and Ms. Werner, and that the information saved the Soviet researchers a great deal of time. The Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb in 1949.         Ms. Werner was also running other agents, including a Royal Air Force officer, a specialist in submarine radar and even her brother and father. She was once told that the chief of G.R.U. had said, ''If we had five Sonjas in England, the war would end sooner.''         In the early 1950's she and her family -- another son, Peter, had been born in 1943 -- left England for East Berlin. Her only connection with the G.R.U. after that was in 1969, when she was invited to a ceremony to receive her second Red Banner, the highest Soviet military decoration.         She turned to writing, producing some short stories; a biography of Olga Benario, a German Communist who was gassed by the Nazis in 1942; and her autobiography.         She is survived by her three children, five grandchildren and three sisters.       
         Constance Stuart Larrabee, a photographer who recorded the vanishing tribes of southern Africa, the World War II battlefields of Europe and her life on Maryland's tranquil Eastern Shore, died on July 27 at her home in Chestertown, Md. She was 85.         Known as Constance Stuart earlier in her career, Mrs. Larrabee in 1997 donated her African images to the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of African Art, her World War II pictures to the Corcoran Gallery and her views of the Eastern Shore to the Chesapeake Bay Maritime Museum.         All three institutions simultaneously exhibited those collections in 1998. A traveling display, titled ''South Africa, 1936-1949 -- Photographs by Constance Stuart Larrabee,'' is being readied for a national tour by the Museum of African Art.         Yale University staged a 120-picture retrospective in 1995, presenting the remarkable panoply of her work. It opened with family portraits of Ndebele people in tribal garb, particularly of mothers with infants, and other tribal groups at work, rest and play.         She photographed South African soldiers fighting their way up the Italian boot, as well as the liberation of Paris, with Gen. Charles de Gaulle, in profile, addressing a crowd. Finally, the show ended on a genteel note in Maryland, where she bred Norwich and Norfolk terriers on a farm and depicted the rivers and creeks, wildlife and people of her surroundings.         Two of her South African photographs were included in Edward Steichen's famous international exhibition and collection of the mid-1950's, ''The Family of Man.'' The Museum of Modern Art billed it as ''the greatest photographic exhibition of all time,'' and she shared the credits with the likes of Margaret Bourke-White, Frank Capra and Henri Cartier-Bresson.         Born in England, Mrs. Larrabee grew up in Pretoria, South Africa, and studied photography in London and Munich. In 1936 she started a portrait studio in Pretoria to capture the white South African elite along with visitors like Noel Coward and members of the British royal family.         Apart from her commercial work, she began to chronicle the vanishing ethnic cultures of Bushmen, Transkei peoples and others in the region. Her exhibitions drew national attention and led to her appointment as a war photographer.         She accompanied the South African Sixth Armored Division and the American Sixth Army as they swept through Europe. At one point she came under German artillery fire aboard a French tank.         She arrived in the United States in 1949, married Col. Sterling Loop Larrabee and settled in Chestertown, where she established a long association with Washington College. She supported its arts programs and helped establish the Constance Stuart Larrabee Arts Center.         Her husband died in 1975. No immediate family members survive.       
         Frieda Mae Hardin, who joined the Navy during World War I, when women were still denied the right to vote, and at a widely noted ceremony  79 years later symbolized the achievements of all the women in the armed forces, died last Wednesday in Livermore, Calif. She was 103.         Wearing a World War I ''yeomanette'' uniform and a wide-brimmed hat inscribed with ''U.S. Naval Reserve,'' Mrs. Hardin provided the emotional high point at the ceremony, held in October 1997 at Arlington National Cemetery to dedicate the Women in Military Service for America Memorial, honoring almost  two million women who had served.         Making her way to the speaker's stand before an audience estimated at 30,000, Mrs. Hardin was accompanied by her son Jerald Kirsten, a retired Navy captain.         ''Loud voice, mother,'' he said.         Mrs. Hardin's audience heard her loud and clear. ''In my 101 years of living, I have observed many wonderful achievements, but none as important or as meaningful as the progress of women taking their  rightful place in society,'' she said.         ''To those women now in military service, I say, 'Carry on.' To those  young women who may be thinking about a career in the military service, I say, 'Go for it.' ''         The 10-minute talk brought three standing ovations and left many in the crowd in tears.         When Frieda Mae Green was born on Sept. 22, 1896, in Eden Valley,  Minn., a formal role for women in the armed forces could hardly have been foreseen. Women had served in a quasi-military capacity, as nurses, but there were no women in the regular Navy or Army.         In March 1917, however, with America's entry into World War I imminent, Navy Secretary Josephus Daniels called on women to enlist in the Naval Reserve to free sailors for combat duty.         Frieda's father, a railroad worker, had moved the family to Kentucky and then Ohio, and she had taken a job at a department store in the town of Portsmouth. One day in 1918, she saw a notice that a Navy recruiter was arriving. ''I heard about the Navy taking women on a Saturday night, and I signed up first thing Monday morning,'' she would recall.         According to her son Jerald, when she phoned her mother to tell her what she had done, ''Her mother said, 'Frieda, you get home this instant!' '' Frieda's mother took her back to the recruiting station and told the Navy man that she could not sign up without her father's permission. But the next day, her father said, ''Let her go,'' and off she went.         She was among almost 12,000 women who served in the Navy during World War I as clerks, draftsmen, translators, camouflage designers and recruiters. They were  formally designated yeomen (f), for female, but were known as yeomanettes. She was on active duty from September 1918 to March 1919 at the Norfolk Navy Yard in Virginia, performing clerical duties and receiving an outstanding grade in reading proficiency and perfect marks in obedience and sobriety, the three areas in which the Navy graded women. (She would remain a teetotaler, even refusing a glass of celebratory champagne while flying to the 1997 memorial ceremony.)         By 1920, all the yeomanettes were released from duty, and women would not be permitted to serve in the Navy again until the Waves were established in World War II.         After leaving the Navy, Frieda Green married William Kirsten, a chef, and they settled in the Lodi-Stockton area of California. She remained in Northern California the rest of her life, and had been a resident of a Livermore nursing home for several years when she died there last week.         She is survived by four children from her marriage to Mr. Kirsten: Captain Kirsten, of Lodi, Roy Kirsten of Stockton and Warren Kirsten of Sacramento, all military veterans, and Mary Botto of Stockton; 12 grandchildren; 25 great-grandchildren; and 29 great-great-grandchildren. William Kirsten and three other husbands died before her, the last of them Robert Hardin.         In speaking at the memorial dedication, Mrs. Hardin said that ''a world of opportunity'' awaited women in the military.         ''For my part, I have always been very proud of my Navy service,'' she  told the audience. ''It is not likely that I will be meeting with you again,  so I bid each of you a fond farewell.''         Among those in the crowd was a woman named Ann Darr, who had served during World War II in the Women's Air Force Service Pilots, or Wasps. Reflecting on that moment at the memorial, she would write, ''When Frieda Mae Hardin spoke, reminding us she couldn't vote when she signed up, saying to the young people, 'Go for it!' we were almost ready to serve again.''       
         Miki Denhof, one of the first women to be the art director of a magazine, and a noted mentor of fashion photographers, died on Wednesday at her home in East Hampton, N.Y. She was 88.         In 1945, when Ms. Denhof joined Conde Nast, its fashion and lifestyle magazines were widely influential for their use of elegant typography and conceptual photography, approaches in which she, too, excelled. The executive art director, Alexander Liberman, installed Ms. Denhof as promotion art director of Vogue. There, ''she was a creative force and arbiter of quality,'' said a friend and colleague, Estelle Ellis.         ''She also developed a keen ability to edit pictures into narrative sequences and was deft with type,'' Ms. Ellis continued. ''She transcended the conventions of advertising design at that time.''         Later named the editorial art director for House and Garden and Glamour magazines, Ms. Denhof collaborated with Mr. Liberman, refining the typographic and photographic styles that characterized those publications.         But she was not simply a stylist. ''Miki always had a sense of the big picture,'' said Don Wise, who was art director of the Glamour promotion art department in the 1950's. ''She designed in an intellectual way, using words as integral parts of her pictures. Now designers routinely integrate type and image, but she did it before most others.''         In the 60's, at Glamour, she nurtured and mentored many American and European-emigre photographers, including David Bailey, Frank Horvat, Jeanloup Sieff, Louis Faurer and Saul Leiter.         ''She was the only art director I wouldn't question,'' Mr. Bailey said. ''She could put 22 pictures on a spread and I wouldn't worry. She'd always do it right.''         Ms. Denhof was born in 1912 in Trieste, Italy, raised in Austria and educated in Vienna and Berlin. She left Germany for New York with her family in 1938.         One of her earliest design jobs was as an assistant to the Modernist designer Paul Rand at Esquire and Apparel Arts magazines. She was also art director of Conde Nast Books, responsible for such titles as ''Vanity Fair: Photographs of an Age 1914-1936'' with Diane Edkins, and ''The Successful Face'' with Amy Green.         After leaving Conde Nast in 1977 she designed exhibitions, catalogs and a documentary book for the Guild Hall in East Hampton, which also mounted an exhibition of her editorial layouts.         She spent the last few years archiving the photo albums and diaries of her father, Bernhard Bardach, a doctor in the Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. Recently she donated 900 of the photographs to the Leo Baeck Institute in New York. Some were used in the 1999 exhibition ''Fighting for the Fatherland: The Patriotism of Jews in World War I.''         Ms. Denhof was divorced from Hans Denhof, who is deceased. She has no immediate survivors.       
         Mary MacLeod Trump, a philanthropist who supported charities near her home in Jamaica, Queens, and elsewhere, died on Monday at 88 at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, her family said.         Mrs. Trump was born Mary MacLeod on the Isle of Lewis in Scotland on May 10, 1912. On a visit to New York City in the 1930's, she met Fred C. Trump. They married in 1936 and settled in Jamaica Estates, and Mr. Trump went on to become one of the city's biggest developers.         Mrs. Trump was the mainstay of the Women's Auxiliary of Jamaica Hospital and of the Jamaica Day Nursery. The Trumps were also active in the Salvation Army, the Boy Scouts of America and the Lighthouse for the Blind, among others. A pavilion at Jamaica Hospital Medical Center bears their name. They also gave buildings to the National Kidney Foundation of New York/ New Jersey and to Community Mainstreaming Associates of Great Neck, N.Y., which provides homes for the disabled.         Mr. Trump died last year. Mrs. Trump is survived by four children: Donald, the developer and casino operator; Robert, the president of his father's property management company; Maryanne, a federal judge on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals; Elizabeth, an executive with Chase Manhattan Bank; eight grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.
