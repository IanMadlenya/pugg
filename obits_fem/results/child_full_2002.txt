         Peggy Lee, whose sultry singing style set standards for pop jazz sophistication for more than half a century, died on Monday night at her home in Los Angeles. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Nicki Lee Foster. Ms. Lee had surmounted many medical problems to continue performing until the last few years.         She was billed throughout most of her career as Miss Peggy Lee (and, in fact, she insisted on it). In the golden age of big bands she was a singer of renown with Benny Goodman's orchestra and she went on to become a top nightclub singer, a prolific recording artist, a successful songwriter and an actress skillful enough to be nominated for an Oscar.         Duke Ellington called her ''the Queen.'' She was a weaver of moods and colors, her misty voice conveying impeccable rhythmic subtlety and smoldering sexuality. In a world of belters, she was a minimalist who eliminated any hint of the extraneous in both her voice and gestures, and she could stir audiences with an understated phrase more than most singers could by shouting and stomping.         Stephen Holden, a movie and cabaret critic for The New York Times, described her image as ''Billie Holiday meets Mae West.''         Miss Lee made more than 700 recordings and more than 60 albums. Her own favorite album, ''The Man I Love,'' was recorded in 1957 with arrangements by Nelson Riddle and an orchestra conducted by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra was so intimately involved with the album that he obtained some menthol to make Miss Lee's eyes look properly misty for the cover photograph.         She is credited with having a hand in writing more than 200 songs, in most cases as a lyricist. Among the hits she wrote were ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana (Is Soon Enough for Me).'' Her name is indelibly linked with a number of songs, including ''Golden Earrings,'' ''Fever,'' ''Lover,'' ''Big Spender,'' ''You're My Thrill,'' ''I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ''Them There Eyes'' and the haunting Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller tune that became her signature in later years, ''Is That All There Is?''         ''She makes her listeners feel cherished,'' Whitney Balliett wrote of her in The New Yorker. ''Her singing lulls you, and it is easy to forget how daring it is. Many singers confuse shouting with emotion. Peggy Lee sends her feelings down the quiet center of her notes.''         ''She is a subtle and brilliant showman,'' he added. ''She can slink, arch an eyebrow, pull out a hip and rest a hand on it, half smile, wave wandlike arms, bump, tilt her head and slouch -- all to dazzling, precise effect.''         Miss Lee was named Norma Deloris Egstrom at her birth on May 27, 1920, in Jamestown, N.D. She was the sixth of seven children of Marvin and Selma Egstrom. Her father was a railroad station agent who drank too much. His job kept the family moving from town to town in lonely parts of North Dakota. Her mother died when she was 4 and her father remarried. Five-year-old Norma was brutally abused by her stepmother, who would hit her over the head with an iron skillet, beat her with a razor strap and drag her around by her hair. By the age of 7, she was keeping house, baking, cooking, cleaning and milking cows.         There was never any doubt in her mind that she would become a singer. ''I had always sung -- I sang before I could talk,'' she reminisced in her 1989 autobiography, ''Miss Peggy Lee'' (Donald I. Fine). She was 14 when she made her professional debut at a local radio station in Jamestown and was still a teenager when a program director at a radio station in Fargo gave her a job and her stage name. The job paid $1.50 for each noonday show. To make ends meet, she worked a 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift in a bakery, slicing and wrapping bread for 35 cents an hour.         A friend who had gone to California suggested she join her. She sold the watch her father had given her at her high school graduation for $30, bought a train ticket and arrived in Hollywood with $18. She got a brief singing engagement in a supper club but mostly worked as a waitress before returning to North Dakota. She found work singing for a radio station in Fargo, then as a singer in Minneapolis with Will Osborne's band.         Miss Lee was discovered in Chicago in 1941 by Benny Goodman, who was looking for a replacement for his vocalist, Helen Forrest, who was leaving to join Artie Shaw's band. He heard her sing ''These Foolish Things'' at the Ambassador West Hotel and called the next day, offering her the job. She had a cold the first night she appeared, the critics were unkind, and she wanted to quit. Goodman refused to let her go and she stayed on, at $75 a week.         Later that year, the band played the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, and Miss Lee recalled in her autobiography how awed she had been to see Franchot Tone dancing by with Joan Crawford, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne chatting at their table with Katharine Cornell, and Gary Cooper joking with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.         It was Miss Lee's sulky rendition of ''Why Don't You Do Right?'' with the Goodman band in 1942 that made her a star. She sang the Joe McCoy song in a voice that demonstrated she could sing of hard times as well as anybody; her version became one of the the biggest selling records in the country:         You had plenty money nineteen twen'y-two         You let other women make a fool of you         Why don't you do right         Like some other men do?         Get out of here and get me some money, too.         Peggy Lee's tour with the Goodman band lasted less than two years but the collaboration made her one of the most famous female vocalists of the time and put her on the road to fame.         In 1943, Miss Lee left Goodman to marry Dave Barbour, the band's guitarist, with whom she collaborated on a number of hits, including ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Mañana,'' a 1948 blockbuster that sold more than two million records and began her long association with Latin-flavored music.         Her swirling 1952 version of the Richard Rodgers waltz ''Lover'' and her 1958 interpretation of ''Fever'' in six-eight time solidified her reputation as one of the most rhythmically inventive and versatile vocalists in pop.         She made her film debut in 1950, playing a minor role in ''Mr. Music,'' and went on, in 1953, to play a featured role opposite Danny Thomas in a remake of ''The Jazz Singer.'' Her performance as an alcoholic blues singer in ''Pete Kelly's Blues'' (1955) won her an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress.         In 1959 she wrote the lyrics for a Duke Ellington song, ''I'm Gonna Go Fishing,'' for the film ''Anatomy of a Murder.''         She also wrote theme music for the movies ''Johnny Guitar'' and ''About Mrs. Leslie,'' and supplied voices for several characters and sang three songs in the 1952 Walt Disney animated film ''Lady and the Tramp.'' She was paid $3,500 by Disney and no royalties. When Disney marketed a videocassette without her consent, she sued the company. In 1992, after a four-year court battle, she was awarded $2.3 million.         Another lawsuit over royalties neared an end last week in Los Angeles, when a superior court judge gave preliminary approval for a $4.75-million settlement between Universal Music Group and several hundred recording artists whose lead plaintiff was Miss Lee. Universal acquired Miss Lee's contract and many others through a series of record company mergers over the years. The suit asserted that Universal had cheated artists by underreporting sales figures and overcharging for services. The company has admitted no wrongdoing, and language in the settlement bars both sides from commenting.         Peggy Lee was a perfectionist who planned every aspect of her performances right down to her hairdos, her costly gowns, her lighting, her entrances and exits, even the movement of her hands. She always appeared with first-rate musicians, including the drummer Grady Tate. For decades, because of respiratory problems that began with a bout of viral pneumonia in 1958, she kept oxygen in her dressing room, and she used it between sets.         Miss Lee's performances at Basin Street East in Manhattan beginning in 1959 were credited by Newsweek with ''single-handedly reviving the supper club business.'' Count Basie, Tallulah Bankhead, Cary Grant, Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald were some of the notables who crowded in every night. With more than 600 people in a space meant for 450, a club representative recalled later, ''we had to hire only skinny waiters.''         Her appearances at the Ballroom, a club in Chelsea, were also treated as events.         Miss Lee was married five times, but her great love, she acknowledged, was her first husband and collaborator, Mr. Barbour. He was the father of her only child, Nicki Lee Foster, of Sun Valley, Idaho. In addition to Ms. Foster, she is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Miss Lee described Mr. Barbour in her autobiography as a self-destructive alcoholic. They were married in 1943 and she said in a 1982 interview that he asked her for a divorce in 1951, ''because he didn't want his daughter to see him with his problem.'' In 1965, after Mr. Barbour had been sober for many years, they decided to remarry, but a few days later he died.         Her second marriage, in 1955, to Brad Dexter, an actor, lasted less than a year, and her third, in 1956, to Dewey Martin, also an actor, ended in divorce in 1959. A fourth marriage, in 1964, to Jack Del Rio, a bandleader, also lasted less than a year.         Besides chronic respiratory problems, Miss Lee encountered a number of serious illnesses and accidents over the years.         Late in the 1970's, she returned to San Francisco from a European tour so ill she was immediately hospitalized. Doctors informed her she had a bad heart, diabetes and a disorder of the inner ear; she also went blind temporarily. She was told to retire but went to Australia on tour instead.         She had double-bypass heart surgery in 1985. Two years later she fell onstage at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and fractured her pelvis. When she recovered, she fell again in the marble bathroom of her home in Bel Air section of Los Angeles, injuring the vertebrae in her lower spine.         Still she performed.         ''Peg,'' her musical autobiography, had a hard time on Broadway in 1983, and closed after 13 previews and five performances. It was a rare failure.         She usually appeared in slinky satin or form-fitting glittering gowns, drop-dead dangling earrings and large round tinted glasses. Later, a shoulder length white-blond wig covered her champagne-blond hair. Still later, she used a jeweled cane and often performed sitting down like Mabel Mercer. She had more heart problems in the early 1990's, her daughter said, and suffered a stroke in 1998 that left her bedridden. In 1992, Mr. Holden reviewed a Peggy Lee performance in New York for The Times and wrote that ''her will power, musicality and professionalism enable her to project a fair degree of the old magic.''         In 1990, she received the Pied Piper Award of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers,  Ascap's highest accolade, given for lifetime achievement.         During her last decade, she tried to retire several times. She painted (one of her paintings hung on the wall of Les Célébrités, a former restaurant in the Essex House in Manhattan), grew roses, watched nature programs on television, was active in the Science of Mind spiritual group,  and listened to Ray Charles, Sinatra, Debussy and Chopin. But it wasn't enough. So she would reappear periodically in smaller settings, basking in the warmth of her audiences.         Obituary       
         Astrid Lindgren, the Swedish writer whose rollicking, anarchic books about Pippi Longstocking rattled some tradition-bound Swedes when they first appeared almost 60 years ago but came to captivate millions of children around the world, died yesterday at her home in Stockholm. She was 94.         Mrs. Lindgren, who began publishing in the 1940's, became one of the world's most widely translated authors. In addition to being a beloved cultural figure in Sweden, she was also a powerful political force, successfully lobbying on issues like tax reform and improved conditions for farm animals.         Although Mrs. Lindgren produced more than 70 books for young people, she was best known as the author of the classic ''Pippi Longstocking,'' first published in Sweden in 1945 and in the United States five years later. The title character is a 9-year-old carrot-haired enfant terrible who lives cheerfully by herself in the ramshackle Villa Villekulla and befriends her better behaved, better groomed neighbors, Tommy and Annika.         ''She had no mother and no father, and that was of course very nice because there was no one to tell her to go to bed just when she was having the most fun, and no one who could make her take cod liver oil when she much preferred caramel candy,'' the book begins.         ''Pippi'' and its sequels have together sold millions of copies and been translated into more than 50 languages. The sheer subversive quality of the books, whose brazen young heroine does exactly as she pleases, made them unusual for juvenile literature.         ''Bertrand Russell has written that a child dreams about power as grown-ups dream sexual wish dreams,'' Mrs. Lindgren said in a 1985 interview. ''This is a child who has power. That is wonderful, for children to think, 'Oh, if I were like Pippi! I could say to Father, '' 'You don't do that!' ''         ''She has power, but she never misuses that power,'' Ms. Lindgren said, ''which I think is the most splendid thing, and the most difficult.''         Mrs. Lindgren was born Astrid Anna Emilia Ericsson on Nov. 14, 1907, the second of four children of Samuel August and Hanna Jonsson Ericsson, in Vimmerby, in southern Sweden. Her father was a tenant farmer, and Mrs. Lindgren grew up outside Vimmerby at Nas, a 500-year-old farm, in an old red house surrounded by apple orchards.         ''Rocks and trees were as close to us as living beings, and nature protected and nurtured our playing and our dreaming,'' she wrote in a 1973 memoir. ''Whatever our imagination could call forth was enacted in the land around us -- all fairy tales, all adventures we invented or read about or heard about, all of it happened there, and only there. Even our songs and prayers had their places in surrounding nature.''         The pastoral idyll of Mrs. Lindgren's youth came to an end in 1926, when, 19 and unmarried, she became pregnant. She fled to Copenhagen, where she gave birth to a son, Lars, and later settled in Stockholm.         To support herself, she took a secretarial job at the Royal Automobile Club in Stockholm. (Among Mrs. Lindgren's lesser known writing is the 1939 work ''Twenty-Five Automobile Tours in Sweden.'') In 1931 she married a co-worker, Sture Lindgren. Mrs. Lindgren, who was widowed in 1952, is survived by a sister, Stina Hergin; her daughter, Karin Nyman; seven grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren.         It was Karin who first conjured up Pippi. In 1941 when she was 7 she was sick in bed with pneumonia. Night after night she nagged her mother to tell her a story.         ''What should I tell?'' the exhausted Mrs. Lindgren asked one evening.         ''Tell about Pippi Langstrump'' -- Pippi Longstocking -- Karin replied, coining the name on the spot.         Her mother gamely complied.         ''I didn't ask her who Pippi Longstocking was,'' Mrs. Lindgren told The New Yorker in 1983. ''I just began the story, and since it was a strange name it turned out to be a strange girl as well.''         Pippilotta Delicatessa Windowshade Mackrelmint Efraim's daughter Longstocking was indeed a strange girl. Her fiery hair stuck straight out from either side of her head in two tight braids. She wore one black stocking and one brown, with black shoes twice as long as her feet. Her mother was long dead; her sailor father had been lost at sea, though Pippi was confident he had come ashore on a South Sea island where ''he had become king of all the cannibals.'' She had a horse and a monkey named Mr. Nilsson for company and a trunkful of gold pieces to provide for her wants.         Like many heroes of traditional Scandinavian lore, Pippi was fearless, ageless and endowed with superhuman strength.         But above all, Pippi was rude:  deeply, outrageously, satisfyingly rude. Invited to a fancy coffee party, she devoured an entire cream cake before the assembled guests.         The sequel ''Pippi Goes on Board'' was published in Sweden in 1946, followed by ''Pippi in the South Seas'' in 1948, ''Pippi on the Run'' in 1971 and several other Pippi stories not translated into English.         In the 1970's she stepped into public life to protest Sweden's income tax laws, which sent self-employed artists like Mrs. Lindgren and the director Ingmar Bergman reeling under a staggering tax burden. A lifelong supporter of the ruling Social Democratic Party, Mrs. Lindgren published a caustic newspaper satire before the 1976 election in which she calculated that, because of competing local and federal taxes, her income was taxed at an annual rate of 102 percent. The Social Democrats, in power for more than 40 years, were defeated, and tax cuts followed, events Mrs. Lindgren was sometimes credited with bringing about.         Although Mrs. Lindgren's career made her wealthy, she continued to live modestly in the same Stockholm apartment where ''Pippi Longstocking'' was first written, rising early to write in bed before going off to her editing job. She regarded her status as one of Sweden's best loved celebrities with characteristic quiet humor.         ''Perhaps this is because in Stockholm drunks come up and hug me all the time,'' she said in 1994. ''And I cannot be that impressed with anyone, except for God.''       
         Inge Morath, a photographer who brought a whimsical, lyrical touch to her images from travelogues to reportage to portraits, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in Roxbury, Conn.         Arthur Miller, her husband, said the cause of death was lymphoma.         ''She made poetry out of people and their places over half a century,'' Mr. Miller said.         Her work included striking portraits of both posed celebrities and fleeting images of anonymous passers-by. Her feeling for places as reflected in images of Boris Pasternak's home, Chekhov's house and Mao Zedong's bedroom was so sensitive that some viewers insisted they could see invisible people.         But many critics said the pictures spoke eloquently for themselves.         ''Inge Morath possesses the priceless quality of making the world look as though it had been discovered only this morning and she was present with her lens to record its bright freshness,'' Harrison E. Salisbury wrote in The New York Times Book Review about the couple's book ''In Russia'' (Viking, 1969).         In the later phases of her long career, Ms. Morath produced books with her husband: he provided words and she the pictures. Beyond their respective artistic talents, the books were enhanced by his easy access to top figures in culture and other fields and her great facility with languages. For example, she spent years learning Chinese before the couple tackled China.         In an essay in The New York Times concerning their book ''In the Country'' (Viking, 1977), Mr. Miller suggested such collaborations allowed the two to play with notions of time. ''As always, the camera sees the past -- all it can see -- and here it speaks of a symmetry of action and thought and a revolution based on empirical common sense, when in truth these people watch the television news for the event on Wall Street, in Washington or Korea that will affect the price of fertilizer and crops,'' he wrote. ''The surreal emerges from the fragility of what camera and mind can grasp as real.''         Inge Mörath (with umlaut over the o) was born on May 27, 1923, in Graz, Austria. (She lost the umlaut somewhere in her international career.) Her parents, both scientists, were well off and brought her up in their liberal Protestant tradition. They moved frequently, and were living in Berlin at the outbreak of World War II.         She was drafted to work in an airplane factory with Ukrainian prisoners of war after she declined to be a Nazi supporter. The factory was regularly bombed; after one bombing, she remembered running through the streets of the devastated city holding a bouquet of lilacs above her head. In an interview with Joyce Wadler that appeared in The New York Times on March 18, 1998, she recalled walking through the countryside and witnessing the horror of war.         ''Everyone was dead or half dead,'' she said. ''I walked by dead horses, by women with dead babies in their arms. I can't photograph war for this reason.''         After the war, she used the language expertise she had honed at the University of Berlin to translate for occupying Americans, and then to work as Austrian editor of an American government-controlled magazine. She began to write articles to accompany the photographs of Ernst Haas, and was invited to Paris by Robert Capa with Mr. Haas to serve as an editor of the just-founded Magnum agency.         She began photographing in London in 1951, and assisted Henri Cartier-Bresson as a researcher in 1953 and 1954. In 1955, after working two years as a photographer, she became a member of Magnum, which functions as a cooperative.         Her many foreign assignments included a trip to Iran for Holiday magazine in 1956; there she wore the traditional chador and traveled alone most of the time.         In the late 1950's she saved Audie Murphy, the actor and war hero, from drowning when he was in Mexico making a movie ''The Unforgiven.'' Ms. Morath jumped into a cold mountain lake in her underwear, swam a half-mile and dragged Mr. Murphy back by her bra strap -- at least in her telling.         Other notable assignments included shooting the stills in London for John Huston's film ''Moulin Rouge'' (1952), in which she had to make do with three rolls of color film because it was so scarce at the time. She developed a lifelong friendship with Mr. Huston, something she often did with her subjects. ''Photography is essentially a personal matter, a search for inner truth,'' she said.         In 1960, she was photographing the filming of ''The Misfits'' in Reno, Nev. One of the stars was Marilyn Monroe, who was accompanied by her husband at that time, Mr. Miller. She took a famous image of the two together: Mr. Miller, with his cigarette, Monroe leaning out the window with her back turned.         But she said that it was difficult to get them close enough together to photograph. The marriage soon broke up; Ms. Morath married Mr. Miller in 1962, and they had one child, Rebecca, who lives in Manhattan. Rebecca has one son.         Ms. Morath -- who practiced yoga, swam daily and was a vegetarian -- continued to photograph until two weeks ago. Elliott Erwitt, a veteran photographer for Magnum, remembered her as a wonderful hostess. ''It was kind of a permanent salon that she managed beautifully,'' he said. ''She was at ease in any situation.''       
         Hildegard Knef, the actress whose career emerged from the dark realism of German filmmaking that followed Hitler's defeat and then grew to encompass Broadway, recordings and a best-selling memoir, died yesterday in Berlin. She was 76.         Ms. Knef, whose name was often anglicized as Neff in cast lists for films and plays, died of a lung infection, The Associated Press reported. A heavy smoker for most of her life, she had suffered from emphysema and, earlier, from breast cancer.         In her heyday, Ms. Knef was often described by entertainment columnists as the ''willowy blonde'' with the ''dusky voice'' and the ''generous mouth.'' She made at least 30 films in the United States and Europe, but had a singular triumph in New York in 1954 as Don Ameche's co-star in the Cole Porter hit ''Silk Stockings.'' She portrayed the stolid Soviet commissar Ninotchka (one of Greta Garbo's major film roles), who yields to romance on a spree in Paris. She won raves. Brooks Atkinson, the drama critic for The New York Times, called the show one of Porter's best and described Ms. Knef's stage transformation as the corrupted commissar ''an immensely skillful performance.''         Her success also made her more acceptable to an initially chilly Hollywood film community, which had held her suspect for wartime adventures, later described in her searing memoir, ''The Gift Horse'' (McGraw-Hill, 1971).         Hildegard Frieda Albertina Knef was born on Dec. 28, 1925, in Ulm, Germany, the daughter of Hans Theodor and Friede Auguste Knef. He was a decorated World War I veteran who died six months after her birth. Her mother moved to Berlin to take up factory work. ''As a child I was extraordinarily shy, not at all talkative,'' she recalled in her memoir.         At 17 she left school to become an apprentice animator with U.F.A. (Universum Film Company). After a successful screen test, she transferred to the State Film School at Babelsberg, a Berlin suburb, to study acting, ballet and elocution. Her first stage part was one line in the Deutsches Theater. Josef Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, sent word that he wanted to meet her, but her friends kept her away from him.         Ms. Knef was bombed out of the family's apartment on New Year's Eve 1943. She was later wounded in an incendiary attack. In the last days of the war, Ewald von Demandowsky, a Nazi film director with whom she was in love, led her out of Berlin. On April 18, 1945, she wrote in her memoir, she donned a Wehrmacht uniform and the couple, armed with a submachine gun, pistol and hand grenades, tried to pass through Red Army lines to reach Allied territory. Captured and beaten, she was not discovered to be a woman until she was a prisoner of war in a camp in southeastern Germany among 40,000 German men.  Fellow prisoners helped her escape and make her way back to Berlin.         Before he was killed by his captors, Von Demandowsky directed Ms. Knef to go for protection to Viktor de Kowa, a well-known character actor, in Berlin. With permission from Soviet occupation authorities, de Kowa opened a theater with her as mistress of ceremonies. Soon she got a part in Marcel Pagnol's ''Marius,'' directed by Boleslaw Barlog, one of Germany's theater greats. He also directed her in plays by Shakespeare, Pagnol and George Abbott.         In 1946 Ms. Knef starred in Germany's first postwar movie, ''Murderers Are Among Us,'' in which she played a former concentration camp inmate returning home.         After a few years in Hollywood, she returned to Germany in 1950 to film ''Sinner,'' the story of a prostitute who falls in love with a painter who is going blind. The film caused a scandal when, in a scene of just a few seconds, Ms. Knef appeared nude. In a postwar Germany convulsed by guilt and shame, church leaders called for boycotts and thousands demonstrated against it.         ''A country that had Auschwitz and caused so much horror and then, a few years later, behaves in this manner because I was visible naked on the screen is utterly absurd,'' she wrote later. ''I had the scandal, the producers got the money.''         Among her other films were Anatole Litvak's ''Decision Before Dawn,'' a highly praised 1951 Hollywood film with Richard Basehart and Oskar Werner, about the last days of the war in Germany.         In ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro,'' (1952) she sang three Cole Porter songs. The composer saw the film and engaged her for ''Silk Stockings.'' She had had a bit of voice-  coaching as a teenager, but never considered herself a singer. Her delivery was described variously as ''mellow'' and ''rough and smoky.''         She began writing lyrics in the 1960's during a pause in her acting work and soon developed a successful concert and recording career.         Ms. Knef was married three times and divorced twice. Her first husband, Kurt Hirsch, was an American Army officer who took her to Hollywood in 1947. She later married David Anthony Palastranga, an actor and director, with whom she had a daughter, Christina. She is survived by her daughter and her third husband, Paul von Schell, according to The Associated Press.         Ms. Knef's later years were devoted to singing and writing. Returning to Europe after years in America she remarked, ''Everything when I arrived was under occupation by memories.''       
         Princess Margaret, the younger sister of Queen Elizabeth II, whose troubled private life aroused both worldwide sympathy and widespread reprobation, died yesterday morning in London. She was 71.         She suffered a stroke on Friday afternoon, the latest in a series that had left her partly paralyzed in recent months, and developed heart problems overnight, Buckingham Palace said.         The queen announced the death ''with great sadness,'' according to a statement from the palace.         Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is touring West Africa, said he was ''deeply saddened.''         Attractive and fun-loving, Princess Margaret earned a reputation in her youth as a free spirit. But her 20's were clouded by an unlucky romance with Group Capt. Peter Townsend of the Royal Air Force, a Battle of Britain hero with whom she fell in love when he served as an equerry to her father, King George VI.         A Daunting Hurdle: Divorce         In many ways, the group captain  might have made an ideal husband. But the fact that he was divorced raised strong objections from the very establishment the royal family represented. As queen, Margaret's sister, Elizabeth, was the supreme governor of the Church of England, which forbade divorce. Moreover, in the early 1950's, the political storm surrounding Edward VIII's abdication in December 1936 to marry a twice-divorced American, Wallis Warfield Simpson, was a not-so-distant memory.         News media scrutiny was relentless and the pressure intense on Princess Margaret, then third in line to the throne, to break off the relationship. Bowing to the demands of a moral code that a decade later would seem quaint to many people, she chose not to marry him.         In May 1960 she married Anthony Armstrong-Jones, a photographer who was himself the child of divorced parents. Their tempestuous marriage produced two children, but ended in divorce in 1978. The princess did not remarry, but her friendships with men, from prominent people like the actor Peter Sellers to less exalted ones like Roderic Llewellyn, an upper-class drifter 17 years her junior whose main accomplishment appeared to be a talent for gardening, hurt her reputation.         So did the fact that she was often less than gracious when faced with the drudgery of public appearances -- the ribbon-cuttings, diplomatic functions and endless other official occasions by which Britain's royals justify their position and the public money that finances it. Easily bored and often petulant, the princess was known for indulging her moods, which could swing, as Charles Hussey, a British journalist wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1965, from ''a gaiety that was sometimes febrile'' to ''Hanoverian gloom.''         Her extravagant style also prompted outrage. Her wedding cost the British government £25,000 -- then the equivalent of $65,000 -- and her six-week honeymoon on the royal yacht Britannia cost £40,000, or about $115,000. In later years she was criticized for demanding motorcycle escorts and government helicopters to travel around Britain.         Yet admirers spoke warmly of her personal generosity, loyalty to the queen and to her friends, and her irreverent sense of of fun. Louis Armstrong, whose music she loved, once referred to her as ''one hip chick,'' and John Lennon playfully nicknamed her ''Priceless Margarine.''         To many people, Princess Margaret was the black sheep of her generation of royals. But that reputation did not necessarily trouble her. According to a biographer, Theo Aronson, she once told the French poet and filmmaker Jean Cocteau, ''Disobedience is my joy.''         Princess Margaret Rose was born on Aug. 21, 1930, at Glamis, Scotland, the second daughter of the Duke and Duchess of York, six years before her father became King George VI with the abdication of his brother, Edward VIII.         The Family Braved the Blitz         She was educated at home with her sister, the future Queen Elizabeth II.  During World War II, when the king and queen tried to present an image of both stoicism and good cheer to a battered nation, they rejected the suggestion that their two daughters be sent to Canada to be safe from the danger of the blitz. Instead, the two girls remained with their parents, very much in the public eye.         But with Elizabeth clearly being groomed as the next queen, Princess Margaret was often relegated to the background. According to some courtiers, her parents tried to make up for it by indulging her. ''When my sister and I were growing up, she was made out to be the goody-goody one,'' Princess Margaret told Andrew Duncan, author of ''The Reality of Monarchy'' (1970). ''That was boring so the press tried to make out that I was wicked as hell.''         But in threadbare postwar Britain, the press often portrayed her as a glamorous, high-spirited young woman who delighted in trips to Paris and dancing through the night in fashionable London clubs.         After Elizabeth married Prince Philip of Greece in November 1947, Princess Margaret became one of the most eligible single women in the world, and her name was coupled with various fashionable young men.         She first met Group Captain Townsend during the war, when he joined King George's entourage. The group captain's heroism -- he shot down 11 German planes -- was coupled with a low-key style that appealed to the king. Indeed, King George was godfather to one of his two sons by his wife, Rosemary Pawle, whom he married in 1941 and divorced in 1952 on the ground of adultery.         His relationship with the princess grew closer after the king's death in February 1952, but it did not become public until the coronation of Elizabeth II on June 2, 1953, when Margaret, in a gesture of affection that was captured by news photographers, brushed some lint from his uniform.         Princess Margaret was then 22 and Group Captain Townsend 38. He later wrote that their love ''took no heed of wealth and rank and all the other worldly, conventional barriers which separated us.''         But under the Royal Marriages Act, passed in the reign of George III, Princess Margaret could not marry without the sovereign's permission. Under intense media scrutiny, the affair became as politicized as the one involving King Edward and Mrs. Simpson 16 years before. Both Winston Churchill and the queen's private secretary, Sir Alan Lascelles, advised against allowing the marriage. Pressing Group Captain Townsend to end the romance, the British government posted him to the British Embassy in Brussels as air attaché in June 1953. Princess Margaret learned of his posting while she was on a tour of Rhodesia.  After her return, the lovers kept in touch by telephone and managed to see each other secretly.         But the government continued to oppose a marriage, and though Princess Margaret turned 25 in 1955 and was thus free to marry without the queen's consent, it was made plain to her that if she chose to marry Group Captain Townsend she would lose her royal rights and income. In October of that year, the couple met in Britain, discussed their situation, and came to a decision.         ''I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend,'' Princess Margaret announced in a statement. ''Mindful of the church's teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.''         Sympathetic observers later said that if the couple had been permitted to marry, the princess would have settled down to a more conventional life, like her sister. But in his 1978 autobiography, ''Time and Chance,''  Group Captain Townsend wrote, ''I simply hadn't the weight, I knew it, to counterbalance all she would have lost.''         In 1959 the group captain married Marie Luce Jamagne, a 20-year-old Belgian. The next year, on May 6, 1960, Princess Margaret married Mr. Armstrong-Jones, also a commoner, who was given the title Earl of Snowdon.         A photographer who made a successful career out of photographing the rich and famous, Mr. Armstrong-Jones also enjoyed the the Bohemian side of London life. He and the princess helped liven the staid image of the royal family with a touch of the Swinging Sixties.         Garland Was Not Amused         But Princess Margaret's love of fun and informality coexisted with a  sterner side. She insisted that she be addressed as ''Ma'am,'' except for her closest friends, who were permitted to call her ''Ma'am darling.'' As a houseguest she was notoriously demanding. At parties she often objected if other guests ignored royal protocol and left before her. Even her children were expected to refer to her as ''Princess Margaret'' in front of visitors. So did her husband,  though he was said to have called her Ducky in private.         The haughty manner alienated many friends. Mr. Aronson relates in ''Princess Margaret'' (1977) how at a party in Beverly Hills she once told Judy Garland through an intermediary that she would like to hear her sing. Angered by the form of the request, Miss Garland replied, ''Tell her I'll sing if she christens a ship first.''         Although the princess and her husband appeared to have a happy family life, by the late 1960's there were nasty public quarrels. This, coupled with an often ill-concealed irritability at official functions and a love of reveling, brought growing public ridicule.         Increasingly resentful of life in the public eye, Lord Snowdon began to spend more time away from the princess, working abroad on photographic projects, sometimes in the company of attractive young women. Princess Margaret also went her own way. She was linked romantically with Anthony Barton, a friend of her husband, and then had a relationship with Robin Douglas-Home, an aristocrat and former army officer who was the nephew of a former prime minister and played the piano in nightclubs.         In February 1967, when the British press began reporting that the royal couple were about to break up, Lord Snowdon, who was working overseas, and Princess Margaret arranged to meet in New York and fly on to the Bahamas, trying to give the impression that nothing was amiss. Shortly afterward, Princess Margaret wrote to Mr. Douglas-Home breaking off the affair. Eighteen months later he committed suicide.         Although the royal couple had made a show of togetherness and were often photographed with their children -- David Albert Charles Armstrong-Jones (Viscount Linley) and Sarah Frances Elizabeth Armstrong-Jones (Lady Sarah Chatto) -- their relations continued to deteriorate.         At Home on a Caribbean Isle         Princess Margaret was often seen in the company of famous men, including Mr. Sellers. She also began to spend more time on the Caribbean island of Mustique, where a friend, Colin Tenant, had given her land as a wedding present and where she built a vacation home known as Les Jolies-Eaux.         In September 1973, at a luncheon in Edinburgh, she met the 25-year-old  Roderic Llewellyn, who soon became a favorite companion. The son of minor nobility, Mr. Llewellyn had worked briefly at a mine in southern Africa and as an apprentice brewer in England. Five months after meeting Princess Margaret he spent three weeks as her guest in Mustique. Although their relationship was soon an open secret in royal circles. the queen, according to Mr. Aronson, was said to have disapproved of Mr. Llewellyn and what she called ''my sister's guttersnipe life.'' But the liaison remained unknown to the public.         Then in February 1976 a news photographer's picture of the couple together on the island caused a scandal. In March the royal family announced that Lord Snowdon and Princess Margaret were separating.         Meanwhile, the relationship between the princess and Mr. Llewellyn set off a storm in Parliament. When Mr. Llewellyn was hospitalized with stomach problems during a trip to the Caribbean in March 1978, reports that the princess went to his bedside prompted critics to demand that her royal allowance -- then more than $100,000 a year -- be cut. The battle was played out in the newspapers, with some calling for her to end her relationship with Mr. Llewellyn and take her work more seriously, and others writing in her defense.         Although she was patron of more than 80 charities and organizations, colonel in chief of the Highland Fusiliers of Canada and president of the Royal Ballet, there was increasing resentment of her approach to her duties. Critics complained that the number of her public appearances, which had once averaged 150 a year, had dwindled to well below 100. Some Labor members of Parliament called her an embarrassment to the monarchy.         Then in May, while she was hospitalized with hepatitis, Kensington Palace, where she lived, issued a statement announcing her divorce, an action that ended a 400-year-old taboo on divorce in the royal family.         In the fall, Princess Margaret, on an official visit to Tuvalu in the South Pacific, became ill and had to be flown to Sydney, Australia, for treatment. That December, a month after her return to Britain, Lord Snowdon married Lucy Lindsay-Hogg, who had been married to a film director.         Princess Margaret's traumatic private life had long taken a toll on her health. She smoked heavily and her enthusiasm for Scotch sometimes shocked her companions. In 1974, according to Mr. Aronson, she suffered a nervous breakdown.         The princess herself remained reticent about her private life. ''I have no intention of telling people what I have for breakfast,'' she once said.         Sometimes, however, she had a penchant for saying the wrong thing. In October 1979, six weeks after Earl Mountbatten was killed by Irish Republican Army terrorists, she angered many Irish-Americans while on a visit to Chicago, reportedly declaring in the presence of Mayor Jane Byrne that the Irish were ''pigs.''         But she could also be quite gracious. In 1980, when Mr. Llewellyn told her that he was breaking off their relationship to marry Tatiania Soskin, a fashion designer, she assured the younger couple she would be happy to attend their wedding, and she remained friends with both.         Lunch With an Old Lover         As the 1980's progressed, public interest turned to the romantic travails of the next generation of royals. Two of the queen's three sons -- Charles, the Prince of Wales, and Andrew, the Duke of York -- married and divorced under the glare of relentless publicity. Anne, the princess royal and the queen's only daughter, was permitted to divorce her husband, Capt. Mark Philips, and in 1992 married a royal equerry.         Through the years the princess  had corresponded with Peter Townsend and in 1992, while he was on a rare visit to Britain, she invited him to lunch at Kensington Palace attended by several other people. The 77-year-old group captain and the 61-year-old princess sat and ''chatted like the old friends they were.'' Group Captain Townsend died in Paris in 1995.         It was often speculated how different her life might have been had the two been allowed to marry.         ''In my opinion, this was the turning point to disaster for the royal family,'' said Harold Brooks-Baker, publishing director of Burke's Peerage, at the time of Group Captain  Townsend's death. ''After Princess Margaret was denied marriage, it backfired and more or less ruined Margaret's life. The queen decided that from then on, anyone someone in her family wanted to marry would be more or less acceptable. The royal family and the public now feel that they've gone too far in the other direction.''         Princess Margaret is survived by her son, Lord Linley, her daughter, Lady Sarah, and three grandchildren.         As she grew older, the princess  lived less in the public eye. ''They leave me alone these days,'' Mr. Aronson quoted her as saying. ''Today they have other fish to fry.''         Correction:  February 15, 2002, Friday  Because of an editing error, a television review on Feb. 4 about ''Bertie and Elizabeth,'' a ''Masterpiece Theater'' presentation on the life of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, misstated the policy of the Church of England on divorce, a factor in the abdication of her brother-in-law King Edward VIII, who became the Duke of Windsor. An obituary of her daughter Princess Margaret on Sunday also included the error. The church does not forbid divorce. It revokes the right to marry in a parish church while a former spouse is living. But even then, depending on circumstances, a priest can allow a church wedding.       
         Elisabeth Mann Borgese, a multifaceted writer, defender of marine resources and founder of the International Oceans Institute based in Malta, died on Feb. 8 while on vacation in St. Moritz, Switzerland. She was 83 and lived in Halifax, Nova Scotia.         Professor Borgese was the last surviving child of Thomas Mann. She was a pianist by training, a multilingual political scientist and a writer of fiction and of oceanic yearbooks.         She helped organize the international Peace in the Oceans Conference of 1970, the first of 30 such meetings worldwide. She was an enduring presence at those gatherings, which brought about the United Nations Law of the Seas treaty in 1982.         Elisabeth Mann was born in Munich, the second youngest of three girls and three boys of Thomas and Katia Pringsheim Mann. (W. H. Auden became her brother-in-law when the poet married her sister Erika to provide her with a British passport.)         Hoping to become a musician, Elisabeth studied the piano and cello, receiving a diploma from the Conservatory of Music in Zurich in 1938.         The Mann family had left Germany after Hitler came to power, moving first to Switzerland and, in 1938, to the United States. In 1939, Elisabeth married Giuseppe A. Borgese, a professor 36 years her senior who had fled Fascist Italy; he died in 1952.         She became a United States citizen in 1941 but took Canadian citizenship in 1983. She worked as an editor and researcher in Chicago, including two years as executive secretary of the board of the Encyclopedia Britannica in the mid-1960's.         She served as a senior fellow at the Center for the Study of Democratic Institutions in Santa Barbara, Calif., before joining the faculty at Dalhousie University in Halifax in 1979, first as a political science professor and later as an adjunct law professor.         In the 1970's, Professor Borgese formed the International Oceans Institute, which has since grown to 20 centers.         She is survived by two daughters, Angelica Borgese of Manhattan and Turkey, and Dr. Domenica Borgese of Milan; a son, Marcel Deschamps of Halifax; three grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Ani Pachen, celebrated as the warrior nun who led her Tibetan clan in armed rebellion against the Chinese invaders until she was captured and spent 21 years as a prisoner, died on Feb. 2 in her home in exile in Dharmsala, India. She was 68 or 69.         John Hocevar, executive director of Students for a Free Tibet, said she became ill with what were thought to be stomach problems, and her heart failed. He explained that she, like many Tibetans of her generation, did not know her specific birthday. She was born in 1933.         She was given the name Pachen Dolma at birth, but became known as Ani Pachen after becoming a Buddhist nun.         Her name translates roughly as Nun Big Courage.         Its aptness was suggested by her leading 600 resistance fighters on horseback against the tanks of the invading Chinese Communists,  prompting some admirers to caller her Tibet's Joan of Arc. In prison she withstood being beaten and hung by her wrists for a week and spending a year in leg irons.         ''I felt terrible for those who imprisoned me,'' she said, and also expressed sorrow for the captors who tortured her, saying she held the Buddhist belief that their cruelties resulted from karma from their past lives.         Pachen Dolma was the only child of a local chieftain from Gonjo in the province of Kham in eastern Tibet. She grew up surrounded by lamas and a loving family, said William Edelglass, a professor of philosophy who specializes on Tibet at Emory University. She learned to ride and shoot, even as she was drawn toward a spiritual life.         At the age of 17, she overheard talk of plans for an arranged marriage to the chieftain of another clan. She fled to a distant monastery and became a Buddhist nun. When her family relented on the marriage plans, she returned home and divided her time between learning from her father how to be a chieftain and religious studies.         The Chinese, who had invaded in 1950, were desecrating monasteries and killing Tibetans as they steadily advanced toward Kham. In 1958, Ani Pachen sat at her father's side in the war councils as the clan decided to fight back.         Later that year, her father fell ill and died. She reluctantly decided her Buddhist pacifism must give way to warfare as the only way to save the religion in Tibet.         When Gonjo was overrun, she fled to the hills with her family and led the fighting. Her troops ambushed Chinese convoys and destroyed their camps, but were gradually defeated. In 1960, she was captured while trying to flee on foot over the Himalayas with her mother, aunt and aged grandmother. She was 25 when she began her 21-year imprisonment.         ''When they arrested me they bound my hands and feet and hung me upside down and interrogated me,'' she said in a speech reported in the Buddhist magazine Shambhala Sun. ''They beat me continuously. I would pass out and they would throw water on me and beat me some more. They shackled me for a year. They put me in a hole in the ground and forced me to live in my own feces.''         She told her story in an autobiography, ''Sorrow Mountain: The Remarkable Story of a Tibetan Warrior Nun,'' written with Adelaide Donnelly (Doubleday, 2000). Richard Gere, the actor and a Buddhist, helped get the book printed and wrote a preface.         ''Rarely has the injustice of Chinese occupation been so movingly, or graphically exposed,'' said a review in The Sunday Times of London.         Ani Pachen told how she was so hungry that she would rejoice when she found a worm in the soil. She said her Buddhist faith kept her alive: for instance, she was determined to complete 100,000 ritual prostrations during nine months of solitary confinement.         Ani Pachen was released from prison in January 1981. Instead of returning home, she remained in Lhasa and took part in several large demonstrations. Tipped off in 1988 that she was at risk for rearrest, she fled for the border. She settled in Dharmsala, joining other supporters of the exiled Dalai Lama, whom she had long dreamed of meeting. Her mother, aunt and grandmother had died. She left no survivors.         Ani Pachen traveled the world to speak for the Tibetan cause. For all her apparent equanimity, she acknowledged resentment over losing her youth in prison.         ''I have not reached enlightenment -- the absence of negative feelings,'' she wrote. ''I want to have full compassion, but I spent half my life in prison and I still have some anger.''       
         Theresa Castro, who with her husband, Bernard, made Castro virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in New York and Florida, died on Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 85.         Her daughter, Bernadette Castro, the New York State parks commissioner, said she died at North Shore University Hospital. She lived in Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Castro used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the Castro Convertible Corporation. At first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. When Bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage.         As the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in New York and Florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations.         Success was measured by the innumerable Castro convertibles in apartments and houses. It was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in Lloyd Harbor, on Long Island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in Ocala, Fla.; a house in Fort Lauderdale; an apartment in Manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht.         But Mrs. Castro retained a homey style. After founding a country club in Marion County, Florida, she started a golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. Her lasagna was legendary.         Her biggest success was surely her idea of using Bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas. The commercial -- shown 40,000 times in various forms -- was one of the first local advertisements to run on New York television and was said to be the first to feature a child.         Mrs. Castro was born Theresa Barabas on a dairy farm outside McKeesport, Pa., on Feb. 15, 1917. Her father was Hungarian and her mother Austrian. At the age of 13, Theresa entered a convent to fulfill a promise her mother had made to an order of nuns. She eventually left, promising her mother that she would ''do more good from outside the cloistered walls.''         As a child, the second of 14 children, she lived in poverty, sharing a bedroom with six siblings; she never spoke of ''the good old days,'' her daughter said. When she moved to New York at 17, she saw her first movie and met Mr. Castro, her ''dream man.'' They were married on Valentine's Day 1942.         Mr. Castro died in 1991. Their son, Bernard Jr., died after he was shot in his home in Fort Lauderdale in 1974. In addition to Bernadette, who lives in Lloyd Harbor, Mrs. Castro is survived by three brothers, Andrew Barabas, of Danbury, Conn., John Barabas, of Ocala, and Steve Barabas, of northern Florida. She is also survived by four sisters, Betty Bassett of Danbury, Barbara Castro of northern Florida, Julie Miller of Danbury and Mary Vitale of Connecticut and Florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         Her many charitable interests included the Golden Hills Academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. She helped found an interfaith chapel at the Florida School for the Deaf in St. Augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986.         Her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to Krause's Furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. One idea was the Ready Lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. Another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. It was called the Scotch and Sofa.         Correction:  March 15, 2002, Friday  An obituary on March 6 about Theresa Castro, who with her husband established the company that makes Castro Convertible sofas, omitted some survivors. Mrs. Castro had six grandchildren, not four, and seven great-grandchildren, not five.       
         Eda J. LeShan, a psychologist and family counselor who brought psychoanalytic insights and common sense to two dozen books meant to guide people through life's challenges, died on March 2 at her home in Riverdale, the Bronx. She was 79.         The cause was kidney failure, said a nephew, Bruce LeShan.         Ms. LeShan was known for the motherly warmth she brought to books like ''The Conspiracy Against Childhood'' (Atheneum, 1967), her best-known work on raising children; her radio commentaries on CBS; and her show on PBS, ''How Do Your Children Grow?''         Her message to harried parents was to ease off on the pressure, and sometimes allow children to just daydream. She thought that the discussion of love was central to sex education, and that spanking could only make the child feel as bad as the angry parent.         She said every parent should have a sampler on the wall that says, ''I'm only human.'' Raising a child, she said, is like gardening, because each flower develops differently.         A reviewer in Publishers Weekly in 1978 wrote, ''Adults and young people have benefited from LeShan's fluent, sympathetic writing in books addressed to those in trouble.''         Eda Joan Grossman was born in Manhattan on June 6, 1922. Her mother, Jean Schick Grossman, was a parent educator, and her father, Max Grossman, was a lawyer and president of the Ethical Culture Society of New York.         She graduated from the Fieldston School in Riverdale, and received a degree in early childhood education from Teachers College at Columbia University. She earned a master's degree in child psychology from Clark University in Worcester, Mass.         Her life amounted to personal testimony to her message that people could continue to grow throughout their lives.         She wrote her first book when she was 43, began to appear regularly on a television show when she was 46 and got her own program on educational television when she was 48.         In addition to her books, which have been translated into nine languages, and her television and radio shows, she wrote a regular column for Newsday for years and was a contributing editor of Parents magazine. Her articles appeared in many magazines, including The New York Times Magazine in the 1960's. For nine years, she wrote the ''Talking It Over'' column for Woman's Day.         As she aged, she wrote more about older people. Her books include ''The Wonderful Crisis of Middle Age: Some Personal Reflections'' (McKay, 1973), ''Oh, to Be Fifty Again!'' (Random House, 1986) and ''Grandparents: A Special Kind of Love'' (Macmillan, 1984).         ''I used to be a child psychologist and I love children and I kind of miss that part of my life,'' she said in an interview on ''CBS This Morning'' in 1990. ''But I try to write the same way when I'm writing for older people, where I share my vulnerabilities and my aches and pains and my mood swings and so forth.''         She wrote a play in her 70's. It was called ''The Lobster Reef,'' in reference to the vulnerability lobsters experience when they shed their shells and are completely naked until they grow a new one. It told the story of a woman battling to rid herself of literal and figurative cancers.         When the one-woman play opened in 1995 on Ms. LeShan's 73rd birthday, Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The Times that it was ''a striking creation'' that brought to life four generations. He wrote that it would be interesting to see what she could do if she put more than one character on stage.         She is survived by her husband, Lawrence LeShan, and their daughter, Wendy, who also lives in Riverdale.       
         Rosetta LeNoire, a theatrical producer and a pioneer of nontraditional casting who also played the sweet, all-knowing Mother Winslow on the television show ''Family Matters,'' died on Sunday in Teaneck, N.J. She was 90.         She lived at the Actors' Fund Nursing and Retirement Home in Englewood, N.J., after spending most of her life in the Bronx, said Donna Trinkoff, producing director of the Amas Musical Theater. Miss LeNoire founded Amas, a nonprofit theater group, in 1968, partly to promote interracial casting. The company produced hits including ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.''         Miss LeNoire's life coincided with glittering moments in show business. Her godfather was Bill Robinson, the tap dancer known as Bojangles, and her music teacher was the jazz pianist and composer Eubie Blake. She was directed by Orson Welles in his all-black version of ''Macbeth'' in the 1930's.         She acted in some of the earliest television shows, and once joked that she seemed to play every maid's role on Broadway.         Perhaps as a result, she was an early and effective advocate of expanding opportunities for minority performers to act in plays and musicals. In 1989, her friend Colleen Dewhurst, who was then president of Actors' Equity, chose Miss LeNoire as the first recipient of what became the union's annual award for broadening participation in theater. The award was named for her.         ''Rosetta created nontraditional casting before the phrase itself was created,'' The New York Beacon, a newspaper with a largely black readership, said in 1997.         In 1999, President Clinton lauded her long fight against discrimination as he presented her with the National Medal of the Arts, one of her many honors.         ''Rosetta did more than dream of a theater with no color bar -- she actually built one,'' he said.         Miss LeNoire, whose name was originally Rosetta Burton, was born in 1911 in the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan. Her paternal grandfather played the organ for five churches in the West Indies, and her father was one of the first black plumbers and electricians licensed by New York State.         When she was a child, her mother died of pneumonia at the age of 27 after giving birth to her brother in a Harlem hospital corridor because segregated policies barred her from a room. Rosetta was crippled with rickets, a result of vitamin deprivation, and when she was 7 doctors broke her legs so the bones could grow properly.         Mr. Robinson, a member of the Elks Club with her father, volunteered to become godfather of the girl he called Brown Sugar. At 13, when her leg braces came off, she began music lessons with Mr. Blake, who told her to ''look up and be proud of yourself.'' When she was 15, she became a chorus girl with the Time Steppers, Mr. Robinson's troupe.         A marriage to an elevator operator ended in divorce. She then married Egbert Brown, who owned a fleet of cabs; he died after 26 years of marriage.         She is survived by her son, William, of Manahawkin, N.J.; her sister, Mary A. Francis of Palm Coast, Fla.; her brothers, Wilmote Burton of the Bronx, and Warren Burton of Palm Coast; two grandchildren; and two great-grandchildren.         Study at a government-sponsored Works Progress Administration program at a theater on the Lower East Side led to a role in the all-black version of ''Macbeth,'' which Orson Welles was producing in Harlem. She toured with the production.         ''Good lord! He was a delegate from heaven,'' she said of Mr. Welles. ''He was the only one who had faith that blacks could bring the right dignity and sophistication to Shakespeare.''         Later she joined the Robert Earl Jones Theater Group. In addition to acting, she cared for Mr. Jones's infant son, James Earl Jones.         She made her Broadway debut in 1939 in ''The Hot Mikado,'' an all-black version of the operetta.         ''It was something,'' she said. ''There were 125 of us, all black Japanese.''         Her other theater credits include ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' ''The Sunshine Boys,'' ''Lost in the Stars,'' ''Cabin in the Sky'' and ''Sophie.'' She played the role of Stella in ''Anna Lucasta'' in 1944, toured with the show and starred in the 1958 film version, with Sammy Davis Jr. and Eartha Kitt. Her other movie credits include ''Moscow on the Hudson,'' Playing for Keeps'' and ''Brewster's Millions.''         She worked in television during its experimental days, and later appeared in ''Search for Tomorrow,'' ''The Guiding Light,'' ''Amen'' and ''A World Apart. She played Nell Carter's mother, Mama, on NBC's ''Gimme a Break'' and was Mother Winslow on ABC's ''Family Matters'' for eight years.         Eight years after founding Amas, she added a children's theatrical course to its program. (Amas is a form of the verb ''to love'' in Latin.) The company's hits included ''Bojangles'' and ''Bubbling Brown Sugar,'' a Tony nominee in 1976.         ''I produce musicals,'' she said. ''Music is one avenue where no one seems to have any discriminatory attitudes.''       
         Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, the enduringly popular grande dame of the British royal family and the country's most beloved symbol of courage and self-sacrifice during World War II, died in her sleep this afternoon at the Royal Lodge at Windsor Palace, a spokesman for her daughter, Queen Elizabeth II, announced. She was 101.         In a life longer than the 20th century, the queen mother presided over a period of turbulence and change in Britain, helping to sustain the monarchy through the most serious crises to befall it in modern times.         In 1936, when her painfully diffident husband was crowned King George VI after the abdication of his older brother, she became the strength behind the throne, helping transform him from a stammering, insecure second son into a loved and respected monarch.         As queen during World War II, her decision to remain in London through the worst days of the blitz proved a rallying point for Britons desperate for the sort of leadership that only a monarch could provide. And when Buckingham Palace was bombed, she forever endeared herself to the nation by declaring herself in solidarity with the working-class people of London's bomb-ravaged East End.         ''I am almost glad we have been bombed,'' she said, in what became one of the war's most memorable remarks. ''Now I feel I can look the East End in the face.''         Many years later, through the traumas of the divorce and then the death of Diana, the Princess of Wales, her granddaughter-in-law, the queen mother proved to be the royal family's most resiliently popular member, providing the country with a rock-steady reason for remaining a monarchy. News of her death today dealt a blow to Britons accustomed to her enduring presence. [Page 16.]         When King George died in 1952, she was thrust at the age of 51 into what would be the longest role of her life: that of the queen mother, necessarily taking a back seat to her daughter, Queen Elizabeth. But in the eyes of a country that never lost its abiding affection for its good-natured ''Queen Mum,'' it was a role she fulfilled with grace, carrying out a grueling schedule of public engagements well into her 90's and never losing her common touch, which included a healthy appetite for a glass or two of gin and a love of horse racing and trout fishing.         ''She is the nation's favorite great-grandmother, seemingly known intimately to all of us for years,'' The Times of London declared in 1985, on the occasion of the queen mother's 85th birthday (she celebrated it by flying on the Concorde). ''She has helped make the royal family more secure in the nation's affections than it has been at any other time in history.''         Ben Pimlott, the historian and royal biographer, wrote in 1997 that the queen mother was ''the last survivor of the tiny club of center-stage actors of the Second World War.'' He continued: ''She has also shown a chameleon-like ability to adapt to shifting conditions, something her deeply conservative nature makes the more remarkable. Unlike most public figures, she does not date. She has never made an intellectual remark in her life. Her knack has been to look for the best in people and offer a kind of looking glass to the virtues they would like to have.''         Father Was an Eccentric         Elizabeth Angela Marguerite Bowes-Lyon was born in London on Aug. 4, 1900, in the waning days of the reign of Queen Victoria, a golden time for the British monarchy and its empire. She was the fourth daughter and ninth child of Lord Glamis, a Scottish nobleman whose family occupied Glamis Castle in Scotland, said to be the place where Macbeth murdered Duncan in Shakespeare's play. When his father died four years later, Lord Glamis inherited a considerable fortune and an even more impressive title, becoming the 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Viscount Lyon and Baron Glamis.         Lord Strathmore was a bona fide aristocratic eccentric. He had a deep mistrust of eggs (''Poison, my dear, poison,'' he would intone ominously at the breakfast table) and a habit of dragging dead branches from his woods in the middle of the night. Dressed in an old raincoat tied with string, he would then split them into logs for the fire.         Raised partly at Glamis and partly in the fashionable Knightsbridge section of London, the young Lady Elizabeth was by all accounts sunny almost to a fault. Her favorite hobby, she once wrote in an autograph album, was ''making friends.''         Indifferently educated by governesses, Elizabeth spent much of her youth doing what young aristocratic women generally did at the time: learning arts like household management and enjoying herself. The real world intruded during World War I, though, when her brothers went off to fight and Glamis was turned for four years into a convalescent home for soldiers. Wanting to protect her mother from bad news, Elizabeth made sure to waylay the mailman every morning so that she could read the mail first. In fact, there was bad news: one of Elizabeth's brothers was killed, sending Lady Strathmore into a depression from which she never really recovered.         When the war was over, Elizabeth's social life, essentially an extended search for a husband in the guise of a series of amusing diversions, began in earnest. Her biographers tend to agree that she was a great success as a debutante, flirting wildly and constantly fending off a large coterie of broken-hearted suitors, one of whom reportedly -- and unromantically -- serenaded her by cracking his hunting whip under her bedroom window at night.         Elizabeth and Bertie         Although history is hazy on facts, several biographers say there was one suitor whom Elizabeth was genuinely in love with: Maj. James Stuart, the equerry to Prince Albert Frederick Arthur George, the Duke of York and King George V's second son. But if there was a romance there, it never went anywhere. Albert began courting Elizabeth himself, and Major Stuart ended up being summarily shipped off to work on an oil rig in Oklahoma. The day before Elizabeth's wedding, he announced his own engagement to one of her friends.         The romance between Elizabeth and Bertie, as the prince was known, apparently did not begin promisingly. Bullied by his parents and overshadowed by his handsome and charming older brother, David, the Prince of Wales, Bertie suffered from delicate health, crippling shyness, an array of nervous tics, a terrible stutter, an unpredictable temper, a tendency to melancholy and what today would be described as a serious case of low self-esteem. When he asked his parents' permission to pursue Elizabeth, his father murmured, ''You'll be a lucky fellow if she accepts you.''         Elizabeth did resist Bertie's attentions for several years, finally accepting his proposal in 1923 and thus agreeing to become the first commoner (anyone below the rank of peer or peeress) to marry so close to the throne since the 17th century. It was when her engagement was announced that Lady Elizabeth had her first and only on-the-record conversation with a reporter. The interview was harmless enough -- ''I play golf, badly, and I am fond of lawn tennis,'' she confided -- but she was roundly rebuked by the king, and never gave another interview.         The wedding was a national extravaganza, but afterward Elizabeth, now the Duchess of York, settled in relatively modest circumstances, at least by royal standards. Though the house she shared with Bertie at 145 Piccadilly, London, had 25 bedrooms and 21 servants, it was hardly a palace, and it opened onto a communal garden at the back. They had two children, Elizabeth, known as Lilibet, and Margaret Rose, and the Duchess settled into a pleasant life of regal domesticity, saying her main duty was ''bringing up her children.''         Another duty was bucking up the flagging spirits of her husband, who hated the spotlight but who was required to make many public appearances, particularly as his father's health waned and his older brother proved more interested in a racy social life than in boring regal duties. But while in many ways the personalities of the Yorks could not have been more different -- she was ebullient where he was glum, relaxed where he was awkward, garrulous where he was laconic -- they were surprisingly well suited.         Among other things, Elizabeth forced Bertie to seek treatment for what was delicately referred to as his ''affliction,'' and the two visited a Harley Street doctor nearly every day for some two and a half months, as Bertie learned to keep his stutter in check. The marriage proved to be just what the future king needed, Bertie's official biographer, Sir John Wheeler-Bennett, would later write. ''It brought him much for which he had long craved in deprivation -- love, understanding, sympathy, support,'' he said. ''All these things were now his in generous abundance, and his whole conspectus of life changed accordingly.''         Edward and Mrs. Simpson         The coziness of their early years was abruptly shattered in 1936, when King Edward VIII, as Bertie's older brother styled himself on ascending the throne, announced that he had fallen inconveniently in love with the very married Wallis Simpson, an American whose earlier divorce from her first husband had already ruled her out as a possible royal bride.         Not even the exhortations of his most trusted advisers, or the frightened tears of his younger brother, would make Edward give up Mrs. Simpson, and on Dec. 10, 1936, he abdicated and left for France. Mrs. Simpson got a divorce in 1937, and the two eventually married, adopted a flotilla of small dogs, and spent the rest of their lives in glamorous if bitter exile as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor.         The terrified Bertie was left behind to comfort a shocked nation and to try to rise to the occasion. ''Dickie, this is absolutely terrible,'' he told his friend and cousin Lord Mountbatten. ''I'm quite unprepared for it. David has been trained for this all his life. I've never even seen a state paper.'' It was clear, even then, how much he depended on Elizabeth. ''With my wife and helpmeet by my side, I take up the heavy burden which lies before me,'' he said on his first day as king.         Elizabeth may have seemed complaisant and sweet, but she had a ''steel hand within a velvet glove,'' in the words of Lord Halifax, the foreign secretary, and she never forgave David or Wallis Simpson for throwing her husband to the wolves. ''She can forgive any act but treachery, and then she is implacable as any Scot,'' wrote Dorothy Laird, one of Elizabeth's biographers. ''The wound goes very deep.'' Most of her anger, it seems, was directed against the duchess.         Bertie himself was so unnerved that he never mentioned Wallis's name, referring to her in his diary as ''Mrs. S.,'' but the queen certainly had a hand in ensuring that she and her brother-in-law had as rough a time as possible. On the eve of their wedding and in a move that foreshadowed the battle over a post-divorce title for Diana, the Princess of Wales, more than 50 years later, the couple were informed that while the duke would continue to be styled ''royal highness,'' the duchess would not. The wedding was a tiny, fraught affair, with only 12 guests, none from David's family.         Acutely sensitive to what they saw as the duke's efforts to set up an unofficial rival court, the king and queen continually thwarted David's efforts to return home with Wallis. It was not until 30 years later, with Bertie long dead, that Elizabeth was to come face to face again with her hated sister-in-law, whom she always called in private ''the woman who killed my husband.'' (Wallis was not particularly fond of her, either, referring to her as ''Cookie'' in a disparaging reference to her plumpness.)         The crisis having been weathered, the new king and queen set out to remove some of the stuffiness from royal life, dispensing, for instance, with the custom of requiring the king's daughters to curtsy to him. But they would soon find other matters preoccupying them, as the country became consumed with the specter of impending war. The king tried valiantly, if ineffectually, to do his part for diplomacy, preparing a personal letter to Hitler in 1938 that appealed to him ''as one ex-serviceman to another'' and begged him to spare the world from another war. (In the end, the prime minister, Neville Chamberlain, sternly if gently forbade the King to send the letter.)         The King and the President         Early in 1939, Elizabeth and Bertie traveled to Hyde Park, N.Y., to visit Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt, the president and first lady of the United States. The trip, in which they had their first taste of hot dogs, cemented a friendship that was to prove helpful in obtaining American support for the war effort later. In her memoirs, Mrs. Roosevelt described the easy banter between the king and the president.         ''My mother does not approve of cocktails and thinks you should have a cup of tea,'' Roosevelt said. ''Neither does my mother,'' the king replied. Then they both had cocktails.         War broke out in August, when Hitler invaded Poland, and Elizabeth was formally advised by the British cabinet to take her daughters to Canada until the danger was past. She refused to go, stoutly declaring that ''the princesses would never leave without me, and I wouldn't leave without the king, and the king will never leave.'' Instead, she remained in London, enthusiastically taking target practice at the palace with a revolver that was a gift from the new prime minister, Winston Churchill.         The royal family's role in wartime was a largely ceremonial one -- visiting Red Cross centers, civil defense installations, air-raid shelters, hospitals and munition factories; comforting the wounded, and boosting the morale of soldier and civilian alike --but the importance of such ceremony at such a time cannot be overstated.         ''Your majesty, don't you know what you mean to all of us in this country?'' the minister of food at the time, Lord Woolton, once said to Elizabeth. ''It isn't only your high position that matters; it is the fact that the vast majority of people think of you as a person who would speak the kindly word, and, if it fell within your power, would take the cup of hot soup to the needy person.''         Though the king made secret visits to the troops and Elizabeth made a point of visiting places that had been bombed, invariably wearing a smart dress and pearls, they were relatively unaffected personally until Sept. 13, 1940. That day, as the royal couple sat in one of their living rooms at Buckingham Palace, the palace was struck by half a dozen German bombs, which damaged its courtyard and destroyed its chapel. Although they were able to take refuge in an unusually upscale bomb shelter, prepared by the queen with handsome furniture and a supply of fashion magazines, it was then that the queen made her enduring remark about being able ''to look the East End in the eye.''         In a biography of Elizabeth, the royal writer Anthony Holden called it ''a phrase which will reverberate through the history of the British monarchy's relations with its people.'' He continued, ''Never before, or indeed since, had such a strength of fellow-feeling been so genuine and so widely shared.''         A Spartan Windsor Castle         The queen also made it clear that she was determined to adhere to strict rules of wartime economy. Although the royal family's life was naturally easier than that of most of her countrymen, it was still rigorously ascetic. Windsor Castle, where Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret were to spend the next five years, had no heat except for the occasional space heater, and just one bare bulb for each room.         When Mrs. Roosevelt visited Buckingham Palace in 1942, she found a bathtub painted with a black line above which water was not supposed to rise; food that was close to inedible (and severely rationed) and rooms that were so cold that the women wore fur coats and blankets indoors.         Not even Churchill escaped. Accustomed to eating meager sandwiches served by the queen during his weekly luncheon meetings with the king, he found on one occasion that the food was even more horrific than usual. ''I don't know what is in these sandwiches,'' the king told the prime minister. ''Sawdust, I suppose.''         The king's always fragile health was not improved by the stresses of the war or by his lifelong smoking habit, and after victory was declared in 1945, he began the long, slow decline that would result in his death, from lung cancer, in 1952. With the death of her husband, Elizabeth had to face the fact that she was no longer on center stage, would have to leave Buckingham Palace, and would, if protocol was strictly followed, have to curtsy to her own daughter, Queen Elizabeth. Riven with grief, she wrote to President Eisenhower that ''one cannot imagine life without him, but one must carry on as he would have wished.''         In the past, widowed mothers of monarchs were known as queen dowagers, but Elizabeth rejected that title in favor of the more impressive one she held to her death: Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. As queen mother, she lost neither her formidability nor her ability to influence. The new queen was just 25 when she ascended the throne, and relied heavily on the advice of her mother. The operators at Clarence House, which became the queen mother's official residence, soon became used to putting through her daughter's daily telephone call: ''Your majesty?'' they would say, ''I have her majesty on the line, your majesty.''         Another Divorce Crisis         Soon afterward, another crisis befell the monarchy when Princess Margaret, the queen mother's younger daughter, fell in love with a divorced man, Peter Townsend, a hero of the Battle of Britain. It is unclear what role her mother played in the queen's decision to inform Margaret that she would have to give up her royal status and leave the country if she married Mr. Townsend, but the lessons of Edward's abdication were surely not lost to her now. The princess gave up her beau, married the photographer Anthony Armstrong-Jones five years later, and ended up divorcing him 15 years after that. Margaret died on Feb. 9, predeceasing her mother by less than two months.         Bolstered by a large staff, a number of houses at her disposal, and an allowance of more than $1 million a year from Parliament, the queen mother kept up a busy schedule that began to ease up only when she was in her 80's. She served as either president or patron of 312 British organizations, ranging, as one biographer put it, ''from the Royal Agricultural Society to the Dachshund Club.'' As a link to the past, a symbol of continuity, and, to many, a potent reminder of Britain's finest hour, the she remained a familiar figure even in her late 90's, in her cheerful, brightly colored dresses, large flowery hats and ready smile.         Her health problems over the years always became a cause for concern in a country that simply did not want her to die. She had two hip-replacement operations in her late 90's, which invariably ended with her hobbling slowly out of the hospital while crowds of well-wishers cheered. What the public did not learn, until it was finally reported by the news media much later, was that she underwent a colostomy in 1966 and had to wear a bag to collect her wastes for the rest of her life.         In recent years, there were niggling criticisms of the queen mother: that she was a bon vivant who spent far beyond her means; that she kept too many houses and employed too many servants and generally thought too much of her own comfort. But such sniping was relatively muted.         She remained popular because, in a very different and much more real way than Diana had been, she was a monarch who never lost the common touch. Nor did she lose her rather sly, flirtatious smile, her beguiling manner (''I work awfully hard, but Mummy has all the charm,'' her daughter Elizabeth once said) or her easy way with the public.         Reveling in meeting and chatting to new people (''If we do not pass on, I shall soon pass out,'' her husband once said as Elizabeth persisted in chatting at a public appearance), she was also eternally tactful and diplomatic. At a luncheon on a trip to South Africa, she once listened patiently as an irate Afrikaaner mayor complained about the indignities his countrymen had suffered at the hands of the English. ''Oh, I do understand so well,'' Elizabeth responded. ''That's just how we feel about them in Scotland.''         And once, after touring a garden in London, she stayed on for tea. ''I hear you like gin?'' her hostess blurted out, instantly afraid of appearing tactless. But the queen mother thought it delightful.         ''I hadn't realized I enjoyed that reputation,'' she replied. ''But as I do, perhaps you could make it a large one.''         Correction:  April 1, 2002, Monday  An obituary of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother yesterday misstated the name of the royal estate where she died. It is Windsor Castle, not Windsor Palace.         Correction:  April 3, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary of Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother on Sunday misstated the date of Hitler's invasion of Poland in 1939, which prompted the cabinet to suggest that she take her daughters to Canada. It was Sept. 1, not in August.       
         Theresa Castro, who with her husband, Bernard, made Castro virtually a synonym for convertible sofa and who was an energetic charitable benefactor in New York and Florida, died on Sunday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 85.         Her daughter, Bernadette Castro, the New York State parks commissioner, said she died at North Shore University Hospital. She lived in Lloyd Harbor, N.Y.         Mrs. Castro used tips from her job as a waitress to provide some of the initial capital for what became the Castro Convertible Corporation. At first, she did everything from answering the phone to stuffing mattresses. When Bernadette was a baby, she took her to the store and put her behind a screen in a carriage.         As the corporation grew, she became executive vice president and treasurer of the four companies it comprised. She worked 12 to 14 hours a day and kept four secretaries busy in New York and Florida, the family's second home, where the company had moved its manufacturing operations.         Success was measured by the innumerable Castro convertibles in apartments and houses. It was also evident in the couple's 25-room, 13-bath mansion in Lloyd Harbor, on Long Island; their 5,000-acre cattle ranch in Ocala, Fla.; a house in Fort Lauderdale; an apartment in Manhattan; and a 93-foot yacht.         But Mrs. Castro retained a homey style. After founding a country club in Marion County, Florida, she started a  golf tournament there, and pitched in to cook at the annual awards banquets. Her lasagna was legendary.         Her biggest success was surely her idea of using Bernadette, starting at the age of 4, wearing a white nightgown and sausage curls, in television commercials for the sofas. The commercial -- shown 40,000 times in various forms -- was one of the first local advertisements to run on New York television and was said to be the first to feature a child.         Mrs. Castro was born Theresa Barabas on a dairy farm outside McKeesport, Pa., on Feb. 15, 1917. Her father was Hungarian and her mother Austrian. At the age of 13, Theresa entered a convent to fulfill a promise her mother had made to an order of nuns. She eventually left, promising her mother that she would ''do more good from outside the cloistered walls.''         As a child, the second of 14 children, she lived in poverty, sharing a bedroom with six siblings; she never spoke of ''the good old days,'' her daughter said. When she moved to New York at 17, she saw her first movie and met Mr. Castro, her ''dream man.'' They were married on Valentine's Day 1942.         Mr. Castro died in 1991. Their son, Bernard Jr., died after he was shot in his home in Fort Lauderdale in 1974. In addition to Bernadette, who lives in Lloyd Harbor, Mrs. Castro is survived by three brothers, Andrew Barabas, of Danbury, Conn., John Barabas, of Ocala, and Steve Barabas, of northern Florida. She is also survived by four sisters, Betty Bassett of Danbury, Barbara Castro of northern Florida, Julie Miller of Danbury and Mary Vitale of Connecticut and Florida; four grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         Her many charitable interests included the Golden Hills Academy, which she started in part so that her son, who had dyslexia, could get a proper education. She helped found an interfaith chapel at the Florida School for the Deaf in St. Augustine; it was renamed in her honor in 1986.         Her contributions to the convertible business, which was sold to Krause's Furniture in 1993, were usually anonymous. One idea was the Ready Lady, a piece of furniture that concealed not only a hair dryer but also an iron and ironing board. Another had a hi-fi built into one end, a bar in the other. It was called the Scotch and Sofa.       
         Linda Boreman, the woman once known as Linda Lovelace, who starred in one of the first feature-length pornography movies, ''Deep Throat,'' and who later denounced it as depicting her ''rape,'' died on Monday in Denver. She was 53.         The cause was injuries from a car accident on April 3, her family said.         The 62-minute film, released in 1972, made money so fast that its producers joked they had to weigh their receipts each day; by many estimates it earned more than $600 million. It cost just $30,000 to make, according to Variety. Ms. Boreman said she was paid nothing.         ''Deep Throat'' and Linda Lovelace became household words and figured in three dozen books and 18 published songs. During Watergate, Washington Post reporters called their secret source Deep Throat.         But Ms. Boreman testified about the dangers of pornography before Congress, courts and city councils in the 1980's, and became a poster child for feminists like Gloria Steinem, who wrote an introduction to her 1986 book with Mike McGrady, ''Out of Bondage.''         Ms. Boreman insisted that she had made the movie only because her husband at the time, Chuck Traynor, threatened her with violence. ''I knew the feeling of a gun to my back and hearing the click, never knowing when there was going to be a real bullet,'' she said in her 1980 autobiography, ''Ordeal,'' written with Mr. McGrady.         Linda Boreman was born in the Bronx on Jan. 10, 1949, and moved to Yonkers when she was 3. Her father was a police officer, and her mother held Tupperware parties.         ''How does she do it?'' Vincent Canby asked in an article in The New York Times. ''The film has less to do with the manifold pleasures of sex than with physical engineering.''         She told of literally escaping from Mr. Traynor, who was already seeing his second wife, Marilyn Chambers, another pornography star. She hid out in different hotels for weeks, then began appearing in Las Vegas and London in skimpy costumes, drawing a smattering of publicity. The movie career for which she had hoped never materialized.         She later married Larry Marchiano. They divorced in 1996. She is survived by their children, a daughter, Lindsay, and a son, Dominic; a sister, Barbara Boreman; and three grandchildren.         The family lived on welfare when Mr. Marchiano was unemployed, and Ms. Boreman had a liver transplant in 1987. After they moved to Denver in 1990, she worked at low-paying jobs.         In recent years, she enjoyed the reception she received at memorabilia shows, said Eric Danville, author of ''The Complete Linda Lovelace'' (Power Process Publishing, 2001). ''People would tell her how much they loved her 100 times a day,'' he said.         Mr. Danville also recalled watching ''Deep Throat'' with her nine months ago. It was the first time she had seen it from start to finish.         ''I don't see what the big deal was,'' she said.       
         Wilma Cannon Fairbank, a historian of Chinese art and architecture, died on April 4 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 92.         Mrs. Fairbank had studied fine arts at Radcliffe College and was an apprentice to the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera before she traveled to Beijing in 1932 to marry John King Fairbank. Then a Rhodes scholar and a lecturer at Qinghua University, John Fairbank later became the leading scholar of modern China in the United States.         While in China, Mrs. Fairbank visited the remote countryside. There she studied Buddhist cave temples, ancient stone tomb carvings and bronze vessels, using her research to write scholarly articles on the methods and materials of early Chinese artists.         Her article on Han period tomb murals in 1941, in which she explained how she had been able to restore a crumbling ancient tomb, drew scholarly recognition and was translated into Chinese. The article earned Mrs. Fairbank membership in China's Institute for Research in Chinese Architecture, a professional organization.         Returning to the United States in 1936, she and her husband settled in Cambridge, Mass., where Mr. Fairbank was appointed to Harvard's department of history. During World War II, the Fairbanks moved to Washington, where she became the first employee of the China section of the State Department's cultural relations division, which dealt with scholarly and cultural exchange.         From 1945 to 1947, Mrs. Fairbank was cultural attaché to the United States Embassy in Chongqing and later, the nationalist capital, Nanjing.         In 1995 she published ''Liang and Lin: Partners in Exploring China's Architectural Past,'' a biography of a Chinese couple who were groundbreaking scholars.         Wilma Cannon Fairbank was born on April 23, 1909, in Cambridge, Mass., the oldest child of Dr. Walter B. Cannon, a professor at the Harvard Medical School, and the author Cornelia James Cannon.         Mrs. Fairbank's husband died in 1991. She is survived by two daughters, Laura Fairbank Haynes of Arlington, Mass., and Holly Fairbank Tuck of New York City; a sister, Marian Cannon Schlesinger of Cambridge, Mass.; a brother, Dr. Bradford Cannon of Lincoln, Mass.; and four grandchildren.       
         Barbara Anne Castle, a onetime Labor cabinet minister and determined socialist whose radical, ill-timed attempt to tame Britain's mighty trade unions doomed her political career, died yesterday. She was 91.         She died peacefully in her sleep at her home in Buckinghamshire, her family said in a statement. In a tribute, Prime Minister Tony Blair described her as a ''radical independent spirit.''         Baroness Castle of Blackburn, as she became in 1990, served in Harold Wilson's first two Labor cabinets, from 1964 to 1970, and in his third, from 1974 to 1976. After Mr. Wilson's surprise resignation in 1976, she might well have become party leader and the first woman to serve as prime minister. But the unions, aroused by her efforts to curb their power, cut short her rise.         In 1969, as secretary of state for employment and productivity and with the prime minister's enthusiastic support, Ms. Castle had published a plan called ''In Place of Strife,'' which sought to inject some discipline into Britain's chaotic industrial relations by making trade unions subject to legal sanctions.         The proposal proved popular with the public at large but split the Labor cabinet and provoked so furious a backlash from the unions, on whom the party relied for votes and money, that it had to be withdrawn.         The home secretary, James Callaghan, had led the opposition to her plan within the cabinet, and when he succeeded Mr. Wilson as prime minister in 1976 his first act was to dismiss her. He told her she was too old for ministerial office.         Three years later, despite a lifetime's opposition to British membership of the European Common Market, as it was then called, Ms. Castle left the House of Commons and embarked on a second political career as a member of the European Parliament, where she spent the next 10 years fighting European federalism but supporting efforts to establish Europe-wide social standards.         Considered one of the most left-wing members of Mr. Wilson's three cabinets, Ms. Castle was an intensely ideological politician, a stranger to compromise and pragmatism whose misfortune was to serve at a time when Britain's perilous economic condition required both skills.         As Britain's first minister of overseas development, she pulled together a disparate array of aid programs run by different departments and subjected them all to a single test: the promotion of development in backward countries.         In 1965 she took over the transport ministry, where she confronted the railway unions with a recommendation to close 2,000 stations and 3,000 miles of track -- a task proposed by the preceding Conservative government.         She also introduced breathalyzer testing in a crackdown on drunken driving that cut road deaths by 1,200 in the first year and ordered safety belts fitted to new cars.         As secretary for employment and productivity, she legislated equal pay for men and women. And after a spell in opposition, she overhauled Britain's social security system as secretary for social services, linking state pensions to average earnings and introducing new child allowances paid directly to the mother rather than through a husband's pay check.         But she always served in governments buffeted by industrial unrest and unending currency crises, which forced them into deflationary policies she could never accept. She also served under party leaders anxious to maintain good relations with Washington during the Vietnam War, which she strongly opposed. She differed with the leaders also over their resolve to retain Britain's nuclear deterrent, which she wanted to abandon, and their determination to keep Britain in the European Common Market, which she had never wished to join.         Barbara Anne Betts was born on Oct. 10, 1910, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the daughter of a socialist tax inspector who taught himself ancient Greek and a strongly socialist mother, both of Quaker background.         From Bradford Girls Grammar School she won a scholarship to St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where, excluded from the student debating society, known as the Union, because it did not admit women, she threw herself into Labor Party politics to the neglect of everything else, graduating with a disappointing third-class degree.         After Oxford she entered local politics in London and helped found a left-wing weekly, Tribune, which was edited by her lover, William Mellor, who died before they could marry. Soon afterward she met Ted Castle, a political journalist, and married him in 1944. He died in 1979. They had no children.         She was sent to Parliament for Blackburn in Lancashire in 1945 as part of the postwar Labor landslide. The election brought Clement Attlee to power and led to the creation of the National Health Service and the nationalization of large swaths of British industry.         Ms. Castle's personal popularity with the party's rank and file was confirmed in 1950 when she was elected to its national executive committee, a post she held until 1979. But in her autobiography she acknowledged that the split between the party's extreme left wing (led by the Welsh firebrand Aneurin Bevan) and Labor's leadership ''helped keep the party out of office for 13 years.''         In 1952, Mr. Bevan published a personal political testament called ''In Place of Fear'' that greatly influenced Ms. Castle's thinking and largely explains how a self-proclaimed leftist like herself could set out to discipline Britain's powerful unions.         She borrowed shamelessly from its title when she called her reform blueprint ''In Place of Strife,'' thus seeking to place it in the middle of radical Labor Party thinking. What inspired those reforms, she wrote in her autobiography, was Bevan's plea for politicians to be more flexible and his belief that their ''Holy Grail'' should be ''the living truth, knowing that the truth being alive must change.''         This lead Ms. Castle to conclude, as she put it, that ''the trade unions, being an expression of the living truth, must learn to change their role'' and become more responsive to the needs of society as a whole.         Although ''In Place of Strife'' was stillborn, the task she had set herself would be accomplished a decade later by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, in every way her antithesis and a woman she disliked.       
         Prof. Florence G. Roswell, who spent more than half a century teaching and writing, particularly about ways to diagnose and overcome reading disabilities, died May 4 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 97.         A former director of the reading clinic at the City College of New York, she remained active into her 90's, with several of her books and manuals published or reissued within the last few years.         She worked with Dr. Jeanne S. Chall, another leading expert on teaching children to read, to devise instructional materials to guide teachers. First published in the 1950's, these materials had a revival in the 1990's and remain in print. Dr. Chall died in 1999.         In 1997, Educators Publishing Company reissued the ''Roswell-Chall Auditory Blending Test,'' and the ''Roswell-Chall Diagnostic Reading Test of Word Analysis Skills.''         Florence Garfunkel Roswell was born in Manhattan in June 1904. She entered New York University at 16, majoring in English literature; she graduated in 1924.         She taught second grade for several years while taking graduate education courses at Teachers College. When children in her classroom were having trouble learning to read, she asked them to come to school earlier and stay later to help them catch up.         City College offered her a teaching fellowship in 1942, asking her to test children with various reading problems and to supervise student teachers. At the time, conventional wisdom regarding reading disabilities was that a child's difficulties were rooted in emotional problems, and that not much could be done by the teacher until the problems were addressed.         Based on her experience in testing and teaching poor readers, Professor Roswell took a more positive tack. She concluded that a child's reading deficiencies required special attention regardless of emotional problems. Her views and those of like-minded teachers eventually prevailed. Their stand brought about recognition of distinct disabilities like various kinds of dyslexia.         For teaching reading, she advocated using phonics along with the whole language method, or a system that chiefly exposes students to the sight of words. The dual approach meant that readers could be able to decode sounds and words.         Her first text, ''Reading Disability: A Human Approach,'' was published in the 1960's and had four printings. Most recently she was a co-author of ''Teaching Children to Read, a Step-by-Step Guide for Volunteer Tutors'' (Continental Press, 1998); and ''Creating Successful Readers'' (Riverside, 1994).         Professor Roswell is survived by a son, Dr. Arthur, of Bridgewater, N.J.; a daughter, Elaine Roswell of New Haven; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren. Her husband, David S. Roswell, an economist, died in the 1960's.       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early Sunday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for the dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote of the events in Warsaw. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism there and all over the European Continent.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink and outsmoke it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published and syndicated by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and later became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent as well.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Affairs. She was also given honorary doctorates by the University of California at Los Angeles, Columbia, Princeton, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Muhlenberg and Manhattan Marymount.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles. She earned a bachelor of arts degree three years later, in 1941, graduating summa cum laude and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board of directors, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancée jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a 1992 book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead, Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union. ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, ''It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Zena Sutherland, the most prominent reviewer of American children's books for nearly three decades and the author of five editions of ''Children and Books,'' the classic textbook on the subject, died on June 12 in Chicago. She was 86.         As the editor and reviewer of The Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, essentially a one-woman operation, she concisely assessed about 30,000 titles, more than 100 a month, from 1958 to 1985. The Bulletin is directed to librarians, but her words were also taken seriously by editors, publishers, writers and illustrators.         ''No other individual's views had such an impact on children's books then or now,'' said Roger Sutton, the editor of The Horn Book magazine and one of her many protégés.         Mrs. Sutherland led the way in the critical rather than sugary descriptive reviewing that accompanied the flourishing of American children's books. She explained the great change in the field of children's books that paralleled her career as the lifting of taboos, most of which reflected a sincere wish to protect children. She accepted children as real and aware individuals and their books as real literature, and she was a stalwart supporter of books that addressed a range of problems and issues that some still find shocking.         In 1963 the psychologically incisive picture book ''Where the Wild Things Are,'' by Maurice Sendak, was controversial in the way it depicted a child's temper tantrum. Mrs. Sutherland found it ''most imaginative and unusual.'' Her 1970 review of Mr. Sendak's ''In the Night Kitchen'' serenely sailed past little Mickey's brief nudity, which so disturbed other reviewers, and described the book as an ''engaging fantasy.''         Mr. Sendak remembered both her criticism and her friendship as ''a magnifying glass.'' He added, ''You couldn't lie or be sappy or ridiculous.''         Of John Donovan's ''I'll Get There. It Better Be Worth the Trip,'' a 1969 novel for young adults that introduced homosexuality as a theme, she said, ''It is not the crux of the story, and it is handled with dignity.'' Similarly, in 1974 she identified Robert Cormier's first novel, ''The Chocolate War,'' now considered a classic, as ''a sobering, dramatic and timeless story.''         Zena Karras was born in Winthrop, Mass., in 1915 and moved with her mother to Chicago after her parents divorced. She graduated from the University of Chicago in 1937, married Roland Bailey the same year and had three children. In 1956 she began course work at the Graduate Library School with the vague intention of becoming a medical librarian, took a children's literature course on a whim and was soon asked to take over The Bulletin temporarily.         Mrs. Sutherland also reviewed children's books for The Saturday Review from 1966 to 1972 and for The Chicago Tribune from 1972 to 1984. She taught at the Library School from 1972 to 1986 and served on all the important library and children's book committees, including those for the Newbery and Caldecott Awards.         She succeeded May Hill Arbuthnot as the author of ''Children and Books,'' the basic college text on children's literature, in 1972, and revised it regularly, most recently in 1996.         Her friendship with Scott O'Dell, the author of ''Island of the Blue Dolphins'' and other historical novels for children, led to the establishment in 1981 of the $5,000 Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction, of which she was the permanent chairwoman.         In 1983 a collection of articles in her honor, ''Celebrating Children's Books,'' generated royalties that were used to establish the Zena Sutherland lecture series, now run by the Chicago Public Library and the University of Chicago Lab School.         Her first marriage ended in divorce in 1961. In 1964 she married Alec Sutherland, a Scot who was then director of broadcasting at the University of Chicago. He died in 1990.         Her survivors include a daughter, Katherine Linehan, a professor of English at Oberlin College; two sons, Stephen Bailey, associate dean and professor of history at Knox College, and Thomas Bailey, a teacher in Hellenbaek, Denmark; seven grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         ''I love reading and I love reviewing,'' Mrs. Sutherland once said in an interview. ''Opening every single package was like Christmas. I have been known to stop in the middle of unpacking a load of books and sit down with one.''       
         June Jordan, who came of age as a poet when the voices of black female writers were just beginning to be heard, died on June 14 at her home in Berkeley, Calif.         She was 65. The cause was breast cancer, which she fought for a decade, said Adrienne Torff, a friend.         Like the careers of Audre Lord and Alice Walker, Ms. Jordan's was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. Her poetry was imbued with advocacy for the poor, for women and the disenfranchised.         In an interview yesterday, Ms. Walker, a close friend, called the small, elegant but tough Ms. Jordan, ''unwillingly nonviolent.'' In ''Poem About Police Violence,'' she wrote about the so-called accidental death of a black man in police custody: ''Tell me something/ what you think would happen if/ everytime they kill a black boy/ then we kill a cop/ everytime they kill a black man/ then we kill a cop/ you think the accident rate would lower/ subsequently?''         Still, Ms. Jordan could be a poet of great delicacy, as in ''On a New Year's Eve,'' in which she describes watching a lover sleep: ''and/ as I watch your arm/ your/ brown arm/ just/ before it moves/ I know/ all things are dear/ that disappear/ all things are dear/ that disappear.''         She was the author or editor of 28 books, essays and novels for children and the libretto for the 1995 opera by John Adams ''I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.''         She was also a teacher. At the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a professor of African-American Studies, she founded Poetry for the People, which trains undergraduates to take poetry to community groups as a form of political empowerment.         Ms. Jordan was born in Harlem, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Granville Ivanhoe Jordan, a postal clerk, and Mildred, a nurse. Ms. Jordan's mother was deeply depressed and eventually committed suicide.         Her father had wanted a boy and referred to her as ''he.'' In ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood'' (Basic Civitas Books, 1999) she described being brutally beaten by him: ''Like a growling beast, the roll-away mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: 'Daddy! What did I do?!' '' Yet her father helped forge her identity as a writer, she said, giving her books by Paul Lawrence Dunbar and forcing her to memorize Shakespeare.         In a radio interview two years ago, Ms. Jordan appeared to have come to terms with her father. She said: ''He didn't know what to do to try to provide against the failure of his only child in this new land. I think that probably contributed to the violence of his frustration. But that he loved me and thought me capable of anything and everything there was never any doubt.''         After the family moved to Brooklyn, Ms. Jordan became the only black student at Midwood High School. Later, she won a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, now the coeducational Northfield-Mount Hermon School.         After Northfield she attended Barnard College in New York City where she met Michael Meyer, a white student. The couple married and had a son, Christopher, who lives in Montana.         In her book of essays, ''Civil Wars'' (Scribner's, 1996), Ms. Jordan wrote of the difficulties of an interracial marriage. In 1966 the couple divorced. She raised her son largely on her own, struggling to eke out a living as a freelance journalist. She was a researcher and writer for Mobilization for Youth in New York, and in 1967 she got a teaching job at City College. Two years later she published a children's book, ''Who Look at Me?''         To the end, she remained involved in politics. In September Basic Civitas books is scheduled to publish ''Some of Us Did Not Die,'' which contains essays on Israel, Islam and O. J. Simpson. The book's title is from a poem she read last year in a speech at Barnard. She spoke of her battle with breast cancer and about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which she said proved the need for a secular democracy that protects the rights of ''male/ female/Jew/ Gentile/ Muslim.''         She read from a poem in which she imagined her dying body and a predatory hawk gliding overhead: ''He makes that dive/ to savage/ me/ and inches/ from the blood flood lusty/ beak/ I roll away/ I speak/ I laugh out loud/ Not yet/ big bird of prey/ not yet.''         Correction:  June 20, 2002, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about the poet June Jordan misspelled the middle name of an author whose books she credited with having helped forge her identity as a writer. He was Paul Laurence Dunbar, not Lawrence.         Correction:  June 27, 2002, Thursday  An obituary of the poet June Jordan on June 18 misspelled the surname of a poet whose career, like Ms. Jordan's, was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. She was Audre Lorde, not Lord.       
         Irène Lidova, a dance critic and producer who played a major role in founding creative ballet companies in postwar France, died on May 23 in Paris. She was 95 and lived in Paris.         Roland Petit, one of the world's major choreographers, was an unknown dancer chafing under the strictures of the Paris Opera Ballet when Ms. Lidova presented his first ballets with another young dancer-choreographer, Janine Charrat in 1943 and 1944. Producing the series Soirées de la Danse, she promoted young talent, including Jean Babilée and(Zizi Jeanmaire. As an outgrowth of these concerts, Ms. Lidova and others founded Les Ballets des Champs-Elysées in 1945 and made Mr. Petit's ballets the talk of Paris.         Born in Moscow, Ms. Lidova joined the ranks of Russian émigrés in Paris as a child with her family. After studying ballet, she began reviewing dance in 1939 in the Marianne and then collaborated with her Russian-born husband, the dance photographer Serge Lido.         In 1956 Ms. Lidova founded a company with the French-Yugoslav dancer Milorad(Miskovitch and was later involved in other producing activities. She was a critic for publications like Dance News in New York.       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early yesterday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for her dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy, in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism all over Europe.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and also became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from the Georgetown University School of Foreign Affairs.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles, where she earned a bachelor of arts summa cum laude and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fiancée jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union.         ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, 'It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died last night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Tormé seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike.         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and concert stages singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. ''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano,'' and ''This Old House.'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window,'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.         She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         In 1946, Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys all around the country speculated was was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947, she was gaining notice. In 1948, Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band, but Rosemary stayed with him another year before she left as well, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs For Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it but He insisted. The recording became a runaway best seller and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano'' that also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She married Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and made more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         But in the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle, and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This For Remembrance.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968, she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, She was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         In the 1990's, she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her children: the actor Miguel Ferrer; Maria, a designer; Gabriel, a painter married to Debby Boone; Monsita Teresa; Rafael, a voice-over actor, and her husband, Dante DiPaolo, a dancer. Other survivors include a nephew, George Clooney, the actor.       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died Saturday night at her home in Beverly Hills.

But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike. In the words of the director Mike Nichols, ''She sings like Spencer Tracy acts.''         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and on concert stages, largely with small groups, singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. Rather than acting out the romantic dramas of well-known song lyrics, she projects an understanding that is almost maternal in its blend of wisdom and empathy.''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' which became a huge hit record, and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano'' and ''This Old House,'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear long after she was pursuing a less-flamboyant repertory.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page, never to Rosemary Clooney. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said about her earlier recording career.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded pensive ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.

And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         She was nominated for an Emmy award for an appearance on ''E.R.,'' the series that featured her nephew George Clooney, and this year she was given a lifetime achievement Grammy award a month after she was hospitalized for lung cancer surgery.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness. One of the Clooney children, Andy, drowned as a boy swimming in the Ohio River. But the others survived and remained close. They included Betty, who sang professionally for a while with Rosemary; and Nick, who became a television performer. Another sibling, Gail, did not venture into show business.         When Rosemary was 10 and in the fourth grade, she made her acting debut in a school production of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' in which she played the witch. That same year her paternal grandmother died, sending her father into an intensified period of drinking. Rosemary and her siblings were sent to live with her mother's family, the Guilfoyles. After Rosemary completed the sixth grade her grandmother took her to Ironton, Ohio, east of Maysville. Two years later, they moved to Cincinnati.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them, and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         Grandmother Guilfoyle , who sewed as well as she could cook, made them dresses, and one of their uncles, George Guilfoyle, accompanied them on the band bus to make certain that they were not led astray by any of Mr. Pastor's musicians.         In 1946 Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys speculated was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947 she was gaining notice. Downbeat magazine said she had ''an extraordinarily good voice, perhaps the nearest thing to Ella Fitzgerald we've ever heard.'' In 1948 Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band. Rosemary stayed another year before she left, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording, no matter how many copies it sold.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs for Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television, including the Ed Sullivan show.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' The song was based on something old and Armenian, updated by the novelist William Saroyan and Ross Bagdasarian, who later changed his name to David Seville and created the Chipmunks. From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it, but he insisted, hinting broadly that if she refused, her career at Columbia might come to an end. The recording became a runaway best seller, and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano,'' which also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton,'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.

Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She fell in love with Dante DiPaolo, a dancer at Paramount studios, but jilted him to marry Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and to make more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         In the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle that went nowhere (he was married and the father of six children) and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic, and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This for Remembrance.'' ''The records I did then sound like they were made underwater. I misbehaved with everyone, onstage and off.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968 she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles by Sirhan Sirhan. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles.

She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         Unexpectedly she ran into Mr. DiPaolo, who moved in with her and became her road manager, and in 1996 she married him in the church in Maysville where she had been baptized.         In the 1990's she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label, and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her husband, Mr. DiPaolo; three sons, the actor Miguel Ferrer; Gabriel Ferrer, a painter and Episcopal priest married to Debby Boone; and the voice-over actor Rafael Ferrer; two daughters, Maria Murdoch, a designer; and Monsita Teresa Botwick; 10 grandchildren, her brother, Nick Clooney, and her sister, Gail Clooney Darley.         When she was in her 60's, Ms. Clooney said, ''If you hang around long enough, you get a lot of good stuff.'' Most of the time, she added, her life was pretty good.       
         Lorna J. Marshall, a college English instructor turned homemaker who in her 50's began a new life as an anthropologist studying the Bushmen of Africa, died on July 8 at her home in Peterborough, N.H. She was 103.         She had lived with her daughter, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas, since 1996, Ms. Thomas said. She previously lived in the same house in Cambridge, Mass., since the late 1920's.         Mrs. Marshall's anthropological career began when her husband, Laurence K. Marshall, a founder and president of the Raytheon Corporation, retired in 1950 with the thought that it was time to get reacquainted with his family.         ''Where is the remotest place we can go and be a family again?'' Mr. Marshall asked, said Irven DeVore, the More research professor of anthropology at Harvard.         The Kalahari Desert was the answer he found. He decided he would take his family to live among the legendary Bushmen.         ''They became a sort of Swiss Family Robinson of the Kalahari,'' Dr. DeVore said.         The family's accomplishments made it more than that. Mr. Marshall helped the Bushmen start a fine-wool industry. The Marshalls' son, John, began his career as a leading maker of ethnographic documentary films. Ms. Thomas, who would go on to write best sellers like ''The Hidden Life of Dogs,'' wrote a well-received book on the Bushmen, ''The Harmless People'' (Knopf, 1958).         Meanwhile, Mrs. Marshall began the painstaking process of documenting the culture and behavior of the Bushmen, sometimes called !Kung. (The ''!'' represents a clicking sound in their language). She was the first of dozens of scholars who have made the Bushmen one of the world's most studied populations of traditional hunter-gatherers.         ''To say she started it is not a mistake,'' Dr. DeVore said. ''By standards of ethnography, she did as well or better than any monograph I know, and she was there early.''         Over the next two decades, the Marshall family made eight trips to the Kalahari, a desert the size of Spain in what is now Namibia, Botswana and the Republic of South Africa, staying for as long as a year and a half at a time. Then the family would return to Cambridge, where Mrs. Marshall would employ the best graduate students to organize her voluminous notes, which resulted in two books and many articles.         An honor she particularly valued was having a !Kung baby girl named after her. The child was called Norna, because the Bushmen, for all their ability to make unusual vocal sounds, cannot pronounce the letter L.         Lorna Jean McLean was born in Morenci, a mining town in the Arizona Territory, on Sept. 14, 1898. Her father, Gordon McLean, a mining engineer, died when she was 7. Her mother, the former Bessie Holmes, remarried and moved with her daughter to Riverside, Calif., and then Los Angeles.         Miss McLean graduated from the University of California at Berkeley with a bachelor's degree in English. She then gave up the beginning of a career in ballet to travel around the world with her mother, who had been widowed again. They traveled throughout the Middle East and Asia. In China, they met an instructor at Mount Holyoke College who offered Miss McLean a job teaching English.         She accepted, but soon met Mr. Marshall in Nova Scotia, where both had relatives. They married and moved to Cambridge.         At the Cambridge Community Center, she organized women to salvage tungsten wire from radio tubes that Raytheon could re-use in making electronic devices. The salvage operation employed black and white women, unusual at the time, and permitted women to work flexible hours, which was also unusual.         Mr. Marshall said he wanted to do something with his family when he retired, and its members were interested in anthropology. So he asked his wife to take some courses at Harvard, which she did from time to time among trips to Africa.         The family was at first apprehensive about tales of poison darts and trance dances, but found the Bushmen polite and kind. The Marshall family lived in tents, even as temperatures ranged from freezing to 125 degrees.         Mrs. Marshall published her first book, ''!Kung of Nyae Nyae,'' in 1975 (Harvard University Press), and her second, ''Nyae Nyae !Kung Belief and Rites,'' three years ago (Peabody Museum Press).         She is survived by her daughter, her son, who lives in Belmont, Mass., three grandchildren and three great-granddaughters.         She is remembered by others. A year or so after her 100th birthday party, the child of a Bushman she had known as a child came to visit her.       
         Helen Matthew Robinson, the matriarch of the family that in 1864 bought the Hawaiian island of Niihau and then so zealously guarded its privacy that it is the only one of the islands where Hawaiian is still spoken as an everyday language, died on July 31 at her home in Makaweli, on the island of Kauai. She was 91.         Though Mrs. Robinson herded cattle at 65, climbed trees at 75 and drove until she was 85, her health had gradually deteriorated in recent years, her son Keith said. She finally had to relinquish decision making concerning the island, which she had assumed in 1969 with the death of her husband, Lester.         Keith Robinson said his mother's influence lived on in the indigenous people who still speak Hawaiian and in the population of rare monk seals on the coastline. Both are results of so severely restricting access to Niihau that it is known as ''the forbidden isle.''         Niihau (pronounced nee-ee-HOW), the seventh-largest Hawaiian island, is 69.5 square miles and is 17 miles southwest of Kauai. Geologically the oldest of the Hawaiian islands, it is considered the home of the volcano goddess Pele, according to legend. Niihau was the only Hawaiian island to vote against statehood in 1959.         The 200 or so residents collect delicate shells to make leis that sell for thousands of dollars. The islanders also work on the Robinsons' sheep and cattle ranch in return for salaries, free housing, food and education for their children. Their daily life seems a throwback to the misty Hawaiian past. There is no electricity or indoor plumbing -- rain is collected in buckets. There are no paved roads, and conversations are conducted in the lilting native language, though Mr. Robinson said that more English words were creeping in.         Guns and alcohol are forbidden, and the Robinsons will not bring tobacco on the weekly supply barge. The residents can be evicted at any time and have no contractual rights.         Mrs. Robinson herself tended to minimize the uniqueness of Niihau, even as she fought to preserve it.         ''It's just a little cattle ranch we operate in our own way,'' she said in a New York Times interview in 1970. ''There's nothing sensational about it. I don't see why everyone is so interested in it.''         The story of the Robinsons and the island begins in Edinburgh with Eliza Hutchinson, the widow of a Scottish sea captain, Francis Sinclair. With some of her children and their spouses, Mrs. Sinclair eventually went to the Sandwich Islands, as Hawaii was then known.         There she met the ruler of Hawaii, King Kamehameha IV, who offered her several parcels of land, including one that stretched from what became downtown Honolulu to Diamond Head in Waikiki. She turned it down in order to buy an entire island, paying $10,000 in gold in 1864.         As he signed the contract, the king said: ''Niihau is yours. But the day may come when Hawaiians are not as strong in Hawaii as they are now. When that day comes, please do what you can to help them.''         The family, who were strict Calvinists, required all residents of the island to attend Congregational church services on Sunday. (It was an easy sell: missionaries had converted them to Christianity 40 years before.) At first, visitors were permitted, though scarce water supplies began to limit invitations.         From the beginning, Mrs. Sinclair and her heirs sought to protect the indigenous culture. They also remained close to the royal family and opposed the American overthrow in 1893, after which the provisional government forbade use of the Hawaiian language.         Keith Robinson said the family totally cut off visits to Niihau in the 1930's because of the vulnerability of people to diseases to which they had never been exposed like measles, which had killed 11 children on the island.         Lester Robinson, Mrs. Robinson's husband, was the great-grandson of Eliza Hutchinson. He grew up in the family compound in the Makaweli District of Kauai, where Mrs. Sinclair had bought more property.         Helen Marion Matthew was born on Aug. 2, 1910, in Washington, D.C., which her family was visiting. She grew up in Berkeley, Calif., and graduated from the University of California.         Her aunt, a tutor to Lester Robinson when he was a boy, arranged a visit to the Robinsons in 1935, and a reluctant Lester was asked in advance to look after Helen. Rather than the dreaded child in pigtails he expected to meet, she turned out to be an attractive, friendly woman in her mid-20's. Keith Robinson said he had always heard it was love at first sight, though the two were not married until 1937.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Robinson rejected numerous offers for the island, including a large one from Japanese interests. The only intrusions she permitted were tourist helicopter flights overhead and secret military activities, which were kept away from both endangered wildlife and residents.         Keith Robinson said he and his brother, Bruce, had no intention of changing anything on the island, much less selling it. Mrs. Robinson is also survived by seven grandchildren.         In 1983, she wrote a letter to a researcher in which she chose one word to describe her vision of Niihau: ''seclusivity.'' It is not in the dictionary, but her meaning was apparent.       
         Daphne Bayne Hellman, the jazz harpist who performed around the world and for three decades at the Village Gate but who had a special affection for playing on subway platforms, died on Sunday at a nursing home in Manhattan. She was 86.         Ms. Hellman, who had played on the streets of Paris at a music fair as recently as June, was recuperating from injuries suffered in a fall last month near her town house on East 61st Street, her family said.         In a wildly peripatetic musical career that began in the 1940's at Town Hall -- where Time magazine called her ''as curvesome as a treble clef'' -- her professional choices were generally as eccentric as those she made in the rest of her life.         She saw nothing particularly unusual, she said, about plucking her harp on the street in front of the Hotel Pierre, where she came out to society in 1933, at a supper dance in the roof garden.         She did not seem to care what people thought when, after years of playing well-to-do places for well-to-do crowds, she also took the stage at clubs like CBGB, on the Bowery, accompanied by the kitchen-drawer percussion of a man called Mr. Spoons, otherwise known as Joseph Jones Jr., whom Ms. Hellman put up in her town house after his third wife left him.         She played the Beatles or Roger Miller or bluegrass warhorses like ''Foggy Mountain Breakdown'' with as much appreciation as she played Bach and Debussy, Gershwin and Kern.         Although she was an heiress with substantial means -- ''My mother had mucho money,'' she said in one interview -- she liked to count the money she earned when she began playing in the subway in the 1980's, sometimes carrying coins to a delicatessen near her house to trade them for bills.         ''She was just the antisnob, that's what she was,'' said Art D'Lugoff, who owned the Village Gate, where Ms. Hellman and her trio, Hellman's Angels, played every Tuesday for 30 years when she was in town. It was one of the longest nightclub runs in the city's history.         ''She had money and she knew a lot of people and she got along with everybody,'' said Mr. D'Lugoff, whose club closed in 1994. ''She opened up a new world for me, and I opened up a world for her.''         Ms. Hellman was sometimes compared to Katharine Hepburn, not only because of her high cheekbones and patrician good looks, but also because she lived a life of elegant rebellion, even before she first touched a harp at the age of 12.         Born Daphne Van Beuren Bayne, the granddaughter of the founder of the Seaboard National Bank, she recalled in a 1990 profile in The New Yorker that as a child she liked to keep bats and armadillos as pets. ''They are much maligned and misunderstood,'' she said of bats.         As a young woman, she first tried acting, training in New York and London and landing a walk-on part in a Broadway production of ''Hamlet.'' She also modeled for Man Ray and Harper's Bazaar. But after her marriage to her first husband, Harry Bull, the editor of Town & Country magazine, and the birth of their son, Sandy, she began to take the harp more seriously.         Over the strong objections of her father, she had her jazz debut at a cabaret called Le Ruban Bleu, at 56th Street and Fifth Avenue. Over the next few years, she played at a string of clubs that sound like a roll call from another musical era: the Hotel New Yorker, with Ving Merlin and his All-Girl Band; Upstairs at the Downstairs, with Blossom Dearie and Imogene Coca; Billy Rose's Diamond Horseshoe; the Versailles; Le Perroquet.         Once, at Le Ruban Bleu, according to the New Yorker profile, a young Billie Holiday, quite drunk, angrily refused to share the club's only dressing room with Ms. Hellman, who played there twice a year.         But most of Ms. Hellman's relationships with famous people were much more congenial and enduring. Her cluttered East Side town house, usually full of boarders, birds, dogs and litters of gerbils, served as the base for a kind of floating salon. And she was its musical Zelig, whose close friends included, besides Mr. Spoons, the historian Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr., the artist Saul Steinberg and the writer Norman Mailer.         In the 1940's, she had briefly supplied a beautiful face and high-society name to gossip columns when her marriage to Mr. Bull fell apart and she had an affair with Geoffrey T. Hellman, a writer for The New Yorker. She married him in Reno in 1941, hours after her divorce from Mr. Bull. (Her son, Sandy Bull, a noted guitarist, died last year; she is survived by a daughter, Daisy Paradis, and a son, Digger St. John.)         Mr. Hellman left her for another woman, and in 1961, she married Hsio-Wen Shih, a Chinese-American architect and writer, who left their home one day in 1965 and disappeared, breaking her heart, friends said.         ''It was like he went out for a pack of cigarettes and just didn't come back,'' said Lyn Christie, the bassist in Ms. Hellman's trio, who played with her for decades, everywhere from the subway to Sri Lanka, Madagascar, Bombay and Hong Kong.         ''It felt sort of like the trips we made to China were an attempt to try to find out about him,'' Mr. Christie said. ''But we never did come across him.''         Ms. Hellman's daughter, Daisy Paradis, said that her mother, who sometimes smoked a pack of Salems a day, had slowed down only slightly over the last few years. She had not played the subway for quite a while, mostly because it had become harder to find someone to help her lug her 85-pound harp down to the platform. But she played in Hong Kong and Sri Lanka this year and was appearing at the Firebird Cafe in Midtown at the time of her fall.         ''She was an incredibly intrepid woman,'' said Mr. Christie, who recalled that in Hong Kong she tried to ride on horseback into Communist China. ''She loved to do whatever she knew you weren't supposed to do.''       
         Doris Wishman, a prolific independent director of truly tasteless movies -- from nudist camp romps to the cult classic ''Bad Girls Go to Hell'' -- died on Aug. 10 in Miami. She lived in Coral Gables, Fla.         She never revealed her age, but her passport carried a date of birth of April 23, 1920, making her 82, said Michael Bowen, who is writing her biography. He said family members believe she was around 90.         Miss Wishman has been called the female Ed Wood, the legendary director of ''B'' movies. She wrote, produced, cast, directed and edited around 30 films, including several she made under pseudonyms. She rarely spent more than $70,000 on a picture, usually beginning by begging her sister Pearl Kushner, who also lives in Coral Gables and is her only immediate survivor, for startup money.         Joe Bob Briggs, the drive-in movie critic, called her ''the greatest female exploitation director in history.''         She often said she did not like her movies, but she clearly enjoyed making them. The title of Mr. Bowen's biography is ''It's Better Than Sex,'' a phrase she often applied to filmmaking. Her work, which had faded from view in the 1980's, made a resurgence after being featured at the Harvard University Film Archive in 1994.         She was born in Manhattan, and her mother died when she was a young child. Her father, who sold hay and grain, and his six children then moved to Westchester County. Miss Wishman took some courses at Hunter College and studied acting.         She took a job as a secretary and movie booker in a relative's film distribution business. She married an advertising executive, Jack Abrahms, and moved to Florida; he died a few years later.         In her grief she wanted work that would occupy all of her waking time. She decided she could produce independent films as well as distribute them, and hit upon the idea of making films about nudist camps. Recent court rulings had removed them from censorship.         She made a total of eight, including ''Blaze Starr Goes Nudist,'' the only feature film starring the burlesque queen (as herself).         ''Nude on the Moon,'' in which astronauts are greeted by naked women with pipe-cleaner antennas poking out of their bouffant hairdos, was banned in New York State. The censor board at the time allowed only films about nudist colonies, turning aside her argument that it was about a nudist camp on the moon.         In her next phase, she made sexual melodramas in which women were depicted as tragic heroines being exploited by men. There was nudity and plenty of violence against women but no explicit sex. In the grainy black-and-white pictures, which included titles like ''A Taste of Flesh,'' she defined a quirky personal style: bizarre cutaways to ashtrays, lamps and squirrels; suggestive lesbian subplots and gratuitous nudity and violence.         By the early 1970's, court decisions allowed and audiences demanded more explicit pornographic films. She made several, but left the room when sex scenes were being shot.         ''She was actually rather sexually naïve,'' Mr. Bowen said. ''She personally thought someone's hand caressing your face was more erotic than sex itself.''         Her big successes in the 1970's were two films starring Chesty Morgan, named for her commanding physical endowments. The movies had scant sex and very little nudity.         Miss Wishman wanted to make ''slasher'' films like ''Friday the 13th,'' but she lacked the money and technical skills. But in 1989, ''A Night to Dismember'' was finally released.         She had moved back to New York after the death of her husband and married again in 1966, a man she referred to only as Lou in interviews. The marriage ended in divorce in the mid-1970's.         She moved back to Florida in the late 1980's and was working in a lingerie store when interest in her work, which was readily available on video, began its resurgence. Her last movie, ''Each Time I Kill,'' will probably be released later this year, Mr. Bowen said.         He said that despite the raciness of her films she herself claimed little sexual experience.         ''I've had two husbands and a lover, and that's my quota,'' she said.       
         Jackie Raven, a performer and promoter of tap dancing, died on Aug. 19 at her home in Setauket on Long Island. She was 51.         The cause was breast cancer, said her husband, the trombonist Ray Anderson.         Ms. Raven began dancing fairly late in life as a student in Japanese studies at Barnard College. On a trip to Japan she had what she called a cosmic vision of becoming a tap dancer.         Back in New York, she studied with Jane Goldberg and Cookie Cook. ''Tap is like a disease in a way,'' she said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times. ''It gets you. And then that's it.''         Ms. Raven, who had a master's degree in linguistics from the State University of New York at Brockport, was a primary force in the tap dance revivals of the 1970's and 80's in New York.         She promoted Albert Gibson of the Three Chocateers and performed in his Gibson Girls chorus line. She also promoted George Hillman, who performed in the Broadway musical ''Black and Blue,'' and Ralph Brown, who had been a headline dancer with the Dizzy Gillespie Big Band.         Ms. Raven was a charter member of Brenda Bufalino's American Tap Dance Orchestra. In 1981 Ms. Raven founded the N.Y.C. Tapworks trio with Neil Applebaum, a dance-trained wrestler with a master's degree in child development. The trio was completed by Clara Hetherington, a hospital neuropsychophysiology technician.         The three performed a varied repertory of traditional tap steps, Latin and jump-rope numbers, as well as dances choreographed by Bill Irwin, Leon Collins and Ms. Bufalino.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Raven is survived by a son, Raven Anderson, and a daughter, Anabel Anderson, both of Setauket, and a sister, Deborah Libaire of Bellport, N.Y.       
         Erna Furman, an expert on grief in children and a child psychoanalyst who helped develop a teamwork therapy involving teachers, parents and therapists, died on Aug. 9 in Cleveland. She was 76.         The cause was lung cancer, said a spokeswoman for the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development, where she worked for about 50 years.         The Perkins Center used psychoanalytic ideas to help children deal with emotional problems and incorporated the idea of team treatment, which helped parents understand children's actions.         Mrs. Furman wrote, edited and contributed to books based on research at the center.         The book ''A Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement,'' which she worked on with the psychoanalyst Dr. Anna Freud in the 1970's, challenged the idea that children who lose a parent do not need the same attention that adults do. She showed that even toddlers can be helped to mourn a parent. The work won the American Medical Writers Association Book Award in 1975.         Mrs. Furman's book ''Toddlers and Their Mothers'' describes her findings from a 1980's research project on the importance of the mother-child relationship, particularly in the second and third years of life.         Mrs. Furman was born Erna Mary Poppe in Vienna on June 14, 1926. In 1938, her family fled to Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis. Four years later, however, she was sent to the Terezin concentration camp, near Prague.         While there, she kept a journal and drew portraits of other captives, many of them children whom she befriended and helped care for. Some of her drawings were later exhibited, to critical acclaim, in museums, including ones in Tokyo and Los Angeles.         Mrs. Furman, who was educated at the Academy of Commerce in Prague, came to the United States in the late 1940's. She received many honors for her contributions to child psychoanalysis and was made an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 1999.         Dr. Robert Furman, her husband of 48 years and her colleague, died Sept. 21 at 78. He was known for helping develop the Hannah Perkins Center and the Cleveland Center for Research in Child Development. He was the first director of the Hannah Perkins Center.         ''In many ways, it was the couple together, Dr. and Mrs. Furman, who made the Hannah Perkins Center what it is today,'' said Barbara Streeter, the center's therapy director.         The Furmans are survived by two daughters, Lydia Furman Peter of Cleveland and Tanya Furman Larson of State College, Pa.; and three grandchildren.         Correction:  October 9, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on Sept. 30 about Erna Furman, a child psychoanalyst and an expert on grief, gave a misspelled name in some references to the center where she practiced. It is the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development, not Hannah. Because of an editing error, Mrs. Furman's maiden name was misspelled. It was Popper, not Poppe. The article misstated the timing of Mrs. Furman's immigration to the United States. It occurred in the 1950's, not the 40's.         The obituary also misstated the role of the psychoanalyst Anna Freud in Mrs. Furman's book ''A Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement.'' Dr. Freud wrote an introduction; she did not contribute to the text.       
         Kim Hunter, whose eclectic 60-year career included an Oscar, two Emmy nominations and a Broadway triumph with her portrayal of Stella in the legendary 1947 debut of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' died on Wednesday at her New York apartment. She was 79.         A founding member of the Actors Studio whose screen career was temporarily derailed by the Hollywood blacklists of the 1950's, Ms. Hunter was recently hospitalized for a fall and had been in declining health. She died of a heart attack in her apartment above the Cherry Lane Theater in the West Village, said her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.         Ms. Hunter caught the acting bug in elementary school and was never a snob about the roles she chose, mixing highly demanding parts with smaller ones in B-movies, long stints in regional theater, television guest appearance and even a running role on an ABC soap opera, ''The Edge of Night,'' in 1979 and 1980.         But without doubt the roles for which she is most remembered are Stella Kowalski, Marlon Brando's passionate and beleaguered wife in the stage and film versions of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire,'' and Dr. Zira, the coquettish simian with a fondness for Charlton Heston in the 1968 film ''Planet of the Apes.''         The role of Stella also won her an Academy Award for best supporting actress when the director Elia Kazan adapted his Broadway production to the screen. The scenes of an anguished Stanley Kowalski (Mr. Brando), disheveled and grimy, screaming up to his wife -- ''Stella!'' -- in the backyard of their seedy New Orleans home, and of Ms. Hunter's sexually charged descent on a winding staircase into his arms, have become iconic cinematic moments.         Feisty, occasionally profane, Ms. Hunter frequently told interviewers that she had no use for the trappings of Hollywood stardom that had always eluded her.         ''The work itself has been my life,'' she said in 1999. ''I was never in this for jazzy stardom, and as far as that's concerned, I've never had it. Doesn't matter to me.''         Ms. Hunter was born in Detroit, and her father died four years later. Her mother and stepfather moved the family to Miami Beach when she was 10, and there she developed a taste for the theater.         ''I was lonely growing up,'' she said. ''My only brother was nine years older and had little time for me. So I picked friends out of books and played let's-pretend games, acting out their characters before a mirror.''         Before long she had an acting coach and made her stage debut at 17 in the title role of ''Penny Wise'' at the Miami Women's Club. Later she took roles with stock companies around the country. At the Pasadena Playhouse in California, in ''Arsenic and Old Lace,'' she was spotted by a talent scout and signed to a contract with the producer David O. Selznick.         For her 1943 screen debut, Selznick loaned her to the horror-film producer Val Lewton, for whom she played a young woman battling devil worshipers in ''The Seventh Victim.''         Shortly afterward, Ms. Hunter took a supporting role in the Ginger Rogers film ''Tender Comrade,'' about young women living communally during World War II, a film that struck some as pro-Soviet. It was cited, years later, as a reason that her name appeared in ''Red Channels,'' a 1950's pamphlet naming suspected Communist sympathizers.         Ms. Hunter, a liberal Democrat, had been a vocal supporter of civil rights, though she never belonged to the Communist Party. She said she traced her problems with the blacklist to a world peace symposium that she helped sponsor in 1949. No one ever announced that she was on a blacklist, she said.         ''Gradually it became sort of clear,'' she said. ''I think CBS was first. I was on the blacklist at CBS. No more CBS television. Then I think ABC dropped out and then, finally, it was NBC. And then by that time, I won my Oscar for the movie of 'Streetcar,' but I could not work in films. The last film I made was in 1951.''         Her hiatus from the screen lasted until 1956, when she appeared opposite Bette Davis in ''Storm Center,'' about book-burning. ''I thought, uh-oh, here we go again,'' she said. But her political problems did not reignite.         Ms. Hunter was one of the few forgiving voices when many in Hollywood rebelled against awarding Mr. Kazan a special Oscar in 1999. He had never apologized for naming names to Congressional investigators during the blacklist days.         ''The whole business is dumb,'' she told one interviewer. ''Artistic achievement and the mistake someone made years ago don't belong together.''         The ''Streetcar'' role came about because Selznick's wife Irene remembered the actress when it came time to cast the role of Stella. The play opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York, but rehearsals were held on the roof of the New Amsterdam Theater.         ''Tennessee sat way in the back and when he had a thought about something, he'd write a note and come down to where we were working, reach over and tuck the note into Kazan's coat pocket,'' Ms. Hunter said.         Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson praised the entire cast. ''All act not only with color and style, but with insight,'' he wrote.         Ms. Hunter's 1944 marriage to William Baldwin ended in divorce in 1946. The couple had one child, Kathryn, now of Stamford, Conn., who took the name of Ms. Hunter's second husband, Robert Emmett. Emmett, also an actor, died in 2000. The couple had a son, Sean Robert, also of Stamford, and Ms. Hunter is survived by six grandchildren.         As for her other most celebrated role, Ms. Hunter said ''Planet of the Apes'' was a project she respected. ''I thought it was a damned interesting script and a challenge for all of us,'' she said.         She spent hours at the Bronx Zoo, she said, studying primate behavior. But the project turned out to be more of a challenge than she had anticipated, largely because of the cumbersome makeup. ''The only part of me uncovered was my eyeballs,'' she said. ''I had to breathe through my upper lip. It was wild.''         Ms. Hunter also appeared opposite Humphrey Bogart in the 1952 drama ''Deadline USA,'' and drew critical praise in ''Lilith'' (1964) and ''The Swimmer'' (1968), among other roles. More recently, she had a small role in ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (1997).         ''Acting is my life,'' she said in 1994. ''It doesn't get easier. It gets harder. I find it more challenging as I do it and realize how much more has to go into it. But I thank God I am in a profession where there is no retirement age.''       
         Elizabeth Longford, the best-selling biographer and political activist who was the widow of the social reformer Lord Longford and the matriarch of a family that bred other well-known writers, died on Wednesday at her home in Sussex. She was 96.         From her school years through the nearly seven decades of her marriage to Lord Longford, she was famous for her intelligence, beauty, vitality and vivacity.         She was already an academic and social success at Oxford University when John Betjeman, one of the many literary figures she befriended, called her ''the aesthetes' moll.'' Quintin Hogg, who later as Lord Hailsham became a Conservative lord chancellor, said, ''There was not an undergraduate who would not consider it a privilege to hold an umbrella over her.''         Among her seven surviving children are the writers Antonia Fraser, Rachel Billington and Thomas Pakenham and the poet Judith Kazantzis. A daughter, Catherine, a magazine writer, died in a car crash at age 23 in 1969, and a prominent prize for women in journalism is named for her.         Lady Longford confessed to having ''an addiction to motherhood'' and continued to have children even after her Labor Party handlers said it was getting in the way of her parliamentary career. She ran for office unsuccessfully twice and had to bow out of a third contest, in which she was the favorite, because of pressure over her intent to have more children.         She was born Elizabeth Harman and was to be known as Elizabeth Pakenham for the first three decades of her marriage to Frank Pakenham; they became Lord and Lady Longford in 1961. She was the daughter of two Harley Street physicians and had a privileged upbringing.         Her biographies are known for their strong narrative lines and their wealth of research and detail, drawn from personal visits to historic sites. Her obituary in The Guardian of London said that she advised her children and grandchildren that ''not to study history would be like living in a house with no windows.''         The Longford marriage was one of the most celebrated in Britain. As partners, they deeply influenced each other.         She steered him away from his early Conservative Party enthusiasm to her socialist convictions. He persuaded her to convert to Roman Catholicism in 1946, a step he took in 1940.         Lord Longford, who died at 95 in August 2001, was a Labor peer famous for championing social outcasts and unpopular causes. When he was lampooned in later life as everything from an endearing eccentric to a bumbling loon, she was his passionate defender.         He was as unkempt as she was well turned out, and their contrasting appearances illustrated the nature of their partnership. Lord Longford always credited his wife with providing him with the self-control and common sense that he lacked.         Auberon Waugh, a godson, once said, ''I think he sees himself a little bit as a knight errant going out to do things which will please her.''         Lord Longford said at one of the couple's many anniversary parties: ''I think it would be very difficult to become bored with Elizabeth. No one else has ever been.''         Her writing career began after her third campaign for Parliament in 1950 and running after having had her eighth child. She began writing articles on family life and parenting for Lord Beaverbrook's Express newspapers. A collection of them, ''Points for Parents,'' was published by George Weidenfeld in 1956, and from there she moved on to larger subjects.         She received good reviews for her history ''Jameson's Raid'' in 1960 and then achieved widespread success with the biography ''Victoria R. I.'' in 1964; a two-volume life of the Duke of Wellington, ''The Years of the Sword,'' in 1969; and ''Pillar of State'' in 1972.         By the 1980's Lady Longford, who had begun public life as an ardent socialist, had become close to the royal family, and her next major biography was ''Elizabeth R,'' in 1983. She wrote about royals and political figures into her 90's, publishing her last book, a brief history called ''Queen Victoria,'' in 1999.         Sarah Bradford, a biographer of George VI, wrote in The Independent of London that Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother had said she felt that women could be divided into two groups, either beautiful and stupid or clever and plain, ''except Elizabeth Longford, of course.''       
         Alina Pienkowska, a shy and soft-spoken nurse whose impassioned words turned a shipyard strike in Gdansk, Poland, in 1980 into a nationwide and triumphant movement called Solidarity that ultimately helped to bring down Communism, died on Oct. 17 in Gdansk. She was 50. The cause was cancer, friends said.         Ms. Pienkowska spent much of her life in and around the giant shipyard on the Baltic shore. Her father worked there and had joined in protests in 1970 that led to army shootings in which dozens of workers were killed. A decade later, the young woman, widowed and with a young child, was working as a nurse at the yard.         By then she had become involved with a very small circle of activists who distributed a clandestine journal called The Coastal Worker, organized by Bogdan Borusiewicz, a passionate proponent of independent labor unions who was later to become Ms. Pienkowska's husband. Mr. Borusiewicz is currently a candidate for mayor of Gdansk.         In August 1980, Ms. Pienkowska was a withdrawn, single mother with prematurely gray hair who contributed articles to The Coastal Worker on health-related subjects like the rising rate of industrial accidents. That month, Anna Walentynowicz, a decorated crane operator at the shipyard and another member of Mr. Borusiewicz's circle, was fired. On Aug. 14, leaflets protesting her dismissal were distributed, and a dismissed welder named Lech Walesa, also in the group, climbed into the shipyard and proclaimed a strike.         From the windows of her apartment, Ms. Pienkowska saw that a strike had begun. Rightly assuming that state security agencies would have cut phone lines from the yard in the hope of keeping the strike secret from the nation and the world, she called friends in Warsaw, who alerted Western reporters, making sure the news would spread through Poland over Radio Free Europe.         But her greater contribution came two days later when she was with her fellow strikers in the shipyard. By then, many smaller factories and government establishments in the region had been struck, with their workers composing lists of demands. On Aug. 16, the shipyard management offered strikers there a considerable raise. The strike committee agreed, and Mr. Walesa announced that the strike had ended. Thousands of jubilant workers headed for the gates and home.         Ms. Pienkowska was enraged, realizing that as a result of the agreement tens of thousands of strikers at plants throughout the region were being left in the lurch. She found the voice and courage to attack Mr. Walesa.         ''You betrayed them,'' she said of the strikers beyond the shipyard walls. ''Now the authorities will crush us like bedbugs.''         She managed to shut one gate and pleaded for the strikers to stay and maintain the strike. Some lingered, but most rushed home to their families. But Ms. Pienkowska's message got through, and in many cases wives sent their husbands back; by nightfall the shipyard was filling up once more.         The strike had been salvaged in the spirit of solidarity, a word that would soon provide the free trade union movement with its name.         Among those who praised Ms. Pienkowska after her death was Andrzej Wajda, who said that she had been the model for a character in his film ''Man of Iron,'' which was based on events in the shipyard.         He said the actress who played the role spoke Ms. Pienkowska's words: ''Here in the shipyard I stopped being afraid, stopped running away, and became a real person.''         Immediately after her intervention, she was elected to a new strike committee that was able to negotiate the historic agreement guaranteeing workers the right to form unions independent of the government or the ruling Communist Party.         For the next decade she worked for Solidarity, both when it was legal and when it was outlawed in 1981. At the outset of the martial law period, she was detained and held for more than a year.         In 1983 she married Mr. Borusiewicz, who was in hiding, in a secret ceremony. A year later her husband, still a fugitive, attended the baptism of their son while disguised as an old woman. Mr. Walesa, a guest, unsuspectingly kissed his hand.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her daughter, Kinga; and her son, Sebastian.       
         Mary Maxine Reed, who in 1971 won a landmark Supreme Court case that struck down dozens of state laws discriminating against women, died on Sept. 26 near Boise, Idaho.         She was believed to be about 93, though she would not tell her age, her lawyer Allen Derr said.         On Nov. 22, 1971, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that an Idaho law that automatically gave Mrs. Reed's former husband preference over her as administrator of their dead son's estate violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law.         The Supreme Court called the Idaho law ''the very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause.''         It was the first time the Supreme Court had declared a state law unconstitutional because it discriminated against one sex.         The ruling overturned many similar laws around the country, including another Idaho law declaring the husband the head of the family, with the right to determine where it lives, as well as a 1948 Michigan law prohibiting women from serving alcoholic drinks in bars. Previous challenges to such laws before the Supreme Court had failed.         The case came about in 1967 after the Reeds' 16-year-old son, Richard Lynn Reed, shot himself. Mrs. Reed and her former husband, Cecil, from whom she was divorced in 1958, applied to a court to administer their son's small estate, which consisted chiefly of a clarinet, phonograph records, clothes and $495 in a savings account.         Mrs. Reed lost the first court battle because Idaho law said that when two people were equally qualified to be administrators, preference must be given to a man.         Saying she was angry that ''women could be stepped on like that,'' Mrs. Reed then appealed to the District Court and won.         But the Idaho Supreme Court reversed that decision on appeal. Mrs. Reed took her case to the Supreme Court.         Mary Maxine Reed, known as Sally, was probably born in Nebraska around 1909. Orphaned early, she was adopted by George and Nettie Kelso, who moved to Cambridge, Idaho, where they farmed. She graduated from Cambridge High School in 1929 under the name Mary Kelso.         In 1931 she married Cecil R. Reed in Ontario, Ore. They eventually moved to Boise, where her husband worked for the Idaho Highways Department. They adopted Richard Lynn, their only child.         After their divorce, Mrs. Reed earned her living by ironing, baking, baby-sitting and looking after disabled people in her Boise home. She retired in 1998.         In a widely reported legal battle that contrasted with the rest of her quiet life, Mrs. Reed was assisted by Mr. Derr, her Boise lawyer, and two lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, Mel Wulf and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is now a Supreme Court Justice.         In a letter to Mr. Derr read at Mrs. Reed's funeral on Oct. 5, Justice Ginsburg said, ''Sally Reed lived to see the good that came from her brave decision to challenge an unjust law.''       
         Harriet Doerr, who at 73 published her first novel, unveiling an exquisite gift to marshal clear, sparse prose to evoke, in her phrase, memories ''like a gentle knife stuck into your heart,'' died on Sunday at her home in Pasadena, Calif. She was 92.         She had been in declining health since she suffered a broken hip in a fall last month, said her daughter, Martha Doerr Toppin. In recent years, glaucoma and frailty kept her from writing, even at her methodical pace of a sentence or so an hour.         Ms. Doerr's gleaming literary reputation rested on three slender books, perhaps 600 pages in all.         Her first book, ''Stones for Ibarra'' (Viking, 1984), which won the American Book Award for first fiction, was called ''a perfect book'' by the writer Alice Adams, and her next novel and a book of short stories elicited similar praise.         Her style roamed the geography of Mexico, memory and mood in a manner that the critic Anatole Broyard in The New York Times said carried ''echoes of Gabriel García Márquez, Katherine Anne Porter and even Graham Greene.'' Her gift for phrasing was suggested by her description of the Mexican village as ''no more than a shard chipped from the rock face of eternity.'' Elsewhere she called it ''a town of a hundred burros.''         Her critics generally agreed that she improved with age, and emphasized that her works would have been remarkable for a writer of any age.         In reviewing her second novel, ''Consider This, Señora'' (Harcourt, 1993), published in 1993, when she was 83, the critic Margo Jefferson wrote in The Times, ''Everything is richer, as when an actress takes a role you saw her play a decade ago, and lets you read that decade in her face, her voice and her body.''         Harriet Green Huntington was born in Pasadena on April 8, 1910, the third of six children and two step-children. Her grandfather was Henry Edwards Huntington, and she played with her siblings at his San Marino estate, which is now the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. She grew up with nannies and servants, as well as more intangible blessings: her family loved reading and lively discussions, her daughter said.         Ms. Doerr was asked to read several of her poems at high school graduation, but would not allow the school to reproduce them because she thought they were awful. When she was 16, she met Albert Doerr, an engineering student at Stanford University who took her to a prize fight on their first date. She was horrified, not least because of the droplets of blood that had spattered on her dress.         She went east to Smith College in 1927 with her train compartment filled with roses from Mr. Doerr. She did not like the cold of Massachusetts and felt homesick and ''half in love.'' By the summer of 1928, she left Smith and transferred to Stanford. where Mr. Doerr was finishing his degree. They married in 1930, and she left college.         They had two children; the first, a son, Michael, died of cancer in 1995. Ms. Toppin, the second child and Ms. Doerr's only survivor, lives in Oakland.         In World War II, while her husband served in the Navy, she and he signed petitions protesting the relocation of Japanese-Americans to internment camps.         The family went to Mexico in the late 1950's. There Mr. Doerr oversaw the revival of his family's mining business. Much of the emotional quality of that experience is contained in Ms. Doerr's first novel, including the male protagonist's struggle with leukemia. Mr. Doerr died of leukemia in 1972.         Her son teased Ms. Doerr into returning to college in 1975. She first took some classes at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., and then enrolled full time at Stanford, majoring in history. She was accepted into the university's prestigious creative-writing program. Other students resented her presence, until she read her first piece aloud.         Ms. Doerr won the $2,500 Transatlantic Review-Henfield Foundation Award in 1982, based on three stories she had published in small literary magazines. Senior editors at Viking Penguin suggested her stories could be combined into a novel. She and a professor shuffled them on her living room floor until a larger narrative fell into place.         Her next novel, ''Consider This, Señora,'' was also set in Mexico and was seen by some critics as imitative. But Laura Cumming, writing in The Guardian of London, said it was ''full of enchanted fables.''         ''The Tiger in the Grass'' (Viking, 1995) was a collection of essays, many about Mexico. But words of searing pain reflected a more immediate concern: her son was then dying of cancer, and Ms. Doerr used italicized passages to tell his story. In one, she remembered that his first word was ''car'' and that the doctor had just forbidden him to drive.         ''Now his car is parked outside his house and is visible from several windows,'' she wrote. ''I have forgotten the details of Chinese water torture we used to hear of, but it must be something like this.''         Ms. Doerr believed in no religion, but often took solace in each person's ability to create memories that live on. In ''Consider This, Señora,'' the character Ursula Bowles, a widow who enters the story at age 79 and exits at 83, witnesses life's evanescence.         ''She could see that an individual life is, in the end, nothing more than a stirring of air, a shifting of light,'' Ms. Doerr wrote. ''No one of us, finally, can be more than that. Even Einstein. Even Brahms.         ''Then the widow slept.''       
         Leah Harrison, an expert on child abuse, died on Monday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 55 and lived in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y.         The cause was complications of acute myelogenous leukemia, said her husband, Fred Harrison.         In 1988, Mrs. Harrison was a founder of of the child-protection program that in 1997 became the J.E. and Z.B. Butler Child Protection Center of the Children's Hospital at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. When she died, she was associate director of the center, which has been influential in shaping other anti-child-abuse programs around the United States.         She also headed the UJA-Federation Family Violence Task Force's subcommittee on children and worked with leaders in Jordan, Israel and other countries in setting up pilot programs for guarding children against abuse.         The Leah Harrison Educational Center for Child Protection at Montefiore was named in her honor.         Leah Epstein Harrison was born in Norwalk, Conn., and grew up there. After receiving a bachelor's degree in nursing from Pace University and a master's degree in nursing from Seton Hall University, she joined Montefiore in the late 1960's.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Lillian Epstein of Boca Raton, Fla.; two sons, Eric, of Brewster, N.Y., and Bradley, of Washington; a sister, Roberta Goldstein of Greenbrook, N.J.; and two brothers, Neil Epstein of Trumbull, Conn., and Richard Epstein of Norwalk, Conn.
