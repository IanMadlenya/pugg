         Dominique de Menil, a connoisseur, art collector and creator with her husband, John, of the Menil Foundation in Houston, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 89.         Mrs. de Menil and her husband, whose fortune came from oil-well technology, became widely known for commissioning the nondenominational Rothko Chapel near Houston, designed by Philip Johnson and dedicated in 1971. With its somber meditational paintings by Mark Rothko and its adjacent sculpture, ''Broken Obelisk'' by Barnett Newman, it soon became a place of ecumenical pilgrimage.         As collectors, the de Menils cut a very wide swath. Their first serious purchase was a Cezanne watercolor that Mr. de Menil had bought in New York in 1945 on the advice of the Rev. Marie-Alain Couturier, a French Dominican priest and a friend of theirs. Thereafter, everything that was of true quality interested them, from Etruscan art to Cycladic sculptures, Byzantine bronzes, African tribal art, the Surrealist paintings of Max Ernst and the recent work of Cy Twombly, an American painter long resident in Italy.         Public awareness of the size and quality of what they had bought was heightened when the Menil Collection museum opened in Houston in 1987. Mrs. de Menil had commissioned the Italian architect Renzo Piano to build a museum that would ''look small on the outside and be big on the inside.''         Its apparent modesty, allied to a seraphic perfection of detail, made it one of the most beautiful museum buildings in the United States. With no admission charge, no membership and no museum shops, it fostered the contemplation of an astonishingly wide range of objects, from antiquity to the Parisian and American avant-garde of recent times.         The full breadth of the de Menil art collection became evident when a massive selection from it, titled ''Rhyme and Reason,'' was shown at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1984.         Mrs. de Menil's attitude to art was not at all that of an esthete who stood apart from or above mundane concerns. One of the de Menils' earlier ventures in Houston was to take a derelict movie house, the De Luxe Theater, in a neighborhood of mostly black residents and to turn it into a center for exhibitions of works by black artists through the ages. She chose and installed those exhibitions herself. Starting in 1960, the de Menils financed a research project that culminated in a monumental publication called ''The Image of the Black in Western Art.''         From 1973 onward, the Rothko Chapel doubled as a center for colloquiums aimed at fostering mutual understanding on issues affecting justice and freedom throughout the world. The first colloquium drew scholars from Lebanon, Iran, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Japan, Italy, the United States and Canada.         In 1991 the Rothko Chapel marked its 20th anniversary with a joint award with the Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation, founded in 1986 with former President Jimmy Carter. Nelson Mandela was the keynote speaker and received the special Rothko Chapel award. The projects were not simply highminded pastimes for Mrs. de Menil. Despite her gentle bearing and soft-spoken ways, those who knew her said she was fervently committed to the causes championed at the Rothko  colloquiums.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. de Menil was a discreet but seemingly ubiquitous force for understanding in many areas of life. The house in Houston in which she and her husband lived and raised their five children was open to people of every age, nationality, color and religion.         Dominique de Menil, the daughter of Conrad Schlumberger and his wife, Louise Delpech, was born in Paris on March 23, 1908. She studied mathematics and physics at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1927-28. Though born in a bastion of French Protestantism, she converted to Catholicism to marry John (then Jean) de Menil in 1931.         In 1941 the de Menils left Nazi-occupied France and made their way to the United States, where Mr. de Menil was to represent the family firm of Schlumberger both in North and South America. Some years after they settled in Houston, they asked Philip Johnson to build them a house for them and their five children.         When it was completed in 1948, people told them that there had never been a flat roof in Houston. ''You'll never be able to sell it,'' they said. Mrs. de Menil said that she didn't mind about the market because she wasn't building to sell. ''Anyway,'' she said later, ''no sooner was our house built than you saw flat roofs everywhere.'' The house was also remarkable for the debut of a celebrated American couturier, Charles James, as an interior designer. It was his belief that only corridors and dark corners should have color, and that the living room should be kept quite plain. As an interior, at that or any other time, it was surprising.         After Mr. de Menil (by then called John, since he had become an American citizen) died in 1973, Mrs. de Menil continued their work. She maintained the Menil Foundation's commitment to two major scholarly enterprises -- the catalogue of the complete works of Magritte, by David Sylvester, and of Max Ernst, by Werner Spies.         Her most recent project was the recovery of a series of Byzantine frescoes on the subject of St. Themnianos from a church in the town of Lysi on the island of Cyprus. Permission was given for her to have them on indefinite loan from Cyprus, provided that they were installed in a chapel consecrated to the Greek Orthodox church. They were installed last February in a chapel designed by her son, Francois.         The French Government conferred on Mrs. de Menil the title of Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in 1984. Two years later, she received the National Medal of Arts from President Ronald Reagan.         In addition to her son Francois, she is survived by another son, Georges; three daughters, Marie-Christophe de Menil, Adelaide de Menil Carpenter and Philippa de Menil Friedrich; 11 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.         A funeral service is to be held on Saturday at 2 P.M. at St. Anne's Church in Houston.       
         Esther Wolf Lopato, a child psychologist who was active in civic affairs in Brooklyn and beyond, particularly on behalf of public libraries, died on Jan. 7 at her home in the Midwood neighborhood of Brooklyn. She was 77.         She had suffered a long illness, her family said.         At her death, Dr. Lopato was a trustee of the Brooklyn Public Library. She was named to its board by Mayor John V. Lindsay in 1973 and was reappointed last year by Borough President Howard Golden.         She was the board's vice president from 1976 to 1978 and trustee president from 1979 to 1981. She also served on citywide, state and national committees promoting libraries, including the American Library Trust Association and the 1979 White House Conference on Libraries.         She continued in private practice after retiring in 1988 as a certified psychologist and school psychologist from the educational psychology department at New York University. She had been working there at the Children's Consultation Service, in charge of a testing and counseling center for children ages 3 to 16.         For 25 years, she made diagnoses, conferred with parents and wrote referrals to physicians, schools and various agencies.         Born in the Bronx, she was raised in Brooklyn and graduated from City College in 1948 with a degree in education. A year later, she received a master's degree from City College in psychology, to which she added a Ph.D. in psychology from N.Y.U. in 1960. In recent years, she was vice chairman of Community Planning Board 14 and was on the executive board of the Midwood-Kings Highway Development Corporation and on the board of the Brooklyn College Performing Arts Center, which gave her its Distinguished Community Service Award in 1995.         Her husband, Allan Lopato, died 30 years ago. She is survived by a daughter, Dr. Leslie Lopato of San Francisco; a son, David, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Mona May Karff, who won the United States women's chess championship seven times, died on Jan. 10 at her home on Riverside Drive in Manhattan. She was 86 and had been among the first four Americans to attain the rank of international woman master.         The cause was heart failure, friends said.         From the time she won her first national title at the second women's championship in 1938 until she clinched her seventh national championship in 1974, Miss Karff was in the forefront of women's chess in the United States. She and a handful of other players, among them the late Sonja Graf Stevenson, the late Mary Bain and 92-year-old Gisela Kahn Gresser, a nine-time titleholder, dominated tournament competition.         For all her victories and the wide recognition she won in American chess circles, Miss Karff, who also won four straight United States Open titles, was something of a mystery.         A refined, elegant woman who loved opera, collected art, spoke eight languages fluently, traveled the world with confident ease and made millions in the stock market, she was an intensely private person of such shadowy origins that the United States Chess Federation lists her birthplace simply as Europe, and until recently her best friend had no idea she had once been married.         In fact, according to relatives in Israel, Miss Karff, whose maiden name was Ratner, was born in the Russian province of Bessarabia, moved to Palestine when she was a teen-ager and came to the United States in the 1930's, settling first in Boston, where she had a brief marriage to a cousin, Abe Karff, a lawyer who died several years ago.         ''I knew she had a cousin in Boston,'' her friend, Bea Lacativa, said, recalling that it was not until she called the cousin's telephone number when Miss Karff was hospitalized last year that she learned that the cousin had also been her husband.         By her own account, Miss Karff was 9 when she learned chess from her father, Aviv Ratner, a Zionist who acquired a vast amount of property in Tel Aviv and later became one of the richest men in Israel.  Although she was soon defeating her father and others with ease, Miss Karff was at first so diffident about her skills that friends had to coax her to enter her first tournament. When she won handily, the diffidence was replaced by something akin to a full-blown obsession.         For all her success in the United States, Miss Karff, who was forever sailing off to Europe or South America for tournaments, fared less well in top international competition. Representing Palestine in the 1937 women's world championships in Stockholm, she placed sixth. Playing for the United States at the 1939 World Championships in Buenos Aires, she came in fifth.         The winner both times was Vera Menchik, who held the women's world title from 1927 until her death in 1944 and was one of only two women, along with Judit Polgar, a current international grandmaster, to hold their own against men in the highest levels of the game.         Like almost every other woman in chess, Miss Karff limited herself to women's tournaments, qualifying as an international woman master when the International Chess Federation created the title in 1950 to encourage women's competition.         After women's world championship competition resumed in 1950, Miss Karff represented the United States in several tournaments, always finishing well back in the field.         By then, the woman who had styled herself ''N. May Karff,'' typically without explaining what the ''N'' stood for, had moved to New York and emerged as Mona May Karff, a name she used when she made a tour of Europe in 1948 for the One World movement.         In New York, she became a fixture at the Marshall Chess Club on West 10th Street and began a long romance with Dr. Edward Lasker, a five-time winner of the United States Chess Open. Dr. Lasker was 25 years older than she, but friends recall them as a perfectly matched couple.         After Dr. Lasker died in 1981 at 95, Miss Karff continued to play regularly at the Marshall, where she was cherished both for her own achievements and as a bridge to American chess history through her association with Dr. Lasker, who won his first open in 1916 and later played a famous match with Frank J. Marshall, a longtime champion who founded the club.         She is survived by a niece, Miriam Reik, and two grandnephews, Dani and Aviv Reik, all of Tel Aviv.       
         Marilyn Costello, the principal harpist of the Philadelphia Orchestra for 46 years and a respected teacher at the Curtis Institute of Music, died on Jan. 5 at her home in Philadelphia. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, said Ann Diebold, a spokeswoman for the Curtis Institute.         Ms. Costello was born in Cleveland and began her musical studies as a pianist. She made her public debut in a concert at the Cleveland Museum of Art when she was 6, and won prizes in several competitions while a teen-ager. She decided to study the harp when she was 14, after running her hands across the instrument's strings backstage at a concert of the Cleveland Orchestra.         Her principal studies were with Carlos Salzedo, the composer and harpist, at the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia, and it was during her second year as a student there, in 1945, that Eugene Ormandy, the conductor, invited her to join the Philadelphia Orchestra. She was the orchestra's second harpist for about half a season, and was appointed principal harpist in 1946, a position she held until her retirement in 1992.         Ms. Costello joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute in 1962, and taught harpists who eventually took positions in many of the world's great orchestras, including the Berlin Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, the St. Louis Symphony and the National Symphony.         She is survived by her husband, L. Daniel Dannenbaum; a son, Daniel George Dannenbaum, and two stepdaughters, Marianne Kierstead of Merrimack, N.H., and Alison Lang of Lillooet, British Columbia.       
         Mary Ingraham Bunting-Smith, the Radcliffe president who sought ways to help educated women carve out careers in a society not yet transformed by the feminist movement and became a mentor to several female writers, performers and scholars, died on Wednesday at Kendal at Hanover, a continuing care community in New Hampshire. She was 87.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith, a microbiologist who was Radcliffe president from 1959 to 1972, was called Polly from childhood and added Smith to her name after her second marriage,  in 1979.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith, who was also known for overseeing the fuller integration of Radcliffe College into Harvard, founded the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study -- now the Bunting Institute -- to help women who were scholars, writers, artists and scientists return to careers interrupted by family obligations.         ''Polly Bunting was always ahead of her time in anticipating the needs of women and of Radcliffe College,'' said Derek Bok, president emeritus of Harvard and a professor there. ''The idea of the Radcliffe Institute seems so obvious now. But the idea that there would be women who wanted to come back was a new idea then, and she saw that and created an institution that made it possible.''         Mrs. Bunting-Smith was also the first female member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the President's Committee on the Status of Women and a vice president of the Peace Corps.         Underused women and interrupted careers were a theme for Mrs. Bunting-Smith. She chided society for its ''waste of highly talented, educated womenpower,'' as she put it in a 1961 article she wrote for The New York Times Magazine, calling it a ''prodigious national extravagance.''         A soft-spoken woman who herself had worked part time while her children were young, she devoted her life to fighting that waste, to raising expectations among and about women and to creating opportunities for them.         As she saw it, two ''hidden dissuaders'' lowered the professional expectations of women: a system of higher education that, first, ignored real differences between male and female patterns of life and, second, did not provide for women who wanted to keep working part time in their fields while raising families. She established the Radcliffe Institute specifically to give scholarships to women cut off from careers by marriage.         To see a model of an active, engaged woman, Mrs. Bunting-Smith had only to look within her own family. Born in Brooklyn in 1910, she was one of four children of Mary Shotwell Ingraham, who was president of both the Brooklyn Young Women's Christian Association and the Y.W.C.A.'s national board. Her mother was also  a member of the New York City Board of Higher Education who helped plan the creation of the City University. Her father was Henry A. Ingraham, a lawyer and one of the founders of Long Island College of Medicine.         In her early years, Polly Bunting loved being outside. Although an avid reader, she did not go to school regularly until high school, because of her uncertain health. And she did not enjoy school. ''I was glad to get rid of it in the afternoon and get back to something interesting,'' she once said.         A growing interest in the sciences drew her into academia. She majored in physics at Vassar College, her mother's alma mater. At the University of Wisconsin, she studied agricultural bacteriology, earning a master's degree and a doctorate and meeting her husband, Henry Bunting, a medical student who shared her interest in hiking and bird watching. During his medical residency, she taught at Bennington College in Vermont. They married in 1937 and moved to Connecticut, where he was on the faculty of Yale University and she conducted research, working on the effects of radiation on bacteria.         While her four children were young, she spent more time at home, in Bethany, Conn. But even with young children, Mrs. Bunting-Smith was a 4-H leader, served on the library and school boards and was one of the organizers and directors of the Public Health Nursing Association.         When her husband died of a brain tumor in 1954, however, Mrs. Bunting-Smith was forced to look for a full-time job. Because she was a woman, there were no faculty openings at Yale, her son Charles recalled yesterday, and she jumped at the offer to become dean of Douglass College, the women's college of Rutgers University. She was a professor in the department of bacteriology there and an honorary professor at the Rutgers Institute of Microbiology.         At Douglass, she introduced a multilingual course in world poetry run by the students, as well as a program of part-time study for married women.         Five years later, at age 48, she was offered a job as the fifth president of Radcliffe College, the undergraduate college for women at Harvard University, with about 1,775 women.         She liked talking to students and kept an open door. She taught a freshman seminar. In meetings with students, she would sometimes kick off her shoes and invite her guests to do the same, and to join her on the floor. She also liked to chat with students who dropped by her Brattle Street house, and she would turn on her porch light on to signal that she was in.         Such access did not protect her from student protest. In the late 1960's, 20 black students sat in the Radcliffe administration offices seeking increased minority enrollment. Mrs. Bunting-Smith, who was at a conference in North Carolina, flew back to meet with the protesters and promised to act on their complaints. She faced other protests during the Vietnam War.         Another source of dissension was her work to merge Radcliffe more completely into Harvard. Radcliffe students already took classes with Harvard students, but they were admitted to college separately and had their own living quarters, administration and trustees. Mrs. Bunting-Smith thought the system inequitable and worked to integrate the campuses more fully, even though it ultimately reduced the role of the Radcliffe president.         But she may be best remembered for the establishment of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, which opened in 1961 with the help of $150,000 from the Carnegie Foundation and other grants. Its purpose was to pursue research into the psychological and cultural factors that affected women's status in society, and also to support female artists, scientists and scholars, particularly those who had suspended their careers because of family responsibilities.         In its first year the institute gave 20 women scholarships of up to $3,000 each, space to do their work and access to Radcliffe and Harvard services.         The poet Maxine Kumin, a member of that first group of scholars, remembers her two years at the institute as an ''amazing'' experience, with a diverse group of artists, scientists, social scientists and poets, ''with Polly Bunting as our ringmaster.''         Ms. Kumin said that at a time when she was teaching English composition to physical education majors at Tufts University because only men were allowed to teach liberal arts majors, ''being chosen as a Radcliffe scholar put an imprimatur on what you were doing and gave it legitimacy.''         Since that first class of scholars, more than 1,200 women have been given fellowships at the institute, including the author Alice Walker, the psychologist Carol Gilligan; former Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont; the poets Anne Sexton and Sophie Cabot Black; the performance artist Anna Deavere Smith; the anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, and the geophysicist and astronaut Marcia McNutt.         After Mrs. Bunting-Smith stepped down as president of Radcliffe in 1972, she spent three years as special assistant to the president of Princeton University, William Bowen, working on coeducation there.         In 1979, she married Dr. Clement A. Smith, a pediatrician and faculty member at Harvard. He died in 1988.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith is survived by three sons, Charles I. Bunting of Shelbourne, Vt., William H. Bunting of North Whitefield, Me., and John E. Bunting of New Boston, N.H.; a daughter, Mary B. Decher of Bellevue, Wash; three stepdaughters,  Pamela Smith of Harvard, Me., Gail Smith Biggar of Concord, Mass., and Hilary Smith of Peacham, Vt.; a stepson, Reynolds Smith of Harvard, Me.; a sister, Winifred I. Warner of Laurel Hollow, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Alma Hawkins, a pioneering modern-dance educator who founded the dance department at the University of California at Los Angeles, died on Jan. 8 at her home in Santa Monica. She was 94.         Born in Rolla, Mo., Dr. Hawkins graduated from the University of Missouri and went on to study at Teachers College, Columbia University, where she became interested in modern dance. She trained in dance at Bennington College and in Colorado before earning master's and doctor's degrees at Columbia.         She taught at Emporia State University in Kansas and George Williams College in Chicago before joining the dance program at U.C.L.A.; she was its chairwoman from 1953 to her retirement in 1977.         In 1962, Dr. Hawkins established an autonomous dance department, equal in status to the departments of art, music and theater arts, at the College of Fine Arts at the university.         According to the University of California at Los Angeles, it was the nation's first university dance department, eventually offering degrees in dance therapy, dance history, esthetics and education as well as choreography and performance.         Dr. Hawkins encouraged the establishment of an interdepartmental program in ethnic arts that later became the world arts and cultures program. She worked closely with dance presenters to bring leading American and foreign troupes to perform at Royce Hall at the university.         In 1967, she formed the Council of Dance Administrators, a product of a national conference on dance sponsored by the arts and humanities division of the United States Office of Education.         The council published ''Standards for Dance Major Programs'' of colleges in 1979, leading to a national dance certification program. Also in 1967, Dr. Hawkins founded the West Coast Dance Film Archives. She later founded the national Council of Graduate Dance/Movement Therapy Educators.         Dr. Hawkins was a dance therapist and researcher at the university's Neuropsychiatric Institute from 1960 to 1977, training dance therapists and creating a series of educational research films about the field. On her retirement from U.C.L.A., Dr. Hawkins taught for more than 10 years in the dance department at Santa Monica College.         She is survived by her sister, Alice Hawkins of Santa Monica, Calif.       
         Helen Wills Moody, arguably the most dominant tennis player of the 20th century and the first American-born woman to achieve international celebrity as an athlete, died Thursday at a convalescent home in Carmel, Calif.         She was 92 and had been in failing health for several years.         She was affectionately but accurately known as Little Miss Poker Face for her dispassionate on-court behavior. Wills, who never appeared for a match without her signature stark white visor, won 31 Grand Slam titles in her 15 years of competition. She held the No. 1 world ranking for eight years and did not lose a set while amassing a 180-match winning streak from 1927 to 1933.         Match points for or against her often passed unnoticed by Wills, a  product of her legendary concentration. According to her biographer Larry Engelman, she adhered to a simple mantra during the match: ''Every shot, every shot, every shot.''         She won the first of her 19 Grand Slam singles titles as a pigtailed 17-year-old in 1923 at the national championships in Forest Hills, N.Y. Bothered by back pain and a disinclination to turn professional, she retired from tennis altogether in 1938 after winning a record eighth Wimbledon title at age 32. That record remained until 1990, when Martina Navratilova captured her ninth singles championship at Wimbledon.         Wills followed the game closely in her later years, watching matches on television, and she seemed never to have lost her competitive edge. ''She admired Martina Navratilova greatly as a tennis player who broke her record,'' said Jeanne Cherry, a Los Angeles tennis historian. ''I once asked her how she felt about Martina breaking her record, and she said, 'Well, you know, she pumps iron.' ''         No less a champion than Don Budge, 11 years her junior, called Wills ''one of my idols.''         Like Moody, Budge was born in California's Bay area. ''I remember riding to Berkeley on my bicycle to watch her practice,'' he said yesterday from his home in Dingmans Ferry, Pa.         In addition to her eight Wimbledon singles titles, Wills captured seven United States singles titles, won the French championships four times and earned gold medals in singles and doubles at the 1924 Olympics. Moody also won 12 United States, French and Wimbledon doubles and mixed doubles titles with eight different partners.         Budge was one of those who teamed with her in mixed doubles.  ''She hit the ball harder than most, except maybe Steffi Graf,'' Budge said. ''Her footwork didn't have to be great. She would control the play because she hit the ball so hard.''         Stalwart from the baseline but unafraid of ambushing her rivals at the net, Wills was less a ruthless opponent than an indefatigable one. Like her flamboyant European role model, Suzanne Lenglen, Wills used men as her practice partners, the better to overpower her contemporaries.         Reclusive by nature and dubbed the Garbo of the tennis tour by Alice Marble, one of the many opponents who felt ignored by her, Wills nonetheless lived a most public and, at times, storybook existence. Renowned for her Greek profile as well as her intimidating athletic prowess, she took tea with the British Prime Minister, was the subject of poetry by Louis Untermeyer and counted King Gustaf V of Sweden and Charlie Chaplin among her admirers. In 1930 Chaplin described ''the movement of Helen Wills playing tennis'' as the most beautiful sight he had ever seen.         Wills was an artist by avocation. She received a degree in fine arts along with a Phi Beta Kappa key from the University of California, and painted throughout her life. She was delighted to be chosen as the model for Diego Rivera's two-story mural ''The Riches of California,'' commissioned for $2,500 in 1930. Wills and the first of her two husbands, the financier Frederick Moody, invited Rivera and his wife, the painter Frieda Kahlo, to a celebratory tea after the mural's unveiling at the former San Francisco Stock Exchange.         For Wills, who confessed to suffering the intangible pangs of ''a restless heart,'' tennis and painting were the best antidotes for melancholy. She maintained an artist's studio at her residences in San Francisco and later in Carmel, once sold 40 paintings for $100 each and illustrated her own articles for The Saturday Evening Post.         Wills also became a champion of fashion, particularly on the tennis court. Like the exotic Lenglen, the first of a new breed of female tennis players who abandoned the long skirts dictated by the era, Wills advocated sensible garb on the courts and blamed trailing hemlines for women's ineptitude at the net. She termed them ''a mental as well as a physical hazard'' and always wore a knee-length pleated skirt during play.         Born in Centerville, Calif., on Oct. 6, 1905, Wills spent her childhood in Berkeley and received her initial tennis tutelage from her father, Dr. Clarence Wills. For her 14th birthday, her parents gave her a membership in the Berkeley Tennis Club, where a volunteer coach, William Fuller, arranged daily matches for her. Wills was a bit of a fanatic, playing every day and bent on defeating every opponent. At 15, on her first attempt, she won the national junior championship in 1921.         Just two years later, at 17, she became the second-youngest United States national champion by dethroning Molla Mallory, the defending champion. Wills began a lengthy tenure at the top by receiving the No. 1 Unites States ranking after their match at Forest Hills.         She went to Europe for the first time in 1924, and lost the Wimbledon final to Britain's top player, Kitty McKane. But after that auspicious debut, she prevailed in all eight of her other Wimbledon finals.         Perhaps Wills's most infamous match, and certainly the one she extolled as the focal point of her playing career, was her only meeting with Lenglen, the queen of the continent, in a much ballyhooed showdown at Cannes in 1926. Lenglen was 26 and tactically superior; Wills was 20 and physically stronger. Lenglen won the raucous encounter, 6-3, 8-6.         There was a prizefight atmosphere, with tickets scalped at a then-shocking rate of $50 each, and an international gallery of spectators that included King Gustaf, a group of stowaway French schoolboys in a eucalyptus tree at one end of the court and Wills's future husband, Frederick Moody, who introduced himself to her after the match. Wills was fond of noting that although she lost the match, she not only gained perspective on necessary changes to her game, which tended to be without nuance and relied on battering her opponents into submission with repetitious forehand ground strokes, but also gained a husband. She and Moody divorced in 1937, and she married Aidan Roark, a film writer and noted polo player, two years later. She leaves no survivors.         ''Whatever Helen did, she had to be the best at it,'' said Edward Chandler, a San Francisco attorney who was a lifelong friend of Wills. ''She never really seemed to replace tennis. She stopped playing at 82, but she was outspoken in her admiration for Chris Evert, she despised Jimmy Connors for the way he behaved and she was very happy to see Pete Sampras come along, because he seemed a throwback to the older school.''       
         Lia Manoliu, a worldly woman who threw the discus for Romania in six Olympic Games and won the gold medal in 1968, died on Friday in a hospital in Bucharest. She was 65.         Hospital officials said the cause was a heart attack. They said she went into a coma on Dec. 31 during surgery for a brain tumor and never regained consciousness.         In 1990, after the revolution that unseated the repressive Government of Nicolae Ceausescu, Manoliu was named president of the Romanian Olympic Committee. She was only the third woman to head a national Olympic committee, following Princess Anne in Britain and Princess Nora in Liechtenstein.         Manoliu was a finalist in every Olympics from 1952 through 1972. She was the discus bronze medalist in 1960 in Rome (171 feet 9 inches). She won a bronze in 1964 in Tokyo (186-10) and a gold in Mexico City in 1968 (191-2). Then 36, she was the oldest woman to win an Olympic title in track and field. In 1972, when she was 40, she made the longest throw of her career, 203-7.         She was fluent in French, English, German and Russian. In earlier years, she was an electrical engineer who studied the effects of light and noise on factory workers. Her intellectual pursuits were endless, and she often seemed to apologize for them. In a 1971 interview in The New York Times, Brian Glanville wrote, ''She has on her bookshelves the works of Sartre, Ibsen, Pirandello and Wilde.'' To which she responded:         ''It's not me. It's the tradition in the family. My father was a professor of philosophy. That's how I had this mania to read.''         Once, in Munich, she asked a Bavarian track official about visiting a local art gallery.         ''He was amazed that someone who had been practicing a sport for 20 years should want to do that,'' she recalled. ''I felt a little humiliated. You have sport imprinted on your forehead.''         A Romanian who had known her since she was a young athlete once said, ''She has this immense compulsion to take the sins of all athletes on her shoulders.''         As an athlete, she was almost 6 feet and 187 pounds. She trained hard, sometimes jumping with 300 pounds on her back.         ''If I don't work for a month,'' she said, ''my form gets worse and worse. I have a friend, Mihaela Penes'' -- a Romanian who won the women's javelin throw in the 1964 Olympics -- ''who's endowed by nature. If she has a year's rest, it's just the same. If I stop for a month, I fall away. I wasn't gifted with this physical strength. I had to work for it all. For those moments of success, it's worth the price.''         There were other prices, too.         After she won her Olympic gold medal, her husband, Aurel Naicu, who had limited success as a discus thrower and coach, bought an expensive American car in Mexico City and sent it to Bucharest. There, he drove away with a young girlfriend. Soon after, Manoliu and her husband were divorced. They had no children.         ''I was a little in despair,'' she said, ''after 10 years of marriage.''       
         Dr. Jean Trepp McKelvey, who hurdled gender barriers in the field of labor-management mediation and opened the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, died on Jan. 5 at the Kirkhaven Nursing Home in her hometown of Rochester. She was 89.         She taught at Sarah Lawrence College for 13 years until 1946, when Cornell formed the new branch on its Ithaca, N.Y., campus and appointed her as its first faculty member. She wrote the curriculum for the school and taught courses in arbitration, labor law and labor practices.         She assumed emeritus status in 1976 but continued to teach and coordinate the school's off-campus graduate credit courses given under extension programs in Albany, Corning, Elmira, Rochester and Syracuse. In a tribute to her and another faculty member, the school, known by its initials, I.L.R., established its first endowed chair in 1994 and named it the Jean McKelvey-Alice Grant Professorship of Labor Management Relations.         Many of her former students went on to fill influential positions as union leaders, arbitrators and jurists. The year after she arrived at Cornell, she became a charter member -- and the sole woman at the time -- in the National Academy of Arbitrators. In 1970, she was the first woman to be elected president of the academy and, mindful of the overwhelming preponderance of men in her metier, came up with an arbitration training program for women.         Outside the classroom, Dr. McKelvey was a sought-after arbitrator for the airline industry as well as other sectors of the economy. Gov. W. Averell Harriman named her to the  State Board of Mediation in 1955, and she served on it for 11 years, helping settle thorny disputes like a wholesale butchers' strike in 1961.         President Richard M. Nixon appointed her to the Federal Services Impasses Panel in 1970, and she remained on it until eight years ago. At her death, she was still a member of the Public Review Board of the United Automobile Workers.         She was the author of many papers and books and edited the proceedings of several annual meetings of the National Academy of Arbitrators. Among her books were ''Cleared for Takeoff: Airline Labor Relations Since Deregulation'' (I.L.R. Press, 1988), ''The Changing Law of Fair Representation'' (I.L.R., 1985), ''New Challenges to Arbitration'' (I.L.R., 1977) and ''A.F.L. Attitudes Toward Production, 1900-1932'' (Greenwood, 1974).         She was born Jean Trepp in St. Louis and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley College in 1929. She received her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Radcliffe College in 1931 and 1933 and joined the Sarah Lawrence faculty in the year between. During World War II, she was a hearing officer and arbitrator for the National War Labor Board.         She is survived by her husband of 63 years, Blake McKelvey, Rochester's city historian emeritus, and a brother, Richard Trepp of Springfield, Mass.       
         Helen Haje, a Washington public relations woman who championed Arab-American interests with such good-natured fervor that she became gadfly and godmother to the Arab-American movement in the United States, died on Monday at a hospital near her home in Washington. She was 74.         Her family said the cause was congestive heart failure.         The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, Mrs. Haje, who grew up in Altoona, Pa., and married a local Lebanese-American businessman, seemed content with her role as an  American housewife and mother.         But when her husband, Albert, died at the age of 33 in the early 1940's, leaving her with three young children, she pulled up stakes, moved to Washington and went to work, first as a secretary for Catholic Charities and later as an independent public relations woman.         Had it not been for the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and a resulting wave of  Arab stereotypes that swept the United States, Mrs. Haje might have remained a conventional public relations woman, representing commercial and other clients.         In a land of immigrants where ethnic and national societies abound, there had been virtually no Arab-American organizations in the United States, but in the wake of the 1967 war, many prominent Arab-Americans saw the need for a concerted effort both to counter the demonizing stereotypes and to lobby for policies favorable to their often-embattled homelands.         Through her long work with the Saints Peter and Paul Antiochian Orthodox Church in Bethesda, Md., Mrs. Haje had gotten to know and impress many of Washington's leading Arab-American figures, and in 1972 when a group of them formed the National Association of Arab-Americans as the first political Arab-American organization, Mrs. Haje suddenly found herself in the forefront of a movement.         Volunteering to become the group's first executive secretary, she operated the organization for its first few years, first from her home and later at a small office.         Although it was her typing skills that most benefited the organization in its formative stages, the association's founders, many of them unfamiliar with the ways of Washington, soon found her public relations expertise even more valuable.         Over the next years, Mrs. Hafe, a gregarious woman with a wide circle of friends and a bulging file of telephone numbers, continually amazed Arab-American leaders and visiting Arab diplomats with the ease with which she could put them in touch with journalists and newscasters, many of whom were, in turn, equally amazed with the ease with which she could ferret out and secure them interviews with obscure Arab officials or Arab-American scholars, lawyers and business leaders.         Mrs. Haje did not know every one of the estimated three million Arab-Americans in the United States. It just sometimes seemed she did. Although Lebanese-Americans, who account for a third of the total, are the most populous Arab group in the United States, Mrs. Haje recognized and celebrated the common bond among Americans from Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Iraq and other Arab counties.         Mrs. Haje, who also served as a bridge between Arab-American organizations, eventually worked so closely with so many of them, including the Arab-American Discrimination Committee and the Arab-American University Graduates Association, that Dr. Clovis Maksud, the Lebanese-born former head of the Arab League, called her the ''mother'' of most of the Arab-American organizations in the United States.         ''At a moment of great despair among Arab-Americans,'' Dr. Maksud said yesterday, ''she helped mobilize and organize the community.''         For all her devotion to her ancestral home in Lebanon and to other Arab countries, Mrs. Haje was a thoroughgoing American who emphasized the need for Arab-American leaders to criticize their homelands' governments when their actions warranted it.         Her survivors include two sons, Charles, of Destin, Fla., and Albert Jr., of Washington; a daughter, Sharyn Corry of Middleburg, Va.; two sisters, four brothers and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Gertrude Scharff Goldhaber, a physicist who contributed to scientists' understanding of nuclear fission and the structure of atomic nuclei, died on Monday at Brookhaven Memorial Hospital in Patchogue, N.Y. She was 86 and lived at Bayport on Long Island.         Dr. Goldhaber was a member of the National Academy of Sciences and retired as a senior scientist at Brookhaven National Laboratory.         She was credited with the discovery that spontaneous fission is associated with the emission of neutrons. She made that observation in 1942 when she was a research physicist at the University of Illinois, but it was classified top secret and not announced until after World War II.         Dr. Goldhaber added to the knowledge of the structure of the nucleus when she found regularities in nuclear excited states. She also worked in areas that included long-lived isomers (different versions of elements) and heavy ions (positively and negatively charged atoms or molecules).         In 1948, she and her husband, Dr. Maurice Goldhaber, determined that  beta rays were identical with electrons, which settled an argument among their peers.         She was elected a fellow of the American Physics Society in 1947 and the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1980, and to membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1972.         Born in Mannheim, Germany, she earned a doctoral degree at the University of Munich in 1935 and moved to England to do research at Imperial College in London.         She did research and taught at the University of Illinois from 1939 to 1950, when she became the first woman with a Ph.D. in physics on the Brookhaven faculty.         Dr. Goldhaber founded the Brookhaven Lecture Series in 1960. She was a co-founder of Brookhaven Women in Science, which furthers the advancement of women scientists and began in 1979. She retired from Brookhaven in 1977 but returned in 1985 as a research collaborator, an association she continued until 1990.         Over the years, she was an adjunct professor at Cornell University and the Johns Hopkins University. She also was an adviser and consultant  at the National Research Council, the National Science Foundation and many other scientific bodies.         Besides her husband of 59 years, she is survived by two sons, both theoretical physicists, Dr. Alfred Goldhaber of Setauket, N.Y., and Dr. Michael Goldhaber of Oakland, Calif.; a sister, Liselotte Leoni of Nice, France, and two grandchildren.         In 1984, the Phi Beta Kappa society selected her as a Visiting Scholar, an honor that sent her to eight campuses for the year. In an interview at the time with The New York Times, she said that her path into science had been clear because she fell in love with numbers at the age of 4 and decided to study physics and mathematics as a teen-ager in Munich.         She declined to settle for the future of a high school teacher, as other  girls with similar interests might have, or a lawyer, as her father wanted, she said.         ''I said, 'I'm not interested in the law,' '' she recalled. ''I wanted to understand what the world is made of. That actually turned out to be a good thing because when the Nazis came -- I'm Jewish -- I had to leave the country, and physics was something that could be done anywhere.''       
         Edith Oliver, a diminutive, raspy-voiced and highly influential drama critic at The New Yorker for more than three decades who got her start writing questions for radio quiz shows, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         ''She was packaged like the quintessential elderly lady that a Boy Scout would help across the street, except that she drank martinis, smoked cigarettes and could, on occasion, have a mouth like a sailor,'' said George White, chairman and founder of the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center, where Miss Oliver served as a dramaturge for 20 seasons at its National Playwrights Conference in Waterford, Conn. ''She could be tough and would brook no banality, but she truly loved playwrights and loved the theater.''         Born in New York to parents she later described as ''stage-struck,'' Miss Oliver remembered seeing her first show at the age of 5. After attending Smith College, she studied acting at the Berkshire Playhouse in Stockbridge, Mass., and began performing on radio shows, including ''Gangbusters,'' ''Crime Doctor'' and the ''Philip Morris Playhouse.''         From 1937 until 1941, she wrote the radio quiz show ''True or False?,'' and for a dozen years, beginning in 1940, she wrote and eventually also produced ''Take It or Leave It: The $64 Question.''         Miss Oliver began contributing to The New Yorker in 1947 and joined the staff in 1961 as a movie and theater critic, eventually becoming among the most influential voices covering Off Broadway theater.         ''Off Broadway was the love of my life,'' she said in a 1992 interview. ''I was young enough to be all over town, four or five nights a week. The thrill was Harlem in the 60's, for the music and the theater.''         She also ran the magazine's book department for many years, while continuing to write.         ''She was a person of great wit, great sardonic and satiric wit and yet very generous at the same time,'' said Lloyd Richards, the veteran stage director and longtime artistic director of the National Playwrights Conference. ''You didn't puff yourself up in front of Edith. She could prick the balloon.''         In 1987 she began to share the coverage of Broadway shows for The New Yorker, first with Mimi Kramer and then with John Lahr. She retired in 1992. But for three more years, Miss Oliver continued to take part in the summer conference at the O'Neill Center, where she was a feisty and sometimes profane figure.         Despite her frank language, Miss Oliver said she would never allow any coarseness to sneak into her New Yorker copy. ''I can't compromise the magazine's standards of civility,'' she once said.         Woodie King, artistic director at the New Federal Theater, said, ''For our first 15 years of existence, she covered all of our productions and gave us and other theater groups a visibility that we would not have had otherwise.''         He added: ''She always supported innovative writing. Even late in life, when it was difficult for her to get around, you would always see her there.''         She is survived by a brother, Robert Goldsmith of Harwich, Mass.         During a 1989 critics' roundtable in Manhattan, Miss Oliver described her approach to her work. ''I think of myself as a member of the audience,'' she said. ''And I try to maintain that attitude until the curtain comes down. I don't want to deprive myself of any surprises.''         She could be very hard on playwrights, but told an interviewer that she tried always to be gentle with actors.         ''I have the greatest sympathy for actors and their problems,'' she said. ''They don't need me to add to their burden.''       
         Margaret Hillis, who founded the Chicago Symphony Chorus and was the first woman to conduct the Chicago Symphony itself, died yesterday at Evanston Hospital, in Evanston, Ill. She was 76, and lived in Wilmette, Ill.         The cause was lung cancer, said Synneve Carlino, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Symphony.         Ms. Hillis, who appeared as a guest conductor with many American orchestras, including the National Symphony, the St. Louis Symphony, the Oregon Symphony and the Minnesota Orchestra, often said that orchestral conducting was her first love. She established herself as a choral conductor, however, because there were virtually no orchestral conducting opportunities for women when she began her career in the 1950's.         ''I learned to take a strong disadvantage and turn it to my advantage,'' she once said, and indeed, her work with the Chicago Symphony Chorus, as well as the choruses of the San Francisco Symphony and the Cleveland Orchestra, brought her considerable renown.         It also helped smooth her path to orchestral podiums. In 1957, when she started her chorus in Chicago, she made her conducting debut with the Chicago Symphony. She led the orchestra several times thereafter, both in Chicago and on tour         In 1977, she had a notable appearance as a last-minute substitute for Sir Georg Solti, who had fallen ill, in a performance of Mahler's Eighth Symphony at Carnegie Hall.         Ms. Hillis was born in Kokomo, Ind., in 1921. She began studying the piano when she was 5, but said that by the time she was 8 she began dreaming of becoming a conductor. She studied music at Indiana University in Bloomington, but suspended her studies during World War II to become a civilian flight instructor in Muncie, Ind.         After she completed her bachelor's degree in 1947, Ms. Hillis moved to New York, where she studied choral conducting with Robert Shaw at the Juilliard School. She soon became Mr. Shaw's assistant at the Collegiate Chorale, and in 1950 she founded the Tanglewood Alumni Chorus, which later performed as the New York Concert Choir and Orchestra.         In the 1950's she also worked as a choral conductor for the New York City Opera and the American Opera Society. During her years in New York she taught choral conducting at the Juilliard School and Union Theological Seminary, and she formed the American Choral Foundation, an organization that sought to raise the standards of choral performance.         The conductor Fritz Reiner invited her to start a chorus for the Chicago Symphony in 1957, and within a decade she had established one of the finest professional choirs in the country.         She also began working with community and regional orchestras, and was director for several years of the Kenosha Civic Orchestra, the Chicago Civic Orchestra and the Elgin Symphony. Starting in the late 1970's, she worked more actively as a guest conductor.         Although the directors of orchestral choirs do most of their work behind the scenes, rehearsing their choruses for performances conducted by the orchestra's music director or a guest conductor, Ms. Hillis's work with the Chicago Symphony Chorus was widely praised. She received Grammy awards for nine recordings for which she prepared the chorus for Mr. Solti, among them a Verdi Requiem, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, two recordings of the Brahms German Requiem, Haydn's ''Creation'' and Bach's Mass in B minor.         Ms. Hillis is survived by three brothers: Elwood Hillis, a former Congressman, of Culver, Ind; Robert Hillis of Kokomo, and Joseph Hillis of Lafayette, Calif.         She had a sense of humor about her struggle for recognition in a profession dominated by men. ''There's only one woman I know who could never be a symphony conductor,'' she told The New York Times in 1979, ''and that's the Venus de Milo.''       
         Dr. Mary Catherine Raugust Howell, a pediatrician who championed medical careers and better health care for women and who was the first woman to become an associate dean at Harvard Medical School, died yesterday at her home in Watertown, Mass. She was 65.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Dr. Howell attracted the attention of a male-dominated establishment in 1973 with an ironically titled critique of the status quo, ''Why Would a Girl Go into Medicine? Medical Education in the United States: A Guide for Women'' (Feminist Press). Since Dr. Howell was a Harvard associate dean at the time, she decided to publish it under the pen name Margaret A. Campbell.         Her study of discrimination against women in medical schools, she declared in her foreword, was written ''to inform and encourage women medical students of the past, present and future and to promote radical change in medical education and in the care of patients.''         While quotas were not acknowledged in the admissions offices of medical schools, she wrote, practice suggested otherwise. A ''man doctor, woman nurse'' mentality reigned, she said, and with it the attitude that it was imprudent to waste expensive medical school training on a woman if she was unlikely to practice the profession because of marriage and  motherhood.         Dr. Howell acknowledged authorship of the book a few years later.  Her facts and figures were used as  ammunition by many groups pressing to gain a fairer role for women in the medical field. The prospects of women in medicine were eventually enhanced by Federal legislation against sex discrimination.         Dr. Howell was also active in the women's health movement. She was  a founding member of the National Women's Health Network, which was formed in the 1970's to lobby for better health care for women.         ''By 1975,'' said Cynthia Pearson, the network's executive director, ''there were over 2,000 community-based women's health groups that either provided direct services and education and an alternative to traditional male-dominated medical care or were engaged in efforts to change the system. Mary helped organize the first national women's health conference, which brought individual women and representatives of grass-roots women's health groups to the Harvard campus.''         Dr. Howell also contributed to Working Mother magazine and to ''Our Bodies, Ourselves: A Book by and for Women'' from the Boston Women's Book Collective, whose 25th anniversary update was published by Touchstone in 1996.         Mary Catherine Raugust was born on Sept. 2, 1932, in Grand Forks, N. D., the daughter of a businessman and a former public-school teacher. She graduated from Radcliffe College in 1954, studied linguistics and originally wanted to become a musician. She married Robert Jordan of Weston, Conn., and had a son, Nicholas, but the marriage failed. She then decided to become a pediatrician.         ''She started to think she wanted to care for kids and went into pre-med,'' said Samuel Howell, her son by a second marriage. ''She was always very concerned about children and the institutional way in which medicine treats them. She fought against that all her life, trying to de-institutionalize medicine.''         In interviews later in her life, Dr. Howell told of the slights, condescension, jokes and outright hostility she endured as a medical student and intern from school administrators, faculty members and male students. Even female patients often feared that a female doctor was inherently inferior, Dr. Howell said.         But, persisting, she earned a Ph.D. in developmental psychology and an M.D. at the University of Minnesota in 1962; she earned a doctor of laws degree at Harvard University in 1991.         Dr. Howell trained in pediatrics, psychotherapy, bioethics and geriatrics at various institutions as she pursued her career as a practicing doctor and educator, starting as an instructor in child development at Minnesota in 1962. She joined the faculty of Harvard Medical School as an instructor in pediatrics in 1969, rising to become an assistant professor of pediatrics and chief of the behavior unit in the Children's Service of the Massachusetts General Hospital.         Dr. Howell was appointed associate dean for student affairs in 1972, becoming the highest-ranking woman at the medical school at the time, and served until 1975. She viewed her appointment as a kind of tokenism.         ''Prior to my appointment,'' she said in an interview in 1979, ''a committee of students and faculty had asserted the need for a woman administrator, and Harvard got tremendous mileage out of my appointment. Student affairs are traditionally places where your job is to keep students quiet and out of everyone's hair. The administration expected us to act as student pacifiers rather than student advocates.''         Shortly after her appointment, Dr. Howell sent out questionnaires to female medical students throughout  the country, asking them about their status and attitudes toward them. Their responses reminded her of her own painful journey to become a doctor, she said, and she decided to use them as the basis for what became her book for Feminist Press.         After leaving Harvard in 1975, she had a pediatric practice in York, Me.,  for a year. Based on her experiences there, she wrote another book, ''Healing at Home: A Guide to Health Care for Children'' (Beacon Press, 1978) She returned to the Boston area to practice pediatrics and psychotherapy.         From 1992 to 1994, she was a member of the Division of Medical Ethics at Harvard Medical School.         Dr. Howell's second marriage, to Dr. A. Ervin Howell of Fairmont, Minn., ended in divorce.         In addition to her sons Nicholas Jordan, of Weston, Conn., and Samuel Howell, of Manhattan, she is survived by three other sons, Aaron Howell, of Medford, Mass., Eli Howell, of Eugene, Ore., and Ned Raugust, of Concord, Mass.; two daughters, Sarah Howell, of Framingham, Mass., and Eve Howell, of Boston; a brother, Tony Raugust of Minneapolis, and one granddaughter.       
         Marje Fields, a longtime talent agent who was a pioneer in placing well-known actors in television commercials, died on Jan. 27 at her home in Manhattan. She was 77.         Among the clients represented at one time by her agency, Marje Fields Inc., were John Travolta, Ted Danson, Nancy Walker, Edward Hermann, Barry Bostwick and Hal Linden. While Ms. Fields, whose married name was Karp, concentrated on the television advertising, side of the business, others in her office also represented some of their clients for theatrical productions.         While president of the National Association of Talent Representatives, Ms. Fields led a three-year legal battle to end the licensing of talent agents by actors' unions and the payment of franchise fees by agents to the unions.         That effort eventually led to a 1981 ruling by the United States Supreme Court. The union practice of requiring members to work only for talent agents the union had licensed was deemed to be constitutional, and not a violation of anti-trust laws, as Ms. Fields's group had argued.         But the justices were split on the legality of the franchise fees, which unions -- Actors' Equity, the Screen Actors Guild and the American Federation of Television and Radio artists -- had required licensed agents to pay to them. The fees were eventually discontinued by the unions.         Ms. Fields began her career at the Air Features agency, later moving to the Charles B. Tranum Agency, where she became a leader in the then-new concept of placing famous actors in television commercials.         In 1971, she formed her own agency, which closed in 1994 when she retired. She married Oscar Karp, owner of Oscar's Salt of the Sea restaurant in Manhattan, in 1983. Mr. Karp died in 1986.       
         Rene  de Epelbaum, a founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo human rights group and one of its most dynamic members, died on Saturday at age 77.         Her colleagues said she had suffered a heart attack.         In 1977, during its crackdown on leftists, the military dictatorship that ran Argentina at the time abducted her three adult children, Luis, Lila, and Claudio, and presumably killed them. Mrs. Epelbaum offered her home as a meeting place for mothers who had suffered the same plight.         Soon after, in open defiance of the junta, the group of mothers began holding weekly protests in the main Government square, the Plaza de Mayo. Today, the protests at the Plaza de Mayo are still held every Thursday as the elderly mothers don their trademark white head scarfs with the names of missing children scrawled in ink.         A Government commission found in the mid-1980's that at least 9,000 people had been killed or disappeared during the right-wing military Government's crackdown on political opponents. Human rights advocates contend that the number of victims was closer to 30,000.         Mrs. Epelbaum, who once taught literature, was a fearless, outspoken critic of the military Government. Her writings, speeches, and trips abroad helped earn the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo international acclaim. She also is credited with bringing worldwide attention to the atrocities of Argentina's military regime, which reliquinshed power in 1983.         ''I remember the first time she gave a press conference in Canada and spoke against the dictatorship,'' said Laura Bonaparte, another member of her group. ''They told her to be careful because she could be killed when she returned to Argentina. Epelbaum replied: 'What is important to me is what we do today, not what will happen tommorrow.' ''         Mrs. Epelbaum was greatly troubled by President Carlos Saul Menem's decision in 1989 to pardon senior military officers accused of human rights abuses. The democratically elected Government said the move was essential for national reconciliation.         ''It is a true moral aberration that leaves in liberty those who violated human dignity and those who rose up against the constitutional order,'' Mrs. Epelbaum said.         Alfredo Bravo, an opposition Congressman whose party has proposed a bill to rescind the military amnesty, said of Mrs. Epelbaum, who leaves no immediate survivors, ''It hurts me deeply that as a Congressman, I have not been able to repair her pain, at least in part, with the abolition of these amnesty decrees.''       
         Helen Billings Burnham, a one-time real estate woman with no legal training who spent 22 years dispensing justice, sometimes from her family room, as a part-time, round-the-clock town justice in Salina, N.Y., died on Thursday at her home in Mattydale, a suburb of Syracuse. She was 81 and had retired in 1993.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         As a judge who never went to law school, Mrs. Burnham was hardly an anomaly. Only about a quarter of New York's 2,000 or so local court judges have law degrees.         Even so, when the Salina town board named her to succeed her husband, Richard, as town justice after he was killed in a motorcycle accident in 1971, there were those who thought she did not belong on the bench. Her husband's friends, she recalled, told her it was not a job for a lady. After all, although town justices mainly handle traffic offenses and small claims disputes, perform wedding ceremonies and preside over misdemeanor cases involving penalties of no more than a year in jail, those who are hauled into court are rarely the most reputable of citizens. And the duties of a town justice also include arraigning accused murderers and other desperate felony suspects, sometimes in the middle of the night.         Mrs. Burnham, a large, imposing woman who had run her own real estate business and served as her husband's clerk during his nine years as town justice, was not intimidated.         ''I became a judge and stopped being a lady,'' she said.         The appointment, which made her the 16th woman to serve as judge in New York and the first in Onondaga County, was not popular with her husband's Republican allies.         At the end of the year, when the Republicans named a man to run in a special election to fill out her husband's term, Mrs. Burnham felt miffed enough to leave the Republican Party but not enough to become an actual Democrat. So she blithely switched her enrollment to the Conservative Party, picked up the gleeful endorsement of local Democrats and won the election.         After that, neither the Republicans nor anybody else bothered to put up a candidate against her. Running unopposed, she won five more four-year terms.         A native of Earlville, N.Y., Mrs. Burnham attended the Utica School of Commerce and moved to Mattydale, a Salina hamlet, in 1952 when her husband, who was a lawyer, took a job with an insurance company in Syracuse before starting a private practice there.         By the time of her husband's death, Mrs. Burnham had spent enough time in his courtroom, an attached garage that had been converted to a family room, to know pretty much what to expect.         Over the next two decades she dispensed justice with such consistent compassion, good humor and common sense that in 1989 the National Judges Association named her the outstanding non-attorney judge in the United States.         Shortly before she became town justice, Salina had provided a courtroom in the municipal office building, but except for scheduled traffic court evenings and the like, until she closed it in 1980, Mrs. Burnham performed most of her part-time judicial duties at her real estate office.         But as a town justice on call 24 hours a day, she did not bother to redecorate the old family room.         In a sequence that became a familiar drill, Mrs. Burnham would be awakened by a midnight call from the sheriff's office, get out of bed, slip her black judicial robe over her nightgown and be ready, gavel in hand, when the latest felony suspect was brought in for arraignment.         For all her work on criminal cases, Mrs. Burnham was best known for her weddings.         She performed more than 3,000 marriage ceremonies, earning the nickname ''the marrying judge,'' in part because when it came to marriage, Mrs. Burnham was a judicial romantic who would go just about anywhere anytime in the cause of Cupid.         Over the years, she presided at poolside weddings, one in an airplane, another on horseback and on more than a few occasions at hospital maternity wards a few contractions ahead of the bride's baby.         After she stepped down as town justice, Mrs. Burnham was named Salina's town historian and produced two books, one a history of Mattydale, and the other, ''The Room on the Side of the House,'' an account of her judicial experiences.         A fun-loving, outspoken woman who learned to curb her tongue during her years on the bench, Mrs. Burnham relished her retirement.         ''Now I'm not a judge or a lady,'' she said. ''I can say and do whatever I want to.''         She is survived by two sons, Richard of Virginia Beach, Va., and William of Cicero, N.Y.; four daughters, Jeanne Steffanelli of Portsmouth, Va., Linda Bamberger of Mattydale and Candice Jost and Cynthia Morris of Syracuse; 15 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.       
         Countess Anthony Szapary, the doyenne of Newport society and the great-great-granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt who lived a good part of the year on the upper floors of  the Breakers, maintaining the family's presence in the 70-room mansion built by her grandparents, died on Sunday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 79.         The Countess had suffered a stroke at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y., her family said.         The former Sylvia Anita Gabriel Denise Irene Marie Szechenyi (pronounced sa-CHAIN-ee) was one of five daughters of Count Lazlo Szechenyi and Gladys Moore Vanderbilt Szechenyi. Her father was the first minister from Hungary to the United States and later served at the Court of St. James. Her mother was the daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt 2d, who built the Breakers as the family's summer home.         The house, designed by Richard Morris Hunt and covering more than an acre of the 11-acre estate, was modeled after Renaissance palaces in Turin and Genoa, and was finished in 1895. The mansion, which, with furnishings costing $7 million, was one of the Gilded Age estates referred to by their owners at the time as cottages.         The Breakers was maintained as a private residence until 1947 when it was leased to the Preservation Society of Newport County for $1 a year. The maintenance and the taxes were paid by Countess Szechenyi until her death in 1965. The society bought the property in 1972, but Countess Szapary (pronounced sa-PAR-ee) continued to live in rooms on the third floor, and her devotion to the Breakers endured to the end of her life, officials of the society said yesterday. The original furnishings were not included in the sale of the property, but over the years Countess Szechenyi's descendants gave most of them to the society.         Countess Szapary, who was known as Syvie to her friends, was a lively woman with strong opinions, an impish sense of humor and an adventurous spirit. As a child, she used a large silver tray to toboggan down the impressive staircase at the Breakers, a tradition that younger members of the Vanderbilt family are said to have carried on. She also rode her bicycle at breakneck speed around the great hall, and during World War II, when the house was shuttered, she maintained, tongue in cheek, that she kept America safe through her volunteer work as a plane spotter on the roof of a boys school in Newport.         In her later years, after the Breakers was opened to tourists (who were always called guests, at her insistence), she would occasionally join the tour group, casually dressed, her identity unknown, and correct the guides if she believed they had made a mistake.         Born in Remete, in Austria-Hungary, on Oct. 9, 1918, the Countess attended the Potomac School in Washington, Miss Faunce's School in London and the Chateau Brilliantmont in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1949, she married Count Anthony Szapary, a founder of the Hungarian National Sports Federation. Earlier, during World War II, he had been sent to a concentration camp for activities with the Hungarian Red Cross and his relief work for Polish and Jewish refugees. He was released through the intervention of King Gustav V of Sweden and came to the United States in 1947, becoming an adviser to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. He died in 1972.         The Countess is survived by a son, Paul, and a daughter, Gladys Szapary, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Countess Ferdinandine Eltz of Salzburg, Austria.         Countess Szapary was a former president of the Rhode Island Arts Foundation at Newport and was actively involved in the Newport Preservation Society. She was an organizer of the Newport Coaching weekends and aided several charities. She enjoyed both giving and going to parties and, as an avid amateur photographer, almost always had a small camera slung around her neck at the many social occasions in which she took part. She was known among her friends for the small albums of photographs that she often sent to other celebrators.         Countess Szapary was chairwoman of the 1995 centennial celebration of the Breakers, for which she created, in the stables of the estate, ''New York Central With the Vanderbilts,'' a small-scale version of the New York Central Lines, founded by Cornelius Vanderbilt. The model was created using her own trains and has become a favorite display for the younger guests of the house.         Creating an image that has endured among preservationists as well as family members, the Countess appeared at the opening, immediately before the family ball was to begin, clad in a T-shirt with a New York Central logo, an engineer's cap and a bandaged foot.         ''She told me she had hurt it bungee jumping,'' said Alfred Vanderbilt Jr., a cousin.       
         Elizabeth Barnes, a volunteer for national organizations including the Y.W.C.A. and National Council of Negro Women, died on Thursday at the Health Clinic of Westminster Shores in St. Petersburg, Fla. She was 90 and a resident of St. Petersburg.         Mrs. Barnes, who had been a resident of New York City for many years, moved to Florida in 1996. Her son, Andrew Barnes, is the editor and chief executive of The St. Petersburg Times.         She worked for the council in the 1970's, writing biographies of successful black women. In the 1940's, she was on the Y.W.C.A.'s national board.         She also taught psychology at Sarah Lawrence College.         Her husband, Joe Barnes, a New York Herald Tribune correspondent in the 1930's and editor of The New York Star in the 1940's, died in 1970.         In addition to her son, she is survived by two daughters, Lila Jacobs of Minneapolis and Nancy Barnes of New York City, and three grandchildren.       
         Marianne Burge, the first woman to become a partner in the accounting firm of Price Waterhouse, died Feb. 25 at Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 64.         The cause of death was cancer, Price Waterhouse said.         Mrs. Burge joined the firm as a tax consultant in 1966 and became a partner in 1973.         An international tax specialist, she served for 13 years as the managing partner of the firm's international tax services practice in New York before her retirement in 1993. She was also a member of Price Waterhouse's worldwide tax services panel and was the first woman to lead a national practice area for the firm.         An authority on income tax treaties, Mrs. Burge advised Price Waterhouse clients on all aspects of multinational taxation, including joint ventures and acquisitions. She was also a specialist in international tax issues for the insurance industry, and worked extensively with insurance companies for the firm.         She lived in Manhattan and was a member of numerous professional organizations. They included the United States Council of International Business, the Financial Women's Association of New York and the International Fiscal Association. She was a former president of the International Tax Association.         Mrs. Burge was born on June 18, 1933 in Vienna. She received a bachelor's degree and master's degree, both in modern languages, from Cambridge University in England.         She is survived by her husband, William Burge of New York, to whom she had been married for 40 years.       
         Esther Bubley, a documentary photographer who was noted for her sober, no-frills portrayal of post-World War II middle America, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her niece, Jean Bubley.         In the late 1930's, Ms. Bubley was  drawn to the picture essays in Life magazine and to the photography project of the Farm Security Administration. She studied painting and photography at the Minneapolis School of Art, and in 1942 became a microfilmer of rare books at the National Archives in Washington. The next year she was transferred to the darkrooms of the Office of War Information, which was headed by Roy Stryker, former director of the farm photography project.         She photographed Washington during her spare time, producing images that, in their loneliness, mystery and sadness, predated Robert Frank's book, ''The Americans,'' by more than a decade. In a Hopperesque image from 1943, one of the many young women who had flocked to the nation's capital to work for the war effort is shown sitting by herself at the end of a long, polished table, her arms folded, a cigarette in one hand. Her face is spotlighted, a look of almost painful solitude etched on it. In a kind of companion image,  taken the same year, a soldier in a photography booth looks lost in gloomy thoughts.         That year, Stryker assigned Ms. Bubley to photograph the transportation services available to soldiers and their families. It was the beginning of a long association that she regarded as the most important in her career. Also through Stryker, she was assigned to documentary projects by various companies and  magazine editors.         Ms. Bubley moved to New York in the mid-1940's. In 1952, her work was included in a group show at the Museum of Modern Art in New York that was part of a series titled ''Diogenes With a Camera'' (the other photographers in the exhibition were Edward Weston, Frederick Sommer, Harry Callahan, Eliot Porter and W. Eugene Smith). In 1955, three of Ms. Bubley's images of schoolgirls and young women appeared in the ''Family of Man'' exhibition at the Modern.         In the 1970's, Ms. Bubley embarked on a very different photographic project: macrophotography of plants. These images were compiled in a 1979 book, ''A Mysterious Presence: Macrophotography of Plants.'' In her luminous, extreme close-ups, the plants are sinuous abstractions or have the fantastical tactility of insects under a powerful magnifier. One image of air bubbles caught in a starburst of cornflower seed hairs is magically jewel-like.         Ms. Bubley's work appeared in  publications including Life, Look, Sports Illustrated, Ladies Home Journal, Harper's Bazaar, Time, Fortune and The New York Times Magazine. Before her death, she was preparing a book of her work, to be published next year by the Smithsonian Institution Press.         Her 1947 marriage to Edwin Locke, a writer, ended in divorce. She is survived by two sisters, Anita Greenspan of Bethesda, Md., and Claire Tepper of Falls Church, Va.       
         Betty L. Santangelo, a retired teacher and school administrator who was long active in Italian-American and other civic affairs, died on March 15 at the home of a daughter in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 80 and formerly lived in the Bronx.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Santangelo was the widow of the former United States Representative, Alfred E. Santangelo, a Democrat of the Bronx and a strong voice for the Italian-American community. She shared his work in that area, and at her death she was the vice president and treasurer of the Italian Heritage and Culture Committee of the Bronx and Westchester.         Over the years she was active in Siamo (We Are), the Federation of Italian-American Educators and the National Italian American Foundation, of which her husband was a founder. She was an officer or board member of many charities, including the Italian Big Sisters, the Providence Rest Nursing Home and the Enrico Fermi Library and Culture Center branch of the New York Public Library in the Bronx.         She recently finished a 10-year labor of love: writing and assembling a book, ''Lucky Corner, the Biography of Congressman Alfred E. Santangelo and the Rise of Italian-Americans in Politics.'' Heavily illustrated, it is scheduled for publication later this year by the Center for Migration Studies.         A native of Manhattan, she graduated from Teachers College, Columbia University, in 1943. She taught at Benjamin Franklin High School in Manhattan, and she retired as an administrator at the College of New Rochelle in 1985.         She is survived by four daughters, Mary Jo Nocero of Orlando, Fla., Eileen Hult of Milwaukee, Betty J. Santangelo of Manhasset and Patricia A. Santangelo of Manhattan; a son, Charles A. Santangelo, of Washington; a sister, Rose Santangelo of Harrison, N.Y., and seven grandchildren. Her husband died in 1978.       
         Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the widow of John Hay (Jock) Whitney, the first wife of James Roosevelt and the last of the three glamorous Cushing sisters of Boston, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 89.         Mrs. Whitney was one of the most prestigious figures in New York society, although she disliked publicity and rarely attended large social gatherings. When she did appear at an event, it was considered a coup.         In recent years, in failing health, Mrs. Whitney, a prominent philanthropist in medicine and art, spent most of her time at Greentree, one of the most magnificent private residences in the country, situated on 438 acres in Manhasset, on Long Island's Gold Coast. There, surrounded by an important Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art collection, gardens and greenhouses, Mrs. Whitney was looked after by 20 employees.         Mrs. Whitney was the second-born of the three Cushing sisters, who were renowned in the 1930's and 40's for their brilliant marriages into some of the most prominent families in the country. She inherited the bulk of one of the great American fortunes when Jock Whitney -- sportsman, financier, publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, philanthropist, political mover and shaker, and Ambassador to Britain -- died in 1982. In 1990, Forbes magazine estimated her wealth at $700 million.         Practicing the Art Of Marrying Well         From their debutante days, she and her sisters were celebrated by society chroniclers for their beauty and charm. Her older sister, Mary (Minnie) Cushing, was married to Vincent Astor, the wealthy real estate owner, and after a divorce, to James Whitney Fosburgh, an artist. She died in 1978 at 72. Barbara (Babe) Cushing, the youngest, was married to Stanley Mortimer Jr., a grandson of one of the founders of Standard Oil, and after a divorce, to William S. Paley, the legendary founder and chairman of the Columbia Broadcasting System.         Babe Paley, a perennial name on the world's best-dressed list and a glittering figure in society, also died in 1978, at 62, four months before her older sister.         Betsey Maria Cushing was born in Baltimore on May 18, 1908. Her father was Dr. Harvey Cushing, a neurosurgeon who was a professor of surgery at various times at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities. Her mother was Katherine Crowell Cushing, of a socially prominent family in Cleveland.         Dr. Cushing was a stern father, and Mrs. Whitney later recalled that ''perfectionism was drummed into us.'' The social skills that she learned at Miss May's, a private day school in Boston, and at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn., were burnished by her mother, who made certain that her daughters excelled in the arts of entertaining and running a household as prerequisites for the advantageous marriages she was determined they would have.         David Grafton, the author of the 1992 book ''The Sisters: The Lives and Times of the Fabulous Cushing Sisters'' (Villard Books), wrote that Katherine Cushing once told a gossip columnist that she expected her girls ''to marry into the highest level of European nobility or into America's moneyed aristocracy.''         There were also two brothers, William and Henry, neither of whom survives.         Although marriage into the Roosevelt family did not apparently meet her highest expectations, it merited no objections. Betsey Cushing met James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, when she was 22.         They married at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Brookline, Mass., on June 5, 1930, two days before the bridegroom's graduation from Harvard. Five hundred leaders of the social and political worlds of Boston and New York watched the bride, in a floor-length gown of silver lame, exchange vows with the son of the Governor of New York and his wife. Elliott Roosevelt was his brother's best man, and two other brothers, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. and John A. Roosevelt, were among the ushers. Minnie Cushing was the maid of honor, and Babe Cushing was a bridesmaid.         As a young married woman, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt ''could be imperious,'' the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst later told Mr. Paley's biographer, Sally Bedell Smith. But,  Ms. Smith wrote, ''Fortunately, Betsey redeemed herself with a rollicking sense of humor and an ability to kick up her heels.''         Not Exactly a Favorite Of Eleanor Roosevelt         The young Roosevelts spent their early married life living with the Cushings, while the bridegroom studied law at the Boston University Law School. When Mr. Roosevelt went into the insurance business, the couple bought a house and property in Framingham, Mass. After his father became President of the United States and chose him as an aide, the couple lived in Georgetown.         The young Mrs. Roosevelt was said to be the President's favorite daughter-in-law, but she enjoyed no such preference from Eleanor Roosevelt and was, in turn, not fond of her mother-in-law. ''The two women were simply too strong and too different in personal style and social preferences,'' Mr. Grafton wrote.         Betsey Roosevelt was often the hostess at the White House when Eleanor Roosevelt was absent. She was in the forefront on a summer day in 1939 when the President entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic in Hyde Park, N.Y., at which the King ate his first hot dog. Later that day, when the President took the King and Queen for a drive along the Hudson River, the President asked Betsey Roosevelt to go along for company in the car.         Always family-conscious, she enhanced Babe Cushing's debutante season by giving a tea dance at the White House as a second coming-out party. She also introduced Minnie Cushing to Vincent Astor, and the two were married in 1940 after Mr. Astor divorced his first wife.         Even as a member of the President's circle, Betsey Roosevelt preferred a private life, and she did her best to shield her two daughters, Sara and Kate, from the public eye.         In November 1938, James Roosevelt left the Government and went to Hollywood to work in the movie business as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. His wife followed him, but they separated, and early in 1940 it was disclosed that they were to be divorced. Mr. Roosevelt filed for divorce on grounds of desertion, and his wife filed a cross-complaint on grounds of desertion and cruelty.         In March 1940, Mrs. Roosevelt obtained a divorce decree. She was given custody of the children, child support, a settlement and further payments until she remarried.         Mr. Roosevelt went on to become a decorated Marine officer in World War II, a six-term Congressman from California and a delegate to the United Nations during the Johnson Administration. He died in 1991.         Early in 1942, rumors of a romance between Betsey Cushing Roosevelt and Jock Whitney began circulating in New York, Boston and Washington. He had been divorced in 1940 after 10 years of marriage to the former Mary Elizabeth Altemus.         The couple were married in a small, informal ceremony on March 1, 1942, in her widowed mother's East 86th Street apartment. The bride was 33 and the bridegroom 37.         After a honeymoon at Greenwood Plantation in Thomasville, Ga., one of Mr. Whitney's many residences, the newlyweds moved to Washington, where he ran the motion picture division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, headed by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Whitney later joined the Air Force, rose to colonel, was a German prisoner for 18 days in 1944 before escaping and got several decorations.         In 1949, Mr. Whitney adopted his wife's two daughters. The Whitneys moved to London in 1957, when President Eisenhower named Mr. Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Mrs. Whitney renewed her friendship with the Queen Mother, whom she had met on the 1939 visit to America. Both Ambassador and Mrs. Whitney became close to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.         Mrs. Whitney spent a good deal of her time making the Whitney residences comfortable and welcoming. In his book, Mr. Grafton quoted a friend of hers as saying, ''The Jock Whitneys are just about as 'down-to-earth' as any people can be with a quarter of a billion dollars.''         White House Is Nice, But It's No Greentree         The residences that Mrs. Whitney had at her disposal over the years included, in addition to Greentree on Long Island and the plantation in Georgia, a town house and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island near New London, Conn.; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races there; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Ga., and a spacious house in Surrey, England, not far from the Ascot racecourse.         E. J. Kahn, Mr. Whitney's biographer, reported that years later one of the daughters, Kate, once took her own children on a tour of the White House. Mr. Kahn wrote, ''After inspecting it, they pronounced it nice enough but hardly on a par with Greentree.''         In addition, the Whitneys shared a renowned Kentucky horse farm, which also bore the name Greentree, with Mr. Whitney's sister, Joan Whitney Payson. It was later sold.         Mrs. Whitney established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups, and she was its president. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950's on 15 acres donated by Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Payson.         Mrs. Whitney was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art, Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. The Modern received eight major paintings, by artists like Utrillo, Picasso and Seurat, from Mr. Whitney's estate, and Yale received six paintings, valued at $5 million at that time. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center received a $15 million gift.         After her husband's death in 1982, Mrs. Whitney gave $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art got nine American and French paintings, which had been placed in a charitable trust during Mr. Whitney's lifetime. The trust also gave $2 million for acquisitions, and Mrs. Whitney chose a Toulouse-Lautrec painting from her husband's collection, ''Marcelle Lender Dancing the Bolero in 'Chilperic,' '' to give the gallery in his memory.         Mrs. Whitney made art history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene ''At the Moulin de la Galette.'' It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction.         Among Mrs. Whitney's many public activities were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service.         She is survived by her daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, both of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Celestine Tate Harrington, a quadriplegic street musician whose buoyant personality and unremitting chutzpah brought astounded smiles to everyone who watched her play the keyboard with her lips and tongue on Atlantic City's Boardwalk, died on Feb. 25 at the Atlantic City Medical Center. She was 42.         She died of complications resulting from critical injuries she suffered in a traffic accident on Feb. 19.         Mrs. Harrington was born with a congenital joint condition that eroded the connective tissue in her arms and legs, leaving them immobile stubs, but she never seemed to consider herself disabled. Her daily street performances in front of Bally's Park Place Casino and Caesar's Palace, where she performed ''Amazing Grace'' and ''Stormy Weather'' on an electric synthesizer, were studies not only in the art of music, but also in the art human self-salvation.         Mrs. Harrington was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, and her father abandoned her when she was 6 years old, family members and a friend said.         Raised by her maternal grandparents, a construction worker and a registered nurse, she eventually became a parent herself. In 1974, in downtown Philadelphia, she met John Smith, a nursing home aide who courted her while she lived at the Moss Rehabilitation Clinic in Philadelphia. She bore him a daughter, Nia, in 1975, but before the couple could marry, Mr. Smith died.         The death led the courts to seek custody of Nia. Mrs. Harrington won the right to raise her child in 1976 by demonstrating to a dumbstruck judge what she could manage: she changed the baby's diaper with her teeth.         Three years later, she met a construction worker, Stanford Williams. In 1979, they, too, had a daughter, Coronda, but never married.         Mrs. Harrington learned to play the keyboard at Philadelphia's Settlement Music School. Soon afterward, she decided to take her newfound skill downtown, where she played for change on the sidewalk in front of Wanamaker's department store. But Atlantic City -- bustling with tourists and extra change -- beckoned. She arrived on the Boardwalk in 1984, and she eventually moved into a condominium in Atlantic City purchased with the proceeds from her busking.         She often boasted that as much as $100,000 a year was dropped into her plastic bucket, though friends and relatives gently dispute that claim.         Though Mrs. Harrington eventually started a tiny enterprise designing business cards, her main interest was her music, and her repertoire of solemn ballads like ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow,'' and patriotic hymns like ''America the Beautiful,'' quickly made her a redemptive presence in a gambling town. They also won her a following among the Boardwalk's casual strollers.         By 1989, Mrs. Harrington was a beloved presence, partly because of the remarkable figure she cut: a 4-foot, 10-inch tall, 190-pound woman moving swiftly, lying on her stomach, head up, , through the city streets on a motorized gurney that she guided with a steering device worked by her chin. But she was also known for the inspirational message she spread as a guest on national talk shows or to people she met on the Boardwalk with whom she formed close relationships.         Among them was her husband, Roy Harrington, a casino maintenance man who came along in 1990. In the next year, the couple married and adopted Charles Graves, the son of a former boyfriend.         In addition to her husband and three children, Mrs. Harrington is survived by two sisters, Agnes Tate-Sanders and Tamogene Tate, both of Philadelphia, and a brother, Jay-Cee Tate of North Carolina.         Another person that Mrs. Harrington befriended was Camille LeClair, co-owner of a McDonald's restaurant in Atlantic City who hired her last year to take phone deliveries.         A poignant memory of Mrs. Harrington was on her mind last week when word came that she had died. On one occasion when Mrs. Harrington was in her house, Mrs. LeClair said: ''I hopped in the shower and when I came back I said to Celestine, 'Why does God allow me to jump in and out of the shower in 10 minutes, but you have to struggle so much?'  Well, Celestine just looked at me and said, 'That's why I'm here. To keep reminding you to count your blessings every day.' ''       
         Laurie Beechman, the throbbing-voiced singer and actress who played Grizabella in the Broadway musical ''Cats'' for more than five years, died on Sunday at her home in White Plains, N.Y. She was 44.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, said her agent and friend, Jim Wilhelm.         An emotive belter in the tradition of Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand, both of whom were her girlhood idols, Ms. Beechman brought a waifish pathos and a piercing vocal power to her character's signature song, ''Memory.''         Whether on Broadway, on a concert stage or in a cabaret, Ms. Beechman conveyed a strong involvement with her material, delivering the climaxes of big ballads with a full-throated, sobbing intensity.         Ms. Beechman was born in Philadelphia, attended New York University and made her Broadway debut in 1977 in the ensemble of ''Annie.''         Venturing into the pop arena, she  made an album, ''Laurie and the Sighs'' (Atlantic), that presented her as a rock belter in the mode of Pat Benatar. When the album sold poorly, she decided to stick to the worlds of theater and cabaret and returned to Broadway as the narrator in ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'' Her performance in that show won her Tony and Drama Desk nominations for best featured actress in a musical.         In 1983 she took the role of Grizabella in the national touring company of ''Cats'' with the proviso that she step into the part on Broadway when Betty Buckley departed. The chance came four months later.         In the late 1980's and 90's, Ms. Beechman became a cabaret and concert performer who often blended popular standards and theater songs with light rock-and-roll. She also recorded four more albums.         Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 1989. Despite her illness, she joined the national touring company of ''Les Miserables'' in the role of Fantine, performing in the touring production of ''The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Sunset Edition,'' and singing ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' at President Clinton's 1997 inaugural gala. Last spring she rejoined ''Cats'' in time to be playing Grizabella when the show surpassed ''A Chorus Line'' as Broadway's longest-running hit.         She is survived by her husband, Neil Mazzella; her parents, Dr. Nathan and Dolly Beechman Schnall of Philadelphia, and two sisters, Jane Segal and Claudia Cohen, both of Philadelphia. A funeral will be held tomorrow at 11 A.M. at J.  Levine and Sons Memorial Chapel, 7112 North Broad Street, Philadelphia.         Ms. Beechman became an advocate and role model for people with cancer. ''The perception people have of cancer,'' she told The New York Times, ''is that you're cured or you die, and that's not necessarily how it works. It can be more like diabetes, a part of life.''       
         Ilse Bing, one of the few surviving members of the fabled group of avant-garde artists who gathered in Paris in the early 1930's and produced brilliantly unorthodox and inventive photography, died Tuesday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. She was 98 and lived on the Upper West Side.         Susan Arthur Whitson, director of the Edwynn Houk Gallery, which represents her work, said that the gallery had hoped that Ms. Bing would attend the March 26 opening of a retrospective of her work titled ''Ilse Bing: Vision of a Century.'' She would have been 99 on March 23.         Born into an affluent bourgeois family in Frankfurt, Ms. Bing was trained in music and art. It was while she was pursuing a doctorate in art history and photographing buildings for her dissertation that she developed a passion for photography. In early 1929 she began to do picture essays for the weekly supplement of a Frankfurt newspaper, becoming one of the few women to work in photojournalism at the time.         She soon abandoned her studies to become an artist and decided to leave for Paris in the summer of 1929 after seeing an exhibition of photographs by the Paris-based Florence Henri, who had embraced New Photography, which was characterized by extreme close-ups, unusual angles, high and low vantage points, and the rendering of everyday objects and reflected surfaces as abstract geometric forms.         Paris in the 1920's and 30's was home to modernists like Henri, who saw photography as the medium to revolutionize visual language in everything from photojournalism and commercial advertising to fashion and book illustration. Working intuitively and with no regard for conventional composition or subject matter, these modern photographers were above all entranced by the new sensations of urban living.         The only professional photographer in Paris in the 30's to work exclusively with the Leica, Ms. Bing mastered the use of this small camera as well as darkroom techniques to show the subtleties of light and movement against the inky blacks of Paris at night. She favored the overhead shots and tilted angles of German Constructivists, but her photographs are often infused with the softer, more lyrical and humanistic qualities found in the work of many French photographers.         Like Andre Kertesz and Henri Cartier-Bresson, she caught the spare, lovely geometries in ordinary Parisian life. She photographed nighttime Paris, using available light and producing images that were studies of light and deep shadow. Accidentally in the darkroom, and independently of Man Ray, she discovered a way to solarize the negative instead of the print, giving the image black outlines created from the controlled use of light during printing. Her solarized images of street scenes, especially at night, are magical coaxings of many shades of gray out of darkness.         Ms. Bing worked for magazines like Vu, Arts et Metiers Graphiques and Le Monde Illustre. She did fashion assignments for Harper's Bazaar and Schiaparelli. Her photographs were regularly shown during the 30's at La Pleiade gallery in Paris, alongside the work of other members of the photographic avant-garde.         In 1936, she was included in the first modern photography exhibition held at the Louvre. The next year she was part of the landmark photography exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in New York.         Ms. Bing's best-known photograph from this period is a strikingly original self-portrait. To create this fractured image, she photographed a mirrored image of herself -- one bent arm leaning against a table, a Leica on a tripod positioned in front of one eye -- with a side view of herself reflected in another mirror.         When Ms. Bing visited New York in 1936, she was offered a position on the fledgling photo magazine Life. But she turned down the offer because her future husband, Konrad Wolff, a pianist and musicologist, lived in Paris. They married in 1937. Both were German Jews and were interned briefly as enemy aliens by the Vichy Government in 1940, but both managed to get themselves freed. Later that year, they sailed for New York, where they remained for the rest of their lives. Mr. Wolff died in 1989. No immediate family members survive. A memorial service will be held at the National Arts Club at 15 Gramercy Park South on April 2 at 3 P.M.         In March 1993, Ms. Bing was awarded the first Gold Medal for photography by the National Arts Club in Manhattan. She told an interviewer from The New York Times that she had given up photography in 1959 because ''everything moves, nothing stays and I should not hold on.'' Ms. Bing next turned to poetry, creating what she called ''snapshots without a camera.'' She also made collages with old photographs and objects, and illustrated whimsical books on etymology and on numbers. And she groomed dogs for a living.         Ms. Bing was, Ms. Whitson said, ''very sharp, very funny and very active -- she took up the motorcycle when she was in her 70's.''       
         Bella S. Abzug, New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist, politician and lawyer, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77.         She died of complications following heart surgery, said Harold Holzer, who was her spokesman when she served in Congress. She had been hospitalized for weeks, and had been in poor health for several years, he said.         Ms. Abzug represented the West Side of Manhattan for three Congressional terms in the 1970's. She  brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character. Often called just Bella, she was recognizable everywhere by her big hats and a voice that Norman Mailer said ''could boil the fat off a taxicab driver's neck.''         She opposed the Vietnam War, championed what was then called women's liberation and was one of the first to call for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. Long after it ceased to be fashionable, she called her politics radical. During her last campaign, for Congress in 1986, she told The New York Times, ''I am not a centrist.''         Bella Abzug was a founding feminist, and an enduring one. In the movement's giddy, sloganeering early days, Ms. Abzug was, like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, an icon, the hat bobbing before the cameras at marches and rallies.         After leaving the House in January 1977, she worked for women's rights for two more decades. She founded an international women's group that worked on environmental issues. And she was a leader of a conference of nongovernmental organizations that paralleled the United Nations' fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.         Even then, she continued to rankle.  Former President George Bush, on a private visit to China that coincided with the Beijing conference, said to a meeting of food production executives: ''I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around. Bella Abzug is one who has always represented the extremes of the women's movement.''         When told of Mr. Bush's remark, Ms. Abzug, 75 and in a wheelchair, retorted: ''He was addressing a fertilizer group? That's appropriate.''         Her forceful personality and direct manner made her a lightning rod for criticism from those who opposed the idea of holding a women's conference. After Bob Dole, then the Senate majority leader, said he could not imagine why anyone ''would want to attend a conference co-chaired by Bella Abzug,'' she responded that she was not running the meeting but simply participating with more than 30,000 other women over how best to achieve equal rights.         But much of what Ms. Abzug agitated for -- abortion rights, day care, laws against employment discrimination -- was by that time mainstream political fare.         In Congress, ''she was first on almost everything, on everything that ever mattered,'' said Esther Newberg, Ms. Abzug's first administrative assistant and one of many staff members who quit but remained devoted. ''She was first to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, first to call for an end to the war.''         Ms. Abzug made enemies easily -- ''Sometimes the hat and the mouth took over,'' Ms. Newberg said -- but Ms. Abzug saw that as a consequence of a refusal to compromise, as well as a matter of sport. Of her time in the House, Ms. Abzug wrote in a journal that was published in 1972 as ''Bella,'' ''I spend all day figuring out how to beat the machine and knock the crap out of the political power structure.''         She worked relentlessly at organizing and coalition-building. A founder of Women Strike for Peace and the National Women's Political Caucus, she spent a lifetime prodding for change, with a lawyer's enthusiasm for political channels, through organizations from the P.T.A. to the United Nations.         She made friends easily, too. ''She's fierce and intense and funny,'' said her longtime friend Gloria Steinem. ''She takes everyone seriously. When she argues with you fiercely, it's because she takes you seriously. And she's willing to change her mind. That's so rare.''         Her First Speech, In a Subway Station         Bella Savitzky Abzug was born on July 24, 1920 in the Bronx, the second daughter of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father, Emanuel Savitzky, whom Ms. Abzug later described as ''this humanist butcher,'' ran (and named) the Live and Let Live Meat Market on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan.         She said she knew from the age of 11 that she wanted to be a lawyer, and not long afterward gave her first public speech, in a subway station, while collecting for a Zionist youth organization. She went from Hunter College, where she was student body president, to Columbia University Law School, where she was an editor of The Law Review, to a practice representing union workers.         Ms. Abzug traced the wearing of her trademark wide-brimmed hats to those days. She once recalled: ''When I was a young lawyer, I would go to people's offices and they would always say: 'Sit here. We'll wait for the lawyer.' Working women wore hats. It was the only way they would take you seriously.         ''After a while, I started liking them. When I got to Congress, they made a big thing of it. So I was watching. Did they want me to wear it or not? They didn't want me to wear it, so I did.''         All the while, she was a leftist and an agitator. Later, exasperated with her Congressional aides, she wrote: ''I just don't understand young people today, quite frankly. Our struggle was political, ideological and economic, and we felt we couldn't make something of ourselves unless we bettered society. We saw the two together.''         In the 1950's, Ms. Abzug's law practice turned to other cases identified with the left. One client was Willie McGee, a black Mississippian convicted of raping a white woman and sentenced to death. Ms. Abzug, who was pregnant at the time, argued the case in Mississippi while white supremacist groups threatened her. Though the Supreme Court stayed the execution twice, Mr. McGee was eventually executed.         She also represented people accused of Communist activities by Senator Joseph McCarthy's Congressional committee and its counterpart in Albany.         In the 1960's, Ms. Abzug became an antiwar activist. A founder of Women Strike for Peace, she became its chief lobbyist, protesting nuclear testing and, later, the Vietnam War. She organized insurgent Democrats into other groups, too, becoming a leader of the movement against President Lyndon B. Johnson and a prominent figure in the 1968 Presidential campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy.         During those years, Ms. Abzug started navigating New York City politics. She and her husband, Martin, moved from Mount Vernon, the Westchester suburb where they had raised their two daughters, to a town house at 37 Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In 1970, Ms. Abzug ran for Congress.         The 19th Congressional District, which snaked from lower Manhattan  to the West 80's, had four registered Democrats to every Republican and had been represented in Congress for seven terms by Leonard Farbstein, a  solid but rather somnolent liberal. Ms. Abzug won the Democratic primary with 54 percent of the vote.         Campaign Became A Women's Crusade         At this point, Bella Abzug became national news, a flash of local color in a political year. She seemed to be everywhere, clapping backs and jabbing biceps. Her campaign headquarters next to the Lion's Head, a writers' and journalists' bar in Greenwich Village, was also a day-care center for her legions of female volunteers. The women's crusade she led brought considerable, if sometimes derisive, attention.         Though she eventually took 55 percent of the vote, she had genuine Republican opposition, unusual in an era when New York's main political action consisted of various Democratic factions knifing one another. The Republican-Liberal candidate was Barry Farber, a well-known radio talk show host. Mr. Farber drew many Democrats who resented Mr. Farbstein's humiliation or were simply put off by Ms. Abzug's style.         To her chagrin, Mr. Farber accused Ms. Abzug, who advocated direct negotiations between Israelis and Arabs, of flagging in her support of Israel. For years after that, she made a point of stating her Jewish credentials, dating to childhood: her family was religious and she went regularly to synagogue (though she was bothered that women were relegated to the back rows of the balcony), studied Hebrew and was enrolled for a time at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         When Ms. Abzug went to Washington, she sought an appointment to the Armed Services Committee. She wanted a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam and she vowed to take on the military-industrial complex. She wanted to end the draft. She wanted national health insurance, money for  day-care centers and housing, and more money for New York City, all to be paid for with billions siphoned from the Pentagon's budget.         She got little of this, but during the next six years ''she was indefatigable,'' Ms. Newberg recalled. ''She yelled a lot,only because she couldn't get everything done.'' And if she couldn't, Ms. Newberg added, it was partly because ''her agenda was too pure for her moment in time.''         Ms. Abzug did become expert at parliamentary rules, worked them skillfully and was famously well prepared for every vote, hearing and committee spat. The ''sunshine law'' requiring governing bodies to meet publicly came out of a subcommittee she headed. She coaxed funds for New York from the Public Works Committee. She was a co-sponsor of  the women's equal rights amendment. ''She was one of the most exciting, enlightened legislators that ever served in the Congress,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, with whom Ms. Abzug sometimes collaborated and sometimes sparred.         From her first day on Capitol Hill -- the day she dismayed her colleagues by introducing her Vietnam resolution -- Ms. Abzug derided the Congressional club, the seniority system, the log-rolling and back-scratching. She did not spare fellow Democrats; when she spoke of liberals, it was usually dismissively. She badgered the House leadership over committee appointments and votes.         She badgered the President, too. Invited to a reception at Richard Nixon's White House, she accepted (while writing in her journal, ''Who wants to listen to his pious idiocies?''), then announced to Nixon in the receiving line that her constituents demanded a withdrawal from Vietnam.         For all of her railing against Democrats who went along to get along,  Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill named her one of his dozen assistant whips, and by most accounts she worked well with some of the crustiest fixtures in the House.         Still, a 1972 report by Ralph Nader  estimated that Ms. Abzug's sponsorship of a measure often cost it 20 to 30 votes. Her reputation as an irritant came from all quarters. Jimmy Breslin wrote of a campaign worker who repaired to the Lion's Head one night, holding his side and swearing never to work for Ms. Abzug again. ''She punched me,'' he explained, in a quarrel over scheduling. The next day, Mr. Breslin reported, Ms. Abzug called the aide. ''Michael, I called to apologize,'' she said. ''How's your kidney?''         Mr. Breslin also recounted the Congresswoman's introduction to Sol Linowitz, the former chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a Democratic Party luminary: ''Are you the man that used to be head of the Xerox?'' Ms. Abzug asked. ''That's right,'' Mr. Linowitz replied. ''I'm glad to meet a big shot,'' Ms. Abzug said. ''I'm in hock $35,000 on my campaign.''         Ms. Abzug acknowledged loneliness in her years in Congress. ''Outside of Martin and the kids, I don't feel very related to most people at this point,'' she wrote in 1971. ''I feel detached in social situations. I'm always thinking about other things, about Congress, about the issues, about the political coalition I'm trying to organize. It never leaves me. I even have trouble relating to some of my closest friends, though God knows I still love them, even if they don't know it.''         Always, she returned to Manhattan to spend weekends with her husband.         She had married Martin Abzug in 1944. The two New Yorkers met on a bus in Miami, when both were on the way to a Yehudi Menuhin concert. Mr. Abzug, a stockbroker and an author of two published novels, had next to no interest in politics. In an interview in 1970, he murmured, while his wife was out of the room, ''The political bug is a curious bug.'' But he was, she said, her best friend and supporter, and ''one of the few unneurotic people left in society.''         Corrosive Ambition Hampers a Career         Ms. Abzug's own ambition was too corrosive for many people, even -- or, perhaps, especially -- for her fellow New York Democrats. When the State Legislature sliced up her district in 1972, they urged her to challenge one of the two conservative incumbent Democrats in adjoining districts, Representative John J. Rooney or Representative John M. Murphy. Instead, she opposed a liberal Democrat, William Fitts Ryan, in the 20th District, encompassing the Upper West Side and the Riverdale section of the Bronx.         The primary was bitter and, eventually, politically expensive to Ms. Abzug. Bill Ryan was one of the earliest heroes of the city's insurgent Democrats, an early opponent of the  Vietnam War and a genuinely well-liked man who, as many of his constituents knew, was waging a gallant fight against cancer.         Mr. Ryan defeated Ms. Abzug in the Democratic primary but died before the general election. The Democratic County Committee appointed Ms. Abzug as the candidate to replace him, but she was challenged by Mr. Ryan's widow, Priscilla, who ran on the Liberal line. Ms. Abzug won in November, but she had made dedicated enemies who believed she was an overly aggressive politician who would not hesitate to attack anyone who got in her way. Ten years later, she was denied a seat in the state's delegation to the national party's biannual conference because New York leaders considered her disruptive.         In 1976, she gave up her House seat to run for the Senate. She lost in the primary, to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, by a margin of only 1 percent. Two more campaigns quickly followed. (In a 1978 interview, she said: ''I'm a politician. I run for office. That's my profession.'') She lost to Edward I. Koch in a crowded mayoral primary in 1977. The next year, running for the House again, she lost, again by just 1 percent, to a little-known Republican, S. William Green.         She was appointed co-chairwoman  of President Jimmy Carter's National Advisory Committee on Women, and then, after disagreeing with him over economic policy, was dismissed. The majority of the committee members resigned in protest. Ms. Abzug, unapologetic, said with a shrug, ''I've got to find myself another big, nonpaying job.''         Her next and last campaign was in 1986, this time for a House seat in Westchester County. She won the primary in a burst of the old, ebullient campaigning style, but lost in November to Joseph J. DioGuardi, the Republican incumbent.         It was during that campaign that Martin Abzug died. Her friends said Ms. Abzug never recovered. Nine years later, she said, , ''I haven't been entirely the same since.''         There was one more bid for office, for her old House seat on the Upper West Side, when she announced her candidacy to replace Representative Ted Weiss on his death just before the 1992 election. But she was quickly eliminated from the field at the party convention.         During the next decade, Ms. Abzug suffered from ill health, including breast cancer, but continued to practice law and work for women's groups. She wrote a book, ''Gender Gap,'' with her old friend Mim Kelber. She started a lobbying group called Women U.S.A. and founded the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a group that works with international agencies.         In addition to her daughters, Eve and Liz, Ms. Abzug is survived by her sister, Helene Alexander of Great Neck, N.Y.         ''I've been described as a tough and noisy woman, a prizefighter, a man hater, you name it,'' Ms. Abzug said of herself in ''Bella.'' ''They call me Battling Bella, Mother Courage and a Jewish mother with more complaints than Portnoy.''         ''There are those who say I'm impatient, impetuous, uppity, rude, profane, brash and overbearing. Whether I'm any of these things or all of them, you can decide for yourself. But whatever I am -- and this ought to be made very clear at the outset -- I am a very serious woman.''       
         Sister Jogues Egan, a former provincial superior and college administrator in the Order of the Sacred Heart of Mary and an associate dean at Empire State College who briefly went to jail for her antiwar convictions in 1971, died on Monday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y. She was 79 and had lived at Marymount Convent in Tarrytown, N.Y., since her retirement in 1992.         She suffered a brief illness, according to the order's Provincial Center in Tarrytown, which serves the Northeastern United States.         The Irish-born Sister Jogues (pronounced zhogs) was the Superior of Eastern American Province when the Government sought to link her to the so-called Kissinger plot involving the Rev. Philip F. Berrigan and other Roman Catholic peace protesters. The Government charged that the group, called the Harrisburg Six, had conspired to blow up Federal property in Washington and to kidnap Henry A. Kissinger, then the national security adviser in the Nixon Administration.         Sister Jogues was ordered to testify before a Federal grand jury about any knowledge she might have had of the matter, but she refused. Termed an unindicted co-conspirator, she was sent to prison by a Federal judge in Harrisburg, Pa., who found her guilty of contempt of court.         Sister Jogues asserted in court that the questions put to her stemmed from illegal wiretaps placed by Federal agents on the religious order's telephones as far away as its headquarters in Rome. An appeals court ordered her released after three days, finding that her argument merited consideration; she was spared further prosecution.         She was born Johanna Egan in County Leitrim and studied at the Convent of the Sacred Heart of Mary in County Antrim before coming to the United States. She graduated with a degree in French from Marymount College, earned an M.A. in French from McGill University in Montreal and a Ph.D. in French from Laval University in Quebec.         She entered the order at Marymount in 1936 and made her final vows there in 1943, taking the name  of St. Isaac Jogues, a French Jesuit martyr. By then, she had begun her teaching career in New York and California, with an emphasis on French language and literature.         She was named an assistant professor at Marymount College in 1944. She subsequently worked as principal of Marymount Academy in Tarrytown, academic dean of Marymount College, president of Marymount College in Boca Raton, Fla., and, from 1964 to 1966, president of Marymount Manhattan College on East 71st Street.         She then served as provincial superior and, after her term expired, became Professor Egan at Empire State College-State University of New York in 1972. Over the next 20 years, she was an associate dean and professor of cultural studies and French literature.         Sister Jogues is survived by a sister, Kate Egan Neville of Wexford, Ireland.       
         Joanne Eve Lukomnik, a consultant and lifelong advocate of community health services who was also active in national professional and policy-making health groups, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 51.         The cause was complications from multiple myeloma, her family said.         Over the years, Dr. Lukomnik held teaching, medical and administrative positions at Columbia University's School of Public Health, the United States Public Health Service, Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Jersey City Family Health Center, among others.         She was on many committees and boards of the American Public Health Association and was elected chairwoman in 1995. Her other associations included the National Conference on Primary Care, sponsored jointly by the Federal Public Health Service and the Kellogg, Kaiser and Robert Wood Johnson Foundations. She was also a member of the editorial board of The Journal of the American Medical Women's Association.         She was raised in the Bronx, studied sociology and anthropology at Reed College, and graduated with a degree in fine arts from New York University in 1969. She took premedical studies at Columbia and received her M.D. in 1975 from the State University Health Science Center in Stony Brook, N.Y..         She held a master's degree in public health from Columbia, and she studied sociology at the University of Edinburgh and social medicine at the Hadassah Medical School in Jerusalem.         Dr. Lukomnik is survived by her husband, Len Rodberg; two children, Simon and Josie Rodberg of Manhattan; her mother, Mary Lukomnik of the Bronx, and her brothers, David and Jon Lukomnik, both of Manhattan.       
         Maria Grandy, a ballet teacher and coach long associated with the Joffrey Ballet and the chairwoman of the Dance Notation Bureau, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 61 and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Seymour Schorr.         In 1957 and 1958, Ms. Grandy was a dancer in the Robert Joffrey Theater Ballet, as the company was then called. After appearing on television, in summer stock and at Radio City Music Hall, she returned to the Joffrey Ballet in 1966 as a coach in its apprenticeship program.         Because of her teaching ability, she was asked in 1972 to help guide Joffrey II, the organization's second company. She worked with its artistic director, Sally Bliss, as an associate director and eventually served as full director for two years until the troupe was reorganized in 1985.         While with the Joffrey, Ms. Grandy studied Labanotation, a system of notation for preserving dance, at the Dance Notation Bureau. Over the years, she staged ballets by Joffrey, Leonide Massine and Antony Tudor for the Vienna State Opera Ballet, the Royal Ballet of Flanders and Ottawa Ballet Theater, among other companies. She became chairwoman of the notation bureau in 1994.         A native of Portland, Ore., Ms. Grandy began her dance training there, and in 1955 toured with the New York City Ballet on a special short-term contract. She came to New York with that company, and later danced with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet.         Ms. Grandy joined the dance faculty of the Juilliard School in 1989. She served on the board of the National Association for Regional Ballet, a group now known as Regional Dance America. She also was ballet mistress for the New York City Opera and a member of the dance panel of the New York State Council on the Arts.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Grandy is survived by her mother, Frances Grandy of Manhattan; two daughters, Allegra Fitch of Brooklyn and Lydia Silverman of Riverdale, the Bronx, and three grandchildren, Zachary Fitch and Julia and Evan Silverman.       
         Florence Skelly Altman, an innovator in opinion research, died on Tuesday at Scottsdale, Ariz., Memorial Hospital. She was 73 and lived in Scottsdale.         The cause of death was complications of heart disease, her daughter, Alexandra Altman, said.         Ms. Skelly, as she was known professionally, was instrumental in developing many techniques that are now standard in market research, including the use of simulated test markets to estimate the potential of new products. Today, variations of the method are used by major packaged goods marketing companies such as Procter & Gamble.         ''She had a great flair for the numbers side of the business, but saw the human implications of the numbers like no one I have ever known,'' said Daniel Yankelovich, a partner of Ms. Skelly at the opinion research firm that bore their names.         The social implications of Ms. Skelly's work were apparent in a study of younger Americans she and Mr. Yankelovich conducted in the late 1960's, among the first to call them baby boomers.         Arthur H. White, another partner and a professional colleague of Ms. Skelly for 50 years, said, ''The study revealed gender and race problems, that we had a society in which large segments of the population were not treated as well as other segments and that attitudes about institutions were changing.''         ''In those studies,'' he added, ''we saw that most people did not want to accept everything an employer or the Government said.''         Ms. Skelly had firsthand experience with sex discrimination early in her career. Mr. White recalled a meeting in the 1950's that he, Ms. Skelly and another male executive from Stewart Dougall, a New York research firm where she worked early on, were asked to attend with the board of the New York Stock Exchange. ''She had to sit outside in the hall while we, the two men, went in to talk,'' Mr. White said.         Suffering such indignities did little to dispel what her colleagues said was an admirable disposition.         ''She was a wonderful, witty person, very funny but serious at the same time, which is a great combination,'' Mr. Yankelovich said. ''Our clients loved her, and she loved the business.''         Ms. Skelly, a longtime resident of New York, moved to Scottsdale in the mid-1990's. She was a graduate of Hunter College, where her senior honors paper in social psychology, based on a public opinion survey of a Y.W.H.A. project in New York, exhibited her interest in market research.         She spent four years at Stewart Dougall, went to Washington for two years and worked on the 1950 Census, and then returned to the firm.         In 1961 she and Mr. White left to join Mr. Yankelovich. Later in the decade, the firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. was renamed Yankelovich, Skelly & White. In 1986, two years after the firm was bought by the  Saatchi & Saatchi Company, the advertising concern, Mr. Yankelovich, Ms. Skelly and Mr. White left to start another firm, citing policy disagreements.         Until her death Ms. Skelly served as vice chairwoman of the new firm, DYG Inc., based in Danbury, Conn. (Saatchi & Saatchi sold the former Yankelovich, Skelly & White, now Yankelovich Partners, in 1992.)         In recognition of her contributions to the field, in 1990 the Market Research Council inducted Ms. Skelly into its Market Research Hall of Fame.         Over the years Ms. Skelly served on numerous boards, including the National Council of Christians and Jews, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Business Advisory Board and the Warnaco Corporation.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, Ms. Skelly is survived by her husband, Eugene Altman of Scottsdale, and a son, Jonathan Altman of Los Angeles.       
         Laila Twigg-Smith, an art collector and philanthropist, died on March 24 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 53 and had recently moved to Manhattan from Honolulu.         The cause was liver failure, said Christopher English Walling, a friend.         A trustee of the New Museum of Contemporary Art in SoHo, she was also a member of its capital campaign steering and accessions committees, and was particularly involved in planning the new bookstore that opened as part of the museum's recent renovation. She was a member of the national committee of the Whitney Museum of American Art and of its painting and sculpture committee. In 1991 she won the Gertrude Vanderbilt Whitney Award from the Skowhegan School in Maine.         Ms. Twigg-Smith, who had been married to Thurston Twigg-Smith, former publisher of The Honolulu Advertiser, had lived since 1970 in Hawaii, where she and her husband had put together a substantial collection of contemporary art. They divorced two years ago.         She was instrumental in starting the Contemporary Arts Center in Honolulu and was active as an exhibition juror, lecturer, curator and teacher there. From 1980 to 1985 she was Commissioner of Visual Arts for the City and County of Honolulu. In the 1970's she wrote art reviews for The Honolulu Star-Bulletin.         She was also an artist with a particular interest in the print media and had studied art in college in California and later in Hawaii. She was known in the art world as a charismatic figure, with a sharp and enthusiastic eye for new art.         She is survived by a son, Cade Roster, of Honolulu.       
         Wendy O. Williams, the leader of the 1980's punk band the Plasmatics, a group more famous for their destructive onstage antics than for their music, died on Monday at her home in Storrs, Conn., in what officials called a suicide. She was 48.         The cause was a gunshot wound to the head, said a spokeswoman for the state's Chief Medical Examiner, who said that she had committed suicide.         Born in Rochester to an Eastman Kodak chemist and his wife, Ms. Williams got her first taste of fame tap-dancing on the ''Howdy Doody Show'' at age 6 and had her first but not last run-in with the law at age 15 when she was arrested for sunbathing nude. She left high school soon after and hitchhiked to Colorado and later Florida, making money selling crafts and working as a lifeguard. She drifted through Europe, bartending, dancing and getting arrested for shoplifting and passing counterfeit money. In 1976 she landed in Manhattan as a performer at Captain Kink's Sex Fantasy Theater, where she met Rod Swenson, a Yale graduate who ran the sex shows there.         Mr. Swenson became her manager in 1978 and helped her put together the Plasmatics, which made its debut at CBGB's, the punk and New Wave mecca of the time. The group's music was loud, heavy guitar-driven rock, which transformed from noise to heavy metal as the years wore on, all with Ms. Williams singing, rasping and ranting on top.         It was the band's performances, however, that brought it to national attention. Ms. Williams, with a striking blond mohawk and wearing a nurse's uniform, electrical tape or just shaving cream would attack guitars with chainsaws, fire shotguns at amplifiers and destroy television sets with sledgehammers. At one performance, she leapt out of a Cadillac moments before it exploded and plunged into the Hudson River. On Tom Snyder's ''Tomorrow,'' she blew up another automobile, and in videos she leapt from moving cars to airplanes and crashed a school bus into a wall of television sets.         After the release of the first of four Plasmatics albums, ''New Hope for the Wretched,'' on Stiff Records in 1981, Ms. Williams became a First Amendment cause celebre when she was arrested in Milwaukee and later in Cleveland on obscenity charges involving lewd gestures made with a sledgehammer and a microphone. (The charges didn't stick.) In 1985 she was nominated for a Grammy Award for best female rock vocal.         As Plasmatics members drifted into other bands, Ms. Williams recorded solo albums, put together various incarnations of the Plasmatics and starred in film comedies like ''Reform School Girls'' and ''Pucker Up and Bark Like a Dog.'' Despite her image, friends described Ms. Williams as a warm, ascetic and somewhat shy vegetarian who demanded sprouts and tofu backstage, spent 12 hours a week working out and contributed to animal rights causes. Ms. Williams moved with Mr. Swenson to Connecticut in 1991, where she worked with animals.         She is survived by her mother and two sisters.       
         Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the spirited writer and environmentalist who was known as the patron saint of the Florida Everglades for her ceaseless campaign to preserve the fragile wetlands, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 108.         Mrs. Douglas, who prevailed in recent years over blindness, hearing difficulties and other ailments, died in the English-style cottage she had built on a leafy street in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood in 1926.         ''The years caught up with her,'' William T. Muir, a lawyer and friend, told The Associated Press. He said that after cremation, her remains would be scattered over a portion of  Everglades National Park that bears her name.         The author of many short stories, novels and works of nonfiction, Mrs. Douglas was best known for her 1947 call to arms, ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' which was at once a natural and political history and a  warning of what was to come if developers and other commercial interests were permitted to have their way with the unique wetlands that cover much of southern Florida.         The book became a best-seller and transformed public perception of the wetlands, which were then considered by most people to be useless swamps that should be drained and developed for farming and housing.  The novelist John Hersey, reviewing the book for The New York Herald Tribune, called it ''a remarkable almost poem'' and said that in the years to come, it would remain ''unique in any company.''         Mrs. Douglas began her book simply: ''There are no other Everglades in the world.''         ''The simplicity, the diversity, the related harmony of the forms of life they enclose. . . . It is a river of grass,'' she wrote.         Her phrase ''river of grass'' caught the public imagination but it was also a reference to the fact that the Everglades is really a vast, slow-moving stream of shallow water and saw grass that covers much of the final 100 miles of South Florida.         Mrs. Douglas was considered an authority on the delicate ecosystem of the Everglades, which is home to ibises, roseate spoonbills, wood storks, manatees, the threatened Florida panther and saltwater crocodile, and hundreds of other animals, fish and plants. But in her book she made her case with a rare blend of science, local lore and history, and shimmering writing: ''The clear burning light of the sun pours daylong into the saw grass and is lost there, soaked up, never given back. Only the water flashes and glints. The grass yields nothing.''         In 1947, the year her book was published, she also helped lead the campaign to have the central core of the Everglades preserved as Everglades National Park.         Long before water problems began to plague South Florida, Mrs. Douglas cried out against poor land management and the ill-planned creation of canals that, in effect, decreased the amount of fresh water in the Everglades and increased the amount of salt water, imperiling the ecosystem.         She deplored state and local policies that encouraged overdevelopment of the Everglades and threatened the very source water on which South Florida depends. Of the people of South Florida, she said, ''They could not get it through their heads that they had produced some of the worst conditions themselves, by their lack of cooperation, their selfishness, their mutual distrust and their willful refusal to consider the truth of the whole situation.''         She added that unless people acted more responsibly, ''overdrainage will go on'' and ''the soil will shrink and burn and be wasted and destroyed, in a continuing ruin.''         But in ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' she expressed the hope that ''perhaps even in this last hour, in a new relation of usefulness and beauty, the vast, magnificent, subtle and unique region of the Everglades may not be utterly lost.''         In 1969, she helped found Friends of the Everglades, a conservation organization that now has 5,000 members. Joe Podgor, the former executive director, called her ''the giant on whose shoulders we all stand.''         In 1990, on her 100th birthday, when she was blind and frail, she continued to speak out against those who plundered the Everglades. And as damaged as the Everglades were, the fact that any of it remained was in large measure a tribute to her perseverance.         Roderick J. Jude, a longtime leader of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, said, ''The Everglades wouldn't be there for us to try to continue to save if not for her work through the years.''         Once an area of more than 4,000 square miles, the Everglades has shrunk to less than half its original size, the result of overdrainage, urban sprawl and pollution from government-supported sugar cane and dairy farming. Many think its long-range future is still tenuous.         In 1996, President Clinton endorsed a project to protect the Everglades by spending several hundred million dollars to buy farmland, take it out of production and try to restore the kind of natural water flow that Mrs. Douglas warned the state it was in danger of losing.         The proposal was strongly opposed by farmers, who saw it as an erosion of agribusiness. The sugar farmers asserted it was not their activities that damaged the Everglades as much as government drainage and flood control projects that turned wetlands into dry land so that it could be used for urban development.         In 1996, the voters of Florida approved a constitutional amendment for the cleanup of the Everglades,  but rejected a penny-a-pound tax on sugar to pay for it. The sugar growers convinced a majority of voters that the tax would have cost thousands of jobs.         The following year the Clinton Administration and the State of Florida agreed to buy more than 50,000 acres of sugar cane fields on the outskirts of Everglades National Park, a step toward rescuing the endangered ecosystem from polluted runoff.         A comprehensive restoration plan for the Everglades is expected later this year from the Army Corps of Engineers, which together with the South Florida Water Management District, a state agency, has been directed by Congress to oversee the huge replumbing project designed to restore the flow of fresh, clean water on which the Everglades depends.         Marjory Stoneman was born April 7, 1890, in Minneapolis, the daughter of Frank and Lillian Stoneman. Her father was a judge who became the first editor of the paper that eventually became The Miami Herald; her mother was a concert violinist.         Mrs. Douglas was raised in Taunton, Mass., and went to Wellesley College, where she majored in English, graduating in the class of 1912. Two years later she married a newspaperman named Kenneth Douglas, but realizing her marriage was a mistake she went to Miami, where she became a reporter at her father's newspaper. During World War I, she served with the American Red Cross in France, Belgium, Italy and in the Balkans.         Back in Miami after the war, she obtained a divorce and was reunited with her father at The Herald, becoming assistant editor, writing editorials and editing a literary column called ''The Galley.'' Her editorial writing presaged ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' in that she began to explore the problems associated with Florida's rapid commercial development.         In 1923 she left The Herald to try free-lancing and sold her first story to The Saturday Evening Post. In 1928 she won second place in the O. Henry Memorial Prize for short story writing. In 1937, another of her short stories, ''Story of a Homely Woman,'' was included in a selection of the best Post stories published that year. Her first novel, ''Road to the Sun,'' which she worked on for 10 years, was published in 1951. It was the first of several works she would create for young readers.         Among Mrs. Douglas's other works were ''The Key to Paris,'' a book for young readers published in 1961, and a play, ''The Gallows Gate,'' in 1928. With John Rothchild she wrote ''Voice of the River,'' in 1987, an autobiography that told of her fierce advocacy of conservation measures to save the natural environment of South Florida.         Her short stories appeared in many magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and Women's Home Companion.         In addition to her writing, Mrs. Douglas taught at the University of Miami from 1925 to 1929 and also lectured at Pennsylvania State University in the late 1920's. She served on the editorial board of the University of Miami Press and for a time wrote book reviews. Among her other interests was the Junior Museum of Miami and the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Association. She was also a member of the Society of Women Geographers.         Mrs. Douglas, who had no immediate survivors, was honored in many ways. Queen Elizabeth visited her in 1991. Two years later, President Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The building in Tallahassee that houses the state Department of Environmental Protection is named for her. Also named for her are a nature center in Key Biscayne and several schools and parks elsewhere in Florida.         President Clinton said of Mrs. Douglas in a statement from Germany, ''Long before there was an Earth Day, Mrs. Douglas was a passionate steward of our nation's natural resources, and particularly her Florida Everglades.''         On her 100th birthday, Marjory Stoneman Douglas was asked if she had hope for the Everglades' survival. She answered: ''I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I say it's got to be done.''       
         P. W. Manchester, a Britain-born critic with wide-ranging interests who edited important dance magazines in London and New York, co-edited a dance encyclopedia and taught dance history, died on Monday at Deaconess Hospital in Cincinnati. She was 91 and lived in Clifton, Ohio.         The cause was complications of a stroke, said Janet Light, a friend.         Miss Manchester disliked and never used her given name, Phyllis Winifred. She signed her reviews with her first initials and was known to friends and colleagues as Bill. Dance was her passion and she witnessed the final days of Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, the birth of the company that became the Royal Ballet and the formative years of the New York City Ballet.         She could also speak authoritatively on subjects like world literature, the British royal family and baseball, a sport she became devoted to after moving to New York in 1951. She even occasionally served as a radio sports commentator in Cincinnati, discussing baseball games in a refined British accent.         Miss Manchester came to the United States to work as associate editor and principal critic for Dance News, a monthly magazine, and, with its founder, Anatole Chujoy, co-edited  The Dance Encyclopedia, published in 1967. She also wrote dance criticism for The Christian Science Monitor during the 1960's.         Miss Manchester was born in London and worked there as a dance critic for Theater World magazine from 1941 to 1943.         She attracted widespread attention in 1942 with ''Vic-Wells: A Ballet Progress,'' a book appraising the company now known as the Royal Ballet. The work was considered so shrewd that Miss Manchester was often asked if she had personal connections to the company's staff. But at the time, she had none. That same year, however, she became directly involved with another troupe by serving as secretary to Marie Rambert, director of the Ballet Rambert.         Miss Manchester resigned in 1946 to found a monthly magazine called Ballet Today. Its success and her succinct prose led Mr. Chujoy to invite her to Dance News. When Mr. Chujoy died in 1969, he willed her his magazine. But she decided to sell it and accept an offer to teach at the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music, remaining there until she retired in 1993.         She also taught at the University of Utah and the North Carolina School of the Arts and was an adjudicator, arranging programs for regional ballet festivals.         Miss Manchester took an active part in Cincinnati civic life and for several years was host of a weekly radio dance program there. In 1975, a grant from the National Endowment for the Arts enabled her to prepare a series of radio programs on dance history. She received the Dance Magazine Award in 1988.         She is survived by nieces and nephews in Britain and the United States.       
         Mary Elizabeth Grenander, a longtime professor of English who was an authority on the American writer Ambrose Bierce, known for his satirical wit and his horror stories, died in her sleep on Thursday at her home in East Berne, N.Y. She was 79.         Professor Grenander, known as M. E. Grenander, taught at the State University of New York at Albany  from 1948 until she retired in 1989 as a Distinguished Service Professor of English. She was a former president of the New York American Studies Association.         Her many writings about Bierce, who was born in 1842 and went to Mexico in 1913 and vanished, appeared during more than two decades. Analyzing horror stories he wrote, she once said: ''The actual situation is harmful, with the protagonist conceiving it to be harmless and reacting accordingly.''         She edited and wrote the introduction for the book ''Poems of Ambrose Bierce'' (1995, Nebraska), which the literary journal American Notes and Queries, or ANQ, called ''a provocative volume'' that ''should spark further interest in Bierce.''         Professor Grenander received a Fulbright Fellowship and grants from institutions including the National Endowment for the Humanities, the New York Council for the Humanities and the Rockefeller Foundation.         She gave more than $1 million to SUNY Albany, including $500,000 to establish a professorship in memory of her husband, James W. Corbett, a  professor of physics at the same university, who died in 1994. Lisa James of the university's Office of University Relations said that Professor Grenander and her husband prospered ''through long-term investments in the stock market.''         She was born in Rewey, Wis., and received bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate, all in English from the University of Chicago, in the 1940's.         Her marriage to Jean Louis Auclair ended in divorce. She married Professor Corbett in 1972.         She is survived by two sisters, Charlotte White of Puyallup, Wash.,  and Karen Hanley of Miami, Fla.       
         Lois Mailou Jones, an American painter and an art teacher for almost a half century at Howard University in Washington, died at her home in Washington on Tuesday. She was 92.         Ms. Jones was an iconic figure, and an important historic link in a path-breaking generation of black American artists. Her eclectic, academic work, in a career spanning nearly 70 years, ranged from impressionistic landscapes to political allegories, and from cubistic depictions of African sculptures to realistic portraits.         She was influential as a teacher, not only for her exacting standards and the encouragement she gave students, but as an example of persistence in a climate unfavorable to black and women artists.         Ms. Jones was born in Boston in 1905. Her mother was a beautician, her father a building superintendent who became a lawyer. In high school she took evening drawing classes at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts and she had her first solo show at 17 on Martha's Vineyard in Massachusetts. There she met the sculptor Meta Vaux Warrick Fuller, one of the first artists to use black and African subjects positively, who encouraged her ambitions.         After graduate study in art and design in Boston, and then a stint teaching art at Palmer Memorial Institute in Sedalia, N.C., Ms. Jones joined the faculty of Howard University in 1930.         The next year, her work was included in the biennial exhibition of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington. It was the first of several appearances at the Corcoran and in  other group shows, though Ms. Jones  said that early on she asked white friends to deliver her paintings to exhibitions, after having had an award rescinded when it was discovered that she was black.         In 1934, while attending a summer session at Columbia University, she was exposed to the cultural life of Harlem, and began studying the African masks that would become central to her best-known paintings.         In 1937, she received a fellowship to travel to Europe. She studied in Paris for a year and produced one of her most widely exhibited paintings, ''Les Fetiches'' (1938), an image of five African masks rendered in a  modernist style. The work has become an emblem of black American self-identity and is on view in the exhibition ''Rhapsodies in Black: Art of the Harlem Renaissance'' at the Corcoran Gallery, where a small memorial show of the artist's work has been organized.         After marrying the Haitian artist Louis Vergniaud Pierre-Noel in 1953, Ms. Jones visited Haiti frequently, and in the 1960's and '70's she traveled in Africa. There she interviewed contemporary artists as part of a  project sponsored by Howard University titled ''The Black Visual Artists,'' for which she also documented the work of artists in the Caribbean and the United States. Both Haitian and African themes were crucial to her work.         Throughout these years, Ms. Jones taught at Howard University and elsewhere. She instructed generations of black artists, among them the contemporary sculptor Martha Jackson-Jarvis and the painter and collagist David C. Driskell, and some of whom, like Mr. Driskell, are also  teachers.         Ms. Jones retired as professor emeritus from Howard in 1977 but continued her career as an artist and lecturer, and exhibited in the United States, Europe and Asia. In 1980, she was one of 10 Africa-American artists honored by President Jimmy Carter for outstanding achievement in the arts, and she received honorary degrees from several American colleges and universities. Her work is in numerous public collections, among them those of the National Museum of American Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington and the Museum of Fine Art.         Ms. Jones's husband died in 1982 and she has no immediate survivors.       
         Gloria F. Ross, a widely known tapestry maker who brought painters and weavers together to create contemporary wall hangings, died on Sunday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, her son Clifford A. Ross said.         Translating paint into wool, as she put it, Ms. Ross worked with Robert Motherwell, Louise Nevelson, Jean Dubuffet, Frank Stella, Jack Youngerman, Romare Bearden and more than two dozen other artists to make tapestries of their paintings. The actual weaving was done by professionals in Felletin, a small French town near Aubusson, and at the Dovecot Studios in Edinburgh, although Ms. Ross played a hands-on role in the process.         During the 1980's, realizing that the chevrons and targets of Kenneth Noland's paintings were a perfect match for the Navajo loom and color range, Ms. Ross developed a series designed by Mr. Noland and hand-woven by Navajo weavers in Arizona and New Mexico.         Her tapestries were collected by individuals, corporations and museums. Work by Motherwell and Helen Frankenthaler rendered as tapestries, for example, hangs in the entrance to the Philadelphia Convention Center, and museums owning Ross tapestries include the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, the Art Institute of Chicago, the Textile Museum in Washington and the Denver Art Museum.         In 1997, although retired from professional work, Ms. Ross was active in the production of an ark curtain designed by Mark Podwol for Temple Emanu-El in New York. That year she also founded the Gloria F. Ross Center for Tapestry Studies in Tucson, Ariz., a nonprofit research institute and educational foundation. The center grew from her belief in tapestry as ''a vital contemporary art form with rich historical connections,'' said Dr. Ann Lane Hedlund, chairman of its board. The center sponsors public lectures, workshops, research projects and exhibitions devoted to tapestries, from prehistory to the present.         During her travels in the Southwest, Ms. Ross collected Navajo rugs and other textiles of native design, which she donated to the Denver Art Museum. An exhibition of them organized by the museum and supported by the National Endowment for the Arts toured the country from 1992 to 1997, ending at the National Museum of the American Indian in New York.         Born in New York on Sept. 5, 1923, Ms. Ross was the daughter of Justice Alfred Frankenthaler of the New York State Supreme Court and Martha Lowenstein Frankenthaler. She graduated from Mount Holyoke College in 1943. Her first marriage, to Arthur Ross, ended in divorce in 1970. In 1975, she married Dr. John Bookman, a nutrition and diabetes specialist at Mount Sinai Medical Center. He died in 1988.         Ms. Ross served on the Mount Holyoke College board of trustees from 1986 to 1991, and on the advisory board of the college's art museum from 1975 on. Since 1991 she had been an active trustee of the Textile Museum.         Besides her son Clifford, she is survived by another son, Alfred F. Ross, of New York City; a daughter, Beverly Ross; two sisters, Marjorie Iseman and Helen Frankenthaler, the artist, both of New York; a stepdaughter, Ann Bookman of Brookline, Mass.; a stepson, Richard Bookman of Coral Gables, Fla.; two grandchildren, four step-grandchildren and her companion, Henry Kohn, also of New York.         Correction:  June 26, 1998, Friday  An obituary of the tapestry designer Gloria F. Ross on Tuesday misstated the position of Dr. Ann Lane Hedlund at the Gloria F. Ross Center for Tapestry Studies in Tucson, Ariz. She is the center's director, not head of its board.       
         Dorothy Stickney, who created the role of the mother in ''Life with Father'' and also appeared in many other Broadway hits during a career that spanned more than 50 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 101.         ''Life with Father,'' by Howard Lindsay (Miss Stickney's husband) and Russel Crouse, opened at the Empire Theater on Nov. 8, 1939. When it closed after seven years and 3,224 performances, it was -- and it still is today -- the longest running nonmusical show in Broadway history. The Lindsays, who were among the most celebrated acting couples in the United States, played the leading roles of Clarence and Vinnie Day for five years. Based on Clarence Day's reminiscences about his youth in New York in the 1880's, the play told the story of a large family, led by a frequently exasperated father tempered by his charming wife who put up with all his crotchets.         The play was turned down by Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne and many other stars. Finally it was tried out in summer stock at the Lakewood Theater in Skowhegan, Me., with Mr. Lindsay and Miss Stickney thrust into the leading roles. As Miss Stickney said: ''We weren't at all sure we were good enough for the parts. We had never originally intended to play them ourselves.''         Success in summer stock eventually led to Broadway, and opening night was filled with minor disasters. In the first scene the actress playing the maid accidentally dropped a tray of dishes, and, later, several actors forgot their lines. As Miss Stickney remembered, she and her husband went home and cried: ''Little did we realize that the play would last through World War II.''         Mr. Lindsay attributed the phenomenal success to the fact that the play was not just a comedy but also had a tender, familial side: ''People who see 'Life with Father' are emotionally moved as well as amused. They see so much of themselves in the characters on the stage. Booth Tarkington summed it up well when he said the play is in reality 'promptings to memory.' ''         At the heart of the play -- and of its tenderness -- was Miss Stickney's performance as the wise and patient mother, Vinnie, who was understanding without being overly sentimental. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said her portrait was ''brilliant acting, both sweet and witty, with a supple response to the storminess of her domestic economy.''         The Lindsays returned to their roles in 1947 -- when the play set a record of 3,183 performances -- staying in the cast for several weeks. The following year, they played the Days again, in the sequel, ''Life with Mother,'' and that play ran for a year. When the original Empire Theater (where both plays first opened) was demolished in 1953, the couple salvaged two red plush orchestra seats and placed them in their elegant East Side town house.         Miss Stickney was born in Dickinson, N.D. Her father, Victor Hugo Stickney, a doctor who made calls on horseback, was one of the first 10 members elected to the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. Stage-struck from an early age, she studied at the North Western Dramatic School in Minneapolis, sang and danced as one of the four ''Southern Belles'' in vaudeville and acted with various stock companies. When she came to New York in the 1920's, she was turned down for so many roles that she wrote a poem about the experience. The poem, called ''You're Not the Type,'' was published in Liberty magazine and was the beginning of her sideline literary career.         For two summers she was the featured ingenue in summer stock at the Lakewood Theater, then returned to New York to look for work. In New York, she met Mr. Lindsay, who was writing vaudeville sketches. When he was hired to direct the next summer at Lakewood, he was told he could choose his own company, except for the ingenue, a role reserved for the popular Miss Stickney. They were married in 1927.         After making her Broadway debut in 1926 in a small role in ''The Squall,'' she soon became known for playing eccentric characters and was in one hit after another. She was  Liz, a mad scrub woman, in ''Chicago,'' the first Broadway show directed by George Abbott. In ''The Front Page,'' she created the role of Mollie Molloy, the woman who jumps out an open courthouse window. That was followed by George Kelly's ''Philip Goes Forth,'' Rose Franken's ''Another Language'' (her first important role), Paul Osborn's ''On Borrowed Time'' and many other plays. She was a character actress who had become a star.         At the same time, as playwright and director, her husband was himself enjoying halcyon days. He and Mr. Crouse had collaborated on the book for ''Anything Goes'' and other musicals, before they began writing their adaptation of the Clarence Day stories.         After ''Life with Father,'' Miss Stickney was in, among other plays, ''The Small Hours,'' ''To Be Continued,'' ''Kind Sir'' and ''The Honeys.'' Her films included ''The Little Minister'' and ''I Never Sang for My Father.'' On television she played a bootlegger in the first episode of ''The Waltons.''         As an admirer of Edna St. Vincent Millay, she wrote ''A Lovely Light,'' a one-woman play based on Millay's poetry and letters. As with ''Life with Father,'' she tried it out in summer stock before bringing it to Broadway in 1960, in a production directed by her husband. The actress toured the show at colleges and universities and later brought it back to Broadway. In 1967, she did a revival of ''Life with Father'' at City Center, with Leon Ames as co-star.         Her husband died in 1968. No immediate family members survive.         In 1973, Miss Stickney returned to the stage and made her Broadway musical debut in ''Pippin,'' taking over the role of Berthe after the death of Irene Ryan. She sang one song, ''No Time at All.'' Previously, she had been in several musicals on television. She and her husband played the king and queen in Rodgers and Hammerstein's ''Cinderella'' in 1957, and in 1968 she appeared in Stephen Sondheim's ''Evening Primrose.''         In her 1979 memoir, ''Openings and Closings,'' Miss Stickney, who seemed to be the most quietly confident actress onstage, wrote about her lifelong battle with stage fright. She said she had learned one lesson: ''When panic overtook me and I felt absolutely unable to go on, I would tell myself, 'You don't have to do the whole play -- you don't even have to play the next scene -- all you have to do is say the next line.' '' Although she never fully conquered that fear, she was always able to say the next line and the next line, and in so doing found a lifetime of accomplishment in the theater.       
         Shirley Polykoff, the pioneering advertising woman who came up with a single double-entendre that changed the face, or rather turned the heads, of American society, died on Thursday at her home on Park Avenue. She was 90 and the author of the ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' slogan, which unleashed American women to choose the color of their hair.         In an era when hair color is no longer a fiat of nature but a routine fashion choice, it is easy to forget that as recently as the mid-1950's hair coloring was such an exotic exception to a cultural norm that only 7 percent of American women dared dye their hair, mainly actresses, models and other fast women.         Then in 1956 Miss Polykoff invented the ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' campaign for a tiny Bristol-Myers division known as Clairol. Almost overnight, the slogan became a national catch phrase, and dyed hair (although never thereafter, she made sure, known that way) went from declasse to de rigueur.         Attracted by the slogan and its reassuring tag line, ''Hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure,'' within a decade nearly half of all American women were regularly coloring their hair, and sales of dyes, tints and rinses had soared from $25 million to $200 million a year, with Clairol accounting for more than half the total (as it does today with industry sales of more than $1 billion).         Once the lone female copywriter at the giant Foote, Cone & Belding advertising agency, Miss Polykoff became the agency's lone female executive vice president, the toast of Madison Avenue and the 1967 Advertising Woman of the Year.         For the Brooklyn-born middle daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants, especially one whose mother wanted her to be a boy, the triumph was hardly a fluke. From the time she was 11 and made ''$3 and change'' for 12 hours' work selling coats in a Brooklyn department store, Miss Polykoff had relished proving herself in the traditional masculine role of breadwinner.         By the time she arrived at Foote, Cone & Belding in time to take over the new Clairol account in 1955, Miss Polykoff, who had written her first advertising copy as a teen-age secretary at Harper's Bazaar, had long since established herself as a star in retail advertising, first for a series of department and variety stores, including Bamberger's and Kresge in Newark, then for New York agencies with retail accounts.         As one of the few women in a male-dominated industry selling almost exclusively to women, the traditional household purchasing agents, Miss Polykoff had an advantage over her sometimes obtuse colleagues, particularly those who told her the proposed ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' campaign was too suggestive.         In her 1975 book, ''Does She . . . or Doesn't She? And How She Did It,'' Miss Polykoff recalled that when similarly obtuse executives at Life magazine turned down a 10-page Clairol layout because of the double-entendre, she challenged them to poll the women in the magazine office.         When the dirty-minded executives could not find a single woman who thought the line had any smutty connotation, Miss Polykoff was not surprised. She had realized all along that well brought-up women of the 1950's, the Clairol target audience, would never admit, as she put it, ''that a nice girl ever got an off-color meaning about anything.'' The ad ran, and, as she recalled, ''everybody got rich.''         To some latter-day feminists, Miss Polykoff was somewhat perplexing, on the one hand an obvious pioneering role model for professional women, on the other a woman whose success, which included such campaigns as ''Is It True Blondes Have More Fun?'' and ''If I've Only One Life to Live, Let Me Live It as a Blonde,'' depended on catering to women's vanity as sex objects.         Miss Polykoff, who frankly used her femininity to charm men and who chided modern businesswomen who try to ape men, did not apologize. For all her ambition and outsized success as a woman, Miss Polykoff was cut from a pre-feminist mold, never forgetting, as she often put it, that she was ''a girl first and an advertising woman second.''         Growing up as the awkward middle daughter between two raven-haired beauties, Miss Polykoff, who saw her blond hair as her only physical distinction (at least until she began to develop what she called her ''sexy curves''), was so distraught when her hair began to darken as a teen-ager that she began having a local hairdresser lighten it, just to make the back match the front. That fiction sufficed until her future mother-in-law secretly asked her son the Yiddish foreshadowing of ''Does she  . . . or doesn't she?''         Miss Polykoff also unabashedly put husband and family above her career, going so far as to hold her Foote, Cone salary to $25,000 so as not to earn more than her lawyer husband, George P. Halperin. After he died in 1961, the agency doubled her salary twice in less than a decade, and when she retired in 1973 to open an agency under her own name she had been Foote, Cone's highest paid salaried employee for many years.         She is survived by two daughters, Laurie Zucker of Athens, Ohio, and Alix Nelson Frick of Manhattan, the president of Franklin Spier Advertising; a sister, Lillian Ovberg of Glen Cove, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  June 15, 1998, Monday  An obituary last Monday about Shirley Polykoff, the advertising woman who devised the slogan ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' in 1956 to advertise hair coloring products, referred incorrectly to the ownership of the advertiser, Clairol. The company was independent at the time. It was acquired in 1959 by the Bristol-Myers Company, now Bristol-Myers Squibb.       
         Betty Lehan Harragan, a writer, consultant and advocate for women's equality in the workplace, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was lung cancer, according to Kathleen Harragan, her daughter.         Betty Harragan's book ''Games Mother Never Taught You: Corporate Gamesmanship for Women'' was published in 1977 by Rawson Associates; since then, more than one million copies have been published in paperback by Warner Books. The book is used in college undergraduate courses and business schools and was the basis for a television film of the same name starring Loretta Swit and Sam Waterston, broadcast by CBS in 1982 and 1985.         Another book by Ms. Harragan, ''Knowing the Score: Play-by-Play Directions for Women on the Job,'' was published by St. Martin's Press in 1983. Ms. Harragan also wrote articles and columns about careers for such magazines as Working Woman, Woman's Day, Mademoiselle and Savvy.         A 27-year member of the National Organization for Women, for which she frequently handled publicity and public relations, Ms. Harragan often addressed professional societies and seminars for female managers. She also testified before legislative committees on behalf of equal opportunity, equal rights and comparable pay for women.         A native of Milwaukee, she graduated from Marquette University in there in 1944. She received a master's degree in English literature in 1947 from Columbia University.         From 1950 to 1956, she edited employee publications for the New York Telephone Company and was a writer and publicist at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency from 1963 to 1972. Later that year, Ms. Harragan started Betty Harragan & Affiliates, a consulting company that specialized in women's issues in the workplace.         Her husband, David J., died in 1962.         In addition to her daughter, Kathleen, of Boston, she is survived by three brothers, Robert Lehan of Tempe, Ariz.; Richard Lehan of Sacramento, Calif., and William Lehan of Anaheim, Calif.; two sisters, Geri Pollack of North Hills, Calif., and Judy Ascasio of Laguna Hills, Calif., and a grandson.       
         Chana Timoner, a onetime housewife with such a passionate devotion to tradition and social justice that she became first a rabbi and then the first Jewish woman to serve as a full-time Army chaplain, died on Monday at her home in New Haven. She was 46 and had received a medical discharge earlier this year after developing the Epstein-Barr virus.         Her husband, Dr. Julian Timoner, a chiropractor who persuaded state authorities to release the body without an autopsy, said he believed that his wife had accidentally taken a fatal overdose combination of her prescribed medication and her usual sleeping pills.         Anyone who was surprised when Ms. Timoner, then a self-styled housewife and couch potato, began five years of intense religious training at age 33 or who was surprised even more when she entered the Army and endured six weeks of grueling basic training at age 39, simply had not been paying attention.         For Ms. Timoner, a New Haven native whose father was a railroad carpenter, religion, the military and pushing limits were all family traditions.         Her Russian-born maternal grandfather had been a rabbi in New Haven, and her mother had been so eager to fight the Nazis in World War II that she joined the Canadian Army in 1940, a year before the United States entered the war and she was able to transfer to the newly organized Women's Army Corps.         By the time Ms. Timoner enrolled in Southern Connecticut State College in New Haven, she had developed expansive dreams that included later study at the University of Jerusalem.         Then she made the mistake of dropping by a local Jewish community center one night. Dr. Timoner was there, too, and, well, it's an old story, and by the time she began giving it her own personal twist, Ms. Timoner had been married at 18, had had two children by the time she graduated and had endured a grin-and-bear-it decade as a distinctly restless housewife and mother.         Ms. Timoner, who had always been deeply involved in religion and who had been struggling with herself over whether to become a rabbi, attributed her decision to begin religious studies in 1984 to a friend who told her one day: ''You know, in 7 years you could be a 40-year-old housewife or you could be a 40-year-old rabbi.''         The next day, Ms. Timoner said, ''I was on the phone,'' finding out how to enter rabbinical training.         She enrolled in the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York and spent the next five years making long daily trips to New York City. Then, after her ordination in 1989, she spent two more commuting years studying for a doctorate at the New York Theological Seminary, completing the course work but deferring her dissertation.         Although she was far from the first woman to become a rabbi, most had been affiliated with the liberal Reform Jewish tradition, and as a committed adherent of the more austere Conservative tradition, Rabbi Timoner had trouble finding a post.         Then when she did find one, as rabbi of the Beth El Synagogue in Wallingford, Conn., her career ran afoul of her own principles. When she refused to bend the rules to perform a bar mitzvah for a youth with a Jewish father and a gentile mother without the required religious circumcision ritual, she was forced to step down.         After working for the National Council of Christians and Jews and as a hospital chaplain, Rabbi Timoner joined the Army Reserves and in 1993 became the first Jewish woman to serve as a full-time chaplain in the regular Army.         On the day in 1993 that she began her first assignment, at Fort Bragg, N.C., her husband recalled yesterday, President Clinton announced his ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on homosexuals in the military, prompting Rabbi Timoner to make an announcement of her own: she would gladly provide a full range of counseling for gay soldiers.         The position, which shocked her fellow chaplains at the base, was simply par for the Timoner course. When she had learned that homosexuals, even those with the AIDS virus, were being shunned by the Jewish religious establishment in Connecticut, she formed study groups for Jewish homosexuals and became active in AIDS organizations.         As the only Jewish chaplain at Fort Bragg, Rabbi Timoner held regular Friday services for the few Jewish soldiers at the base, but as the chaplain for a helicopter battalion there she spent most of her time counseling the soldiers, many of them women, none of them Jewish.         After a brief stint in Korea, where the Epstein-Barr virus and the related chronic fatigue syndrome were first diagnosed, Captain Timoner completed her Army service at Fort Benning, Ga., where, as usual, she made waves, especially when she insisted on adding prayers for Catholic, gay and gypsy victims of the Nazi terror at a Holocaust service.         No one should have been surprised. After all, when Elie Wiesel once addressed a large Jewish gathering at Yale and made an impassioned reference to ''the six million,'' Rabbi Timoner, who was sitting on the first row, had felt compelled to stand and chide him for not including the other oppressed groups who died in the gas chambers.         In addition to her husband, Rabbi Timoner is survived by her mother, Mary Surasky of Tampa, Fla.; a daughter, Aviva, of Paris; a son, Samson, of Germantown, Md.; a sister, Abby Sawilowsky, of Oak Park, Mich., and two brothers, Miron Surasky of Oakland, Calif., and Charles Surasky of Yardley, Pa.       
         Edith Appleton Standen, one of the world's leading authorities on tapestries and a longtime curator at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died last weekend at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Ms. Standen's writings, which include an award-winning, two-volume catalogue of the Met's European post-medieval tapestries, helped broaden the interest in her speciality, which was one she never set out to have. When the Met's director offered her a curatorial position in charge of its Textile Study Room in 1949, she said yes, but added that he should know three things: she didn't know much about textiles; she cared less than most women about fashion, and she never used a needle and thread unless she had to. The subject took: until a month ago, she was at the Metropolitan every day at 9 A.M., said Thomas Campbell, an associate curator.         She was born in Halifax, Nova Scotia, the daughter of a British Army officer, and spent her childhood in Ireland and England. She received an honors degree in English from Somerville College, Oxford University, in 1926, and immigrated to the United States two years later. In Boston, she went to work for the Society for the Preservation of New England Antiquities, founded by William Sumner Appleton, her uncle.         She is survived by a sister-in-law, Lisl Standen.         Ms. Standen also did volunteer work for the photo collection of Harvard University's Fogg Art Museum. She was invited to take the legendary museum course taught by Paul J. Sachs, the Fogg's associate director. In 1929 she was hired by Joseph Widener as secretary to his art collections. This position lasted until he gave the works to the National Gallery of Art in 1942. With World War II  under way, Ms. Standen became an American citizen and joined the Women's Army Corps, ending up in Ohio working for the Air Force. In 1945, she was sent to Europe as a member of the American Military Government's Monuments, Fine Arts and Archives Section, the group that preserved, restored and returned art plundered during the war to its rightful owners. In early 1946, she took over management of the Weisbaden Collecting Point.         Ms. Standen, who remained single all her life, worked at the Met until 1970, organizing exhibitions and writing and lecturing on textiles and paintings. Besides her 1985 catalogue, ''European Post-Medieval Tapestries and Related Hangings in the Metropolitan Museum of Art,'' she published more than 50 articles.         After her retirement, she remained a consultant to the Met until 1988. In 1986, she began to compile a biennial newsletter about tapestries, which she distributed in the academic world. She had just completed her final article, about Beauvais tapestries, which Mr. Campbell said was to be published posthumously in the Metropolitan Museum Journal. Her archives and books are expected to be left to the Metropolitan.       
         Lillian Hoban, who illustrated or wrote more than 100 children's books, including those featuring a badger named Frances and a chimpanzee named Arthur, died on July 17 at New York and Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan and in Wilton, Conn.         The cause was heart failure, said her principal publisher, HarperCollins Children's Books.         Ms. Hoban's best-known works explored the trials and tribulations of early childhood. She first established herself as an illustrator in the 1960's, providing the drawings for the ''Frances'' series written by her husband, Russell Hoban, a prolific author of children's books. She illustrated his ''Baby Sister for Frances'' (1964) and drew the pictures for five more books in that series about Frances and her family.         After the couple divorced in 1975, she began writing and illustrating an ''I Can Read Books'' series about Arthur and his little sister, Violet. An 11th title, ''Arthur's Birthday Party,'' is due out early next year.         Born in Philadelphia, Lillian Aberman Hoban attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Art, studied dance with Martha Graham and taught modern dance in New York and Connecticut. She also danced on television during the 1950's.         She taught herself to draw still lifes, using crayons and pastels, and started writing stories after she had her own children, basing her tales on their everyday adventures.         Ms. Hoban is survived by three daughters, Phoebe, and Julia, both  of Manhattan, and Esme, of Wilton; a son, Brom, of Austin, Tex.; a sister, Esther Man of Los Angeles, and six grandchildren.         Ms. Hoban was active in civic affairs in Wilton, particularly at the Wilton Library.         She also played a prominent role in the National Arts Club's creative writing program for public-school children, hoping to whet their taste for reading and writing.         ''When I am writing, I like writing best, and when I am drawing, I like drawing best,'' she once said. ''But probably what I like better than anything is just messing around with color.''       
         Dorothy West, ''the Kid'' of the  Harlem Renaissance circle of writers and artists in the 1920's who was rediscovered seven decades later when her novel ''The Wedding'' was published and became a best-seller,  died on Sunday night at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard.         Miss West, who began writing stories at age 7 in her family's elegant four-story house in Boston, was not yet 20 in 1926 when her short  story ''The Typewriter'' won a prize from the Urban League's Opportunity magazine. Encouraged, she  moved to Harlem and joined the poets, novelists, musicians and other artists forging a cultural renaissance there. Long before her death, she was frequently described as the last surviving member of that group.         ''We thought we were going to be the greatest writers in the world,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. 'We were all young and we fell in love with each other. We all had the same ambitions: writers and painters and so forth. We were free. . . .We had an innocence that nobody can have now.''         Langston Hughes gave Miss West the nickname ''the Kid'' and took her to Russia in 1932. She asked him to marry her but he declined. Soon she received a proposal from Countee Cullen, the poet who received one of the first Guggenheim Fellowships given to an African-American. She turned him down. She shared an apartment with Zora Neale Hurston, the writer and folklorist, and when guests came to the loft of Wallace Thurman, the novelist and editor, she was always there, sitting on the floor.  She had a bit part in the original stage production of ''Porgy and Bess.'' Claude McKay, already established as a poet and novelist, scolded her for not writing more.         ''We were a beautiful, young group,'' she told a Boston Globe interviewer in 1989. 'We drank too much, though. We drank too much.''         Miss West's first novel, ''The Living Is Easy,'' was not published until  1948, when the Harlem Renaissance had long faded. Her second, ''The  Wedding,'' about the aspirations and anxieties of black people living on Martha's Vineyard, appeared in 1995. Both were written at her family's former vacation home on the  Vineyard, where she had lived year-round since 1947 and was a columnist for The Vineyard Gazette.         At her celebrity-studded 90th birthday party on the island in 1997, which drew hundreds of well-wishers, she was called ''a national treasure'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton.         Miss West's stories and novels used brisk narratives, an eye for detail and wit to explore the aspirations of well-to-do blacks and the interplay of race, class and intraracial tensions in America. Her work was not overtly political, tending to more lyrical depictions of vanity, longing, love and misunderstanding.         ''Color is important, but class is more important,'' Miss West often said in the dozens of interviews she gave after ''The Wedding'' was published by Doubleday and made into a  miniseries by Oprah Winfrey.         Critics praised her storytelling and her pioneering descriptions of  conflict within the black middle class. ''There is an abundance of  psychological and historic richness to her characters,'' Elizabeth Benedict wrote in The Washington Post in 1995, ''and she can be wickedly eloquent about the costs of living in a world where the shadings in the color of one's skin are more important than the bonds between blood relatives.''         Miss West was born on June 2, 1907, in Boston, the only child of Isaac and Rachel West. Her father, born a slave, built a fruit and vegetable business that lifted the family into the slim ranks of Boston's black upper middle class. Her mother, a generation younger, ''spirited, fearless, sassy and smart,'' brought many of her 18 siblings and their families to live with them.         Family members ''ranged in color from the blond child to me,'' Miss  West wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' a collection of short stories and essays published in 1995. ''We were always stared at. . . . My mother prepared us. As she marched us down our front stairs, she would say what our smiles were on tiptoe to hear, 'Come on, children, let's go out and  drive the white folks crazy.'         ''She said it without rancor, and she said it in that outrageous way to  make us laugh. She was easing our entry into a world that outranked us  and outnumbered us. If she could not help us see ourselves with the humor,  however wry, that gives the heart its grace, she would never have forgiven  herself for letting our spirits be crushed before we had learned to  sheathe them with pride.''         The sisters and cousins defended  each other against outsiders, but at home squabbles were melodramatic, Miss West said. ''Surrounded by all these different personalities, each one wanting to be first among equals, I knew I wanted to be a writer.  Living with them was like living inside a story.''         Her work was first published when she was 14, in The Boston Post, and she soon became a regular contributor. After graduating from the Girls' Latin School at 16, she attended Boston University and the Columbia University School of Journalism.         In 1932, she and 20 other black Americans including Langston Hughes, were invited to visit the Soviet Union to work on a proposed movie about racism in America. The film was never made, but Miss West remained in the Soviet Union with Hughes for a year, returning to the United States only when she learned of her father's death.         There remains some question about whether she and Hughes were romantically involved, although she proposed to him in a letter in 1933. In a 1995 interview with The Boston Globe, she said that she never particularly wanted to marry -- ''Seemed like the man just became the woman's child'' -- but had wanted a child.  The memory of how she learned she could not was still painful decades later: the white doctor telling her briskly, ''There are already enough black people in the world.''         Miss West had no immediate survivors, although she remained close to many of her cousins.         In 1934, she founded Challenge, a quarterly magazine intended as a showcase for younger black writers and ''to recapture in the mid-30's the literary vitality of the Harlem Renaissance, which had not survived the Depression.'' Her subsequent magazine, New Challenge -- which reflected the belief of its associate editor, Richard Wright, that art is a weapon -- survived only briefly in 1937.         Miss West became a welfare investigator in Harlem (a job that was the source for several short stories)  and joined the Depression-era Federal Writers Project. In 1940, she began contributing two short stories a month at $50 apiece to The New York Daily News, an association she continued until 1960.         In the summer of 1947, she left New York for good, moving to Martha's Vineyard and the two-bedroom cedar-shingled cottage in Oak Bluffs that her father had bought. She lived there the rest of her life, once writing: ''I have lived in various places, but the island is my yearning place.  All my life, wherever I have been, abroad, New York, Boston, anywhere, whenever I yearned for home, I yearned for the island.''         ''The Living Is Easy'' was published the next year. In this semiautobiographical tale, the strong-willed, light-skinned Cleo Judson -- modeled on Miss West's mother -- tries to remake her darker-skinned  daughter, and breaks up her own  marriage to a former slave who had made himself ''the Black Banana King.'' The book satirizes upper-crust black Bostonians.         In the late 1940's, Miss West began writing columns for The Vineyard Gazette.. While caring for ailing relatives in the now-winterized cottage, she was also slowly writing another novel, published as ''The Wedding'' in 1995. (''The Richer, The Poorer,''  gathering 13 essays and 17 stories Miss West wrote between 1926 and 1987, came out later the same year.)         Starting in 1992, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, then a book editor for Doubleday, had visited the cottage once a week in the summers to work on the long-stalled novel with Miss  West. Mrs. Onassis died shortly before its publication, and Miss West dedicated it to her memory, writing,  ''Though there was never such a mismatched pair in appearance, we were perfect partners.''         Set in the black community on Martha's Vineyard during the 1950's, the novel is a gently ironic story of a beautiful, blond, privileged young black woman, Shelby Coles, who is torn about her planned marriage to a white jazz musician. Using flashbacks from the wedding day to many past generations, it delves into interracial and intraracial bigotry. Miss  West's belief in integration and her penchant for romance coalesced in the final line she gave Shelby Coles: ''Color was a false distinction; love  was not.''         Oprah Winfrey used the novel for a two-part miniseries this year. ''It shows a world that most people have rarely seen, a world where black  families are all highly educated, very successful, living in Martha's  Vineyard,'' Miss Winfrey said.         An energetic conversationalist and inveterate storyteller who was less than five feet tall, Miss West kept her distance from the political upheavals of her lifetime. She went to Communist Russia with Hughes and the others, she wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' because ''I liked them.'' In the 1960's and 70's, Miss West was not active in the civil rights movement and found radicals like the Black Panthers discomfiting.         ''I'm a creative writer,'' she said late in life. ''I'm not a black with a  chip on my shoulder.'' Instead, she often said: ''Color is nothing when you know people.''       
         The Mexican writer Elena Garro, whose novels, plays and stories exploring the clash between illusion and reality in Latin America made her one of Mexico's most important literary figures behind her former husband, Octavio Paz, died on Saturday at  Cuernavaca Hospital, south of Mexico City.         She was 78 and had emphysema, said her daughter, Helena Paz Garro.         While male voices predominate in Latin American literature, Ms. Garro, through acerbic intelligence and lyric intensity, achieved a level of recognition and importance usually barred to women. The president of the National Council for Culture and the Arts in Mexico, Rafael Tovar y de Teresa, labeled Ms. Garro one of the three most important female writers that Mexico had produced, alongside the 17th-century nun and poet Sor Juana de la Cruz and Rosario Castellanos, Ms. Garro's contemporary.         The Mexican literary world ''is in mourning again,'' said Mr. Tovar y de Teresa. Mr. Paz, who won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1990, died on April 19.         In the Mexico City daily Reforma, the writer Carlos Fuentes called Ms. Garro's first book, ''Recollections of Things to Come,'' ''one of the most important Mexican novels of the 20th century.'' It is one of only a handful of her more than 40 works that was  translated into English.         Ms. Garro was born in the pretty colonial town of Puebla, 75 miles from Mexico City. Her marriage to Mr. Paz in 1937 brought her into a circle of intellectuals where her own radical ideas flourished and eventually clashed with those of her contemporaries.         Soon after marrying, she and Mr. Paz moved from Mexico City to Spain to write about the Spanish Civil War. They lived in Paris after World War II and became part of the literary group that included the Argentine poet Jorge Luis Borges and the Surrealist Andre Breton. Later they lived in Japan before returning to Mexico.         Their marriage dissolved in the early 1960's and they never spoke to each other again.         In the late 1960's, Mexico, like many other countries, was immersed in protest and rebellion. The Mexican student movement had been fired in part by the country's intellectual elite. But Ms. Garro turned her back on the movement, at one point calling it a ''crazy adventure.''         Her remarks stirred open hostility and brought about an almost complete break with Mexico's literary community. She moved to New York, and later to Paris, remaining in exile for 23 years before returning to Mexico in November 1991.         She found a changed country, which she found hard to accept, and became like a character in ''Recollections of Things to Come'' who tried to step out of time by stopping the clock at the end of every day.         Still, Ms. Garro continued to write provocatively and successfully. This  March, the English translations of two of her novellas, ''First Love'' and ''Look for My Obituary,'' were published by Curbstone.         In a review in The New York Times, Peter Bricklebank said the works possessed ''understated eloquence,'' with characters who are ''prisoners of their own solitude, shackled by social expectations.''         Besides her novels and stories, she  wrote eight works for the theater, including ''A Solid Home'' (1957), ''The Tree'' (1963) and ''Felipe Angeles'' (1979). Upon her return to Mexico in 1991, she was honored for her life's work at the National Theater Program in Aguascalientes.         Ms. Garro spent her last years with her daughter and more than a dozen cats in a two-bedroom apartment in Cuernavaca.       
         Sister Irene Kraus, a onetime schoolteacher with such a high-spirited talent for leadership and such hard-nosed business ability that she went on to run a series of hospitals and spend six years as the founding chief executive of the $3 billion Daughters of Charity National Health System, died Aug. 20 at a hospital in Baltimore. She was 74 and lived in Emmitsburg, Md., where she was administrator of her order's provincial headquarters.         Friends said the cause was cancer.         While it is tempting to speculate on what direction her life might have taken if she had not joined the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, in an era when women's horizons were bounded largely by home and family, it would be hard to find a secular career path that would have allowed her to become president of the nation's largest nonprofit hospital chain.         But then for Sister Irene, who grew up in Philadelphia, the religious life seems to have been a foregone family conclusion. Like her business acumen and her boundless good humor, her religious commitment seems to have come from her father, Frank, a Pennsylvania Railroad executive with a weakness for practical jokes and such a spiritual bent, his daughter later recalled, that ''he would pray all the way to work, and when I went with him, I would pray, too.''         A standout student at the Daughters of Charity's Elizabeth Seton High School in Baltimore, Sister Irene graduated at 17 in 1941 and immediately joined the religious order.         After a year of novitiate training, she spent seven years teaching elementary and high school students in Richmond. Then her superiors decided it was time for her to get a college education and asked her to switch to a medical career.         After earning a nursing degree at the Catholic University of America in Washington in 1952, she quickly became an operating room supervisor, performing her duties at a series of hospitals with such efficiency and flair that three years later she was made administrator of Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton, N.Y., the first of several hospitals nationwide she ran for the order.         When the five autonomous American provinces of the Daughters of Charity decided to consolidate their hospital systems in 1986, Sister Irene was the obvious choice to put the merger into effect and run the operation, which included three dozen hospitals and 19 other operations in 17 states with a combined annual budget of more than $3 billion.         And over the next six years, during a period of mounting fiscal and other pressures, she proved more than equal to the task of meshing often incompatible accounting and other systems into an efficient operation with common purchasing and other functions.         In addition to its embrace of women's potential, the religious order gave Sister Irene other advantages. In a business world where women have had to pick their way through contradictory advice on how to dress for success, Sister Irene never had a wardrobe worry. Whether conducting a board meeting or entertaining at a reception, she wore a version of the same understated habit, a simple blue dress, she had worn as an elementary school teacher.         If the men she encountered were unaccustomed to dealing with a hard-driving business woman in a habit, Sister Irene, a raconteur with an impish sense of humor, knew how to put them at ease and rarely stopped there. At stodgy gatherings, Sister Irene, a tall, imposing woman with a commanding laugh, would sometimes break into an impromptu dance. And when she got up from her seat at a formal dinner to ''work the room,'' Sister Irene would be easy to track: She inevitably left a trail of laughter in her wake.         During a career in which she served on more than 70 national boards and committees, Sister Irene became accustomed to being the only woman in the room. And in 1980, when she became the first woman to serve as chairman of the American Hospital Association, she headed off a move to call her chairwoman or chairperson. She told the board, ''I didn't work this hard to get here and have my title changed.''         For all her accomplishments as president of the national system, Sister Irene, who later ran a hospital in Pensacola, Fla., and was still vice chairman of the merged Baptist St. Vincent's Hospital system in Jacksonville, Fla., at the time of her death, said her proudest achievement was developing a five-point value system for the national chain. The first four, including treating people with respect and serving the impoverished, sounded like familiar religious principles. The fifth, ''Be Creative to Infinity,'' sounded exactly like Sister Irene.         Sister Irene is survived by three sisters, Gertrude Hunter and Maguerite Williams of Bel Air, Md., and Dolores Freeman of Willards, Md.       
         Anna Jane Harrison, an emeritus professor of chemistry at Mount Holyoke College and the first woman to be president of the 150,000-member American Chemical Society, died on Aug. 8 at Holyoke Hospital. She was 85 and lived in nearby South Hadley, Mass.         The cause was a stroke, the college said.         Dr. Harrison was born on a farm in Benton City, Mo. Her early education was in a one-room country school, and she returned to teach there for two years after graduating from the University of Missouri in 1933.         She then earned an M.A. and a Ph.D. in physical chemistry, also at Missouri, and started her college teaching career at Sophie Newcomb College of Tulane University in 1940.         She joined the faculty at Mount Holyoke College as an assistant professor in 1945, rose to professor in 1950 and headed the department of chemistry from 1960 to 1966.         She became the William R. Kenan Jr. Professor of Chemistry in 1976 and held that post until she retired in 1979.         Dr. Harrison received 20 honorary degrees and won awards from the American Chemical Society in 1977 and 1982 for her contributions as a teacher.         She was active in the society for 62 years and became its president, for a one-year term, in 1978.         Dr. Harrison also served on the National Science Board in the 1970's.         In addition, she was a longtime board member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and in 1984 became its president.         She has no immediate survivors.       
         Florence Griffith Joyner, the three-time gold medalist at the 1988 Summer Olympics who revolutionized women's sprinting with her searing speed and flamboyant fashion sense, died yesterday at her home in Mission Viejo, Calif. She was 38.         Greg Foster, a former champion hurdler and a family friend, said he had spoken with Griffith Joyner's husband, Al Joyner, and with her sister-in-law, the track star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, and had been told that Griffith Joyner was believed to have suffered a heart seizure.         An autopsy was performed yesterday afternoon, but the results were not immediately reported.         Lieut. Hector Rivera, a spokesman for the Orange County sheriff's department, said a 911 call was received yesterday at 6:30 A.M., Pacific time, from Griffith Joyner's husband indicating that she was unresponsive and not breathing. No evidence of foul play was discovered or was expected, Lieutenant Rivera said.         Foster, who is an executive in the marketing firm in St. Louis owned by Joyner-Kersee and who has extensive contact with the family, said he had been told that ''she never woke up this morning.''         Griffith Joyner had suffered a seizure two years ago during a flight and was hospitalized briefly. The family said little about that incident. Bob Kersee, who was Griffith Joyner's coach and who is married to Jackie Joyner-Kersee, said yesterday that there had been no diagnosis of the 1996 incident. As far as he knew, Foster said, ''She was doing fine.''         A decade after her shattering achievements in track and field, Griffith Joyner's sprint records still stand, and many feel they will carry into the next century.         Known by the abbreviation ''FloJo'' -- even her name was fast -- she set the world record for 100 meters at 10.49 seconds at the 1988 Olympic trials in Indianapolis, then established the mark of 21.34 seconds in winning the 200 meters at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, where Griffith Joyner also won gold in the 100 meters and the 4x100-meter relay. She also took a silver medal in the 4x400-meter relay.         Not only did Griffith Joyner run considerably faster than any woman before her or since, she displayed a spectacular flashiness in the way she ran, dressing in one-legged spandex bodysuits and wearing six-inch-long, elaborately decorated fingernails. After retiring in 1989, she designed the uniforms of the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association. And she also served as co-chair of the President's Council on Physical Fitness.         ''We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent and captivated by her style,'' President Clinton said yesterday, praising Griffith Joyner's work with disadvantaged children.         Only now are Griffith Joyner's records even being approached. Marion Jones of the United States ran the 100 in 10.65 seconds this month, and the 200 in 21.62. But even with her present dominance, Jones is still tenths of a second away from Griffith Joyner's records in a sport in which personal bests are usually lowered by hundredths of a second at a time.         ''I think she established herself in sport like Babe Ruth,'' said Terry Crawford, who coached the American women's track and field team at the 1988 Summer Games.         To some, however, Griffith Joyner has come more to symbolize Roger Maris than Babe Ruth, and her accomplishments carry both literal and figurative asterisks. Some have questioned the validity of her 100-meter record because of a possibly faulty wind gauge, and others have questioned whether the stunning times she ran were facilitated by performance-enhancing drugs, something she always denied. She never failed a drug test.         She set the world record in the 100 meters on July 16, 1988, on a day of swirling wind in Indianapolis. The mark of 10.49 seconds was astonishing; it broke Evelyn Ashford's 1984 record by 27-hundredths of a second. In the era of electronic timing, the women's 100-meter record had never been lowered by more than 13-hundredths of a second.         That the wind gauge on the track read 0.0, meaning there was no tail wind or head wind, struck many as illogical, considering that the wind gauge on the nearby triple jump runway showed a reading well above the allowable aiding wind of 4.47 miles an hour. The statistics manual used by track and field's world governing body now includes an asterisk by Griffith Joyner's time and the remarks, ''probably strongly wind assisted.''         Some in Europe have called for a review of the record, but Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of USA Track and Field, the sport's national governing body, said the matter was closed. He called Griffith Joyner a ''ground breaker'' who set standards of speed and flair ''that track and field is still trying to catch up to.'' Crawford, the 1988 Olympic track coach, said: ''There was no wind; I was right there. The track was brand new. It was hot and humid, ideal conditions.''         Because of the significant lowering of her sprint times and her increased musculature in 1988, Griffith Joyner was subjected to rumors and accusations about the possible use of such performance-enhancing drugs as anabolic steroids and human growth hormone.         The most serious allegation was made in 1989 by Darrell Robinson, a former national 400-meter champion, who said that he had sold human growth hormone to Griffith Joyner in 1988. She vehemently denied the charge, calling Robinson a ''compulsive, crazy, lying lunatic.''         ''I have never taken any drugs,''  Griffith Joyner said at the time. ''I don't believe in them. It's a false accusation.''         Yet, it was one that continued to have Griffith Joyner's achievements judged with some ambivalence by her rivals, including Ashford, the former world record-holder at 100 meters who finished second to Griffith Joyner in the 1988 Summer Olympics.         While praising Griffith Joyner's speed and flair, Ashford said yesterday, ''I think, for Florence, the drug issue will always come up, whether she did it or not.''         Griffith Joyner attributed her improved times to weight training, distance running and increased determination after her 1987 marriage to Al Joyner, who had won the triple jump at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. She was not a one-year wonder, having won a silver medal at 200 meters at the 1984 Summer Games. ''I never had any doubt as to the credibility of her records,''  Crawford said.         Delorez Florence Griffith was born Dec. 21, 1959, in the Watts section of Los Angeles, the seventh of 11 children. Her father was an electrical technician and her mother was a teacher.         Always a fashion maverick, she was once asked to leave a shopping mall for wearing her pet boa constrictor around her neck like a feather boa.         According to David Wallechinsky's ''The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics,'' Griffith Joyner began racing as a 7-year-old, but stopped temporarily in 1979, when she withdrew from California State-Northridge to help support her family. Working as a bank teller, she was later persuaded by Coach Bob Kersee to attend U.C.L.A., from which she received a degree in psychology in 1983 and emerging acclaim as a sprinter. Griffith Joyner went into semiretirement after winning an Olympic silver medal in 1984, working in a bank and as a beautician, but she lost weight and returned to serious training in 1987, preparing for her stunning performances a year later.         In addition to her husband, her survivors include their 7-year-old daughter, Mary.       
         Betty Carter, one of jazz's great singers and a composer and arranger whose groups were virtual schools for generations of jazz musicians, died at home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn on Saturday. She was 69.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her friend Ora Harris.         Ms. Carter sounded like no one in jazz, with her own diction, her own phrasing and her own sense of pitch. Though she was firmly inside the jazz-singing tradition, she was an abstractionist as well, and for her words were pliable. On her early material -- she began a solo recording career in the mid-1950's -- her light, pure voice sounded instrumental, with curved, beautifully shaped notes. It was immediately noticeable that she was after something different, and that her technique, always extraordinary, was there to work for her ideas. It was equally clear that she was a jazz musician first and a singer second.         About a decade after beginning her recording career, Ms. Carter refined her originality into a style that became the template for modern jazz singing. On ''Look No Further,'' recorded in 1964, Ms. Carter uses her voice against the bass, then as the band comes in her note choice mirrors the experimentation of instrumentalists like John Coltrane and Miles Davis; during the same session she recorded ''My Favorite Things,'' a composition associated with Mr. Coltrane. Her improvisations were explosive, tumbling out in great leaps at a velocity that expressed unfettered artistic freedom.         But it was artifice. Ms. Carter was one of jazz's most articulate small-group arrangers, and few musicians have ever controlled tempo the way  she had; woe to the young musicians in the band who could not navigate the shockingly abrupt tempo changes or keep up with Ms. Carter's fastest or slowest tempos. Her snapping fingers, marking off the time, sent generations of musicians back to the practice room, chagrined.         In her hands a standard or her own compositions often contrasted some of jazz's slowest tempos with some of its fastest. She wasn't afraid to pare down the instrumentation of a group for a while, singing against piano or bass, orchestrating the arrival of other instruments. And the constant tempo-changing gave the impression of emotional extremity and careful control of the artistic environment. She sculptured sound, and it made her concerts some of the most moving experiences in jazz, a mixture of the emotional power of the songs' texts and the sheer joy of her imagination.         ''I started to change my material to keep the musicians interested,'' Ms. Carter said in a 1992 interview with The New York Times. ''What do you do with a chorus and a half? You change things, stretch them out, change speed. Most musicians I played with were so good they could do what was necessary.''         Ms. Carter grew up in Detroit, which in the 1940's and 1950's was a good environment for jazz musicians, with the city producing some of the best musicians of the time.         Detroit was a stop on the jazz circuit, and a young Ms. Carter sang with Charlie Parker, who came through town. One of her nicknames was Betty Bebop, a tribute to her interests. In 1948 she began working with Lionel Hampton and his band, staying with the vibraphonist until 1951, when, during a performance in New York, she decided to remain there. During the same time she recorded the female part for King Pleasure's version of ''Red Top,'' singing a vocal rendition of Gail Brockman's original trumpet solo.         In New York in 1955 and '56, Ms. Carter began recording for Epic Records and generally taking in the  city. In 1957, she recorded with Wynton Kelly and other peers; her work was irregular partly because her style was more jazz than cabaret, and partly because she tried to avoid  the abusive working situations that have plagued jazz.         In 1961 Ms. Carter recorded what has become a classic album, ''Ray Charles and Betty Carter,'' with Mr. Charles; it features the pair singing astringent duets including a famous version of ''Baby, It's Cold Outside.'' Ms. Carter worked with Mr. Charles from 1960 to 1963, the year she toured Japan with Sonny Rollins and recorded an orchestral album for Atco Records.         Through the 1960's Ms. Carter struggled with her career, recording with Roulette Records in the late 1960's, during which the avant-garde and pop music rendered some artists identified with an older style commercially irrelevant. But in 1969 she started her own recording company, Bet-Car Productions, and on that label she released her albums.         In 1988 Ms. Carter began a relationship with Verve Records that included the reissue of the Bet-Car label along with the recording of a series of new albums. That same year she released ''Look What I Got!,'' which won a Grammy, and in 1994 she recorded an album, ''Feed the Fire,'' with the pianist Geri Allen, the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette.         Also during the 1980's Ms. Carter, finally recognized for her innovations, became a concert draw internationally. She recorded duets with Carmen McRae, and she kept turning out well-rounded musicians, having trained them in her trio. Included in the alumni from the 1980's and the 1990's were the pianists Cyrus Chestnut, Benny Green, Stephen Scott, Marc Cary, Darrell Grant and Travis Shook. And her choice of drummers was extraordinary, having hired Greg Hutchinson, Clarence Penn, Winard Harper, Troy Davis and Lewis Nash. She began receiving numerous awards, including the National Medal of Arts given last year by President Clinton.         In 1993 she began the Jazz Ahead series at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a program that featured young and promising musicians.  This year the Jazz Ahead series was invited to appear at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.         Ms. Carter is survived by two sons, Myles and Kagle Redding, both of New York City. A marriage to James Redding ended in divorce.         ''The survival of jazz culture takes priority,'' Ms. Carter said in the interview with The Times. ''The survival of this culture depends on people playing it and living the life. The young guys playing it in 20 years will be taking the music somewhere else. There was a period where, in jazz, the music sent people away. But it's now back to making people feel better, putting happy smiles on their faces. When I was coming up, that's what jazz was about. It wasn't about money. It was about how happy you could make people.''       
         Dr. Helen Winthrop Edey, a philanthropist and psychiatrist who was active in the field of women's reproductive health and rights, died on Sept. 15 at the Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 86 and lived on Martha's Vineyard and in Manhattan.         Dr. Edey was the former Helen W. Kellogg, a daughter of Morris W. Kellogg, an industrialist who founded the Kellogg Company, a New Jersey-based manufacturer of oil industry equipment. The beneficiaries of her philanthropy included organizations trying to control population growth and to give women the right to choose the number of children they have. She also supported environmental causes and nuclear arms control.         She was a former chairman and a longtime treasurer of the Association for Voluntary Surgical Contraception, which has become AVSC International. (The term surgical contraception refers to methods of sterilization like vasectomy for men and tubal ligation for women.) The association is based in New York and works in the United States and more than 40 other countries to provide training and other support to health care professionals in the fields of family planning and reproductive health.         Dr. Allan Rosenfield, dean of the Joseph L. Mailman School of Public Health of Columbia University, said, ''Dr. Edey became a psychiatrist after her four children were born and had a remarkable professional career, both as a psychiatrist and as an individual who was very much concerned about women's reproductive health and rights.''         Dr. Edey did much fund-raising on behalf of AVSC International. Working through the association and on her own, she also played a role in persuading a growing number of health care institutions in the United States to provide voluntary surgical contraception.         Dr. Edey was long active in, and on the boards of, the Scherman Foundation, which works in various fields; the Edey Foundation, set up by her husband, Maitland A. Edey, an editor at Time Inc. and an author, which supports conservation activities on Martha's Vineyard, and the Martha's Vineyard Community Foundation.         A native New Yorker, she graduated from Brearley School in Manhattan and in 1933 from Vassar. She received her medical degree in 1951 from New York University, graduated in 1962 from the William Alanson White Psychoanalytic Institute in Manhattan and practiced psychiatry and psychoanalysis from 1957 to 1970 in Manhattan.         Mr. Edey, the co-author of the book ''Lucy: The Beginnings of Mankind'' (1981), which won a National Book Award, died in 1992. Dr. Edey is survived by two sons, Maitland A. Jr. of Martha's Vineyard and Winthrop of Manhattan; two daughters, Beatrice Phear of Cambridge, Mass., and Marion Edey of Silver Spring, Md.; 13 grandchildren, and 4 great-grandchildren.       
         Tania Long, a war correspondent for The New York Herald Tribune and The New York Times who covered the London blitz and the Nuremburg trials, died Friday morning at her home in Ottawa. She was 85.         After suffering from a series of illnesses, Ms. Long committed suicide, said Dr. Guy Genier, a coroner in Ottawa.         ''She was a woman of strong character, strong principles, dedicated to her work,'' said Joan Gordon, a friend of Ms. Long's in Ottawa. ''Her life had become painful to her because of illness.''         Born in Berlin on April 29, 1913, Ms. Long was the daughter of Russian-born Tatiana Mouraviev and Robert Crozier Long, a British journalist. Educated in Germany, France and England, Ms. Long studied economics, Russian literature and European history. She became an American citizen in 1935 and began her journalistic career a year later as a reporter for The Newark Ledger. She returned to Berlin in 1938 to work for The New York Herald Tribune, and joined The Tribune's London bureau in 1941. She was one of only a few women who were correspondents in World War II.         In London, she wrote of the city's poor during the blitz and of the bombing of the Hotel Savoy. ''I was sitting in my third-floor room ready to get into bed when I heard the bombs coming,'' she wrote. ''Only a split second later, the next bomb hit the cornice of the hotel and went off, and almost immediately after that the other one hit the rear of the building. When one hears bombs coming that close, there is not time to do anything. One hasn't time to be afraid; that comes later.''         During the war, Ms. Long married Raymond Daniell, the London bureau chief for The New York Times, and joined The Times as a reporter in February 1942. When Allied troops invaded Europe, Ms. Long, who continued to write under her maiden name, followed their advance, writing stories from liberated towns in France. She followed the Allied troops in Berlin, apparently the first female correspondent to do so.         Ms. Long and Mr. Daniell became a prominent husband-wife journalistic team, covering the Nuremberg trials and postwar Germany. Ms. Long spoke the language of all four occupying powers -- English, French and Russian -- as well as German.         From 1952 until 1964, she and her husband ran The Times's bureau in Ottawa, where they became prominent figures in Canada's political and journalistic circles. Honored upon their departure with a gala attended by the Canadian Prime Minister, the couple were hailed in The Ottawa Journal. The couple returned to Ottawa upon Mr. Daniell's retirement from The Times in 1967.         Ms. Long's 1932 marriage to Merwin Mallory Gray in Paris ended in divorce six years later. A son from that marriage, Robert M. Gray, died of cancer, said Sarah Jennings, a Canadian arts journalist and a family friend. Mr. Daniell also died of cancer, in 1969. In the 1970's, Ms. Long became the first publicist for the National Arts Center of Canada.         ''She was one of the breed of women that came out of the wartime era,'' said Ms. Jennings, ''most of whom were happily married and supportive of their husbands but in and of themselves were very strong-willed and independent.''       
         Joan Hickson, a stage, screen and television actress who became an international celebrity when she played Miss Marple, Agatha Christie's sharp-witted elderly detective, in a BBC television series from 1984 to 1992, died over the weekend at a hospital in Colchester, Essex, said her son, Nicholas Butler. She was 92.         Though Miss Hickson acted in more than 80 movies and had a considerable stage career, it was as Miss Marple, a role she took on in her late 70's, that she achieved her most success and her greatest renown. On ''Mystery!,'' she played the part just as Christie had written it: as a seemingly fluffy and disorganized spinster whose vast understanding of human nature and formidable, cleareyed intelligence helped her solve the mysteries that visited her village with uncanny regularity.         Miss Hickson took to her late television career with relish, saying she thought that Miss Marple was a ''splendid'' person because there was ''nothing you could say or do that would shock her.'' Among her legions of fans, drawn from the more than 30 countries in which the series appeared, was Queen Elizabeth, who awarded Miss Hickson the Order of the British Empire in 1987.         Born in Kingsthorpe, Northampton, in 1906, Joan Hickson began acting as soon as she could despite disapproval from her relatives. ''My Aunt Aggie -- she was about four feet tall -- drew herself up to her full height and said, 'What is Joan's destination to be?,' which she thought was the gutter, you see,'' she once recalled in an interview. Her first appearance, in 1927, was in a provincial theater company as an aristocrat.         Later, she appeared often in West End comedies, often taking on the role of a slightly batty aunt or a befuddled middle-aged woman, characters with names like Mrs. Pottle, Gladys Rumbelow and Mrs. Mould. During World War II, when London was prone to sudden bombing, she appeared in the Open Air Theater in Regent's Park.         ''We kept one eye on the sky to see what was coming over,'' she recalled. ''We used to feel the audience were being damned stupid because they sort of hurled themselves on the ground.''         After a long stage career, which included appearances in Henry James's ''The Tragic Muse'' and Ian Hay's ''The Gusher,'' she began to appear more and more often in movies, including ''The Guinea Pig'' (1948), ''The Card'' (1952) and ''The  39 Steps'' (1959).         Speaking of the scores of films she made, she once said: ''I watch these old films in black and white, and suddenly the door opens and there I am. The other day I was wearing the most awful hat.''         She returned often to the stage. Later in her career, she appeared in three of Peter Nichols's plays: ''A Day in the Death of Joe Egg'' (1967), ''The Freeway'' and ''Forget-Me-Not Lane'' (1967). She also played Mrs. Bradman in the National Theater Company's production of Sir Noel Coward's ''Blithe Spirit'' (1976) and won a Tony Award as best supporting actress for her performance as Delia in Alan Ayckbourn's ''Bedroom Farce'' (1977).         Before she became television's definitive Miss Marple (''there were 30 others in the queue for auditions,'' she said), she appeared in the slender role of Miss Pryce in a 1946 West End production of Christie's ''Appointment With Death.'' Christie  happened to sit in the audience one night, and sent Miss Hickson a prophetic note afterward that read, ''I hope one day you will play my dear Miss Marple.''         ''Retirement is fatal,'' Miss Hickson once said, and she continued working long after the Miss Marple series ended, recording audio books of Christie mysteries. Her husband, Eric Butler, a family doctor, died in 1967. She is survived by a son and a daughter.       
         Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, the grande dame of sex education, died yesterday at the Kendal at Longwood nursing home in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 94 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last decade.         Indefatigable and fired by a zeal for sexual responsibility and realism, Dr. Calderone persuaded a recalcitrant American Medical Association to let doctors dispense birth control as a matter of course to their patients, and she set in motion the means of educating schoolchildren about human sexuality.         Dr. Calderone did more than any other individual to convince both the medical profession and the public that human sexuality goes far beyond the sex act. She heralded it as a multifaceted and vital part of a healthy life that should not be hidden under a shroud of secrecy or limited to erotic expression.         One of her favorite challenges to young audiences she addressed was to ask for a four-letter word ending in ''k'' that meant sexual intercourse. Over a chorus of titters, she would give her answer: ''talk.'' Then she would explain, ''We never talk to each other as nonsexual people.''         Dr. Calderone, the daughter of the photographer Edward Steichen, was a woman of many talents and diverse interests who did not find her true calling until midlife. Following graduation from Vassar College, where she majored in chemistry, she decided to go on the stage, but abandoned her acting career when she realized she could never be as good as Katherine Cornell.         At the age of 30, after a failed marriage to a fellow actor, W. Lon Martin, and the birth of two daughters, Nell and Linda, she decided to go to medical school.         She received an M.D. degree in 1939 from the University of Rochester and a master's degree in public health in 1942 from the Columbia University School of Public Health. While at Columbia she met Dr. Frank Calderone, then a district health officer on the Lower East Side who would soon become deputy commissioner of health for New York City and her second husband. The couple was married in 1941.         Dr. Calderone served for some years as a school physician in Great Neck, L.I. In 1953 she became medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, where she carried forward Margaret Sanger's mission for family planning.         In 1964 Dr. Calderone realized one of her crowning goals: she convinced the trustees of the American Medical Association that the nation's leading organization of physicians should disseminate information on reproduction and birth control and endorse the prescription of birth control measures to all patients who needed them. The trustees' proposal was adopted, helping to move birth control into the mainstream of American medicine.         Three years earlier, as a representative of family planning, she took part in the first American Conference on Church and Family run by the National Council of Churches. Attended by sociologists, religious leaders, educators and public health professionals, the conference highlighted the suffering of thousands of people because of ignorance about frigidity, impotence, homosexuality and contraception.         With five colleagues at the conference, Dr. Calderone set up an informal committee to study human sexuality. Out of that committee grew Dr. Calderone's signature achievement, the co-founding of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States in 1964. Dr. Calderone then resigned from Planned Parenthood to turn her attention from reproductive biology to education in human sexuality.         Better known by its acronym Siecus, the council was created to help teachers, therapists and other professionals establish human sexuality as an integral part of health and health education. Under her guidance, Siecus became the moving force for education about human sexuality in the schools as well as in the community. The organization publishes ''Guidelines for Sexuality Education: Kindergarten through 12th Grade'' and helps schools around the country set up comprehensive sex education programs.         As the president of Siecus, Dr. Calderone stood out in the 1960's as an innovator, one of a handful of educators, scientists and philosophers who were beginning to address the big topics of human existence like death and sexuality. She was an unstinting advocate for the acceptance of masturbation as a wholesome, normal and almost universal practice for people of all ages.         Dr. Calderone was far more than a female doctor championing a cause. Her theatrical training, coupled with her carriage, poise and authoritative voice, helped her to get her message across that children are born sexual beings and remain so until they die and that people of all ages need and deserve a proper sexual education.         Dr. Calderone believed sex education in the schools should start in kindergarten, and under her direction Siecus helped to set up sex education programs in thousands of schools throughout the country. After stepping down from the presidency, she joined New York University as an adjunct professor in its program on human sexuality. She was active professionally until age 80.         Almost from birth, Mary Steichen was a natural leader: optimistic, determined, resilient and forthright, who from early childhood knew how to speak her mind. At age 6, for example, she criticized the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, a family friend, for creating ''L'Oiseau d'Or'' with a horizontal head, a position that she said would make it impossible for the bird to sing. Brancusi's later bird sculptures had more uplifted heads.         Her imposing appearance combined with her strong personality helped her advance her causes and also to defend them against attacks by groups like the Christian Crusade, the John Birch Society and Moral Majority, who contended that her promotion of sex education in schools was encouraging a premature and unhealthy participation in sexual experience and usurping the role of parents in guiding their children's lives. Her reply was that if parents were doing their job properly there would be no need for school-based sex education.         A devout Quaker and a Republican, she was once labeled by the John Birch Society as an ''aging sexual libertine.'' She reminded her critics that modern children were in desperate need of sex education because they were sexually vulnerable: ''devoid of chaperones, supervision, rules and close family relations and subject to onslaughts of commercial sexual exploitation.''         But recognizing that a child's sexual attitudes are often shaped before school age, Dr. Calderone also focused on educating parents. Through Siecus she established Parent Learning Centers to teach adults about their own sexuality as well as their children's.         In 1981 she and Eric Johnson wrote a widely praised book, ''The Family Book About Sexuality,'' which was published in five languages. The following year, she and James W. Ramey were the co-authors of ''Talking With Your Child About Sex,'' published in four languages.         Dr. Calderone also contributed to many professional publications and served as editor of texts on abortion and family planning.         Though Dr. Calderone saw serendipity as a major architect of her success, she did not always lead a charmed life. She grew up as the daughter of a working artist. Her mother, Clara, was considered cold, and their relationship adversarial.         When her parents divorced, Mary, then 10, chose to live with her father. Not until nearly seven decades after the divorce was she able to bury the emotional hatchet that had estranged her from her mother.         Dr. Calderone's own experiences as a mother were also difficult. Her 8-year-old daughter, Nell, died of pneumonia, plunging her into a debilitating depression.         Her marriage to Dr. Calderone, who later became chief administrative officer of the World Health Organization, produced two more daughters, Dr. Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist, and Dr. Maria Calderone, a veterinarian in Galena, Ohio, born almost 20 years after her oldest daughter, Linda Hodes, a psychotherapist in Albuquerque, N.M.         The Calderones separated in 1979 but never divorced. Dr. Frank Calderone died in 1987.         In addition to her daughters, Mary Calderone is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 10, 1998, Tuesday  An obituary on Oct. 25 about Dr. Mary S. Calderone, who battled political and religious groups to take sex education to schools, misstated her political affiliation. She was a Democrat, not a Republican. The list of survivors also misidentified the public health degree held by a daughter, Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist. It is a master's, not a doctorate.       
         Georgianna Morris Crowther Kappes, a longtime teacher of history in private schools, died on Oct. 17 at Greenwich Hospital. She was 94 and lived in Greenwich, Conn.         Mrs. Kappes, known as Nancy, was born in Lutherville, Md., and graduated from National Cathedral School in Washington and Smith College. She returned to school to earn a master's degree at Columbia University Teachers College in 1953 and taught at preparatory schools until retiring from the Masters School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., in the late 1960's.         Her husband, Carl, died in 1962. She was a sister of the late Bosley Crowther, a film critic for The New York Times.         She is survived by a son, Carl H. Kappes 3d of Greenwich; two daughters, Ellen B. Kappes of Northeast Harbor, Me., and Karen C. Kappes of Holden, Mass., and four grandsons.       
         Lila Katzen, a sculptor whose abstract works have adorned spaces from Fordham University's campus at Lincoln Center to the United States Consulate in Hamburg, Germany, died Sept. 20 at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 72  and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Philip.         Ms. Katzen was born and raised in Brooklyn. Early in life, when she realized she wanted to be a painter, she began studying at the Art Students League in Manhattan and later graduated from Cooper Union. Ms. Katzen also studied with the abstract painter Hans Hofmann.         She began her career as a painter and as early as 1955 had a solo exhibition at the Baltimore Museum of Art. A decade later she began working with plastic, and in 1968 she created a multicolored plastic floor with ribbons of black and gold for the Architectural League of New York. In 1970, she made a series of light tunnels for the Sao Paulo Biennale in Brazil, and in 1988 she was the American representative to World Expo 88 in Brisbane, Australia, where she exhibited a 20-foot-high sculpture of Cor-Ten steel.         Ms. Katzen's work is in the permanent collection of museums across the country, including the National Gallery of Art, in Washington, the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford and the Milwaukee Art Center.         Throughout her life Ms. Katzen was a visiting professor at schools around the country, including Wichita State University, Lehman College in New York and Cranbrook Academy of Art in Bloomfield Hills, Mich.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Denize, and a son, Hal, all of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Alicia Parla, a sinuous Cuban-born beauty who had a brief but incandescent run as the international Queen of the Rumba, died of cancer on Tuesday at her home in Miami. She was 84 and was recalled as the teen-age sensation who became the toast of New York and Paris, captivated crowned heads of Europe and taught the rumba to the Prince of Wales, Josephine Baker and a generation of Depression-weary revelers.         O.K., it wasn't the rumba. As purists never tire of pointing out, the dance by that name that swept America and Europe in the 1930's and became an Arthur Murray staple was such a tame, watered-down version of the Afro-Cuban original that it was closer to a dance the Cubans call the son.         Never mind. The authentic street rumba of Havana, whose extravagant, explicit gestures seem more suggestive of mating than of a mating dance, is not something one would have actually wanted to do on a dance floor before the 1980's, or ever on stage.         Whatever its pedigree, in Miss Parla's hands, or rather hips, the dance the world came to know as the rumba was such an appealing sight that she and it became overnight sensations.         For Miss Parla, at least, it took some doing. A native of Havana, where her father was a prominent doctor, she attended a convent school in Key West, Fla., then moved to New York with her mother during a period of political instability in Cuba in the 1920's.         Fortunately, as she pointed out in a 1995 interview with John Dorschner of The Miami Herald, her father, a man so strict that he would never have countenanced dancing as a career, stayed behind in Havana.         Not that her mother was not strict, too. From the time she was 9, Miss Parla recalled, her mother warned her almost daily that if she did not remain a virgin she would never find a man to marry her.         It was advice that Miss Parla seems to have taken to heart, in part, perhaps, because her admitted teen-age ambition was to marry a millionaire.         Her father had other ideas, insisting that his daughter obtain a measure of self-sufficiency by learning to type, ''until a millionaire comes along, as he put it.''         A dutiful daughter, Miss Parla obliged, but since she was a little girl her real passion had been dancing, and when a man who ran a dance studio in her apartment building marveled at her skill, she began to get the notion that she might actually become a professional.         She got her chance in 1931 after she began working as a 17-year-old cigarette girl at a Greenwich Village nightclub, a job she was able to take over her mother's objections only after promising never to let her father know, agreeing to let her mother serve as on-the-job chaperone and threatening suicide, something Miss Parla did with alarming regularity throughout her life.         Then came the inevitable night that the club's Spanish dancer became ill. Miss Parla volunteered to take her place, and, well, she was such a hit and gained such confidence that when the celebrated Cuban band leader Don Azpiazu issued a call for a rumba dancer for a gig at the Paramount a few weeks later, Miss Parla tried out, along with 150 other hopefuls, and got the job.         During rehearsals she was paired with a man, but she found him so clumsy and the whole experience so embarrassing that she persuaded Mr. Azpiazu to let her dance alone, as she did from then on. ''The rumba is very sexual,'' she explained, ''and I didn't like doing it with a partner.''         The decision may well have been crucial in allowing the rumba's eventual acceptance by a puritanical world, since for all Miss Parla's sensuous gyrations, the sight of a woman dancing alone was simply not as sexually suggestive as a couple dancing together.         It was the Paramount engagement that helped make the Azpiazu recording of ''El Manisero'' (''The Peanut Vendor'') a national hit and the foundation of the rumba craze of the 1930's.         After touring the United States with the Azpiazu orchestra (a musician's wife serving as her chaperone), then dancing with another orchestra at the Tavern on the Green in Central Park, Miss Parla (and her mother) joined Mr. Azpiazu for a European tour in 1932.         It was during an engagement in Monte Carlo that Miss Parla caught the eye of two future kings of England, Edward, the Prince of Wales, and his brother Albert, the Duke of York, who later became King George VI. The next day Edward summoned Miss Parla to his villa to teach him the rumba, as she did (with her mother tagging along). ''He got it,'' she said. ''He was very good.''         When another of her Monte Carlo conquests, Maurice Chevalier, asked her to go to Nice with him for the night, Miss Parla declined, saying, as she recalled, ''Oh, Mr. Chevalier, I'm so sorry. I'm a virgin.''         For all her triumph in Monte Carlo, Miss Parla was hardly prepared for what happened when she opened in Paris that July. When she made her entrance walking down a grand staircase wearing a slave scarf and a costume decorated in red, white and blue, the colors of the Cuban flag, the crowd went wild, she recalled, and began shouting ''Vive La France.''         Miss Parla later learned that it was Bastille Day and that the crowd had taken it as a tribute to France when she appeared wearing the colors of the French flag. The next day,  she was hailed by critics as ''the Cuban Mariana,'' (the French Uncle Sam, she was told) and the name stuck. Within weeks, ''Mariana scarfs,'' copied from her costume, were on sale in chic French shops, Miss Parla had taught Josephine Baker to rumba and had made a side trip to Brussels, where King Leopold was so enchanted he gave her a box of chocolates so big she danced on it for him.         After a triumphant return to the United States aboard the Ile de France in 1933, Miss Parla spent a year dancing at Mon Paris nightclub, where she was hailed by Walter Winchell as ''that lovely Havana torso flipper.'' Finally bowing to her father's wishes, she returned to Havana at the end of 1934 and married a few months later. She was not yet 21, but her reign as the Queen of the Rumba was over.         After her first husband, the playboy son of a wealthy rancher, discovered he couldn't keep her down on the finca after she'd seen Paree, Miss Parla obtained a divorce and later married Guillermo Amuchastegui, a celebrated jai alai player who took her all over the world, and she hobnobbed with the likes of Orson Welles and Esther Williams (when she wasn't in Cuba hobnobbing with Ernest Hemingway).         When Fidel Castro seized power in 1959, Miss Parla, by then married to a Batista government official, fled to the United States and settled in Miami. To make ends meet the former Queen of the Rumba, her father's daughter to the end, spent 20 years working as a typist.         Miss Parla is survived by a daughter, Ileana Comas, and a sister, Zilia Navarete, both of Miami, and two grandsons.       
         Elizabeth Chapman Gilkeson, an educator associated with the Bank Street College of Education for more than four decades and the founding director of its School for Children, died on Oct. 7 at her home in lower Manhattan. She was 95.         As a senior faculty member of Bank Street College, Mrs. Gilkeson helped develop many of the programs that define the institution, now on West 112th Street in Morningside Heights.         She joined the staff in 1955 as head of the children's program division; though she retired in the 1970's, she  remained active in the college's affairs, including its seminars on professional development.         The predecessor to the School for Children had its modest start in 1919, three years after Bank Street College opened as the Bureau of Educational Experiments. Under Mrs. Gilkeson's guidance, what began as an interdisciplinary program with nine toddlers took shape as an innovative learning environment in which young children were encouraged to interact with teachers, parents, their urban surroundings and one another.         Mrs. Gilkeson was born in Bethel, Me. She graduated from Vassar College in 1924 and, 10 years later, became a founder of the progressive Poughkeepsie Day School on the Vassar campus. She also was a member of the Vassar child study faculty through 1949.         She earned a master's degree at Columbia Teachers College in 1942, studied child and adult development at the Carolyn Zachary Institute in the late 1940's and pursued doctoral studies at Columbia in the early 1950's.         After joining the full-time staff, she expanded the School for Children beyond the nursery years to include pupils through the eighth grade, developed programs for children and parents and founded the Polly Miller Child Center in Marble Hill.         She supervised psychiatric residents from Albert Einstein Medical School at the School for Children, developed the multidisciplinary 42d Street Early Childhood Center for children and parents, and directed a national Head Start project as well as Bank Street's participation in the Federal Office of Education's National Follow Through Programs.         Mrs. Gilkeson, whose husband and son predeceased her, is survived by five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Main, a novelist who also wrote a highly regarded biography of Eva Peron, died on Nov. 8 at her home in Ridgefield, Conn. She was 95.         Ms. Main was born to British parents in Buenos Aires, where her father was general manager of the Buenos Aires Western Railway.         She grew up in privileged Anglo-Argentine society, attending finishing school in England before returning to her home, where she married James Main, a British engineer, in 1927.         In 1941, the couple moved to the United States and Ms. Main began writing short stories for The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and other magazines. She published two novels in the late 1940's, and in 1950 Doubleday asked her to write a biography of Eva Peron, who with her husband, Juan, was at the peak of power in Argentina.         Fearing trouble from the Peronistas, Ms. Main researched the book clandestinely in Argentina and published it under the pseudonym Maria Flores. ''Evita: The Woman With the Whip'' appeared in 1952, shortly after Eva Peron's death.         After Juan Peron was thrown out of power, subsequent editions appeared under Ms. Main's real name.         The success of the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical ''Evita'' in the 1970's and the appearance of the movie version in 1996 revived interest in Ms. Main's book, and it was republished several times in the United States and Britain.         ''I felt compassion, not sympathy,'' Ms. Main said in a 1980 interview in The New York Times. ''Eva did evil things, but she wasn't really evil. She lived a life of fantasy. She was her own creation.''         As Maria Flores, Ms. Main wrote two other books based on events in Latin American dictatorships: the novel ''The Call From Calle Moreno,'' about a doctor called in to treat a victim of Juan Peron's police, and ''The Benefactor,'' a story inspired by the disappearance of the Columbia University professor Jesus de Galindez, who was widely assumed to have been kidnapped by agents of Rafael Trujillo, the Dominican dictator.         Ms. Main's eyesight began to fail slowly in the 1940's, but it was many years before she could accept that she was going blind.         She was totally blind by the early 1960's, but she continued to write, dictating her works on tape and editing by going back and forth from one tape to another. But she published only one more book, ''The Girl Who Was Never Queen,'' a historical novel, in 1962.         In 1973, she moved to Connecticut to live with her son, Jeremy. She joined the National Federation of the Blind, founding its Stamford-area chapter and serving as its president.         In addition to her son, she is survived by three grandchildren, two stepgrandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Jean Dalrymple, who abandoned a nascent acting career to become a successful publicist, then an even more successful manager of concert artists and finally a dynamic producer of musicals and plays for City Center and other stages, died on Sunday at her Manhattan home, across the street from City Center. She was 96.         Miss Dalrymple's stature in the New York theater world was enhanced by her uncanny ability to lure just the right actor for a particular role at a price that City Center, with its limited budget, could afford. Her skillful productions nourished and entertained audiences there from the 1940's through the 60's.         Among the center's offerings during her tenure as director of its theater and light-opera companies were plays by Shakespeare and Shaw, Sartre and Tennessee Williams, with actors like Jose Ferrer, Charles Boyer, Franchot Tone, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, Charlton Heston, Helen Hayes and Tallulah Bankhead. She also revived musicals by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Frank Loesser, Rodgers and Hart, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.         The productions were quite polished. Indeed, after an opening of one Rodgers and Hammerstein revival, Miss Dalrymple received a floral tribute from the composers with a note that said, ''We wish last night had been the Broadway opening.''         In her day, Miss Dalrymple was one of a handful of formidable female producers; the others included Cheryl Crawford and Irene Selznick. She was as tough as they were, a woman in perpetual motion, but she did not seem that way.         ''Jean always had a kind of solid serenity about her,'' said Robert Whitehead, the producer. ''She had a great determination to get things done, but she was always very feminine, very pretty. She was an extraordinary person.''         Franchot Tone, an actor whose work Miss Dalrymple always admired, thought of her as ''the tenderest little lady.'' But a writer from The Cleveland Plain Dealer described as her as ''as fragile as a Fragonard painting but hep and with a sense of timing like a Garand rifle.''         In addition to luring actors, she was also able to persuade producers to give the City Center sets and costumes when their plays and musicals ended their runs. Thus, her revival of ''My Fair Lady'' featured the original costumes.         Creating a 'Temple' For Performing Arts         City Center, for which Miss Dalrymple worked so long and hard, was established on West 55th Street in 1943 by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and City Council President Newbold Morris, who wanted it to be a ''temple for the performing arts,'' offering productions for a top price of $2.         Miss Dalrymple was there at the very beginning. Her success with their dream was such that when the center turned 50 in 1993 and called itself ''a glorious home for dance, music, opera and dozens of extraordinary musicals and plays,'' there were many who thought the phrase an understatement of what Miss Dalrymple had accomplished.         Initially serving as volunteer director of public relations and as a member of its board, Miss Dalrymple remained at the middle of City Center's publicity apparatus even after she started producing and directing. At the same time, she served as personal manager to performing artists like Leopold Stokowski, Mary Martin, Jose Iturbi, Andre Kostalanetz, Nathan Milstein and Lily Pons.         Jean Dalrymple was born on Sept. 2, 1902, in Morristown, N.J., to George and Elizabeth Collins Dalrymple. There was no shortage of money in her family; her grandfather, an officer in the Civil War, had founded a coal and lumber business that sustained the family very well.         When she was 9, she finished a short story, ''The Spinning Top,'' and sold it to a Newark newspaper for $1. Encouraged by this success, she wrote more stories for a Philadelphia paper, receiving $5 for each one. But even in those days, she thought of writing as secondary to her goal of becoming a stage director.         After completing her secondary education, Miss Dalrymple moved to New York, studied secretarial skills at a business school and got a stenographer's job on Wall Street when she was only 16. She even made a respectable sum in the market before the crash of 1929. The crash propelled her out of Wall Street and into vaudeville. She created an act with her beau Dan Jarrett and worked with James Cagney and Cary Grant on the Keith-Orpheum circuit.         During this period, she tried her hand at playwriting; ''Salt Water,'' written with Mr. Jarrett, was produced by John Golden. She was hired by Golden as an understudy, casting director, play doctor and press agent, and her skill in handling the press so impressed him that he encouraged her to work at it full time.         It also impressed Ward Morehouse, the drama critic for The New York Sun, so much so that in 1932 he proposed marriage. It was not a successful union, but in the five years they were together, they collaborated on a screenplay, ''It Happened in New York,'' which was made into a movie by Universal Pictures.         Miss Dalrymple was married in 1951 to Maj. Gen. Philip de Witt Ginder, who died in 1968. No immediate family members survive. The funeral will be held on Thursday at 1:30 P.M. at the West Point chapel.         Miss Dalrymple was one of the founding members of the American Theater Wing, the theater service organization. In 1939 she was its first publicity volunteer, and during World War II, she trained speakers who sold war bonds during the time of the Stage Door Canteen.         By 1940, Miss Dalrymple was working as an independent press agent, much sought after because of her contacts. Among the Broadway plays for which she handled the publicity were ''Mr. and Mrs. North'' (1941), ''One Touch of Venus'' (1943)  and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1944).         In 1945, she turned to producing. Her first effort, a collaboration with Marc Connelly, was ''Hope for the Best,'' a comedy by William McCleery, who had been Sunday editor of the newspaper PM. She did not leave the publicity business but pursued more producing ventures, among them ''Brighten the Corner'' (1945) and ''Burlesque'' (1946).         Meanwhile, she began to devote more of her energy to developing productions for the newly formed City Center, which was started in the old Mecca Temple that had been built years before by the Shriners. It had been taken over by the city for nonpayment of taxes and it stood idle, except for its occasional use as the site for Civil Service examinations.         Early productions included Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town,'' mostly because it required no scenery and was inexpensive to produce, and ''Porgy and Bess,'' which the center snared as it was completing a national tour.         Miss Dalrymple was especially proud of her production of ''Porgy.'' ''I had an overwhelming desire to restore it to its original form and present it exactly as as George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward had created it, as an opera for the Metropolitan,'' she once recalled.         One Misstep, Angering Sartre         In her 1975 memoir, ''From the Last Row,'' she recalled that Howard Taubman of The New York Times ''loved it'' but that Judith Crist of The New York Herald Tribune said she preferred the original Broadway version. ''I wrote her,'' Miss Dalrymple said, ''and told her she had a tin ear.'' She was pleased that this production of ''Porgy'' sold out and that ''Miss Crist never held my impulsive letter against me.''         In 1948, Miss Dalrymple thought she had scored a coup when she succeeded in getting Jean-Paul Sartre's permission to produce his play ''Les Mains Sales'' in an English adaptation by Daniel Taradash called ''Red Gloves.'' She followed this up by inducing Charles Boyer to make it his first Broadway role.         What began as a coup threatened to become a coup de grace; Sartre read Taradash's adaptation after he gave Miss Dalrymple the go-ahead and was filled with loathing for it. He loudly denounced it publicly as ''a vulgar, common melodrama with an anti-Communist bias.'' When the play opened, Brooks Atkinson echoed Sartre's denunciation and wrote in The New York Times that it was a production that ''looked and sounded bogus.'' It quickly closed.         But she scored many triumphs in the years that followed. Word of her organizational abilities spread and in 1951 the State Department asked her to arrange for what the United States would offer at the Berlin Arts Festival that year. In 1958 the State Department called on her again, this time to arrange for the performances sent by the United States to the Brussels World's Fair, including those by Harry Belafonte, William Warfield, Jose Iturbi and the Juilliard String Quartet.         In 1953, she persuaded Jose Ferrer to star in and direct four plays at the City Center during an eight-week season: ''Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ''The Shrike,'' ''Richard III'' and ''Charley's Aunt.'' To help City Center grapple with its tight budget, Mr. Ferrer and all the cast members in these productions worked for the Actors Equity minimum.         Mr. Ferrer called the center ''this happy beehive of the arts,'' and donated $1,000 to the cause. The season was a critical and box-office success. ''They have made the theater seem like a fresh, exciting, varied form of public art,'' Atkinson wrote in The Times.         In 1956 Miss Dalrymple persuaded Orson Welles to appear in ''King Lear'' (he performed in a wheelchair after breaking a leg in rehearsals) and Tallulah Bankhead to play Blanche Dubois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Both productions earned critical praise.         Among Miss Dalrymple's other warmly received revivals were ''The Beggar's Opera,'' ''Brigadoon'' (with Edward Villela as the villain), ''Pal Joey'' (with Bob Fosse in the title role), ''Guys and Dolls'' (with Walter Matthau as Nathan Detroit) and ''The Pajama Game.''         When her revivals turned a profit, Miss Dalrymple used the money to subsidize City Center's other companies, the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera, both of which moved to Lincoln Center in 1964. Her revivals were doomed in the late 1960's, however, when the city began to experience a series of fiscal crises.         Among Miss Dalrymple's other books were an autobiography, ''September Child'' (1963), ''Careers and Opportunities in the Theater'' (1969), ''Jean Dalrymple's Pinafore Farm Cookbook'' (1971) and ''The Folklore and Facts of Natural Nutrition'' (1973).         As a producer, Miss Dalrymple tended to play down her adroit handling of the press, which is critical in the success of even the most expertly produced play. ''I never went in for theme parties or the crazy events that publicists stage today,'' she said in 1993. ''I simply advertised the facts of the production. At City Center, that was always enough.''       
         Esther Rolle, a pioneering African-American actress who gained national recognition in the 1970's for her role as Florida Evans on two television shows, first ''Maude'' and then ''Good Times,'' died at a hospital here on Tuesday. She was 78 and lived in Los Angeles.         Larry Calhoun, her longtime publicist, said the cause of death had not been determined, but he added that Ms. Rolle had been suffering from diabetes and had been under dialysis. He said she had celebrated her 78th birthday a little more than a week ago, and that one of the last things she had done was to write a check to support a local black theater, something she had done most of her career.         Ms. Rolle met with many of her old friends and cast members of the two television shows just last week in a gathering here for a People magazine article.         Norman Lear, one of the executive producers of both of her shows, said the once-stocky actress appeared thin but vibrant, and that she had a role in a forthcoming movie, ''Down in the Delta,'' directed by the poet Maya Angelou and scheduled for release this month.         Ms. Rolle became famous for playing the role of a strong-willed maid on television, and in that role she also performed memorably in the play ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' in the television movie ''Summer of My German Soldier,'' for which she won an Emmy award in 1979, and in the movie ''Driving Miss Daisy.'' She also appeared in the film ''Rosewood.''         But she spoke firmly and often about about her desire to fight black stereotypes on television and even left the cast of ''Good Times'' for a while, saying at the time that she resented the image presented by the buffoonish character of her son in the show. In the show she played the matriarch of a struggling black family in Chicago.         Ms. Rolle was well known for her strong personality, both on and off screen, and her ear for the nuances of race relations. Mr. Lear, who was the executive producer of ''All in the Family,'' from which ''Maude'' and ''Good Times'' were later spun off, said one of his most vivid memories of Ms. Rolle was a musical number she performed with Beatrice Arthur, the actress who played Maude.         Mr. Lear said that every year there was a musical number on the show, and one season Ms. Rolle and Ms. Arthur performed ''Me and My Shadow.'' Ms. Arthur kept trying to stand in back and play the shadow in the scene, but Ms. Rolle kept slipping behind her, a striking metaphor for the subtleties of race relations that Mr. Lear described as ''an indelible memory of an indelible woman.''         Ms. Rolle was born in Pompano Beach, Fla., a retirement community that was once a bucolic farming town with the character of the deep South. She was the 10th of 18 children and her father was a farmer.         She had a theatrical bent and after high school followed her sister, Rosanna Carter, also an actress, to New York. She was one of the early members of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York and in the late 1950's performed with Shologa Oloba, an African-American dance troupe. In 1958 she and her sister appeared with the company in a revival of Asadata Dafora's ''Zunguru.''         In 1990 she became the first woman to receive the N.A.A.C.P. Chairman's Civil Rights Leadership Award for her work improving the image of blacks.         Ms. Rolle's marriage ended in divorce and she had no children, her publicist said. She is survived by two sisters and a brother.       
         Carol Henning Shaw, an early organizer of Mothers' Voices, a national group working for AIDS prevention and cure, died Thursday at her home on the West Side of Manhattan. She was 59.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Shaw was moved by the fate of her stepdaughter, who was found to have AIDS when she was 27, to join Mothers' Voices, which recruits mothers as educators on sexuality and the risks of unprotected sex.         Both Mrs. Shaw and the stepdaughter, Pamela Ann Shaw, became leaders in the movement for AIDS research and education, meeting with President Clinton in 1994 to urge him to increase spending for these purposes. Pamela Shaw died in 1995 at the age of 31. Mrs. Shaw remained active in lobbying, demonstrating and fund-raising efforts.         Mrs. Shaw was born in Westwood, N.J. She graduated from Skidmore College, and did public relations work in the securities field.         A food expert by avocation, she was a news assistant and recipe tester in the style department of The New York Times for the last 10 years.         Mrs. Shaw is survived by her husband, Donald H. Shaw; her mother, Martha Henning of Westwood; two other stepdaughters, Victoria Louise Shaw-Williamson and Donaly Shaw, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Jean Cockcroft of Westwood.       
         Gina Blau, an American dancer who was an early exponent of Indian classical dance in the United States, died on Oct. 23 at Forest View Nursing Home in Forest Hills, Queens. She was 92.         Ms. Blau was the first non-Indian to be given the title of Natyakala Bushanam (Jewel of the Dance) by the Indian Institute of Fine Arts in Madras.         Before turning to Indian dance in the 1930's, Ms. Blau was one of two women in the 1929 graduating class  of St. John's Law School in New York City. A student of the American modern dancers Pearl Primus, Jean Erdman and Eleanor King, she gave up her legal practice to study Indian dance with Phupesh Guha from 1937 to 1941.         From 1941 to 1945, she choreographed and performed with the company of La Meri, the celebrated American ethnic-dance specialist.         She performed in New York in the troupe of Ragani Devi from 1946 to 1948.         Ms. Blau studied the Bharatya Natyam style in Madras with Guru Chockalingam Pillai in 1954 and became an authority on the highly theatrical Kathakali style after studying with Guru Ravunni Nair in Malabar.         She toured the United States professionally afterward under the name of Shrimathi Gina, sometimes under the auspices of the novelist Pearl Buck.         Ms. Blau taught Indian classical dance for many years in New York and also at colleges throughout the country.         She also taught at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and the Eugene O'Neill National Theater for the Deaf.         Ms. Blau, who was married to the late Lazar Platt, is survived by two sisters, Jeannette Silverman of New York and Gladys Saltzman of Tampa, Fla.       
         Irene Hervey, who secured her place as one of Hollywood's most beautiful leading ladies after playing Jimmy Stewart's love interest in the 1939 western ''Destry Rides Again,'' died on Sunday at the hospital of the Motion Picture and Television Fund in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 89 and lived in Los Angeles.         With her wide-eyed, dimpled good looks, Miss Hervey, who was born in Venice, Calif., became a contract player at MGM in 1933, where she played featured roles in movies and short subjects until she became a freelance actress in the mid-1930's.         She then joined Universal Pictures from 1938 to 1943, where she appeared in ''Destry Rides Again'' with Stewart and Marlene Dietrich.         In her prime, Miss Hervey appeared with some of Hollywood's major names, including Bing Crosby in ''East Side of Heaven,'' Lionel Barrymore in ''The Stranger's Return,'' Alan Ladd in ''Chicago Deadline,'' Raymond Burr in ''A Cry in the Night,'' Burgess Meredith in ''San Francisco Docks'' and William Powell in ''Mr. Peabody and the Mermaid.''         Miss Hervey also had roles in the films ''The Count of Monte Cristo,'' ''Frisco Lil,'' ''Cactus Flower'' and ''Play Misty for Me.'' She starred in the Broadway production and national company of ''State of the Union'' in the late 1940's.         She moved into television, appearing in such popular series as ''Family Affair,'' ''Twilight Zone,'' ''Perry Mason,'' ''The Wide Country,''  ''Richard Diamond, Private Detective'' and ''Charlie's Angels.'' She starred as Aunt Meg in the hit series ''Honey West'' with Anne Francis and received an Emmy nomination for a guest appearance on ''My Three Sons.''         Miss Hervey's marriage to the actor Allan Jones ended in divorce in 1957. She is survived by a daughter, Gail Christensen of Los Angeles, and a son, Jack Jones of Indian Wells, Calif.       
         Viola Farber, a founding member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, a choreographer and the director of the dance program at Sarah Lawrence College, died on Dec. 24 at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 67 and lived in Bronxville.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, Jeff Slayton, her former husband and longtime dance partner, said.         A tall, long-bodied individualist with uncompromisingly cropped hair long before that was fashionable, Ms. Farber was an unself-conscious study in quiet unpredictability. She moved with a fierce passion and intensity and a gentle lyricism. She could speak with the softness of a shy, reflective child or, in the studio, with the toughness of a drill sergeant. An edge of lazily subversive wit lay beneath her plain-spokenness in conversation and in her dancing.         In the quintessentially Farberesque ''Legacy,'' which she choreographed in 1968 to a Chopin etude, Ms. Farber moved like a dreaming, elegant giraffe, dressed in a flowing shift but wearing a baseball catcher's mitt on one hand. Poetic and mysterious, the solo was not at all Dadaist despite the incongruity and potential humor of the mitt.         ''Her body often had the look of one part being in balance, and the rest extremely off,'' Mr. Cunningham wrote of her in David Vaughan's book ''Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,'' in a description of Ms. Farber in his 1960 ''Crises,'' created in part for her odd talents. ''Now and again it was like two persons, another just ahead or behind the first. This was coupled with an acute rhythmic sense.''         Born in Heidelberg, Germany, Ms. Farber came to the United States with her family at the age of 7 and became a naturalized citizen six years later. She met Mr. Cunningham and his collaborator John Cage in 1952 at Black Mountain College, where she was studying dance with Katherine Litz and music with Lou Harrison. Ms. Farber joined the Cunningham company in 1953, dancing there through 1965. She created roles in some of Mr. Cunningham's major early works, among them ''Crises,'' ''Rune'' and ''Nocturne.''         During her Cunningham years, she also performed with Litz, playing a vampire in her ''Dracula,'' and with Peter Saul and Paul Taylor. Her last performance was in a 1995 collaborative duet, ''Threestep (Shipwreck),'' which she created with the choreographer Ralph Lemon, a former student, for his company's season at the Joyce Theater.         Ms. Farber formed the Viola Farber Dance Company in 1968, creating most of her choreography for the troupe, which disbanded in 1985. Writing in the International Encyclopedia of Dance, Christopher Caines describes her earliest dances as having a febrile atmosphere and ''a dark, violent intensity that some interpreted as sadomasochistic, despite moments of tenderness.'' By the 1970's, Ms. Farber had mellowed considerably. ''My dances report what I see,'' she told Jack Anderson in a 1978 interview in The New York Times. ''They are my response to the way everything is mixed up together in this world -- people and microbes and elephants and cassowary birds.''         In her 1973 ''Poor Eddie,'' Ms. Farber incorporated the gestures of flight attendants as they demonstrate the use of safety equipment in planes. Her own nervousness about driving in the middle, passing lane on a three-lane highway inspired the creation of another dance, ''Route 6.'' Like Mr. Cunningham, Ms. Farber favored the juxtaposition of disparate kinds of activity in dance, where formal patterns and the combinations of steps often mattered more than the steps themselves.         Ms. Farber was especially popular in France, where she won a gold medal, with Mr. Slayton, in the Ninth International Dance Festival in Paris in 1971. From 1981 to 1983 she was the artistic director of the Centre National de Danse Contemporaine in Angers, establishing, at the same time, an institute for the training of dance teachers in Paris. Ms. Farber returned to the United States in 1988 to take the Sarah Lawrence post, but continued to teach and choreograph in France into the 1990's. She also taught at the London Contemporary Dance School from 1984 to 1987 and, from early in her career, at universities and dance festivals throughout the United States.         The French Government recently named Ms. Farber an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France.         She is survived by two sisters, Elisabeth Lanzl of Chicago and Irene Aikin of Parkdale, Ore.         Correction:  January 6, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the dancer and choreographer Viola Farber on Dec. 31 misstated the work and the year in which she last performed. It was in James Cunningham's ''From the Horse's Mouth'' at the Joyce SoHo last April, not in ''Threestep (Shipwreck)'' in 1995.       
         Janet Brewster Murrow, a radio broadcaster and relief worker during World War II in London, where her husband, Edward R. Murrow, was CBS's star war correspondent, died on Friday at the North Hill retirement community in Needham, Mass., where she lived. She was 88.         Mrs. Murrow was born in Middletown, Conn., and graduated in 1933 from Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Mass. As a student leader she met Mr. Murrow, who was president of the National Student Federation of America.         They married in 1934. Beginning in 1937, and through World War II, they lived in London, and Mr. Murrow  went on to direct CBS's World War II reporting team and to win fame for his reporting about the war.         Soon after the war began in September 1939, Mrs. Murrow made her first radio broadcast, for CBS, about family life in wartime, and she became an occasional broadcaster for CBS and the British Broadcasting Corporation.         Her relief work included arranging for British recipients to get medicine and other supplies from American donors and helping evacuate British children to the United States. She also served on a British-American crisis team that worked to enhance relations between British civilians and American military personnel stationed in Britain.         In 1946 she received the King's Medal from Britain, and the Murrows returned to the United States.         She became a Mount Holyoke trustee for 21 years and also served on the boards of National Public Radio and the Henry Street Settlement in  Greenwich Village. Mr. Murrow became a CBS vice president and television broadcaster and then the United States Information Agency's director from 1961 to 1964. He died in 1965.         Mrs. Murrow is survived by a son, Casey, of Putney, Vt.; and two grandsons.
