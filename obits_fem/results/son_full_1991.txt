         Eleanor Schley Todd, a former Republican National Committeewoman, died on Monday at her home in Oldwick, N.J. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Todd died of congestive heart failure after a long illness, her daughter, Christine Todd Whitman of Far Hills, N.J., said.         In 1956, Mrs. Todd was elected vice chairman of the Republican National Committee. From 1956 to 1966, she was a Republican National Committeewoman from New Jersey. From 1946 to 1952, she was president of the New Jersey Federation of Republican Women.         She attended every Republican national convention as a delegate, alternate or convention manager from 1940 to 1976, and was a member of the board of governors of the Women's National Republican Club.         She was also active in civic affairs. In 1983, Gov. Thomas H. Kean appointed her to the New Jersey Board of Higher Education, where she served until 1988. She was a member of the Regional Planning Association and of the Hunterdon County Parks Commission.         In 1957 she was appointed to the Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a post she held until 1967. During World War II, she was chairman of the New Jersey Red Cross Canteen.         Mrs. Todd was born in Monmouth Beach, N.J., and was educated at the Chapin School, the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., Barnard and Sarah Lawrence Colleges and at Columbia University, from which she graduated in 1967.         She was a past chairman of the board of the Far Hills Country Day School and of the Foxcroft School. She was also a member of the Council of Independent Schools.         Her daughter, Mrs. Whitman, was narrowly defeated by the Democratic incumbent from New Jersey, Bill Bradley, in her recent campaign for the United States Senate.         Mrs. Todd's husband, Webster Bray Todd, a former state Republican state chairman in New Jersey, died in 1989.         Besides Mrs. Whitman, Mrs. Todd is survived by another daughter, Kate Beach of Washington; a son, Webster B. Todd Jr. of Pray, Mont.; a brother, Reeve Schley Jr. of Whitehouse, N.J., and eight grandchildren.       
         Jean Camper Cahn, a lawyer who helped establish Federal financing of legal services to the poor and was a co-founder of the now-defunct Antioch School of Law in Washington, died on Wednesday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 55 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said her husband and law associate, Edgar S. Cahn.         Mrs. Cahn spent most of her career pursuing legal and social causes in Washington, where the Cahns lived for two decades until they moved to Florida in 1984.         In one of her latest cases, argued in a Federal District Court in Florida, a decision handed down a week before her death upheld her contention that money distributed under the Older Americans Act must be aimed at benefiting those in greatest need. A Family of Activists         Mrs. Cahn was born into a family of social activists. Her father, Dr. John E. T. Camper, a physician in Baltimore, was a founder of the first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in that city, where she was born and reared.Regular visitors to the home included Thurgood Marshall, who was to become the first black Justice of the United States Supreme Court, and the singer Paul Robeson, who was her godfather.         While at Swarthmore College she met Mr. Cahn, a fellow student whose ancestors had been rabbis and lawyers for seven generations. The couple married in 1957 when she graduated and he was in graduate study of English at Yale.         Mrs. Cahn converted to Judaism and, at her husband's urging, applied for and won a scholarship to Yale Law School. Their elder son, Jonathan, was born on the day of her first examinations at law school, and their younger son, Reuben, was born a year later, while they were living and studying at Cambridge in England on a Fulbright fellowship.         Returning to New Haven, Mrs. Cahn served as associate general counsel for the New Haven Redevelopment Agency and in the country's first neighborhood legal services program, the Dixwell offices of Community Progress Inc., financed by the Ford Foundation. Joined War on Poverty         In 1964, during their final year in New Haven, the Cahns jointly wrote an article for The Yale Law Journal proposing a national system of legal services to the poor as part of what was to become the Johnson Administration's War on Poverty.         They moved to Washington that year, he to enter private law practice and she to take a post in the Office of Economic Opportunity. Mrs. Cahn was the first director of the National Legal Services Program in the O.E.O. and later founded the Urban Law Institute at George Washington University.         Mrs. Cahn attracted national notice in 1967 and 1968 as a lawyer for Adam Clayton Powell, a popular Harlem Congressman who was battling in court to reverse his 1967 expulsion from the House of Representatives for misuse of public funds and other transgressions. (The Congressman sat out the 90th Congress and subsequently won a special election and joined the 91st Congress in 1969. His expulsion was later found illegal by the United States Supreme Court. Mr. Powell died in 1972.)         In 1971 the Cahns co-founded the Antioch School of Law, which placed emphasis on serving the poor and trained prospective lawyers in social activism. Eight years later, Antioch College in Ohio, with which the school was initially affiliated, dismissed the Cahns as co-deans. The law school eventually became autonomous and, largely because of severe financial problems, it closed in 1988.         Mrs. Cahn continued to teach and to practice law. In 1984 she was a distinguished visiting professor at Middlebury College in Vermont, and in 1986 she was a distinguished visiting scholar at the London School of Economics. From 1986 until her death she was counsel to the Miami law firm of Fernandez-Caubi, Fernandez, Cancio & Allen.         In addition to Mr. Cahn, she is survived by their sons, Jonathan, a member of the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson in Washington, and Reuben, a public defender in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; her mother, Florine Camper of Baltimore; two brothers, Nixon and John Camper, and three sisters, Elizabeth Jones, Mary Lou Redd and Ella Johns, all of Baltimore.       
         Elsie Frum, a survivor of the Johnstown flood of 1889, died in her sleep early Wednesday. She was 108 years old.         Mrs. Frum was 6 years old when she and her family fled to a hilltop and watched a wall of water roar through Johnstown on May 31, 1889, killing 2,209 people.         Mrs. Frum is survived by two daughters, a son, eight grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren and seven great-great-grandchildren.       
         Janet Woodbury Adams, an authority on decorative screens, died Sunday at Hazelfield, the family farm in Jefferson County, W. Va. She was 60 years old.         Mrs. Adams died of cancer, said her husband, Wiliam Howard Adams, a lawyer and historian.         She was the author of "Decorative Folding Screens: 400 Years in the Western World" (1982; Viking) and curator of "The Folding Image," an exhibition sponsored by Yale University Art Gallery that opened in 1984 at the National Gallery of Art.         She was born in Kansas City, Mo., and graduated from Smith College in 1951.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Sarah W. Adams, a historic preservation specialist of Ithaca, N.Y., and Mary Chatham, an artist of Manhattan, and a son, William S., a lawyer, also of Manhattan.       
         Ruth McAneny Loud, a former president of the Municipal Arts Society, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 89 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications after emergency surgery for an ulcer, her daughter, Margaret Faron, said.         Mrs. Loud, a native and lifelong resident of Manhattan, was active in civic affairs for several decades. She was a daughter of George McAneny, who was Manhattan Borough President from 1910 to 1913 and president of the New York City Board of Alderman from 1914 to 1916. She was a graduate of the Brearley School and of Bryn Mawr.         After teaching at Brearley from 1929 to 1946, Mrs. Loud became director of the development office of the Museum of the City of New York. In 1965 she was elected president of the Municipal Arts Society and remained a member of its board of directors until her death.         She was co-author with Agnes Wales of "New York! New York! A Knickerbocker Holiday for You and Your Children" (Duell, Sloan & Pearce, 1946).         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Summit, N.J., Mrs. Loud is survived by a son, Roger, of Lake Placid, N.Y.; a sister, Elisabeth Harrison of Rumson, N.J.; three brothers, Herbert McAneny of Princeton, N.J., Ernest McAneny of New York City and David McAneny of Newtown Square, Pa.; seven grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Allison Moore Coudert, a philanthropist who was active in civic causes, died on Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications of pneumonia, said her daughter, Allison P. Coudert of Tempe, Ariz.         Mrs. Coudert was a member of the A.S.P.C.A.'s Founder's Society and supported museums and social welfare organizations in New York. She was past secretary of the Child Adoption Service of the Children's Aid Society and had been treasurer of the Oyster Bay Visiting Nurse Association on Long Island for many years. She attended Vassar College and served on the board of the Women's City Club.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Alexis, of McLean, Va.; a sister, Nina Moore Galston of Huntington, L.I.; a granddaughter, and a great-grandson.       
         Henrietta Isaacson Bicks, a retired lawyer, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89 years old.         Mrs. Bicks died in her sleep, said her son David, of Manhattan.         Mrs. Bicks was a partner for more than 20 years in the Manhattan law firm of Campbell & Boland, where she specialized in hotel law. The firm no longer exists.         She was a native New Yorker and graduated from New York University Law School in 1924.         Her husband, Judge Alexander Bicks of Federal District Court in Manhattan, died in 1963.         Besides David, a senior partner in the New York law firm of LeBoeuf, Lamb, Leiby & MacRae, Mrs. Bicks is survived by another son, Robert, a senior partner in the New York law firm of Breed, Abbott & Morgan, and eight grandchildren.       
         Mary Goldburt Siegel, a lawyer who in the 1920's helped break down barriers against women in the legal profession, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 years old.         She died of lymphoma, a family spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Siegel, a 1917 graduate of New York University Law School, passed the bar examination at a time when there were only a handful of women in the profession. In 1921, after leaving the profession for two years to have a baby, she began to search for a position as a law clerk. At the time, a year as a clerk was a requirement for being admitted to the bar. In a 1982 article written for The Women's Rights Law Reporter, she recalled that while such positions were readily available for men, there were practically none for women.         After a long search, a law school classmate finally hired her at no salary. A few months later, she took another position that paid her $4 a week to do some law research, but in which she primarily ran errands. The salary was $1 a week more than what she had earned operating a sewing machine in a garment center sweatshop when she came from Russia in 1911. Men in similar law clerk positions were being paid $15 to $25 a week.         She finished her apprenticeship at another law firm that gave her broader experience but paid her nothing.         Her first courtroom experience produced other traumas. "When my case was called and I walked over to the appropriate table, a bailiff rushed over to direct me to where he said I belonged -- the spectator's bench," she wrote.         A short while later, the judge presiding over the case asked to speak to the lawyers.         "As I walked toward him, I was reproached by the judge, who virtually sneered when he repeated that he wanted to confer with the legal representatives, not an office stenographer," she added.         Mrs. Siegel said that throughout her legal career she had to fight against the sexist attitudes of colleagues and clients, who usually expected her to work for a lower fee than her male counterparts. She had to prove herself constantly, she said, until the situation improved in the 1960's and 70's as more and more women became lawyers. She was in private practice when she retired about 10 years ago.         Mrs. Siegel was an assistant corporation counsel for New York City during the administration of Mayor John F. Hylan in the 1920's.         Her husband, Jacob, died in 1987. She is survived by a son, Eugene, a certified public accountant in New Rochelle, N.Y.; a daughter, Dr. Irene Thompson, professor emeritus at the University of Florida at Gainesville, and four grandchildren.       
         With reminiscences and some of her favorite songs, friends of Mary Martin gathered at the Majestic Theater yesterday afternoon to celebrate her life.         Miss Martin, who died of cancer in November at the age of 76, was recalled as a high-spirited artist who personified some of her signature roles; the eternal child in "Peter Pan," the "cockeyed optimist" in "South Pacific," the ebullient and nurturing protector in "The Sound of Music."         "She was the greatest figure we're ever going to have in musical comedy," said Helen Hayes. She quickly amended the announcement to include Ethel Merman. "Mary would rap me over the knuckles in heaven when I got there," she said, if she did not cite Miss Merman.         Miss Hayes remembered a trip with Miss Martin 35 years ago to Paris, where they were to perform in "The Skin of Our Teeth." Miss Martin took along grand clothes, she recalled, and as they walked through the city one day, "suddenly overhead there was a swoosh of birds," one of whom "took perfect aim on Mary."         "I didn't know her too well," she said, and she feared Miss Martin would "have hysterics" at the marring of her outfit. But, Miss Hayes said, there was Miss Martin "looking at me with a sort of half-smile, and she said, 'For some people, they         sing.'         That was the beginning of our friendship." Gold Dust From the Air         Van Johnson told of the time Miss Martin decided to stage a benefit for a hospital where she had been recovering from a 1982 automobile accident. To his horror, he saw her putting on a harness to reprise a number from "Peter Pan." "I said, 'Mary, you're         not!' "         he recounted, "and she said, 'Oh, yes, I am, and I may not come back.' And she zoomed up to the roof and sprinkled gold dust all over our hair."         Recalling the same car accident and another sign of the artist's indomitable temperament, Florence Henderson cited a time when Miss Martin, still a patient, was given a walker, an object she had apparently never encountered. She took it on a promenade down the corridor. Other people smiled, and she smiled back, Ms. Henderson recalled, adding that "she was         carrying         the walker."         She described Miss Martin as "truly the purest soul that I have ever known," adding, "She was so generous; she always let people into her circle of light." As for artistry, Ms. Henderson recalled a tribute that Miss Merman had made, in her fashion. Asked by a reporter what she had thought of Miss Martin's performance at the opening of "South Pacific," Ms. Henderson said, Miss Merman snapped, "Oh, she's all right, if you like talent.' " New Lyrics to a Favorite Song         In one of several videotapes shown, Miss Martin and Miss Merman were seen singing a medley, alternating, performing together and gradually turning the duet into a mock competition.         Carol Channing performed a tribute to Miss Martin that put new words to "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," the song that propelled Miss Martin to Broadway success in 1938 in Cole Porter's "Leave It To Me." "She played a nurse/She played a nun/She played a boy who was a fairy," Ms. Channing sang. "She stopped the show when she had to crow/And our hearts belong to Mary."         Other participants included the performers John Raitt, Carol Lawrence and Kathleen Nolan and the choreographer Jerome Robbins. President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, sent remarks in a videotape. Miss Martin's son, the actor Larry Hagman, and daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, introduced the program.         The event concluded with a 1983 videotape of Miss Martin singing a song from "Peter Pan." The tape's final image, of the artist with her arms outstretched, remained on the screen as participants in the memorial returned to the stage to applaud it.       
         Edith Bry, an artist who was best known for her work in fused glass, died on Jan. 19 at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 92 years old.         Miss Bry's glass pieces were installed at the Central Synagogue and the Park Avenue Synagogue in Manhattan, and at the Second Reformed Church in Tarrytown, N.Y. In a 75-year career that began in a New York batik studio when she was 15 years old, Miss Bry also produced oil paintings, enamels, mosaics, lithographs, woodcuts and silkscreen prints.         Miss Bry was born and brought up in St. Louis. She studied at the Art Students' League and with Guy Pene du Bois, and in the 1950's she worked with the painter Abraham Rattner. Her oils and lithographs are in the collections of several museums and institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of the City of New York, the New-York Historical Society, the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston and Carnegie Hall. She also gave lectures and demonstrations to the public at Wave Hill, the National Academy of Design and the Donnell Public Library. In 1983, a retrospective exhibition of her work was presented at the Loeb Student Center at New York University.         In 1929 Miss Bry and her husband, Maurice Shevelson Benjamin, a founder of the brokerage firm Benjamin, Hill & Company, commissioned the noted architect Ely Jacques Kahn to design an Art Deco apartment for them in the Beresford building on Central Park West. The apartment, which became the subject of considerable attention in recent years when architectural magazines proclaimed it one of the city's most intact relics of the Art Deco period, includes woodcut panels Miss Bry executed with Kahn.         Mr. Benjamin died in 1984. Miss Bry is survived by her son, Dr. Bry Benjamin of Manhattan, two grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         Muriel Stuart, an English-born ballerina who danced with Anna Pavlova and was a leading teacher at the School of American Ballet, died yesterday morning at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 90 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Stuart had been in poor health for years, said her son, Peter Warwick.         She came to Pavlova's attention when, at age 8, she answered an advertisement for a class for eight girls to be taught by the Russian ballerina in London. At the audition, Pavlova was fascinated by the way the child moved with the music at a sudden change of rhythm. Miss Stuart's musicality and lyricism were the hallmarks of her style as a dancer with Pavlova, whose company she joined at age 13, and as a teacher at the School of American Ballet, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet. A Gifted Trainer         Miss Stuart danced with Pavlova until 1926, when she left to marry a violinist, Julian Brodetsky. In 1927 she moved with him to Los Angeles, where she opened a dance school. Except for a brief stint as a first ballerina and choreographer with the Chicago Lyric Opera, she spent the rest of her career teaching, and she become known as a gifted trainer of female dancers.         She was invited to teach at the School of American Ballet in 1935. Since she had recently studied modern dance with Harald Kreutzberg, Martha Graham and Agnes de Mille, she was asked to teach classes in an ill-defined style that was less stringent than ballet but not quite modern dance. "My dear, if I'd sat them on the floor, they'd have died," she once said of her early students.         Though regal in manner, Miss Stuart was known for her waspish but understated wit. "It's either innate or it ain't," a student recalled her saying about rhythm. She could be transfixed by gifted students' dancing, as she was when Allegra Kent, a favorite, entered the school.         Born in a London suburb, South Norwood, Miss Stuart also studied with Enrico Cecchetti. She wrote, with Lincoln Kirstein, "The Classic Ballet: Basic Technique and Terminology," a 1952 book that has become a standard text.         Miss Stuart's first marriage ended in divorce, as did her second marriage, to James Warwick, a playwright. She is survived by her son, who lives in Middletown, N.J.       
         Ruth Dietz, who headed the Woolen Corporation of America in the 1950's, died on Monday at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Mrs. Dietz, a native of Manhattan, took over direction of the Woolen Corporation in 1950 on the death of her first husband, Louis Surut, who founded the concern in 1920.         In 1952 she married Arthur O. Dietz, president of the CIT Financial Corporation, who died in 1967.         Mrs. Dietz is survived by a daughter, Elaine Fenton of Manhattan; a son, Lee E. Surut of Bethesda, Md.; two brothers, Monroe Rubinger of Beverly Hills, Calif., and Ralph Rubinger of Palm Beach, Fla.; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Cipe Pineles Burtin, who broke the sex barrier at the Art Directors Club of New York by becoming a member in 1943 and went on to become the first woman inducted into its Hall of Fame, died on Thursday at Good Samaritan Hospital in Suffern, N.Y. She was 82 years old and lived in Stony Point, N.Y.         Mrs. Burtin, who worked under the name Cipe Pineles (pronounced seep pin-ELL-iss), suffered from chronic kidney disease and died of a heart attack, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She was the former head of publication design at the Parsons School of Design and a former art director of British Vogue, Seventeen, Charm and Mademoiselle magazines.         In 1943, she became the first woman to join the Art Directors Club of New York and was inducted into the club's Hall of Fame in 1975 -- the only woman inducted until last year.         In 1967 she became design consultant to Lincoln Center and a member of the faculty at Parsons.         She was a member of the visiting committee for the Harvard University Graduate School of Design and a former board member of the American Institute of Graphic Arts. She was also a former Andrew Mellon Professor at Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art.         She was born in Vienna and came to the United States at the age of 13. She attended Bay Ridge High School in Brooklyn and won a Tiffany Foundation Scholarship to Pratt Institute. In 1932 she became assistant to M.F. Agha, the art director of Conde Nast.         Twice widowed, Mrs. Burtin is survived by a son, Thomas Pineles Golden of Stony Point, N.Y.; a daughter, Carol Burtin Fripp of Toronto, and two grandchildren.       
         Rhoda Bacmeister, an authority on early childhood education who directed nursery schools and wrote eight books about children, died on Wednesday at All Saints Catholic Nursing Home in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 97 years old and lived in Clemson, S.C.         She died of respiratory failure, her family said.         Mrs. Bacmeister taught at the Manhasset Bay School in Port Washington, L.I., in the 1930's. In World War II she set up day-care centers in Philadelphia for children of women working in war plants. After the war she was director of the Manhattanville Nursery School on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         She was a native of Northampton, Mass., and a graduate of Vassar College and the University of Chicago, where she earned a master's degree.         Mrs. Bacmeister wrote four books on early childhood education and four on literature for children.         She is survived by two daughters, Lucretia Harrison of Port Washington and Margaret Gruger of Anderson, S.C.; a son, Theodore, of Jacksonville; five grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Stockstrom McMillen Brown, a leading interior designer and founder of McMillen Inc. one of this country's best-known design concerns, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100 years old.         Considered a pioneer in her field, she built her reputation on her ability to combine great style with a keen sense of business. Mrs. Brown went to both business and secretarial school after having studied design for three years at the Parsons School in New York and Paris. "I thought if I was going to do it at all, I'd better do it professionally," she once said. "That's why it's McMillen Inc. and not Eleanor McMillen. I wasn't one of the 'ladies.' "         Instead of working from her living room, as so many decorators have done when starting out, she took $13,000 of her own money and opened an office in a town house on East 55th Street.  'Strong-Minded Vision'         "Mrs. Brown was a great Victorian lady with amazing taste yet she had a clear, strong-minded vision," said Mark Hampton, the New York interior designer who worked for her for five years. "She knew how to keep other talented decorators working under the McMillen name."         Over the years her clients included H. H. Rogers of Standard Oil, Arthur Houghton of Corning Glass, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Field, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford 2d, Ambassador and Mrs. Kenneth Franzheim and Mrs. Charles W. Englehard Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Dillon, Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Aldrich and Mr. and Mrs. William S. Paley.         In 1963 she was selected to decorate portions of Blair House, the Federal Government's Washington guest house for foreign dignitaries. In the Johnson Administration, McMillen Inc. also decorated the President's private quarters in the White House. In 1952, Mrs. Brown was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government.         Mrs. Brown was born Eleanor Stockstrom in St. Louis. Her father, Louis Stockstrom, founded the American Stove Company. At 24, she married Drury McMillen, an engineer. They traveled extensively for 10 years and were later divorced.         In 1934 she married the architect Archibald M. Brown.         Between marriages, while she was at the Parsons School, she became close to two people who taught there: the antiques expert William Odom, who first taught her to appreciate fine French furniture and was known as her silent partner, and the designer Grace Fakes whose flair for architectural detail was to account for much of Mrs. Brown's reputation.  Valued Parsons Training         So greatly did she value the school's training that she served on its board and for 40 years hired only Parsons graduates.         She also had a reputation as a genius at furniture arrangements. "Mrs. Brown had that uncanny ability to look at a room and instantly tell exactly how to place the furniture and objects so everything just worked," said Stanley Barrows, the former head of the department of interior design at The Fashion Institute of Technology.         She also had a talent for creating a look that was at once restrained and elegant. French furniture carefully mixed with modern pieces was one of her signatures. "Her earliest work could best be described as stripped-down Directoire," Mr. Barrows said.         "Later on she was one of the first decorators to take Italian 18th-century furniture seriously," he said. "It was a reaction to all the gloomy Italian Renaissance pieces that had been so popular."         One person who remembers her style particularly well is the decorator Sister Parish. When Mrs. Parish married at age 19 and had been decorating for all of a year, Mrs. Parish's mother gave the newlyweds a small house on Gracie Square. "It had been decorated from top to bottom by Mrs. Brown," Mrs. Parish recalls. "I never forgave my mother."         Nonetheless, Mrs. Parish said, she still has antiques Mrs. Brown bought for her.         Mrs. Brown went to her office every day until she was 85. "She came in regularly for five years after that," said Betty Sherrill, president of McMillen.         For about 60 years she lived in a duplex apartment on East 57th Street that barely changed since she first decorated it. She once said, "If you get it right the first time there's no need for change." And indeed, Mrs. Brown lived by her beliefs. Every 20 years or so pieces of furniture were reupholstered and the walls given a fresh coat of paint, but always in the same shade of pale yellow.         Mrs. Brown is survived by a son, Louis A. McMillen of Concord, Mass., three grandsons and two great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M on Feb. 11 at St. James Episcopal Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         LuEsther T.

At her death she was first vice chairwoman of the National Advisory Council of the American Civil Liberties Union.         Mrs. Pilpel, a frequent guest on the television program "Firing Line" with William F. Buckley Jr., was associated with the Manhattan law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges, which she joined in 1982. Throughout her career she lectured extensively on freedom of speech and the press, birth control, abortion and related subjects. She also spoke on the status of women and literary and entertainment law.  Served on Rights Panel         In the 1960's, she was a member of the Kennedy and Johnson Commissions on the Status of Women, serving on the committee on political and civil rights. From 1970 to 1978, she was chairwoman of the Law Panel International of Planned Parenthood Federation. She was also a consultant to the Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor from 1965 to 1976 and general counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union from 1979 to 1986.         She was also general counsel for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and special counsel for Planned Parenthood of New York City. In 1974, she was a founding member of the Women's Forum, an organization of women of achievement and influence from diverse fields.         In 1961, she argued successfully for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America against a suit asking the Supreme Court to rule on Connecticut laws that would have made it a crime to use birth-control devices or for doctors to advise their use. The Court declined 5 to 4 to rule on the laws.         In 1965, Mrs. Pilpel represented Dr. Benjamin Spock in a free-speech suit over whether advertising in his best-seller "Baby and Child Care," violated the public interest. The court ruled against Dr. Spock, who sought to block the ads.         She graduated from Vassar College in 1932 and received a master's degree from Columbia University Graduate School in 1933. She received a law degree from Columbia in 1936.         She is survived by her husband, Irvin B. Schwartz, executive administrator for psychiatry at New York Medical College; two children from a former marriage to Robert C. Pilpel, an executive at the Hudson Guild Settlement House, who died in 1987; a daughter, Judith E. Appelbaum, and a son, Robert H. Pilpel, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Juliette Brudney of Cambridge, Mass., and Ruth Frank of Sanibel, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Alice Cutts Wainwright, an environmentalist who wrote the charter for Friends of the Everglades and represented the Audubon Society in South Florida for almost 20 years, died after suffering a heart attack Tuesday at Mercy Hospital here. She was 83 years old.         Mrs. Wainwright worked closely with Florida's best known environmentalist, Marjory Stoneman Douglas, to found the Everglades protection group in 1969.         She helped to lead campaigns against a jetport in Big Cypress Swamp, home to the endangered Florida panther, and a resort city on the islands of what is now Biscayne National Park.         As the first woman elected to the Miami City Commission, Mrs. Wainwright successfully sponsored an anti-billboard ordinance.         She is survived by a son, John, of Washington, and two grandsons.       
         Emily McLaughlin, an actress who was a star in the television soap opera "General Hospital" for nearly three decades, died of cancer on Friday at her home here. She was 61 years old.         Miss McLaughlin, who portrayed Jessie Brewer, had appeared on the ABC series since its first broadcast, on April 1, 1963. She last appeared Feb. 13.         Miss McLaughlin was born in White Plains and earned a bachelor's degree at Middlebury College in Vermont. Her career included Broadway appearances in "The Frogs of Spring" and "The Lovers."         Survivors include a daughter, Mary Ann Anderson, and a son, Robert Lansing Jr.       
         Lisa Taylor, director of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design from 1969 to 1987, died on Friday in a hospital in Nassau, the Bahamas, said David McFadden, the museum's curator of decorative arts. She was 58 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.         Mr. McFadden said she died of liver cancer.         The museum's current director, Dianne Pilgrim, said through a spokesman that Mrs. Taylor "had a passionate belief in the importance of design and brought that passion and excitement to the museum."         The museum, in the former Andrew Carnegie mansion at 2 East 91st Street, is part of the Smithsonian Institution. It closed in 1963 but reopened in 1976, after Mrs. Taylor played a major role in raising funds to install it in the renovated mansion.         Grace Glueck, The New York Times critic, wrote in 1976, "The museum's far-reaching collection covers 3,000 years of artistic production, but it is also very much in touch with contemporary concerns, such as urban planning and the environment." 'Wallpaper to Bird Cages'         What is now the Cooper-Hewitt Museum originated as a part of Cooper Union, which had housed it since 1897. In the 1960's, financial problems led Cooper Union to end its ties with the museum, which by then was what Paul Goldberger, The Times critic, called "one of the world's finest storehouses of objects of design and the decorative arts -- with everything from collections of wallpaper to bird cages."         In 1969, the secretary of the Smithsonian, S. Dillon Ripley, named her as head of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum. In 1972 the Carnegie Corporation donated the mansion, and over the next four years Mrs. Taylor and her staff managed to obtain more than $6 million from private individuals, corporations and foundations.         It was Mrs. Taylor who had the idea for the annual Museum Mile open house and street fair involving museums along upper Fifth Avenue. It was first held in 1979, and 10 museums participated last year.         In 1976, Mrs. Taylor said, "I think we'll be a great success, because we have a superb collection and people are becoming more and more aware of how design relates to the quality of life. And besides, there's a feeling of love for us because we've made it." Edited Design Series         Mr. McFadden said Mrs. Taylor retired in 1987 for reasons of health and to work on the final volumes in a series of books she edited. The series, titled "Immovable Objects," comprises six books of essays by various authorities on the impact of design on daily life. The volumes have separate topics ranging from urban open spaces to the subways.         Mrs. Taylor was born on Jan. 8, 1933, in New York, the daughter of Theo von Bergen-Maier, an architect, and the former Martina Weincerl, a painter.         She studied at the Corcoran School of Art in Washington and at Georgetown and Johns Hopkins Universities.         She was on the staff of the President's Fine Arts Commission in Washington from 1958 to 1962 and membership director of the Corcoran Gallery of Art in Washington from 1962 to 1966. She then joined the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, where she helped to devise a highly successful Smithsonian educational program before being named to head the Cooper Union Museum.         She was awarded honorary doctorates by the Parsons School of Design and Cooper Union.         She is survived by her second husband, Bertrand L. Taylor 3d, who is an investor; their daughter, Lauren, and their son, Lindsay, all of Naples, Fla.

She was 48 years old and also had an estate in Rappahannock County, Va.         She died of lymphoma, her family said.         Ms. Golden did oil paintings, woodcuts, stained-glass works and, in recent years, large drawings in colored pencil. Her artwork was exhibited at the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the Vorpal Gallery in San Francisco and elsewhere around the country.         She was a skilled equestrian and did many drawings of horses, often in verdant Virginia landscapes. She was sometimes described as a representational artist of the West Coast figurative school.         A native of Washington, she earned a bachelor's degree and a master's degree in art at the University of California at Berkeley. As a graduate student, she studied with Elmer Bischoff and David Hockney.         She is survived by her husband, Barry Levine, a partner in the Washington law firm of Dickstein, Shapiro & Morin; a son, Adam Golden Levine, a student at the University of California at Santa Barbara; two daughters, Kiera S.

         Gladys Marcus, dean of liberal arts at the Fashion Institute of Technology, died on Sunday at New York University Medical Center. She was 79 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         Mrs. Marcus joined the faculty at the Fashion Institute of Technology as a part-time instructor in 1950. Before the year was out she had switched to full-time teaching. She left in 1952 to devote herself to her family. She returned to the institute in 1957 and, in 1977, was named dean of liberal arts.         She was instrumental in expanding and maintaining a broad-based liberal arts program at the school as part of its career-oriented degree programs. A proponent of global education, she initiated an overseas curriculum for the fashion institute. She was a member of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools visiting teams evaluating other colleges.         A native New Yorker, she was a graduate of New York University.

         Coral Lansbury, an author, Victorian scholar and dean of the Graduate School of English at Rutgers University's Camden campus, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 61 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Ms. Lansbury, who had written a number of scholarly literary works, began writing fiction late in her career when her cousin, the actress Angela Lansbury, said to her seven years ago, "Darling, are you going to go on all your life writing those dreary academic books that nobody reads?"         The result was "Sweet Alice," which E. P. Dutton brought out in 1986 and which Publishers Weekly praised as a "slightly naughty tale of greed, goodness and British breeding." Her second novel, "Ringarra," a Gothic tale, reached readers in 1985, even before "Sweet Alice" appeared. 'Mythic Quality' to Writing         In quick succession there followed "Felicity" (1987) a farce, and "The Grotto" (1989), whose writing was praised by John Mortimer in The New York Times Book Review for its "energy, good humor and mythic quality." Alfred A. Knopf will publish her fifth novel, "Opium!," next year.         Ms. Lansbury was born in Melbourne, Australia, in 1929 to British parents who were touring in a production of the musical "Showboat." The family was stranded by the Great Depression and Ms. Lansbury graduated from North Sydney Girls High School, a selective institution, and entered the University of Sydney at age 15.         A year later her father, who had become a sound-effects man in the country's fledgling radio industry, got her a part in a drama on the air. She worked for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation into the 1960's but as television supplanted radio drama she turned more to academic interests, publishing articles and lecturing widely.         Ms. Lansbury came to the United States and joined the Rutgers faculty at Camden in 1974. She wrote four books on Anthony Trollope and other Victorian literary figures between 1975 and 1984. She served as president of the Victorian Studies Association and of the Victorian executive committee of the Modern Language Association.         She is survived by a son, Malcolm Turnbull of Sydney, and two grandchildren.       
         Marie Jastrow, who wrote two critically praised books describing immigrant life in turn-of-the-century New York, died at her home in Tucson, Ariz., on March 30. She was 93 years old.         Mrs. Jastrow was 82 when her first book, "A Time to Remember: Growing Up in New York Before the Great War," was published in 1979 by W. W. Norton. It was followed in 1986 by a sequel, also published by Norton, "Looking Back: The American Dream Through Immigrant Eyes 1907-1918."         Reviewing "A Time to Remember" in The New York Times Book Review, Caroline Seebohm wrote: "This kind of document grows more and more precious with the years. Her vivid descriptions evoke more than just a lost age -- they evoke a certain feeling for America that cannot quite be duplicated."         Mrs. Jastrow was born in the Prussian city of Danzig, which is now Gdansk, Poland. She lived in Yugoslavia before moving to the United States with her family in 1907, at the age of 10. They settled in the Yorkville area of Manhattan.         In a 1979 interview Mrs. Jastrow recalled: "We enjoyed Yorkville when it was a melting pot for immigrants from all over Europe. It was a wonderful time. People were poor in money, but no one felt poor otherwise.         "We lived on East 81st Street. Fleischmann's Vienna Bakery was next door. It was managed by Raoul Fleischmann, who later became the publisher of The New Yorker. P.S. 96 was across the street."         Mrs. Jastrow said she had been writing since she was a young girl, but had always received rejection slips. "I concentrated on short stories, which I must say are very good," she said.         She is survived by her son, Robert, an astonomer, author and professor of earth sciences at Dartmouth College; a daughter, Dorothy Heller of Creston, N.C., and a sister, Yolanda Pesce, of Tucson.       
         Freda Resika Caspersen, an executive, philanthropist and former director of the Beneficial Corporation, died on Friday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey.

W. Caspersen Foundation, a major contributor to health and educational programs. She was a director of Beneficial from 1972 to 1984 and was also president of the Westby Corporation, a real-estate firm in Florida.         Her husband died in 1971.

Kemper, founder of the Kemper Group insurance companies and former Ambassador to Brazil, who died in 1981.         She is survived by a son from a previous marriage, Frank D. Stout of St. Helena, Calif.

In 1951, while she was with the Museum of Modern Art, Mrs. Bland wrote in The New York Times that it was important "for us art teachers to provide the opportunity for children to express their ideas and feelings with confidence that they will be accepted and respected."         Her work at the museum included holding classes for children and also providing instruction for other teachers.

In the 1960's, she was a member of the department of child psychiatry at St. Luke's Hospital.         She was the author of "Everyday Mother Talk to Toddlers: Early Intervention" (Academic Press, 1979), and co-editor with Richard K.

Miss Bruehl complained of severe stomach pains on Thursday and had emergency surgery but never regained consciousness, her agent said.         Born in Munich, Miss Bruehl began her movie career at the age of 12. She appeared in more than 20 films in West Germany, including "The Confessions of Felix Krull." She also became a popular recording star in her native country.         From 1970 to 1972, she starred in shows in Las Vegas, Nev., and later founded a film company with her husband, Brett Halsey.         After the couple divorced, Miss Bruehl began producing records. She returned to West Germany, where she acted in several television series.         She is survived by a son and a daughter.       
         Ruth Hornby Page, an educator and former executive director of the New Jersey School Boards Association, died on Sunday at Jupiter (Fla.) Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Tequesta, Fla.         She died of complications from heart surgery, said her grandson, Christopher Drew.         Mrs. Page, a 1932 graduate of Montclair State College, taught English at Park Ridge High School and Fairleigh Dickinson University before joining the staff of the School Boards Association in 1957. She led the 604-member organization until she retired in 1971.         Mrs. Page was a member of many educational organizations.         She is survived by her husband, H. Clifford Page; a son, Ronald, of Burke, Va.; a daughter, Lois Drew of Manhattan; a sister, Alice LeGrand of Fair Lawn, N.J., and five grandchildren.       
         Dame Peggy Ashcroft, an actress who was in the forefront of British theater for more than half a century, died yesterday in London. She was 83 years old.         She suffered a stroke on May 23 and was unconscious in the Royal Free Hospital since then, a spokeswoman for the hospital said.         Dame Peggy was in the Old Vic company in the early 1930's, frequently appearing with John Gielgud in the 1930's and 40's. She often performed in the West End of London in the 1950's and with the Royal Court, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1956 and in 1962 she became the first British actress to have a theater -- the Ashcroft, in her hometown, Croydon -- named after her in her lifetime.         When she was in her mid-70's Dame Peggy won her greatest international acclaim from roles involving two visits to India. She played a saintly, enigmatic Englishwoman in David Lean's film of E. M. Forster's novel "A Passage to India" and then was cast as a doubting former missionary in a television mini-series, "The Jewel in the Crown," based on Paul Scott's "Raj Quartet."         She won a 1984 Academy Award as best supporting actress for the film; the New York Film Critics Circle voted her best actress. The two performances brought her Britain's top film and television awards. She had previously won a string of awards as the finest actress on the British stage, and in April she won a special Laurence Olivier Award, London's major theatrical prize, for lifetime achievement in the theater. A Juliet to Remember         Dame Peggy was praised as a natural actress who projected an inner serenity and moral gravity. She illumined all of Shakespeare's young leading women and was hailed as the finest Juliet of her generation, artfully attuning her performances to Gielgud and Olivier versions of Romeo and Mercutio as the actors alternated in the roles throughout a season.         Detractors called some of her early performances too genteel and cool, too English bourgeois, but over the decades she displayed increasing versatility in plays by Shaw, Sheridan, Chekhov, Wilde and Ibsen. With uncommon ease she worked closely with new generations of theater people and in later years played Shakespearean matrons and roles created by Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, Harold Pinter and Beckett.         Her talents included portraying the rejected, the lonely and the oppressed with unsentimental sympathy. As Winnie in Beckett's "Happy Days," she was required to spend the first half of the performance buried up to her waist, the second half to her neck. It's "the greatest part ever written," she said, "nearer to Everywoman than any other I can think of, and like climbing Everest to perform."         In approaching hundreds of roles, including 10 leads in a season at the Old Vic, she tirelessly sought psychological truths. "Acting," she said in 1985, "is a mysterious business, so complicated, so tender a subject, there are no rules, and I think one works instinctively."  'Shimmering Radiance'         Defining her art in "Peggy Ashcroft," a 1988 biography, the critic Michael Billington cited her ear for language, her emotional identification with characters and avoidance of vulgarity and affectation.         Sir John Gielgud spoke of the actress's "shimmering radiance and a kind of forthright, trusting quality." The director Peter Hall said she maintained in old age an "extraordinary immediacy and passionate naivete." Harold Pinter said, "This flame of life she possesses informs all she does."         Dame Peggy appeared in only a few movies. Her most memorable early one was a vignette in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 thriller, "The 39 Steps," as a farmer's wife who bravely aids the hero (Robert Donat).         In making films she missed the theater's long, searching rehearsals. The problem with films, she said, "is that you have to imagine everything in sufficient detail before you begin."         "With the theater," she added, "there is time to try things out. With filming, it is hit or miss."         She said appearing in films was "instant acting" because a film actor might have to begin at the end of a scene or a movie and not be able to build a role. "Also, you're in the hands of a director and an editor who can cut and shape, and you have no idea how," she said. "And, of course, there's no sharing with an audience, no rapport."         Dame Peggy said she had no desire to retire. "Just a rest after the rather full years I had in India," she said in 1985. "Then I'll wait and see what television or film or the theater bring."         She cherished privacy and granted few interviews, once explaining gently, "I'm not interested in myself, very." But she was outspoken in protesting injustices and inhumaneness, at home or abroad. She criticized apartheid in South Africa and protested the sentencing of a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky, and political arrests in Czechoslovakia.         Edith Margaret Emily Ashcroft was born on Dec. 22, 1907, in Croydon, a London suburb, to William Worsley Ashcroft, an estate appraiser, and the former Violetta Maud Bernheim. Her father was killed in World War I when she was 10 and her mother died when she was 18, leaving her elder brother, Edward, as her only close relative.         She studied at the Woodford School in Croydon and after discovering "it was very exciting to become someone else," she said, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Her varied roles included Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello in 1930, stardom as Juliet and Shakespeare's other golden girls, as she called them, and title roles in Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," John Drinkwater's "Mary Stuart" and Arthur Schnitzler's "Fraulein Elsa."         A 1989 biography of Paul Robeson by Martin Bauml Duberman revealed that Dame Peggy and the actor had had an affair during the run of "Othello," and quoted her as saying, "How could one not fall in love in such a situation with such a man?"         Later roles included an alcoholic mother in "Edward, My Son," in both London and New York; an unloved spinster in "The Heiress," leading parts in Brecht's "Good Woman of Setzuan," Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and "Rosmersholm" and the 10-hour tour de force as Margaret of Anjou in the Royal Shakespeare Company's "Wars of the Roses."         Dame Peggy was married and divorced three times. She is survived by two children, Nicholas, a director, and Eliza, by her third husband, Jeremy Hutchinson, a lawyer. Her previous husbands were Rupert Hart-Davis, a publisher, and Theodore Komisarjevsky, a director.       
         Vera Yarrow, a teacher in the New York City public school system and a diction coach to singrs and actors, died yesterday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 88 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Yarrow, the mother of the singer Peter Yarrow of the group Peter, Paul and Mary, died of leukemia, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She taught English, speech and drama at various public schools, among them the Julia Richman High School in Manhattan, Walton High School in the Bronx, and Girls' Commercial High School in Brooklyn. She also lectured at Hunter College and coached singers and actors privately.         Mrs. Yarrow was born in Odessa, Russia, in 1903 and came to the United States three years later. She was a graduate of Hunter College and did postgraduate work at Columbia University.         In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Elena Mezzetti of Perugia, Italy; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Bessie Goldman, co-founder of Farmland Dairies Inc. in Wallington, N.J., died yesterday at her home in Fairlawn, N.J. She was 95 years old.         She came to this country from Russia with her husband, Max, in 1915. The couple founded Fairlawn Dairies Inc., which in 1970 was renamed Farmland Dairies of Wallington and is one of the largest privately owned dairies in the country.         Starting with 20 cows milked by hand, the business grew to employ 350 people and include a fleet of 300 trucks, processing more than a million gallons of milk a week and selling the milk and other dairy products and juices to supermarkets and small stores from Maine to Virginia.         In 1987, after a five-year legal challenge by Farmland, a ruling by a Federal District Court judge opened the New York City market to the company, upsetting a 50-year domination by a powerful group of distributors.         Mrs. Goldman retired in 1955. Her husband died in 1962.         Mrs. Goldman is survived by a son, Jacob, of Glen Rock, N.J.; two daughters, Ethel Weiner of Elmwood Park, N.J., and Margaret Stager of Paterson, N.J.; 16 grandchildren, and 19 great-grandchildren.       
         Katherine Byrne Mast, one of the first female sugar brokers in New York City, died on Wednesday in a nursing home in Devon, Pa. She was 84 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.         Mrs. Mast died of Parkinson's disease, said her nephew, John Ferguson of Greenwich, Conn.         During the early 1930's, she worked in the Manhattan office of W. H. Edgar and Son, sugar brokers of Detroit. She remained with the company until her marriage some 20 years later.         After her husband's death in 1964, she took over his business, Dutton, Mast & Company, a textile concern in Manhattan. The company was later sold.         From 1969 to 1986, when she retired, Mrs. Mast was president of Aug Millang, realtors in Manhasset, L.I.         She was a gradute of All Saints Academy in Harlem and of Trinity College in Washington.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Lee Remick, the elegant actress who illumined dozens of films and many stage and television plays, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 55 years old.         The actress died of cancer after fighting the disease for two years, a spokesman for the family said. In one of her last public appearances, a star was dedicated in her honor in April on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.         Ms. Remick, an uncommonly versatile performer, portrayed characters as disparate as a seductive cheerleader and a tormented alcoholic, along with such historical figures as Lady Randolph Churchill and Eleanor Roosevelt.         Once billed as "America's answer to Brigitte Bardot," she was as much admired for her acting abilities as for her bubbly attractiveness. Writing in The New York Times of her performance in the 1980 television movie "The Women's Room," John J. O'Connor said, "Lee Remick proves once again she is an uncommonly gifted actress whose somewhat fragile, almost stereotyped good looks tend to distract one from that fact."         Ms. Remick, who was born in Quincy, Mass., studied dance as a child and won her first acting job at age 16 with a summer-stock company on nearby Cape Cod. This led to a part in a short-lived Broadway comedy, "Be Your Age," in 1953, several more summer-theater appearances and a string of television roles on "Philco Playhouse," "Hallmark Hall of Fame," "Playhouse 90" and other programs in the mid-1950's. 'I Chucked School'         Later in her career, when asked about her decision to give up school in favor of acting, she said: "I'd cut classes to go to rehearsals, then stay up all night studying, but it wasn't working, and one day a very kind teacher advised me to choose one or the other. I guess the strain was showing. Anyway, it was an easily made decision. I chucked school, told my parents and then slept for 10 days."         After the director Elia Kazan cast Ms. Remick as a seductive cheerleader in his 1957 film, "A Face in the Crowd," she gave highly praised performances in Martin Ritt's "Long Hot Summer" (1958), Otto Preminger's "Anatomy of a Murder" (1959) and Mr. Kazan's "Wild River" (1960). Her portrait of a happily married housewife turned alcoholic in Blake Edwards's "Days of Wine and Roses" (1963) brought her an Academy Award nomination. Subsequent film roles included "Baby the Rain Must Fall" (1965), "Loot" (1972), "Sometimes a Great Notion" (1972) and "The Europeans" (1979).         She chose her roles with care. "After 'Anatomy,' in which I played a kind of tramp, for instance, I could have followed up with more of the same," she told an interviewer. "Reinforcing my 'image' by becoming a sex symbol would have been one way to be more strongly identified as a star, but I had no interest in doing that. I can't be something I'm not." On Broadway and Television         Ms. Remick's most successful Broadway performance was in Frederick Knott's 1966 thriller, "Wait Until Dark," about a blind woman at the mercy of three criminals. Her other stage credits included "Anyone Can Whistle," the 1964 musical by Arthur Laurents and Stephen Sondheim, and a Boston production of John Pielmeier's play "Agnes of God" in 1982.         Ms. Remick was a frequent star in television mini-series in the 1970's and 80's. She played the title role in "Jennie: Lady Randolph Churchill" (1975) and also starred in "Ike" (1979), "Haywire" (1980), "Toughlove" (1985) and "Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder" (1987).         Reviewing Ms. Remick's performance in "Nutcracker," a 1987 NBC mini-series in which she played a woman who manipulates her son into committing murder, Mr. O'Connor wrote in The New York Times: "If she had been born with Bette Davis eyes or Katharine Hepburn cheekbones, she might long ago have been recognized as one of this country's most outstanding dramatic actresses."  Of Preparation and Humility         Ms. Remick was known to prepare intensively for her roles, attending meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous for her work in "Days of Wine and Roses" and spending a month of blindfolded mornings at New York's Lighthouse for the Blind before starring in "Wait Until Dark."         "I'm really a housewife who is incidentally an actress," Ms. Remick told an interviewer. On another occasion she said: "People tell me that I have a special quality in films, but if I do I take no intellectual credit for it. It's pure instinct. I think I've held on to certain qualities within myself which have been strong."         Ms. Remick's marriage to William A. Colleran, a producer and director, ended in divorce in 1969. Her survivors include her husband of 21 years, Kip Gowans, a producer; a daughter, Kate Colleran Sullivan; a son, Matthew Remick Colleran; two stepdaughters, Justine Gowans Solly and Nicola Gowans, and her mother, Pat Packard.         Correction:  July 29, 1991, Monday         An obituary on July 3 about the actress Lee Remick omitted one of her survivors. He is her brother Bruce Waldo Remick of Springfield, Va.       
         Armina Marshall, an actress, a playwright and a co-administrator of the Theater Guild whose career on Broadway spanned more than half a century, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Philip Langner.         For nearly four decades beginning in the early 1920's, Miss Marshall, together with her husband, Lawrence Langner, and Theresa Helburn, co-founders of the Theater Guild, guided the subscription company through its glory years as one of the most successful producers of Broadway plays.         Miss Marshall and Mr. Langner, who had been married 37 years when he died in 1962, were the co-authors of seven plays, three of which made it to Broadway, including the 1933 hit "Pursuit of Happiness."         Miss Marshall, who was part American Indian, was born on the Cherokee Strip in what was then the Oklahoma Territory and spent her early school years in Pawnee, where her father was the sheriff. The family moved to the West Coast, and she attended the University of California at Los Angeles and taught school in Brawley, Calif., while playing small parts at local theaters.         She moved to New York to attend the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and in 1922 was introduced to Mr. Langner, a patent lawyer.         Miss Marshall was accepted into the Theater Guild and acted in several plays in succeeding years. In 1925 she and Mr. Langner were married. With Miss Helburn, a drama critic and director, the Langners built the Theater Guild into a Broadway powerhouse that by the time of Miss Helburn's death in 1959 had produced 190 attractions in New York City, in nine other cities across the country and in London.         The guild brought dozens of memorable productions to Broadway. Perhaps the most celebrated was "Oklahoma!" in 1943. The show, which blended narrative and song with ballet, transformed American musical theater almost overnight.         Among the outstanding playwrights whose work the guild produced were George Bernard Shaw, Eugene O'Neill, S. N. Behrman, Robert Sherwood and Maxwell Anderson. Actors who were guild regulars ranged from James O'Neill, Eugene's father, to Eva Le Gallienne, Claudette Colbert, Humphrey Bogart, Judith Anderson, Shirley Booth and Judy Holliday. Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontanne acted together in 19 guild-produced plays, Mr. Lunt alone in 4 others and Miss Fontanne alone in 2.         Miss Marshall was the associate director of "Theater Guild of the Air" for its eight-year run on radio and of "The U.S. Steel Hour" for eight years on television.         Miss Marshall's theatrical interests extended well beyond the guild. In World War II she was a founder of the Stage Door Canteen in Washington. She was also a founder of the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford, Conn., and a director of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Fund, with which she was active until five years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, Miss Marshall is survived by two granddaughters.         Correction:  July 23, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary headline yesterday about Armina Marshall, an actress and playwright, misstated her connection with the Theater Guild. She was a co-administrator, not a co- founder.       
         Bernice Jacobson, a retired consumer advocate who specialized in complaints about mail-order services, died on July 8 at Englewood Hospital in New Jersey. She was 75 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications after surgery, her family said.         Her first husband, Henry Zeeman, died in 1963 and her second husband, Morty Jacobson, died in 1969.         Surviving are a son, Roger Zeeman of Bridgewater, N.J.; a brother, Warren Hirsch of Weston, Conn., and a grandson.       
         Sylvia Scribner, a psychologist on the faculty of the Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Scribner died of cancer, a family spokeswoman said.         Dr. Scribner's research centered on cultural influences on learning and development. One of her best-known projects involved studying the literacy of the Vai people of western Liberia, who invented an original writing system. She detailed her research in a book, "The Psychology of Literacy," for which she received the Melville J. Herskovitz Award from the African Studies Association in 1982.         Before joining the faculty of the CUNY Graduate School in 1981, Dr. Scribner was a research scientist at the Center for Applied Linguistics in Washington and, from 1978 to 1979, was associate director of the National Institute of Education. From 1970 to 1978 she was senior research associate at Rockefeller University.         She graduated from Smith College in 1944 and earned a Ph.D. from the New School for Social Research in 1970. She began her career as research director for the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America in Newark.         Her husband, David Scribner, a lawyer, died in April.         She is survived by a son, Oliver, of Vancouver, B.C.; a daughter, Aggie Kapelman of Manhattan; three step-daughters, Toni Scribner of St. James, N.Y., Wendy Scribner of Manhattan and Nancy Jaslow of Abington, Pa., and two grandsons.       
         Elaine P. Halperin, a translator and editor, died on Sunday at her home in La Jolla, Calif. She was 81 years old.         She died of cancer, said her son, David.         Mrs. Halperin's first major work of translation was Francis Ambriere's "Long Holiday," a World War II prison camp memoir published in 1948. She translated several other works of fiction and nonfiction from French into English, including Michael Bernanos's 1968 novel, "The Other Side of the Mountain," which won her the Scott Moncrieff Award for distinguished translation. She also translated "Jean Monnet and the United States of Europe" (1969) and "The Duel: De Gaulle and Pompidou" (1972).         Mrs. Halperin's husband, S. William Halperin, died in 1979. In addition to her son David, a professor of literature at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she is survived by another son, John, Centennial Professor of English at Vanderbilt University.       
         Ruth F. Corcoran, who became the first woman to be elected to a Suffolk County town board when she won a seat as a councilwoman in Huntington, L.I., in 1961, died on Friday at the Hilaire Farms Nursing Home in Huntington. She was 81 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, a daughter said.         Mrs. Corcoran was a councilwoman from 1961 to 1965. She was also the founder of the Huntington Youth Bureau and served as chairwoman of the Suffolk County Youth Board.         Her husband, Charles R. Corcoran, an insurance executive, died in 1978.         She is survived by four daughters, Lucille Buergers of Hampton Bays, L.I., Mary Ehmann of Winnetka, Ill., Jean Schott of Alexandria, Va., and Ruth Ann Howley of Piscataway, N.J.; a son, Charles A., of Des Moines; 10 grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Adele Wood Timpson, one of the first blacks to become a school principal in New York City, died on Saturday at the Arden House convalescent home in Hamden, Conn. She was 87 years old and lived in Hamden.         Mrs. Timpson, a native New Yorker, held bachelor's and master's degrees from Hunter College. She taught and was a principal at Public School 100 in Upper Manhattan before her retirement in 1973.         She is survived by a son, Dr. Richard H. Timpson Jr. of Hamden; six grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Alline Elizabeth Davis, a past director of the Gramercy Park Neighborhood Association who was active in community affairs, died on June 18 at her son's home in Vista, Calif. She was 83 years old and until recently lived in the Gramercy Park section of Manhattan.         Mrs. Davis died of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, a spokeswoman for the family said.         In 1987 she founded and was director of a program, known as Help Our Neighbors Eat Year-Round, to collect cans of food at supermarkets in the Gramercy Park area for distribution to the needy elderly. In 1981 she founded the 22d Steet Association.         Her husband, Hermon Davis, a musician, died in 1965.         In addition to her son, Del, Mrs. Davis is survived by a daughter, Mona Shorey of Sutter Creek, Calif.; a brother, Edward Ponder of Chicago; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Irina Nijinska, a dancer and teacher who spent much of her life in a one-woman crusade to preserve the choreography of her mother, Bronislava Nijinska, died on Tuesday at the Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital in Inglewood, Calif. She was 77 years old and lived in Pacific Palisades, Calif.         She died of cardiac arrest, her husband, Gibbs S. Raetz, said.         Miss Nijinska's career was devoted to the championing of a single choreographer. She believed, as did most dance historians, that her mother -- who first achieved acclaim with Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in the 1920's -- was among this century's greatest choreographers. And she traveled the world reviving the elder Nijinska's works with selfless devotion.         In New York she staged productions for the Feld Ballet, the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem. She was also a familiar figure in companies as diverse as the Paris Opera Ballet, the Stuttgart Ballet, the National Ballet of Holland, Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, Tulsa Ballet Theater and the Dance Corps of the State University of New York at Purchase.         She most often revived two contrasting masterpieces by her mother: "Les Noces," a monumentally scaled depiction of a peasant wedding choreographed in 1923, and "Les Biches," a satire on the French Riviera "smart set" that received its premiere in 1924. In 1981, under Miss Nijinska's supervision, the Oakland Ballet became the first American company to perform "Les Noces." Four years later, the Feld Ballet danced it in New York and in 1989 it entered the repertories of the Joffrey Ballet and Dance Theater of Harlem.  Collaborative Efforts         That year, the Harlem company offered an all-Bronislava Nijinska program of "Les Noces," "Les Biches" and "Rondo Capriccioso," which Irina Nijinska revived in association with the ballerina Rosella Hightower. In 1989, Irina Nijinska and Frank W. D. Ries, a dance historian, reconstructed another satire, "Le Train Bleu," for the Oakland Ballet.         Wherever she went, Irina Nijinska amazed people with her inexhaustible vitality. She was a warmhearted, gregarious woman, and dancers who began by respecting her as a mentor came to cherish her as a friend. Although acquainted since childhood with famous choreographers and artists, she remained modest in manner. Typically, when a reporter asked if she wished to be addressed as Madame Nijinska, she laughed and replied, "Call me Irina. In our family, there is only         one         Madame Nijinska."         It was a distinguished family. Her uncle was the legendary dancer and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky, and her father, Alexander Kotchetovsky,was also a dancer.         Miss Nijinska was born in St. Petersburg on Oct. 20, 1913, but received most of her training, from her mother and other teachers, in Paris. She made her debut with the Olga Spessivtzeva Ballet in 1930 and, adopting Nijinska as her professional surname, danced during the 30's with the ballet ensemble of the Opera Russe a Paris, the Ida Rubinstein Ballet, the Theatre de la Danse, Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes and the Polish Ballet. Was Her Mother's Assistant         After an automobile accident in 1936 that reduced her performing abilities, she served as her mother's rehearsal assistant, and from 1941 to 1950 taught in the school her mother had founded in Hollywood. Miss Nijinska married Mr. Raetz, an aeronautical engineer, in 1946, and for much of the 1950's and 60's devoted herself to her family. When Nicholas Singaevsky, her mother's second husband, died in 1968, she once more became her mother's assistant, and after her mother's death in 1972 she embarked upon her travels as a choreographic reconstructor.         In recent years, Miss Nijinska had sifted through her mother's notes to determine precisely how many works by Bronislava Nijinska were revivable. With the aid of Nina Youshkevitch, a New York teacher who had danced in ballets by Bronislava Nijinska in the 30's, she staged an excerpt from "Le Baiser de la Fee" last fall for a symposium sponsored by the Dance Critics Association and the Dance Collection of the New York Public Library at Lincoln Center. At the time of her death, she was hoping to revive "Bolero," "Chopin Concerto" and "Impressions de Music Hall."         Miss Nijinska and Jean Rawlinson translated and edited "Early Memories," the first volume of Bronislava Nijinska's autobiography, which was published in 1981. Miss Nijinska was in the process of editing a sequel.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Natalie Raetz of Long Beach, Calif., and a son, George Raetz of Denver.

         Marguerite Feinstein, founder and director of the retiree division of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 23,000 municipal workers in New York City, died on Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. She was 57 years old and lived in Clinton Corners, N.Y.         Mrs. Feinstein, who was known as Maggie, was the wife of Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage, said Frank Mazza, a spokesman for the union.         Under the Local 237 retiree program, which Mrs. Feinstein founded in 1980, more than 5,000 members participate in classes, community projects and political activities as well as the customary social activities, trips and health-care seminars offered by labor unions. The program has become a model for teamster locals across the country and for locals of other unions.         Mrs. Feinstein was born in Milton, N.Y., and held bachelor's and master's degrees from Marist College. Before joining Local 237, she was director of legislation and political education for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in New York State.

         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died last night at her home in South Salem, N.Y., The Associated Press reported. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Dewhurst was pronounced dead by her personal physician, said Jan Stutts, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office. The cause of death was not immediately available.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten." She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses.         Her most recent New York appearances were on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in "Ah, Wilderness!," and as O'Neill's wife, Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1987. Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until last May.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant to use her distinctive, big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings." Born in Canada         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee Downer College, a girls' school, and decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side, shortly before he moved to Central Park. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice. Start of a Team         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming young performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two children, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Her first Broadway role with lines came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero. Starring With Jason Robards         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Ms. Dewhurst's other Broadway credits include the 1983 revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's comedy "You Can't Take It With You," in which she co-starred with Mr. Robards; O'Neill's "More Stately Mansions," with Ingrid Bergman in 1967; Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson McCullers's "Ballad of the Sad Cafe," in 1963, and a revival of Mr. Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," with Ben Gazzara and directed by Mr. Albee, for which she was nominated for a Tony in 1977.         She also appeared in many productions for Mr. Papp's Shakespeare Festival, including an "Antony and Cleopatra" in Central Park in 1963 without Mr. Scott (Michael Higgins played Antony) and stagings of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth." Her other Off Broadway plays include Athol Fugard's "Hello and Goodbye," in which she co-starred with Martin Sheen in 1969 and won a Drama Desk Award.         Her many films include Woody Allen's "Annie Hall"; "The Cowboys" and "McQ" with John Wayne; "Tribute" with Jack Lemmon; "The Nun's Story"; "A Fine Madness," and "Ice Castles."         She performed in the recent movie "Dying Young" with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!" Numerous TV Roles         On television she was seen with Candice Bergen on "Murphy Brown" in the last three seasons as Murphy's mother, Avery Brown, winning an Emmy Award in 1989. Her other television credits include productions of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," two Arthur Miller plays, "The Price" and "The Crucible," "No Exit," "The Women's Room," "As Is," "Anne of Green Gables," "Anne of Avonlea" and "Lantern Hill." She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about the most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to Campbell Scott, she is survived by another son, Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer, and two grandchildren.       
         Edythe Lutzker, a historian and author who went to college at age 46, died on Friday at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of complications from lung congestion, her son Michael said.         Mrs. Lutzker wrote a book on the first group of women to get M.D. degrees in England in the 19th century, "Women Gain a Place in Medicine," in 1969. She also wrote a biography of one of them, "Edith Pechey-Phipson, M.D.: The Story of England and India's Foremost Pioneering Woman Doctor."         More recently, Mrs. Lutzker, with Carol Jochnowitz, wrote a biography of Waldemar M. Haffkine, a bacteriologist who discovered vaccines against cholera and bubonic plague.         In 1950, when Mrs. Lutzker was 46, she enrolled in City College. "All my life I've had to postpone going to college," she said. "The problems that arise when a working woman brings up children forced me to put it off." She graduated in 1954 in the college's first arts and science class that included women.         She received her master's degree from Columbia University in 1959.         Mrs. Lutzker is survived by three sons, Michael, of New York City; Arthur, of Oakhurst, N.J., and Paul, of Washington; two brothers, David Levine of Margate, Fla., and Robert Levine of New York City; a sister, Miriam Gindin of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses, whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died Thursday night at her home in South Salem, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of cancer, said her son Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill.

         Carol H. Lefcourt, a prominent New York City lawyer and women's rights advocate who drafted much of New York's landmark child-support legislation, died yesterday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 47 years old.         She died of breast cancer, said Harriet N. Cohen, a lawyer and the co-chairwoman of the Coalition on Women's Legal Issues, which Ms. Lefcourt co-founded in 1986.         Ms. Lefcourt graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1968 and was a founding partner of the now-defunct New York Law Commune of Lefcourt, Garfinkle, Crain, Cohen, Sandler, Lefcourt, Kraft and Stolar. Taught at Brooklyn Law         In 1973, she was the founding partner of one of the first all-women law firms, Lefcourt, Kraft and Arber. She has also been an adjunct professor law at the Brooklyn Law School for the last decade.         Ms. Lefcourt served as the general counsel for the Governor's Office, the New York State Division for Women from 1984 to 1989. In that position, she authored legislation that raised the amount of financial support that children must receive after their parents divorce to the highest level in the nation.         She received the Susan B. Anthony Award from the National Organization for Women in February 1990. She was also the editor of "Women and the Law" (Clark-Boardman, 1984), which was cited by the Association of American Publishers as the best law book of that year.         Ms. Lefcourt is survived by her husband of 26 years, Robert, of New York City; a daughter, Jenny; a son, Daniel; her mother, Marjorie Hoffman of New York City, and a sister, Elaine Hoffman Rattet of New Rochelle, N.Y.       
         Joan D. Abrams, a former superintendent of schools in Red Bank, N.J., and a leader in the movement to open doors for women in school administration, died on Sunday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. She was 62 years old and lived in Short Hills, N.J.         Dr. Abrams died of breast cancer, her son, Linus, said.         As an educator, one of Dr. Abrams's concerns was advancing early detection of learning problems. In the Red Bank school system, where she was superintendent from 1974 to 1987, she began a systematic way for a teacher to determine how much a student had learned. She lectured nationally on this method, called mastery learning.         Before going to Red Bank, Dr. Abrams was superintendent of schools in Montvale, N.J. In New York City, where she began her career, she was principal of Public School 165, assistant principal of Public School 41 and a teacher at Public School 192.         Dr. Abrams received her Ph.D. in education administration from New York University in 1971. When she moved into administration, she was one of a few women in the nation in the top echelons of administration. To help change this, she founded the National Women's Caucus of the American Association of School Administrators.         Besides her son, Dr. Linus Abrams of Brookline, Mass., Dr. Abrams is survived by her husband, Nathan, and a daughter, Lydia, of New York City.       
         Ruth G. Schapiro, a nationally known tax lawyer and a partner in the New York firm of Proskauer Rose Goetz & Mendelsohn, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         Donald Schapiro, her husband of 39 years, said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Schapiro, a native of Manhattan, was a 1947 graduate of Wellesley College and received a law degree from Columbia Law School, where she was notes editor of the Law Review. She went to work in 1951 at the firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison and joined the Proskauer firm in 1955.         President Carter appointed Mrs. Schapiro to the Tax Court Nominating Commission in 1978, and she served as a member of the panel until 1981. At the time of her death, she was chairwoman of the committee on personal income taxes of the New York City State Bar Association.         She was a past chairwoman of the state bar's tax section, as well as of its finance committee, and served on the executive committee of the state bar's House of Delegates. From 1984 to 1989, she also headed a special committee on women in the courts set up by the state bar.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Schapiro's survivors include a daughter, Jane G., also of Manhattan; a son, Robert A., of Columbia, Md., and a sister, Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum of United States District Court in Manhattan.       
         Aline (Honi) Pollitzer Weiss, active for more than half a century with organizations concerned with the welfare of children, died on Sunday at her summer home in Stephentown, N.Y. She was 95 years old and lived in Medford, N.J.         She died in her sleep, her son-in-law, Judge Louis Pollak of Philadelphia, said.         For many years, Mrs. Weiss was chairwoman of the board of the Wiltwyck School for Boys. She was also on the board of the Northside Center for Child Development, Louise Wise Services and the Encampment for Citizenship, a youth leadership development group.         She came from a family with a tradition of social involvement. Her mother, Alice Kohn Pollitzer, one of nine women in Barnard College's first graduating class, founded the Encampment for Citizenship. Her sister, Margaret Pollitzer Hoben, helped found the Walden School.         When she was 70, Mrs. Weiss and her mother, on principle, challenged a Federal Government provision that required Medicare applicants to sign a loyalty oath.

         Nell Donnelly Reed, a pioneer in women's ready-to-wear clothing in the 1920's and 1930's, died Sunday morning at her home in Kansas City, Mo. She was 102 years old.         In 1916, Mrs. Reed began making and selling ruffled dresses to replace the drab, cotton house dresses of the period. By the 1940's her clothing company was described as the largest of its kind in the world.         Mrs. Reed said her frilly designs under the Nelly Don label helped challenge conventional thinking of pre-World War I America that it was impossible to give style to clothing in the cheap price range. Her first dresses sold for $1, considerably more than the average price of 69 cents. Savvy in Business         Mrs. Reed was described by Fortune Magazine in 1935 as possibly the most successful businesswoman in the United States. She was considered one who was ahead of her time, being among the first business leaders in her city to offer paid group hospitalization for employees and an unlimited number of tuition-paid night courses and scholarships for their children at local colleges, according to The Kansas City Star.         Through her business, the Donnelly Garment Company, a $3.5 million business with 1,000 employees in 1935, she helped turn Kansas City into a thriving ready-to-wear manufacturing center. Her first husband, Paul Donnelly, a representative for a Kansas City shoe company, acted as the head of the garment company in its early days, but she assumed full control when they were divorced in 1932.         In 1931 Mrs. Reed was the subject of national headlines when she and her chauffeur were kidnapped at gunpoint outside her home and held for ransom. The $75,000 ransom went unpaid and the two were released unharmed 32 hours later. Two men received life terms for their part in the abduction.         The prosecutor in the kidnapping case was James A. Reed, a former United States Senator and former Mayor of Kansas City, whom she would later marry. Mr. Reed, who served three terms in the United States Senate, from 1911 to 1929, died in 1944.  Company Name Changed         The 12th of 13 children, Mrs. Reed was born Ellen Quinlan on March 6, 1889, and grew up in Parsons, Kan., where her family had moved from County Cork, Ireland. At age 16, she married Mr. Donnelly and moved with him to Kansas City.         She said she began adding frills to house dresses so she could "make women look pretty when they are washing dishes," she once said.         The rapid growth of her company in the 1930's brought efforts by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to organize her plant, but despite legal maneuvers that reached the United States Supreme Court, her company was still union free in 1948.         Mrs. Reed retired from her company in 1956 and it changed its name to Nelly Don Inc. The company went public in 1958, but eventually filed for bankruptcy.         After her retirement, Mrs. Reed continued her involvement in business and civic affairs in Kansas City, serving on the school board and boards of numerous social and cultural institutions, including the Kansas City Art Institute and the Midwest Research Institute.         She is survived by a son, David, and four grandchildren.       
         Patricia Dickenson Cline, an associate director of development for Princeton University, died on Sunday at her home in Princeton Township, N.J. She was 56 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Born in New York, Mrs. Cline received an master's degree in arts education at Rutgers University and studied modern dance at the Martha Graham studio. She became the first executive director of Creative Theater Unlimited in 1974 and held the position until 1977. At Princeton, she worked on several of the university's recent development projects.         Mrs. Cline is survived by her husband, Hugh F.; a daughter, Lynn Hunter Cline of Princeton, and a son, Hugh D., of Los Angeles.       
         Princess Fahrelnissa Zeid, great-aunt of King Hussein of Jordan and an artist best known as an abstract painter of the Paris School in the 1950's and 60's, died on Thursday after a short illness. She was 89 years old.         During an artistic career that spanned more than 60 years, the princess blended elements of Islamic and Byzantine art with abstract and other influences from the West. She had exhibitions in major galleries in Paris, London and New York City.         The princess was born in 1901 in Istanbul to a prominent Ottoman family that included many artists. She began painting at the age of 14 and was one of the first women to attend the Academy of Fine Arts in Istanbul.         In 1934 she married King Hussein's great-uncle Prince Zeid el Hussein, a diplomat serving as a minister plenipotentiary in Turkey for his brother King Faisal I of Iraq. He died in 1970.         She is survived by a son, Prince Raad bin Zeid, and two children from a previous marriage: another son, Nejad Devrim of Warsaw, a painter, and a daughter, Sirin Devrim Trainer of New York City, an actress.

         Shirley Steinman Katzenbach, a philanthropist and volunteer in several health and cultural institutions in New York City, died on Monday at St. Luke's Roosevelt Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan and Waccabuc in Westchester County.         She died of a stroke, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Mrs. Katzenbach had been a trustee at St. Luke's and the New York Zoological Society, a board member of the Manhattan Mental Health Association and a member of the City Hospital Inspection Committee under Mayor John V.

         Hallie Burnett Zeisel, a novelist, college teacher and co-editor of Story magazine from 1942 to 1971, died on Wednesday at the Steward Health Center in Raleigh, N.C. She was 82 years old.         She died of causes related to a stroke she suffered two years ago, said her daughter, Whitney Voss.         The novelist, who was professionally known as Hallie Burnett, made her reputation as a nurturer of young talent at Story magazine.         She joined the periodical in 1942 as assistant editor and new wife of its editor and founder, Whitney Ewing Burnett. Through the 1940's and 1950's, Story published known and unknown writers alike, paying the same standard fees. Salinger, Cheever, Etc.         During her tenure, Mrs. Burnett helped publish the early short stories of writers like J. D. Salinger, John Cheever and William Saroyan.         Then there was the young soldier named Joseph Heller who entered a writing contest held by the magazine. And there were stories from Carson McCullers and Truman Capote. A Harvard freshman named Norman Mailer won a Story college-writing prize for a piece entitled "The Greatest Thing in the World."         In addition to publishing Story, the Burnetts edited anthologies of stories and fiction, along with "Story Jubilee: Thirty-Three Years of Story" (1965). The Burnetts also operated Story Press, a book-publishing concern. Story magazine closed down in 1971, and Whitney Burnett died two years later.         In 1977, Mrs. Burnett married William Zeisel, who died in 1980. Wrotes Novels and Textbooks         Mrs. Burnett's novels were "A Woman in Possession" (1951), "This Heart, This Hunter" (1953), "The Brain Pickers" (1957) and "The Watch on the Wall" (1965). She also wrote a number of textbooks, including "On Writing a Short Story," which was published in 1983.         Mrs. Burnett, whose family name was Southgate, had little formal schooling in her native St. Louis. She spent a good deal of time at colleges as the daughter and niece of trustees. She was married in the 1930's to Robert Abbott, a college teacher, but the marriage ended in divorce.         Later, she returned to campuses to teach literature and creative writing at schools like Sarah Lawrence, Wagner College, Hunter College and the University of Missouri.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, John Burnett, of Bali, Indonesia, and six grandchildren.       
         Gladys Gage Dibble, a Michigan horticulturist who wrote widely on gardening, died Friday at the Georgian Bloomfield Nursing Home in Bloomfield, Mich. She was 90 years old.         The William R. Hamilton funeral home in Birminham, Mich., where Mrs. Dibble lived, said she died of complications from a stroke.         Mrs. Dibble, who specialized in small garden plots for city dwellers, wrote about gardening for several publications, including The New York Times, The Christian Science Monitor, American Home and House & Garden.

         Nedda Casson Anders, a publisher and writer who edited the first Weight Watchers cookbook, died on Wednesday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 70 years old, her family said, and lived in Manhattan and Tamarac, Fla.         Her son, Richard, said she died of cancer.         Mrs. Anders, who was born in the Bronx and grew up in Brooklyn, first worked for M. Barrows publishing, where she wrote and edited books on cooking and crafts. In the mid-1950's she and her husband, George Anders, who died in 1987, began their own publishing company, Hearthside Press, which specialized in works on cooking, crafts and gardening.         Among the books she wrote were "Complete Cookbook for Infra-Red Broiler and Rotisserie," published by M. Barrows, and "Casserole Specialties" and "Chafing-Dish Specialties," both for Hearthside. Reviewers praised her recipes as clearly written and easy to follow.         But her biggest success was the editing of "The Weight Watchers Program Cookbook" by Jean Nidetch, which sold millions of copies.         In addition to her son, Richard, of Boston, she is survived by two sisters, Judy Halpern of Fresh Meadows, Queens, and Toby Halpern of Malverne, L.I.; a brother, Walter Casson of Rockville Centre, L.I.; and two grandchildren.

         Nadine Gordimer, whose novels of South Africa portray the conflicts and contradictions of a racist society, was named winner of the 1991 Nobel Prize in Literature today as her country finally begins to dismantle the system her works have poignantly explored for more than 40 years.         In a brief citation, the Swedish Academy, which confers the awards, referred to her as "Nadine Gordimer, who through her magnificent epic writing has -- in the words of Alfred Nobel -- been of very great benefit to humanity."         The academy also added that "her continual involvement on behalf of literature and free speech in a police state where censorship and persecution of books and people exist have made her 'the doyenne of South African letters.' " Effects of Apartheid         In her stories and in such novels as "A Guest of Honour," "Burger's Daughter" and "My Son's Story," Miss Gordimer has written of the effects of apartheid on the relationships of men and women, parents and children.         The academy had reportedly passed over the 67-year-old Miss Gordimer several times. "I had been a possible candidate for so long that I had given up hope," she said today in New York City, where she was on a lecture tour to promote her new collection, "Jump and Other Stories."         She is the first woman to win the literature prize in 25 years, and one of only seven to win it in its 90-year history.         This year's Nobel awards, the rest of which will be announced here and in Oslo later this month, carry a stipend of about $985,000 each, the largest amount ever. Nobel's will established a sizable fund -- from his earnings as a chemical engineer and inventor of, among other things, dynamite -- for the winners: "those who, during the preceding year, shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind."         Prof. Sture Allen, one of the 18 members of the academy elected for life and also its permanent secretary, said that he had tried to call Miss Gordimer in Johannesburg on Wednesday night to give her the good news, but nobody at her home knew how to reach her.         The Swedish Academy, in a brief critique of her works issued with its citation, said today: "Gordimer writes with intense immediacy about the extremely complicated personal and social relationships in her environment. At the same time as she feels a political involvement -- and takes action on that basis -- she does not permit this to encroach on her writings."         In South Africa, President F. W. de Klerk extended his congratulations to Miss Gordimer for what he called "this exceptional achievement which is also an honor to South Africa." He stopped short of endorsing her uncompromising writing.         "As South African head of state, I am always pleased when one of my countrymen does well and achieves international recognition," Mr. de Klerk said in a deliberately neutral statement. "The Nobel Prize for literature is unequaled in prestige in the world. Winning it is a noteworthy achievement from any point of view."         The award to Miss Gordimer led the television news broadcast of the state-run South African Broadcasting Corporation, which devoted 80 seconds to her achievement, informing viewers that the same honor had been bestowed upon Winston Churchill, Ernest Hemingway and Pearl S. Buck.         Archbishop Desmond M. Tutu, who was given the Nobel Peace Prize in 1985, said he was "over the moon" about the award to Miss Gordimer: "She's an outstanding artist, has a way with words but more than anything else she has had this tremendous commitment and caring about people, caring about justice."         Miss Gordimer was born in 1923 in a small mining town near Johannesburg.  Both her parents were immigrant Jews -- her father from Lithuania, her mother from England. As a young writer, she has said, she was strongly influenced by "The Jungle," Upton Sinclair's 1906 novel of social protest in America, which started her thinking about the plight of the miners in her own country.         Her first short story was published when she was only 15, and her first collection in 1949. Many stories appeared later in "The Soft Voice of the Serpent," a collection published in 1952; other notable groupings were "Friday's Footprints" in 1960, "Livingstone's Companions" in 1971, and "Something Out There," in 1984.  Ambiguity of a Title         The decisive part of her work, for the Swedish Academy, was her novels, particularly "July's People," published in 1981. The book describes a white family fleeing civil war with the help of their black servant, July, who takes them to his village. "The ambiguity of the novel's title quickly etches itself -- July's people are the white family he still serves but also the members of his tribe," the academy's literary critique said.         The announcement of the award to Miss Gordimer -- made at precisely 1 P.M., in keeping with tradition -- was met with cheers. Not since 1966, when Nelly Sachs shared the award with Shmuel Yosef Agnon of Israel, has a woman won the literature prize.         Professor Allen said the disagreements within the academy that had prevented the prize from going to Miss Gordimer before this would remain a secret for 50 years, like most other details of the prize committee's deliberations. But he volunteered that he had long been an admirer of her work.         He insisted that the award had nothing to do with the politics of apartheid, or with the fact that it was only this year that South Africa's leaders had finally begun to dismantle the system.         "The Nobel Peace Prize is a political award," Professor Allen said, "and it will be announced in Oslo. This is a literary award. That is her own argument; she is very keen on that point. Her works have a political basis, but her writing is different." Will Help Black Writers         Miss Gordimer, who is a member of the African National Congress, which had long been outlawed, said today that she wanted to use some of the prize money to help the predominantly black Congress of South African Writers.  "I'm a founder of the Congress of South African writers," she said at a news conference in New York, "and all my colleagues are black. Most of the black authors write in English, and I hope that they will begin to express themselves in their African languages."         The South African Government banned "A World of Strangers," published in 1958 and describing the difficulties experienced by a Briton establishing friendships with black South Africans in segregated Johannesburg. More than 20 years later, it banned "Burger's Daughter," a novel described by the academy today as one of her masterpieces, along with "The Conservationist" and "July's People."         "A Guest of Honor," published in 1970 and another novel cited by the academy today, described the conflict of loyalties experienced by a former colonial administrator returning to a newly independent African country that had expelled him for his ties to black groups.         "My Son's Story," published in 1990, describes "love in an insupportable society, the complications and obstacles inherent in the path to change," the academy said.         "The novel is ingenious and revealing, and at the same time enthralling because of its poetic values," the academy said. "Gordimer's specifically feminine experiences, her compassion and her outstanding literary style characterize her short stories as well."         All of her 10 novels and 9 short-story collections are now permitted to be published in South Africa.         Despite her fight against apartheid, Miss Gordimer, who has been married since 1954 to a Johannesburg gallery owner, Reinhold Cassirer, has always considered herself a South African. She said that she had only once considered emigrating, to Zambia. "Then I discovered the truth, which was that in Zambia I was regarded by black friends as a European, a stranger," she told Reuters in an interview this year.         The Nobel awards for peace, literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be presented in Oslo on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Alfred Nobel's death. He established the first five categories in his will; economics was added in 1968, with an endowment from the Bank of Sweden.       
         Roberta Strauss Feuerlicht, an author of 18 books of history and biography who frequently espoused liberal social and political causes, died yesterday of congestive heart failure, her husband said. She was 59 years old.         Mrs. Feuerlicht was born in 1931 in New York City. She earned a bachelor's degree from Hunter College in 1952, and after working as an editor of The Glen Oaks News and This Month magazine, began writing books. She published biographies of Oliver Wendell Holmes, Gandhi, Marie Curie, Theodore Roosevelt and Martin Luther King.         Among her most discussed works was her 1972 study, "McCarthy and McCarthyism," which argued that the late Wisconsin Senator was "an enemy of America's basic institutions" who "came closer to destroying America than any Communist, foreign or domestic."         Writing for The New York Times Book Review, Fred J. Cook described "McCarthy and McCarthyism" as "excellent, solidly researched."         Mrs. Feuerlicht's 1977 book on the trial and executions of Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti was praised in The New York Times by John Leonard as "the most comprehensive and persuasive account of the case we have," although he faulted the author for her tendency to "pontificate."         She is survived by her husband, Herbert Alan Feuerlicht of Manhattan, and a son, Ira, of Brooklyn.       
         Ethel Halsey Blum, a painter, water colorist and former journalist, died on Wednesday at her home in Lakeville, Conn. She was 90 years old.         She died of pneumonia, her family said.         Mrs. Blum studied at the Art Students League and the Brooklyn Academy and had her work shown in New York and New England. Among her subjects were the land, sea and animals of Long Island, Maine, Connecticut and the Bahamas, places where she and her husband lived and vacationed.

Recognizing the growing importance of homemakers and working women, Mrs. Rindlaub organized nearly 400 women at the agency into sounding boards for products and marketing. As forerunners of marketing-research focus groups, they offered ideas and reactions for products, brand names, packaging and advertising.         Mrs. Rindlaub, born in Lancaster, Pa., was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. As a teen-ager, she taught typing and shorthand at her father's business school and worked for Armstrong Cork as a secretary to the advertising manager.

She was a vice chairwoman of the National Safety Council, wrote a newsletter column for the National Council of Women, was a director of the Advertising Women of New York and the Fashion Group and was an adviser to the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.

She was citizen of the year in 1981. In Stamford she volunteered as a teacher's assistant.         Her husband, Willard, died in 1983.
