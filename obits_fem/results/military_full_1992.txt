         Anne Frankenthaler Kohn, a retired educator and travel agent, died on Thursday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 68 years old and lived in Manhattan. She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Kohn was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Calhoun School and Vassar College. During World War II she worked as a mathematician at Columbia University's Statistical Research Group, a secret project to aid the military.         Later she taught math at the Brearley School and for many years was a director and officer of the Calhoun School. She also worked more than 20 years as an agent for Frank Travel Service         She is survived by her husband, Henry, senior partner of the Frankenthaler Kohn Schneider & Katz law firm in Manhattan; three daughters, Margaret A. of Washington, Barbara K. Katz of Manhattan and Alice K. Domby of Atlanta, and six grandchildren.       
         Kathrine Robinson Everett, one of the nation's oldest and longest-practicing lawyers when she retired a year ago at the age of 97 after a 70-year career, died Tuesday at her home in Durham, N.C. She was 98 years old.         Her family said she died of heart failure.         Mrs. Everett was among the first female lawyers in North Carolina and earned several distinctions, scoring highest on her bar examination in 1920 and becoming the first woman to argue an appeal in her state's highest court, a case she won.         In 1954, she and her husband and son, both of them also lawyers, became the first family to be simultaneously sworn in to practice before the United States Supreme Court. That year, she was the senior delegate at the American Bar Association's convention in London.         A lawyer's association determined in 1990 that she was the oldest practicing lawyer in the nation at that time. Taught School for a Time         Mrs. Everett was born in Fayetteville, N.C., where her father was a lawyer. After graduating from the University of North Carolina, she taught school and worked at the Federal Research Information Bureau in Washington during World War I.         Then she returned to the university's law school, becoming its third female graduate. She worked in her father's firm, then married Reuben Oscar Everett and worked with him. Later she was a partner in the firm of Everett and Hancock. Her practice was mostly probate, real estate and family law.         She served 20 years on the Durham City Council after being elected in nonpartisan balloting. She was active in the real estate business and was a founder of WRDC-TV in Raleigh, N.C. She was also an elder in the First Presbyterian Church.         Surviving are her son, Robinson O. Everett of Durham, retired chief judge of the United States Court of Military Appeals, and three grandsons.       
         Kang Keqing, a veteran of the Communists' Long March and one of the best-known women in China, died today in the capital. She was 80 years old.         The official New China News Agency praised Ms. Kang as "an outstanding leader of the women's movement in China" and said she had died of an unspecified illness.         The report did not mention another important reason for Ms. Kang's fame: she was the widow of Zhu De, a famous revolutionary and military leader who died in 1976.         Ms. Kang's death is a reminder that many of China's most influential leaders are also in their 80's and 90's and in ill health. There have been few deaths in recent years, but many Chinese expect to see a substantial shuffle at the top levels of Government this year because of attrition. Aura of Prestige         Born in September 1911, Ms. Kang was the daughter of a poor fisherman in Jiangxi Province. Accounts vary slightly, but her parents apparently did not want a daughter. They reportedly gave her away when she was about one month old to grow up as a virtual slave in another peasant household.         At the age of 15 she joined the Communist Youth League, and a year later she ran away from her foster parents and a marriage they had arranged for her. She fled to Jinggangshan, a base for Communist guerrillas who were fighting the Nationalist forces led by Chiang Kai-shek.         She married Mr. Zhu, the commander of the Communist forces, whose full name is also spelled Chu De.         When the Nationalists attacked the base in 1934, she joined the Long March, the long and dangerous journey by foot across most of China to a new base in the northwest of the country. The trek took a year, and gave the marchers an aura of prestige that they carried for the rest of their lives. Central Committee Member         "It was just like going out for a stroll every day," she once said, playing down the hunger, sickness and battles that took the lives of many of the participants. Ms. Kang was a soldier, and she carried two pistols and a rifle on the Long March.         After the Communist revolution in 1949, Ms. Kang became a leader of the Women's Federation and entered the National People's Congress. From 1977 through 1985, she was a member of the Communist Party Central Committee.         Ms. Kang was not active in political power struggles, but she appeared periodically to greet children or to congratulate the Women's Federation on various achievements. The New China News Agency did not mention any funeral plans.       
         Pola Nirenska, a noted teacher and choreographer who danced with Mary Wigman, died on Saturday after a fall from the balcony of her apartment in Bethesda, Md. She was 81 years old.         The death was ruled a suicide by the Montgomery County Medical Examiner.         Miss Nirenska was a major force in dance in Washington, as a teacher, as director of a company whose dancers included Liz Lerman and Sharon Wyrrick (later choreographers in their own right), and as a creator of impressively fashioned dances filled with often raw emotion. Her last piece, presented at Dance Place in Washington in 1990, was inspired by Holocaust victims she had known and was called "In Memory of Those I Loved . . . Who Are No More."  Little Early Training         "Her dances are strong and stark, like massive three-dimensional sculpture in volume and weight," George Jackson, a Washington-based dance critic, said after Miss Nirenska's death. "Her figures are larger than life, but with very distinct personalities."         Miss Nirenska, who was born in Warsaw, insisted on a dance career as a child. She had very little early training, but graduated with honors from a music and dance school in Dresden, Germany, run by Wigman, the influential German Expressionist choreographer. Miss Nirenska performed with Wigman's company during its 1932-33 tour of the United States and Germany. She then embarked on a career as a solo dancer, teacher and choreographer, working in Warsaw, Vienna and Italy. In 1934 the International Dance Congress in Vienna awarded Miss Nirenska a first prize for choreography and a second prize for performing.         At the start of World War II, Miss Nirenska, who was Jewish, immigrated to England, where she gave solo recitals, choreographed musicals and entertained the troops. She also worked there with the choreographers Kurt Jooss and Sigurd Leeder and modeled for the sculptor Jacob Epstein.         Miss Nirenska left for the United States in 1949. She studied in New York with leading American modern-dance choreographers and teachers, among them Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman, Jose Limon and Louis Horst. She moved to Washington in 1951 and established a career there as a teacher at local ballet and modern-dance schools and at her own studio, and as a highly regarded choreographer with a company of her own.         Her marriage to Count John Ledesma, an actor and military pilot, ended in divorce. She is survived by her second husband, Jan Karski.       
         Millicent H. Fenwick, a retired Republican Congresswoman renowned for her political independence and championing of liberal causes, died yesterday at her home in Bernardsville, N.J. She was 82 years old.         She died of heart failure, her family said.         "Millicent Fenwick was the Katharine Hepburn of politics," said Charles Millard, a former aide and now a Republican New York City Councilman. "With her dignity and elegance, she could get away with saying things others couldn't."         Mrs. Fenwick, whose colorful personality inspired cartoon characters, had a varied career, including stints as a fashion model, an author and editor and decades of public service in local, state and Federal elected and appointed posts.         She was perhaps most widely known for her wit, zest and idiosyncrasies like pipe smoking, a habit she adopted when her physician discouraged her from cigarettes. Tall and patrician, but down-to-earth and pungent, she inspired the Lacey Davenport character in Garry Trudeau's "Doonesbury" cartoons. Watchdog of Helsinki Accords         On her substantive record, she won the respect of her political peers, sometimes grudgingly, for her advocacy on a wide variety of issues, including civil rights, peace in Vietnam, aid for asbestos victims, help for the poor, prison reform, strip-mining controls, reduction of military programs, urban renewal, campaign spending limits, gun control and restrictions on capital punishment.         Among Mrs. Fenwick's proudest achievements was being a lead sponsor of the resolution creating the commission to monitor the 1975 Helsinki accords on human rights.         Her views often placed her at odds with her party's leaders and seemed anomalous for the wealthy district in New Jersey's horse country that she represented. Fighting for bathrooms for migrant workers won her the nickname of Outhouse Millie. Others called her the Bella Abzug of Somerset County, a nod to the outspoken former Congresswoman.         She so frustrated Representative Wayne Hays, a Democrat of Ohio, that he once threatened to withhold her staff's paychecks "if that woman doesn't sit down and keep quiet." Hail and Farewell and Oink         Although Mrs. Fenwick was strong willed, she often charmed her ideological adversaries.         In a debate over equal rights for women, she once recalled, a male legislator said: "I just don't like this amendment. I've always thought of women as kissable, cuddly and smelling good." Her reply was classic Fenwick: "That's the way I feel about men, too. I only hope for your sake that you haven't been disappointed as often as I have."         When she left the State Assembly, one man kissed her, saying: "We male chauvinist pigs all will miss you, Millicent, because you're a wonderful woman."         Mrs. Fenwick's political career flourished with age. She first ran and won a seat in the State Legislature at the age of 59 and in Congress at 64. The Congressional primary rival she beat was Thomas H. Kean, later elected Governor.         Gov. William T. Cahill appointed her as New Jersey's first director of consumer affairs in 1972. Among her efforts were to protect car buyers from deceptive advertising and to require funeral homes to itemize bills in advance. Lost Narrowly to Lautenberg         Her Congressional tenure ended in 1982, when she ran for the United States Senate and lost narrowly to Frank R. Lautenberg, a Democratic millionaire whose big-spending campaign portrayed her as a doddering eccentric. She refused political-action committee money.         After her loss, President Ronald Reagan appointed her as the first American envoy to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome. She retired from that post in 1987.         After a heart problem in the 1970's, she had several operations for a pacemaker and a bypass of a leg artery.         Mrs. Fenwick was born in Manhattan to a prominent family with a tradition of public service and grew up in a 50-room mansion in Bernardsville. Her father, Ogden H. Hammond, was a financier and state legislator. When Mrs. Fenwick was 5, her mother, the former Mary Stevens, drowned when a German submarine sank the liner Lusitania. She was on a mission to Paris to create a hospital for war victims. Scandalized Her Family         Mrs. Fenwick attended the Foxcroft School in Virginia but left to accompany her father to Spain when he served as the American ambassador under President Calvin Coolidge.         Although she never received a high school diploma or college degree, she studied philosophy under Bertrand Russell at the New School for Social Research and studied at Columbia University. She was fluent in Italian, French and Spanish.         As a young woman, she scandalized her family by falling in love with a married businessman, Hugh Fenwick. They later married, but it lasted only several years. Mrs. Fenwick was left with two children and her husband's debts. Refusing money from her family, she scraped by on her own.         She inherited a fortune when her father died in 1956 but remained frugal, counting her change from coffee, using one lamp to work by and driving a Chevrolet that stood out in a community of luxury automobiles. She placed her assets in a blind trust to avoid political conflicts of interest.         She modeled briefly for Harper's Bazaar, then worked as a writer and editor at Vogue magazine and compiled "Vogue's Book of Etiquette" (Simon & Schuster, 1948), which sold a million copies.         Surviving are her son, Hugh Jr. of Bernardsville, 11 grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
