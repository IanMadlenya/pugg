         Anne Cox, a New York socialite who designed high fashion for high society in the 1950's and became the mother-in-law of a president's daughter, died on Tuesday in Westhampton Beach, N.Y. She was 86 and a resident of Palm Beach, Fla.         The cause was Lewy body disease, a form of dementia similar to Alzheimer's, her son Howard said.         Mrs. Cox offered her own designs in a boutique on 57th Street in Manhattan. She was also an occasional fashion and society columnist for The Herald Tribune and a fashion adviser for Bergdorf Goodman. Later she worked as a real estate developer in the Hamptons.         Mrs. Cox was descended on her mother's side from the socially prominent Livingston family. She was a patron of charities, including the Association for the Relief of Respectable, Aged, Indigent Females, of which she was president, and she was long the chairwoman or a co-chairwoman of the annual International Debutante Ball.         Anne Delafield Finch Cox was born in Westhampton Beach on March 13, 1918, and graduated from the Chapin School, where she was later a trustee and president of the alumnae association.         Her husband, Howard Ellis Cox, a New York lawyer, died in 1989. In addition to her son Howard Ellis Jr. of Boston, she is survived by a daughter, Mazie Livingston Delafield Cox of Northampton, Mass.; another son, Edward, who is married to Tricia Nixon, of Manhattan; a brother, Edward Ridley Finch Jr. of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.       
         Joanne Grant, an activist who documented the grassroots efforts behind the civil rights movement through her journalism, filmmaking and commentary, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Midtown Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, her son, Mark Rabinowitz, said.         Ms. Grant wrote ''Black Protest'' (Fawcett, 1968), a documentary analysis of black resistance from 1619 on. One of the first books to trace the origins of the civil rights movement, it remains required reading in many classes on African-American history.         A former assistant to W.E.B. DuBois, Ms. Grant sought to profile the struggle for civil rights through its community leaders. Her award-winning documentary film ''Fundi: The Story of Ella Baker'' (1981), about an unsung matriarch of the civil rights movement, was broadcast nationally on PBS. She later wrote ''Ella Baker: Freedom Bound'' (Wiley, 1998), a biography. In ''Confrontation on Campus'' (New American Library, 1969), she described sit-ins at Columbia University and elsewhere.         ''She was an important voice in the early writing on the civil rights movement,'' said Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, a professor of African-American studies at Harvard. ''Scholars began to realize that you couldn't understand how this became a national phenomenon unless you understood how communities rallied around issues.''         Friends described Ms. Grant as the movement's publicist and said she saw herself as both journalist and advocate. She was a member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee in the 1960's and in later years organized benefits for social causes and political candidates.         In the 1960's, as a reporter for The National Guardian, she often traveled to rural Southern towns to describe demonstrations and organizations that other publications largely ignored.         ''She exposed and explained the civil rights movement in ways that the daily press either couldn't or wouldn't,'' said Julian Bond, chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Joanne Grant Rabinowitz, whose father was white and mother biracial, was born in Utica, N.Y., on March 30, 1930. She graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in history and journalism.         In addition to her son, Mark, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, Victor, a lawyer and activist; a daughter, Abby, of Hamburg, N.J.; a stepson, Peter, of Clinton, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Joni, of Pittsburgh; a half-sister, Mary Jane Hubbard of Norwich, N.Y.; a half-brother, James Hubbard of Orlando, Fla.; and two step-grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Gould Packard, whose questions, comments and admonitions on the proofs of thousands of articles for The New Yorker for 54 years defined for many the care (some writers said obsessiveness) taken in editing the magazine, died Sunday in Manhattan. She was 87.         Her death was announced by her daughter, Susan Hathaway Packard.         Miss Gould, as she was known to the staff, challenged the logic, syntax, grammar, flow, usage, punctuation and vocabulary of a legion of nonfiction writers: E.B. White, Roger Angell, Wolcott Gibbs, Ved Mehta, Pauline Kael, Philip Hamburger, John McPhee, Lillian Ross. Many at The New Yorker believed the precisely penciled Gould proofs sustained its suavity of style.         David Remnick, the magazine's editor, once said: ''I think if there is an indispensable person here, it's Eleanor Gould. The relationship to her is as intimate as it gets; she has been inside my sentences.''         Invoking Harold Ross, the magazine's founding editor, Mr. Hamburger said, ''It is my impression that she brought to fruition an idea that Ross had, that everything should be looked at by a skeptical eye, not a cynical one, before it was presented to the public.''         Mr. Hamburger, who was interviewed several years before his death, sighed a little. ''Such probity and intelligence,'' he said.         Miss Gould's own view of her work was less glorified: ''I just try to make things right.''         Her work was not easily encompassed in a job title, and the magazine never saw a need to give her one. She was not a fact-checker, though she did find errors. She was not a story editor, copy editor or proofreader. She did not enter the process until an article had been examined by lawyers and editors and was in galley proof, close to the last minute. She worked her way down both margins, penciling corrections and suggestions in a legible hand, always providing her rationale.         ''A miracle to watch,'' said Edith Iglauer, an editor who once worked with her. ''The words danced across the page.''         As all editors know, showing such a thing to a tetchy or insecure writer might induce a tantrum. ''Not every writer gets to see a Gould proof,'' Mr. Angell said while she was still on the job. ''It's a challenge. You have to take a Gould proof seriously because she is a scrupulous reader, but you have to know what to ignore.'' If everything she recommended had been carried forward, he said, ''it would be like the purest water -- absolutely tasteless.''         Yet Mr. Remnick said on her death, ''If it's true The New Yorker is known for the clarity of its prose, then Miss Gould had as much to do with establishing that as its more famous editors and writers.''         He said that she had been greatly missed since a stroke took her off the job in 1999, but that there were still editors on the staff she had helped to train.         Miss Gould never used a computer and deadline pressure could sometimes render her handwritten work moot, especially during Tina Brown's chaotic six years as editor.         Eleanor Gould was born Oct. 3, 1917, in Newark, N.Y., to Wilson Mosher Gould, a lawyer, and Eleanor Loveland Gould. The family moved to Ohio and Eleanor graduated from high school in East Palestine, Ohio, in 1934. She won a scholarship to Oberlin and graduated summa cum laude with a major in English in 1938.         Aline Kilmer, a poet in New Jersey, became her mentor after years of correspondence Eleanor had initiated at 14. Kilmer taught her editing and helped her come to New York, and after several miserably paid editing jobs she applied to The New Yorker.         There was a myth that she flyspecked an entire issue and enclosed it with her application. But she described an application of less hubris: she noted two mistakes in recent issues, including, good Lord, a ''different than.''         She joined The New Yorker Nov. 5, 1945. Her marriage to Frederick A. Packard, also on the magazine's staff, came a year later, and the birth of their only child, Susan, a little more than a year after that. Her daughter and two grandsons survive.         In 1952, the family moved to Central Park West and 101st Street, where Miss Gould remained as long as she worked. She took a bus to the office on West 43rd Street, carrying a small lunch in an old shoe bag. For amusement, Miss Gould, who belonged at one time to Mensa, an organization of the supersmart, would factor the four-digit bus identification numbers.         In an interview in the summer of 1998, Miss Gould said she hoped to ''complete a century of Packards'' at The New Yorker. Her husband worked there for 45 years before he died in 1974. But for the stroke the year before, Miss Gould would have reached 55 years in 2000.         She was proud of her status. She cited the pinnacle she reached in 1972: a separate credit in ''The Elements of Style,'' the hugely popular text written by William Strunk Jr. and revived by E.B. White. The citation, which says, ''The co-author, E.B. White, is most grateful to Eleanor Gould Packard for her assistance in preparation of this second edition,'' recognized her as the linguistic equivalent of the Pope's confessor.         Interviewing Miss Gould for this obituary put the writer on the spot. Because she had been deaf since 1990, all questions had to be written; because of her status as a legendary editor, spelling counted. While asking about a Roger Angell statement, the interviewer at first wrote the name ''Angel,'' then added the second l. Miss Gould observed, ''I was going to say ''         Always the arbiter, she added, with amusement, ''I'll have to stage a faked death and come back to correct my obit.''       
         Andrea Dworkin, the feminist writer and antipornography campaigner whose work was a lightning rod for the debate on pornography and censorship that raged through the United States in the 1980's, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 58.         Ms. Dworkin died in her sleep, said her husband, John Stoltenberg. The cause of death had not been determined last night, but Mr. Stoltenberg said that Ms. Dworkin had suffered from several chronic illnesses in recent years.         With her unruly dark curls and denim overalls, Ms. Dworkin was for decades a visible presence on the lecture circuit, at antipornography rallies and ''take back the night'' marches. In speeches and in her many books, she returned vocally, passionately and seldom without controversy to the subjects of sex, sexuality and violence against women, themes that to her were inextricably and painfully linked.         Among her best-known books are ''Pornography: Men Possessing Women'' (Putnam/Perigee, 1981), ''Intercourse'' (Free Press, 1987) and ''Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant'' (Basic Books, 2002).         Reviewing ''Heartbreak'' in The New York Times Book Review, Laura Miller wrote: ''Dworkin is one of the few remaining specimens of pure countercultural Romanticism: fierce, melodramatic and utterly convinced that all truth can be found in her own roiling, untempered emotions.''         With her first book, ''Woman Hating'' (Dutton, 1974), Ms. Dworkin drew the lines in what she saw as a pitched battle against men's historical domination of women. She opposed all forms of pornography, which she believed incited violence against women. She was also critical of consensual sex between women and men, which she saw as an act of everyday subjugation in which women were accomplices.         ''One of the differences between marriage and prostitution is that in marriage you only have to make a deal with one man,'' Ms. Dworkin wrote in ''Letters From a War Zone'' (Dutton, 1989). Marriage, she added, ''is a legal license to rape.''         Andrea Rita Dworkin was born on Sept. 26, 1946, in Camden, N.J., and earned a bachelor's degree in literature from Bennington College in 1968. She later moved to Europe, where she married a Dutch political radical. The marriage was abusive, Ms. Dworkin said later, and she was divorced after three years.         ''I was a battered wife,'' she told The New York Times in 1985, ''and pornography entered into it. Both of us read it, and it helped give me the wrong idea of what a woman was supposed to be for a man.''         To Ms. Dworkin, it did not matter that some critics condemned her sweeping antipornography stance as a form of censorship. With the feminist lawyer Catharine A. MacKinnon, she wrote a municipal ordinance, briefly adopted by several cities in the 1980's, that defined pornography as a form of sex discrimination. (In 1986, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's ruling overturning the ordinance in Indianapolis.)         If Ms. Dworkin's work was unabashedly polemical, her life was full of nuanced contradictions. She publicly identified herself as a lesbian, speaking movingly about ''this love of women'' as ''the soil in which my life is rooted,'' and her work was a touchstone for many gay men and women. But in 1998, she married Mr. Stoltenberg, her companion of many years. A writer, editor and a founder of Men Against Pornography who also identifies himself as gay, Mr. Stoltenberg is her only immediate survivor.         Ms. Dworkin's other books include ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation'' (Free Press, 2000), ''Right-Wing Women'' (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1983) and, with Ms. MacKinnon, ''Pornography and Civil Rights: A New Day for Women's Equality'' (Organizing Against Pornography, 1988). Ms. Dworkin also wrote two novels, ''Mercy'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1991), about serial rape, and ''Ice and Fire'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1987), about prostitution.         Though some critics dismissed her work as unreasoned diatribe, Ms. Dworkin remained an outspoken champion of the causes in which she believed.         ''I am not afraid of confrontation or risk,'' she wrote in ''Letters From a War Zone,'' ''also not of arrogance or error.''       
         Evelyn Annenberg Jaffe Hall, a New York arts patron for 50 years and a supporter of medical institutions, died on April 22 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 93 and also had homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Newport, R.I.         Mrs. Hall, a sister of the late publisher Walter H. Annenberg, shared her fortune with many beneficiaries. Among her favorites were the Museum of Modern Art and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         Mrs. Hall was born in Milwaukee. Her parents were Moses and Sadie Annenberg. She graduated from the Calhoun School and studied at the Art Students League of New York. With her second husband, William Jaffe, she assembled an outstanding art collection that included European paintings, sculpture and antique furniture; Chinese porcelain; pre-Colombian artifacts; and Renaissance drawings.         A member of the Modern Museum's International Council since 1970, a trustee since 1979 and a leading member of various museum committees, she stood in the forefront of donors to its collections. Among the works she gave to the museum were pieces by Bonnard, Picasso, Miró and Vuillard. Another notable gift, made with Mr. Jaffe, was a selection of 16 prints by Edvard Munch.         Mrs. Hall was a benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum as well. She financed a scholarship in art history at Yale University and in 1960 endowed the Jaffe-Friede Art Gallery at Dartmouth College.         She was also a donor to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she endowed a lecture series at the medical school.         Mrs. Hall's first marriage, to Kenneth Friede, ended in divorce. In 1947 she married Mr. Jaffe, a corporate lawyer; he died in 1972. She later married Melville Hall of Palm Beach, who died in 1991. She is survived by three sons, John Friede of Rye, N.Y., Robert Friede of Newton, Mass., and Thomas Jaffe of Manhattan; a sister, Enid Haupt of Greenwich, Conn.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         Margaret Popkin, an American lawyer who worked to overhaul the judicial system in strife-torn El Salvador, died on May 18 at a hospital in Washington. She was 54.         The cause was complications of heart surgery, her family said.         After working in California as an immigration lawyer for Central American refugees, Ms. Popkin moved to El Salvador in 1985.         There she served as deputy director of the Human Rights Institute at the University of Central America, where six Jesuit priests and two others were assassinated in 1989. Ms. Popkin traveled the country investigating human rights abuses at a time of internal warfare and corruption.         Ms. Popkin continued her work after moving back to the United States in 1993. She served as a consultant to members of United Nations commissions on El Salvador and published a book on the subject, ''Peace Without Justice: Obstacles to Building the Rule of Law in El Salvador,'' in 2000. In 1999 she became director of the Due Process of Law Foundation in Washington.         Margaret L. Popkin was born on May 21, 1950, in Iowa City. She had an undergraduate degree from the University of California, San Diego, a master's degree in women's studies from Goddard College in Vermont and a law degree from the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley.         Ms. Popkin is survived by her mother, Juliet, of Los Angeles; her son, Joel, of Silver Spring, Md.; her brother, Jeremy, of Lexington, Ky.; her sister, Susan, of Vienna, Va.; three nephews, Gabriel Popkin, Alexander Popkin and Zachary Popkin-Hall; and a niece, Rachel Kang Popkin-Hall.       
         Anne Bancroft, the stage and film star whose signature triumphs in a 50-year career ranged from the courageous Annie Sullivan in ''The Miracle Worker'' to the hungrily seductive Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate,'' died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and Los Angeles. The cause was uterine cancer, said John Barlow, a spokesman for Ms. Bancroft's husband, Mel Brooks.         Graced with a sultry voice and expressive mouth, Ms. Bancroft could appear both tough and vulnerable, and she eagerly sought out nearly every kind of role, maturing effortlessly over the decades. She lent a singular potency to parts as varied as Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' and the mother superior of a convent, and from an aging ballerina to Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel. She repeatedly won praise for her work, as well as an Academy Award and two Tonys.         Arthur Penn, who directed her award-winning Broadway performances in ''Two for the Seesaw'' and ''The Miracle Worker,'' both by William Gibson, put it this way: ''More happens in her face in 10 seconds than happens in most women's faces in 10 years.'' Broadway lights were scheduled to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Ms. Bancroft worked hard to get beneath the surface, to inhabit a role as deeply as possible. While rehearsing for her role as the young Helen Keller's teacher in ''The Miracle Worker,'' she put tape over her eyes better to understand what it was like to be blind, learned sign language and spent time at a home for the visually impaired. Preparing for ''Golda,'' she traveled to Israel and got to know and observe Meir. She was more interested in performance than theory, although she was a member of the Actors Studio early in her career. The actor Rod Steiger once gave her a copy of Stanislavsky's writings on acting. ''I still have it,'' she said some years later, ''but I've never read it.''         The landmarks in Ms. Bancroft's acting life were, unquestionably, the two Gibson plays and ''The Graduate.'' She had already accumulated a long list of credits in TV dramas when she moved to Hollywood in the early 1950's to join the crowd of young hopefuls jostling for jobs in second- or third-rate films. She was among the few who found steady work, appearing in more than a dozen grade-C features with titles like ''Treasure of the Golden Condor,'' ''Gorilla at Large'' -- ''I played the title role'' -- and ''Demetrius and the Gladiators.'' Disenchanted after five years or so, and newly divorced, she headed back to New York with the promise of an audition for a new Broadway play called ''Two for the Seesaw.''         It was a two-character play, with Henry Fonda starring as a depressed Midwestern lawyer with marital troubles who comes to New York and meets Gittel Mosca, an attractive, thoroughly quirky young bohemian girl from the Bronx. They are two lost souls who, though their life styles are worlds apart, manage to help one another. Ms. Bancroft, who happened to be not only attractive and quirky but also Bronx-born and raised, auditioned and got the job. After a rocky start -- she had virtually no stage experience -- she quickly settled into the role. When the play opened in 1958, Ms. Bancroft stole the show and ultimately won a Tony Award as best supporting actress.         When the next Gibson-Penn theater project took shape the following year -- the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan -- they knew who would play Sullivan from Day 1. The part of the hostile, 10-year-old Helen went to Patty Duke. Between them, Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke tore up the stage as Sullivan struggled to communicate with and calm her raging young charge, eventually breaking through the child's defensive shell. ''The Miracle Worker'' was a resounding hit, and Ms. Bancroft came away with her second Tony Award, this time as best actress. Tonys also went to Mr. Penn, Mr. Gibson and the play's producer, Fred Coe. Two years, two plays, two Tonys. And when ''The Miracle Worker'' was made into a film in 1962, both Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke won Academy Awards.         Hollywood now had a new star, and Ms. Bancroft was offered scripts rather better than, say, ''Gorilla at Large.'' She appeared with Peter Finch in ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1964), Harold Pinter's adaptation of a novel by Penelope Mortimer about a woman driven into a nervous breakdown by her husband's casual philandering. Her work brought her an Oscar nomination. Next came ''The Slender Thread'' (1965), in which she played a housewife whose crumbling marriage leads her to attempt suicide.         By the time ''The Graduate'' came along, she was more than ready to play the alpha female and she got her wish with the character of Mrs. Robinson, the bored predator whose sexual binges with young Benjamin Braddock, the son of her husband's law partner are mechanical but necessary props for her self-indulgent ego. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a melancholic soundtrack of songs by Simon and Garfunkel, ''The Graduate'' was hailed as a winning social satire. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called it ''devastating and uproarious'' and hailed Ms. Bancroft's ''sullenly contemptuous and voracious performance.'' Mr. Nichols won an Oscar, while nominations went to Ms. Bancroft, Mr. Hoffman and Katharine Ross, who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The still photograph that appeared in advertisements for the film, showing Mrs. Robinson slowly peeling off a nylon stocking under the glazed gaze of Mr. Hoffman's Benjamin, became a classic of its kind.         Anna Maria Louisa Italiano was born on Sept. 17, 1931, in the Bronx to Italian immigrant parents. Her father, Michael, was a patternmaker, and her mother, Mildred, a telephone operator. By the time she was 2 years old she was learning to sing and dance. ''Why play with dolls,'' she recalled years later, ''when you can sing 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' on the street corner?'' Even so, by the time she left high school she had decided to become a laboratory technician. Instead, her mother insisted that she attend the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Two years later she found work in television where, as Anne Marno, she appeared in scores of dramatic shows. In 1951 she was asked to participate in another actor's screen test for 20th Century Fox, after which she, not he, was offered the contract that took her to Hollywood. At the studio she was handed a book of names and urged to choose a new one. She became Anne Bancroft. She had no illusions about that chapter of her film career, noting some years later that ''20th Century Fox told me what to do and I did it. I learned nothing.''         During her first stay in Hollywood she married Martin A. May, a building contractor, in 1954. They were divorced in 1957. In 1964 she married Mr. Brooks, who survives her, as does their son, Maximilian. Also surviving are her mother and two sisters, Joanne and Phyllis.         In the 1970's and 80's Ms. Bancroft took on a variety of roles, from Winston Churchill's American-born mother in ''Young Winston'' to the actress-wife of a hammy Polish impresario (''world famous in Poland''), played by Mr. Brooks, in the farcical ''To Be or Not to Be.'' She also earned two more Oscar nominations, one for her portrayal of a ballerina confronting her choice of career over family in ''The Turning Point,'' the other for her work as a mother superior in ''Agnes of God.'' Other major roles included '''Night Mother,'' as a woman struggling with her daughter's decision to commit suicide, and ''84 Charing Cross Road,'' in which she played an American writer whose correspondence with a London bookseller (Anthony Hopkins) develops into a long-distance romance.         She rarely returned to the theater, although she did win praise as the steel-willed Regina Giddens in Mr. Nichols's 1967 staging of Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In The Times, Clive Barnes characterized her performance as ''a series of unforgettable visual and aural images.'' The following year Ms. Bancroft appeared in the Lincoln Center Repertory production of another William Gibson drama, ''A Cry of Players,'' set in Shakespearean England. Her performance in ''Golda'' (1977) brought her a Tony nomination. She played a crippled violinist the 1981 ''Duet for One,'' which closed after a two-week run, and then was absent from the stage until the spring of 2002, when she was set to star in Edward Albee's ''Occupant'' as the sculptor Louise Nevelson. The play's scheduled run had to be canceled when Ms. Bancroft contracted pneumonia during previews.         In later years she continued to appear in films, although the roles grew smaller. She was briefly on screen as Nicolas Cage's mother in ''Honeymoon in Vegas,'' trained a young woman as an assassin in ''Point of No Return,'' scored a few points as a wily Senator in ''G.I. Jane'' and had some campy fun in an updated version of ''Great Expectations'' as a loony character based on Dickens's Miss Havisham.         She fared better in television, earning Emmy nominations playing a killer in the PBS drama ''Mrs. Cage'' and the title role in ''Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' on CBS.         She was resigned to the fact that age and changing times worked against her. In a 1992 interview in The Times she admitted to taking parts ''even if they're one page,'' because ''there are very few good scripts, even for Julia Roberts.'' She preferred a good bit part to a heftier bad one. She often rejected work in favor of family life -- for a while. ''I retire after every project,'' she once said. ''Then somehow there's always something that pulls me out of retirement.''         Correction:  June 18, 2005, Saturday  The obituary of the actress Anne Bancroft on June 8 misstated the name of the acting school she attended and omitted a major award. The school was the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, not the New York Academy. Ms. Bancroft won an Emmy in 1999 for best supporting actress in a mini-series, for the CBS drama ''Deep in My Heart.''       
         Frances Langford, a mellow contralto who ventured into combat zones with Bob Hope's troupe during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars to serenade tens of thousands of servicemen with ballads that reminded them of the girls they left behind, died yesterday at her home in Jensen Beach, Fla. She was 92.         Her death was announced by her lawyer, Evans Crary Jr., The Associated Press reported.         Although she regarded herself as more of a singer than an actress, she appeared in roughly 30 films and was half of the successful radio comedy duo ''The Bickersons,'' in which she and Don Ameche played a mismatched, querulous couple. He was devoted to ignoring her and concentrating on sleeping, the only time in the day, he said, when he felt alive; she was an insomniac who needed him as a refuge because she couldn't get to sleep. The show became so popular that it received a Sunday night spot of its own.         But among radio listeners, moviegoers and later a vast audience of G.I.'s, Miss Langford was known for songs like ''I'm in the Mood for Love,'' ''You Are My Lucky Star'' and ''Hooray for Hollywood.''         Mr. Hope thought of her as one of his three gypsies -- entertainers who were willing, like him, to travel all over the globe to entertain the troops. The other two were Jerry Colonna, a bulgy-eyed comic who liked to sing ''On the Road to Mandalay,'' and Tony Romano, a guitarist who sang, arranged and accompanied other talent.         Mr. Hope recalled her with characteristic snip: ''She knows just how much sex to pour and still be dignified.'' The troops frequently asked Miss Langford to sing ''I'm in the Mood for Love,'' a ballad by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh, her hit record from an otherwise forgettable 1935 movie, ''Every Night at Eight,'' which was mostly a vehicle for George Raft and Alice Faye.         ''The greatest thing in my life was entertaining the troops,'' Miss Langford told The Palm Beach Post years later. She said she was fascinated as well as frightened by being in or close to combat zones. On one occasion, near Bizerte in North Africa, she saw six planes shot down. On two occasions she was in planes that developed engine trouble; one of them crash-landed in New South Wales, Australia, on a flight from Guadalcanal. The other plane landed safely, but not before Miss Langford volunteered to don a parachute and jump.         Frances Langford was born April 6, 1913, in Lakeland, Fla., the daughter of Vasco Langford, a carpenter, and his wife, Anna, who was an accomplished pianist. She attended music college briefly but dropped out and began to work in vaudeville. Her first big break came after her mother drove her to Miami and convinced Rudy Vallee, then a popular star of stage and screen, to listen to her. He liked what he heard, asked her to sing on his radio show and even helped her get a start in New York. A small part in a Broadway musical led to radio appearances and a string of movie musicals.         In 1941, Miss Langford made her first appearance on Mr. Hope's radio show, and the visits to the troops started shortly thereafter. She also wrote a column for Hearst newspapers, recounting some of her experiences as an entertainer in wartime.         After the war, she was featured on a radio variety show and returned to nightclub work. She was married three times, first to the actor Jon Hall, from whom she was later divorced, and then to Ralph Evinrude, the manufacturer of outboard motors. They settled in Florida and started a marina, restaurant and gift shop near her 400-acre estate at Jensen Beach. She became more interested in sailing and fishing than singing, but on occasion she would sing at the restaurant.         Mr. Evinrude died in 1986. In 1994, she married Harold Stuart, an assistant secretary of the Air Force in the Truman administration, who survives her.       
         Edith I. Spivack, a tireless lawyer who worked for the New York City Law Department from 1934, when few other women were government lawyers, until last year, when she reluctantly stopped showing up four days a week, died on Tuesday at St. Francis Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 95.         The cause was complications of a fall, a daughter, Amy Bass, said.         The Law Department, New York City's legal advocate, has 650 lawyers, making it the third largest law firm in the city and one of the largest in the country. Having served 10 mayors and 23 corporation counsels, Ms. Spivack was by far the longest-serving civil servant in the department and quite possibly in the city.         A colleague, Jeffrey Friedlander, the first assistant corporation counsel, said that Ms. Spivack's formal expertise was tax law. But, he added, her wide-ranging legal knowledge, administrative ability and extensive institutional memory were ''the support behind the men who had the titles.''         Indeed, if Ms. Spivack had been born a man, Mr. Friedlander said, she would not have worked in obscurity for the many decades that she did.         ''She was, essentially, the power behind the throne,'' he said. ''It was clear she was the brains.''         Her most important legal work came in the 1970's, when she was well into her 60's. She helped negotiate loans to keep the city out of bankruptcy. In the Penn Central Railroad bankruptcy, she helped collect many millions of dollars in real estate taxes. She successfully argued a major tax case, Walz v. Tax Commission, before the Supreme Court.         Short, small-boned, impeccably dressed, with a courtly manner from another era, she had a tart wit.         At a Christmas party last year at which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg awarded her a public service plaque, the mayor tried to make small talk and asked when she graduated from college. Ms. Spivack replied that she graduated from Barnard College in 1929.         The mayor said his mother had graduated from New York University in the same year. Ms. Spivack looked at the mayor and said, ''Well, I guess she couldn't get into Barnard.''         Ms. Spivack was born on April 19, 1910. She grew up in the Bronx and the Upper West Side, the daughter of a seller of cardboard boxes.         After graduating from Barnard at 19, she went to Columbia Law School. She married a fellow student, Bernard H. Goldstein, who died in 1998. She retained her maiden name as a tribute to her parents.         She is survived by Ms. Bass of Port Washington; another daughter, Rita Christopher Frank of Madison, Conn.; and four grandchildren.         Ms. Spivack was rejected by law firms, in part because of the Great Depression, but also, she maintained, because she was a woman and Jewish. When Fiorello H. La Guardia took office in 1934, political appointees were removed and replaced through civil service examination.         Told that the city had no money to pay her, Ms. Spivack worked in the Law Department as a volunteer and was finally hired at half salary: $1,700 a year.         In January 1980, the city began to force foreign consulates to pay their municipal water bills, but the consul general of Colombia refused.         After many telephone calls, she left a message: ''If a check is not delivered this afternoon to the corporation counsel's office, I'm coming up personally to shut off the water.'' The check arrived.         In the 1980's, Ms. Spivack took advantage of the elimination of mandatory retirement and continued to work until 1995, when she officially retired. After three weeks she returned to the department in an advisory capacity.         ''My mom didn't knit, never cooked, never drove,'' Ms. Bass said. ''She never typed. My mom was a professional woman, a professional lawyer.''         After the Penn Central bankruptcy, her efforts recovered $90 million in back taxes. ''For some reason, Penn Central made out the $90 million check directly to me,'' she recalled later. ''But being an honest woman, I handed it over to the city.''       
         Ernesta Drinker Ballard, who saved the Philadelphia Flower Show and transformed it from a horticultural beauty show into a spectacular international educational event, died Aug. 11 at the Cathedral Village retirement community in Philadelphia. She was 85 and formerly lived in the Chestnut Hill area of Philadelphia.         The cause was complications of a stroke, her family said.         For 18 years, from 1963 to 1981, she was the executive director of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. Early in that period, the society's annual flower show, which began in 1829 and eventually grew into the largest indoor flower show in the United States was faltering, and a two-year suspension was discussed. Mrs. Ballard argued that a suspension might be fatal and instead changed the content of the show, bringing it to international prominence.         An exhibitor herself, she directed the show for 17 years, until 1981. She opened it to amateur growers and used it as a teaching laboratory for a wider public. Last year's show covered more than 30 acres with flower, garden and landscape displays and competitions, and lectures, workshops and cooking demonstrations. It drew more than a quarter million visitors.         Under Mrs. Ballard's guidance, the event began to produce a financial surplus, which she used to start the Horticultural Society's community gardening program, Philadelphia Green. That program, which turns vacant lots into vegetable gardens and flower beds, became one of the largest such urban greening projects in the nation.         Mrs. Ballard also played a leading role in saving public monuments like the Swann Fountain on Logan Circle and restoring the buildings and grounds of Philadelphia's historic Fairmount Waterworks. She was a Fairmount Park commissioner for 21 years, until 2002.         Ernesta Drinker was born into a distinguished Philadelphia family, a daughter of a prominent lawyer, Harry Drinker, and Sophie Hutcheson Drinker, a feminist and author. She was not encouraged to attend college but graduated as an adult from the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women (now part of Temple University) in 1954, when she started her own greenhouse business.         Mrs. Ballard was also known as the ''godmother of Philadelphia feminism.'' She was a founder of local chapters of groups like the National Organization for Women and campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' (1963) by Betty Friedan propelled Mrs. Ballard toward feminism, and it was Ms. Friedan who invited her to start the NOW chapter. She was also a co-founder of Women's Way, a seminal Philadelphia fund-raising group that supports an array of women's organizations and causes.         Mrs. Ballard's husband, Frederic, a prominent lawyer and former president of the American Bonsai Association, died in 2001. She is survived by their son, Frederic L. Jr., of Bethesda, Md.; three daughters, Alice W. Ballard of Philadelphia, Sophie B. Bilezikian of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Ernesta Ballard of Ketchikan, Alaska; a sister, Cecilia D. Saltonstall of Exeter, N.H.; a brother, Henry Drinker of Bedford, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Constance Baker Motley, a civil rights lawyer who fought nearly every important civil rights case for two decades and then became the first black woman to serve as a federal judge, died yesterday at NYU Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Isolde Motley, her daughter-in-law.         Judge Motley was the first black woman to serve in the New York State Senate, as well as the first woman to be Manhattan borough president, a position that guaranteed her a voice in running the entire city under an earlier system of local government called the Board of Estimate.         Judge Motley was at the center of the firestorm that raged through the South in the two decades after World War II, as blacks and their white allies pressed to end the segregation that had gripped the region since Reconstruction. She visited the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in jail, sang freedom songs in churches that had been bombed, and spent a night under armed guard with Medgar Evers, the civil rights leader who was later murdered.         But her métier was in the quieter, painstaking preparation and presentation of lawsuits that paved the way to fuller societal participation by blacks. She dressed elegantly, spoke in a low, lilting voice and, in case after case, earned a reputation as the chief courtroom tactician of the civil rights movement.         Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama and other staunch segregationists yielded, kicking and screaming, to the verdicts of courts ruling against racial segregation. These huge victories were led by the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, led by Thurgood Marshall, for which Judge Motley, Jack Greenberg, Robert Carter and a handful of other underpaid, overworked lawyers labored.         In particular, she directed the legal campaign that resulted in the admission of James H. Meredith to the University of Mississippi in 1962. She argued 10 cases before the United States Supreme Court and won nine of them.         Judge Motley won cases that ended segregation in Memphis restaurants and at whites-only lunch counters in Birmingham, Ala. She fought for King's right to march in Albany, Ga. She played an important role in representing blacks seeking admission to the Universities of Florida, Georgia Alabama and Mississippi and Clemson College in South Carolina.         She helped write briefs in the landmark school desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and in later elementary-school integration cases.         Judge Motley was a tall, gracious and stately woman whose oft-stated goal was as simple as it was sometimes elusive: dignity for all people. Her personal approach was also dignified. When a reporter wrote that she had demanded some action by the court, she soon corrected him:         ''What do you mean 'I demanded the court'? You don't demand, you pray for relief or move for some action.''         Charlayne Hunter-Gault, whose admission to the University of Georgia was engineered by Mrs. Motley's legal finesse, described her courtroom cunning.         ''Mrs. Motley's style could be deceptive, often challenging a witness to get away with one lie after another without challenging them,'' she wrote in her book ''In My Place,'' published in 1992. ''It was as if she would lull them into an affirmation of their own arrogance, causing them to relax as she appeared to wander aimlessly off into and around left field, until she suddenly threw a curveball with so much skill and power it would knock them off their chair.''         As a black woman practicing law in the South, she endured gawking and more than a few physical threats. A local paper in Jackson, Miss., derided her as ''the Motley woman.''         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her as a judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York at the urging of Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, a Democrat, and with the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits, a Republican. The opposition of Southern senators like James O. Eastland, a Mississippi Democrat, was beaten back, and her appointment was confirmed. She became chief judge of the district in 1982 and senior judge in 1986.         Constance Baker was born on Sept. 14, 1921, in New Haven, the ninth of 12 children. Her parents came from the tiny Caribbean island Nevis at the beginning of the 20th century.         Her father worked as a chef for various Yale University student organizations, including Skull and Bones. She attended local schools in what was then an overwhelmingly white community.         One of her first experiences with discrimination came at 15, when she was turned away from a public beach because she was black.         She read books dealing with black history and became president of the local N.A.A.C.P. youth council. She decided that she wanted to be a lawyer, but her family lacked money to send their many children to college. After high school, she struggled to earn a living as a domestic worker.         When she was 18, she made a speech at local African-American social center that was heard by Clarence W. Blakeslee, a white businessman and philanthropist who sponsored the center. He was impressed and offered to finance her education.         She decided to attend Fisk University, a black college in Nashville, partly because she had never been to the South. In Nashville, she encountered a rigidly segregated society, and brought her parents a poignant souvenir: a sign that read ''Colored Only.''         After a year and a half at Fisk, she transferred to New York University. After graduation in 1943, she entered Columbia Law School, where she began to work as a volunteer at the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, an affiliate of the National Organization for the Advancement of Colored People that Mr. Marshall and his mentor, Charles Houston, had created in 1939.         After she graduated in 1946, she began to work full time for the civil rights group at a salary of $50 a week. She worked first on housing cases, fighting to break the restrictive covenants that barred blacks from white neighborhoods.         Also in 1946, she married Joel Wilson Motley Jr., a New York real estate broker. He survives her, as does their son, Joel III, who lives in Scarborough, N.Y.; three grandchildren; her brother Edmund Baker of Florida; and her sisters Edna Carnegie, Eunice Royster and Marian Green, all of New Haven.         Mr. Marshall had no qualms about sending her into the tensest racial terrain, precisely because she was a woman. She said she believed that was why she was assigned to the Meredith case in 1961.         ''Thurgood says that the only people who are safe in the South are the women -- white and Negro,'' she said in an interview with Pictorial Living, the magazine of The New York Journal-American, in 1965. ''I don't know how he's got that figured. But, so far, I've never been subjected to any violence.''         Mr. Meredith's admission to the University of Mississippi in September 1962 was a major victory for the civil rights movement. Mrs. Motley worked on the case for 18 months before Mr. Meredith's name was even seen in the papers.         She made 22 trips to Mississippi as the case dragged on. Judge Motley once called the day Mr. Meredith accepted his diploma in 1963 the most thrilling in her life.         She said her greatest professional satisfaction came with the reinstatement of 1,100 black children in Birmingham who had been expelled for taking part in street demonstrations in the spring of 1963.         In February 1964, Mrs. Motley's high-level civil rights profile drew her into politics. A Democratic State Senate candidate from the Upper West Side was ruled off the ballot because of an election-law technicality. She accepted the nomination on the condition that it would not interfere with her N.A.A.C.P. work and handily defeated a Republican to become the first black woman elected to the State Senate. She was re-elected that November.         She remained in the job until February 1965, when she was chosen by unanimous vote of the City Council to fill a one-year vacancy as Manhattan borough president. In citywide elections nine months later, she was re-elected to a full four-year term with the endorsement of the Democratic, Republican and Liberal Parties.         As borough president, she drew up a seven-point program for the revitalization of Harlem and East Harlem, securing $700,000 to plan for those and other underprivileged areas of the city.         After becoming a federal judge in 1966, Judge Motley ruled in many cases, but her decisions often reflected her past. She decided on behalf of welfare recipients, low-income Medicaid patients and a prisoner who claimed to have been unconstitutionally punished by 372 days of solitary confinement, whom she awarded damages.         She continued to try cases after she took senior status. Her hope as a judge was that she would change the world for the better, she said.         ''The work I'm doing now will affect people's lives intimately,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1977, ''it may even change them.''         Correction:  October 5, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary on Thursday about Constance Baker Motley, the first black woman to serve as a federal judge, misstated the given name of her surviving brother and the means by which she was named to fill a vacancy as Manhattan borough president. Her brother is Edward Baker, not Edmund; she took office by a unanimous vote of the City Council members from Manhattan, not of the Council as a whole. The article also misstated part of the name of the civil rights organization that was then the parent of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund, for which Judge Motley began volunteer work in 1943. It is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People -- not National Organization.       
         Constance Cummings, a versatile American actress who lived mostly in England and, in a more glamorous age of liners and ocean crossings, captivated audiences on both sides of the Atlantic in a long stage, screen and television career, died on Wednesday in a nursing home in Oxfordshire. She was 95.         Her death was confirmed by her son, Dr. Jonathan Levy.         Starting as a teenage chorus girl in New York in 1928, Ms. Cummings appeared in several Broadway shows, caught the eye of a Hollywood mogul in 1930 and was soon playing flappers, molls and ingénues in a skein of films heavy on romance, blazing guns and sedans careening along dark roads.         From that inauspicious apprenticeship, she climbed on rungs of talent and drive to become a serious and celebrated actress in New York and London. She took on plays by Shakespeare, Sartre, Shaw, Edward Albee, Tennessee Williams and others, and with them more complex roles: vulgar women, ambitious schemers, witless socialites and victims of drugs, alcohol and stroke.         Ms. Cummings's finest performance, many critics said, was as Mary Tyrone, the frail matriarch of an Irish-American family, in the 1971 London revival of ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical tale of a dysfunctional family's day of disintegration.         Playing opposite Laurence Olivier at the National Theater, Ms. Cummings delivered a subtle and hypnotic portrayal of transformation, from a gentle maternal presence to the spectral morphine addict of the last act. Clive Barnes, in a review for The New York Times, called it ''one of the most compelling O'Neill productions I have ever seen -- terrifying in its intensity and uncompromising honesty.''         In the 1979 Broadway production of Arthur Kopit's ''Wings,'' Ms. Cummings bewitched theatergoers in the role she called the most demanding of her career: Emily Stilson, a one-time aviator and wing-walker, stricken by a cerebral hemorrhage and groping in the chaotic landscape of her broken mind.         To be in the audience, critics said, was to be inside her consciousness, lost in the silent pandemonium of the stroke. A ticking clock falters, then stops. The lamp flickers out. She sits alone in the darkness, bewildered by jumbled memories, terrifying voices. Have I crashed in a strange country? Are the doctors Romanians? Why are they talking gibberish? Why can't they understand my perfectly lucid answers? Is this a snowstorm? What is a toothbrush? Who am I?         Richard Eder, in a review for The Times, called her performance ''by far the most distinguished work to open on Broadway this season.'' Ms. Cummings shared the Tony award for best actress that year with Carole Shelley, who was cited for her role in ''The Elephant Man.''         Ms. Cummings made more than 40 American and British films, most of them in the 1930's and 40's -- a canon of romantic comedies, farces and potboilers co-starring the likes of Harold Lloyd, George Raft, Robert Young and Spencer Tracy. It was her 1945 role in the screen adaptation of Noël Coward's ''Blithe Spirit,'' with Rex Harrison, that made her an international star.         But as her dramatic range widened, she became better known for her perishable stage work than her film roles. In the 1950's and 60's, she made only eight movies, but performed in scores of plays on Broadway, in the West End and at the National Theater in London, and elsewhere in Britain and Europe.         In London, she was in Joseph Kramm's ''Shrike'' (1953), with Sam Wanamaker; Clifford Odets's ''Winter Journey'' (1952), with Michael Redgrave; Aristophanes' ''Lysistrata'' (1957); Sartre's ''Huis Clos'' (''No Exit,'' 1962); Max Beerbohm's ''Social Success'' (1962); and as Martha, the alcoholic campus wife, in Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' (1964).         In her twilight years, Ms. Cummings appeared in revivals of ''The Chalk Garden'' in New York and ''Mrs. Warren's Profession'' in Vienna, both in 1982; in a 1983 television version of ''Wings,'' filmed for the American Playhouse series on PBS; and in a London production of ''The Glass Menagerie'' in 1985. Her last television movie was ''Dead Man's Folly,'' an Agatha Christie mystery with Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot, on CBS in 1986. Her West End finale was in ''Uncle Vanya,'' in 1999.         Constance Cummings was born Constance Halverstadt -- she took her mother's maiden name professionally -- in Seattle on May 15, 1910, the daughter of a lawyer and a concert soprano. She was stage-struck early, studied classical dancing and performed in summer stock at 16. Two years later, accompanied by her mother, she went to New York, where she got into the chorus line of a Broadway musical.         By 1930, she had caught the eye of Samuel Goldwyn, and went to Hollywood to co-star with Ronald Coleman in ''The Devil to Pay.'' Unexpectedly replaced by Loretta Young, she jumped to Columbia and made her first film, ''The Criminal Code,'' in 1931, with Walter Huston. She appeared in 21 more movies over the next four years, most notably ''Movie Crazy,'' with Harold Lloyd.         In Hollywood, she met the British playwright and director Benn W. Levy, who was there to do a script. They were married in 1933 and settled in London a year later. She had to win a court fight with Columbia to make movies in Britain. But by 1935, she was one of the most sought after film stars on either side of the Atlantic. She also began appearing on the stage again, in London and New York.         Many of her plays in the 1940's and 50's were written or directed by her husband, who became a Labor member of Parliament after World War II and a prominent campaigner for nuclear disarmament.         In her heyday, Ms. Cummings cut a glamorous figure, a gray-eyed, auburn-haired beauty toasted in Hollywood, New York and London. Her trans-Atlantic sailings made little items in the newspapers.         In 1974, Ms. Cummings was named a Commander of the British Empire for her contributions to entertainment. She had spent so many years in England -- living in London and on a 600-acre farm in Oxfordshire -- and spoke British English with so slight an accent that many Americans assumed she was British. Her husband died in 1973. In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Jemima Levy. Both live in Oxford.         Correction:  November 30, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary yesterday about Constance Cummings, a stage and screen actress, misspelled the surname of the co-star of the film ''The Devil to Pay!'' (1930), in which she was replaced by Loretta Young. He was Ronald Colman, not Coleman.       
         Rona Jaffe, the preternaturally youthful writer whose 1958 novel ''The Best of Everything'' told the melodramatic story of four nubile, cashmere-sweatered career girls torn between storybook romance and cutthroat corporate Manhattan, died yesterday at University College Hospital in London, where she was on vacation. She was 74.         She died of cancer, said Alan C. Rothfeld, her lawyer and longtime friend.         Essentially commissioned by the movie producer Jerry Wald, Ms. Jaffe was a 25-year-old former associate editor in publishing when she sat down to write a book that Mr. Wald could turn into a blockbuster feature like ''Kitty Foyle: The Natural History of a Woman,'' a 1940 film that won Ginger Rogers an Academy Award for playing a plucky working girl who finds love, heartache, an unwanted pregnancy and, finally, romantic redemption. Published by Simon & Schuster, ''The Best of Everything,'' which drew on Ms. Jaffe's four-year employment at Fawcett Publications, as well as the experiences of close friends, was the urban answer to ''Peyton Place,'' Grace Metalious's risqué novel of lust in small-town America, which had been published two years earlier.         Ms. Jaffe's beautiful heroines -- Caroline, April, Barbara and Gregg -- toil as stenographers but are distracted by men, most of them cads, not to mention a lecherous boss called Mr. Shalimar. As Martin Levin of The New York Times wrote in a review of the book: ''Before very many coffee breaks one is a stretcher case, one is pregnant and the third is off to Las Vegas with a notorious lounge lizard. But that's the life of a working girl, at least as seen through Miss Jaffe's wide eyes.''         Critics howled, but America was entranced, which is precisely what its editor, Robert Gottlieb, was sure would happen. ''It was a basic story -- three or four or five girls start off together, one finds love, one goes crazy and/or dies, and one of them becomes a huge success -- but Rona's take was very up-to-date,'' Mr. Gottlieb said last night in a telephone interview. ''What made it work for the time was that it had a fresh young-career-women-in-New York quality with a fillip of shock.''         The synergy of its canny packaging as a book written expressly for Hollywood production was equally shocking at the time. Within two weeks of publication, the book was on the New York Times best-seller list, where it stayed for five months.         Less than a year later, thanks to Jerry Wald's involvement, ''The Best of Everything'' was released as a chic but heavy-handed film by 20th Century Fox and the director Jean Negulesco. The heroines' work site, Fabian Publishing, was set in the brand-new Seagram Building, and some of the sets were designed in seeming homage to a hot New York society decorator of the moment, Michael Greer. In a review of the movie's release on DVD last summer, Amy Nicholson of the Web site digsmagazine.com described its melodramatic, nail-biting charms as best accompanied by ''bonbons, chilled blush wine and possibly an emergency hanky.''         Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Martha Hyer and the 1950's supermodel Suzy Parker starred as the young women about town. Joan Crawford made a special appearance as Amanda Farrow, an ill-tempered book editor who, the film makes pointedly clear, has sacrificed personal happiness for professional glory. But it was Ms. Jaffe who went in a relative nobody and came back a star.         Born in 1931 in Brooklyn, Ms. Jaffe grew up in posh circumstances on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the only child of Samuel Jaffe, an elementary-school principal, and his first wife, Diana, a high-strung socialite who had an independent fortune and a suburban estate in Connecticut. Her maternal grandfather was Moses Ginsberg, a millionaire construction magnate who built the Carlyle hotel.         Unlike her rather passive fictional characters, however, the tough-talking Ms. Jaffe was professionally ambitious and openly spoke of her desire to be a success. After graduating from the Dalton School at 15 and Radcliffe College four years later, she became a file clerk at Fawcett, eventually becoming an associate editor before leaving to write ''The Best of Everything.''         Like many of her characters, she had numerous romantic adventures, including a relationship with an Astor real estate heir. Ms. Jaffe did not, however, ever marry, preferring to avoid what she once dismissively described as ''the rat race to the altar.'' She leaves no survivors.         In the decades that followed ''The Best of Everything,'' Ms. Jaffe wrote 15 more popular books, several of which used the quartet-of-women narrative approach, including ''The Last Chance,'' a 1976 novel that one reviewer described as ''best devoured alone in bed, with a container of yogurt,'' and ''Class Reunion,'' a sudsy 1979 novel about three decades in the lives of four Radcliffe classmates, one of whom has a gay husband. Her last book was ''The Room-Mating Season,'' published in 2003. Mr. Gottlieb said he believed that her finest work was ''Mr. Right Is Dead,'' a 1965 collection of short stories and the title novella, about a call girl.         In her later years, Ms. Jaffe established herself as a patron of the arts. In 1995, she established the Rona Jaffe Foundation, which provides grants to emerging female writers. ''All writers need support, but many women in early career have fewer resources available to them and often many demands made upon them,'' Ms. Jaffe said in September at an awards ceremony. ''It gives me great pleasure to help some of them make their way at this early stage.''       
         Selma Jeanne Cohen, a historian, editor and teacher who devoted her career to proclaiming dance an art worthy of the same scholarly respect traditionally awarded to painting, music and literature, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 85.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said Leslie Steinau, her lawyer and a longtime friend.         Ms. Cohen waged a tireless campaign against scholars who maintained that dance was inherently frivolous. Instead, she believed it had a rich history that could be fruitfully analyzed from many philosophical viewpoints. Her efforts led her to become America's leading figure in dance scholarship.         Her most ambitious achievement was her editing of The International Encyclopedia of Dance for Oxford University Press. Published in 1998 after two decades of planning, and encompassing all forms of dance, the six-volume work, modeled on The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, remains the most comprehensive guide of its kind.         Eclectic scholarly interests had prompted Ms. Cohen, A. J.Pischl and Sheppard Black in 1959 to found Dance Perspectives, a journal dedicated to monographs on various aspects of world dance. Ms. Cohen became its sole editor in 1966. After it ceased publication in 1976, the Dance Perspectives Foundation, which she had established, continued to award an annual prize for the best dance book of the year.         Ms. Cohen was born in Chicago, attended elementary and high school at the University of Chicago Laboratory School and went on to the university itself, receiving a Ph.D. in English in 1946.         When a childhood friend started taking ballet lessons from Edna McRae, a respected Chicago teacher, Ms. Cohen went along. Ms. Cohen soon realized she had no dancing talent. But she had great curiosity, and McRae had a dance library, which Ms. Cohen devoured.         She began teaching English at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1946 and, at the same time, worked with the Los Angeles teacher and choreographer Eugene Loring. After moving to New York in 1953, she devoted herself to dance and started reviewing for Dance Observer. From 1955 to 1958 she was a dance critic at The New York Times, where she assisted John Martin, who was chief dance critic. She was dance critic for The Saturday Review in 1965 and 1966.         Ms. Cohen was a member of the first National Endowment for the Arts Dance Panel in 1966; organized a critics' conference at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn., in 1970; and taught over the years at many colleges, including the University of Chicago, where she returned to head summer seminars from 1974 to 1976. Ms. Cohen wrote and edited several important books, among them ''The Modern Dance: Seven Statements of Belief'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1966), an anthology of essays by contemporary choreographers; ''Doris Humphrey: An Artist First'' (Wesleyan, 1972), a biography of a pioneering modern dancer; and ''Next Week, Swan Lake'' (Wesleyan, 1982), a study of dance aesthetics. Her ''Dance as a Theater Art'' (Dodd, Mead, 1974), a history of dance since the Renaissance, remains a popular college text.         Ms. Cohen, a tiny soft-spoken woman, could be a rigorous teacher, but she delighted in presiding graciously over social events. Friends, colleagues and students often met informally at her apartment, gatherings usually graced by Giselle, her long-lived and much-pampered cat. Ms. Cohen often jokingly said she hoped to write a treatise on feline aesthetics someday.         No immediate family members survive.
