         Theresa Bernstein, who as a member of the Ash Can School of realistic painting was both hailed and flailed for ''painting like a man'' in the 1910's and then continued to generate vibrant canvases for eight more decades, died in Manhattan on Tuesday. She was generally believed to be 111 and lived in Manhattan and Gloucester, Mass.         She died at Mount Sinai Hospital, Suzanne Laurier, a friend for 23 years, said. Ms. Laurier said she had reason to believe Ms. Bernstein may have been as much as five years older, a view others echo.         Ms. Bernstein, who has no survivors, was never particularly helpful on the subject.         ''I'm old enough to keep it to myself,'' she said in an interview with The Boston Globe in 1998.         Her paintings now sell for $100,000  in galleries. She originally gained recognition as one of the first women to paint in the Realist style, favoring the informal composition and contemporary subject matter typical of the movement. She hardly advertised her sex: she signed her gritty paintings of urban scenes with her last name or ''T. Bernstein.''         Indeed, at the beginning of her career, the important thing to some seemed to be that she had somehow transcended being a woman.         ''It is with a man's vision that this artist looks at her subjects -- in the streets, the elevated trains, at the beaches, in the parks, the lobbies of theaters, in seaport places or in a church,'' Frederick James Gregg wrote in The New York Herald in a review of her first solo show in 1919.         ''Then having found what she wants, it is with a man's vigor that she gets it down to stay,'' he continued.         Writing in the American Art Review in April 2001, Patricia M. Burnham countered that Ms. Bernstein, for all her so-called ''masculine'' vigor, showed a decidedly feminine sensibility.         ''She saw as a woman, perceived the city and its hustle and bustle very much from a woman's point of view,'' she wrote. ''As a result, she incorporated into her art types and activities ignored by her male counterparts: women readers using the New York Public Library, traveling unchaperoned on the el, making hats, creating art in the company of other women, applying for jobs.''         Others insist that her work, as particularly evidenced by her forceful brush strokes, spoke for itself.         ''She was just a great painter, period,'' said Jan Ramirez, director of the New-York Historical Society's museum.         When Ms. Ramirez organized an exhibition of Ms. Bernstein's work in 1991, in her previous job as a curator at the Museum of the City of New York, it was Ms. Bernstein's first museum exhibition since 1948. There have since been museum exhibitions in Philadelphia, Boston and Stamford, Conn., and three one-person shows at Joan Whalen Fine Art in Manhattan.         Her paintings are in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian Institution, the Chicago Art Institute, the New York Public Library and the Brooklyn Museum. She has had more than 40 solo exhibitions.         Ms. Bernstein admitted to being born on March 1, 1890, according to several published accounts. But Ms. Laurier, who knew Ms. Bernstein's husband of 62 years, the painter and etcher William Meyerowitz, said he told her and others that his wife was two years older than he was; if so, she would have turned 116 in two weeks.         Records of the Philadelphia School of Design for Women indicate, however, that Ms. Bernstein enrolled in 1907 at age 17, making her 111 at her death.         Her father was a textile manufacturer and her mother an accomplished pianist. As a girl, she made several trips to Europe with her mother and was impressed by Expressionist painters like Edvard Munch. After attending the Philadelphia art school, now the Moore College of Art and Design, she moved to New York and joined the Art Students League, where she studied portrait painting with William Merritt Chase.         She met Mr. Meyerowitz when he noticed one of her paintings at a show and dropped by to ask her for a donation to a charity that gave artworks to the poor.         ''Oh, I thought you were an older man,'' Mr. Meyerowitz said to Ms. Bernstein, who was then probably 29. She gave him several paintings, and their courtship started. Shortly after they were married, she had a baby girl named Isadora, who died two months later.         The two often painted side by side, but Mr. Meyerowitz was much more publicly prominent. Three years after his death, she revealed hundreds of her own paintings.         When she visited the Museum of the City of New York in the late 1980's to discuss a possible exhibition of her husband's work, curators decided to exhibit her work instead.         ''All told, his subject matter is not in any way revolutionary,'' Ms. Ramirez said. ''She was far more the iconoclast of the two.''         She loved to paint groups of people. Her studies of suffrage parades in 1912 led to a series of works from 1916 to 1919 that documented the patriotic displays of World War I. She became close to members of The Eight, as the Ashcan School was also called, and her urban landscapes reflected this influence.         She was also associated with the Philadelphia 10, a group of women who had studied art in Philadelphia.         Her early reputation was suggested by a review in The New York Times on March 13, 1927, comparing the emotions evoked by her art to ''this little cavorting fling that reminds one of colts in pasture.''         By the 1930's, she did not follow the art world toward greater abstraction, though her husband did. Even as her palate exploded with inspired colors -- salmon skies and chartreuse cheeks -- her mission became one of breaking down the barrier between high art and everyday people.         ''In some ways, Bernstein is a Thornton Wilder of the canvas, '' Ms. Burnham wrote, offering ''consoling and nostalgic images to viewers of the 21st century.''         Her determination was legendary. When she broke her right hand, she painted with her left. When she could no longer hold a brush, she painted by squirting paint from tubes.         And she never lost her eye for a touching scene. On a Valentine's Day several years ago, Ms. Laurier pushed her wheelchair past a store where a couple were kissing in the window as part of a promotion.         ''Get my sketch pad,'' Ms. Bernstein commanded.       
         Maida Stocker Abrams, a prominent collector of Dutch art and an advocate for the disabled, died last Thursday in Boston. She was 63 and lived in Newton, Mass.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Abrams and her husband, George Abrams, a lawyer, built one of the country's major private collections of 17th-century Dutch drawings, including works by Rembrandt and Bruegel.         ''Theirs is probably the most remarkable collection of Dutch old master drawings put together ever in America,'' Martin Royalton-Kisch, curator of Dutch and Flemish drawings at the British Museum, said when the couple donated a portion of their collection to the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard University in 1999.         The Abramses began collecting shortly after they married, in 1960. As a young lawyer, Mr. Abrams had worked for the Dutch government and developed an interest in Dutch and Flemish art. The couple started buying drawings, Mr. Abrams said, because they were less expensive than paintings; at the time a drawing could cost as little as $1,000.         The 110 drawings they gave to the Fogg were estimated at $20 million, and they still had hundreds of drawings and paintings left.         Mrs. Abrams was also a passionate activist for art education for the disabled. In 1980 she founded the nonprofit group Very Special Arts Massachusetts, which develops arts programs in schools throughout the state. She also worked with cultural institutions to improve access for those with disabilities.         Born in New York City, Mrs. Abrams graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville and Lesley College in Cambridge, Mass. She trained as a registered occupational therapist at the Tufts Boston School of Occupational Therapy, and in 1987 she was awarded an honorary doctorate in education by Wheelock College in Boston. Ms. Abrams worked as an art therapist at the League School of Boston from 1964 to 1972 and was an arts specialist in special education in the Newton public schools from 1969 to 1984.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her two daughters, Sarah Abrams and Rebecca Abrams Benn, both of New York City; a brother, Michael Stocker, of Syracuse and New York City; and a grandson.       
         Elka Spoerri, an art historian and curator who unlocked the riches of the art of Adolf Wölfli, died May 17 at her home in Bern, Switzerland. She was 77 and lived in Bern and New York.         She died of cancer, said her son, Anselm.         Mrs. Spoerri, who sometimes jokingly referred to herself as ''Mrs. Wölfli,'' was a legend in the world of outsider art. She spent more than 20 years deciphering, transcribing, translating and indexing the often densely interwoven writing, iconography and musical scores of Wölfli, a prolific schizophrenic Swiss laborer. Consigned to Waldau, a psychiatric hospital in Bern, from the age of 30 to his death at 66 in 1930, Wölfli created thousands of drawings and 45 large illustrated books containing a total of nearly 25,000 pages. He was known in Switzerland during his lifetime but subsequently slipped into near oblivion.         Mrs. Spoerri came to Wölfli's work through her husband, Theodor, a psychiatrist at Waldau who, at the invitation of the Swiss curator Harald Szeemann, helped reintroduce Wölfli's work to the art world at Documenta 5 in 1972. But Theodor, a cousin of the artist Daniel Spoerri, died in 1973, and Mrs. Spoerri became the chief guardian and interpreter of Wölfli's art.         In 1975 she became the founding curator of the Adolf Wölfli Foundation at the Kunstmuseum Bern. During the next 20 years her pioneering research broke the code of Wölfli's art and confirmed him as arguably one of the greatest artists of the 20th century. Her work contributed to a moment of stunning harmonic convergence in the early 1970's, when the heretofore small outsider-art field was rocked by such discoveries as the work of Martin Ramirez and Henry Darger -- like Wölfli, a universe-forming writer-artist.         Mrs. Spoerri was born Elka Zagaroff in Sofia, Bulgaria, in 1924, the daughter of a prominent economist. Her family became refugees in 1939, living in Berlin, southern Germany and Bern. She received most of her education at the University of Bern. Interested in contemporary art, she was co-writer of a lexicon of 20th-century Swiss artists, and over the years she maintained close friendships with artists like Meret Oppenheim, Markus Raetz, Joel Fisher and Joan Jonas.         Once diverted into Wölfli territory, Mrs. Spoerri discovered a vast continent. At the time of her husband's death, almost nothing was known about the contents of Wölfli's books, the bulk of his creation. Mrs. Spoerri parsed the constituent parts of their magnificent illustrations: the self-portraits, madonnas and animal forms and the powerful decorative patterns in which they were enmeshed. More important (and laborious), she also deciphered many of Wölfli's words, converting his partly invented Swiss-German into German and English.         Unraveling Wölfli's complex autobiographical narratives and rhythmic celebratory chants, she separated his real life's story from his imagined one, excavating an artist of extraordinary imagination but also sharp observations, as evidenced by his accounts of his impoverished childhood. It helped, she said, that she had been taught in Old German in elementary school in Bulgaria.         Mrs. Spoerri organized or worked on more than 30 exhibitions of Wölfli's work and edited or contributed to numerous Wölfli publications, including (with Dieter Schwarz) a two-volume version of his 2,970-page autobiography, ''From the Cradle to the Grave,'' and (with Max Wechsler) ''Geographical Book No. 11: Writings, 1912-1913.'' She retired from the Wölfli foundation in 1996 but was a curator, with her successor, Daniel Baumann, of the Wölfli retrospective that will open at the American Museum of Folk Art next January.         In addition to her son, a professor at Rutgers University who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by her sister, Radka Donnell, a poet and artist, of Cambridge, Mass., and her brother, Mitko Zagaroff, also of Cambridge, who is a chief engineer for the artists Christo and Jean-Claude.       
         Elizabeth Mongan, an expert in fine-art prints and drawings who helped to create a major collection at the National Gallery of Art in Washington, died on June 7 at her home in Rockport, Mass. She was 92.         From 1937 to 1963, Ms. Mongan was curator of the private print collection of Lessing J. Rosenwald, heir to the Sears, Roebuck fortune. Over the years, she helped steer him toward color prints from late-19th-  and 20th-century France as well as 20th-century Germany. The collection moved to the National Gallery in 1943, and she went with it as curator.         The Rosenwald Collection now has 22,000 historic and contemporary prints and is considered one of the country's largest and finest collections of historic art prints.         Ms. Mongan, a graduate of Bryn Mawr College, also collaborated on exhibitions, including ''The First Century of Printmaking, 1400 to 1500,'' a 1941 show at the Art Institute of Chicago. She wrote significant catalogs on Klee, Fragonard, Morisot, Daumier and Gauguin.         She retired from the National Gallery in 1963 and taught art history at Smith College from 1969 to 1975.       
         Phyllis Pray Bober, a scholar of Renaissance art and its relationship to classical antiquity, and a pioneering scholar in culinary history, died on May 30 at her home in Ardmore, Pa. She was 81.         Ms. Bober, a professor emerita of the humanities at Bryn Mawr, was known for her unusually wide range of interests, among them Roman provincial sculpture, Renaissance architectural theory, the history of collecting and antiquarianism, and the story of culture and cuisine.         Trained in archaeology at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University, she was chosen as a young scholar to organize a monumental project, ''The Census of Classical Works Known to the Renaissance,'' which remained her focus for more than 40 years. The census grew into the standard resource for the subject, and Ms. Bober considered it her most significant work.         She often lectured, however, on historical cooking, which she said offered lessons for the modern world regarding ''conservation of energy, nurture of our environment and elimination of food wastage.''         Ms. Bober was known for her lavish banquets that recreated past cuisines. For a class at Bryn Mawr, she prepared a Roman feast that included an entire wild boar roasted in a college oven. At Oxford University in 1992, she lectured on the culinary uses of marijuana during the Italian Renaissance.         Her 1999 book, ''Art, Culture and Cuisine: Ancient and Medieval Gastronomy'' (University of Chicago), explored connections between food and art from prehistory through the late Gothic period. She was working on a second volume, covering the Renaissance through the early 20th century, when she died. She also published ''Renaissance Artists and Antique Sculpture: A Handbook of Sources'' in 1986.         Ms. Bober founded the department of fine arts at the old Heights campus of New York University in the Bronx and served as its chairwoman from 1967 to 1973. In 1973 she became the dean of the Bryn Mawr College Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where she held appointments in two departments, art history and classical and Near Eastern archaeology.         She served as president of the College Art Association from 1988 to 1990; was elected to the Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei in Rome in 1995 and to the American Philosophical Society in 1999 and, because of her work in culinary history, to the Dames d'Escoffier in 1995.         She was married to the art historian Harry Bober; they divorced in 1973, and he died in 1988.         She is survived by her companion, Ted Barnett, of Philadelphia, and by two sons, Jonathan Bober, a curator at the Blanton Museum of Art at the University of Texas in Austin, and David Bober of New York.       
         Vera G. List, a forward-looking philanthropist whose causes included contemporary art, opera, education and social justice, died Thursday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 94.         Mrs. List, who received the National Medal of Arts from President Bill Clinton in 1996, was born Vera Glaser in 1908 in Brookline, Mass., the daughter of a housepainter from Latvia. She credited her interest in art and music to her mother, who despite an often constrained budget maintained a beautifully decorated house.         She attended Simmons College, and in 1930 married Albert A. List, from Fall River, Mass., who made his family's grocery the basis of a business empire that eventually included RKO Theaters.         Mrs. List began collecting art almost immediately. As her husband's wealth grew, her art purchases and their philanthropy kept pace. The saying in the family was that ''the money was his, the ideas were hers,'' her daughters said.         The Lists' beneficiaries included the Metropolitan Opera, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Jewish Theological Seminary, the Jewish Museum and the New School for Social Research, now New School University. They built art centers at M.I.T., Brown University and Swarthmore College, and endowed professorships at various universities and medical schools.         Mrs. List endowed art-lending programs (and provided them with prints) for students at the New School and M.I.T. Another endowment enabled New School students to attend the Metropolitan Opera for $5.         The Albert A. List Foundation, formed in the 1950's, donated money to the construction of Lincoln Center. The foundation also paid for much of the center's art, including the large two-piece sculpture by Henry Moore that dominates its reflecting pool.         Mrs. List was particularly proud of the List Art Posters program at Lincoln Center, which invited contemporary artists to design posters for cultural events.         Mrs. List also became an avid collector of modern and contemporary art, especially sculpture. The List family's sculpture collection included works by artists from Giacometti to Joel Shapiro and a full-length portrait of Mrs. List by George Segal.         Mrs. List was on the boards of the Jewish Museum and the American Federation of Arts. But she may be best known in the art world for helping Marcia Tucker, a former curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art, establish the New Museum of Contemporary Art, now in SoHo. It opened in 1977 in the Albert A. List Building at the New School on Fifth Avenue and 14th Street.         Although the Lists gave art to several New York museums, after her husband's death in 1987, Mrs. List sold much of her collection to have more money to give away. In her last years she supported programs with missions like reducing hate crimes or the birth rate. She liked to remember people by endowing lecture programs, like the one named for Barbara Jordan at the New School, or providing fellowships, like one for New School students from Poland, named for Katarzyna Kalwinska, a Polish Catholic who hid Jews who had escaped from concentration camps.         She is survived by three daughters, Olga Mack of New York City, Carol Schwartz of Denver, and Viki List, of Rosemont, Pa.; 11 grandchildren; and 23 great-grandchildren. One daughter, Jo Levinson, died last year.       
         Carole Kismaric, an innovative editor and book packager who helped start the Time-Life Photography Series and for 10 years was editorial director of the Aperture Foundation, a nonprofit publisher of fine-art photography books, died yesterday at her home in New York. She was 60.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her sister, Susan Kismaric, said.         While at Aperture, from 1976 to 1985, Ms. Kismaric was a force in changing the face of photography book publishing. At the start of her tenure, books of fine-art photography -- including Aperture's -- generally reproduced one picture per page, without caption or text and surrounded by a frame of white space, as if it were a framed print.         Working with the Aperture designer Wendy Byrne and others, she helped usher in a more flexible, magazine-influenced design approach, in which pictures might be reproduced across two pages and combined with text.         But her purpose was more than a matter of presentation: she sought to demonstrate how books of artistically bold pictures could also yield social and political meanings beyond the purview of art and thus appeal to broad audiences.         To further demonstrate how thoroughly photographs are ingrained in contemporary culture, in 1991 she joined with Marvin Heiferman, an independent curator and writer, to create Lookout, a partnership that developed and produced exhibitions and publications.         Among the exhibitions Lookout produced were ''Talking Pictures,'' a 1994 traveling exhibition that allowed museum visitors to listen to prerecorded commentaries about how the pictures had influenced the speakers' lives, and ''Paradise Now: Picturing the Genetic Revolution,'' a 2000 exhibition at Exit Art in New York that focused on artists' responses to the promise and perils of genetic research. Together with ''Fame After Photography,'' commissioned by the Museum of Modern Art, and ''To the Rescue: Artists in an Archive,'' a project based on the archive of the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee, these exhibitions were noted for their conceptual ingenuity and popular appeal.         Among the books produced by Ms. Kismaric and Mr. Heiferman under the Lookout name were ''Frida Kahlo: The Camera Seduced'' (Chronicle Books, 1992); ''Fay's Fairy Tales: Cinderella and Little Red Riding Hood,'' by William Wegman (Hyperion, 1993); and ''Love is Blind'' (PowerHouse, 1997). In addition, as publications director of the P.S. 1 Museum since 1985, Ms. Kismaric developed books on the artists John Coplans, David Hammons and Jack Smith.         Carole Kismaric was born on April 28, 1942, in Orange, N.J. As a student at Penn State University she majored in psychology, but after graduation in 1964 she pursued a career as a newspaper reporter. Time-Life Books hired her as a picture researcher in 1970. As an associate editor, she helped develop the Time-Life Photography Series and edited five of its titles.         In 1974 Ms. Kismaric collaborated with John Szarkowski, then director of photography at the Museum of Modern Art, on the exhibition ''From the Picture Press.'' The show consisted entirely of pictures pictures made for publication in newspapers and magazines.         When she joined Aperture in 1976, it was still associated with the aesthetic of its founding editor, the photographer Minor White. Working with Michael Hoffman, Aperture's publisher, she developed and edited more than 50 titles, including ''Diane Arbus: Magazine Work,'' ''The Eloquent Light'' by Ansel Adams, ''Telex Iran'' by Gilles Peress, and ''Social Graces'' by Larry Fink.         She also edited the quarterly magazine called Aperture, introducing to its pages a wide range of contemporary photographs far removed from the journal's traditional artistic roots.         After leaving Aperture in 1986, Ms. Kismaric struck out on her own and produced an exhibition and book, ''Forced Out: The Agony of the Refugee in Our Time'' (1989), under the auspices of the J. M. Kaplan Fund and Human Rights Watch. In 1990 she began teaching in the graduate photography program of the School of Visual Arts.         Ms. Kismaric was married to Charles Mikolaycak, a children' book illustrator. Mr. Mikolaycak died in 1993. She is survived by her sister, Susan.
