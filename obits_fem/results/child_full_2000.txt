         Anne Devenney, the spark plug of community organization who helped keep the tidy, solid neighborhoods of the northwest Bronx from turning into another burned-out urban slum, died Jan. 9 in the Bronx. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A former resident of Norwood, the Bronx, she recently lived with her daughters in Yonkers.         Mrs. Devenney was a founder, president emeritus and living legend of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition, which started in the mid-1970's. An umbrella organization for nine community groups, it champions home ownership, tenant-controlled housing, street safety and local investment.         ''She was a no-nonsense Bronx grandmother who took leadership of a whole part of the Bronx in some of its darkest times as the head of the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition,'' said the Bronx borough president, Fernando Ferrer, who had known her for some 20 years. ''She led the charge against arson for profit, housing deterioration and unresponsive politicians. She was a real original.''         At times, it seemed that her coalition was fighting sluggish bureaucracies and corporate obtuseness as much as the obvious symptoms of urban blight. It took on the problems of drug dealing, street crime, vacant buildings and the flight of residents that those things would set off, but it also attacked mortgage redlining and the deterioration of city services.         Anne O'Hanlon was a child of the Depression, the youngest of seven children born to Irish immigrant parents in Hell's Kitchen, on the West Side of Manhattan. She lived in tenements there, in Harlem and in Morningside Heights. As a teenager, she washed and ironed and scrubbed floors for the well-to-do on Riverside Drive for $1.25 a day.         She dropped out of high school and got a $12-a-week dime-store job, but returned to night classes to earn a high school diploma. A defining experience of her youth was the eviction of her family from their apartment house, which was demolished to make room for a ramp to the George Washington Bridge.         In 1941, she married John Devenney, and in 1956, the couple moved to Putnam Valley, N.Y., from which Mr. Devenney commuted to his draftsman's job in New York City. But the suburbs were not her natural habitat, and Mrs. Devenney later said that she hated being dependent on a car and that all the rain and snow and hard mud for months on end made her long for the swept pavements of the city.         In 1962, the family moved back to the Bronx into a fifth-floor five-room apartment on Perry Avenue, but in a few years, the ailments of the inner city moved into the neighborhood. Black and Hispanic refugees from the South Bronx moved in, with the causes of their flight in pursuit.         Landlords, frightened by the wave of arson sweeping the borough, began to neglect their buildings and even abandon them. Many white working-class families started to think of moving to other places for a haven. But Mrs. Devenney's upbringing among people of different races and creeds had taught her that the struggle against community destruction knew no color.         Banding together with members of the clergy and young community organizers, she began to haunt hallways and community centers, trying to shake people out of their complacency and into partnerships with residents of surrounding areas where the blight was setting in.         The result was the Northwest Bronx Community and Clergy Coalition. It and its affiliated groups badgered city officials for decent sanitation services and the money to keep streets, parks and other public places in good repair. They trooped to City Hall, demanding action against landlords who burned their buildings for the insurance money.         They homed in on redlining by insurers that refused to write policies in their neighborhoods for fear of losses and by banks that denied mortgages in the community despite the large amounts of deposits that they held from its residents.         Coalition members picketed corporate headquarters, invaded annual meetings with proxies from stock-owning churches, and met personally with politicians and executives who knew little of the people living in those communities.         Mrs. Devenney's husband died in 1993.         She is survived by two daughters, Betty Devenney and Carol Gibney, both of Yonkers; two sons, John, of Macon, Ga., and Joseph, of Mahopac, N.Y.; 14 grandchildren; and seven great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Devenney stayed in the forefront of the campaign for neighborhood survival until the late 1980's, negotiating with commissioners, mayors and banking and insurance executives for a fair share of city services and private-sector investment.         She described herself as ''conservative-liberal-radical,'' explaining, ''I have to be conservative because I want to conserve my neighborhood, liberal to keep my mind open and radical to carry a picket sign.''       
         Frances Messersmith Miner, who for 43 years nurtured tulips, radishes and children at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, died Monday in Utica, N.Y., her brother said. She was 94 and lived in a nursing home in nearby Clinton.         Miss Miner learned of the Brooklyn children's garden, the first to be included within a scientific botanic garden, as a freshman at Smith College when her botany professor mentioned it. She made a note that that was ''something I'd like to do.''         Seven years later, in 1930, she began working at the children's garden under the tutelage of its founder, Ellen Eddy Shaw, who began it in 1914 on a single acre of the 52-acre Brooklyn Botanic Garden.         Miss Miner, tall, slender and less frail than she seemed, looked as if she belonged in a garden: she favored straw hats and print dresses.         She relished getting down on her hands and knees to weed at a time when not many women did. Her title was curator of instruction, but she was called ''the botanic lady'' by generations of youngsters, some of whom were inspired to become influential gardeners as adults.         ''To me, she seemed to know everything,'' said Helen Mattin, who almost seven decades ago began crossing Washington Avenue as an 8-year-old to take classes and is now a major benefactor to the garden. ''It was great to be with someone who just poured out love to me.''         Scott Appell, who started gardening at 9 in 1963 and is now educational director at the Horticultural Society of New York, emphasized that Miss Miner provided much more than engaging baby-sitting. There were written tests, badges and medals for high achievement. Well-kept children's plots were marked with signs with a white star on a green background; those needing work got a sign with a blue question mark.         ''When we went to class on Saturday, it was just like being in school,'' he said. ''It was not informal at all. It was very hard. We were taught a sense of responsibility.''         A tangible example of the responsibility Miss Miner demanded was the care of gardening tools. Hoes, rakes and trowels dating back more than 80 years can be seen gleaming on the racks of the Children's Garden House, which last year was refurbished and named for Miss Miner.         Once, when tomato stakes needed painting, she bought green paint and asked the children to do it. Naturally, everybody went home green, but ''she knew that if the children painted the stakes, they would take better care of them,'' said Daphne Welch Day, a longtime colleague.         Miss Miner summed up her approach in a publication for the Brooklyn garden. ''I believe that students, especially beginners in this adventure, should be participants rather than spectators,'' she wrote. ''A feeling of ownership and a sense of responsibility for the care of a plant 'pet' elicit an entirely different kind of response than viewing displays of plants, no matter how spectacular.''         Miss Miner was born in Plainfield, N.J., and grew up in Oriskany Falls, N.Y. After graduating from Smith, she worked briefly with the Girl Scouts in Elmira, N.Y., then accepted a post at the Brooklyn garden as an educational assistant.         Friends quickly came to appreciate her sometimes quirky approach. She liked to be known by her initials, FMM. Each day she would jot notes on the subway to and from her home on 110th Street in Manhattan. They would be daily distributed to ''DW,'' ''AB,'' and her other colleagues.         She is survived by her brother Charles of Oriskany Falls.         In addition to writing about botanical topics for publications like the Journal of the Royal Horticultural Society in England, she wrote a 95-page children's book called ''The Adventure Book of Growing Plants.''         Her joy was seeing a child learn a  lesson about plants. She wrote of a boy named Johnny who despaired because his plants were thriving and healthy but lacked tomatoes. It turned out that Johnny was meticulously picking off the blossoms, which he called ''old yellow flowers.''         ''Johnny learned the hard way that a blossom is necessary to fruit production and that fruits lead to seed which in turn lead to new plants and more flowers,'' she wrote. ''Johnny took home more than tomatoes.''       
         Anne Hebert, a poet and novelist who brought the violent passions of her native rural Quebec to wider audiences in France and the United States, died on Jan. 23 at a hospital in Montreal. She was 83 and lived in Quebec City.         Part of a post-World War II generation of Quebecois intellectuals who breathed new life into fading language and cultural links with France, Ms. Hebert spent most of the last half century in Paris, explaining once: ''Montreal is too American, Quebec City is too small, and Paris is very, very beautiful.''         Despite the distractions of Paris, Ms. Hebert set seven of her eight novels in the rural Quebec she had known as a child. Reflecting on her trans-Atlantic vision, she once told an interviewer: ''You need distance. It helps you to better reflect on the issues and places you are writing about.''         Born in 1916 in a village outside of Quebec City, she spent her teenage years battling a series of life-threatening illnesses -- appendicitis, pleurisy and scarlet fever. Often isolated in quarantine, she voraciously read books and poetry, with many of the volumes supplied by a favorite cousin, a poet. In 1939 she published her first poems. In 1999 she published her last work, ''Un Habit de Lumiere,'' a novel.         Writing ''poetry is not the relaxation of the seventh day,'' she once said. ''It is thirst and hunger, bread and wine.'' Reflecting this serious, lifelong commitment to the writer's craft, she won Canada's most prestigious literary award, the Governor General's Award, at regular intervals: in 1960, in 1975 and in 1992.         The tortured isolation of her adolescence resurfaced in poems and novels that revolved around violent themes, rape and murder, in rural Quebec.         ''She stripped bare the lives of bourgeois families who hid their little hells,'' said Denise Boucher, a poet who is president of the Union of Quebec Writers. ''It was writing that rebelled against conformism.''         In 1970 Ms. Hebert won wide acclaim for her novel ''Kamouraska,'' a tale of adultery and murder set in a small northern Quebec village of her ancestors. In 1973 Claude Jutra turned the novel into a critically acclaimed movie, casting the French-Canadian actress Genevieve Bujold in the lead. Yves Simoneau based a movie on another of her novels, ''Les Fous de Bassan,'' translated into English as ''In the Shadow of the Wind.''         In 1982 France awarded the Prix Femina to this book, a dark tale about the disappearance of two teenage girls from an isolated English-speaking community in Quebec's Gaspe peninsula in the 1930's.         ''She used words like jewels, like gemstones that were sharp, clear and fine,'' said Sheila Fischman, who translated Ms. Hebert's last seven novels into English. The most recent translation was published last year under the title ''Am I Disturbing You?''         Ms. Hebert, who never married, often said she would have liked to have had children but could not reconcile the demands of writing with the demands of motherhood.       
         Bonnie Cashin, one of the first designers to create and popularize that uniquely American approach to dress called sportswear, died Thursday after open heart surgery at New York University Medical Center. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Cashin was one of a handful of women in the 1940's and 1950's who made an important contribution to American fashion, at a time when Parisian couturiers dominated the runways and supplied most of the original fashions for manufacturers to copy. The breakthroughs achieved by Ms. Cashin and designers like Claire McCardell, Vera Maxwell, Anne Klein and Anne Fogarty still influence the way women dress, and paved the way for the success of American designers like Ralph Lauren, Donna Karan and Calvin Klein.         Renowned for her loose-fitting sportswear, Ms. Cashin described her unstudied, casual designs as ''articulating with the body.'' She was an early proponent of layering -- using several layers of light, fluid clothes, rather than one heavy garment. She pioneered the use of grommets in place of buttons and was the first important designer to make ponchos for women, introducing lightweight capes and ponchos that, she explained, ''didn't look like a horse should wear them.''         As far back as 1943, she showed boots with tweed suits and included them in almost every subsequent collection. Her ''pocketbook'' pocket, with a snap closing, was another feature that long distinguished Cashin designs. She was ahead of her time when she introduced canvas raincoats in 1952, industrial zippers in 1955, jumpsuits in 1956 and suede Indian dresses with fringes in 1957.         She opened her own business, Bonnie Cashin Designs, in 1952 and for the two ensuing decades also designed leather, jersey, canvas and tweed clothes for Philip Sills. In addition, she created handbags for Coach Leatherware, gloves for Crescendoe-Superb and rainwear for Modelia. In the early 1970's, she branched out into knitwear with styles knitted to shape, rather than cut and sewn, and with welt hems instead of traditional hems or ribbed cuffs. A popular innovation was a roomy turtleneck that did not require a zipper to get over the head.         Although her themes were often adopted by other designers, Cashin clothes had a look of their own. Her tweed ponchos were bound in leather, and her coats had a special, supple swing. For several years, there were Cashin departments in chic Paris and London stores.         ''Women buy Cashin clothes because they are cozy and comfortable, not because they bowl people over,'' the fashion writer Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times in 1968.         Her gloves had many of the same features as her clothes. Grommets were arranged in the back of one style so that the glove could almost have served as a set of brass knuckles. Brass toggles not only were ornamental but also held a pair of gloves together or attached them to a belt. Some had drawstrings at the top that could be tightened to keep out the wind.         Her classic designs for Coach in the early 1960's were the shoulder bag and what was called the Basic, a smaller clutch style with a removable shoulder strap. The first bag she designed, a leather carryall modeled after paper shopping bags, was later discontinued but has since become ubiquitous in the collections of numerous handbag companies.         She was intolerant of anything ugly, in appearance or design. When she traveled, she draped lengths of Thai silk in her hotel rooms and ordered quantities of flowers. She was also generous on the road, dispensing items in her wardrobe to anyone who admired them. She usually returned with a different wardrobe from the one she had packed, not only because she had given away her clothing but also because she was interested in acquiring fashion ideas from other countries.         ''Travel is my education,'' she said in a 1961 interview with Charlotte Curtis in The Times. ''Even if I don't use an idea right away, it's there.'' The idea of layering came from time she spent in Asia. ''The Japanese refer to cold weather as a nine-layer day,'' she explained in 1950. ''Hot is a one-layer day.''         One of her best-known innovations was the ''dog leash'' skirt, which came about because she was constantly holding her skirt going up steps in her country home in Briarcliff, N.Y. The long wool skirt could be instantly shortened by latching a small brass ring sewn near the bottom to a small brass clasp at the waistline.         Ms. Cashin was born on Sept. 28, 1915, in Oakland, Calif., the daughter of Carl Cashin, a photographer and inventor, and Eunice Cashin. The family lived in several towns in northern California during Ms. Cashin's early years, and in each her mother would open a custom dress shop. As a child she was given fabric scraps as playthings and soon began sewing and designing.         Shortly before her graduation from high school, she showed some of her sketches to the director of a Los Angeles ballet company and was hired to make costumes for the next performance. After graduation, she joined the company as its designer and in 1934 accompanied the manager to New York when he took over the Roxy Theater. Not yet 20, she created three costume changes a week for each of the variety theater's 24 dancers.         She often called her Roxy experience her ''formal schooling in design'' and credited it with her later ability to create clothes that looked good on figures in motion. The theater also propelled her into designing street clothes, initially a collection of sportswear for Adler & Adler, a manufacturing concern.         After the United States entered World War II, she was appointed to a committee to design uniforms for women in the armed forces. But the war also imposed restrictions on the civilian use of fabrics and trim. She returned to costume design, which had more leeway with fabrics, and moved to Hollywood. There, she joined 20th Century Fox and created the clothes for some 60 films, including ''A Tree Grows in Brooklyn,'' ''Laura'' and ''Anna and the King of Siam.''         Ms. Cashin enjoyed the work in Hollywood, explaining: ''I wasn't designing for fashion, but for characteristics, which is the way I like to design clothes for daily wear. I like to design clothes for a woman who plays a particular role in life, not simply to design clothes that follow a certain trend, or that express some new silhouette.''         She remained in Hollywood until 1949, when she returned to New York. Her casual, layered clothes struck a responsive chord in American women. Within three years, she had won the first of her Coty Awards and organized Bonnie Cashin Designs.         Ms. Cashin was also chosen the first designer for Patterns of The Times, American Designer Series, a monthly feature in The New York Times during the 1950's that made designer patterns available for home sewing.         She was inducted into the Coty American Fashion Critics Hall of Fame in 1972 after receiving her second Coty Award in 1968. Her designs are in more than a dozen museums and some 30 university collections.         She was among the designers highlighted in the 1998 Metropolitan Museum of Art Costume Institute exhibition ''American Ingenuity: Sportswear 1930's-1970's.'' A retrospective of her work is scheduled to open in September at the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York.         In 1979, she established the Innovative Design Fund awards, a nonprofit organization based in New York that gave up to $10,000 to designers with original ideas in home furnishings, textiles and fashion so they could transform their sketches into marketable products.         During her early design years, she was married briefly to Robert Sterner, an art director. They were later divorced. She is survived by her longtime companion, Curtis Kellar.         Bernadine Morris summed up Ms. Cashin's fashion philosophy and appeal in a 1968 article in The Times: ''In a day when most fashions seem stamped out by cookie cutters, hers look as if they had been touched with human hands.''         ''They have an uncompromising integrity, freedom and joy,'' Mrs. Morris wrote.         Her own career philosophy was summed up in a framed unsigned cartoon of trapeze performers she had hanging in her Manhattan apartment. One high-wire performer is advising the other, ''You've got to know when to let go.''       
         Margaret Rosezarian Harris, a musician and educator who was the first black woman to conduct the  symphony orchestras of Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, St. Louis, Minnesota and 11 other American cities, died on March 7 in New York City. She was 56 and lived in Elmsford, N.Y.         The cause was a heart attack, said Sandra G. Owen, a friend.         Ms. Harris was born in Chicago on Sept. 15, 1943, the only child of Dewey and Clara Townsend Harris. Before her fourth birthday, she played a public piano recital of 18 short pieces and three encores, all performed from memory. She was soon performing in halls as far from home as the War Memorial Opera House in San Francisco, earning as much as $2,000 a performance.         When she was 6, her parents ended the tours and placed her in school. At 10 she performed with the Chicago Symphony and won a scholarship to the Curtis Institute in Philadelphia.  Ms. Harris's mother moved with her to Philadelphia, working there as a dressmaker. Her father, a Pennsylvania Railroad mechanic, remained in Chicago, visiting his wife and daughter regularly until his death in 1967.         Ms. Harris later earned bachelor's and master's degrees from the Juilliard School. Her graduate work was supported by a grant from the Leopold Schepp Foundation. Ms. Harris would later become a trustee of the foundation.         Though piano was her first love and she played solo recitals in the United States and abroad, Ms. Harris gained the most prominence as a conductor. She worked on Broadway as well, notably as music director of the musical ''Hair,'' a position she took over in 1970. Her orchestra was made up of seven male musicians, all older than she.         ''They don't give me a bit of trouble personally or professionally,'' Ms. Harris was quoted as saying in a New York Times article about this pioneering engagement for a black woman. She added, ''It's like having an unlimited charge account at Saks Fifth Avenue.''         In 1995, she was invited by the United States Information Service of the United States Embassy in Tashkent, Uzbekistan, to serve as an American cultural specialist for a production there of ''Porgy and Bess.''         Among her compositions are two ballets, an opera called ''King David'' and two piano concertos, the second of which was performed twice with the Los Angeles Philharmonic, conducted by Zubin Mehta.         Last month Ms. Harris was appointed associate dean of the Pennsylvania Academy of Music in Lancaster, a position she was scheduled to assume in June.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Jean Howard, who rode the comet of her extraordinary beauty, ethereal glamour and insouciant intelligence to become a Ziegfeld girl, a Hollywood starlet, a legendary hostess and the house photographer of the film colony, died at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Monday. She was 89.         Ms. Howard's circle included Tyrone Power, Vivien Leigh, Laurence Olivier, Humphrey Bogart, Lauren Bacall, Jennifer Jones, Merle Oberon, Gary Cooper, Marlene Dietrich, Greta Garbo, Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe -- impressive company for the daughter of a traveling salesman. She thrived in a seemingly ancient time when stars socialized for purposes other than publicity, including simply enjoying each other's company.         They played croquet in matches that lasted years (with timeouts for rest, refreshment and the occasional movie), played on California beaches and hung out in Palm Beach, Palm Springs and the south of France. They also mingled at Ms. Howard's Spanish-style home on Coldwater Canyon Drive in Beverly Hills; she and her first husband, Charles K. Feldman, who used his success as the first super-agent to become a producer, bought it for $18,000 in 1942.         Everywhere, Ms. Howard snapped pictures. One shows Gene Tierney, then a top star at 20th Century Fox, in pigtails, looking longingly into the handsome face of the mysterious millionaire Howard Hughes. Another shows a tipsy Richard Burton kissing everyone in sight, including a less-than-charmed Clifton Webb.         Still another shows Dietrich almost touching heads with Ann Warner, wife of Jack, the studio head, as they intensely discussed never-to-be-known secrets over a smoky table at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Linda Christian can be seen being fitted for her wedding gown to marry Tyrone Power.         Many of these photographs were stored in shoe boxes. Meanwhile, Ms. Howard studied photography and began to get assignments taking pictures for magazines like Life and Vogue. Years later, the idea coalesced to combine her snapshots and professional work in a picture book.         In 1989, Harry N. Abrams published ''Jean Howard's Hollywood: A Photo Memoir.'' James Watters wrote the text, which is delivered through Ms. Howard's first-person voice. The book evokes a lost world where stars lived lives that were breathtakingly glamorous, but still somehow life-sized.         In the pictures, everyone, it seems, is smoking. Everyone is holding a drink, everyone is dressed in black tie or cocktail dress. People gather around the piano and sing. Conga lines end up in swimming pools.         ''These photographs bring back memories of a time and a place that have long since faded,'' Ms. Howard wrote in the book's introduction. ''Hollywood has changed and things don't happen as they once did. Never mind. The people who crowd these pages are clear as snowcapped mountains on a bright sunny day.''         Ms. Howard was born Ernestine Hill in Longview, Tex., and grew up in Dallas. She became acquainted with a local photographer, who had discovered several child stars, including Ginger Rogers, and believed she had a bright future. So she changed her last name to that of the photographer, Mahoney, even though her father continued to foot the bills for her fashion shows and beauty contests.         Her father took her to Hollywood one summer in the late 1920's. ''I was his coverup while he was on a two-week toot with a girlfriend behind my stepmother's back,'' she said in the book.         She soon returned to Hollywood and checked into the all-girl Studio Club, founded by Mary Pickford to help young hopefuls working toward movie careers. In 1930 she landed a contract with Metro Goldwyn Mayer, appearing first as a chorus girl in ''Whoopee,'' Eddie Cantor's Broadway musical hit.         Florenz Ziegfeld, who had produced the Broadway show and was a partner in the film, asked her and three other showgirls to go to New York for his next musical, ''Smiles.'' Ziegfeld cast her under the name Jean Howard, which he deemed less cumbersome than Ernestine Mahoney. She got a part in the last ''Ziegfeld Follies,'' where one review cited her ''pulchritude, figure and charm.''         As an MGM contract player she had small roles in a number of movies in the 1930's and 1940's, including ''Broadway to Hollywood'' and ''The Prizefighter and the Lady.'' The studio chief Louis B. Mayer, passionately attracted to her, proposed marriage and promised to divorce his wife. She said later that when she rejected him he got drunk and tried to throw himself out of a window.         She became engaged to Feldman, a lawyer and film agent, who is credited with being the first to sell director, actors and other talent as a single package. According to The New York Times of Aug. 26, 1934, the two had attended a Friday night dinner party at the Colony restaurant in New York and decided to get married immediately.         Mayer's jealous threat to torpedo Feldman's career did not materialize, and the agent went on to play an increasingly prominent role in Hollywood, eventually producing ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' in 1951, among other films.         The couple had a famously tempestuous relationship, which resulted in a divorce in 1948. But they continued living in the same house, with its tortoise shell pedestals and Chinese porcelain lamps and a garden room where Judy Garland belted out songs on many occasions. They called it their ''can't live with you, can't live without you postmarital relationship.''         In a 1989 interview with The San Diego Union-Tribune, Ms. Howard said she ''wanted to be the other woman in his life.''         Ms. Howard traveled extensively, often with her friend Cole Porter. That resulted in another picture book, ''Travels With Cole Porter,'' published in 1991.         In 1964, she felt seasick on a Mediterranean cruise and got off the yacht in Capri. She went to a nightclub called Number Two, where a band called the Shakers was playing. She asked a band member, Tony Santoro, if he would play a song she had written. He did, though not necessarily because of its quality.         ''I was more interested in this beautiful woman than the music,'' he said in a telephone interview. They lived together for nine years, mainly in Capri and Rome, and were married in 1973. He is her only immediate survivor.         Ms. Howard once said that ''glamour is flimsy.'' She knew the stars as people, including one of her favorite subjects, Marilyn Monroe. ''She didn't know who she was or who she belonged to,'' Ms. Howard told the San Diego paper. ''The marriages never gave her anything to go on. There was the ballplayer (Joe DiMaggio) and Arthur Miller.         ''Miller was a very good writer and all of that, but I have never seen him in anybody's living room, and I have been in a few living rooms.''         Then there was the party she gave for Senator John F. Kennedy during the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, at which he won his party's nomination. After everyone had left and she was cleaning up, she heard someone scratching at the window screen, according to a 1993 article in Town & Country.         She looked out and saw Kennedy, who said, ''I'm starving and nothing's open at this hour.'' She led him to the kitchen and fed him scrambled eggs. She said the senator then pulled her to him and kissed her. She told the magazine that people would have to read her autobiography to find out what happened.         But she never published one.       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Sandra Schmirler, the star of the first women's curling team to win an Olympic gold medal and one of Canada's most popular athletes, died Thursday in Regina, Saskatchewan. She was 36.         She died of cancer, the Canadian Curling Association said.         Known as Schmirler the Curler, Schmirler starred in a sport that is one of Canada's passions, especially with families in the western provinces. One newspaper called her the public face of a Canadian sport.         ''When you played her, you were in awe,'' Colleen Jones, a two-time Canadian champion, told The Globe and Mail of Toronto. ''You knew she was better. You knew she was going to beat you. It was like playing against Gretzky.''         All curlers, men and women, recognized her focus and skill.         ''She is one of the best players, probably the best player ever,'' said Russ Howard of New Brunswick. ''She raised the level of curling. It's unbelievable what she did.''         Curlers slide round granite stones down a 146-foot-long, 15-foot-7 1/2-inch-wide sheet of ice into a 12-foot circle known as the house, while two sweepers with straw or synthetic brooms help steer the stone.         Schmirler, who was born in Biggar, Saskatchewan, on June 11, 1963, was introduced to curling when she was 12. By high school, she had won provincial prep titles in curling while also starring in badminton and volleyball.         After graduating from the University of Regina, Schmirler was asked to join a local team. Later, she joined forces with Jan Betker, Joan McCusker and Marcia Gudereit, forming a foursome of friends, working mothers and Olympic gold medalists.         The Caledonian Curling Club, with Schmirler as the skip, or captain, won the provincial title its first season together, 1990-91. The women then won the Canadian and world titles in 1993, 1994 and 1997.         Schmirler was six months pregnant when she won the world title in 1996 and was on maternity leave from her job with a recreation center when the team went to the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan.         ''When you have success and you're having fun, it just snowballs and gets bigger and bigger,'' Schmirler said of the team's success.         Schmirler's group won the 1998 gold medal by defeating Denmark in Nagano, the first Olympics to make curling an official medal sport. The first athletes from Regina to win an Olympic gold medal became national heroines.         Carol Anne Letheren, chief executive officer of the Canadian Olympic Association, said Schmirler ''was a Canadian with whom other Canadians could identify.''         Schmirler's team was voted the Canadian Press team of the year for 1998, and she was inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame last March.         Shortly after Schmirler gave birth to her second child last summer, following a difficult pregnancy, doctors discovered a malignant tumor in her chest cavity. During surgery last September to remove blood clots, she nearly died on the operating table.         Doctors were not able to pinpoint the source of the cancer as she underwent chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other forms of alternative treatment.         All the while, the country rallied to support her and help pay for her medical expenses.         ''I didn't think I was that good until I started reading all the cards and letters and faxes and e-mails,'' said Schmirler, who died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital's Palliative Care Unit.         ''All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler,'' Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada said in a statement. ''Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life.''         She is survived by her husband, Shannon England; their daughters, Sara and Jenna; her mother, Shirley; and two sisters, Carol and Beverley.         Flags at all provincial office buildings in Saskatchewan were lowered to half-staff.       
         Beatrice Schenk de Regniers, an author whose ability to recreate the sensibilities of a child informed many well-loved books she wrote for young readers, died on March 1 at her home in Washington. She was 86.         Beni Montresor illustrated Mrs. de Regniers's ''May I Bring a Friend?'' (1972) and won the Caldecott Medal for the pictures that accompany the story of a boy who politely asks a king and queen for permission before bringing his animal friends along when he is asked to visit. Mrs. de Regniers's other books included ''A Little House of Your Own'' (1954), illustrated by Irene Haas, and ''Little Sister and the Month Brothers'' (1975), illustrated by Margot Tomes.         ''What Can You Do With a Shoe?,'' an engaging conversation between two children, was illustrated by Maurice Sendak in 1955 using two colors. It was republished in 1997 with full-color illustrations by Mr. Sendak.         Mrs. de Regniers was born in Lafayette, Ind., and raised in nearby Crawfordsville, a place where, she wrote, a child could ''gather violets, live in a tree, walk in the woods -- be.'' She earned degrees from the University of Chicago and the Winnetka Graduate Teachers College.         She was a social worker and a dancer and during World War II a welfare officer with the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. For 11 years she was director of educational materials for the American Heart Association before becoming the founding editor of Scholastic's Lucky Book Club in 1961. She retired from that position in 1981.         In an essay Mrs. de Regniers explained the deceptively simple style of her children's books, saying that ''a book for young people that honestly has its roots in the author's feelings as a child is not likely to seem old-fashioned or out of date.''         Under the pseudonym Tamara Kitt (Tammy and Mara were her cats' names), Mrs. de Regniers also wrote a series of mass-market paperbacks, including ''Jake'' and ''Sam and the Impossible Thing.''         She was married to Francis de Regniers, who worked as a manager  for Air France, and they lived in New York until his death in 1992. She later moved to Washington to be near her sister, Lillian Goldman of Washington, who survives her.         When schoolchildren asked if she had children of her own, Mrs. de Regniers explained that she had vivid memories of her childhood. ''I remember 'way back,'' she would say, ''even before I was 2 years old,'' adding that ''almost everything I write relates in some way to these early years. What was important to me then is important to me now.         ''That is why, even though I have no children of my own, I think it is O.K. for me to write books that children will read or have read to them.''       
         Lila Kedrova, the Russian-born actress whose portrayals of an aging French prostitute in screen and stage versions of ''Zorba the Greek'' won her an Academy Award and a Tony, died on Feb. 16 in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. She was believed to be around 82.         Her death was announced in The Sault Star on Feb. 17 but was not reported by news agencies.         Although she appeared in scores of films and plays in England, Canada and on the Continent that won her accolades ranging from a French Cesar for the film ''Razzia sur la Chnouf'' (1955), the Evening Standard Award in London for her stage role in ''The Cherry Orchard'' in 1969, a Genie Award (Canada's equivalent of the Oscar) for ''Eliza's Horoscope'' (1970) and a Golden Mask at Taormina in Sicily for the film ''Tell Me a Riddle'' (1980), Ms. Kedrova was best known her for portrayal of Madame Hortense in ''Zorba.''         In the film and Broadway musical adaptations of the 1946 Nikos Kazantzakis novel ''Zorba, the Greek,'' which starred Anthony Quinn, Miss Kedrova won raves as the earthy Zorba's aging, dying mistress.         ''The old woman of Lila Kedrova is brilliantly realized, a wrinkled and tacky relic of a once successful coquette, still hopeful, audacious and courageous,'' Bosley Crowther wrote in his review of the 1964 film in The New York Times.         When she recreated her role on Broadway in 1983, Frank Rich of The Times described Ms. Kedrova's Madame Hortense as ''a small, round, smeary-faced woman out of a Toulouse-Lautrec canvas'' who could bat ''her big, Betty Boop eyes with a schoolgirl's blushing flirtatiousness.''         He said: ''Miss Kedrova may indeed be of a certain age, but we see the young 'cabaret star' she claims to have once been; we also see that the old Hortense is remembering the young Hortense just as we do. No wonder Miss Kedrova shimmers, and no wonder our eyes mist over.''         The role that won Miss Kedrova her Oscar as best supporting actress and her Tony for best featured actress in a musical was first offered by the film's Greek director, Michael Cacoyannis, to Simone Signoret.         But, Miss Kedrova said, after two days on location in Crete, Miss Signoret withdrew, and Mr. Cacoyannis telephoned Ms. Kedrova in Paris to invite her to join his cast.         ''I accepted, but in fact my feelings were ambivalent,'' she told The Times of London some years ago. ''It was a fascinating role, but not perhaps for me. What had I in common with this vulgarian, this whore, 20 years older than myself? Then I thought I must try to understand her heart, enter completely into her mentality and find what is most real and sincere in myself. I found I could do this, but I was quite amazed, quite unprepared to win the Academy Award.''         There was one other problem, Miss Kedrova told Nora Ephron in a profile in The New York Post in 1965. When Mr. Cacoyannis called, he asked if Miss Kedrova spoke English.         ''He asked me the question in French,'' she said. ''And I replied, 'Oui.' It was the biggest lie in my life.''         But remembering the lyrics to a few American songs she had sung and expressions like ''How do you do?'' and ''Thank you,'' she got the part.         Miss Kedrova, who was born in Leningrad into the Kedroffs, a distinguished and well-to-do musical family, fled the aftermath of the Russian Revolution with them and became an emigree in Paris.         A restless child, she was a frequent truant and runaway. ''Once I joined the Gypsies; another time I took a job in a circus pulling a bear on a chain,'' she told The Times of London. ''When I was 12, I fell in love with the theater and knew then what I wanted to do. And though my parents had planned a musical career for me, they allowed me to join a troupe of Russian actors, resident in Paris, who played according to the Stanislavsky method. I was with them for three years.         ''In those days I acted with complete spontaneity, lived my parts almost instinctively, and it was some time before I realized that any talent, however bright, needs guarding and guiding.''         So she studied drama with the actor-director Pierre Valde, who became her first husband.         In the early 1950's she began to achieve critical and popular success onstage in France, where she starred in productions like ''The Rose Tattoo,'' ''A View From the Bridge,'' ''A Taste of Honey'' and ''The Brothers Karamazov.''         Her second husband, Richard Howard, a director whom she married in 1969, said that Miss Kedrova, who had no other immediate survivors, made her last stage appearance in the early 1990's at the Chichester Festival and her last film in 1993. The couple maintained homes in Toronto and Paris as well as Sault Ste. Marie.         Some reference books listed Miss Kedrova's year of birth as 1918, and Mr. Howard pointed out that other, later dates were to be found elsewhere. He said that when her family fled Russia, they left their papers behind. And the false papers they were given in France were confiscated by the Nazis.         ''She liked it that way,'' Mr. Howard said of her agelessness. ''I remember her telling me that it was wonderful because she could choose to be any age she wanted to be, and that she wanted to be 16.''       
         Sister Mary Geraldine Tobia, a longtime co-director of the Center for Family Life in Sunset Park, a social service agency serving people in that section of Brooklyn, died on Tuesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 59 and lived at the center, which is at 345 43rd Street in Sunset Park.         The cause was cancer, said Jennifer Howse, a friend who headed the center's advisory board for the last 10 years.         Sister Mary Geraldine, who was a Sister of the Good Shepherd, and Sister Mary Paul Janchill were the co-founders of the center in 1978.         It provides comprehensive neighborhood services to children, young people and families in Sunset Park, a generally poor, largely immigrant neighborhood. Most of the people who live there are Hispanic, and part of the neighborhood has been mostly peopled by Chinese immigrants over the last seven or eight years.         In an interview in 1993, Sister Mary Geraldine said, ''We are more like the old settlement house than we are anything else.''         By that time the center's services, besides family counseling, had come to include child care, a food bank, job placement, a sports league, centers for teenagers, even a thrift shop.         ''She treated everybody she worked with as a family member, and that became the model for the Center for Family Life, and in fact became a model for similar institutions across the country,'' said David Saltzman, executive director of the Robin Hood Foundation, which fights poverty in New York City and worked with Sister Mary Geraldine for the last 12 years.         Bishop Joseph M. Sullivan, auxiliary Roman Catholic bishop of Brooklyn for human services, said Sister Mary Geraldine ''was a woman of extraordinary energy and very upbeat mentality and believed in hands-on dealing with community problems and issues.''         He added: ''''She believed most of the solutions should be fashioned within the communities where the kids lived. There was never a day that I recall, in observing her, where she was down. She always thought there was a solution to every problem, there was a way of dealing with reality that could really turn the thing around.''         From the time of the center's founding until Sister Mary Geraldine's death, she and Sister Mary Paul were its co-directors, with equal authority in administering it.         Sister Mary Geraldine was the center's project director, in charge of its afterschool and evening programs for children, in two elementary schools and a middle school in Sunset Park.         Sister Mary Geraldine also supervised many of the center's other operations and its administrative and maintenance staffs.         For her part, Sister Mary Paul has been the center's clinical director, overseeing clinical social workers in their work within the neighborhood.         Despite Sister Mary Geraldine's death, the center's various operations are to be continued as they have been for 22 years. Its financing comes from government sources and from private charitable organizations like the Robin Hood Foundation.         The honors she received include an Ecumenical Woman of the Year award in 1978 from the Brooklyn Division of the Council of Churches of the City of New York and a Robin Hood Foundation Heroes Award in 1991.         Sister Mary Geraldine was born and raised in Newark, and received a bachelor's degree, magna cum laude, in 1967 from Fordham, a master's degree in 1976 from the family and community relations department of Teachers College at Columbia, and a master's degree in 1985 from Columbia's School of Social Work.         Surviving are her mother, Bridget Cappozzi Tobia of Newark, and numerous cousins.       
         Claire Trevor, an Academy Award-winning actress who epitomized cynical but warm-hearted careerists -- reporters, gun molls, saloon entertainers and trollops -- died Saturday at a hospital near her home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 91 and had suffered from respiratory ailments in recent months, said Richard Elbaum, a spokesman for the family.         A Brooklyn native who became enamored of stage acting and found her way into the movies during Hollywood's golden age, Miss Trevor appeared in nearly 70 films, working under legendary directors like John Huston and John Ford and playing alongside such famous leading men as John Wayne and Humphrey Bogart.         She played the former girlfriend of a gangster (Humphrey Bogart) who becomes a burned-out streetwalker in ''Dead End'' (1937) and a freewheeling woman forced out of town by bluenoses in the classic version of ''Stagecoach'' (1939). She was the alcoholic mistress of a mobster played by Edward G. Robinson in ''Key Largo'' (1948) and a spunky jet passenger in ''The High and the Mighty'' (1954).         She may be best remembered for ''Key Largo,'' for which she won the Oscar for best supporting actress playing the part of Gaye Dawn, a has-been cabaret singer who, in one emotionally charged scene, is forced by her sadistic lover to sing ''Moanin' Low'' in return for a drink. Feebly, she manages to sob through the song, but Mr. Robinson's character denies her because, he says, her singing was ''rotten.''         Miss Trevor also received Academy Award nominations for ''The High and the Mighty'' and ''Dead End.''         The blond, smoky-voiced Miss Trevor was a dedicated performer who repeatedly breathed fresh life into her films, many of which sorely needed her grace and gumption. Early on she became a ''queen of the B's,'' the low-budget action movies that rounded off double bills. But she got plenty of ''A'' roles, making the most of them.         In other key roles, she was a faithless lover in ''The Amazing Dr. Clitterhouse'' (1938), a conspiratorial killer in ''Murder, My Sweet'' (1945), a vitriolic Broadway actress in ''The Velvet Touch'' (1948), an overprotective mother in ''Marjorie Morningstar'' (1958) and a scornful shrew in two melodramas, ''Two Weeks in Another Town'' (1962) and ''How to Murder Your Wife'' (1965).         The modest Miss Trevor was one of the few actresses whose seemingly effortless talent made most viewers take her for granted, while film buffs cherished her. Looking back, she concluded that she never became a top star because she lacked the drive that energizes them. ''I didn't know,'' she said, ''that to make a real career in Hollywood you have to become a 'personality,' have to cultivate publicity departments and become known as 'The Ear' or even 'The Toe.' ''         On television, she won an Emmy award in an acclaimed 1956 revival of ''Dodsworth,'' with Fredric March in the title role. She artfully portrayed his vain wife, who consorts with shallow lovers in a futile battle against age. Miss Trevor said she enjoyed working for television because it provided her with a wider, more sympathetic range of roles. But she said she never wanted to sacrifice personal happiness for her career. ''As for a TV series, never,'' she said, ''Life's too short and, frankly, I'm not terribly ambitious.''         Claire Trevor was born Claire Wemlinger on March 8, 1909, in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, the only child of Noel and Betty Wemlinger. (Mr. Elbaum said Miss Trevor's stepson, Donald Bren, said she was born in 1910; many reference works list her birth in 1909.) Her father was a Fifth Avenue merchant tailor who soon moved the family to Larchmont in Westchester County. After her graduation from high school, Miss Trevor took art courses for six months at Columbia University before studying for six more months at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She began honing her craft in repertory theater in Michigan, St. Louis and Long Island and through shorts filmed in Brooklyn.         These appearances led to starring roles in two Broadway plays, ''Whistling in the Dark,'' a hit, and ''The Party's Over,'' a flop. The Fox movie company had noticed her, however, and offered a five-year contract. Although she wanted to stay in the theater, she had no immediate stage prospects and accepted Fox's offer, arriving in Hollywood in 1933.         She then made 14 Fox quickies over four years. Most were action-adventure pictures dominated by the leading men, but she won wide praise for playing several hard-bitten newspaper reporters. ''I worked like a demon, and I knew it was a job,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1995. ''Saturday night, you never could plan on going out to dinner because we'd break for dinner for one hour and work till 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 in the morning.''         Spencer Tracy was the early co-star she admired most, and she said she quickly began imitating ''the clever way he throws away a line.'' Another favorite leading man was Mr. Robinson, with whom she appeared in ''Big Town,'' a popular radio series, from 1937 to 1940. He played Steve Wilson, editor of the mythical Illustrated Press, and she was Lorelei Kilbourne, his ace reporter and foil.         Her longtime wish to return to Broadway materialized in 1947, when she and Philip Dorn co-starred in a comedy, ''The Big Two.'' The consensus of critics was that they gave the play much more artistry and vitality than it deserved. It closed after 21 performances.         Her private life was far different from the lives of the sassy characters she played. She was married to Clark Andrews, director of her radio show, from 1938 to 1942, when they divorced. In 1943 she married Cylos Dunsmoore, a Navy lieutenant. The marriage produced a son, Charles, but ended in divorce in 1947.         Her third marriage, to Milton Bren, a film producer, lasted from 1948 until his death in 1979 of a brain tumor. Mr. Bren had two sons from a previous marriage, later prompting Miss Trevor to recall fondly that they had ''an instant family.'' In 1978 Miss Trevor lost her son, Charles, in an airliner disaster.         The losses of her son and husband in the span of a year left her devastated, and she moved to New York, settling into a Fifth Avenue apartment and embarking on a busy social schedule. She also occasionally returned to acting, in her last role playing an aging schoolteacher in the 1987 television movie ''Norman Rockwell's Breaking Home Ties.''         Miss Trevor would later return to California, where she was also known as a generous philanthropist.         She is survived by her stepsons, Donald Bren, chairman of the Irvine Company, a real estate investment firm in Newport Beach, and Peter Bren, president of Koll-Bren-Schreiber, a real estate investment firm in New York.       
         Helen Ratnoff Plotz, who earned praise for compiling and editing almost a score of anthologies of poetry, mostly for young adults, died March 30 at her home in Brooklyn. She was 87.         In a review of the anthology ''The Gift Outright: America and Her Poets'' (1977), Deborah Churchman wrote in The Christian Science Monitor that Mrs. Plotz was ''an outstanding collector of poems'' who included admirers and detractors in her compilation.         Mrs. Plotz also compiled ''Untune the Sky: Poems of Music and the Dance'' (1957).         Her 1981 anthology, ''Gladly Learn and Teach: Poems of the School Experience,'' was selected as an Ambassador of Honor Book by English-Speaking Union Books-Across-the-Sea. Her last anthology was ''A Week of Lullabies'' (1988).         She was a member of the Children's Books Committee of the Child Study Association and of the Committee on Childhood Education of the Public Education Association.         A native of Brooklyn, she graduated from Girls Commercial High School (now Prospect Heights High) and from Vassar College.         She married Dr. Milton Plotz in 1933. He died in 1962.         Surviving are two daughters, Elizabeth Wagman of Brooklyn and Sarah Jacobs of London; two sons, Paul, of Washington, and John, of Berkeley, Calif.; seven grandchildren; two great-grandchildren and a brother, Dr. Oscar Ratnoff of Cleveland.       
         Vicki Sue Robinson, the vivacious pop-gospel singer whose 1976 hit ''Turn the Beat Around'' became a signature anthem of the disco era, died on Thursday at her home in Wilton, Conn. She was 46.         The cause was cancer, said Gina Andriolo, her publicist.         A prolific jingle singer whose 1999 Off Broadway show, ''Vicki Sue Robinson: Behind the Beat,'' had a successful limited engagement at the Kaufman Theater, Ms. Robinson was a powerful, exuberant belter whose dance-oriented records were among the best sung and least gimmicky disco records of late 70's.         In her autobiographical show, a gaudy theatrical extension of her popular, long-running cabaret act, she showed her range as an all-around entertainer. As both a singer and songwriter, Ms. Robinson, who described herself as a latchkey child with a bohemian upbringing, exemplified the New York musical melting pot in the late 1960's and 70's with its colliding echoes of pop, rock, gospel and Broadway.         Ms. Robinson was born in Harlem to a black actor and a white radical  folk singer. She made her singing debut at the Philadelphia Folk Festival when she was 6. Her early influences were folk and blues legends like Pete Seeger, Woody Guthrie and Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee, all friends of her mother. But she was also influenced by jazz singers like Dinah Washington and Sarah Vaughan, and later by Laura Nyro. While still a teenager, she appeared on Broadway in the musicals ''Hair'' and ''Jesus Christ Superstar.''         She is survived by her husband, Bill Good, and her mother, Marian Robinson.         Signed by RCA Records in the mid-1970's, she made four albums and  was nominated for a Grammy for best pop female vocalist. More recently, a single, ''House of Joy,'' became a major dance hit in Britain.         Her show ''Behind the Beat'' was an uninhibited, sometimes campy cabaret extravaganza that blended pop-soul oldies, personal confessions, inspirational ballads and audience singalongs, and included versions of some of her best-known jingles pitching everything from fabric softener to the New York Telephone Company  (''We're all connected'').       
         Penelope Fitzgerald, who began a prize-winning literary career late in life with a series of understated novels written in lilting prose, died on Friday in Highgate, London. She was 83 and lived in London.         Ms. Fitzgerald was the author of the 1995 novel ''The Blue Flower'' about the German poet Novalis and his hapless love for a 12-year-old girl. The book won the National Book Critics Circle Award in 1998, defeating works by authors Philip Roth and Don DeLillo.         The writer A. S. Byatt once called Ms. Fitzgerald ''Jane Austen's nearest heir, for precision and invention.'' Ms. Fitzgerald published her first novel, a mystery, ''The Golden Child,'' in 1977, when she was 60. The book was written to entertain her dying husband, Desmond Fitzgerald. But despite her late start, Ms. Fitzgerald wrote 13 books, including biographies. They were leavened with a forgiving humor and gentle flashes of illumination. She won England's  Booker Prize for ''Offshore'' in 1979.         Her books were short, usually around 200 pages, and comprised of brief, pointed scenes. For her early books, she drew on her own life. There was her experience working in a bookshop and living in an abandoned warehouse in Suffolk, recounted in ''The Bookshop'' in 1978. That novel was short-listed for the Booker Prize. Then came her story of trying to survive as a young mother on a houseboat on the Thames in ''Offshore.'' In ''Human Voices'' (1980) she used material from her job at the BBC during World War II. ''At Freddie's,'' 1982, was based on her job teaching child actors.         Ms. Fitzgerald's characters were people fallen into difficult circumstances, struggling to cope. She once called them ''exterminatees,'' which she defined as ''likely to be stamped out with other things unlikely to succeed.'' Yet there was a deep sympathy, an underlying moral vision in her work. She did not write religious books, but she once described herself as religious.         Everything in Ms. Fitzgerald's background ordained her for an intellectual career, and yet for much of her adult life she was beleaguered, coping with a husband who drank and had difficulty keeping a job, and raising three children. She was born in 1916. Both her grandfathers were Anglican bishops. Her father, Edmund Valpy Knox, was the editor of Punch. One uncle, Ronald, was a Catholic convert, a Monsignor and a  spokesman for the church. Another uncle, Dillwyn, was a Greek scholar and cryptographer who helped break German codes in World War I and II. A third uncle, Wilfred, became an Anglo-Catholic priest. It was a deeply competitive family, with Ms. Fitzgerald, her brother, Rawle, who became a foreign correspondent, and their uncles vying at the dinner table at literary games. She later wrote a biography of her father and his brothers, ''The Knox Brothers,'' published in 1977. Ms. Fitzgerald's mother, Christina, was one of the first female students at Somerville College, Oxford. Penelope was sent to boarding school at the age of 7, an experience that devastated her.  Then, when she was 18 and about to go to Somerville herself, her mother died.         At Somerville, she studied with J. R. R. Tolkien and graduated with honors in 1938. She married Desmond Fitzgerald, a major in the Irish Guards. He had been trained as a barrister, but became a travel agent.  Ms. Fitzgerald once told an interviewer that her husband ''didn't have much luck in life.'' She supplemented the family income by working at various jobs, including in the Ministry of Food. With her husband, she was editor of ''The World Review,'' a small literary journal. The family moved often and ended up living on a dilapidated houseboat in London. In 1963 it sank for the second time. ''A lot of people would have gone down, too,'' Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria told a writer for The New York Times magazine last year. ''My dad was drinking a lot then.  Somehow, my mum pulled herself together.'' The family moved to public housing and Ms. Fitzgerald became its main breadwinner. She is survived by Maria, of London; another daughter, Christina Dooley, of Cornwall; a son, Valpy Fitzgerald of Oxford, and nine grandchildren.         Ms. Fitzgerald published her first book, a biography of the Victorian artist Edward Burne-Jones, in 1975. Yet despite the difficulties of her life as a young married woman, she refused to blame the delay in her writing career on her obligations as a wife and mother. ''In all that time, I could have written books and I didn't,'' she told The Times Magazine. ''I think you can write at any time of  your life.'' She was also reticent about her marriage.         Indeed, there was a delicate, elusive quality about Ms. Fitzgerald.  She had an apologetic, modest manner that concealed an underlying strength. ''She's prepared to play the scatty old lady,'' A. S. Byatt told the Times. ''But there's a steely intelligence under that gentle scattiness.''         In her later works, Ms. Fitzgerald departed somewhat from the autobiographical mode of her earlier fiction. She wrote ''The Beginning of Spring'' (1988), set in pre-Revolutionary Russia. ''The Gate of Angels,'' was about Cambridge in 1912 and based loosely on her uncles' lives. She loved the research involved in historical fiction, she said, but found writing incurably painful.  ''I hate writing, ,'' she told Publisher's Weekly. ''You just welcome any interruption that comes.''         Her editor at HarperCollins in London, Stuart Proffitt, compared her recent books to Beethoven in his ''late period,'' he said, '''where everything is getting pared down but the content is more concentrated.''         Ms. Fitzgerald's daughter Maria said that she worked until the week she died. Her final book, ''The Means of Escape,'' a story collection, is to be published next fall by Counterpoint.         ''I have remained true to my deepest convictions,'' Ms. Fitzgerald said in 1998. ''I mean to the courage of those who are born to be defeated, the weaknesses of the strong, and the tragedy of misunderstandings and missed opportunities, which I have done my best to treat as comedy, for otherwise how can we manage to bear it?''         Correction:  May 8, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the British novelist Penelope Fitzgerald on Wednesday misidentified the publisher of ''The Means of Escape,'' her story collection due this fall. It is Houghton Mifflin, not Counterpoint.       
         Helen Beardsley, a mother of 20 who recounted the story of her unusual family in a book that was later made into a popular movie, died  April 26 at a hospital in Healdsburg, Calif. She was 70 and lived in Santa Rosa, Calif.         The cause was complications from Parkinson's disease, her family said.         In 1968, Lucille Ball and Henry Fonda starred in the film ''Yours, Mine and Ours,'' based on Mrs. Beardsley's 1964 book, ''Who Gets the Drumstick?'' (Random House), which recounted the logistical problems of raising 20 children in a modern middle-class American family.         Mrs. Beardsley's first husband, Lt. Richard Dale North, a Navy pilot, died in a fighter-jet crash in 1960, when she was six months pregnant with their eighth child. The next year, she married another naval officer, Chief Warrant Officer Francis L. Beardsley, whose wife had recently died of diabetes, leaving him with their 10 children. The 18 children ranged in age from 6 months to 15 years. By 1964, the Beardsleys had two additional children of their own.         ''I was the oldest of the North boys,'' said Nicholas North, who became a middle child. ''I had lost a father, but all of a sudden I had older brothers.''         Teresa Wyble, the youngest of the North children, said that when the families joined, it was as if she had gained a twin. ''There is only six months between my sister Joan and I, and there are several of us like that,'' Mrs. Wyble said. She said the household had at least one birthday in every month but May.         When the Beardleys were first married, they lived in a two-story, four-bedroom house in Carmel, Calif. Later, using proceeds from the book and movie, they added a floor, five bedrooms and five bathrooms.         A bread company used the children in its commercials in the 1960's and delivered 50 loaves to the Beardsleys every two weeks. The Navy commissary listed the family as a restaurant so that the Beardsleys could buy food at wholesale prices.         Helen Eileen Brandmeir was born April 5, 1930, in Seattle. She studied nursing at Seattle University. She was named Mother of the Year by the National Campfire Girls in 1963 and was a member of the California Advisory Commission on the Status of Women.         When Mr. Beardsley retired from the Navy in 1968, the couple opened three bakeries in Monterey, Calif. In 1973, Mrs. Beardsley went to work for the Carmel Community Hospital. She later worked as a cardiovascular technologist at a hospital in Fresno, Calif. The couple retired to Santa Rosa in 1986.         Mrs. Beardsley is survived by her husband; 20 children; 44 grandchildren; and 2 great-grandchildren.         Explaining once how she had managed to keep the house running smoothly, Mrs. Beardsley said, ''I think the military background helped.''       
         Dr. Harriet Lange Rheingold, a child psychologist and research professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina, died on April 29 at a retirement center in Chapel Hill, N.C. She was 92.         Dr. Rheingold did not begin her specialized research until she was 45, after 20 years of patient care and undergraduate teaching. She made a name for herself nationally in the next 20 years with her work in developmental psychology.         She focused on the social and exploratory skills of infants and young children. Her interests ranged from infant sociability and responsiveness to independent behavior and the development of valued traits like sharing, helping and caring.         Her teaching and writings helped to change the way psychologists view normal infant behavior by helping to shape the recognition that infants interact with their environment from birth. Her books included ''The Infant Separates Himself From Her Mother,'' published by the American Association for the Advancement of Science in 1970.         A native New Yorker, she graduated from Cornell University in 1928 with a degree in philosophy and earned a master's in psychology at Columbia University in 1930. She then was a research fellow, psychologist and assistant professor at Rockford College in Illinois.         In 1955 she received a Ph.D. in psychology at the University of Chicago. She was a research psychologist at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Md., before joining the North Carolina faculty as a research professor in 1964.         In 1985 she organized a symposium, ''Toward a Unified Science of Behavioral Development,'' for the Society for Research in Child Development. The same year she also addressed the 18th World Congress on Early Childhood Education in Jerusalem.         Dr. Rheingold is survived by her husband, Dr. Don W. Hayne; two sons, Paul D. Rheingold of Rye, N.Y., and Dr. Arnold L. Rheingold of Wilmington, Del.; six grandchildren, and two great-grandsons. Her first husband, Dr. Joseph D. Rheingold, a psychiatrist, died in 1978.       
         Sybil Trent, a veteran of the golden age of radio and a star of the Saturday-morning children's radio show ''Let's Pretend,'' died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         The cause was lymphoma, said her son Drew Nieporent, the restaurateur.         Ms. Trent's voice was first heard on ''Let's Pretend'' in 1935, not long after she made her Broadway debut alongside Jimmy Durante, Gloria Grafton and Donald Novis, and atop an elephant, in Billy Rose's ''Jumbo,'' with songs by Rodgers and Hart,  at the Hippodrome Theater.         Over two decades, until the final broadcast of ''Let's Pretend'' in 1954, she entertained young listeners with renditions of princesses and fairy godmothers and found fame in her startlingly realistic ''baby cry.''         A precocious child, Ms. Trent began her career at the age of 3 1/2, when she performed in a short film with Fatty Arbuckle. Soon, she was singing and dancing her way through more than 25 shorts with stars like Ruth Etting and Jack Haley as a member of the Warner Brothers stock company.         Feature films at RKO followed, including ''The People's Enemy'' (1935) with Melvyn Douglas and Lila Lee, and ''Keep 'Em Rolling'' (1934) with Walter Huston.         By the age of 6, Ms. Trent was the host of her own radio show on WHN, ''Baby Sybil Elaine and Her Kiddie Revue,'' on which she would conjure  imitations of Joe Penner and the Block and Sully comedy team before closing with a sweetly sung ''Thank You for a Lovely Evening.''         One of the 150 charter members of the American Federation of Radio Artists, Ms. Trent also took the lead on ''We Love and Learn,'' ''Stella Dallas,'' ''Aunt Jenny'' and ''David Harum,'' and performed on shows like ''The Martha Raye Show,'' ''The Ed Sullivan Show''and Joe Franklin's ''Memory Lane.''         From 1973 to 1994, she was the casting director at the Young & Rubicam advertising agency in Manhattan.         Ms. Trent continued to do vocal work on commercials and in her spare time took reservations at her son's Manhattan restaurants.         ''The woman on the phone has the most delicious voice: low, slightly husky, completely inviting,'' Ruth Reichl wrote in 1994 in The New York Times of Ms. Trent's mellifluous tones. ''Just calling for a reservation makes you eager to eat at Montrachet.''         In addition to her son Drew, she is survived by another son, Tracy, and four grandchildren, all of New Jersey.       
         Rose Wyler, who wrote more than 50 books for children on science and other topics, died on June 12 at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Ms. Wyler was the sole author of over two dozen books and a co-author of others. One of her best-known works is ''Spooky Tricks'' (1968), which she wrote with her husband Gerald Ames. When it was reissued in 1994, Scripps Howard News Service called it ''the perfect Halloween book'' for ''school-agers who are just beginning to read.''         Ms. Wyler once recalled that as a girl she ''always had a collection of stones, bugs or leaves and always wanted to know more about nature.'' She never could find books on nature as a child, she said, so at 11 she decided she was going to write them.         Her book ''Science Fun With Toy Boats and Planes'' (1986) was praised by The Christian Science Monitor, which said: ''For the young physicist, there is a wealth of information in this little book.''         A native of the Bronx, Ms. Wyler  received a B.A. from Barnard and a master's from Teacher's College at Columbia. Her first marriage ended in divorce. She married Mr. Ames in 1948. He died in 1993.         She is survived by two sons, Joseph Kosok of Vera Cruz, Mexico, and Karl Kosok of Silver Spring, Md.; a stepdaughter, Eva-Lee Baird of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.       
         Ruth Rubin, a scholar, collector and performer of Yiddish folk songs who lugged a tape recorder into hundreds of immigrants' living rooms in an effort to preserve a vanishing cultural tradition, died on Sunday in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 93.         A resident of the Sarah R. Neumann Nursing Home, she formerly lived in Manhattan.         One of the first women to become a prominent folklorist, Mrs. Rubin was also among the first American scholars to document the culture of Eastern European Jews, anticipating by decades the Yiddish revival of the 1970's. Starting in the 1930's, she amassed a collection of about 2,000 songs -- love ballads, lullabies, songs of the factories and streets -- still considered unparalleled in its scope.         ''It is arguably the most important collection, because it's so early,'' said Steven Zeitlin, the director of City Lore, the New York Center for Urban Folk Culture. ''Much of the material dies with the succession of generations. She was collecting songs from the people that learned them in the old country.''         Mrs. Rubin, whose books included ''A Treasury of Jewish Folksong'' (1950) and ''Voices of a People: The Story of Yiddish Folksong'' (1963), also performed the songs in concert and on records. Her studio recordings, first made for Folkways in the 1940's, are available through the Smithsonian Institution.         ''Eastern European Yiddish folk song,'' Mrs. Rubin wrote in the preface to ''Voices of a People,''  ''reflects vividly the life of a community of many millions over a period of many generations. In the songs, we catch the manner of speech and phrase, the wit and humor, the dreams and aspirations, the nonsense, jollity, the pathos and struggle of an entire people.''         Unlike klezmer music, which was performed primarily by men at public occasions, the songs Mrs. Rubin collected flourished in more intimate, domestic settings -- in the kitchen, over the cradle -- and were sung almost exclusively by women, a group largely ignored by the cultural chroniclers of her day.         ''While Irving Howe was writing 'World of Our Fathers,' she was, in a sense, at work on the world of our mothers,'' Mr. Zeitlin said.         Mrs. Rubin was born Rifke Rosenblatt in Montreal on Sept. 1, 1906, the daughter of Jewish immigrants from Bessarabia. As a young woman she moved to New York, with its swirling ferment of Yiddish music, literature and theater, and in 1929 published a volume of her own poems in Yiddish. In 1932 she married Harry Rubin, who died in 1971; the couple's only child, Michael, died in 1959. Mrs. Rubin is survived by a sister, Esther Spivack Marks, of Toronto.         In the mid-1930's Mrs. Rubin began to concentrate seriously on folklore, going on to study with the eminent Yiddish scholar Max Weinreich and, during World War II, translating diaries smuggled out of ghettos and Nazi camps. With the end of the war and the revelation of the extent of the Holocaust, and of its sweeping destruction of Yiddish culture, Mrs. Rubin became even more determined to preserve a piece of what remained by making field recordings.         Dragging her bulky reel-to-reel tape recorder from house to house in cities in Canada and the United States, she captured well-known songs like ''Roizhinkes Mit Mandeln'' (''Raisins and Almonds'') and lesser-known material like ''A Brivele der Maman'' (''A Little Letter to Mama'') and ''Oy, di lumpn /zey zenen shpionen'' (''Oh, the lumpen /  they are spies'').         In the last decades of the 20th century, Mrs. Rubin's work was a cornerstone of the Yiddish revival movement. With an older generation of Jewish singers dying off, young musicians who wanted to learn Yiddish folksongs turned to her books and records. Mrs. Rubin's field recordings are now housed in various collections, including the Archive of Folk Culture at the Library of Congress and the YIVO Institute for Jewish Research in New York.         Mrs. Rubin earned a Ph.D. in 1976 from Union Graduate School in Cleveland, writing her dissertation on the songs of Jewish women. She received an honorary doctorate from the New England Conservatory of Music and YIVO's Lifetime Achievement Award, among other honors.         Although she performed in prestigious concert halls like Town Hall and the Carnegie Recital Hall, Mrs. Rubin regarded these appearances not as recitals but as links in a chain of cultural transmission she hoped would stretch far into the future.         ''She didn't try and put on any great airs,'' recalled the folk singer Pete Seeger, a longtime friend who occasionally performed with her. ''She just sang a song very simply. She was mainly interested in seeing that the song got out so that other people would learn it and sing.''       
         Neuma Goncalves da Silva, a central figure in the slums that served as the testing ground for the composers, seamstresses and fiercely talented layabouts who catapulted samba into an art form, died on Monday in Rio de Janeiro. She was 78.         A poor woman all her life, Ms. Goncalves da Silva rose to national prominence because of her role in the samba school of Mangueira, a sprawling favela in Rio de Janeiro. Her home became a meeting place for the creators of samba, the frenetic, drum-heavy music that accompanies the hip-gyrating dance of the same name.         She founded the women's wing, or ''feminine department,'' of the Mangueira samba school and was its president for several terms. She often sought out the carpenters and sculptors who built the floats, and the seamstresses and designers who created the costumes for the annual Carnival celebration. The school's official colors, pink and green, often show up among the victors in samba competitions.         Ms. Goncalves da Silva was a behind-the-scenes force in electing the male-dominated leadership of the school. Candidacies like that of the acting Mangueira president, Elmo Jose dos Santos, were often said to have been hatched from her modest home on Visconde de Niteroi street.         Ms. Goncalves da Silva also entertained celebrities like the composer Heitor Villa-Lobos and the musician Noel Rosa, as well as many politicians.         One governor recognized Ms. Goncalves da Silva's social role by giving her a telephone, the first in the favela.         The eldest daughter in her poor family, Ms. Goncalves da Silva was born in 1922 in Madureira, another Rio neighborhood, and moved to Mangueira as a child. At the time, samba was emerging as a type of lingua franca among the variants of African-inspired music and dance practiced in Rio.         In 1928, her father, Saturnino Goncalves, was a founder of the Mangueira Samba School and Recreational Society, together with Jose Gomes da Costa, also known as Ze Espinguela, a master of organization who arranged the first competitions among Rio's samba schools. Other founders were the legendary composers Angenor da Silva, or Cartola, and Carlos Moreira de Castro, better known as Carlos Cachaca.         Immersed as she was in music as a child, Ms. Goncalves da Silva, not surprisingly, made samba central to her life, which was always one of economic hardship. To make ends meet, according to one account, she took to washing clothes by hand after being denied a factory job because she was black.         ''Samba never leaves us sad,'' Ms. Goncalves da Silva, affectionately known as Dona Neuma, told one interviewer. ''It never leaves us with that disease which is nostalgia.''         When Maria Tereza Goulart, the wife of Brazil's former president, Joao Goulart, visited Ms. Goncalves da Silva to see the Mangueira school for herself, she was reported to have danced until the wee hours. A headline in a local newspaper read, ''The first lady of the country is received by the first lady of samba.''         Ms. Goncalves da Silva is survived by four children, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.         As samba evolved over the years into a commercialized, multimillion-dollar industry, Ms. Goncalves da Silva wondered whether the musical form could still capture with frivolity the ferocity of existence, as it did when the Mangueira samba school was starting out.         ''These days samba is manufactured instead of delivered from within us,'' she said. ''But I think samba is on a slow voyage to victory.''         After Ms. Goncalves da Silva's burial on Tuesday, her friends and family members gathered to dance until 3 in the morning to some of the legendary sambas with which she was associated.       
         Dr. Josephine D. Martin, a psychiatrist who helped rootless children, troubled adolescents and terrified civil rights activists in a lifelong crusade to weld the healing of personal and social wounds, died on July 6 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         Dr. Martin, who lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, had long battled an autoimmune disorder, her family said.         She became known as the unofficial doctor to the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, or more personally, ''the little lady doctor from up North.'' She had gone to Mississippi to work with children under a precursor of the Head Start program and diagnosed their bloated stomachs as resulting from acute malnutrition. She soon found herself holding the hands of civil rights workers as they experienced daily intimidation and humiliation.         ''She was just something we had never seen before,'' said Unita Blackwell, one of the leaders in the fight to register black voters in Mississippi in the 1960's, and now the mayor of Mayersville, Miss. ''She was a white woman who was caring and loving.''         As Molotov cocktails exploded on Ms. Blackwell's lawn in the Freedom Summer of 1964, Dr. Martin sent Ms. Blackwell's traumatized 7-year-old son to Vermont to attend summer camp. An abandoned New York City child she took under her wing when he was 4 is now a lawyer who will help direct a foundation to be set up in her honor.         Josephine Diaz was born in Tampa, Fla., on Dec. 31, 1915. Her father was born in Spain, became a cigar-maker, then immigrated to Tampa. When Josephine was very young, her family moved to New York City, where she attended elementary and high school.         She contracted tuberculosis as a teenager and spent two years in a sanitarium. At 19, she married a  fellow patient, a social worker named Earl Martin. They worked together organizing people who had had tuberculosis to fight for better treatment.         Meanwhile, she attended several colleges. At the State University of New York in Buffalo, she was offered a scholarship to medical school, but the couple moved because of Mr. Martin's job. She eventually graduated from Hunter College.         She then worked at jobs in medical research and marine biology. Eventually, in her 30's, she entered medical school at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, borrowing and working to pay tuition.         After divorcing Mr. Martin, she married Cedric H. Belfrage, one of the founders of the leftist National Guardian. He was forced to leave the United States because of his political views, said Dr. Martin's third and last husband, Robert J. Schwartz. (Mr. Belfrage is deceased, as is Mr. Martin.)         Dr. Martin went with Mr. Belfrage to London, where she qualified to work for the National Health System; while there, she treated W.E.B. Du Bois, the sociologist and black protest leader, for a heart ailment.         Increasingly, she felt she needed to know more about patients' personal histories and living conditions. Psychiatry seemed a way to bridge the gap.         Back in New York, she entered a psychiatric residency at Bellevue Hospital and stayed on as a full-time psychiatrist working with children and adolescents. She started a day program for mentally ill youths, and, because public schools often refused to accept them, she also set up an educational program for them at Bellevue.         In 1967, after her divorce from Mr. Belfrage, she married Mr. Schwartz, a banker who had helped her with financial matters. Mr. Schwartz was also an economist who organized members of his profession to push for arms reductions. He became a leading advocate of investing in socially responsible enterprises.         ''All my husbands were wonderful men, each appropriate for his time,'' Dr. Martin liked to say.         On July 4, 1963, she and Mr. Schwartz went to Baltimore to participate in a demonstration against an amusement park that refused to admit blacks. They spent the night in jail. On July 8, the Baltimore City Council passed an emergency resolution to set up a human rights commission to mediate the park's racial problems.         ''What better way to spend the Fourth of July than to go to jail in the war for independence for millions of Americans whose freedom from tyranny did not come with the Declaration of Independence of 1776?'' she wrote in the National Guardian at the time.         In 1964, Dr. Martin took an extended vacation from Bellevue to go south, where she worked in the Mississippi Child Development Center, the forerunner of Head Start. Her interest in the South dated to 1950, when she became friends with Claude Williams, a white preacher working to integrate his church in Fungo Hollow, Ala.         She quickly became involved in the civil rights movement as tensions were escalating. She contributed her medical knowledge in teaching sessions and her psychiatric skills in individual sessions with frayed and frightened campaigners.         ''Some, more disturbed, under constant stress, decompensated or engaged in provocative behavior, putting themselves and others at risk,'' Dr. Martin wrote in an autobiographical essay. ''On occasion, hospitalization became necessary.''         She sent the troubled civil rights workers to Manhattan, to Gracie Square Hospital, where she had contacts, for fear of what might happen to them in Southern hospitals.         In his 1972 book, ''The Making of a Black Revolutionary,'' James Forman wrote a personal inscription in the copy he gave Dr. Martin. It said that she ''helped me to unravel many of the conflicting tendencies caused by a very active life, enabling me to bring focus and greater clarity to this head.''         Mr. Schwartz said that several times Mr. Forman, a leader in the Southern struggle, would arrive at their Manhattan apartment saying it was impossible to return to Mississippi. He would consult with Dr. Martin, and ''10 days later he was back again,'' Mr. Schwartz said.         Likening the situation to a M.A.S.H. unit, Ms. Blackwell said, ''She was the doctor who was on the battleground.''         Dr. Martin soon found other battlegrounds back home. Working for St. Luke's-Roosevelt, she set up an innovative home care psychiatric program for residents of welfare hotels. At the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, she worked with troubled adolescents, homeless families and others who needed help.         At the same time, she socialized in Mr. Schwartz's world of Wall Street financiers. During a pause in the conversation, she would say, ''How about giving some clothing to the poor kids at Bellevue?''         Boxes would soon arrive at the hospital's door.         Dr. Martin said her life added up to simply doing the next right thing. ''I had never had the notion that my role was to 'do good' or 'empower' anybody,'' she said, ''but to be able to offer my skills as needed, to live my life as seemed right to me.''       
         Ruth Werner, a colorful and successful Soviet spy whose exploits included radioing invaluable atomic bomb data to Moscow in the middle of World War II, died on July 7 in Berlin. She was 93.         In her 20 years as an intelligence operative in China, Poland, Switzerland and England, she had a number of close calls. But she always managed to extricate herself from the predicament -- unlike Klaus Fuchs, the agent who fed her the British atomic bomb secrets, who was imprisoned in Britain for nine and a half years, or Richard Sorge, the master spy who recruited her, who was executed in Japan in 1941.         Her espionage work was entwined with her romantic life, which included an affair with one of her spy chiefs; later she married a British Communist to become a British citizen and only later came to love him. She told some but not all of her story in a 1974 autobiography, still observing the iron rules of conspiracy by never mentioning Mr. Fuchs, who was still alive.         Ms. Werner was known by the code name Sonja, which was given to her by Mr. Sorge in 1933. Ruth Werner was her pen name. All of her identities had their roots in a prosperous Jewish household in Berlin, where she was born Ursula Ruth Kuczynski, one of six children of Robert Rene and Berta Kuczynski. Her father was a distinguished economist.         Ms. Werner was drawn early to the Communist movement and became a member of the German Communist Party at 19. She was immediately fired by the publishing house where she worked. Soon afterward she met and married Rolf Hamburger, an architect.         She started writing for the party newspaper, Rote Fahne. In 1930, having been told by the party that she would be contacted in Shanghai, she moved with her husband to China.         They began a pleasant bourgeois life, but she was waiting impatiently for the promised contact. It took four months and friendship with Agnes Smedley, an American leftist journalist, who introduced her to Mr. Sorge. Mr. Sorge, then 35, had been the Shanghai agent of the Soviet Army's intelligence service for a year. The service was known by its Russian initials, G.R.U.         Mr. Sorge asked whether she was ready to face danger. She nodded and agreed to make room available for his clandestine meetings with Chinese Communists, the chief interest of Moscow.         Ms. Werner joined the ring without her husband's knowledge, stored weapons and hid a Chinese comrade who was on the run. Two years later, when Mr. Sorge left Shanghai for Moscow, he recommended her to the G.R.U.         Though her marriage was deteriorating, she and her husband had had a son, Michael, while in Shanghai. When the G.R.U. asked her to go to Moscow for training, she left the boy with in-laws in Czechoslovakia.         In the G.R.U. school she learned Morse code, Russian and how to build radio transmitters and receivers. In February 1934 she was sent to turbulent Manchuria, which had been seized from China by the Japanese. Her boss was Ernst, a former sailor, with whom she became romantically involved.         ''Our transmitter was the link between the partisans and the Soviet Union,'' she wrote. She sent coded messages twice a week, and bought and transported chemicals for explosives for the Chinese Communist partisans.         In 1935, Moscow, fearing the two spies were about to be exposed, ordered Ms. Werner and Ernst to flee China. She accepted an assignment in Poland, this time with her husband, although she was pregnant with Ernst's child. Her daughter, Janina, was born in April 1936.         In late 1938 she was sent to Switzerland to set up a new spy ring, again with her husband, but he soon left her and went to the Far East. In February 1939 she met Len Beurton, an English Communist who had fought in Spain with the international brigades. For him, he once wrote, it was ''love at first sight; she had a very good figure.''         In 1940, the G.R.U. authorized a marriage of convenience by which Ms. Werner became British, but the love came to be mutual -- the marriage lasted until his death three years ago.         Ms. Werner had already begun clandestine transmissions from a radio set she had built in her rented house near Oxford when, in 1941, she met Mr. Fuchs, who was working at the British atomic research facility nearby.         The two spies would bicycle into the countryside for their meetings, and Mr. Fuchs would hand over written materials that, Ms. Werner once told an interviewer, were ''like hieroglyphics.''         Norman Moss, author of ''Klaus Fuchs: The Man Who Stole the Atomic Bomb'' (1987), said that Vyacheslav Molotov, Stalin's chief aide, set up the Soviet atomic bomb project in 1942 as a result of the information transmitted by Mr. Fuchs and Ms. Werner, and that the information saved the Soviet researchers a great deal of time. The Soviets detonated their first atomic bomb in 1949.         Ms. Werner was also running other agents, including a Royal Air Force officer, a specialist in submarine radar and even her brother and father. She was once told that the chief of G.R.U. had said, ''If we had five Sonjas in England, the war would end sooner.''         In the early 1950's she and her family -- another son, Peter, had been born in 1943 -- left England for East Berlin. Her only connection with the G.R.U. after that was in 1969, when she was invited to a ceremony to receive her second Red Banner, the highest Soviet military decoration.         She turned to writing, producing some short stories; a biography of Olga Benario, a German Communist who was gassed by the Nazis in 1942; and her autobiography.         She is survived by her three children, five grandchildren and three sisters.       
         Nija Battle, who brought a swaggering sense of sophistication to the furs she designed for the music world's most tireless clotheshorses, died last Thursday while on a business trip in Montreal. She was 37.         The cause was a brain aneurysm, said her sister, Saddiya Battle.         For a designer who did not have a store, who often met her future clients at clubs or outside restaurants, and who, until the editor Andre Leon Talley wrote about her in Vogue last year, was almost unknown in the fashion world, Ms. Battle had a large following. Her custom-made furs were worn by entertainers like Whitney Houston, Lil' Kim, Kid Rock and Puff Daddy, who had her make trousers for him in black sheared mink.         And although much of the attention at the Costume Institute's ''Rock Style'' gala at the Metropolitan Museum of Art last December was focused on fashion nabobs like Tom Ford of Gucci and Donatella Versace, it was Ms. Battle of Brooklyn who designed the wraps worn by Naomi Campbell, Iman, Lynn Whitfield and Mary J. Blige, who had on a turquoise fur chubby.         Ms. Battle began making furs about 10 years ago, though in a sense, she started as a child when she and her sister would take skins given to them by their father, an avid hunter, and turn them into blankets and doll clothes. The family lived in Brooklyn but had relatives in North Carolina, and Ms. Battle, who was part Tuscarora Indian, often visited a grandmother there who raised minks.         After getting experience with Orchard Street furriers, Ms. Battle started her own business and gradually gained a following among rap and hip-hop stars who saw her out wearing her own designs.         ''When people like Puff Daddy were photographed for magazines, they'd say to the stylists, 'I'm wearing my own coat,' '' recalled her sister. They meant, of course, Ms. Battle's furs. She also created coats for a number of sports stars, and, on occasion, made identical styles for their wives and children.         Her custom-made designs, often dyed in colors like champagne, burgundy and green, projected a high urban style -- what Mr. Talley called ''a ghetto fabulousness'' -- that not only appealed to Ms. Battle's celebrated clientele but also evoked the 1970's in fashion. She was certainly among the first designers to recognize the appeal of reviving that era.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by her mother, Gladys, and her brother, Saleem Muhammad, both of Brooklyn.       
         Loretta Young, the Academy Award-winning actress whose high cheekbones, pale skin and luminous eyes made her a reigning Hollywood beauty of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 87 and lived in Palm Springs, Calif.         Miss Young, who won an Oscar as best actress for her performance in ''The Farmer's Daughter'' in 1947, later became a favorite of television viewers as the glowing star who twirled onto the stage in a designer gown each week to introduce an uplifting drama on ''The Loretta Young Show.'' She retired almost 40 years ago and never returned to the big screen.         Miss Young died at the home of her sister, Georgiana Montalban, the wife of the actor Ricardo Montalban, said Norman Brokaw, the chairman of the William Morris agency and her agent for 50 years. The cause was ovarian cancer, he said.         Hers was an art learned early in life. She first appeared on screen at age 4 as a fairy in the silent film ''The Primrose Ring.'' In 1928, she became a leading lady, starring opposite Lon Chaney in ''Laugh, Clown, Laugh.'' In addition to ''The Farmer's Daughter,'' in which she played an effervescent Swedish-born maid who runs for Congress, she appeared in nearly 100 films, often in the arms of such matinee idols as Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy, Tyrone Power or Cary Grant.         Her movies included ''Taxi'' with James Cagney in 1932; ''Zoo in Budapest'' with Gene Raymond in 1933; ''Man's Castle'' with Tracy, also in 1933; ''Call of the Wild'' with Gable in 1935; ''The Stranger'' with Orson Welles and Edward G. Robinson in 1946; and ''The Bishop's Wife'' with Grant in 1947.         Miss Young's screen image suggested a blend of virtuous poise, sensuality and vulnerability, and in fact, she once admitted to having had ''crushes'' on all of her leading men and to being ''susceptible'' to men in general. Reflecting on her appeal to moviegoers, she told Edward J. Funk, co-author of an unpublished autobiography:         ''My appeal wouldn't have been to the intellectuals or the neurotics. Nor to the shop girls and secretaries -- that would have been Joan Crawford's market. But there were an awful lot of women out there who were like me -- who were willing to play by the rules, didn't sleep around and were very aggressive. A Loretta Young movie had a happy ending; that's what it was geared to: a nice husband, nice lover, no abuse of any kind -- that's what the heroes and heroines were in those days.''         While Miss Young said she considered herself more of a ''movie star'' than an actress, she achieved her greatest popularity as the ''first lady'' of dramatic television, with ''The Loretta Young Show.'' In the half-hour anthology series, which ran on NBC from 1953 to 1961, Miss Young played characters from Queen Nefertiti to a nightclub singer. A trademark of the show was her glamorous entrance.         ''I did that to mollify the show's designer, Marusha,'' Miss Young said in a 1995 interview. ''I initially just walked through the doors, and Marusha was upset because no one would see the wonderful back of the dress.''         So Miss Young, who had studied ballet as a child, asked for a retake in which she entered the set and pirouetted before walking toward the camera. Viewers loved it.         The show at first was an audacious step for her, since at the time a fearful Hollywood was attacking television, a new medium and a formidable rival. Miss Young said friends and advisers warned her that if she appeared on television regularly she would be ''blackballed out of this business'' and ''never get another job.'' But she saw television as the ''wave of the future,'' and signed a contract with NBC and Procter & Gamble to produce and star in the dramatic series.         Miss Young appeared in 165 episodes. A devout Catholic, she ended each show by delivering a homily to the audience. Her show extolled ''respect for law and order and for disciplined deportment and character-building standards,'' she said in her 1961 memoir, ''The Things I Had to Learn,'' written with Helen Ferguson. ''Above all, we want to prove the strength, the good, really, of people.''         Although critics derided the moralistic melodramas as ''Sunday night soap opera,'' the series became one of the most popular on television, earning Miss Young millions of dollars and a reputation as one of the best businesswomen in Hollywood.         In 1972, she was awarded $559,000 by a jury in a breach-of-contract suit against NBC in which she contended that the network had humiliated her through the overseas release of introductory and closing segments of the show showing her in outmoded gowns and hairstyles.         She won the first of three Emmy Awards in 1953, which made her the first actress to win both an Oscar and an Emmy. The annual poll of TV-Radio Mirror readers earned her six consecutive gold medals as their favorite actress, and an episode of the series received the first television Grand Prix at the 1959 Cannes International Film Festival. The series was revived in 1962 as ''The New Loretta Young Show'' and ran for a year.         In 1995, Nostalgia Television, a national cable network, began reruns of the original show, the rights to which Miss Young had turned over to her son, Christopher Lewis, and his wife, Linda, who are film producers.         Perhaps the biggest controversy in her long career arose years after she left the screen. In 1994, her adopted daughter, Judy Lewis, maintained in an autobiography, ''Uncommon Knowledge,'' that she was the daughter of Miss Young and Clark Gable and that she was conceived during the making of ''Call of the Wild,'' in which the two starred.         In 1935 when the film was made, Miss Young was single and Gable was married to Ria Langham. Miss Lewis said that Miss Young was terrified that a scandal would end her career and Gable's, and that she had arranged to give birth in secret, taking more than a year off from work and citing an unspecified illness. Later, Miss Lewis asserted, Miss Young arranged her ''adoption,'' retrieving her from an orphanage where she had been temporarily placed.         For years, Miss Young refused to confirm or deny her daughter's account, dismissing it as ''a rumor from a bygone era.'' After the book's release, mother and daughter did not speak to each other for months.         Mr. Brokaw said yesterday, ''She didn't want to ever publicly acknowledge it.''         Miss Young, whose given name was Gretchen Michaela, was born on Jan. 6, 1913, in Salt Lake City. When she was 2 her parents separated, and her mother moved with her daughters and son, Jack, to Hollywood. She borrowed $1,000 from a Roman Catholic bishop, persuaded a department store to let her have furniture on credit and opened a boardinghouse.         Miss Young attended a convent school and began appearing as a child extra in movies, often working with her older sisters, Polly Ann and Betty Jane.         First National Studio signed her to a contract at age 14, put braces on her teeth and renamed her Loretta, a change she gladly accepted as evidence that she was on her way to becoming a star.         In 1930, at 17, Miss Young eloped with Grant Withers, her co-star in the film ''The Second-Story Murder.'' The marriage was annulled the following year. In 1940, she married Thomas H. A. Lewis, an advertising executive who later became a producer of her television series. The couple, who divorced in 1969, had two sons, Christopher, a producer, and Peter, a guitarist and songwriter.         Strong-willed, independent and rebellious, Miss Young was among the first female stars to command a six-figure salary. In 1939, when she rejected a five-year, $2 million contract with 20th Century Fox to try working as a freelance actress, she was blackballed by the studios. She made only one film, ''Eternally Yours,'' with David Niven, during the next two years.         She owned the rights to ''The Loretta Young Show'' and had control over its content, casting and final editing. And she paid strict attention to the show's moral tone.         During the filming for one episode, ''Come to the Stable,'' about two nuns who come to the United States from France to build a hospital for children, Miss Young became so disturbed by swearing on the set that she came up with the idea of a ''swear box.'' Cast and crew had to contribute up to 25 cents for each offense, and the money was donated to a home for unmarried mothers.         In 1963, at age 50, with movie offers still coming her way, Miss Young left show business. She later acknowledged that her retirement was perhaps premature and that she had always intended to resume her career. Although she was offered more than 150 parts, her last major role was that of an owner of a fashion magazine in ''Lady in the Corner,'' a 1989 television drama.         She lived an almost reclusive life and was rarely interviewed or photographed, although she occasionally appeared in public to promote one of her favorite charities. Her later years were quietly shared with her third husband, Jean Louis, a designer for Columbia Pictures, whom she married in 1994. Mr. Louis won an Oscar of his own in 1956 for his designs for ''The Solid Gold Cadillac.''         Mr. Louis died in 1997. In addition to her sister, Mrs. Montalban, Miss Young is survived by her three children.         Miss Young said that her faith sustained her through the difficult times in her life and that her mother had given her an invaluable sense of worth, independence and flair. In her memoir, she wrote: ''I believe that if we have lived our lives fully and well, and have accomplished, at least in part, the things which we were put here to do, we will be prepared -- mentally, spiritually and physically -- for our separation from this world.''

         Sally Amato, a singer and actress who founded the Amato Opera with her husband, the conductor Anthony Amato, died on Wednesday at her home in City Island in the Bronx. She was 82.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. Amato was in many ways the welcoming face of her family-run opera company. An operagoer was greeted by her at the door of the tiny Amato theater on the Bowery, and would then proceed down a flight of stairs or into the balcony, where Mr. Amato would conduct, stopping at intermission to draw raffles out of a barrel and award prizes to audience members. The company became a home for enthusiasts on both sides of the footlights: amateur singers (and some who became professionals) go there to learn and perform the great works and occasional rarities, and opera lovers on tight budgets go there to hear their favorite scores.         Mrs. Amato was born Serafina Bellantone in Manhattan in 1917. She began her performing career as a child, when she and her sisters performed vaudeville skits in movie theaters, and she continued to work as an actress and singer into the first decades of the Amato Opera, which she and her husband started in 1948.         She met Mr. Amato in 1943, when they were both performing at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J. The meeting itself was not auspicious: Mr. Amato and Ms. Bellantone had been cast as American Indians, and in one scene Mr. Amato was to throw his future wife to the floor and kick her. But she was charmed by his expressions of concern when the scene ended. She also said that she admired his tenor voice.         The Amatos married in 1945, and continued to work together at the American Theater Wing, where Mr. Amato directed workshops. They also shared an abiding love of opera, and it occurred to them soon after World War II that a company was needed to provide opportunities for aspiring singers returning from military service. The Amato Opera gave its first performances in the basement of Our Lady of Pompeii Church in Greenwich Village. The company later moved to 159 Bleecker Street; in 1963 it took over the jewel box theater at the corner of the Bowery and Second Street that has been its home ever since.         Mrs. Amato performed with the company under her maiden name for several seasons, but she increasingly took on many of the house's nonmusical jobs. She made many of the company's costumes, ran its box office, and operated its lighting board.         Mrs. Amato is survived by her husband and a sister, Ann Frydel, of Manhattan.       
         Ginetta Sagan, a leader of the American branch of Amnesty International who as a girl fought World War II's injustices in Europe and suffered for it, died last Friday at her home in Atherton, Calif., between San Francisco and San Jose. She was 75.         The cause was cancer, said the American organization, which named her honorary chairwoman in 1994, the year she also received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.         Mrs. Sagan, a native of Milan, was active in Italy's anti-Fascist Resistance in World War II and survived torture and imprisonment. Denied dignity and freedom then, she championed prisoners of conscience for the rest of her life.         She came to Washington in the 1960's and helped establish the American division of Amnesty International. The worldwide group had been  founded in London in 1961 to speak for the victims of oppressive regimes. Today Amnesty International has 1.1 million members, 290,000 in the United States.         When she moved to California, Mrs. Sagan formed the group's first outposts in the western United States.  She served two terms on the national board, and Amnesty International U.S.A. now gives an annual Ginetta Sagan Award for outstanding work on behalf of oppressed women and children.         Mrs. Sagan was born Ginetta Moroni, the daughter of doctors who would both work for the Italian Resistance. By the time she was 17, she was taking clothing and food coupons to beleaguered Jews.         Her parents were arrested in 1943, and she never saw them again. That year she became a courier for a clandestine party in northern Italy and helped print and distribute pamphlets. She was betrayed, and arrested by the Fascist authorities, who subjected her to 45 days of interrogation and torture.         But there were instances of unexpected kindness, too. A jailer once threw a loaf of bread into her cell, and inside she found a matchbox and a slip of paper with a single word: ''coraggio'' -- courage.         And when members of the Resistance engineered her escape from prison in the Alpine town of Sondrio, near Lake Como, on April 23, 1945, they were helped by two German officers.         She then lived in Paris with her godfather, an American banker, and attended the Sorbonne. By 1951, she was studying child development at the University of Illinois's Chicago campus, where she met and married Leonard Sagan, a medical student. Their work and travels took them to Washington, Boston, Japan and finally the San Francisco Bay Area.         In addition to forming new Amnesty chapters, Mrs. Sagan established the Aurora Foundation, which documents civil rights abuses in countries with authoritarian governments.         Dr. Leonard Sagan, a physician, died in 1997. Mrs. Sagan is survived by three sons: Loring, of San Francisco; Duncan, of Newark, Calif.; and Pico, of London, as well as six grandchildren.       
         Annie Devine, a no-nonsense Mississippi trailblazer for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, died on Aug. 22 at a hospital in Ridgeland, Miss. She was 88 and lived in nearby Canton.         Mrs. Devine, a soft-spoken woman with a ready smile, became deeply involved in the civil rights movement of the early 1960's. She helped organize voter registration drives in Canton and surrounding Madison County, where fewer than 100 of the county's estimated 10,000 black adults were registered.         At the time, blacks in the Deep South were kept from the ballot boxes by legal chicanery and worse; in Mississippi 94 percent of black adults were not registered. Thanks largely to Mrs. Devine, blacks began to show up at the county courthouse almost daily, demanding to register.         She attended the 1964 Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City along with Victoria Gray-Adams and Fannie Lou Hamer. Their objective was to unseat their state's all-white delegation and be recognized as delegates of the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party, of which Mrs. Devine was a founder.         After that failed, the three sought to run for the House of Representatives, but were shunned by the white party establishment and blocked from running as independents. When the new Congress was sworn in January 1965, the three women, backed by hundreds of protesters, demanded that the House deny membership to Mississippi's representatives-elect because blacks had consistently been prevented from registering and voting in the state. Their effort, called the Mississippi Challenge, failed in the short run, but led to a nationwide lobbying drive by the Mississippi Freedom Democrats and calls for Congressional investigations into voting in Mississippi. Thus, the three women's resolve fed into the groundswell that produced the Voting Rights Act of 1965.         Annie Devine was born in Mobile, Ala., and reared in Canton. She graduated from Tougaloo Southern Christian College, now Tougaloo College, and taught in the public schools. She was an executive for a life-insurance company before she threw her energies into the civil rights struggle.         In the 1960's she also helped found the Child Development Group of Mississippi. Under its aegis she was a longtime volunteer in the Head Start program, involving parents and marshaling community support.         Mrs. Devine's husband, Andrew, died in 1973. She is survived by two daughters, Monette Watts of Harvest, Ala., and Barbara Russell of Canton; a son, Andrew, of Omaha; a brother, Garfield Heath of Detroit; 8 grandchildren and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Dawn Langley Simmons, an author whose tumultuous life included a sex change operation and an interracial marriage that scandalized her adopted hometown, Charleston, S.C., died on Sept. 18 at her daughter's home there. She was 77.         Mrs. Simmons, who was the adopted child of the English actress Margaret Rutherford, had Parkinson's disease, said her daughter, Natasha.         Mrs. Simmons was the author of more than 20 books, including novels, biographies, and books for her children. Several of her books understandably touched on her life experiences, given a journey that started on an English estate, touched down on an Indian reservation and stirred deep turmoil in civil-rights-era Charleston.         Jack Hitt, a journalist who grew up in Charleston across the street from Mrs. Simmons and wrote about her for GQ magazine, remembered her as a figure with a piercing stare, a pillbox hat and ''a Dippity-Do hairstyle -- a dowdy doppelganger of Jackie Kennedy.''         Mrs. Simmons was a person around whom legends swirled, Mr. Hitt said. She lived in a grand house filled with antiques and with a hidden garden. She was said to have had a coming-out party for two of her dogs, who were displayed on velvet cushions in the living room, dressed in chenille, long gloves and pearls.         Mrs. Simmons was named Gordon Langley Hall when she was born, at Sissinghurst, the estate of the writer Vita Sackville-West, in Heathfield, Sussex, England. Gordon was the illegitimate child of Jack Copper, Sackville-West's chauffeur (a grandfather was Rudyard Kipling's gardener) and Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, who came, Mrs. Simmons always said, from a high social class.         Mrs. Simmons said she was born with an adrenal abnormality that causes the female genitalia to resemble a man's and was thus raised as a boy. She always maintained that she was -- unequivocally -- female.         As a boy, young Gordon played with Sackville-West's son, Nigel Nicolson. Mr. Nicolson remembered Gordon in a telephone conversation from England last Friday. ''We called him 'Dinky,' and I always think of him that way,'' he said, adding that young Gordon always looked like a boy.         At Sissinghurst, the young Gordon met Virginia Woolf, Ms. Sackville-West's lover and the author of ''Orlando,'' a novel about a boy who changes into a beautiful woman. ''Had she lived a little longer, Vita would have been intrigued to know that the child 'Dinky,' as she called me, would become a real-life Orlando,'' Mrs. Simmons wrote in her memoir, ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend,''(1995, Wyrick & Company).         In his late teens, Mr. Hall emigrated to Ontario, where he worked as a missionary, teacher and midwife among the Ojibwa Indians, according to his book about his experiences, ''Me Papoose Sitter'' (Crowell, 1955). He became an editor for The Winnipeg Free Press, and from 1953 to 1956 was society editor of The Nevada Daily Mail in Missouri. Mr. Nicolson said he was ''a very good journalist.''         He also wrote books about Princess Margaret, Jacqueline Kennedy and American Evangelism. According to the reference work ''Contemporary Authors,'' a critic named W. H. Archer praised Mr. Hall's ''Rose for Mrs. Lincoln: A Biography of Mary Todd Lincoln'' (Beacon Press, 1970), calling it ''scrupulously researched'' and written in ''a charmingly premeditated style.''         In New York in his 20's, Mr. Hall met Margaret Rutherford, who became enchanted with him and, with her husband, Stringer Davis, adopted him.         In that period Mr. Hall also befriended the painter Isabel Whitney, who left him $2 million at her death in 1962, he said. Around that time, he moved to Charleston, settling into a faded 1840 house on Society Street in the Ansonborough section, which had a large gay population. He became friendly with Charleston's grandes dames, restored his house and filled it with Chippendale furniture, mirrors said to belong to George Washington, and bed steps said to have been owned by Robert E. Lee.         In 1968 he underwent a sex change operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and became Dawn Pepita Langley Hall.         The following year Dawn Hall married her 22-year-old black butler, John-Paul Simmons. The publisher of ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' was quoted as calling it the first documented interracial marriage in Charleston's history. A bomb threat forced the couple to move the wedding from a Baptist church to the bride's home, and the gifts were destroyed by a firebomb.         In England, Miss Rutherford was reported to have said, ''I am delighted that Gordon has become a woman, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of another race, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of a lower station, but I understand the man is a Baptist!''         Soon, Mrs. Simmons appeared to be pregnant. Then in 1972, she began strolling with a baby carriage bearing a little girl whom she called Natasha.         That was the final straw for many people in Charleston. Mrs. Simmons claimed that a white man broke into her house wearing a ski mask and beat her, breaking her nose and foot and necessitating hospitalization.         She also said that her husband beat her. In 1974, after a period of turbulence in which she accused her husband of selling her belongings to buy whisky, the family moved to Catskill, N.Y. Some time later, Mr. Simmons was confined to a mental institution near Albany. His daughter says he is now an outpatient.         Mrs. Simmons spent most of her later years in Hudson, N.Y., where she was an active member of a local Episcopal church and a leader of its youth group. She continued to support her husband and daughter on her meager earnings as a writer.         Her daughter said she would prefer not to discuss her mother's past. ''I would like her to be remembered as the grandmother that she was, as a family woman,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''She was devoted to my children.''         In addition to her husband and daughter, Mrs. Simmons is survived by three grandchildren.         After she published ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' in 1995, her childhood friend, Mr. Nicolson, reminisced about her in The Spectator. ''I have maligned her in the past, mocked her strange fate and refused to meet her,'' he wrote.         ''She had asked me for help in arranging an English marriage,'' he wrote, ''and when she called on me, I hid.'' On a trip to Charleston, he avoided meeting her, but saw her on television. ''I saw on the wall behind her photographs of my mother,'' he continued. ''For the first time I was touched.''         But ''there is not a word of reproach for me in her book,'' Mr. Nicolson marveled. ''Like everything else about Dinky, it is gallant, resilient and unfailingly generous.''       
         Paula Yates,  a British television personality known for her outrageously flirtatious interviewing style and for her relationships with the rock stars Bob Geldof and Michael Hutchence, was found dead at home here on Sunday. She was 40.         The cause was apparently a drug overdose, the authorities said.         Reared in north Wales, Ms. Yates left school at 16 and moved to London, where she joined the emerging punk scene and embarked on an extravagant -- and extravagantly public -- life. When she became enamored of Mr. Geldof, who was then the lead singer of the Boomtown Rats, she followed the band on tour until Mr. Geldof became just as smitten with her, and they embarked on a relationship. They married 10 years later and had three daughters, Fifi Trixibelle, Peaches and Pixie.         Ms. Yates reveled in the spotlight, posing naked in the stuffy Reform Club for Penthouse magazine and compiling a book of photographs called ''Rock Stars in Their Underpants,'' which Andy Warhol called ''the greatest work of art in the last decade.'' She also wrote several books for children, but it was not until she started her television career as a co-presenter of ''The Tube,'' a show about music, that she became a celebrity in her own right, affecting a bubbleheaded, giggly personality that belied her sharp intelligence, friends said.         In 1992 she began presenting ''The Big Breakfast Show,'' a morning television program in which she often interviewed guests while lying on a bed in the studio. One guest was Michael Hutchence, the lead singer of the band INXS, and the two fell madly in love. She left Mr. Geldof, setting off a bitter, tabloid-fueled divorce and an equally bitter fight for custody of their three daughters. Mr. Geldof won.         Ms. Yates and Mr. Hutchence had an intensely passionate affair and one child, a daughter they named Heavenly Hiraani Tiger Lily. But their relationship was marred by drug use and extreme behavior that ended when Mr. Hutchence was found dead, hanging by his belt, in a hotel room in Sydney, Australia, in November 1997.         Ms. Yates, who once said that Mr. Hutchence was ''God's gift to women,'' seemed never to recover from his death, spiraling into a depression that resulted in her admission to a mental hospital and at least one suicide attempt of her own.         It was hard for her to hang on, she once said in an interview. ''It's only the mothering instinct that makes you willing to suffer every day,'' she said. ''Right now, I think living is a noble gesture.''       
         Ann Doran, a character actress who appeared in hundreds of movies and television shows over the course of a career that began during the silent film era and lasted into the 1980's, died on Sept. 19 in Carmichael, Calif. She was 89.         Ms. Doran's more memorable roles included a panicky passenger aboard a disabled airliner in ''The High and the Mighty'' (1954), whose cast included John Wayne and Claire Trevor, and James Dean's tormented mother in ''Rebel Without a Cause'' (1955). She was a regular in the series of films based on the comic strip ''Blondie,'' which starred Penny Singleton and Arthur Lake.         Her film credits also included  ''Penny Serenade,'' with Cary Grant and Irene Dunne; ''Here Come the Waves,'' with Bing Crosby and Betty Hutton; ''The Strange Love of Martha Ivers,'' with Barbara Stanwyck and Van Heflin; ''My Favorite Brunette,'' with Bob Hope and Dorothy Lamour; and ''No Sad Songs for Me,'' with Margaret Sullavan.         Ms. Doran, who was born in Amarillo, Tex., was the daughter of Carrie Barnett, an actress who appeared in silent films and had her child performing in front of the cameras almost as soon as she could walk. By the time Ms. Doran reached her 20's, she was ready for any role that came her way.       
         Katherine W. Fanning, a former owner of The Anchorage Daily News who later served as editor of The Christian Science Monitor, died on Thursday. She was 73.         Ms. Fanning died of colon cancer at her Boston home, where she lived with her husband and was writing a book about her years in Alaska. She was regarded as a pioneering figure in the world of journalism, especially because she was working at a time when few women held positions of power within the industry.         Under her ownership, the Daily News fought its way up from a circulation of 12,000 to 50,000, becoming Alaska's largest newspaper. Along the way, it won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for a 15-part series on the powerful Teamsters union in Alaska.         The newspaper also took controversial liberal stands on gun control, environmental issues and the land rights of Alaskan natives, earning it the enmity of the business establishment.         Nothing in Ms. Fanning's childhood and early married life hinted that she would, at nearly age 40, reinvent herself as a risk-taking journalist.         She was born on Oct. 18, 1927, in Joliet, Ill. The only child of a bank president, she went to private schools, made her debut at a tea dance in 1945 and graduated from Smith College in 1949. That year, she met Marshall Field IV, a multimillionaire whose family owned a department store chain and published The Chicago Sun-Times.         She once credited that marriage as her introduction and informal education in the world of journalism, but never considered working in the field until much later. While her husband ran the business, she volunteered at various charities. Society columnists dubbed her ''the Grace Kelly of Chicago.''         But in 1963, Ms. Fanning and her husband divorced because of what she later called her discontent with the high-society lifestyle. She joined the Christian Science church. Then in 1965, she piled her three children into a Buick station wagon and drove north on the Alaska Highway.         ''After the divorce, my life was on a downhill slide,'' she told a writer for Town & Country in 1986. ''I needed to grab onto something solid and permanent.''         She found that in the rugged land of Alaska.         At the end of their road trip, the family settled in Anchorage. The Daily News, an eight-page tabloid that was then overshadowed by The Anchorage Times, hired Ms. Fanning to organize its library for $2 an hour. She quickly moved up through the ranks to become a reporter whose byline appeared frequently on the front page. She once credited Alaska with fostering the kind of opportunities that anyone with willpower and an entrepreneurial spirit could take advantage of.         In 1966, she married Larry Fanning, who had worked as editor of The Chicago Sun-Times. He had gone to Alaska to help Ms. Fanning sell her house but became enamored with the state. Against the advice of several friends, the two bought the Daily News in 1967. The newspaper began running investigative stories that riled the corporate establishment. Many businesses refused to advertise in the newspaper.         Mr. Fanning died at his desk of a heart attack in 1971. His wife became the sole editor and publisher, and persisted in keeping up the newspaper's crusading efforts. Under her tenure, and with large infusions of money from Ted Field, Ms. Fanning's son from her first marriage, the newspaper continued to thrive. It received the Pulitzer Prize for public service in 1976 for its series on the Teamsters.         In 1983, Ms. Fanning moved to Boston to become editor of The Christian Science Monitor. She married her third husband, Amos Mathews, around the same time. During her five years at The Monitor, she was credited with building up the publication's news coverage. But in 1988, she and two other top editors resigned over budget cuts imposed by the church.         After she left The Monitor, Ms. Fanning spent a year at the Institute of Politics at Harvard. She then taught classes as an adjunct professor at Boston University until 1993.         While living in Boston, Ms. Fanning also held influential positions at several news organizations. She became the first woman president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, and she joined the board of directors of The Boston Globe Newspaper Company in 1992. From 1988 to 1989, she sat on the board of directors of The Associated Press. She also served on the board of several charitable foundations.         In her final years, she began work on a memoir about her work in Alaska. She never really left the state that she loved -- she and her husband kept a home in Anchorage where they lived for four months each year. The two also traveled extensively, taking trips to Syria, Jordan, Russia and Malaysia.         Ms. Fanning is survived by her husband and three children: Mr. Field of Los Angeles, Katherine Stephen of Washington, D.C., and Barbara Field of Boston.

         Jeanne Lee, one of the great jazz singers in the avant-garde tradition and a teacher of singing, composition and movement, died on Wednesday in Tijuana, Mexico. She was 61.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Naima Hazelton.         Because Ms. Lee performed in two radically different styles, her singing was difficult to categorize. One of her voices was dry, slow and breathy,  influenced by Billie Holiday and Dinah Washington.         In 1961 she and a classmate from Bard College, the pianist Ran Blake, performed as a duo at the Apollo Theater's Amateur Night contest. They won, and the album they later recorded, ''The Newest Sound Around'' (later reissued on CD as ''The Legendary Duets''), has remained a cult favorite.         In jazz standards and Thelonious Monk tunes on the album, Ms. Lee and Mr. Blake subtracted swing, but added intellectual coolness, abstruse piano harmonies and vocal influences from Holiday and Washington; the record is a series of minimalist dreams. (In 1989 she and Mr. Blake  recorded a duet album in the same style, ''You Stepped Out of a Cloud.'')         In her other vocal style, Ms. Lee approached words as sounds; this voice was harsh and booming, and she used her teeth, lips and tongue to wring drama out of each syllable, presaging singers like Diamanda Galas. In the mid-1960's she was a multidisciplinary artist, writing music with members of the Fluxus school like Alison Knowles and Dick Higgins, and gradually becoming more aligned with the rest of the late-1960's avant-garde in jazz.         When she met and fell in love with the vibraphonist and composer Gunter Hampel in 1967, she began 20 years of collaborations with him in different jazz-related forms.         While at Bard, Ms. Lee had studied child psychology and in 1970 was awarded a Martin Luther King Fellowship for Urban Studies by New York University to develop a curriculum for elementary school students that combined music and dance with academic subjects.         She shuttled between New York and Europe until the late 1980's, living and working with Mr. Hampel, performing in duets, small groups and big bands, as well as conducting clinics and workshops; the couple made some 25 albums together, many of them for Mr. Hampel's own label, Birth.         Ms. Lee also recorded with Marion Brown, Andrew Cyrille, Carla Bley, Peter Kowald and Reggie Workman, among others. She was active as a composer, combining vocal jazz with music and dance, working often with the choreographer Mickey Davidson.         She lived in New York from 1994 to 1996 and for the last five years  taught music and movement at conservatories in Antwerp, Belgium,  and in The Hague.         In addition to Ms. Hazelton of Los Angeles, she is survived by another daughter, Cavana Lee-Hampel of Berlin; a son, Ruomi Lee-Hampel of New York; and a grandson.       
         Miriam Wolfe, whose long acting career embraced radio, television and the theater, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Toronto. She was 78.         Ms. Wolfe played a wide variety of characters during her lifetime but was perhaps best known for her skill at conveying an assortment of wicked witches, evil queens and nasty stepmothers on programs like Nila Mack's ''Let's Pretend,'' a popular Saturday morning children's show on WCBS radio during the 1930's, 40's and early 50's. A demonic cackle Ms. Wolfe had mastered as a child sent chills over the airwaves, especially in Mutual Network's radio serial ''The Witch's Tale.''         Born in Brooklyn, Ms. Wolfe made her acting debut at 4, reciting poems on ''The Uncle Gee Bee Kiddie Hour'' on WBGS radio, an early station in New York. In later years she played parts on ''Studio One'' and ''Ford Theater,'' working with the likes of Lucille Ball, Montgomery Clift and Ingrid Bergman. She also appeared on ''Mystery Hall,'' ''Casey, Crime Photographer'' and ''Suspense.'' In the 1950's, Ms. Wolfe joined ''The Rayburn & Finch Comedy Hour.'' She also acted on ''The Adventures of Popeye,'' playing Olive Oyl.         In 1956 Ms. Wolfe moved to Canada, where she married John Forrest Mackay Ross and went to work for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation as an actor, writer and director. While there, she adapted, directed and played all the roles in a radio version of Paul Bowles's ''You Are Not I.'' She also appeared on Canadian television in shows like ''Wayne and Shuster.'' On many occasions, she continued to be heard but not seen as the dubbed-in voices of characters in films and cartoons.         Her theater work included the Broadway production of ''Make Momma Happy'' and a production of Tennessee Williams's ''Rose Tattoo'' in Hollywood. And she was the author of ''Listening to Language: The Sounds of English.''         She is survived by a son, Michael Ross, of Occidental, Calif.       
         Sirimavo Bandaranaike of Sri Lanka, the first woman in the world to serve as a prime minister, died yesterday shortly after voting in Sri Lanka's elections. She was 84.         Mrs. Bandaranaike's final act was to vote in a parliamentary election she hoped would return the family's party to power leading a governing coalition known as the People's Alliance. Her death from a heart attack on Election Day seemed poetically timed for a woman whose family business is politics and whose political career spanned four decades.         Mrs. Bandaranaike rose to power in 1960 as a bereaved wife and mother of three, just a year after her husband, Solomon, then prime minister, was assassinated by a Buddhist monk. She quickly established herself as the undisputed leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party -- founded by her husband -- and a formidable politician in her own right.         She also became the matriarch of a political dynasty. In the final years of her life, her daughter, Chandrika Kumaratunga, succeeded her as the standard bearer of the family party and has served as president of the country since 1994. The father, mother and daughter have led Sri Lanka for 21 of the 52 years since it gained its independence from the British.         ''Mrs. Bandaranaike's legacy is this: After her husband died, there was so much confusion and the party was almost collapsing,'' said K. M. de Silva, a Sri Lankan historian. ''She was an untried leader. But she not only survived, she sustained the party and the family in politics.''         Her body was taken to her stately  home on Rosemead Place in the Cinnamon Gardens section of Colombo, the capital. State radio canceled regular programs to play elegiac music and state television looked back on her life.         She will be buried alongside her husband on Saturday in a state funeral at the family's ancestral home in Horagulla. Friday and Saturday have been declared days of national mourning. All liquor shops, bars, cinemas and slaughterhouses have been ordered to close.         ''She was a heroic mother of the nation,'' the Sri Lanka Freedom Party said in a statement.         But the Sri Lanka Freedom Party has come to stand for very different policies and values than it had in her day.         Mrs. Kumaratunga firmly repudiated her mother's brand of Sinhalese nationalism, which had inflamed ethnic tensions between the mostly Buddhist Sinhalese majority and the predominantly Hindu Tamil minority. The daughter's years in office have been dominated by her as-yet-fruitless efforts to end a 17-year-old war with separatist Tamil rebels. Mrs. Kumaratunga also steered the party toward a more open, market-oriented economy and away from the centralized, state-dominated socialism that had been her mother's trademark.         Mrs. Bandaranaike was born Sirimavo Ratwatte on April 17, 1916, into one of the island nation's wealthy feudal families, one that was at the pinnacle of Sri Lanka's social hierarchy. In 1940 -- 60 years ago today -- she married S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike, the scion of an elite, feudal clan that had thrived for generations with the patronage of the British Empire.         Mr. Bandaranaike made the transition from his Anglicized, upper-class background to become a populist and a nationalist. And his wife carried forward his passions with even greater decisiveness and vigor,  historians say. She was a shrewd political leader with a wide base in the Sinhalese majority.         In a recent interview, Anura, the Bandaranaike's youngest child and only son, said their father had been the affectionate, demonstrative parent while their mother was aloof.         Mrs. Bandaranaike -- known simply as Mrs. B -- served twice as  head of state, from 1960 to 1965 and again from 1970 to 1977. She nationalized many foreign and local enterprises and left Sri Lanka's economy into one that was heavily state dominated.         She also zealously pursued efforts to make Sinhalese the sole national language, a stance that deeply alienated the country's Tamil speakers. And she changed the university admissions policy to benefit the Sinhalese, disadvantaging the Tamils.         During five years of her daughter's presidency, Mrs. Bandaranaike served as prime minister, which had become a largely ceremonial role under the Constitution adopted in 1978. Increasingly feeble and unable to speak clearly, she resigned as prime minister in August, though she retained her seat in Parliament.         She lived on Rosemead Place with her elder daughter, Sunethra, a philanthropist who is 57 and never got involved in politics.         But the political family she had nurtured splintered in her later years. Her son, Anura, 51, who lives  next to his mother's home in the family compound, went over to the family's despised rival, the United National Party, after his sister, now 55, won the right to succeed their mother. But both the son, as a leader of the opposition, and the daughter, as president, have carried on the family's political tradition.       
         Anna Berenson Mayer, a social work policy planner and retired professor of social policy at Rutgers University, died on Wednesday at a New Brunswick, N.J., hospital. She was 91 and lived in East Brunswick, N.J.         Dr. Mayer, who received a doctorate in social work from Columbia University, was chosen in 1983 to head a newly formed Governor's Committee on Children's Services Planning for New Jersey. It was to make recommendations on children's issues to Gov. Thomas H. Kean.         ''We have to make sure that every child in the state has a maximum opportunity for healthy development,'' she said in an interview later that year. One obstacle she saw was inadequate welfare benefits for the poor, which, she said, made it '' very difficult to provide adequate counseling to families and their children'' who lacked ''the basic needs of food, shelter, good health care.''         She made similar observations when she delivered the panel's report to the State Legislature with the governor beside her.         She was also known as one of two co-authors of a monograph, ''Day Care as a Social Instrument,'' written for the Ford Foundation in the early 1960's. The founders of Head Start used it to help shape their program, which began in 1965.         She was born in New Orleans and taught at Columbia and New York Universities and then for a decade at the Rutgers Graduate School of Social Work.         Surviving are her husband, Nathan; a son, Steven, of Albany, Calif.; two grandchildren; and two sisters, Ruth Forsyth of New Orleans and Florence Marx of Bogalusa, La.       
         Eugenia Rawls, a theater actress who portrayed Tallulah Bankhead and others in one-woman shows, died on Nov. 8 in Denver. She was 87.         A native of Macon, Ga., Miss Rawls first took the stage at age 4 in a local production of ''Madame Butterfly,'' encouraged by her grandmother and two aunts, with whom she lived during most of her early life. After attending Wesleyan College in Macon she made her Broadway debut in 1934 in Lillian Hellman's ''Children's Hour.''         As an understudy for the actress playing Bankhead's daughter in Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' in 1939, Miss Rawls met the woman who would become her mentor and lifelong friend. ''Who are you?'' Bankhead reportedly demanded. ''You look enough like me to be my own child.'' Weeks later, Miss Rawls was playing Alexandra to Bankhead's Regina Giddens on Broadway, after which they toured 104 American cities.         Bankhead was matron of honor at Miss Rawls's 1941 wedding to Donald Seawell, a lawyer and the founder and chairman of the Denver Center for the Performing Arts, and she later became godmother to the couple's two children.         Miss Rawls performed in Lillian Smith's ''Strange Fruit''; with Jose Ferrer in ''The Shrike''; with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne in ''The Great Sebastians''; in Noel Coward's ''Private Lives''; and in Tennessee Williams's ''Glass Menagerie.''         In 1971, three years after Bankhead's death, Miss Rawls developed ''Tallulah, a Memory.'' She performed the one-woman work at Lincoln Center, which commissioned it, at the Kennedy Center and the ANTA Playhouse in Los Angeles before turning it into a book in 1979.         In 1972, Miss Rawls became the first American actress to perform at the Abbey Theater in Dublin. She also developed two other solo shows in the 1970's: ''Affectionately Yours, Fanny Kemble'' and ''Women of the West,'' and published a volume of poetry, ''A Moment Ago,'' in 1984.         In her later years, she turned to television, appearing on ''As the World Turns'' and ''The Guiding Light.'' She read the signature work of Lillian Smith in the PBS production of ''Memory of a Large Christmas,'' first broadcast in 1996.         A new theater is to be named for her at the Auraria Higher Education Center, home to the University of Colorado at Denver, Metropolitan State College and Denver Community College.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Brook Ashley of Santa Barbara, Calif.; a son, Brockman Seawell of New York; two brothers, Hubert F. Rawls Jr. of Myrtle Beach, S.C., and Richard Russell Rawls of Fernandina Beach, Fla.; a sister, Dorothy Louise Rawls Tuttle of California; a granddaughter; and two great-grandchildren.       
         Marie Windsor, who played sassy femmes fatales, cynical bawdyhouse matrons and two-timing crooks in 74 movies with enough verve to win the informal accolade ''Queen of the B's,'' died on Sunday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80.         Acting opposite male stars like Marlon Brando, George Raft, James Garner and John Wayne, she portrayed a succession of strong, but seldom admirable characters: she was the blunt, beautiful dame with the bedroom eyes who was rotten to the core and didn't care who knew it.         ''I know you like a book, ya little tramp,'' Sterling Hayden said to her in the 1956 film ''The Killing,'' directed by Stanley Kubrick.''You'd sell out your own mother for a piece of fudge.''         In ''The Narrow Margin'' (1952), she played a sexy gangster's widow who ends up riding across the country by rail with a police escort played by Charles McGraw. ''She's a dish,'' he tells his partner, ''a 60-cent special: cheap, flashy, strictly poison under the gravy.''         Later, he tells her, ''You make me sick to my stomach.''         ''Yeah?'' she snarls. ''Well, use your own sink.''         She also made guest appearances on more than 100 television shows, including ''Gunsmoke'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Her film career spanned five decades, and included film noir classics like ''Force of Evil'' (1948) and westerns like ''The Fighting Kentuckian'' (1949), with Mr. Wayne. But she also had no qualms about appearing in quickie efforts like ''Cat Women of the Moon'' (1954), ''Swamp Women'' (1955) and ''Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy'' (1955). ''I think those films added to my luster,'' she said in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. ''I think people said, 'She can even do that and survive.' ''         She came to take pride in the title Queen of the B's. As she said in several different interviews over the years, ''It's better to be queen of something than nothing at all.''         Emily Marie Bertelsen was born on Dec. 11, 1919, in Marysvale, Utah, a small farming community where her father was a mechanic. Her grandmother took her to see films with Clara Bow, the ''It Girl,'' as a child. By the time she was 11, her parents drove 30 miles over dirt roads to take her to acting lessons.         After she won two local beauty pageants and studied drama for two years at Brigham Young University, her parents drove her to Hollywood to study with Maria Ouspenskaya, the famed acting instructor. She stayed at the Hollywood Studio Club,  whose residents included Marilyn Monroe and Donna Reed. She worked as a cigarette girl at the Mocambo, a Sunset Strip nightclub.         In 1941 she made her movie debut in Paramount's ''All-American Coed,'' wearing a costume of velvet carrots. After appearing in some bit parts, she headed for New York, where she was cast in more than 400 radio shows, including a nine-month stint on the soap opera ''Our Gal Sunday,'' from 1943 to 1945. During her last year in New York, she played the femme heavy in the Broadway play ''Follow the Girls.''         MGM then signed her to a contract, though she did lesser roles for many other studios, including some very small ones, through the 1950's.         ''A lot of things hampered my career,'' she said in an interview with The San Francisco Chronicle in 1994. ''At 5 foot 9, I was too tall for most leading men. And I never had a classic face. One of my casting directors at Paramount said about me, before I'd even started my career, 'Her eyes are too big and she has a bad mouth.' ''         The Chronicle quoted Frances Bergen, the mother of Candice and a long-time friend, as suggesting that Ms. Windsor's striking resemblance to Joan Crawford might have obscured her during Crawford's heyday. But Ms. Windsor found a niche in film noir, a genre of mainly crime thrillers that captured a sense of postwar disillusionment. In ''Force of Evil,'' she played Roy Roberts's sultry, promiscuous wife in a tale about the numbers racket. For the first time, she received featured billing and was pictured in the advertising. She once said in an interview: ''I didn't know I was doing film noir, I thought they were detective stories with low lighting! Even Kubrick, in  'The Killing,' never used the term film noir to my knowledge.''         Perhaps her best remembered role was in the low-budget ''The Narrow Margin,'' in which she played a sexy gangster's wife with a heart of gravel. That role spurred Kubrick to cast her as an unfaithful wife in ''The Killing,'' for which she won the best supporting actress award from Look.         ''One of the reasons film noir is so popular today is that it left so much to the imagination, in contrast to today when everything is so explicit,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times last year. ''Film noir engaged the audience, let them use the gray matter between their ears.''         Ms. Windsor is survived by her husband, Jack Rodney Hupp; her son, Richard Hupp; a brother, Jerry Bertelsen; and a sister, Louise Atherley.         She was a director of the Screen Actors Guild for 25 years, and was aligned with the union's conservative wing, represented by Ronald Reagan and Charlton Heston. But many conservative movie viewers might be hard pressed to believe it. Her characters were just so radically evil.         She told Classic Images, a film magazine: ''Fans would send me Bibles with specific verses underscored and accompanied by handwritten warnings that 'the devil would get me and I'd go to hell,' if I didn't reform.''       
         Ilona Karmel Zucker, a Holocaust survivor who based much of her writing on her experiences in Nazi labor camps, died on Nov. 30 in Cambridge, Mass. She was 75.         Born in Krakow, Poland, Ms. Karmel endured the war years in the city's ghetto and in three nearby camps, where she composed her first literary work, ''Songs From Behind the Barbed Wire,'' a collection of poems written secretly on the backs of worksheets.         At Buchenwald, the last of the camps, both of her legs were crushed by a tank. During two years of postwar convalescence in a Swedish hospital, she learned to walk again and taught herself English by correspondence with Oxford University. She then immigrated to the United States in 1948, attending Hunter College before graduating Phi Beta Kappa from Radcliffe College, where she was a protegee of the poet Archibald MacLeish.         She began her career as a short-story writer, winning the Mademoiselle College Fiction Prize in 1951 for ''Fru Holm.'' Her first novel, ''Stephania,'' completed while she was at Radcliffe and published in 1953, drew on her experiences in Sweden.         Her 1969 novel, ''An Estate of Memory,'' based on life in a Polish camp and centering on four prisoners who conspire to save the life of a child, is considered by scholars to be among the most resonant accounts of the Holocaust.         A review in The New York Times called it ''a very good book,'' adding that ''like Solzhenitsyn, Ilona Karmel has succeeded in writing about life in the prison camps'' as ''plausible, possible human experience.''         The work, translated into German in 1997, was recently reissued in paperback.         While pursuing her writing, Ms. Karmel taught in day care schools in a career that spanned a 10-year stay in Germany, where she worked in an orphanage.         On returning to the United States in 1978 with her husband, the physicist and philosopher Francis Zucker, she was appointed to a senior lectureship in the writing program at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she remained until her retirement in 1995.         In 1995 M.I.T. named the Ilona Karmel Writing Prizes in her honor.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Libertad Lamarque Bouza, a singer and actress whose career ranged from the gritty days of early tango recordings in Argentina to the contemporary daily soap operas produced for mass audiences in the Spanish-speaking world, died on Dec. 12 in Mexico City. She was 92.         Ms. Lamarque gained renown after leaving Argentina for Mexico in 1946, following an incident on the Buenos Aires set of the 1944 movie ''The Circus Procession.'' She was said to have quarreled with a young actress named Eva Duarte.         The next year Duarte married Col. Juan Domingo Peron, and in 1946, Peron became president of Argentina. Exercising her power as first lady, Eva Duarte Peron effectively prevented any studio in Argentina from hiring Ms. Lamarque.         After she moved to Mexico City in the 1940's, during the Golden Age of Mexican cinema, Ms. Lamarque's career blossomed. She acted in the first film that the Spanish director Luis Bunuel made in Mexico, ''The Great Casino,'' and appeared in some 60 other films.         ''Strangely, even with a strong Argentine accent that never quite went away, she became the darling of Mexican cinema,'' said Carl Mora, an expert on Latin American film at the University of New Mexico. ''Her magnetic presence made for quite a life trajectory.''         It was in Rosario, the provincial Argentine city where Ms. Lamarque was born, that she began her artistic career. Her father was Gaudencio Lamarque, a Uruguayan descendant of French immigrants and a militant anarchist. Because he was imprisoned at the time of her birth, his daughter was named Libertad, or Liberty. Together with six half-brothers and -sisters, she began acting as a child in plays inspired by anarchist ideas.         In 1926, when Ms. Lamarque turned 18, her family moved to Buenos Aires. She soon found work singing in comedy shows. Then a music studio hired her to record tango songs, and she began to attract attention. Ms. Lamarque also started acting, making her debut in the 1929 silent film ''Adios, Argentina,'' which was made by the Italian director Mario Parpagnoli in a single day. In 1932 she starred in ''Tango,'' Argentina's first sound film.         Ms. Lamarque's first marriage, to Emilio Romero, who worked as a prompter in the theater, turned sour shortly after they exchanged vows in 1928. Still, because divorce was illegal at the time in Argentina, it took Ms. Lamarque 12 years to become legally separated from him.         In 1935 she was reported to have attempted suicide while on tour in Chile. That same year her husband took their daughter, Mirtha, with him to live in neighboring Uruguay. After an effort involving a lawyer and several friends, including Hector Artola, her new romantic partner and future husband, Ms. Lamarque succeeded in gaining custody of her daughter.         While in Argentina, Ms. Lamarque acted in more than 20 movies, including ''Honeysuckle,'' ''When I Return to Your Side'' and ''In This Gray Afternoon.'' But it was in Mexico that she took her place as a leading figure in Latin American cinema, and later in the melodramatic world of daily telenovelas, or soap operas. In later years she divided her time between Mexico City and Miami, but refused to retire.         Earlier this year the Mexican Academy of Cinema Arts and Sciences awarded her a lifetime achievement award. At the time of her death she was playing a Mother Superior in ''Angelface,'' a popular telenovela.         Ms. Lamarque is survived by her daughter, Mirtha Romero Lamarque, of Argentina.       
         Emily Wilkens, an award-winning fashion designer who rejected the idea that young girls should be dressed as if they were their mothers in miniature, died in the Bronx on Saturday. She was 83.         Beginning in the early 1940's and drawing on references as diverse as Russian peasant dresses, mid-19th-century pinafores and the paintings of Thomas Gainsborough, Ms. Wilkens designed clothes for preteen and teenage girls that belied the formality and fussiness apparel makers had tended to force upon them.         ''She was the first to really recognize that this was a growth area,'' the fashion publicist Eleanor Lambert said.         Ms. Wilkens's sensibility ran toward the unconstricted; even her party dresses were made of washable cottons. With developing adolescent figures in mind, her dresses featured adjustable waistlines; her full skirts allowed for widening hips.         In a 1944 collection produced for Bonwit Teller, she surprised her audience by using black in dresses for teenage girls. But, as The New York Times wrote at the time, ''Black that no mother could object to, for it was made with snug bodice and as full a dirndl as the law permits.''         The fashion historian Richard Martin once wrote, ''Long before rock 'n' roll and James Dean movies, Emily Wilkens invented the American teenager, pegging her sensibility to young, playful, energetic women.''         Ms. Wilkens came to the world of children's wear rather by accident. While vacationing in Hollywood in the early 1940's, Ms. Wilkens, then an illustrator, was erroneously introduced at a party as a children's fashion designer. Soon after, she was asked to design a wardrobe for Ann Todd, a child star, who needed to be outfitted for a new movie. As a result, Ms. Wilkens began designing clothes for the progeny of celebrities like Jack Benny and Gracie Allen.         Born in Hartford in 1917, Ms. Wilkens studied fashion illustration at Pratt Institute. After graduating in 1938, she began sketching dresses for department store newspaper advertisements. She married Judge Irving L. Levey in 1947.         By 1948, Ms. Wilkens had started a concomitant career as a writer with the book ''Here's Looking at You: The Modern Slant on Smartness for the Junior Miss.'' She wrote four more books on beauty and grooming and served as a trustee of the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York from 1966 to 1976.         After receiving a diagnosis of dementia nine years ago, Ms. Wilkens was moved to the Hebrew Home for the Aged in Riverdale in 1991, where she died. She is survived by a daughter, Jane Wilkens Michael, a son, Hugh Levey, and five grandchildren.
