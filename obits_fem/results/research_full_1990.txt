        Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan.         Lola L. Szladits, the renowned curator of the New York Public Library's Berg Collection of English and American Literature, who expanded the collection to include original manuscripts that ranged from W. B. Yeats to S. J. Perelman and Saul Bellow, died of cancer Friday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 67 years old.         During her 20 years as curator, Dr. Szladits scoured England to bargain for diaries and first editions; in this country, she cajoled American authors to think of the Berg first when parting with their papers. In the faintly discernible accent of her native Hungary, she was fond of joking, though without affectation, ''Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets.''         Everyone from the president of the library to her assistants called Dr. Szladits by her first name. She, in turn, was on a first-name basis with her precious manuscripts. When she spoke of ''Tom,'' she meant T. S. Eliot, of ''Wystan,'' W. H. Auden, and of ''Virginia,'' her greatly admired diarist and novelist, Virginia Woolf.         Sitting in her cramped office off the Berg's reading and exhibition rooms on the third floor of the library on Fifth Avenue at 42d Street, Dr. Szladits liked to reach for the exact quotation from one of the tens of thousands of documents in the collection.         'We Protect the Written Word'         Last year, when she mounted a show on diarists, it included 50 of her famous authors, including James Boswell, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Herman Melville and, of course, Virginia Woolf, whose manuscripts in 33 volumes are one of the prizes in the Berg. She liked to quote ''Virginia,'' who said, ''Fortunately, intellect has no gender.''         Dr. Szladits considered the Berg not a musty repository of the past but a working collection that was used by biographers from all over the world.         ''We protect the written word at the Berg,'' she told Whitney Balliett, who wrote a profile about her in The New Yorker on Dec. 31, 1984 - the first such article about a librarian in the magazine's history. ''It is a research collection, not a museum. It has to be used. It is alive. My role at the Berg is to stand still and allow the collection to grow. In fact, I try to make time itself stand still here. I try to create quiet and the timelessness that allows for the pursuit of truth.''         Auden's Handwritten Notebooks         Born in Budapest, she immigrated to the United States in 1950 and became a naturalized citizen in 1956. After receiving her doctorate in Hungary, she did postgraduate work at the Sorbonne in Paris, University College in London and Columbia University. She joined the New York Public Library in 1955 and was appointed curator of the Berg Collection in 1969.         Among her most significant acquisitions were Auden's handwritten notebooks. She also established or expanded files on Conrad Aiken, H. G. Wells, Muriel Rukeyser, Evelyn Waugh, Samuel Beckett, William Faulkner, May Sarton, Washington Irving, Walt Whitman and Oliver Wendell Holmes.         ''I am buying in eternity,'' Dr. Szladits once remarked.         Paul Fasana, the library's Andrew W. Mellon Director of Research Libraries, said yesterday: ''Lola was an original. Her standards, for herself and others, were high and at times unattainable. Her dedication to the ideal of literary scholarship was fierce. But she was also loving and human.''         Dr. Szladits was married to Charles Szladits, a professor of law at Columbia University, who died in 1986.         A memorial service will be held on May 5 in the Celeste Bartos Forum of the library, and a book fund in her name will be established for the Berg Collection.       
        Charlotte Boschan, an economist who established the first electronic data bank in the field when she was associated with the National Bureau of Economic Research a quarter-century ago, died of complications of surgery on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70 years old and lived in New City, N         Charlotte Boschan, an economist who established the first electronic data bank in the field when she was associated with the National Bureau of Economic Research a quarter-century ago, died of complications of surgery on Thursday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70 years old and lived in New City, N.Y.         Dr. Boschan, who was born in Frankfurt-am-Main, Germany, received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's and a doctorate from Columbia University. After working at the Econometric Institute she joined the National Bureau in 1951 and was an early developer of data banks.         At the bureau she helped revise the cyclical economic indicators used by the United States Department of Commerce and the procedure for combining the indicators into indexes of economic activity. She was also largely responsible for constructing the Growth Cycle Program, a method of determining turning points in the economy.         From 1977 to 1986 Dr. Boschan was a vice president of Citibank, which took over the economic data bank, now known as Citibase, from the National Bureau.         Her husband, Paul Boschan, a statistician, died in 1986.         She is survived by a brother, Beretz Ronen of Kibbutz Hazorea, Israel.       
        Edwina Dumm, a syndicated newspaper cartoonist, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         Edwina Dumm, a syndicated newspaper cartoonist, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96 years old.         Miss Dumm began her career in 1915 as an editorial cartoonist for The Columbus (Ohio) Monitor, which has since gone out of business. Lucy Caswell, of the Cartoon, Graphic and Photographic Arts Research Library of Ohio State University, said Miss Dumm was the first woman in the country to work full time as an editorial cartoonist.         In 1917 Miss Dumm moved to Manhattan and continued her career under the name Edwina, with a comic strip called ''Cap. Stubbs.'' It was distributed by the George Matthew Adams Syndicate, which went out of business in the 1940's.         ''Tippy,'' a dog, entered the strip in the 1930's, which was then distributed by King Features under both titles.         Miss Dumm, a native of Upper Sandusky, Ohio, retired in 1966, and the comic strip ended.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Nina Hyde, the fashion editor of The Washington Post and a pacesetter in the fields of style and fashion, died Friday night after a long bout with breast cancer at the Georgetown University Hospital in Washington. She was 57 years old and lived in Washington.         Since Mrs. Hyde was found to have cancer five years ago, she worked ardently to call attention to the disease, raising nearly $2 million for Georgetown University Medical Center, which established the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research last year.         In March she organized a benefit at the new Chanel boutique at the Willard Hotel in Washington for which 350 people paid $350 a ticket. The evening raised more than $50,000 for the Nina Hyde Center and an equal amount for Look Good . . . Feel Better, a separate counseling program that helps women after chemotherapy and radiation treatments.         As a reporter, Mrs. Hyde was known for covering fashion as intently as if she were covering a war, searching for the sociological significance of such trends as the development of the punk style in London.         Style of Protest Movement         Her article on that phenomenon helped draw attention at the end of the 1970's to the protest movement among the young. It also helped alert retailers to the London street scene.         She traveled through Europe and the Far East for exhaustive studies of the history of silk and of wool, with her analysis appearing in National Geographic. She was also noted for her ''Ins and Outs'' column on New Year's Day, which covered political and social trends as well as fashion.         She also conducted a lecture series at the Smithsonian Institution, with guests like the designers Issey Miyake, Norma Kamali and Sonia Rykiel.         But she was not averse to offering mundane, sensible advice to women on how to dress. Short skirts look younger than long ones, she believed. Classic shapes are good investments, she said. She advised her readers to buy clothes on sale and at discount. She herself usually wore black dresses and very little makeup.         The daughter of Dr. Harry A. Solomon, an internist, and his wife, Ruth, she was born in Manhattan and graduated from Smith College. One of two women accepted at the time for New York University's Law School, she dropped out to work for McCann-Erickson, the advertising agency, and the Maidenform Brassiere Company. Later she joined Women's Wear Daily as the corset and brassiere editor. In 1961, after marrying Lloyd Hyde, a real estate developer, she moved to Washington where she wrote a column, ''Hyde & Chic,'' for The Washington Daily News. After that newspaper's demise she joined The Washington Post, in 1972.         Celebrities Honor Writer         In 1986, when the Fashion Group decided to honor her at a formal dinner raising money for the group's' scholarship fund, she insisted that some proceeds go toward AIDS research. More than 800 people paid $150 to attend, including fashion designers like Bill Blass, Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren from New York, Carla Fendi and Rosita Missoni from Italy and Jacqueline de Ribes and Thierry Mugler from Paris.         Fashion designers have been major contributors to the Nina Hyde Center for Breast Cancer Research. Mr. Lauren was host at a cocktail party two years ago and donated $100,000 to get the fund started. Other supporters include Oscar de la Renta, Calvin Klein, Donna Karan, Issey Miyake, Christian Lacroix and Yves Saint Laurent and the Chanel company.         Mrs. Hyde received the Eugenia Sheppard Award for outstanding fashion reporting by the Council of Fashion Designers of America in 1988 and she was made a Chevalier des Artes et Lettres in Paris last October.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Jennifer, of Washington, and Andrea, of San Francisco; her mother, Ruth Solomon of New York; a brother, Howard Solomon of Bethesda, Md., and a sister, Marquise Sue de Brantes, of St. Armand Lepypre, France.         The funeral will be held at 11 A.M. Monday at the Washington Hebrew Congregation at Macomb Street and Massachusetts Avenue.

She was 94 years old and lived in Walnut Creek, Calif.         Grace Lee Nute, a historian and educator who was a retired research associate at the Minnesota Historical Society, died May 4 at a nursing home in Menlo Park, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Walnut Creek, Calif.         Miss Nute began her career as curator of the Minnesota Historical Society's manuscript collection in 1921, after earning a Ph.D. in American history at Harvard University. She was among the first to use microfilm to preserve manuscripts and make them more accessible to scholars. From 1946 until her retirement in 1957, Dr. Nute was a research associate at the society.         She wrote many books and articles about Minnesota fur traders and explorers, including ''The Voyageur'' and ''Caesars of the Wilderness.'' She was also a professor of history at Hamline University in St. Paul from 1927 to 1960 and a visiting professor at Macalester College.         Her closest survivors are several nieces and nephews.

She was 55 years old.         Dr. Ora M. Rosen, a research scientist who was a leading investigator of the ways hormones and other factors control the development of cells, died of breast cancer yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 55 years old.         Dr. Rosen held the Abby Rockefeller Mauze Chair of Experimental Therapeutics at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center and, as an American Cancer Society research professor, headed the center's laboratory of developmental and membrane biology.         In 1985 Dr. Rosen and colleagues at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, in collaboration with scientists at Genentech Inc., achieved a breakthrough in cell biology by cloning the gene for the human insulin receptor, the cell surface molecule to which insulin binds.         By accomplishing the cloning they opened the way for detailed investigation of how the insulin receptor transmits signals from the surface of the cell to the interior. More recently Dr. Rosen and her associates had been applying a wide range of biochemical and genetic techniques to determine how the receptor molecule gets its message to the cell's metabolic machinery.         Broader Look Into Insulin's Role         Their work also led to a broader inquiry into the role of insulin in normal cell function and in diabetes and other disorders.         Dr. Rosen, who was born in Manhattan, received an M.D. degree from the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. After studying cell biology and biochemistry at New York University and at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine, she joined the faculty at Einstein in 1966 and became chairwoman of the molecular pharmacology department. She joined the staff of Memorial Sloan-Kettering in 1984.         Last year Dr. Rosen was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jerard Hurwitz, also an American Cancer Society research professor at Sloan-Kettering; two sons, Isaac, of Manhattan, and Gideon, of Ann Arbor, Mich., and a brother, Ezra Mendelsohn of Jerusalem.

From 1930 to 1956, except for two years in World War II, Dr. Weeks was a professor and head of the physics department at Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa. For six years after her retirement from Wilson she coordinated a program at the United States Army's arsenal at Watertown, Mass., that developed radiological shielding materials for use against nuclear weapons, neutrons and gamma rays.         Leaving the Army's Materials Research Agency in 1964, she became a spectroscopist, studying solar satellites at the Harvard College Observatory. She retired in 1976 at the age of 83.         Dr. Weeks, a native of Philadelphia and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Wellesley College, went to work in 1917 as an assistant examiner for the United States Patent Office and, concurrently, an assistant at the National Bureau of Standards. From 1920 to 1924, while studying and teaching physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she earned her master's degree.         In 1924 she began a new, if short-lived, career in retailing. Obtaining a second master's degree, from the Prince School of Business at Simmons College, she became an employment supervisor for Jordan Marsh, the Boston department store.         In 1928 she returned to academic life, teaching physics at Wellesley while earning her Ph.D. in mathematics at M.I.T. in 1930. She was the first woman to earn a mathematics Ph.D. at the university.         From 1943 to 1945, on leave from Wilson College, she was a technical aide at the Federal Government's Office of Scientific Research and Development. In 1949 and 1950, back at Wilson, she was a Guggenheim Fellow.         Dr. Weeks is survived by a sister, Ruth Davis of Washington.
