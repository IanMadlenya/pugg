         Dora R. Inselbuch, a longtime national board member of Hadassah, the women's Zionist and charitable organization, died on Thursday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale. She was 93 years old and had lived in Manhattan until eight years ago.         Her family said she died of natural causes in her sleep.         During her 16 years on the national board, Mrs. Inselbuch served in several capacities. In the 1940's, she was chairman of the Jewish National Fund department, Hadassah's official Zionist land-buying agency in what was then Palestine. The fund raised money for colonization and land-reclamation work, including reforestation.         She also was a past national Hadassah chairman for young people pioneering in Palestine and helped found Kibbutz Hasollelim to train young Zionists. It remains an operating kibbutz today in Israel. Daughter of a Rabbi         Mrs. Inselbuch, the daughter of a rabbi, was born in Vilnius, Lithuania, then part of czarist Russia. She came to the United States as a 5-year-old and grew up in Denver.         While attending Hunter College, she became one of the first recipients of a Hebrew teacher's certificate from the Teachers Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary. As Jewish education chairman for Hadassah, she later was an organizer of the seminary's School for Jewish Women.         Mrs. Inselbuch began her community work as a leader in Young Judaea, the national Zionist youth movement supported by Hadassah. She was a past vice president of the Brooklyn and New York chapters of Hadassah and founder of its Jersey City chapter. She also was a founding member of the Society for the Advancement of Judaism in New York.         She is survived by two daughters, Hadassah Tannor of Manhattan and Froma Zeitlin of Princeton, N.J.; six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Bettina Louise Chow, an internationally acclaimed model, restaurateur, jewelry designer, sculptor and fashion collector, died on Friday at her home in Pacific Palisades, Calif. She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said. She worked with AIDS organizations and talked openly of her illness, which she attributed to heterosexual transmission.         Mrs. Chow, known professionally as Tina Chow, began her career at the age of 16, modeling for Shiseido, a leading cosmetics company in Japan. Soon she found herself working at fashion shows and for photographers, appearing on major magazine covers and in pictures for advertisements and fashion news articles. She was a favorite model of Cecil Beaton, among other photographers.         In the early 1970's, she married Michael Chow and worked with him in running his Mr. Chow restaurant in London, a fashionable restaurant featuring Peking cuisine. Later they moved to Manhattan, opening a branch of the restaurant on 57th Street, and then to California to create a third branch in Beverly Hills. Crystals on Cords         She began designing jewelry in the mid-1980's and was a trendsetter for her use of quartz and other crystals as amulets and rings in a variety of settings and as pendants on silk cords. She had outlets in leading stores in several cities, including in Manhattan at Bergdorf Goodman on Fifth Avenue and at the Ted Muehling Shop in SoHo.         More recently she had shifted into abstract and organic sculpture in crystal and furniture design.         Regularly listed as one of the best-dressed women, she acquired a large collection of designer clothes and patterns, part of which is to be shown at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan starting March 16. Rizzoli Publishing is working on a book on the collection.         She remained professionally active while fighting her illness and worked with Angel Food, an organization that delivers food to AIDS patients.         Mrs. Chow was born in Lakeview, Ohio. As a teen-ager she moved with her family to Tokyo, where her father, Walter Edmund Lutz, worked in international trade. Mrs. Chow was educated at Sophia University in Tokyo.         She was divorced from Mr. Chow. She is survived by her parents, Mr. Lutz and Mona Furuki, who now live in Los Angeles; a son, Maximillian, and a daughter, China, both of Pacific Palisades, and a sister, Adelle Lutz of Manhattan, who is the wife of the rock musician David Byrne.

She was 41 years old.         Her death resulted from complications of AIDS, her family said.

         Wanda Mary Jablonski, an expert on the international oil industry and founder of the Petroleum Intelligence Weekly newsletter, died on Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 71 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, said Edward L. Morse, the newsletter's publisher.         Ms. Jablonski's career began when she landed a big story in 1945 while still an office messenger at the Journal of Commerce in Manhattan. Filling in for the oil reporter and assigned to cover a news conference conducted by a Venezuelan official, she waited until the session ended to corner him for a private interview. In the interview, he disclosed plans to seize and nationalize all foreign oil operations in Venezuela. He also called for joint action by developing countries with oil reserves, an idea that culminated in the formation of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries in 1960. Savoir-Faire Was Helpful         Ms. Jablonski became the Journal's oil editor and "the most influentual oil journalist of her time," as Daniel Yergin wrote in his history of the oil business, "The Prize" (Simon & Schuster, 1990). He added that she had the "savoir-faire required to get her through all sorts of situations."         Making her way in a male-dominated industry, she befriended Texas wildcatters, Arab sheiks, corporate executives and important government figures around the globe. She traveled often, once spending six months in the desert; on a visit to Saudi Arabia, she found herself housed in the guest quarters of the king's harem.         McGraw-Hill hired her in 1954 as senior editor of its new Petroleum Week, but the magazine folded in 1961. Jobless, she founded her own weekly, which was 8 to 12 pages and printed on yellow paper. It grew steadily to a circulation in the thousands, despite an annual subscription fee in the hundreds of dollars. The current price is $1,375.         Her newsletter became required reading in the industry for information on explorations, refining, supplies, prices and political trends. The readership ranged from Central Intelligence Agency officials to Middle East rulers. Her early reports on oil company plans occasionally enraged executives, who sometimes temporarily canceled their subscriptions in protest. She sold the weekly in 1988 to the Petroleum Intelligence Group. Born in Czechoslovakia         Ms. Jablonski was born in Czechoslovakia. Her mother was a physicist; her father, Eugene, worked for the Socony Oil Company, and the family followed him around the world to England, Egypt, Mexico, New Zealand, Texas, Europe and Morocco.         After settling in the United States in 1938, Ms. Jablonski earned a bachelor's degree from Cornell University in 1942 and a master's in journalism from Columbia University in 1943.         In recent years she worked for the Strang Cancer Prevention Center in Manhattan as the director of the National High-Risk Registry for women with a family history of breast cancer. She donated $3 million to the center.         She was married and divorced three times. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Marion F. Schappel, a retired vice president at Citibank and one of the first women there to reach that rank, died on Wednesday at her home in Somers, N.Y. She was 67 years old.         She died of complications of cancer, her family said.         Miss Schappel was born in Brooklyn and grew up in Mahwah, N.J. She started at Citibank when she was 18, after graduation from high school. Her first job was as a page. She worked her way up to become secretary to a branch manager. After years of experience, she often found herself explaining procedures to younger male executive trainees.         In 1961 she was promoted to assistant manager, only the third woman in the bank's 151-year history to hold such a post. By 1964 there were a dozen female assistant managers and she was chosen from them to study at the Stonier Graduate School of Banking at Rutgers University. She and 22 other students from other banks that year were the first women admitted at Stonier.         In 1965 she was one of four women promoted to assistant vice president at Citibank and in 1972 became a vice president. Most of her work was in branch banking. She spent 22 years in the branch at the bank's headquarters at 399 Park Avenue in Manhattan and became its manager. She was also manager of the branch in the Pan Am Building. She retired from full-time work in 1987 but continued as a consultant to the bank for three years.         Surviving are two brothers, Robert B. of Pasco, Wash., and Richard B. of Oak Ridge, Tenn.       
         Mary Osborne, one of the few women to gain jazz stardom as a guitarist and the first woman to play the electric guitar professionally, died on Wednesday at Mercy Hospital in Bakersfield, Calif. She was 70 years old.         She died of liver failure as a result of cancer, said her son Ralph Scaffidi Jr.         Both her parents were guitarists, and Ms. Osborne -- whose family name was Orsborn -- became fascinated by stringed instruments as a child. She began playing the ukulele when she was 4 and at 10 she joined a string band led by her father in which she played banjo. She had started playing guitar a year earlier, and while she was in grammar school she was playing jazz violin. 'The Most Startling Thing'         She sang and played guitar in her hometown, Bismarck, N.D., in her teen-age years. When she was 17 some fellow musicians urged her to hear the Al Trent Sextet, which was playing a one-night stand in Bismark. One musician played an instrument she had never seen or heard before: an electric guitar. The guitarist was Charlie Christian.         "The only electric guitar I knew of was the Hawaiian guitar," she said. "I'd listen to all the jazz guitarists of the time, but they all played acoustic. But here was Charlie Christian playing Django Reinhardt's 'St. Louis Blues' note for note but with an electric guitar. It was the most startling thing I'd ever heard."         The next day, she found a guitar like Christian's. It cost $85; for $45, a friend built an amplifier for her. From then on, she was an electric guitarist.         She went on the road with an all-female trio. When they played St. Louis, Buddy Rogers, the movie star-turned-band leader, heard them and added them to his band. The Rogers band broke up when it reached New York, but Ms. Osborne quickly got jobs at radio stations and recording studios and joined in jam sessions in clubs on West 52d Street. She eventually formed her own trio.         With her husband, Ralph Scaffidi, a trumpet player, she moved to Bakersfield in 1968 where they formed and ran the Osborne Guitar Company, which later became the Osborne Sound Laboratories, a manufacturer of amplifiers and public-address systems. She appeared at the Kool Jazz Festival in New York in 1981 and played at the Village Vanguard two years ago.         In addition to her son, who lives in Bakersfield, she is survived by her husband, another son, Peter, of Clovis, N.M.; a daughter, Susan Chidgey of Bakersfield; a brother, Elvy Orsborn, and a sister, Louise Orsborn.       
         Harriet Mandelbaum, who spent decades of her life working in behalf of autistic and other mentally impaired children, died on Thursday at Caledonian Hospital in Brooklyn. She was 79 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         Her family said a cerebral hemorrhage caused her death.         She was active both in her community and on the national level. A member of the United States Joint Commission on Mental Health for Children, she toured the country to speak about the special needs of such children. In 1951, she helped found the League for Emotionally Disturbed Children, which was dedicated to promoting educational and therapeutic facilities.         The league became the National Organization for Mentally Ill Children in 1955, and Mrs. Mandelbaum was its first president. For many years, she was involved in the growth of the League Treatment Center, for both children and adults, in Brooklyn, and of the League School. She was the first head of the school's board after it was founded in 1953.         Mrs. Mandelbaum is survived by her husband, Dr. Joseph Mandelbaum, himself a past president of the League School; two sons, Paul Mandelbaum, of Brooklyn, and Dr. Joel Mandelbaum, of Kingston, N.Y.; a daughter, Jo Travis, of Branchville, N.J., and two grandchildren.       
         Rixi Markus, the first woman to be named a grandmaster of bridge, died on Saturday in London. She was 81 years old.         Mrs. Markus had suffered a heart attack.         She was a winner of many national, international and world bridge titles and an organizer of matches, the editor of a bridge column and the author of eight books on the game.         Mrs. Markus, who changed her name to Rixi, was born Erika Scharfstein in 1910 in Gura Humorului, a town in Bukovina that is now part of northern Romania. She moved to Vienna at an early age and learned to play whist when she was 12 years old.         A decade later she became a star in the new game of contract bridge. She was the youngest member of the Austrian women's team that won the European title in 1935 and 1936 and the world title in 1937.         She married Salomon Markus, a businessman, in 1929 and a daughter, Margot, was born the following year. The marriage later ended in divorce in 1947.         On the day Hitler's forces entered Austria in 1938, Mrs. Markus left by train with her daughter and reached England, where she lived for the rest of her life. In 1951 she returned to international competition as a member of the British women's team and won another European Women's Championship, a triumph she was to repeat six more times.         Many of her successes were as a partner of Fritzi Gordon, another refugee from Austria, who died two months ago. They won the first World Women's Pairs Championship in Cannes, France, in 1962, and repeated that success in Las Palmas in the Canary Islands in 1974, a double achievement that has never been matched.         In 1974 Mrs. Markus became the first woman ever to be named grandmaster by the World Bridge Federation, and she was the world's top-ranked player among women for the next six years. She won another title at the World Team Olympiad in New York in 1964.         Her most renowned achievement was a 1961 victory in Britain's premier bridge event, the Gold Cup, an event that few women have won.         Mrs. Markus became the target of controversy when she supported two British players, Terence Reese and Boris Schapiro, who had been found guilty of cheating by the World Bridge Federation in the 1965 World Team Championships in Buenos Aires.         In an article in Bridge World, she wrote that the British captain, Ralph Swimer, had failed in his duties, and he sued her for libel. The suit ended in 1969 after a High Court jury was unable to agree on a verdict.         Mrs. Markus wrote eight books about bridge in addition to her autobiography, "A Vulnerable Game," published in London in 1988. She was the bridge editor of The Guardian in Britain from 1955 until her death.         She was also the chief organizer of the annual bridge matches between the House of Lords and the House of Commons. In 1975 Queen Elizabeth II named her a Member, Order of the British Empire, for services to bridge.         Mrs. Markus had no surviving relatives. Her daughter died in Los Angeles in 1976.       
         Susan N. Brewster, the executive director of the State Financial Control Board for the City of Yonkers for the last six years, died on Tuesday at the Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 41 years old and lived in Ossining.         She died of complications of leukemia, her husband, Charles Eisenmann, said.         Mrs. Brewster helped stabilize Yonkers's municipal finances during a period of budgetary strain and turbulence over millions of dollars in fines that a Federal judge threatened to impose on the city to pressure compliance on housing desegregation.         She outlined what was called a doomsday budget, which warned that if the case was not resolved, the city would be forced to dismantle services to pay the fines. After some fines were collected, officials reached a settlement with the court.         Born in London, Mrs. Brewster grew up in Ossining. After graduating from Brown University, she earned a master's degree in business administration at Columbia.         She started as a financial aide in the Ossining urban renewal agency, then worked for the New York City Office of Management and Budget. She became director of the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act program in Fairfield County, Conn., then was appointed the Private Industry Council's deputy director for southern Connecticut. She joined the Yonkers control board as deputy director.         Mrs. Brewster helped found Job's Refuge, a homeless shelter in Ossining.  She served on the board of the Open Door Family Health Clinic in Ossining, was a deacon for Briarcliff Congregational Church and was president of the Inter-Faith Council for Action, a housing preservation organization.         Surviving are her husband of eight years; their daughter, Catherine Eisenmann; her mother, Barbara Brewster of Ossining; and three sisters, Deborah Ferrenz of Silver Spring, Md., Abigail McGahey of Tyngsboro, Mass., and Alison Henderson of North Andover, Mass.       
         Sari Dienes, an artist whose career spanned many different media and several decades of the New York art world, died on Monday at her home in Stony Point, N.Y. She was 93 years old.         She died of cancer, said Rip Hayman, a friend and the curator of the Sari Dienes Foundation.         Mrs. Dienes, whose original name was Chylinska von Daivitz, was born in Hungary in 1898 and in her youth studied dance, music and philosophy. She was married at the age of 19 to a French mathematician, Paul Dienes, and she did not decide to become an artist until she was 29 and living in Wales with her husband. Over the next decade, she studied art in Paris and London with Ferdinand Leger, Andre Lhote and Henry Moore. Stranded in New York at the outbreak of World War II, she made the city her home, supporting herself by teaching art.  'Nothing Is So Humble'         As an artist, Mrs. Dienes had an innately experimental approach to materials and techniques and a lasting faith in the power of the found object. "Bones, lint, Styrofoam, banana skins, the squishes and squashes found on the street: nothing is so humble that it cannot be made into art," she once said, and her work tended to prove her right.         During her career she made elaborate rubbings of American Indian petroglyphs and New York City manhole covers, created assemblages out of bones and sundry other materials, painted Abstract Expressionist drip paintings and turned her studio-house in Stony Point, in Rockland County, into a walk-in art environment. When her 57th Street studio burned in 1957, Mrs. Dienes spent two years in Japan studying with a master potter, and thereafter added ceramics to her repertory.         Throughout her career, Mrs. Dienes was a more or less visible fixture on the postwar New York art scene, distinguished in later years by her round, beatific face and halo of frizzy white hair. In the 1950's she exhibited at the Betty Parsons Gallery, a prominent showplace for the Abstract Expressionists, but her work was more in the neo-Dada spirit of younger artists like Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg and the composer John Cage, who were her friends.  Influence of Encouragement         In a short reminiscence that appears in a catalogue for an exhibition of Mrs. Dienes's work that is touring Europe, the art dealer Leo Castelli says that in the 1950's, Mrs. Dienes "was very encouraging to the younger artists and gave their new work her seal of approval."         "In this way she exerted a real influence," he adds.         He also notes that Mrs. Dienes gave Mr. Rauschenberg the large stuffed eagle he used in "Canyon," one of his most famous combine paintings.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Dienes became an early member of A.I.R., the first women's cooperative art gallery in the United States. Her most recent exhibition at A.I.R., a retrospective that closed last month, included a number of Styrofoam prints and paintings that the artist made in the 1980's. In her later years she was also the principal owner of the Ear Inn, a bar on Spring Street west of SoHo known for its new music and performance programs.         Mrs. Dienes's husband died in London in 1955. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Cathy E. Bennett, who pioneered new strategies for picking and persuading juries, died Tuesday at her home in Galveston, Tex. She was 41 years old.         She died of breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bennett was considered the nation's leading authority on jury selection. Last year the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers gave her a lifetime achievement award.         Morris Dees, a lawyer with the Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., with whom she worked on several prominent cases, said, "If Rosa Parks was the mother of the civil rights movement, Cat Bennett is the mother of modern criminal law practice in America."         As a consultant in 850 civil and criminal cases she helped lawyers select jurors, and she promoted her approach in articles, speeches, seminars and courses at the National Criminal Defense College in Macon, Ga.         In her last famous case, she assisted the successful defense of William K. Smith against rape charges.         She was also an adviser in trials that won $20 million in judgments against the Ku Klux Klan, the White Aryan Resistance Group and skinheads.         Her work started with the case of the Oglala Sioux Indians prosecuted for a shootout with Federal agents at Wounded Knee, S.D., in 1973, and developed into a full-time career. Among her other cases were the dispute over Howard Hughes's will and the 1984 trial in which John Z. DeLorean was acquitted of cocaine charges.         She recommended that lawyers ask prospective jurors not if they were for or against an issue but open-ended questions to elicit their own thoughts, which she found to be more revealing.         Ms. Bennett was born in Tampa, Fla. After graduating from the University of Florida, she earned a master's degree in psychology at West Georgia College in Carrolton, Ga. and taught psychology at Santa Fe Community College in Gainesville, Fla.         Surviving are her husband, Robert B. Hirschhorn; her parents, Glenn and Jimmie Ellis of Hot Springs, Ark.; a brother, William Glenn Ellis of Houston, a sister, Rebecca Ellis Christy of Dallas; and a stepson, Matthew Hirschhorn of Arvada, Colo.

         Mollie Parnis, the fashion designer, whose Park Avenue living room was as well known to actors, journalists and Democrats as her Seventh Avenue showroom was to the women who bought her dresses, died yesterday at New York University Hospital. She was in her early 90's but had long refused to disclose her exact age.         She died of congestive heart failure, said a close friend, the writer Richard Clurman.         Born to a poor immigrant family in New York City before the turn of the century, she started working at odd jobs when she was 8 years old, and eventually built a multimillion-dollar dress business. But her interests ranged well beyond her Garment District cutting rooms. She became a skilled collector of art and of people and contributed some of her fortune to the beautification of New York and Jerusalem.         Dresses she designed were worn by First Ladies from Mamie Eisenhower to Betty Ford. Lady Bird Johnson became a a close friend and one year, one of Miss Parnis's designs was bought by four Kennedys in four separate cities.         In her office, Miss Parnis kept photographs of First Ladies wearing her designs posed with their husbands, as well as a signed photograph of Lyndon B. Johnson in a shirt she had made for him. To four Presidents, she was Mollie, but as often as she was invited to the White House, she said she could never get over the thrill of being in what she called "the President's house."  Simple Beginnings         With nothing more than a high school education and an upbringing that taught her that she would have to work for everything she would ever get, Miss Parnis started her career in New York in a blouse showroom. In no time, she had her name on the door, and then, in partnership with a man she met in school and later married, built a dress business that in its best years grossed $10 million.         But Seventh Avenue held no interest for her after working hours. "The last thing I want to talk about is what people are wearing," she once told an interviewer. She began to gather the most interesting people she knew at the Park Avenue duplex she moved into with her husband, Leon J. Livingston, in 1941. First she took up with movie stars, who were as eager to have her come to Hollywood as they were to visit her in New York.         Kirk Douglas and his wife, Anne, remained lifelong friends, but when the Hollywood crowd started to lose interest for her, she began a more lasting relationship with writers around the city. With the journalists came the politicians, and Mollie Parnis's salon was born.         Partly because of the company she kept, Miss Parnis keenly felt the absence of a college education. "My greatest regret is my lack of a formal education," she once told Life magazine. "I admire people who are able to express themselves well and who grasp facts fast. I read very slowly and have no background in literature or history or anything. When I'm reading, I often stop to look up a word that should be part of my vocabulary."         Even when she was in her 80's, she would sometimes wake at 7 A.M. to read books and newspapers so she could comment on the columns with the best of them. "What did you think of Scotty Reston's piece about Nixon and Kissinger?" she asked one day, and then began a crisp summary of her own very strong opinion. Although she tended to socialize mainly with Democrats, she made an exception for Henry Kissinger and his wife Nancy, Republicans who were among the New York social lions who liked to go to "Mollie's."         A sharp judge of character, she had a rapier tongue and a distinctive, commanding voice that she used to prick pretension. For her, impatience became a virtue as she cut off the longwinded and went on to someone or something she found more interesting. Sowing Urban Green         Through the Mollie Parnis Livingston Foundation of New York, Miss Parnis gave away at least a million and a half dollars. An early project was giving "Dress Up Your Neighborhood" prizes that helped create vest-pocket parks and green areas in decaying New York neighborhoods. It was patterned on a similar prize she had contributed to the city of Jerusalem.         After the death in 1979 of her only son, Robert Livingston, who for a time had been the publisher of More magazine, she established the Livingston Awards for newspaper, magazine and television journalists under 35 years old. Each year, $5,000 prizes are given to three journalists. Charles Eisendrath, a professor at the University of Michigan, who oversaw the journalism prize, said the award grew out of her admiration for members of the press.         "She collected journalists all her life," he said. "She collected them in the best sense: She loved them, she mothered them, she hectored them and she fed them. And they genuinely loved her."         Mollie Parnis was born on the Lower East Side in New York City on March 18. The year was noted in her official biography as 1905, but even Miss Parnis admitted that the date was "close" but certainly not precise. Throughout her life she was militantly unspecific about her age. Some of her friends believed she turned 90 in 1987. She liked to say she was of a certain age, with "a life expectancy of five minutes."         She was the eldest of five children of Abraham and Sara Parnis, who she said had emigrated from Austria before the turn of the century. Miss Parnis grew up on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She said she attended Wadleigh High School and later, Julia Richmond. She remembered that when she was 8, she tutored foreigners in English for 25 cents an hour.  A Desperate First Design         She said she got some notion that she might want to go into fashion in high school. A beau had invited her to a football game, and she badgered her mother to buy her a new outfit. "She took me down to Division Street and got me a navy dress," she said some seven decades later. "I still remember it. Blue serge." After the football game, she said, her date offered to take her dancing and suggested she go home and change. But she was wearing the only dress she had, so she took a scissors, cut the neckline, took a lace collar from a blouse of her mother's and added an artificial flower. It was her first design.         In 1923, she became an assistant saleswoman in the showroom of a blouse manufacturer. Occasionally, she made suggestions to the designers -- a change of neckline, a jabot, a frill, a different sleeve. One summer, when she made a $20,000 sale to one customer, she asked for a raise. Her boss made a counterproposal -- her name in the lobby directory.         "Well," Miss Parnis said, "you don't know what that did for me. I got so excited over it I had all my friends come over to Seventh Avenue to look at 'Mollie Parnis, fourth floor.' It was like an actress having her name up in lights the first time."         Meanwhile, the fellow who took her to the football game was in the silk business and she figured that if she worked in a dress house where they used silk she might see him more often. It worked out just as she had hoped. She and Leon Livingston were married in 1930 and in 1933, in the midst of the Great Depression, they went into business together. Miss Parnis, who could neither sketch nor cut nor drape, became the designer. Mr. Livingston handled the business aspects. They were successful from the start.         As their business prospered, Miss Parnis hired other designers, but she remained the fashion editor. "Over the years," she once said, "as many designers as we've had, the clothes always looked like Mollie Parnis." That meant versatile, comfortable dresses in good fabrics. They were fashionable but not trendy. She counseled women to avoid fads. "I've always had a theory," she told an interviewer, "that good designing doesn't mean dresses you have to throw away every year. Things shouldn't go out of date overnight." A Brief Closing         When Miss Parnis's husband died in 1962, she went out of business. But only for three months. "Then," she said, "I went out to dinner one night with a gentleman who asked when I was going to open my showroom again. I said, 'Maybe never.' And he said, 'Oh, my God! The only thing that made you a little different was that you worked. Don't you know that widows in this town with a little money are a dime a dozen?' Well, I got back into business so fast, I can't tell you."         Miss Parnis said when she was growing up she had no notion of the world "out there" -- the world of wealth and society. But as her business prospered, she quickly learned how to design her life as well as she designed dresses. In time, Mollie Parnis became her own best creation. There was the apartment on Park Avenue ("When we first walked in there to look I could hardly believe I was there -- 'Park Avenue' I kept marveling to myself").         Then there was the country house in Katonah, in Westchester County. ("We had a tennis court and one of the first swimming pools in the East. Swimming pools in those days were for Hollywood.") There was the collection of fine china, the decorator (Billy Baldwin) and finally, the Impressionist paintings -- by Picasso, Vuillard, Roualt, Utrillo, Cezanne, Soutine, and her most prized possession, a Matisse.         When Miss Parnis heard that a friend was selling the Matisse she had admired she immediately agreed to buy it. She remembered that she went into her husband's office and said she had just bought a Matisse. "Well, unbuy it," she said he told her. Moments later a friend came by and saw her crying. "Why don't you go down to the bank and borrow the money," he suggested.         She said that it had never occurred to her that she could go to the bank herself, without her husband, and get a loan. She borrowed $25,000 and got her Matisse. Its estimated worth is tens of millions of dollars today.         It was the same Matisse she pledged to the Israel Museum in honor of Jerusalem's mayor, Teddy Kollek, on his 70th birthday. Years later, she had misgivings and decided it should go into her estate.         In 1984, when her dresses were selling for $350 to $1,500, she closed her Seventh Avenue showroom. Within weeks, she went back to work once again, designing Mollie Parnis At-Home fashions in a company that had been started by her sister Peggy and was then owned by her nephew, Neal Hochman.         Mr. Hochman, her closest relative, survives her. In accordance with her wishes, a private cremation will take place. A memorial service will be held in September.       
         Olga Loeb, a trustee of Bronx-Lebanon Hospital Center who did volunteer work for more than five decades, died on Sunday in Rhinebeck, N.Y. She was 97 years old and lived in the Bronx.         Mrs. Loeb managed her gift shop at the hospital on Friday as usual and died at Northern Dutchess Hospital of complications after an asthma attack, said a hospital spokesman. She was on a family visit when she became ill.         She was a native of Vienna who moved to the Bronx in 1911.         As a girl, she collected pennies for a new dispensary that became a forerunner of the hospital that her future husband helped to found in 1927 -- Bronx-Lebanon on the Grand Concourse in the Tremont section. A Buyer for Store Chains         She studied at Syracuse University and then built a successful career buying merchandise for department-store chains. She returned to the Bronx at the age of 40 and married Dr. Martin J. Loeb, a surgeon and philanthropist.         Mrs. Loeb became active in the hospital's Ladies' Auxiliary in 1942 and had been its president since 1953. She also served as an officer or head of various hospital committees as well as the Comprehensive Planning Board for her local health district.         After her husband's death in 1961, Mrs. Loeb persuaded the hospital board to convert part of a waiting room into a gift shop that she would run with a few volunteers. It sells flowers and teddy bears among other things and has raised more than $1 million for the hospital. Mrs. Loeb herself opened the shop every weekday at 7:30 A.M. and closed it at 5 P.M.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Linda J. Laubenstein, a Manhattan physician who in 1981 discovered some of the first mysterious cases of what became the worldwide AIDS epidemic, died on Saturday at her summer home in Chatham, Mass., on Cape Cod. She was 45 years old.         Her family said an autopsy was pending. She suffered from severe asthma and weakness from childhood polio, an illness that required three major operations and left her a paraplegic at the age of 5.         "She is incredibly important in the history of AIDS, a genuine pioneer and a real fighter for what she believed," said Larry Kramer, an author and a leader in AIDS causes.         Dr. Laubenstein inspired the character of Dr. Emma Brookner, a principal role in Mr. Kramer's play on acquired immune deficiency syndrome, "The Normal Heart." He said an agreement was near on the production of a movie version by Barbra Streisand, with Ms. Streisand playing the Laubenstein-Brookner part.         Dr. Jeffrey B. Greene, a colleague, called Dr. Laubenstein "the ultimate AIDS physician." Despite her handicap, she met patients in the emergency room in the middle of the night and even made house calls, using her motorized wheelchair and public buses. "She was sicker than most of her patients but didn't let it stop her," Dr. Greene said. First Paper on Subject         Dr. Laubenstein and Dr. Alvin Friedman-Kien wrote the first paper to be published in a medical journal on the alarming appearance of Kaposi's sarcoma, a previously rare disease of lesions of the skin and other tissues. Most of the cases were in young gay men suffering a puzzling collapse of the immune system.         Recalling one of the first cases, she described a 33-year-old man with two purple spots behind his ears. Initially he responded to the cancer drugs she prescribed. But 18 months later he was dead, his body covered with 75 lesions.         Many more cases followed. By May 1982, she had seen 62 patients with AIDS -- a fourth of the national total recorded at the time. She said then that "this problem certainly is not going away."         Her father, George Laubenstein, said yesterday, "She told us from the very beginning that this is going to be a terrible epidemic."         Dr. Laubenstein's private practice grew to be predominantly AIDS cases. She and Dr. Freidman-Kien arranged the first full-scale medical conference on AIDS, at New York University in 1983. She also help to found the Kaposi's Sarcoma Research Fund in 1983. Jobs in Office Services         In 1989, she and Dr. Greene founded Multitasking, a nonprofit organization selling office services to other businesses and employing people with AIDS as the workers. Her concern was that AIDS patients often lost their jobs and that work was vital to emotional and physical health as well as for financial support.         Dr. Laubenstein was outspoken about what she said was the neglect by government and society in fighting AIDS. Some of her views were controversial among gay groups, particularly her belief that bathhouses should be shut down to discourage unsafe sex.         Born in Boston, she grew up in Barrington, R.I. She graduated from Barnard College and New York University Medical School. Her specialties were hematology and oncology, and she was a clinical professor at the New York University Medical Center.         Surviving are her parents, George and Priscilla of Harwich Port, Mass., and a brother, Peter of Melvin Village, N.H.       
         Dr. LaDonne H. Schulman, a prominent researcher in advanced genetics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 56 years old.         The college said the cause of death was cancer.         Dr. Schulman, a professor of developmental biology and cancer, was known for her work with transfer RNA, or tRNA -- molecules that complete the process of synthesizing proteins according to the DNA code. Before their discovery, Francis Crick, the Nobelist and a discoverer of DNA, had foreseen their existence as the "bilingual molecules" that understand the chemical languages of DNA and protein.         As it turned out, each tRNA molecule bears one amino acid that it ultimately inserts into the growing protein at the proper location, as prescribed by the DNA sequence. Dr. Schulman's particular interest lay in the process of recognition by which tRNAs came to carry the correct amino acids.         The hospital said she helped to demonstrate that enzymes rely on a particular section of the tRNA molecule -- the anticodon -- to match the right amino acids with their tRNA carriers. In the process, she found ways to test tRNA activity and showed why all proteins start with the same amino acid, methionine.         LaDonne Heaton Schulman was born in Jacksonville, Fla., and graduated summa cum laude from Wheaton College before spending a year as a Fulbright scholar at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz, Germany. She received M.A. and Ph.D. degrees in chemistry at Columbia University and did postdoctoral studies at New York University Medical Center in 1966.         She joined Albert Einstein as an assistant professor in the Department of Developmental Biology and Cancer in 1968 and became a full professor 10 years later.         Dr. Schulman is survived by her brother, Cherrill Paul Heaton of Gainesville, Fla.       
         Dr. Evelyn B. Man, a biochemist who helped develop the first widely used test to detect low hormone levels in the thyroid gland, which enabled treatment to prevent mental retardation, died on Sept. 3 at her home in West Hartford, Conn. She was 87 years old.         She died of cancer, a funeral home spokesman said.         "She was one of the top authorities in the world on thyroid," said Dr. Philip K. Bondy, the retired chairman of the department of medicine at Yale, where she did most of her work.         Her efforts won the American Thyroid Association's Distinguished Service Award and the United Cerebral Palsy Award for Research.         Dr. Man was a full-time researcher and educator in biochemistry for more than 40 years. In the 1930's she worked with John P. Peters and Herman Yannet to develop the first practical test for thyroid levels.         The procedure, the protein bound iodine test, and a later version called the butanol extractable iodine test, enabled the identification of people with abnormal thyroid functions. High thyroid levels, if untreated, can be fatal. Low thyroid levels cause cretinism, but that is reversible with thyroid supplements.         Early surveys using the test showed that low hormone levels in the thyroid gland were the leading cause of preventable retardation. Many institutionalized patients were found to have been misdiagnosed as demented and were restored to normal functioning with thyroid medication.         Later thyroid tests, developed by other scientists, are now used to screen all newborns in developed countries.         Dr. Man also studied the effect of nuclear radiation on thyroid functioning in survivors of the atomic bombings of Japan in World War II.         Dr. Man was born in Lawrence, L.I. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1925 and earned a doctorate in physiological chemistry at Yale in 1932.         She worked variously as a technician, researcher and professor at Yale from 1928 to 1961, then worked nine years at Brown University.         Although she retired from full-time work in 1970, she continued her studies. She published 156 scientific papers over a period of about 60 years, the last in 1991.         For much of her life Dr. Man lived in North Stonington, Conn., where she was an officer in the North Stonington Historical Society. She was also active in the local hospital and library in Westerly, R.I.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Pamela Hollingworth, who drew national attention at the age of 5 when she was lost for eight days in a New Hampshire forest, died on Sept. 11 at her home in Orleans, Mass., on Cape Cod. She was 56 years old and also had a home in Sarasota, Fla, where she retired recently.         She died of a heart ailment, her family said.         Miss Hollingworth was a former vice president of the American Cancer Society.         In October 1941, she was lost for eight days on Mount Chocorua, a 3,475-foot peak in the White Mountains National Forest, after wandering away from a picnic wearing only overalls and sneakers.         Her disappearance touched off a search by more than 400 rescue workers. She had nothing to eat but drank often from mountain brooks. Despite freezing nighttime temperatures, she was found unharmed two miles from the picnic site.         When the little girl was reunited with her father, her first words were, "Daddy, I've been waiting for you."         Miss Hollingworth was born in Lowell, Mass., and grew up there and in Chelmsford nearby. She graduated from Smith College in 1958 and started a public relations career in New York.         She became the editorial director of the Arthritis Foundation, corporate communications director for Lane Bryant, vice president for creative services at the Cancer Society and communications director of the United States Committee for the United Nations Children's Fund.         Survivors include her mother, Blanche, of North Conway, N.H., and a brother, Joseph E. Hollingworth Jr., of Carlisle, Mass.       
         Dr. Barbara McClintock, one of the most influential geneticists of the century, died on Wednesday night at Huntington Hospital on Long Island. She was 90 years old and lived nearby at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, where she had conducted research for more than 50 years.         She died of natural causes, said Lisa Gentry, a spokeswoman for the lab.         Dr. McClintock had an uncanny ability to understand the nature of genes and how they interact decades before biologists discovered the molecular tools to dissect genetic material. Working with corn all her life, she is best known for her discovery that fragments of genetic material move among chromosomes, regulating the way genes control cells' growth and development.         Modern genetics has known no figure quite like Dr. McClintock, who worked alone and chose not to publish some of her revolutionary observations for years, explaining later that she thought no one would accept the findings. She never gave lectures, as most scientists do to build their careers. Instead, until her last days, she worked in her laboratory at Cold Spring Harbor 12 hours a day, six days a week. Until 1986, she did not have a telephone, requesting that anyone who wanted to talk to her write a letter instead.         Dr. McClintock's findings were so profound that she garnered honors and prizes throughout her long career, including membership in the National Academy of Sciences in 1944, president of the Genetics Society in 1945, the National Medal of Science in 1970, the first MacArthur Laureate Award, for $60,000 a year for life, in 1981, and a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1983.         She was the first woman to win an unshared Nobel Prize in that category and the third woman to win an unshared Nobel science prize. The first was Marie Curie in 1911 and the second was Dorothy C. Hodgkin in 1964, both for chemistry.         "She was a giant figure in the history of genetics," said Dr. James Shapiro of the University of Chicago. "I think she is the most important figure there is in biology in general."         Dr. James Watson, director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and co-discoverer of the structure of DNA, the chemical that makes up genes, said Dr. McClintock was one of the three most important figures in the history of genetics, one of "the three M's," he said. The other two, Gregor Mendel and Thomas Hunt Morgan, lived in the 19th and early 20th centuries and laid the groundwork for notions of inheritance.         In the 1930's, she was a discoverer of the fact that chromosomes break and recombine to create genetic changes in a process known as crossing over, a discovery that explained puzzling patterns of inheritance. She also discovered a structure called the nucleolar organizer of the chromosome, which seemed to order the genetic material during cell division, a finding that was not explained by molecular biologists for three more decades.         J. R. S. Fincham of Edinburgh, Scotland, writing in the Aug. 20 issue of Nature, a British science journal, said that Dr. McClintock's "solitary style of work, total independence of thought and extraordinary record of getting things right have elevated her to the status of a prophet in the eyes of some."         Dr. McClintock spent her professional life working on corn, using the telltale patterns of colored kernels to disclose the breaking, joining and rearranging of genes and chromosomes inside the cells. Because the pigments of the kernels are inherited, Dr. McClintock could trace genes through the changes in the kernels.  Astonishing Earlier Discoveries         To the astonishment of molecular geneticists, whose precise tools now allow them to cut and snip submicroscopic genes, Dr. McClintock's discoveries about the nature of genes and inheritance were made at a time when no one even knew what DNA was.         In the 1930's, Dr. McClintock established her reputation by becoming one of the scientists to develop an understanding of chromosomes as the basis of heredity, work that was honored by her National Medal of Science.         Dr. McClintock's Nobel Prize was for her discovery that the genetic material is not fixed, but instead is fluid. Small fragments of DNA, called transposable elements, actually move from place to place and, in doing so, they control the expression of genes.         Dr. McClintock made this discovery nearly 40 years before she won the Nobel Prize, at a time when genetics was still so rudimentary that her ideas baffled other scientists and were often dismissed outright or ignored.         In an introduction to a volume of papers about Dr. McClintock, produced in celebration of her 90th birthday, Dr. Nina Fedoroff of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and Dr. David Botstein of Stanford University described Dr. McClintock's plight.         Her ideas about transposable elements, they wrote, were "ahead of her time and Barbara found herself in an anomalous and unique position," adding, "She was universally respected and admired as one of the leading geneticists of her era, yet the reaction to her latest and perhaps most profound discoveries and insights was often uncomprehending or indifferent and not infrequently dismissive or even hostile." Filed Her Early Data         Concluding that she could never convince the scientific community, Dr. McClintock doggedly carried on with her work, carefully filing her data away and writing them up only in her annual reports to the Carnegie Institution of Washington, which supported her work.         In her biography of Dr. McClintock, "A Feeling for the Organism," Dr.  Evelyn Fox Keller of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology wrote that geneticists were baffled by Dr. McClintock's ideas because they seemed too much at odds with the very nature of Darwinian evolution. The theory of evolution holds that changes occur randomly in genes, giving rise to variations that may or may not prove beneficial.         Dr. McClintock, however, was saying that purposeful changes occur in genes, that transposable elements jump to specific places to insert themselves into genetic material and alter it.         Another stumbling block, Dr. Keller said, was that Dr. McClintock was working with corn, a species whose complex patterns of development were clear to her but not to many others. And she had done her work alone without the benefit of long discussions trying to explain her ideas to colleagues.         Finally, in the late 1970's, when molecular biologists isolated transposable elements in bacteria and then discovered that they were universally used by cells to control genes, Dr. McClintock's work was rediscovered and widely celebrated as prescient.         Dr. Shapiro said: "I think the implications of this work are just being realized. The idea that the genome is capable of repairing itself, and that it is capable of reconstructing itself, that there are systems in the cell that can detect damage and do appropriate things to repair it, has tremendous implications for evolution as well as for genetics." Knew Where 'Mysteries Lie'         Because Dr. McClintock worked alone, emphatically rejecting reductionism, because she was so often right and saw so clearly when others were muddled, she has gained a reputation as almost a mystic. But Dr. Shapiro said she was more "someone who understands where the mysteries lie than someone who mystifies."         Dr. McClintock "understands the complexity of the genome and the limits to our understanding of it," he said, adding, "She appreciated that the problems we are addressing are enormously deep and complex."         Dr. Keller described Dr. McClintock as a person who from infancy valued her solitude and independence.         Barbara McClintock was born on June 16, 1902, in Hartford. The daughter of a doctor, she grew up in Brooklyn and learned to love science while attending Erasmus Hall High School there. When she was 17, she enrolled at Cornell University's College of Agriculture, a university that had been extremely hospitable to women.         When she was a junior she was invited to take the university's graduate course in genetics and became, unofficially, a graduate student. From the time she received her Ph.D. in 1927 until 1941, she worked at Cornell University and at the University of Missouri, collaborating with some of the country's most eminent geneticists. From 1941 until her death, Dr. McClintock worked at Cold Spring Harbor, following her own course.         Dr. McClintock is survived by a sister, Mignon Crowell, who lives in Florida, and a brother, Thomas N. McClintock of Newtown, Conn.       
         Joan Mitchell, an American painter who was an important figure in the second generation of American Abstract Expressionists, died yesterday in a hospital in Paris. She was 66 years old.         She died of lung cancer, said Robert Miller, her dealer.         An ecstatic and inventive colorist with a way of putting on the paint that was unmistakably her own, Miss Mitchell worked as much with memories of her childhood in Saugatuck, Mich., and of her youth on the East River in Brooklyn, as with the treasured landscape on which she looked out every day from her house above the town of Vetheuil, near Paris.         Throughout her life, she insisted that the tumultuous and airborne expression of feeling in her paintings was not a matter of instinct left free to run wild. As she said to the historian Irving Sandler: "The freedom in my work is quite controlled. I don't close my eyes and hope for the best." The historian Leo Steinberg once wrote of her ability "to score triumphantly for the willed act as against chance effect." Appreciation Grew         Like many another American expatriate, she sometimes felt herself underrated by New York opinion. But in recent years, working on a scale even larger than that favored by the first generation of Abstract Expressionists, she found both a glorious fulfillment in her work and an eager response from collectors and critics.         Her recent shows at the Robert Miller Gallery in New York City won wide praise, and the Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum and the National Gallery were among the museums that had recently bought major works of hers.         Joan Mitchell was born in Chicago on Feb. 21, 1926. She was the daughter of James Herbert Mitchell and Marion Strobel, co-editor with Harriet Monroe of Poetry magazine. As a child, she came to know T. S. Eliot, Ezra Pound, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Thornton Wilder, Dylan Thomas and others as visitors to the family home.         As a young woman in Chicago, Miss Mitchell became acquainted with the great paintings by Cezanne, Matisse and others. She was a graduate of Smith College and later attended the art school of the Art Institute of Chicago, after which she came to New York. Won a Traveling Fellowship         Thanks to the $2,000 that came with an Edward L. Ryerson traveling fellowship from the institute, she spent a year in France in 1948-49, working first in Paris and later in Le Lavandou in Provence. While in France, she married Barney Rosset, the founder of the Grove Press publishing house.         Back in New York in 1950, she soon became accepted as a promising member of the downtown art scene. One of the few women to be admitted to membership in the influential Artists' Club, she participated in 1951 in the "Ninth Street Show" organized by the Club and supervised by Leo Castelli.         By the mid-1950's her work was admired by some of the best judges of the day. In 1957 she took part in "Artists of the New York School: Second Generation," organized at the Jewish Museum by Meyer Schapiro and introduced by Leo Steinberg.         A return to Paris in 1955, three years after her divorce from Mr. Rosset, led to a gradual withdrawal from New York and an ever-increasing identification with life in France. This was reinforced by her meeting with the painter Jean-Paul Riopelle, who was to be her companion from 1955 until 1979. Denied Monet Influenced Her         After the death of her mother in 1967, Miss Mitchell inherited enough money to buy a two-acre estate above Vetheuil, a little town on the Seine that is best known for the residence there of Claude Monet. She lived there permanently from 1968 until her death.         Her house looked out over a panoramic view of the river that inevitably put every visitor in mind of Monet. But Miss Mitchell was characteristically emphatic in her denials that Monet had had any influence upon her.         In recent years, a hip operation hindered her movements, though it did not prevent her from maneuvering the path from her house to her favorite restaurant far below.         Among her major retrospective exhibitions were those at the Whitney Museum of American Art (1974), the Musee d'Art Moderne de la Ville de Paris (1982), and in 1988 a touring exhibition that went to the Corcoran Gallery in Washington, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and elsewhere. Earlier this year, "Joan Mitchell Pastels" was seen at the Whitney Museum. In 1991 she received the Grand Prix des Arts from the City of Paris.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Janice Gilbert Fulton, a bridge expert and game-show personality in the early days of television, was presumed dead after a boating accident last week near her home about 150 miles north of Haiti, her lawyer said yesterday.         The lawyer, Ian Miller, said that Mrs. Fulton's husband, David Fulton, 70 years old, a mining engineer, was also presumed dead, as was Dan Cooper, 45, a Canadian real estate developer who was a passenger when the Fultons' 22-foot fishing boat capsized in choppy waters on Thursday morning.         Mr. Miller said he notified the authorities when the Fultons failed to return to their home, on Providenciales in the Turks and Caicos Islands.         He said rescuers found two survivors, Douglas Colledi of London, Ontario, and Lucien Vixama of Providenciales, in the Fultons' righted boat on Friday. A search of the Caribbean by private planes and the Coast Guard was called off on Sunday.         Family members said Mrs. Fulton was born in New York City about 1920. She played Little Orphan Annie on radio soap operas. Later she played the Paying Teller on the television give-away show "Break the Bank" in the 1950's.         In 1955 she married Tobias Stone of Las Vegas, Nev., a champion bridge player who taught her to play the game. They won the Goldman Pairs in 1957, making them the only married couple to win in the 64-year history of the event; they also won the Master Mixed Team Championship in 1965. She won three other national titles: the Women's Teams in 1956 and 1969 and the Life Master Women's Pairs in 1965.         Mr. Stone and Mrs. Fulton divorced in 1975, and in 1980 she married Mr. Fulton, who had been the chief mining engineer in the Stone family gold and silver mining business, where she worked from 1974 to 1978.         Mrs. Fulton's first husband, William Miles, lives in Los Angeles. Her second husband, William Dunlop, is deceased. She is survived by a son, Jeffrey Miles of Los Angeles, and by a daughter, Leslie Coren of Hallandale, Fla.       
         Jacqueline K. Eubanks, a college librarian, an editor and a proponent of multicultural education, died on Thursday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 54 years old and lived in Brooklyn.         She died of complications from AIDS, said friends and colleagues at the library at Brooklyn College, where she was on the faculty since 1966.         Ms. Eubanks significantly expanded the college library's African and Caribbean collection and was a founding member of the Social Responsibilities Roundtable of the American Library Association.         She was the originator and senior editor of "Alternatives in Print," an international catalog of books, pamphlets, periodicals and audio-visual material not easily found in mainstream references works. She also helped organize book fairs in the city.         Ms. Eubanks grew up in Chicago. She earned her bachelor's degree and master's degree in library science at the University of Chicago and a master's degree at Columbia University Teachers College.         Before joining Brooklyn College, she worked as a librarian for the United States Army Special Services in Germany and for the American Association of Advertising Agencies in Manhattan.         Her marriage to Lloyd W. Eubanks ended in divorce.         She is survived by a brother, Alan Peldzus of Chicago.

         Ellen Furman, a founding member and a past president of the New York City chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62 years old.         Mrs. Furman died of complications of diabetes, said her family, which reported her death yesterday.         Mrs. Furman, who was a graduate of Finch College, had suffered from diabetes since infancy. She devoted her life to urging the public in general and those suffering from diabetes in particular to press for more research that might lead to a cure.         The foundation is the chief private financial supporter of scientific research on diabetes.         The New York Juvenile Diabetes Foundation chapter is the largest of the organization's 126 chapters in the United States and abroad. Mrs. Furman helped found the volunteer organization in the early 1970's, and served a year's term as president from 1974 to 1975. She also held several other positions with the foundation.         In 1992, Mrs. Furman received the Shining Star Award from the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation for her "longstanding commitment to find the cure for diabetes."         Mrs. Furman is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Julie Rosenthal, and two sons, Matthew and Ted, all of New York City.         Correction:  November 27, 1992, Friday         An obituary yesterday about Ellen Furman, a founding member and a past president of the New York City chapter of the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, misstated her age. She was 52 years old.       
         Hanya Holm, a major choreographer of modern dance and Broadway musicals, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 99 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pneumonia, said Heidi Holm, her daughter-in-law.         To theatergoers, Miss Holm was known as the choreographer of musicals including Cole Porter's "Kiss Me, Kate" and "Out of This World" and Alan Jay Lerner and Frederick Loewe's "My Fair Lady" and "Camelot." To modern-dance aficionados, Miss Holm was the most significant choreographer and dancer to have come out of the Central European Expressionist dance tradition in Germany. Its most noted figure was Mary Wigman, and Miss Holm was her student. Her 1937 "Trend," a dance of social protest, is considered a masterwork of American modern dance. Miss Holm has been considered a member of a pantheon of American modern-dance choreographers that included Martha Graham, Doris Humphrey and Charles Weidman.         A funny, humane and uncompromising woman, Miss Holm encouraged her pupils to find their own individual ways of artistic expression. Her students included leading choreographers as diverse as Alwin Nikolais, Murray Louis, Glen Tetley, Don Redlich and Lucinda Childs. Sound and Movement         Born in Worms, Germany, Miss Holm, whowas originally named Johanna Eckert, pursued a career in dance against her family's wishes. She had been exposed to dance at the Dalcroze Institute of Applied Rhythm in Frankfurt in 1915. The theories of Emile Jaques-Dalcroze, a Swiss composer and teacher who helped his music and dance students develop a sense of rhythm by translating sounds into movement, had at that point influenced a generation of German modern dancers, of whom the best known was Wigman. Miss Holm was dancing with Wigman's troupe by 1921 and taught in her school in Dresden. She remained a leading Wigman teacher and dancer for 10 years, creating roles in "Feier" and "Totenmal," which she helped Wigman choreograph. It was during this time that she changed her name.         In 1930-31, Sol Hurok brought the Wigman company to the United States for a transcontinental tour. Hurok had urged Wigman to found an American school, and she agreed, sending Miss Holm to America to direct it. Miss Holm arrived in New York City in September 1931, and for the next five years she devoted herself to teaching. She bought the school when its popularity began to decline after the first year, and in 1936 the school was renamed the Hanya Holm School of Dance. The new style she was developing, she told her pupils, was based on the proposition that "emotionally the German dance is basically subjective and the American dance is objective." The distinction, she added, was "one of 'being' as contrasted with 'doing.' "         Miss Holm took on other teaching positions in important dance institutions, among them, in 1934, the Bennington College Summer School of Dance, the forerunner of the American Dance Festival, where the "Trend" was first performed. In 1941, she developed the influential summer dance program at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, where she continued to teach until 1983. Part of the success of her teaching lay in her pithy instructions to students. "Keep the beat," she told them, "but undermine it." Another instruction was to "use the feet as if you would pick up a flower with your toes." Her students were familiar with the command to "feel it, children, don't schlep it." 'Living Essence'         She often expressed her disagreement with what she saw as an emphasis on chill technical expertise in American dance teaching. "If I see one more leg extension, I've had it," Miss Holm said in 1984. "There is security in a major leg extension. But it means nothing. The simplest thing is to shun the emotions and emphasize technique. But you become like a nice stove that doesn't give any heat." One had to be careful, she noted, of trying to instill that "little bit of living essence." "You can't take something away without         giving         something," she said.         She had begun choreographing in 1928, but her American concert career began in 1937 with a tour of Midwestern colleges. She made her New York debut that year in a program that included "Trend," her first major work in America, which had a cast of 33 dancers, some of them from her own company and the rest students at Bennington. A depiction of society's being destroyed by its false values, then saved by a cataclysm, "Trend" was an ambitious, architectonic dance that unfolded in eight sections on a massive set designed by Arch Lauterer that consisted of free-standing columns, an elevated platform and a ramp. Many years later, Miss Holm said the difficulties and expense of reconstructing the set prevented her from reviving the dance.         John Martin, writing in The New York Times, called "Trend" a "substantial piece of artistry" that "undertakes to deal with a colossal subject" in dance whose "designs appear in great sweeping dimensions, developing out of their own content, unhurried and unfaltering." He added that "Trend" was "not only the season's most important work but might be considered also as one of the most important works of the period, for it advances the dance signally along the road it has so rightly chosen."         One of the best descriptions of Miss Holm's dances and of "Trend" came, however, in an observation made by the choreographer about Wigman's work. "In her dances she alternately grapples with space as an opponent and caresses it as though it were a living, sentient thing," Miss Holm said. "In her gestures and movement she carves boldly and delicately visible and fluid forms, shaping, surrounding and sinking in the space which presses close about her." Early TV, Then Broadway         Miss Holm became a United States citizen in 1939, the same year she received the Dance Magazine Award for "Tragic Exodus," a powerful dance of social commentary. In 1939, she also became the first concert dancer to present her work on television in the United States, showing a shortened version of "Metropolitan Daily," a humorous depiction of a daily newspaper.         Miss Holm had abandoned modern dance for the Broadway stage by 1947, although she continued to create dances for her summer students and choreographed four well-received dances for the Don Redlich Dance Company in the mid-1970's and mid-1980's. Her first success was with the 1948 "Ballet Ballads," a suite of dances she created with Katherine Litz and Paul Godkin to music composed by Jerome Moross, with lyrics by John Latouche.         As a result of the success of her dance, "The Eccentricities of Davy Crockett," Miss Holm was invited to choreograph "Kiss Me, Kate" in 1948 and won a New York Drama Critics Award. Over the next 18 years, she created dances for 13 musicals becoming known for her ability to meet the stylistic needs of each show. In 1952, she became the first choreographer to copyright a dance: her choreography for "Kiss Me, Kate," submitted as a written Labanotation score on microfilm.         Among Miss Holm's other Broadway musicals were "Out of This World," "My Darlin' Aida" and "The Golden Apple." She also created the dances for the London and Tel Aviv productions of "My Fair Lady." She choreographed and directed the opera "The Ballad of Baby Doe" in 1956 in Central City, Colo., and Gluck's "Orfeo ed Euridice" for the second annual Vancouver International Festival in 1959. Among her film and television assignments were the dances for the 1955 film version of "The Vagabond King." Miss Holm was also known for her essays, published in periodicals and books, on dance teaching and technique.         Her honors included an award from the Federation of Jewish Philanthropies for her contributions to modern dance in 1958, the Capezio Award, the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award in 1984 and the Astaire Award in 1987. "It just happened," Miss Holm said of her career in accepting the Scripps Award, "and whatever has happened was with love, dedication, good will, gladly and well. I keep on doing it as good as I can and as long as I can."         Miss Holm's marriage to Reinhold Martin Kuntze, a painter and sculptor, ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, Klaus, of Wilkes-Barre, Pa., and three granddaughters, Karen Trautlein of Wilkes-Barre, Angela Holm of San Diego and Jessica Werbin of New Haven, Conn.       
         Louise L. Hoxie, an educator, died Monday at Huntington Hospital. She was 75 and lived in Oyster Bay, L.I.         She died of complications from diabetes, her family said.         With her husband, Dr. R. Gordon Hoxie, she contributed to the growth of C. W. Post College on Long Island and established the Center for the Study of the Presidency.         Mrs. Hoxie, a native of Cincinnati, graduated from the University of Cincinnati. She did graduate work in French at Penn State University, the Universite de Paris and Columbia University. She served as dean of women at the Cincinnati Conservatory of Music and taught French literature at Nebraska Wesleyan and Aix-en-Provence before her marriage in 1953 to Dr. Hoxie.         Dr. Hoxie became the first dean of the C. W. Post campus of Long Island University in 1955 and tended to its academic growth while his wife taught French and acted as the college's official hostess. Her husband became chancellor of Long Island University in 1964.         In 1968, Mrs. Hoxie and her husband started the Center for the Study of the Presidency, based in New York and Washington. Dr. Hoxie served as its president. Mrs. Hoxie helped to found the Presidential Studies Quarterly and served as its editor. The center reported that its more than 450 former fellows are establishing a memorial fellowship in her name.         Mrs. Hoxie was a consultant to the State Department and the United States Information Agency, serving on their selection and promotion boards. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the Public Members Association of the Foreign Service. A frequent visitor to South Korea, she was a member of the board of the American Friends of Chung-Ang University.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Hoxie is survived by a brother, Dr. Wallace C. Lobitz of Portland, Ore.       
         Stella Adler, an exponent of Method acting whom many considered the leading American teacher of her craft, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 91 years old.         She died of heart failure, said Irene Gilbert, the director of the Stella Adler Conservatory in Hollywood.         Miss Adler was born into a celebrated acting family rooted in the Yiddish theater. She made her stage debut at the age of 4, appeared in nearly 200 plays in the United States and abroad, and occasionally directed productions. She also shaped the careers of thousands of grateful performers, including Marlon Brando, Warren Beatty and Robert De Niro, at the Stella Adler Conservatory of Acting, which she founded in Manhattan in 1949 and where she taught for decades.         Mercurial, with honey-blond hair and expressive gray-green eyes, Miss Adler was aristocratic, physically and vocally, and her teaching was passionate, scholarly and volatile, delivered with evangelical showmanship, wicked wit and pungent phrases. She kept her students spellbound by raging, purring, cursing, cajoling and, from time to time, complimenting. 'She Dares Her Students'         Her classroom performances were among the most energetic in New York, Foster Hirsch wrote in his 1984 book "A Method to Their Madness." "Stella," he wrote, "is theatrical royalty who instills in her students a sense of the nobility of acting. She dares her students to         act         , to lift their bodies and their voices, to be larger than themselves, to love language and ideas."         Miss Adler counseled: "The teacher has to inspire, to agitate. You cannot teach acting. You can only stimulate what's already there." Often blunt, she told one actress: "You've got no talent! Nothing affects you!" As a young actor mumbled through a monologue, she shouted, "Everything is Hoboken to you!"         Miss Adler's most frenetic years were with the Group Theater, the experimental Depression-era company founded by Harold Clurman, Lee Strasberg and Cheryl Crawford. It was a pivotal movement in the growth of American performing arts, uniting writers, directors and actors in working to shape socially relevant theater. Members of the ensemble were leading interpreters of the Method, the technique based on the work and writings of Konstantin Stanislavsky, the legendary Moscow Art Theater actor and director, who died in 1938. The Two Methods         The Method revolutionized American theater. Classical acting instruction had focused on developing external talents, while Method acting was the first systematized training that also developed internal abilities, sensory, psychological, emotional.         Strasberg, who headed the Actors Studio until his death in 1982, rooted his view of the Method on what Stanislavsky had stressed in his early career, that the actor should perform extensive "affective memory" exercises, improvising and conjuring up "the conscious past" to convey emotion: for example, dwelling on a personal tragedy to show anguish.         Miss Adler, opposing this approach, went to Paris and studied intensively with Stanislavsky for five weeks in 1934. She found he had revised his theories to stress that the actor should create by imagination rather than by memory and that the key to success was "truth, truth in the circumstances of the play."         "Your talent is in your imagination," she taught. "The rest is lice." She discussed plays as scripts for actors, exploring the texts for performance clues. She also believed that the art, architecture and clothes of an era were important in shaping a role. The Limits of Reality         One student volunteered, "When you told me to imagine a lake in Switzerland, I couldn't help but remember a real lake I had seen in Switzerland."         "Then put your lake in Morocco," Miss Adler replied. "You must get away from the real thing because the real thing will limit your acting and cripple you. To think of your own mother's death each time you want to cry onstage is schizophrenic and sick."         "Don't use your conscious past," she advised. "Use your creative imagination to         create         a past that belongs to your character. I don't want you to be stuck with your own life. It's too little."         She encouraged students to read about Stanislavsky's exercises to ease muscular tension and aid concentration, but she did not teach them. Strasberg contended that she had abandoned the internal emphasis of the Method and that her classes were ineffectual. She argued that he so exceeded Stanislavsky's intent that his teaching was psychologically and emotionally intimidating and dangerous, producing neurotic, self-indulgent actors.         Their approaches were vastly different, but the results could be similar. Ellen Burstyn, who studied with both teachers, as many other actors did, concluded: "Stella stresses imagination and Lee stresses reality. You use Stella's imagination to get to Lee's reality. They are finally talking about the same thing." 'You Can't Be Boring'         Miss Adler demanded not only craftsmanship but also self-awareness, calling it the key to an actor's sense of fulfillment. When students failed to understand roles, she acted them out, insisting: "You can't be boring. Life is boring. The weather is boring. Actors must not be boring."         "Get a stage tone, darling, an energy," she advised, "         Never         go on stage without your motor running."         Stanislavsky, she said, created a way for actors to bring the truth to audiences to lift their spirits and enrich their lives. One student accused Miss Adler of expecting too much of young people who "haven't gone out in the world and done all that experiencing she talks about." But most of her students shared the view of another who concluded, "Stella Adler taught me more in five minutes today than any of my other teachers have taught me in five years."         Besides teaching principles of characterization and script analysis at her school, Miss Adler had been an adjunct professor of acting at the Yale School of Drama and for many years headed the undergraduate drama department at New York University. Born to a Stage Family         Stella Adler was born in Manhattan, on Feb. 10, 1901, the youngest daughter of Jacob Pavlovitch Adler and the former Sara Levitzky. The Russian immigrant couple, who led the Independent Yiddish Art Company, were the leading classical Yiddish stage tragedians in the United States. Stella's five siblings, most notably Luther, were also actors.         She started on the stage in 1905 at the Grand Street Theater on the Lower East Side. Over the years, she played both girls' and boys' roles and then ingenues in a wide variety of classical and contemporary plays in this country and abroad.         Her work schedule allowed little time for schooling, but when possible she studied at public schools and New York University. She was introduced to Stanislavsky's theories in 1925 when she began taking courses at the American Laboratory Theater school, founded by Richard Boleslavski and Maria Ouspenskaya, former members of the Moscow Art Theater.         In the Group Theater, Miss Adler won high praise for performances in such realistic dramas as "Success Story" by John Howard Lawson and two seminal Clifford Odets plays, "Awake and Sing!" and "Paradise Lost." She was also hailed for directing the touring company of Odets's "Golden Boy." 'More to Give to People'         Recalling her decade with the company, she deplored above all a dearth of good roles for women in what she regarded essentially as "a man's theater aimed at plays for men." But she credited the company with evoking in her an idealism that shaped her later career. "I knew that I had it in me to be more creative, had much more to give to people," she said. "It was the Group Theater that gave me my life."         She also appeared in three films: "Love on Toast" (1938), "Shadow of the Thin Man" (1941) and "My Girl Tisa" (1948). Her later stage roles included a fiery lion tamer in a 1946 revival of the drama "He Who Gets Slapped" and, in London, an eccentric mother in a 1961 black comedy, "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad." Among the plays she directed was a 1956 revival of the Paul Green-Kurt Weill antiwar musical "Johnny Johnson."         Miss Adler restated her theories in "Stella Adler on Acting," published by Bantam Books in 1988. In an interview in The New York Times, she said she hoped the book would "help actors who had no foundation and no place to get a foundation, and no culture in which a foundation was encouraged." In the past, she had often deplored the highly commercialized Broadway theater, the growing cult of the director and what she termed the "thoughtless, naturalistic" style of most American actors. Her lectures on playwrights and script interpretation are to be published by Alfred A. Knopf.         For many years Miss Adler lived in a spacious apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan that she had decorated in elegant Italian Renaissance style.         Her third husband, Mitchell Wilson, a physicist and novelist, died in 1973. Her previous marriages, to Horace Elea scheff and Harold Clurman, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen, of Manhattan; a sister, Julia, of Englewood, N.J., and two grandchildren.         Funeral services will be private. The family said a memorial service would be held later.       
         Vivienne Segal, a musical-comedy star who appeared on Broadway in "The Desert Song," "No, No, Nanette," and "Pal Joey," died yesterday in Los Angeles. She was 95 years old and lived in Beverly Hills.         She died of heart failure, said Robert Sidney, a friend.         Miss Segal was born in Philadelphia, where she studied voice. She made her operatic debut in 1915 singing the title role of "Carmen" at the Academy of Music in Philadelphia. The next year she took the leading role in "The Blue Paradise" at the Casino Theater in New York City, a show with which she toured for two years. On returning to New York, she appeared in many reviews, musicals and operettas, including "The Little Whopper" and "The Yankee Princess." In 1924, she was featured in the "Ziegfeld Follies." As the 'Fair Young Girl'         The roles capitalized on her fresh-faced beauty and sweet voice. "Just because I was little and could sing and wasn't too bad to look at, I was called a prima donna and was cast repeatedly in operettas and musical comedies as the fair young girl who was good and noble and got what she deserved," Miss Segal complained to an interviewer in 1940.         If Miss Segal found her roles limiting, audiences in the 1920's and 30's doted on her in musical confections like "Florida Girl," "The Desert Song," "The Chocolate Soldier," "Music in the Air," "The Three Musketeers" and "No, No, Nanette."         Miss Segal made her film debut in 1927 in an early sound short, singing excerpts from "Sweethearts" and "Maytime." She also appeared in "Song of the West," "Golden Dawn," "Bride of the Regiment" and "Viennese Nights," all made in 1930, and in "The Cat and the Fiddle" (1934). She later told an interviewer that she went on strike to protest the saccharine roles she was given. A Change in Style         In 1938, the lyricist Lorenz Hart came to the rescue, offering her the role of a cynical countess in "I Married an Angel" on Broadway. "He was the only one who really got me out of a rut of playing sweet-faced ingenues and taught me how to play comedy," she told an interviewer in the early 1950's.         Two years later came her breakthrough role, as the hard-boiled Vera Simpson in "Pal Joey." Describing her show-stopping number, "Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered," Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times wrote, "In a singularly sweet voice she sings some scabrous lyrics by Lorenz Hart to one of Richard Rodgers' most haunting tunes."         After appearing in the Richard Rodgers revival of "A Connecticut Yankee" (1943) and in "Great to Be Alive!" (1950), she did a reprise of her role in "Pal Joey" in 1952, for which she was named best actress in a musical by the New York Drama Critics.         On television she appeared in "Studio One" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents."         Her first marriage, to Robert D. Ames, an actor, ended in divorce. In 1950, she married Hubbell Robinson Jr., a vice president of CBS. He died in 1974.         She is survived by a sister, Louise Paget Kowalski of Los Angeles.
