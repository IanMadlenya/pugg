         Katharine Homer Fryer, an artist, teacher and writer who devoted much of her later life to the mentally disturbed, died Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 89 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         At her death, she was president of the Schizophrenia Foundation of New York, which provides information on alternative treatments for the illness. She headed the foundation since 1969, shortly after its creation.         She also was director emeritus of the Fryer Research Center, an outpatient clinic in the former Murray Hill Hospital on East 40th Street in Manhattan. It offers a biochemical-nutritional approach to emotional and mental conditions, like schizophrenia and depression, as well as physical disorders.         She founded the nonprofit center in 1971 to help people who could not otherwise afford such treatment, and remained its director until a few months ago. Her daughter and successor, Dr. Kathy Fryer, estimated yesterday that the center had served more than 10,000 people and their families.         Mrs. Fryer's dedication stemmed in large part from living with mental illness in her immediate family. One of her five daughters, Barbara, committed suicide in 1968 at age 31, after spending 10 years in a succession of treatments for schizophrenia.         In a new book, ''The Story of Barbara,'' Mrs. Fryer wrote of her daughter's condition, which might have had a different outcome with the alternative treatments for schizophrenia emerging then. The book is to be published by Rivercross Publishing later this year.         An earlier book was ''Kathy: A Mother's True Story of a Young Girl's Fight to Regain Health'' (Dutton, 1956). It told of her daughter Kathy's successful emergence from a mysterious ailment that befell her at 13 and a mother's years of searching for the right diagnosis and cure.         Mrs. Fryer wrote of the ''unexpected, miraculous'' deliverance when Kathy's condition was recognized and swiftly overcome. It proved to be a complex case of severe thyroid deficiency aggravated by psychological problems.         Mrs. Fryer published a second book in 1994, ''Till Death Do Us Part,'' on life with her husband, Dr. Douglas Fryer, a pioneer in industrial psychology and a prolific author, whom she married in 1934. A former head of the Department of Psychology at New York University, he died in 1960.         Katharine Homer was born in New York City to two well-known parents, Sidney Homer, a composer of chamber music and songs, and Louise Homer, a Metropolitan Opera contralto. In the 1920's, she studied piano, singing and painting under distinguished teachers at the Curtis Institute of Music, Mannes College of Music and the Arts League in New York, and at l'Ecole Julienne in Paris.         For several years, she traveled as her mother's accompanist before touring on her own as a solo pianist and with chamber music groups. She exhibited her paintings in New York and Paris.         In 1932, she organized a 50-member girls' choir in Scarsdale, N.Y., and directed it until 1951. She also organized and directed an adult choir in Rye, N.Y., in the 1960's.         All along, until her work at the foundation and center became a primary occupation, she privately taught piano, singing and painting. She also served stints as a piano teacher at the Manhattan School of Music in the 1930's, and more recently at the Brearley School.         Besides Dr. Fryer, a Manhattan resident, she is survived by three other daughters, Dr. Judith Shedden, Anne Eddis and Dr. Sarah Leibowitz, all of Manhattan, and six grandchildren.       
         Elspeth Huxley, a witty and energetic journalist and author of more than 30 books, including memoirs, biographies, crime stories and novels, many inspired by her childhood in colonial Kenya, died on Jan. 10 in a nursing home in Tetbury, in Gloucestershire, England, a family friend said. She was 89.         Although her eclectic literary output reflected an extraordinary range of interests, Mrs. Huxley was perhaps best known for a 1959 work of autobiographical fiction, ''The Flame Trees of Thika,'' which was based on her early life among white settlers on her father's coffee plantation. Although some Kenyans denounced it as an apologia for colonial rule, the book was widely praised for its rich sense of humor, its affectionate personal portraits and its gentle evocation of life in a singular place. ''The Flame Trees of Thika'' became an immensely popular best seller, and in 1981 was made into a television series in Britain. The next year  it was shown on public television in the United States.         Elspeth Josceline Huxley was born in July 1907, the only child of Maj. Josceline Grant, a Scot, and his formidable wife, the former Nellie Grosvenor. Her father, whose failed business schemes included a plan to develop a new kind of motorcar, was a ''gentle, humorous, dreamy person whose dreams never came true,'' she once said. Her mother was a daughter of Lord Stalbridge, who, despite being the younger brother of the first Duke of Westminster, had little money.         In any case, no money came to the family. When she was 5, her family  moved to Kenya, taking possession of a 500-acre coffee farm that Major Grant had bought on a whim in the bar of a Nairobi hotel. They arrived on an ox cart, worked full time on the plantation and had major swings in financial fortune; when they ran out of money for gas, for instance, they had to use oxen to pull the farm truck.         For her part, she was sometimes taught at home and sometimes in school. She had little choice, she later remembered, but ''to fall back on old copies of the Field, manuals of instruction on everything from lace-making to the erection of simple stills, and the volumes of a pocket encyclopedia in minute type.'' At one point she was sent to school in England, but the school sent her home in 1919 after it discovered that she was running numbers on the Derby horse race.         While still a teen-ager, she discovered that she could use her writing talent to make money. Her first published article, in a magazine called The Magician Monthly, was about a magic trick of her own invention. Later, under the pseudonym Bamboo, she wrote a polo column for The East African Monthly, answering readers' questions despite her ignorance about the game. By the time she was 17, she had had 65 articles published in Kenyan newspapers, some of them illustrated with her own photographs.         In 1925, she went to England, earning an agriculture degree from Reading University. Thanks to a wealthy uncle, she also studied agriculture at Cornell University in the United States. Her interest in farming remained throughout her life, and in 1960 she published ''Brave New Victuals: An Inquiry Into Modern Farm Production,'' in which she questioned the increasing reliance on artificial farming methods.         Major Grant and his wife, now the owners of a pig and maize farm, had hoped that their daughter would eventually return to Kenya. But attracted to journalism, she wrote dozens of articles for British magazines and newspapers and took a job for $:5 a week as a press officer at the Empire Marketing Board in England. The job evaporated during the Depression, but in 1931, she married her boss, Gervas Huxley, chief of the publicity department.         She soon had an opportunity to indulge her love of travel: Huxley, a grandson of the humanist Thomas Henry Huxley and a cousin of Aldous, the author, was appointed head of the Ceylon Tea Propaganda Board, a job that required him to travel around the world, encouraging people to drink tea.         In 1935, Mrs. Huxley published her first book, a biography of Lord Delamere, a white settler who revolutionized large-scale farming in Kenya. The book, ''White Man's Country: Lord Delamere and the Making of Kenya,'' was widely regarded as an authoritative account of colonial eastern Africa. More books followed at a rapid pace, including three detective novels and ''Red Strangers'' (1939), a novel that told the story of white settlement from the view of several generations of native Kenyans.         During World War II, the Huxleys returned to England, settling on a pig and dairy farm in the Wiltshire countryside, where they remained the rest of their lives. Mrs. Huxley worked for a time for the BBC's propaganda department, and in 1948  helped to establish the East African Literature Bureau, which worked to publish books by Africans.         In 1959 her ''Flame Trees of Thika'' appeared, followed in 1962 by a sequel, ''On the Edge of the Rift.'' Mrs. Huxley returned to the same themes in 1988 with a memoir, ''Out in the Midday Sun: My Kenya.'' In a review in The New York Times, Michiko Kakutani wrote, ''It makes us appreciate the peculiar mixture of courage, rashness, perseverance, idealism and opportunism that brought such a varied group of people to this beautiful, dangerous land.''         Mrs. Huxley was made a Commander of the British Empire in 1962. Her husband died in 1971; she is survived by their son, Charles, and  three grandsons.         Mrs. Huxley attributed much of her energy, sense of humor and intelligence to her mother, who had, among other things, compiled a Swahili-English dictionary that was published by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. (The dictionary was less than comprehensive and,  Mrs. Huxley later said, ''It contained not very useful phrases like 'The idle slaves are scratching themselves' ''). In 1980, she published a collection of her mother's letters along with a biographical essay, in ''Nellie: Letters From Africa.''         As the African nationalist movement gathered steam, Mrs. Huxley wrote a number of articles defending white settlers and colonial rule. She later wrote with lucid sympathy about the challenges facing the newly independent nations under majority rule.         Among Mrs. Huxley's other books  are a country diary about life in Wiltshire and biographies of Florence Nightingale and the Antarctic explorer Robert Scott. Her last book, a biography of Scott's son, the naturalist Peter Scott, was written when she was 83. Energetic to the end, she last visited Africa in 1995, gardened enthusiastically, took an hourlong walk every day and corresponded with a wide circle of friends and acquaintances.         She also took on myriad causes, protesting the erosion of the countryside and the disappearance of rural post offices, for instance, while espousing euthanasia and the protection of rhinoceroses. But in her last Who's Who entry, she described her recreations as ''resting and gossip.''       
         Mary Bancroft, a Boston Brahmin colleen who cut a coquettish swath through 20th-century history, bewitching men of power even as she did brilliant work as an American spy in Switzerland in World War II, died on Jan. 10 at her Fifth Avenue apartment. She was 93.         If Mary Bancroft had not existed, a hack novelist would surely have invented her, or tried.         Dime store fiction could undoubtedly have accommodated her cliche origins as the daughter of a patrician, Harvard-trained lawyer and a distinctly declasse Irish girl, who died in childbirth, setting up her father's marriage to a disapproving, if not quite wicked, stepmother.         He left his daughter to be reared by a paternal grandmother with such a haughty and virulent disdain for the Irish that it was years before Miss Bancroft learned that the woman had herself been an Irish working girl before marrying into the august Bancroft family.         It would have taken a Dickens to invent Nolan, the Bancroft coachman who became Miss Bancroft's constant childhood companion, sharing her delight in the day's news, especially of war and disaster.         And a Dickens could even have contrived for her father's second wife to be the stepdaughter of Clarence Barron, the short, rotund powerhouse owner of The Wall Street Journal who encouraged his step-granddaughter to meet and study people of all walks of life, ''even gamblers and crooks,'' and who gave her what became her credo as a sometime journalist and spy: ''Facts are not the truth but only indicate where the truth may lie.''         A novelist might have foreseen that a daring, restless woman would find Smith College such a bore that she would escape after a year into what turned out to be a stultifying marriage to a teen-age chum and then divorce and seek refuge in another loveless marriage, this time to a Swiss businessman.         But it would have taken a remarkable visionary to have imagined Miss Bancroft's later life as an accomplished spy, a woman with such penetrating intelligence, infallible intuition and boundless verve -- not to mention legs that rarely failed to draw a second glance -- that her intellectual, emotional or romantic conquests included Carl Jung, Woody Allen and Henry R. Luce.         To Jung, the psychologist who became her confidant during her years in Switzerland, her appeal was textbook obvious. In his scheme of things she was an extroverted intuitive, one who had experienced such fierce inter-family battles for her affections as a child that power had become her natural element. She had such an instinctive knack for wielding it, he told her, that men seeking or holding power would cherish her advice, as indeed they did.         Her relationships were often platonic, apparently -- and surprisingly -- including even her postwar fling in New York with Luce, the Time Inc. founder and a legendary ladies' man.         But as her own 1983 book, ''Autobiography of a Spy,'' makes explicit, her wartime romance with Allen Dulles, the American spymaster who laid the groundwork for the Central Intelligence Agency with his brilliant successes in Switzerland in World War II, was as torrid as they come.         At the time, Miss Bancroft's second marriage was beginning to unravel, and Mr. Dulles, whose wife was in the United States, was looking for recruits to interview the hundreds of refugees, adventurers and spies who poured into officially neutral Switzerland from every corner of wartime Europe.         Impressed with the insightful analyses of German articles and speeches she had prepared for one of his associates, he sought her out, quickly concluding that she would be an ideal operative, and more.         ''It should work out very well,'' he blurted out on their second meeting. ''We can let the work cover the romance -- and the romance cover the work.'' The remark might have seemed startling considering that the subject of romance had not been mentioned, but Mr. Dulles was as perceptive as his recruit. The logic appealed to her, and so did he.         In what became a regular routine, she would help him prepare his legendary nightly telephone reports to Washington at his home in Bern, and then the two would engage in what she called ''a bit of dalliance.''         As a spy, she interviewed and sized up visitors from Germany and German-occupied territory, sometimes with startling results. One contact  provided the first inkling that a previously unknown figure named Joseph Broz had become the man to deal with in Yugoslavia, where he was known as Tito.         When her German maid's brother-in-law wrote from the Russian front asking for an aluminum spoon, noting that his wife had told him none was available in Germany, she picked up a critical clue about the war's effects on German production.         By far her most important work was with Hans Bernd Gisevius, a top officer of German military intelligence, who was not only a key figure in a vast plot to kill Hitler and set up a civilian democracy but who, well in advance of what turned out to be a bungled assassination attempt on July 20, 1944, had supplied a manuscript detailing the conspiracy.         Miss Bancroft was entrusted with translating the manuscript into English (Gisevius wanted it published immediately after the coup), but her real job was to make sure he was not a double agent (she concluded he was not) and then to elicit and pass on the detailed information he supplied about the day-to-day shifts of power and strategy within the German Government.         After the war, her daughter said, Miss Bancroft settled in New York, wrote a few novels, lectured on Jung, became active in local Democratic politics, became friends with Woody Allen and became Luce's confidant.         When her daughter, Mary Jane, married Horace Taft, the son of Senator Robert A. Taft of Ohio, the wedding pictures were published in Life, -- ''a present from Luce,'' Mrs. Taft said.         In addition to her daughter, of Atlanta, Miss Bancroft is survived by 6 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Dorathi Bock Pierre, a theatrical publicist and dance writer, died on Jan. 2 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 96.         During a long career, Ms. Pierre served as press representative for tours by such groups as the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, American Ballet Theater, the Old Vic, the Royal Shakespeare Company, the Comedie Francaise and the Royal Dramatic Theater of Sweden.         A champion of the arts in Southern California, she served as public relations director for such Los Angeles organizations as the Greek Theater Association, the Hollywood Bowl, the Free Shakespeare Festival and the Los Angeles Ballet.         Ms. Pierre contributed articles to The American Dancer and Dance magazine and founded and edited The Journal of Educational Dance from 1938 to 1942.         Ms. Pierre, whose father was Richard W. Bock, a sculptor, was born in Chicago. At 16, she danced with the Michel Fokine Ballet. She moved to Los Angeles after marrying Jacques J. Pierre, a theatrical producer. In 1991 she edited ''Memoirs of an American Artist: The Sculptor Richard W. Bock,'' a book about her father.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Myfanwy Piper, an English art critic and the librettist for three of Benjamin Britten's operas, died last Saturday at Fawley Bottom, the farmhouse home near Henley, England, that was a center of artistic activity in the 1940's and 50's. She was 85.         Ms. Piper's most enduring work is the deftly written libretto she supplied for Britten's ''Turn of the Screw'' in 1954. It was, in fact, Ms. Piper's suggestion that Britten base on opera on the Henry James novella about a governess who wrestles with a pair of ghosts she believes are corrupting the children in her care.         Ms. Piper had known Britten since the mid-1940's, when her husband, the artist John Piper, designed the sets for several operas, including ''The Rape of Lucretia'' and ''Billy Budd.'' But when she suggested ''The Turn of the Screw'' as a subject, Ms. Piper did not expect to write the libretto herself.         ''I think he turned to me,'' she told Britten's biographer, Humphrey Carpenter, ''because, with the 'Lucretias' and 'Herrings' and the various things which John and I had been through with Ben, he often talked to us about the words. He'd say, 'What am I to do here? I don't like this,' and I was very much aware of the kind of things he didn't like. So although I hadn't got any qualifications for writing a libretto, it didn't disturb me.''         But Ms. Piper did, by then, have ample qualifications as a writer. Ms. Piper, whose name was originally  Mary Myfanwy (pronounced mih-VAHN-wih) Evans in London in 1911, she was educated at St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where she pursued interests in art and literature. After discovering the works of Mondrian and Kandinsky during a visit to Paris in 1934, she founded and edited Axis, an English review of abstract art that promoted the British and French avant-garde. She edited the journal from 1935 to 1937.         It was also in 1934 that she met John Piper at a summer painting party in Suffolk. The two married in 1937 and settled at Fawley Bottom, a flint-and-brick farmhouse that quickly became the regular meeting place of a circle of artists, musicians, architects and poets, including Alexander Calder, Kenneth Clark and John Betjeman. Betjeman wrote two poems about Ms. Piper, ''Myfanwy'' and ''Myfanwy at Oxford,'' both published in 1940. Mr. Piper died in 1992.         Besides editing Axis, Ms. Piper edited a book of essays, ''The Painter's Object,'' and wrote a biography of Frances Hodgkins for the Penguin Modern Painters series. From the late 1930's through the early 50's, she worked mainly as her husband's assistant and brought up their four children, of which one son and two daughters survive.         There was a long hiatus between ''The Turn of the Screw'' and Ms. Piper's next libretto for Britten, but in 1968, when Britten was commissioned to write an opera for television, he settled on another Henry James story, ''Owen Wingrave,'' and revived the collaboration that had worked so well in ''The Turn of the Screw.''         Soon after ''Owen Wingrave'' had its premiere, in 1971, Britten invited Ms. Piper to write a libretto for what would be his final opera, ''Death in Venice,'' based on the Thomas Mann novel.         Ms. Piper also wrote a play, ''The Diary of a Seducer,'' based on Kierkegaard, as well as the librettos for Malcolm Williamson's ''Easter'' and several operas by the Welsh composer Alun Hoddinot, including ''What the Old Man Does Is Always Right,'' ''The Rajah's Diamond'' and ''The Trumpet Major.''       
         Jeane Dixon, the astrologer and self-described psychic who gained fame by apparently predicting President John F. Kennedy's death, died on Saturday in Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. She was 79 and a longtime resident of Washington.         The cause was cardiopulmonary arrest, the Associated Press reported a hospital spokeswoman as saying. The spokeswoman, Jean Vincent, said the hospital had been asked not to elaborate.         In 1956, Parade magazine quoted Mrs. Dixon as forecasting that a Democratic President, elected in 1960, would die in office. She said he would be tall and young and have thick brown hair and blue eyes.         The journal Current Biography reported in 1973, ''She contends that she actually told her interviewers that he would be assassinated but they refused to print it.''         Mrs. Dixon, who was a devout Roman Catholic, also said she had based her prophecy on a vision she had in 1952 while she was praying.         So great did her fame become after Mr. Kennedy was assassinated, in 1963, that she became known as ''the Seeress of Washington,'' and two books about her were best sellers in the 1960's: ''A Gift of Prophecy'' (1965) by Ruth Montgomery and ''My Life and Prophecies'' (1969) by Mrs. Dixon as told to Rene Noorbergen.         Mrs. Dixon, the writer of a syndicated astrology column (her zodiac sign was Capricorn), also wrote other books, including ''Yesterday, Today and Forever'' (1976, Andrews & McMeel).         Skeptics pointed out that she had said, in the summer of 1992, that the stars pointed definitely toward the re-election of President George Bush. But that fall Bill Clinton beat him by a comfortable margin. One headline said, ''Stars Go Blank for Dixon.''         She predicted that World War III would begin in 1958 over the offshore Chinese islands of Quemoy and Matsu. She also said that Walter Reuther, the president of the United Auto Workers, would run for President in 1964 and that the Soviets would get the first man to the moon.         Stefan Kanfer, a writer on cultural topics, wrote in The New York Times Book Review in 1992: ''The real summa of tabloid sensitivity is not found on earth but in the supernovas. Horoscopes, signs of the zodiac, predictions by Jeane Dixon -- these are the vital signs of shlock.''         Mrs. Dixon was born Jeane L. Pinckert in Medford, Wis., the daughter of a businessman who was in the lumber industry. She grew up in California. Admirers said she had a talent for foreseeing the future, which she ascribed to God. When she was 8 years old, the story goes, her mother took her to see a gypsy soothsayer who said Jeane had a gift for prophesying. The child's mother encouraged her in those efforts.         In 1939, she married James L. Dixon, who went on to be president of James L. Dixon & Company Realtors in Washington. She helped him in the business and also predicted individual's futures and future events, acquiring a local reputation for accuracy.         Information about survivors was not immediately available.       
         Edith Thacher Hurd, whose books on subjects from the earth to whales to firemen reached several generations of readers learning their way around the printed page, died on Saturday in Walnut Creek, Calif. She was 86.         Mrs. Hurd wrote some 75 books for elementary-school children covering the range of juvenile curiosity. Much of her work grew from a creative symbiosis with her husband, Clement Hurd, the artist and illustrator.         In the early 1930's, the couple were just out of college, she from Radcliffe, he from Yale and art school in Paris. They met in New York City while continuing their education at Bank Street College, and married in 1939.         She wrote and he drew the pictures for almost 50 books until their last collaboration on ''The Earth is Not Flat'' (1986). It was meant as a companion to a book Mr. Hurd had illustrated decades earlier, Gertrude Stein's ''The Earth Is Round,'' published in 1938. Clement Hurd died in 1988 at the age of 80.         Mrs. Hurd was born in Kansas City, Mo. At Bank Street College she also met Margaret Wise Brown, with whom she wrote several children's books under the joint pseudonym of Juniper Sage.         These included ''The Man in the Manhole and the Fix-It Men'' (1946), ''Five Little Firemen'' (1948), ''Two Little Miners'' (1949) and ''The Little Fat Policeman'' (1950). Clement Hurd also did illustrations for Mrs. Brown, who had persuaded him to enroll at Bank Street to try picture-book illustrations.         Mrs. Hurd's first solo writing effort, ''Hurry Hurry,'' was published in 1938 by W.R. Scott, a pioneer modern children's book publisher. A follow-up, ''Hurry Hurry: A Story of What Happened to a Hurrier,'' appeared in 1947.         The Hurds became regular contributors to the Harper ''I Can Read'' series. The titles there included ''Johnny Lion's Book,'' ''Come and Have Fun,'' ''Stop Stop'' and ''No Funny Business.''         Other titles included ''Christmas Eve,'' ''The Day the Sun Danced'' and ''Wilson's World,'' a cautionary environmental tale about a boy who paints a world but must draw it over again to make it better.         Mrs. Hurd also wrote science books for young readers, some of which were also illustrated by her husband. They included ''The Blue Heron Tree,'' ''Rain and the Valley,'' ''The Mother Whale'' and ''The Mother Deer.''         She is survived by a son, John Thacher Hurd of Berkeley, Calif., himself a writer and illustrator of children's books; and a brother, Nicholas Thacher, of San Francisco.       
         Ursula Niebuhr, the founder and longtime chairwoman of the department of religion at Barnard College, died on Friday at her home in Stockbridge, Mass. She was 89 and the widow of the theologian Reinhold Niebuhr.         Although she was clearly upstaged by her renowned husband, who taught at the Union Theological Seminary, Mrs. Niebuhr's own scholarship was so well regarded that in the 1940's she was asked by the president of Barnard to create a department of religion there. She accepted and remained as associate professor and department chairwoman until her retirement two decades later.         A native of Southampton, England, she was sent to Oxford to study at St. Hugh's College, then regarded as little more than a glorified finishing school. She enhanced its reputation considerably when she graduated with honors in history and theology and became the first woman to win a fellowship to the Union Theological Seminary in New York.         When a friend proposed to introduce her to Mr. Niebuhr, a faculty member, she was skeptical, her daughter, Elizabeth Sifton, recalled yesterday. ''Oh, no,'' the friend said, ''you'll love him,'' and she did.         They were married in 1931, embarking on an intellectual and emotional collaboration marked by animated debates that continued until her husband's death in 1971. By then, her daughter noted, their theological differences had dwindled to liturgical quibbles between Mrs. Niebuhr's Episcopalian ideas and her husband's Congregationalist notions.         In the introduction to his last book, Mr. Niebuhr said he could no longer tell where his ideas left off and hers began. After his death, Mrs. Niebuhr returned the favor, editing two collections of his writings.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, Mrs. Niebuhr is survived by a son, Richard, of Stockbridge; a sister, Barbara Moravec of Sutton, England, and three grandsons.         Correction:  January 13, 1997, Monday         An obituary in some editions yesterday about Ursula Niebuhr, the founder of Barnard College's religion department, misstated the given name of her surviving son. He is Christoper, not Richard.       
         Mollie Panter-Downes, whose quiet, compelling accounts of everyday British life brought England alive for two generations of readers of The New Yorker, died on Jan. 22 in a nursing home near her longtime home in Surrey. She was 90 and had written The New Yorker's ''Letter from London'' from 1939 to 1984.         Although she wrote verses, stories, plays and several well-received novels, Miss Panter-Downes considered herself more journalist than novelist. In fact she was neither. She was, rather, just what her column's title proclaimed: a letter writer, albeit one with a remarkable eye for detail and a talent for the telling observation.         Indeed, she could have been any American's English cousin writing chatty but shrewdly observant letters that illuminated passing political foibles and great events alike through their reflection in the lives of bus drivers, housewives, shop girls and farmers.         From the time her first ''Letter from London,'' appeared in The New Yorker in the first week of World War II in September 1939, Miss Panter-Downes gave Americans a ground zero view of world events, sometimes with a folksy blend of  American reference points and British nomenclature.         Describing the first jittery days of the war, for example, when sirens often sounded in shrill false alarm, all London, she wrote, ''felt like a little boy who stuffs his fingers in his ears on the Fourth of July only to discover that the cannon cracker has not gone off after all.''         Her expertise in ordinary life was not feigned. Shunning the literary life of London, she lived with her husband and two daughters in a 15th century Tudor house on a pig farm 40 miles south of London. And for all her literary output she was something close to a typical country housewife, one who did her own shopping, cooking and canning.         She made weekly visits to London, but believed that living at a certain distance from the city gave her letters a beneficial perspective.         Her letters, which appeared weekly during the first years and at irregular but frequent intervals from then on, began almost by accident. As the war loomed, Miss Panter-Downes later recalled, The New Yorker's Paris correspondent, Janet Flanner, was ''trapped in New York.'' Desperate for an on-scene voice from Europe, Harold Ross, the magazine's editor, recalling that Miss Panter-Downes had submitted a piece the year before about English families taking in Jewish refugee children, asked her to fill the gap, and she obliged.         Her letters were so well received that her first year's correspondence was published as a collection, ''Letter From England,'' in October 1940.         With only about 5,000 of the New Yorker's half-million or so readers living in England, Miss Panter-Downes became more famous in the United States than in her own homeland, although in England she was far from unknown.         The daughter of an Army officer who was killed in World War I when she was 8, Miss Panter-Downes was born in London and grew up in Essex. She burst on the literary scene at the age of 16, when her first novel, ''The Shoreless Sea,'' was published to generally admiring, if somewhat startled, reviews.         She later wrote several other novels, including ''One Fine Day,'' typically, about an ordinary midlands family, which was published in 1947 and reissued by Virago in 1986.         In addition to her letters, Miss Panter-Downes took on occasional other assignments for The New Yorker, including one, about an English settlement in India, that led to a book, ''Ooty Preserved: A Victorian Hill Station in India,'' published in 1967.         Miss Panter-Downes, whose letters were discontinued as a regular New Yorker feature in 1984, continued writing for the magazine until 1986.         She is survived by her husband of 70 years, Clare Robinson, 93; two daughters, Virginia and Diana Baer; five grandchildren, and four great grand-children.       
         Jean D. Hewitt, a former food writer and home economist for The New York Times and an early advocate of natural foods, died on Sunday in the Bon Secours-Venice Hospital in Venice, Fla. She was 71 and made her home in Venice.         The cause was pneumonia, the family said.         Mrs. Hewitt planned The Times's test kitchen and was in charge of it from its opening in 1969. At the time, a number of newspapers employed home economics graduates as food writers and set up kitchens on the premises to test food and recipes.         In 1971, Mrs. Hewitt made headlines across the country when she tested the recipe for Tricia Nixon's wedding cake. She found the lemon-flavored cake inedible -- ''mush on the outside and soup on the inside'' -- and wrote that it left the oven in a mess. The problem, she decided, was too many egg whites and not enough yolks. She also suggested that the oven temperature be increased and the baking time lengthened.         The White House chef countered by saying that he had forgotten to mention that a collar was required for the pan. Later, however, more corrections were made.         In addition to developing and testing recipes, Mrs. Hewitt wrote a number of New York Times Cook Books, including ''Main Dish,'' ''Heritage'' and ''Weekend.'' Her ''Large Type Cook Book'' and ''New Natural Foods Cook Book'' were forerunners in their respective fields, as was her ''International Meatless Cook Book.'' Four of her books received James Beard Food and Beverage Book Awards.         She joined The Times in 1961 as an assistant to Craig Claiborne, the food editor and restaurant reviewer. In addition to those duties, she researched and wrote about food and reviewed New Jersey restaurants.         In 1975, she was named food editor of Family Circle, a Times Company publication, where she wrote more books, including the ''Family Circle Quick and Easy Menu Cook Book.'' She retired in 1993.         Born in Ipswich, England, in 1925, she moved to New York during World War II, after studying at the Westminster School for Chefs in London. She was a charter member of Les Dames d'Escoffier and a lifetime fellow of the Culinary Institute of America.         Mrs. Hewitt held degrees in food and nutrition from the University of London and Columbia University.         Her first husband, Dr. Eric J. Hewitt, whom she married in 1949, died in 1976. In 1983, she married James Blair of Venice, who survives her. She is also survived by two sons, Gordon Hewitt of Annapolis, Md., and Geoffrey Hewitt of Westfield, N.J.         Correction:  February 14, 1997, Friday         An obituary on Tuesday about Jean D. Hewitt, a former food writer and home economist for The New York Times, referred incorrectly to the opening of The Times's test kitchen. It was opened in 1944; Mrs. Hewitt planned and supervised a major renovation in 1969.       
         Emily Hahn, an early feminist and a prolific author who wrote 54 books and more than 200 articles for The New Yorker, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 92, said her daughter, Carola Boxer Vecchio.         Ms. Hahn was known for her writings about her adventurous life in the Far East before World War II and for her books on such diverse subjects as Africa, D. H. Lawrence and apes. (Ms. Hahn kept gibbons.) She also worked as a Hollywood screenwriter during the 1920's.         Over the course of her career, Ms. Hahn wrote about Chinese cooking, about feminism (''Once Upon a Pedestal: An Informal History of Women's Lib,'' 1974) and about diamonds (''Diamond: The Spectacular Story of Earth's Rarest Treasure and Man's Greatest Greed,'' 1956). Another work was ''The Islands: America's Imperial Adventures in the Philippines'' (1981). In her later years, Ms. Hahn wrote several books about animals, including ''Eve and the Apes'' (1988), about women who owned apes. In ''Look Who's Talking'' (1988), she examined communication between beasts, and between beasts and humans.         Emily Hahn was born in St. Louis,  where her father, Isaac Newton Hahn, was a salesman. At a time when few middle-class women had careers, she was determined to be a mining engineer. But her adviser at the University of Wisconsin told her, she once said, that the female mind was ''incapable of grasping mechanics or higher mathematics.'' That remark only hardened her resolve, and she stayed on, graduating in 1926. She is believed to be the first woman to earn a degree in mining engineering at the university. She worked for a year for the Deko Oil Company of St. Louis but grew bored with the work.         Her career as an author began in 1924, when she took a trip across the country in a Model T Ford, and her letters home so captivated her brother-in-law that he sent them to The New Yorker, which bought some of them. In 1930, her first book, ''Seductio ad Absurdum: The Principles and Practices of Seduction -- A Beginner's Handbook,'' was published.         Inspired by Charles A. Lindbergh's solo flight across the Atlantic, Ms. Hahn decided she wanted to be ''free,'' she said, and in 1930 she embarked on a journey to Africa, where she worked in a hospital and lived with a tribe of Pygmies.         In 1935, The New Yorker hired her to be its China correspondent. China was the place, Ms. Hahn once said, that had the greatest impact on her life. She arrived during the period of the Communist revolution and the war against the Japanese, and made the acquaintance of Mao Zedong and Chou En-lai. She also became a confidante of the Soong sisters, one of whom married Sun Yat-sen, another Chiang Kai-shek, and in 1941 published ''The Soong Sisters,'' a biography.         While in China, Ms. Hahn had an affair with Sinmay Zau, an aristocratic intellectual whom she described as her ''cultural and political guide to China.'' She also spent time in opium dens, eventually becoming addicted to the drug, she said.         ''I was young and I thought it was romantic to smoke opium,'' she told The Washington Post. ''I was quite determined. It took me a year or so to become addicted, but I kept at it.'' Later, she said, ''I went to a man who hypnotized me and sure enough, I didn't want it any more.''         In Hong Kong, Ms. Hahn met Maj. Charles Boxer, a British intelligence officer in the Far East. He was already married, but they began an affair. In 1940 she became pregnant. At a time when such pregnancies were often kept secret, she chose not only to keep her baby daughter, Carola, but to proclaim her birth proudly.         Soon after their daughter's birth, Major Boxer was captured by the Japanese and put in a prison camp. For some months, Ms. Hahn brought food to him there, avoiding repatriation by claiming to be Eurasian. But fearing for the safety of her daughter, she fled Hong Kong in 1943. Major Boxer survived his captivity. Ms. Hahn married him in 1945, and they had a second child, Amanda. Ms. Hahn described her wartime romance in her 1944 book, ''China to Me: A Partial Autobiography.''         At The New Yorker, Ms. Hahn became one of the few writers to work for all four of its editors, Harold Ross, William Shawn, Robert Gottlieb and Tina Brown. She and her husband often lived an ocean apart,  with Ms. Hahn, because of British tax laws, spending no more than 91 days a year in England while Major Boxer remained at their home in Little Gaddesden, Hertfordshire.         Ms. Hahn continued writing until the end of her life, including an article about Amanda's dog published this month in a British magazine. In December, Ms. Hahn had her first poem published in The New Yorker, ''Wind Blowing.''         Ms. Hahn is survived by her husband; her daughters, Carola, of  Jackson Heights, Queens, and Amanda, of London; two grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         ''My younger daughter once rebuked me for not being the kind of mother one reads about,'' Ms. Hahn once told an interviewer. ''I asked her what kind that was, and she said, the kind who sits home and bakes cakes. I told her to go and find anybody who sits at home and bakes cakes.''       
         Nora Beloff, a gifted political writer and foreign correspondent who was a trailblazer among women in British journalism, died on Feb. 12. She was 78 and a longtime resident of London.         She had a short illness, said The Associated Press, which reported her death on Feb. 15. The place of her death was not immediately disclosed.         Miss Beloff worked for the national weekly newspaper The Observer from 1948 to 1978. After her death, a former editor of The Observer, Donald Trelford, wrote in The Guardian that she was ''the first female political correspondent of a major British newspaper'' and ''had one of the most distinguished careers any woman has had in British journalism.''         She was The Observer's political correspondent from 1964 to 1976 after being its correspondent in Paris, Washington and Moscow, and also worked as a freelance writer.         At different times, she was expelled from the Soviet Union and from Yugoslavia. Prime Minister Harold Wilson tried in vain to have her dismissed from The Observer after her aggressive reporting about disunity in his Labor Government.         The first of her five books, ''The General Says No: Britain's Exclusion from Europe'' (1963) was praised in a review in The New York Times Book Review by Drew Middleton, then The Times's Paris bureau chief. He said the book ''abounds in clear analyses of complicated situations and in sharp, enduring pictures of persons and situations.''         Miss Beloff was born in London  and received a bachelor's degree in 1940 from Oxford. She was in the political intelligence department of the British Foreign Office in London from 1941 to 1944 and on the staff of British Embassy in Paris in 1944 and 1945.         Turning to journalism, she became a reporter for Reuters in Paris in 1945 and 1946 and Paris correspondent of The Economist from 1946 to 1948. She was a roving correspondent for The Observer from 1976 to 1978.         She married Clifford Makins, former sports editor of The Observer, in 1977. He died in 1990.       
         Pamela Harriman, the United States Ambassador to France, a leading figure in the Democratic Party and for decades one of the most vivacious women on the international scene, died yesterday at the American Hospital in Paris of complications of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 76.         Mrs. Harriman, who was preparing to relinquish her post and return to Washington, suffered the hemorrhage on Monday at the Ritz Hotel in Paris, where she had gone for her usual swim.         She devoted her later years to helping to rebuild the Democratic Party in the 1980's, raising millions of dollars. She was appointed Ambassador by President Clinton in 1993, and was well regarded as a diplomat.         The President yesterday called her an ''extraordinary U.S. ambassador,'' adding, ''She was a source of judgment and inspiration to me, a source of constant good humor and charm and real friendship, and we will miss her very, very much.''         However great her accomplishments, she could never put to rest the legend of the captivating woman who snared some of the world's richest and most attractive men on two continents, marrying three of them.         Along the way she was trailed by a chorus of angry women who repeated tales of her escapades for decades.         Born in England in 1920 into an old aristocracy that no longer counted for much, she ultimately made her way into a new aristocracy of the wealthy and powerful that counted a great deal. She was 19 when she married Randolph Churchill. Within months he went off to war and she found herself at the center of London as a confidante and hostess for her new father-in-law, Winston Churchill. She called him Papa, and he reveled in her company.         Through Winston Churchill she met Max Beaverbrook, the press baron, who became her mentor; Harry Hopkins, Franklin D. Roosevelt's envoy, who became her friend, and W. Averell Harriman, the lend-lease administrator, who became her lover, and, 30 years later, her third husband.         With expenses underwritten by Mr. Harriman, she took up wartime residence in Grosvenor Square, a small parcel of London that became so filled with Americans that she remembered it as Eisenhowerplatz. There she brought prominent Americans and their British allies together for small dinners and raised eyebrows with her numerous liaisons. The most prominent among them were her London neighbor, John Hay (Jock) Whitney, who became the United States Ambassador to Britain, and Edward R. Murrow, the wartime voice of CBS in London.         After the war, divorced and the mother of a son, Winston Spencer Churchill, she moved to Paris where, with her customary energy and resourcefulness, and with the cachet and connections of the Churchill name, she established a glittering place for herself in international high society.         Later she moved on to America, where she charmed, and married, Leland Hayward, the renowned Broadway agent and producer. After Hayward's death Averell Harriman reappeared, and after a brief courtship they married and became the couple that helped reinvigorate the Democratic Party.         As a girl, Pamela Digby was peaches-and-cream pretty, but no great beauty. Taught, as were most girls of her class, that her goal was to marry well, she developed an exceptional ability to beguile men. She enveloped them in her attention, anticipated their every need and locked on them with adoring eyes that suggested genuine interest in their every word. When it was mentioned to one acquaintance that she was lacking a sense of humor, he shrugged and replied, ''Maybe, but she makes you feel you have the best sense of humor in the world.''         One of her biographers, Christopher Ogden, was beguiled himself when he described her on the night in November 1992 when she welcomed Bill Clinton, the new President she had helped to elect, to a dinner reception at her Georgetown house.         ''She looked fabulous, almost breathtaking,'' he wrote in his book ''Life of the Party.''         ''Her smile can appear too practiced but tonight it was wonderfully wise and guileless,'' he wrote. ''Her voice was low with a sexy, croacky catch.''         Not everyone agreed. Sally Bedell Smith, the author of another biography, ''Reflected Glory,'' said in 1996: ''She wanted great wealth and power. These were big ambitions for a person with little to say and no wit, but she had unflagging determination and ruthlessness.''         Mrs. Harriman was quick to deny that she had ever had an agenda. In 1996, in an interview in the Embassy residence in Paris, she said: ''My life, for me, has been free-flowing. I never thought, 'Now I'm here, I want to go there or do that.' I've taken life as it has presented itself to me.''         She bristled at the way she was characterized in the press and said she should not be faulted if the succession of men in her life happened to be rich and influential. ''Those were the people I met,'' she said. ''Everything in life, I believe, is luck and timing.''         Her first bit of luck was to be born, on March 20, 1920, to Edward Kenelm Digby, soon to become the 11th Baron Digby, and his wife, the former Constance Pamela Alice Bruce. She grew up at Minterne Magna, a 50-room stone mansion in Dorset, where despite severe financial pressures, the family's four children were tended to by maids, governesses and tutors.         She grew up in what she called ''a very small, closed society, the last of really 19th-century culture.''         The Startling Remaking Of a Country Girl         ''It's almost incredible to people I work with today,'' she said last year, ''to realize I was born in a world where a woman was totally controlled by men. I mean, you got married and there was kind of no alternative. The boys were allowed to go off to school. The girls were kept home, educated by governesses. It never sort of occurred to me in the first, I suppose, 20 years of my life that a woman could move from the position that pre-World War II women like me were in.''         She received a certificate in domestic science in 1936 from the Downham School in Hertfordshire. Then she was sent to Paris and Munich for ''finishing.'' As she approached the social season of 1938, when she was presented at court, she was still considered an unfashionable country girl.         Then Winston Churchill's only son, Randolph, well educated but spoiled and trailing a reputation for brilliance, arrogance, extravagance and drunkenness, took her to dinner and proposed on their first date, having already been turned down, according to the London gossips, by a number of other women. He was going off to war, told friends he was sure he would die, and wanted to produce an heir.         They were married on Oct. 4, 1939. ''I was absolutely sincere in wanting it to work,'' she said, ''and I still believe that if it hadn't been wartime, that marriage probably would have worked. I mean there's been too much exaggeration about Randolph being a drunk and Randolph being this and Randolph being that. He was his own worst enemy and very difficult to be his father's son and all that, but he had many, many admirable qualities.''         After following her husband to a succession of army camps, Pamela Churchill was taken under her father-in-law's wing. The Prime Minister found her enchanting. She brought him the London gossip and played the card game bezique with him into the early hours of the morning when he couldn't sleep. And he was elated that she was bearing his grandchild and namesake.         ''Nobody in today's generation can fully understand what it was like to be part of the last probably great war,'' she said, and years later she remembered it as the most exciting time of her life.         During bombing raids she shared the shelter under 10 Downing Street with the Prime Minister and his wife, Clementine. Above ground there were dinners and weekends with world leaders at Chequers or at Lord Beaverbrook's, tea dances at Claridges and the Dorchester, officers to entertain at the Churchill Club and Roosevelt's envoy, Harry Hopkins, to look after.         A Fling With Aly Khan, And Other Romances         After the war she became a reporter for Lord Beaverbrook's Daily Express and Evening Standard, cabling news about politics, the arts and the social scene from London, New York, Palm Beach, Montego Bay, Paris and the south of France.         She looked back at those postwar years as a time to ''catch up on all the things that I might have done if I hadn't had those six years of war,'' she said. ''I wanted to discover a lot of things that I had not done at the age of 19.''         She had a fling with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the Aga Kahn, and after the breakup of her marriage to Randolph Churchill she began her new life in Paris. There she met the Italian industrialist Gianni Agnelli and fell in love, and during their five-year romance provided him with connections in England and America. She converted to Catholicism in what some said was an effort to be a more acceptable bride to the heir to the Fiat fortune. But that was not to be.         After their breakup there were five years as mistress to Baron Elie de Rothschild of the French banking family. Because he was married to one of the most well-liked women in Paris society, Mrs. Churchill made enemies. But she had admirers, too, among them Stavros Niarchos, the Greek shipping tycoon.         ''I'm censured for having had friends,'' Mrs. Harriman said in 1996, assailing the many books and articles written about her, ''and, of course, more friends than I've ever really had. Men friends. The amount of people that I read about that I've slept with that I've never slept with -- I mean it's extraordinary!''         She insisted that she was not looking for a rich husband, saying of her biographers and detractors: ''The one thing that they've all missed is the fact that having once been married I said to myself, 'I don't have to get married again.' I was bruised. What annoys me, especially in this world where women are equal with men, why do they all take the same tack, that people didn't marry me? Nobody's ever thought that I didn't want to marry.''         But then she did marry, in 1960. During a visit to New York she was introduced to Leland Hayward, the Broadway producer of such hit musicals as ''South Pacific'' and ''The Sound of Music.'' A friend asked her to go to the theater with Hayward, whose wife, Slim, later known in New York society as Lady Keith, was in Europe. It was not long before Hayward proposed.         She showered him with what Sally Bedell Smith characterized as ''geisha-like devotion.'' She cooked chicken hash on a hot plate when they were out on the road and organized splendid houses in New York and Westchester, but theirs was a complicated marriage. Hayward had three children from his marriage to the actress Margaret Sullavan, who committed suicide in 1960, 11 years after their divorce. The children loved their mother and their first stepmother, but not their father's new wife.         When Hayward died of a stroke in 1971, there was a feud over his will. His daughter Brooke Hayward even suggested in her book, ''Haywire,'' that her last stepmother absconded with a string of pearls her mother had left to her. Pamela Harriman insisted that she knew nothing about the pearls.         As the Wife of Harriman, She Buoys the Democrats         Five months after Hayward's death, at a dinner party given by Katharine Graham, the publisher of The Washington Post, there was a serendipitous reunion with W. Averell Harriman, who had been widowed the year before. A month later Pamela Digby Churchill Hayward, 51, married the 79-year-old former Governor of New York, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, and Harry Truman's choice to be President of the United States.         Although Harriman was the heir to the Union Pacific Railroad fortune, he was famously parsimonious. With his new wife, however, he was generous, and began to live up to his means. She fixed up his houses. She became an American citizen and adopted his interests in the Soviet Union and, more exuberantly, in the Democratic Party.         As Mrs. Averell Harriman, she gave fund-raising dinners for Democratic candidates in the 1970's. But it was the election of Ronald Reagan and the big Republican gains in Congress in the 1980 election that galvanized both Harrimans to action. To resuscitate the Democratic Party, they agreed to form their own political action committee, which quickly became known as PamPAC. Mrs. Harriman surrounded herself with advisers and learned quickly. She built up her political curriculum vitae, giving speeches and, with the help of friends, writing Op-Ed pieces for The New York Times and The Washington Post.         The Harriman house in Georgetown, with its fine collection of Impressionist works,  became a headquarters of sorts for the party in exile. Contributors paid thousands of dollars to be invited to Mrs. Harriman's receptions and dinners, where they were given briefings and allowed to rub shoulders with party nabobs like Clark Clifford and Robert Strauss and any number of Presidential candidates and senators, current and past.         When Harriman's health deteriorated, his wife worked assiduously to keep him occupied, making sure he had visitors to keep him company when she was away. By then Mrs. Harriman had her own airplane, so she was able to return to him in the evenings. He died in 1986 at the age of 94.         A $100 Million Fortune, And a Family Feud         There were two funeral services, one in New York and one in Washington, and two burials. Mourners thought they were witnessing his burial in the family plot next to his previous wife, Marie. In fact, The Washington Post later reported, Mrs. Harriman had postponed the actual interment for two months while another burial plot was prepared at his estate in Arden, N.Y. Pamela Harriman will be buried at his side, after a funeral service in Washington next Thursday and a memorial service in Paris.         In addition to her son, Mrs. Harriman is survived by her sisters, Sheila Moore of Atlanta and Ireland, and Jaquetta James of the Isle of Mull, Scotland; her brother, Edward, Lord Digby, of Minterne Magna; four grandchildren and three great grandchildren.         Harriman left his widow most of his fortune, more than $100 million, and designated her an executor and trustee of his estate and their charitable trusts. His daughters and their children were to share in the remains of a trust after Pamela Harriman's death. The financial arrangement set the stage for another family feud.         At about the time of their marriage, Harriman put his investments in the hands of William Rich, a man he believed to be a careful and conservative investor, and he engaged his old friend Clark Clifford and his partner Paul Warnke as his lawyers.         He told his wife to follow their advice, but Mr. Clifford soon became preoccupied with defending himself against charges growing out of allegations that he was involved in the huge B.C.C.I. bank and money-laundering scandal, and Mr. Warnke moved to another law firm. Mr. Rich proceeded to make what the Harriman heirs have charged were highly speculative and unwise investments that resulted in huge losses.         The heirs turned to her to make good on those losses. In 1994 they sued her in Federal court in Manhattan. Family members suggested she had pushed Mr. Rich into making risky investments to maintain her expensive habits. She denied it.         ''I never got involved in finances,'' she said. ''It is totally absurd to think that I had any influence, or tried to have any influence, on the running of the office or the management of the money. Never. There was no reason.''         Mrs. Harriman sold some property as well as a Picasso, a Matisse and a Renoir during that time. The two sides reached a settlement in 1995, agreeing not to divulge the terms, then joined forces to file a civil suit against Mr. Rich in Virginia.         Clinton's Her Candidate And Is Duly Grateful         In 1988 Mrs. Harriman's choice for President was Al Gore, not Michael Dukakis. For the 1992 election she considered a number of candidates before settling on Bill Clinton. She committed herself wholeheartedly to raising money for his campaign and he showed his gratitude by choosing her house for his first triumphal victory dinner in Washington. Later he named her Ambassador to France.         That was how Mrs. Harriman came to preside over the palatial residence of American ambassadors on the Rue du Faubourg-St.-Honore, not far on a Paris street map but a world away from the Avenue de New York and the apartment she occupied in the 1950's as Pamela Churchill.         That she was a woman with a past enhanced her standing with the French. Her energy went into 16-hour days dealing with questions of international trade, NATO expansion and the war in Bosnia, and working the telephone to Washinton late into the night, trying to forestall cuts in the Foreign Service budget. She loved every minute of it.         Remembering Mrs. Harriman yesterday, Secretary of State Madeleine K. Albright called her a ''central figure in the history of this century.''         ''America has lost a remarkable representative, the State Department has lost one of its most effective diplomats and I have lost a friend,'' she said.         That Sunday morning in late 1996, as she sat in the living room of her private apartment in the Embassy residence, Mrs. Harriman was asked if there was anything she wished she had done differently.         ''No,'' she said.         ''Really, no regrets?''         ''I consider I have had a very fortunate life.''         ''A happy life?''         ''Very, very. I drank deep of the well.''       
         Margaret Halsey, author of the 1938 best seller ''With Malice Toward Some,'' which poked fun at English customs and mores, died on Tuesday at the Nathan Miller Nursing Home in White Plains. She was 86.         In her time, Ms. Halsey, a witty writer with an acute social concern, was compared to Dorothy Parker and H. L. Mencken. She came of age in an era when often the best job a well-educated graduate of a women's college could get was a secretarial position in publishing.         She was born in Yonkers, the daughter of Reinhold Halsey, deputy superintendent of buildings for New York City public schools. She attended Skidmore College.         In 1933, she became secretary to  the author and editor Max Eastman, who got her an entry-level job at Simon & Schuster in Manhattan.         In 1935, she married Henry Simon, an assistant professor of education at Teachers College at Columbia University and the brother of the publisher Richard L. Simon.         The newlyweds went to live in Devon, England, where Mr. Simon was on a teaching exchange. Ms. Halsey's letters home complaining of the eccentricities of English people, their food and the drudgery of their life, caught the attention of her brother-in-law, who commissioned her to write what became ''With Malice Toward Some.''         It included digressions on such subjects as English pie crust: ''It is possible to eat English pie crust, whatever you may think at first. The English eat it, and when they stand up and walk away, they are hardly bent over at all.'' On the subject of English shoes, Ms. Halsey wrote: ''Englishwomen's shoes look as if they had been made by someone who had often heard shoes described but had never seen any.'' The book sold 600,000 copies.         In 1944 Ms. Halsey was divorced from Mr. Simon. That year, she published ''Some of My Best Friends Are Soldiers,'' which she called ''a sort of novel'' about race relations in America. The book, an account of her work at the Stage Door Canteen in Times Square, was the beginning of a lifelong preoccupation with the subject of race.         ''Color Blind: A White Woman Looks at the Negro,'' followed in 1946. In the book, Ms. Halsey wrote that a need for a cheap labor supply and a fear of blacks' sexuality were at the heart of racism. Margaret Mead called the book ''straightforward, courageous and delightful.'' It was banned from schools in Georgia.         In ''The Pseudo-Ethic: A Speculation on American Politics and Morals'' in the late 60's, Ms. Halsey turned her attentions to a defense of Alger Hiss.         During the 1950's and 60's, her life took a darker course, and she wrote about her problems in ''No Laughing Matter: The Autobiography of a WASP'' (1977). She struggled with alcoholism and agoraphobia. Her only child, Deborah, nearly died from a brain tumor, and she was estranged from her parents. In 1969, her second marriage, to Milton R. Stern, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Deborah Halsey Stern, of White Plains.       
         Lucy Kroll, a longtime New York talent agent whose clients ranged  from Carl Sandburg to James Earl Jones to Norman Mailer, died on Friday at her home in Glendale, Mass. She was 87 and had moved to the Berkshires eight years ago.         She sold her Lucy Kroll Agency in late 1994 to Barbara Hogenson, an associate, but had kept a residence and office on the Upper West Side of Manhattan until last spring.         In 1994 she also gave the Library of Congress 110 boxes brimming with thousands of letters, manuscripts, contracts and other memorabilia.         The list of American greats and near-greats whose paths she crossed also included Lillian Gish, Ben Hecht, William Schuman, Martha Graham, Carl Sagan, Ossie Davis and Elisabeth Kubler-Ross. They ranged, she said, ''from dancers to jugglers,'' and many of them became her friends.         She represented Sandburg for 10 years until his death in 1967 and then tended to the Sandburg Trust for television, film and the stage. She was co-producer of a two-hour special for the Public Broadcasting System on his 100th anniversary in 1978 and organized a tour of ''The World of Carl Sandburg,'' a theatrical presentation of his writings adapted by Norman Corwin and starring Bette Davis and Gary Merrill.         She was also associated with the television version of the program, produced by her former husband, Nathan Kroll, and starring two of her clients, Fritz Weaver and Uta Hagen. In addition she was involved with a six-part mini-series of Sandburg's ''Lincoln,'' and with the award-winning PBS film ''Carl Sandburg -- Echoes and Silences,'' as well as the book ''Carl Sandburg: A Biography'' by Penelope Niven, another client.         She represented James Earl Jones for more than 40 years and looked after the interests of Alex Haley for the television series ''Roots,'' in which Mr. Jones played the part of Mr. Haley.         She also represented the playwright Horton Foote for half a century and helped establish a number of regional theaters.         During an association with the choreographer Martha Graham, she discovered that Ms. Graham had squirreled away some 50 stenographer's books of notes without ever writing an autobiography. She persuaded Ms. Graham to cooperate in their publication in the form of ''The Notebooks of Martha Graham.''         She was born Lucy Rosengardt in Brooklyn and graduated from Hunter College in 1933. She earned a master's degree in 1935 at the School for Stage while training for the classical ballet.         After her marriage to Mr. Kroll in 1939, she worked as a story analyst at the Warner Brothers studio in Burbank, Calif. She was a founder of the Hollywood Theater Alliance and the Hollywood Music Alliance.         In 1945 she returned East to open a New York office for the Sam Jaffe Agency of California. She found that the work as a literary and talent agent suited her so well that she took over the business in 1947 and turned it into the Lucy Kroll Agency.         Her marriage to Mr. Kroll, a producer-director and a resident of Tarrytown, ended in divorce in 1974. She is survived by a son, Stephen R., of Adamant, Vt.       
         Lael Tucker Wertenbaker, a journalist and author best known for ''Death of a Man,'' her harrowing book about her husband's death, died  on Monday at her home in Keene, N.H. She was 87.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Dr. Christian Wertenbaker.         She began her career at Time magazine in 1938 and reported from Berlin on Hitler and the Nazi party in 1940 and 1941. She recounted with pride that an official of the German propaganda ministry called her ''a dangerous woman.'' After the United States entered the war, she left Germany on one of the last trains out of Berlin. In London, she reported on the activities of exiled European Governments. In 1942, she married Charles Wertenbaker, Time's foreign editor.         The couple later reported from Paris, where they became friends with Ernest Hemingway and Irwin Shaw. Mrs. Wertenbaker left Time in the early 1950's, but the couple remained in France. It was there that Mr. Wertenbaker was told he had  colon cancer, the disease he died of in 1955.         Mrs. Wertenbaker's ''Death of a Man,'' published by Random House in 1957, was described in a review in  The New York Times as a ''high-hearted and unsparing memoir.'' In it, she reported that her last words to her husband, as she pumped painkillers into his arm while he slashed his wrists, were, ''I love you: Please die.''         She said shortly before her death that the book had had the effect she had hoped, easing some of the taboos about dying that existed in the 1950's. ''Death of a Man'' was dramatized for the stage by Garson Kanin. Retitled ''A Gift of Time,'' it opened on Broadway in 1962 with Henry Fonda and Olivia de Havilland playing the Wertenbakers.         Mrs. Wertenbaker wrote 16 other books, both fiction and nonfiction, among them ''The Eye of the Lion,'' a novel based on the life of Mata Hari, published by Little, Brown in 1964, and ''To Mend the Heart,'' a book about cardiac surgery, published by Viking in 1980. She also edited books, wrote articles for Fortune, Life and U.S. News and World Report, and television scripts for the ''20th Century'' documentary series for Walter Cronkite and CBS.         Mrs. Wertenbaker, who had lived in New York City after living in Europe, moved to New Hampshire in 1966. In 1970, she married Bramwell Fletcher, a stage, film and television actor, and they settled in Keene in 1985.         Mrs. Wertenbaker was born in Bradford, Pa., in 1909. She entered the University of Louisville at 16, but never received a formal degree. She was awarded honorary degrees by Keene State College in 1975 and Franklin Pierce College in Rindge, N.H., in 1982.         Mr. Fletcher died in 1988. In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Wertenbaker is survived by a daughter, Timberlake Wertenbaker, a playwright who lives in London, and three grandchildren.       
         Marie M. Lambert, who campaigned for Manhattan Surrogate promising to ''clean up the citadel of patronage'' but who retired from the powerful judgeship 12 years later best known as a patronage queen, died on Tuesday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan, where she practiced law.         The cause was kidney failure, said her son, Gregory L. Lambert. Her health had deteriorated after heart surgery last fall, he said.         As one of two elected judges of the Surrogate's Court in Manhattan, which Fiorello La Guardia described  as ''the most expensive undertaking establishment in the world,'' Surrogate Lambert heard disputes pertaining to wills and estates, and formalized adoptions. She directed the flow of millions of dollars a year by appointing guardians for those too young or too feeble to handle their accounts, designating lawyers to manage wills that had no assigned executor, and awarding legal fees.         From 1977, when she was elected, to 1990, when she retired at the mandatory age of 70, Surrogate Lambert, feared for her quick temper and ability to keep lawyers working in her court till the early morning hours, drew fire.         Democratic Party leaders would not endorse her in the primary campaign, saying she lacked judicial temperament and knowledge of trust and estates law. A judicial conduct commission investigated allegations that she was the most hands-on of fund-raisers for the primary, in which she sent out 300,000 pieces of literature and saturated the city with Lambert paraphernalia. The United States Attorney's office would periodically announce that it was looking at how she gave lucrative work to a cadre of lawyers.         But while shadows remained attached to her name, Surrogate Lambert, a gregarious, street-smart personal injury lawyer who was also the first woman president of the New York State Trial Lawyers Association, eluded her accusers. Despite the absence of party backing and the disdain of the city's editorial pages, she ran a raw and raucous campaign -- and won. Although investigators recommended she be censured for her unabashed fund-raising, the State Commission on Judicial Conduct declined to take action. And though two lawyers would be prosecuted for activities connected to her, she never faced any charges.         In 1990, an appellate court scolded her as it overturned legal fees she awarded to two lawyers, saying the fees were excessive and that the Surrogate had failed to disclose her friendship with them.         As Surrogate, she ruled over the dying wishes of the very rich and the very famous, a role she relished. Marilyn Monroe's estate marched before her, as did those of Lotte Lenya, Yul Brynner, Lillian Hellman and Joan Crawford. ''Relax,'' she told the actor Al Pacino, when he appeared on a matter. ''Nobody is going to bite you, not if I can help it.''         She was regarded as a judge who could compel rancorous cases to settle by sheer dint of her will. ''If she wanted that result, she would get that result -- legal niceties didn't bother her,'' George DeSipio, a former chairman of the city bar's trust and estates committee, recalled. ''She could be quite nasty if you crossed her the wrong way.''         But Mr. DeSipio, who remained on friendly terms with Surrogate Lambert, said that above all, she was passionate about her job. ''She was a happy judge,'' he said.         In her capacity as Surrogate, she used her authority to help gay partners clarify their inheritance rights. Since homosexuals were not permitted to marry, Surrogate Lambert permitted one partner to adopt the other as a means of guaranteeing inheritance benefits.         But her most infamous task was settling the war over the half-billion dollar estate of J. Seward Johnson, an heir to the Johnson & Johnson pharmaceutical fortune. For four months in 1986, Surrogate Lambert presided over the trial pitting Barbara Piasecka Johnson, his one-time maid and third wife, to whom he had left his estate, and his six children by two former wives.         According to David Margolick, a former reporter for The New York Times who chronicled the case in his book ''Undue Influence,'' Surrogate Lambert badgered and belittled Mrs. Johnson and her lawyers, provoking her to settle the case before it went to a jury.         In another case that raised eyebrows and grabbed headlines, Surrogate Lambert, an Italian immigrant who aggressively sought the support of Jewish voters by vowing not to direct funds to banks that joined in the Arab boycott of Israel, opened an investigation into the Palestine Liberation Organization. A journalist had left 10 percent of his $300,000 estate to the P.L.O. Surrogate Lambert said she could authorize payment to a terrorist group. After hearings in 1982, she ordered the money to be administered through the International Red Cross, to address Palestinian living conditions.         Giusippina Giovanna Maria Macri was born in a small town in the Calabria region of Italy in 1920. Her family settled in Brooklyn nine months later, where her father found work as a barber and her mother as a seamstress. She is survived by her sister, Gloria Diemer, and her brother, Charles Courtright.         She showed intellectual promise and ambition at an early age: Embedded in the family lore is the tale of how the young Marie, told by her grammar school that she could not be valedictorian although she had the academic credentials, hopped the subway, went to City Hall, and had an audience with an Italian compatriot, Mayor La Guardia, who immediately ordered the wrong rectified.         After graduating from Brooklyn College, she attended New York University Law School, where she graduated at the top of her class. In 1946 she married Grady Lambert, a salesman at Abercrombie & Fitch, who died in 1975.         She tried Wall Street law firms, but left because she was told to specialize in trust and estates law, which she considered ''women's work.'' Instead, she made her mark in the male-dominated world of personal injury law. Hungry and bright, she would take negligence cases that no one else would touch and turn them into winners. Her courtroom manner was disarming: She would shuffle in, legal papers spilling out of shopping bags. Juries considered her one of them.         From the outset of her legal career, she understood the importance of networking: In her later years, she would boast of her friendship with Roy Cohn, who escorted her to President Ronald Reagan's first inaugural ball.         In 1974, the New York State Trial Lawyers elected her president. ''She started her career and ended it on behalf of widows and orphans,'' said Aaron J. Broder, a personal injury lawyer.         In 1990, she reached 70, the mandatory retirement age for judges, and returned to private practice reluctantly. There is a Lambert legend  widely repeated in legal circles, which her son could not confirm but said could well be true. In an effort to extend her term on the bench, it is said, Surrogate Lambert traveled to Italy to check her village church records, to see if her birth date was perhaps incorrect.         Correction:  March 30, 1997, Sunday         An obituary in some editions yesterday about Marie M. Lambert, a Surrogate Court judge in Manhattan, omitted a word and thus misstated her position in a case involving a bequest to the Palestine Liberation Organization. She ordered hearings into the purpose of the organization because she said she could not authorize estate payments to terrorists. (The obituary is reprinted today on page 25.)

         Ella Maillart, a Swiss sportswoman, adventurer, travel writer and photographer who defied convention, hardship and international borders to explore forbidden territory and forbidding terrain, died on Thursday in her mountain chalet in Chandolin, Switzerland. She was 94.         She was the author of ''Forbidden Journey,'' an account of her 1935 trek to the closed city of Sinkiang in Chinese Turkestan.         During a life in which she was variously a French teacher in Wales, a secretary, a traveling saleswoman, an Olympic sailer, a competitive skier, a pioneer field hockey player, an actress, a sculptor's model and a movie stuntwoman, Ms. Maillart seemed most comfortable on the frontiers of social convention and  Western civilization.         The daughter of a well-to-do Geneva furrier and his athletic Danish  wife, Ms. Maillart grew up rich and restless.         An accomplished athlete who founded Switzerland's first women's field hockey club and was a member of the Swiss sailing team in the 1924 Olympics, Ms. Maillart was initially drawn to the sea.         She was a familiar figure on the Mediterranean in the 1920's and 30's and became something of a sensation in England after the commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet received an official reprimand because the entire fleet missed lights out while the Admiral entertained Ms. Maillart and three other yachtswomen.         She had to abandon a plan to sail the South Pacific with an all-female crew when her childhood sailing companion fell ill.         Instead, after a brief film career in Berlin in 1930, she went to Moscow, then walked across the Caucasus Mountains, tried to put together a women's field hockey team in Russia and rowed for a team called the Alimentation Workers' Eight.         A 1932 trip to Russian Turkestan whetted her appetite for Asian travel. An introduction to a Paris publisher by a noted yachtsman she had met on the Riviera helped her combine her wanderlust with professional purpose and led to two books, ''Turkestan Solo'' and ''Among Russian Youth: From Moscow to the Caucasus.''         In a 1993 interview with MarBy Blume in The International Herald Tribune, Ms. Maillart attributed her yearning for travel to her disgust with the horrors of World War I.         ''I wanted to leave Europe,'' she said, ''go as far as possible.''         Ms. Maillart, whose travel credo was ''Nobody can go? Then I shall go,'' was so determined to go where few Western men and virtually no women had gone before that she was willing to endure almost any hardship.         For her most famous journey, a harrowing 7-month, 3,500-mile trek from Beijing to Kashmir through  Chinese Turkestan in 1935, she set off with two pounds of marmalade, a  rifle, a bottle of Worcestershire  sauce, writing paper, a Leica camera and an unwieldy companion -- Peter Fleming, a Times of London correspondent and Ian Fleming's younger brother.         Both would have preferred to travel alone, but Ms. Maillart, knowing that foreigners were barred from the warlord-controlled territory, decided it might not be a bad idea to have a companion along in case she landed in prison.         Mr. Fleming, an acknowledged travel amateur, got the better part of the bargain: a companion who could design and make a tent, cook outdoors in freezing winds, sew and walk 14 miles without eating, and, as it happened, who was willing to wash his clothes as well as hers.         Or as he put it in his account of the journey, ''News Tartary,'' ''It was she, and not I, who did the dirty work.''         In the inevitable comparisons of their separate accounts of the journey, Mr. Fleming was considered the more elegant writer.         Ms. Maillart's book, a straightforward, workmanlike account of exactly what she saw, was written for the ages. In a thousand years, for example, her description of a child and newborn lambs on a yurt floor thick with their droppings will remain as authoritative an account of what things were like in Turkestan in 1935 as her photographs. Taken as notes, not as art, they were featured in a 1993 Paris exhibition.         Ms. Maillart, who often traveled alone -- on foot, on horseback, or by camel -- made another concession for a 1947 trek with a sick, morphine-addicted friend. She called the resulting book ''The Cruel Way: Two Women and a Ford in Afghanistan.''         Ms. Maillart, who leaves no immediate survivors, continued to travel, largely for her own amusement. But in recent years she cut back on her travels: She made her last trip to Tibet when she was 83 and had not traveled abroad since a visit to Goa three years ago.       
         Leanne Katz, who served as executive director of the National Coalition Against Censorship since its creation more than 20 years ago, died at her New York home Sunday, after a three-year battle with cancer. She was 65.         As a defender of free speech, Ms. Katz worked with teachers, librarians and authors across the country to fight the banning of books, magazines, movies and art.         Ms. Katz worked on dozens of cases each year in which principals or school boards had removed books from classrooms or libraries because they disapproved of the content. Among the authors whose works Ms. Katz defended -- sometimes repeatedly -- are Judy Blume, Maurice Sendak, Nancy Friday, V. C. Andrews, Katherine Paterson, Ken Follett, Madeleine L'Engle, Chris Durang, Dorothy Allison and Robert Cormier -- in addition to Mark Twain and Geoffrey Chaucer.         Ms. Blume, a popular children's author whose books dealing frankly with adolescent sexuality have frequently been the targets of censorship, said: ''When my books were being banned early on, in the 80's, I had nowhere to go, until I found this remarkable woman, this tiny dynamo who had such passion and energy for fighting censorship. From then on, if I had word from a teacher, a librarian, or a newspaper anywhere in the country that something was being banned, all I had to do was put this person in touch with Leanne, and I knew she would instantly respond and get them through this, let them know they were not alone. She believed in the First Amendment above all.''         Recently, Ms. Blume said, Ms. Katz had been distressed about what seemed to be an increasing tendency not just to remove controversial books from use, but to dismiss the teacher or librarian who chose them.         The coalition Ms. Katz headed was created in 1974, after the United States Supreme Court issued its ruling in Miller v. California, which broadened the reach of censorship, allowing the banning of any work that lacked ''serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.''         The coalition is an alliance of 45 religious, artistic, educational and civil liberties groups ranging from Actors' Equity to the American Library Association and the National Council of the Churches of Christ, and it began as a project of the American Civil Liberties Union, but soon became a separate entity.         The coalition acted as an advocate against proposed legislation, national or local, that would restrict free speech. Roz Udow, the coalition's director of education and public affairs, said it worked on more than a hundred individual cases a year, most of them involving efforts to ban works because their content is considered sexual, profane -- as is becoming increasingly common -- a reference to Satan.         ''There isn't a book in the library that somebody hasn't tried to censor,'' Ms. Udow said. ''There have always been a lot of cases about sexual content, and currently the major topics of concern seem to be homosexuality, witchcraft and the occult.''         Throughout the 1990's, Ms. Katz has been a central figure in the debate over whether pornography harms women. Some feminists, including Catharine MacKinnon and Andrea Dworkin, believe that pornography is inextricably connected to discrimination and violence against women, but Ms. Katz organized other leading feminists to argue that free expression about sexuality is a feminist value and that censorship has harmed women in the past by suppressing information about sexuality and birth control.         Before she began working with the censorship coalition, Ms. Katz was on the national staff of the American Civil Liberties Union, as liaison to the group's affiliates. Ms. Katz served as a consultant for Human Rights Watch, the National Council of Teachers of English and the Modern Language Association. She taught courses on free expression at Queens College of the City University of New York and the New School of Social Research, and wrote and lectured widely on freedom of expression.         She is survived by her husband, Alvin M. Katz, her sons, Joseph and Jamie, and her sister Sara Blackburn.         A memorial service will be held at a date to be announced.       
         Helene Hanff, whose wittily acerbic 20-year correspondence with a London bookseller she never met won her a passionate following after it was published as the epistolary memoir ''84, Charing Cross Road,'' died on Wednesday at the De Witt Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 80.         Up to the book's publication in 1970, Ms. Hanff was a relatively unheralded freelance writer whose work centered mainly on television screenplays and children's books. But the letters she addressed to the antiquarian bookshop Marks & Co. from 1949 to 1969, with their shared confidences and affectionate needling along with orders for Jane Austen and Izaak Walton, brought her a small if unanticipated literary celebrity.         Reviewing the book in The New York Times, Thomas Lask wrote: ''Here is a charmer: a 19th-century book in a 20th-century world. It will beguile an hour of your time and put you in tune with mankind.''         From the beginning of her correspondence, Ms. Hanff ignored the niceties of business letter writing. ''WHAT KIND OF A PEPYS' DIARY DO YOU CALL THIS?,'' she bellowed in an eccentrically capitalized letter of Oct. 15, 1951, after receiving a Marks & Co. shipment. ''this is not pepys' diary, this is some busybody editor's miserable collection of EXCERPTS from pepys' diary may he rot. i could just spit. where is jan. 12, 1668, where his wife chased him out of bed and round the bedroom with a red-hot poker?''         In his replies, Frank Doel, the shop's chief buyer and Ms. Hanff's principal correspondent, strove at first to maintain what she called his ''proper British reserve.'' But little by little, Ms. Hanff wore him down, as she did the other members of the shop's staff. They sent her recipes for Yorkshire pudding. She sent them food parcels and nylon stockings in a one-woman crusade to ameliorate Britain's postwar shortages. And Ms. Hanff often tempered her trans-Atlantic crankiness with rhapsodic soliloquies over the orders that Marks & Co. managed to get right.         ''The Newman arrived almost a week ago and I'm just beginning to recover,'' she wrote in 1950 after buying a first edition of John Henry Newman's ''Idea of a University'' (1852) for $6. ''I feel vaguely guilty about owning it. All that gleaming leather and gold stamping and beautiful type belongs in the pine-paneled library of an English country home; it wants to be read by the fire in a gentleman's leather easy chair -- not on a secondhand studio couch in a one-room hovel in a broken-down brownstone front.''         Despite her origins south of the Battery -- she was a native of Philadelphia -- Ms. Hanff was the Platonic New Yorker to her enchanted London correspondents. Her letters are a window on days spent picnicking in Central Park, rooting ardently for the Dodgers (and later the Mets) and wading into the fray of local politics (she was the first woman to serve as president of the Lenox Hill Democratic Club).         A constant undercurrent in Ms. Hanff's letters was the hand-to-mouth writing life she led, working at home in ''moth-eaten sweaters'' with an overflowing ashtray at her elbow and the gin bottle never far from reach. Despite repeated pleas from Marks & Company staff members to visit them in England (by the 1950's Frank Doel was offering her the use of his grown daughter's bedroom), Ms. Hanff's precarious finances never allowed her to make the trip until 1969, after Mr. Doel's sudden death from peritonitis.         Helene (pronounced heh-LAYNE) Hanff was born on April 15, 1916, in Philadelphia, the daughter of Arthur and Miriam Levy Hanff. She grew up in a theater-mad household (during the Depression, her father, a shirt salesman, took the family to the theater every week by slipping shirts to the box-office men in exchange for tickets), and all she ever wanted to be was a playwright.         Her career began auspiciously in 1938, when she won a fellowship from the Bureau of New Plays as a result of a nationwide competition. Soon afterward, she moved to Manhattan, where she became a protegee of Theresa Helburn, a co-producer of the Theater Guild. But although Ms. Hanff wrote 20 plays through the 1940's, none were ever produced. Her repeated attempts to succeed in New York theater are chronicled in her 1961 memoir, ''Underfoot in Show Business.''         ''I wrote great dialogue, but I couldn't invent a story to save my neck,'' she told The New York Times in 1982. In the 1950's, Ms. Hanff supported herself by writing screenplays for television programs including ''Playhouse 90,'' ''The Adventures of Ellery Queen'' and ''Hallmark Hall of Fame.''         A child of the Depression, Ms. Hanff could afford only a year of college, and throughout her life was an impassioned autodidact, educating herself by reading the great books, which she preferred to procure from London rather than dip into ''Barnes & Noble's grimy, marked-up schoolboy copies.'' One wall of her studio apartment on East 72d Street in Manhattan was filled from floor to ceiling with her Marks & Co. treasures, with their rich leather bindings and gleaming gold stamping. In front of the bookshelves hung the Marks & Co. sign, stolen for her by a devoted ''84'' reader from the shop after it closed, not long after Mr. Doel's death.         When Ms. Hanff decided to publish her correspondence with the shop as a memorial to Mr. Doel, the result brought her undreamed-of attention. ''84, Charing Cross Road'' was hugely popular in Britain, where it was adapted for the London stage by James Roose-Evans. (The play was less well-received on Broadway, where it ran in 1982 with Ellen Burstyn as Ms. Hanff and Joseph Maher as Mr. Doel.) In 1987 the book was made into a feature film starring Anne Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins.         The book's success finally gave Ms. Hanff the wherewithal to travel to England, where she visited the boarded-up bookshop and met Mr. Doel's widow, Nora, a journey documented in ''The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street'' (1973). Ms. Hanff's other books include ''Q's Legacy'' (1986), ''Apple of My Eye'' (1977) and the children's titles ''Movers and Shakers'' (1969) and ''Terrible Thomas'' (1964).         ''It's unreal to me, what the last 10 years have been like,'' Ms. Hanff said in 1982. ''The fans -- people all over the world who regard me as a friend! And in London there is a brass plaque on the wall with my name on it, to mark the spot where the bookshop once stood, because I wrote letters to it. In your own mind you're still an uneducated writer who doesn't have much talent, and yet here you are with a plaque on the wall in London! You don't even dream about things like that.''         But ''84, Charing Cross Road'' could not provide its author with the economic stability she sought throughout her life. ''The one drawback about being a writer is that you never know in any month where the rent is coming from six months from then,'' Ms. Hanff told Publishers Weekly in 1985.         In her last years she was ''broke,'' by her own account, living on royalties and Social Security and accepting a $5,000 grant from the Authors League Fund to help pay her hospital bills.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Carol Botwin, the author and social critic whose lively and exhaustive writings on sex and infidelity made her one of the leading sexologists of her generation, died yesterday at her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 68.         The cause was cancer, said Wilfred Koplowitz, her longtime companion.         With the publication of her first book, ''Sex and the Teenage Girl,'' in 1972, Ms. Botwin became a respected authority on the sexual attitudes and proclivities of young women.         She presented a broader view of the subject in subsequent books on sex and marriage and in columns she wrote for This Week and Girl Talk magazines in the 1960's and early 1970's. During the 1980's, she wrote an advice column for New Woman and Woman magazines.         Known for her no-nonsense advice and compassionate irreverence, Ms. Botwin managed to transcend gender and age in her writing. Her most popular books dealt with male and female infidelity and have been translated into more than a dozen languages.         Ms. Botwin's book ''The Love Crisis: Hit and Run Lovers, Jugglers, Sexual Stingies, Kinkies and Other Typical Men Today'' has been described as a field guide for dealing with the contemporary male and was the precursor to such 1990's best sellers as ''Men Are From Mars, Women Are From Venus.''         Ms. Botwin said the book was based on the personal pain she experienced after her first marriage ended in divorce. Despite her own failed marriage, she counseled married couples on how to achieve personal and sexual fulfillment within their marriages.         ''Her advice was never negative,'' said Barbara Lowenstein, her agent of 20 years. ''Her voice registered with all women, no matter what their age.''         Her most recent book, ''Tempted Women: The Passions, Perils and Agonies of Female Infidelity,'' published in 1994 by William Morrow, was viewed by experts on sex and sexuality as one of the most comprehensive surveys since Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey's studies in 1953. Drawing on hundreds of letters from women who sought her advice and hundreds of interviews conducted over a three-year-period, Ms. Botwin found that 40 percent of married women were going outside their marriages for emotional and physical attention that they were not receiving at home.         The book was a sequel to ''Men Who Can't Be Faithful,'' which sparked heated debate on the talk show circuit after it was reported that 60 to 75 percent of American men cheated at least once in their married lives.         The former Carol Dariff was born in the Bronx and graduated with a bachelor of arts degree from New York University, followed by graduate studies at Columbia University. She married Edward Botwin, a real estate broker. They were divorced in 1983.         At the time of her death, Ms. Botwin, who was diagnosed with cancer in October 1994, was preparing to write a book on the disease and her battle to overcome it, according to Mr. Koplowitz.         Besides Mr. Koplowitz, she is survived by a son, William, and a daughter, Alexandra, both of New York City, and a sister, Lillian Katell of Carlsbad, Calif.       
         Dorothy Frooks, who stumped for women's suffrage as a child, recruited thousands of men to World War I service as a teen-ager, and then spent most of the century as a lawyer and political gadfly, died on Sunday at Veterans Hospital in Manhattan. She was about 100 and lived in Manhattan and Peekskill, N.Y.         Among her many achievements were laying the groundwork for aid to dependent children and for small claims courts.         She served as chief yeoman in the Navy in World War I and as a judge advocate in the Army in World War II, taught school in Puerto Rico, ran a flying school, turned out columns for The New York World, wrote half a dozen books, founded The Murray Hills News, represented celebrated murder defendants, ran repeatedly for Congress, corresponded with George Bernard Shaw, feuded with Eleanor Roosevelt, hobnobbed with the King of Greece, turned down marriage proposals from Harry K. Thaw and Fiorello H. La Guardia, and so clouded the issue of her age that even her own family is not sure if she was 99 or 103.         But whether she was ''almost 17,'' in January 1918, as she put it in her her book ''Lady Lawyer,'' or 20, as a contemporaneous newspaper article reported, Miss Frooks, who received a gold medal from President Woodrow Wilson that month, was surely one of the last living Americans to have had a formal audience with Wilson in his White House office (and seen the evangelist Billy Sunday clap him on the back with such gusto that the President's top hat went flying.)         Whatever her age, by then she had a national reputation as ''the infant prodigy,'' ''the baby orator,'' and the girl who had made speeches for women's suffrage from Union Square to Hyde Park before turning her attention to military recruitment and Liberty Bonds.         The daughter of a prosperous businessman and an international society figure, Miss Frooks was born on a 400-acre Hudson Valley farm near Saugerties, N.Y., and grew up there and at the family's winter residence at the Waldorf Hotel.         As the seventh of nine highly articulate children, five of whom became lawyers, Miss Frooks recalled that she was holding her own in animated dinner table conversations on international affairs by the time she was 8 -- two years after she had decided on a legal career.         It was one of her mother's London society friends who spotted her talent for oratory and recruited her for the suffrage movement. Miss Frooks, who recalled making her first street-corner speech when she was 11, cut such a winsome figure in her little girl's bows and frills and spoke with such startling eloquence that she was always the first speaker at curbside rallies. The speakers who followed had learned they were less likely to be stoned or pelted with tomatoes when Miss Frooks led off.         She was even more impressive as an unofficial military recruiter, and after she had talked an estimated 30,000 men into signing up, primarily for the Navy, President Wilson not only presented her with a medal but recruited her for the Navy. As the highest-ranking woman in the service, Miss Frooks continued and expanded her recruitment activities and later organized a women's veterans organization.         Miss Frooks, who received a degree from the old Hamilton Law School in Chicago and then a master's from New York University, was a lawyer at 21, by her account.         By the early 1920's, at least, she was well known in New York as the first full-time lawyer for the Salvation Army. After setting up free legal clinics and discovering that poor people were often frustrated by their inability to collect small debts, she conceived the idea of a small claims court and lobbied hard until the first was signed into law by her old friend and suitor, Mayor La Guardia.         Thaw, the man who had killed the celebrated architect Stanford White 20 years earlier, hired Miss Frooks in 1926 to defend a 16-year-old girl who had killed the man who raped her when she was 12.         Miss Frooks, who eventually won a suspended sentence for her client,  became so incensed that the girl's widowed mother had been forced to neglect her children while struggling to eke out a living that she helped prod the legislature into establishing aid to dependent children.         The case also led to a ''My Day,'' column in The World, which lasted until 1932, when she was told that she was being replaced by Mrs. Roosevelt, a circumstance that may have contributed to her animosity toward the First Lady.         For all her childhood support of women's suffrage and her own legal career, Miss Frooks was no ordinary feminist. She made fiery speeches against the proposed equal rights amendment in 1975. As she had put it in 1922, ''Women should be in the home, have adorable husbands, and be the only wife.''         Miss Frooks, who was married in 1986, is survived by her husband, Jay P. Vanderbilt.       
         Ann Petry, who took a single stretch of Harlem and brought it vividly and disturbingly to life in her acclaimed 1946 novel, ''The Street,'' died on Monday at a convalescent center near her home in Old Saybrook, Conn. She was 88.         So much has been written about the hard life on the the mean streets of Harlem, it may seem surprising that the first major literary work to focus on that life would be a first novel by a woman who not only had not grown up there but whose exposure to Harlem street culture had been limited to nine months working with an experimental after-school program on West 116th Street.         But then Ann Lane Petry was a surprising woman, one of such enormous empathy and imaginative flair that she did not need to encounter many bereft latchkey children, their desperate, beleaguered mothers or the assortment of opportunistic men who preyed on them to translate her observations into literature.         Half a century after ''The Street,'' was first published by Houghton-Mifflin, Mrs. Petry's creations, Ludie Johnson and her 8-year-old son Bub, are still regarded as among the more indelible characters of black literature.         One reason, perhaps, that Harlem street life had such a powerful impact on Mrs. Petry, was that it was so far removed from her own genteel upbringing. A native of Old Saybrook, where her father, Peter Lane, had opened a pharmacy in 1902, she grew up in one of the few black families in the white resort.         Several members of her mother's family were pharmacists, too, and in time Mrs. Petry graduated from the College of Pharmacy at the University of Connecticut and went to work at her father's store.         But ever since a high school teacher who did not like her had praised her work and said she could become a writer, she had been writing stories and, as she later put it, gathering rejection slips.         Her life began to change in 1938 when she married George Petry, a Louisiana-born resident of Harlem she had met while both were visiting friends in Hartford.         The couple settled in Harlem, and Mrs. Petry held a variety of jobs, including writing advertising copy for The Amsterdam News and working as a reporter and editor of the women's pages of The People's Voice, a weekly started by Adam Clayton Powell Jr.         When The Crisis, a magazine of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, paid her $20 for one of her stories, ''On Saturday, the Sirens at Noon,'' it came to the attention of an editor at Houghton-Mifflin and led to both a $2,500 literary award and a contract for what became ''The Street.''         Mrs. Petry, who had written the book while her husband was in the service in World War II, was not quite prepared for the stir it created when it was published to both critical and popular acclaim. But ''The Street,'' which sold 1.5 million copies, gave Mrs. Petry the wherewithal to retreat back to Old Saybrook, where she and her husband settled in a 200-year-old sea captain's house and got an unlisted telephone number.         She followed ''The Street,'' with two other novels, ''Country Place,'' (1947) about about a serviceman who returns from the war to discover his wife is having an affair, and ''The Narrows,'' (1953) about an interracial affair.         Neither enjoyed the critical or commercial success of her first novel, however, and from then on Mrs. Petry, by then a mother, turned out books for children and young adults, among them two biographies, ''Tituba of Salem Village,'' and ''Harriet Tubman: Conductor on the Underground Railroad.''         She also brought out a collection of her short stories, ''Legends of the Saints,'' but after its publication in 1970, she limited her output to articles for college journals and the like.         Mrs. Petry had to endure a fresh burst of fame in 1992 when ''The Street,'' was reissued in paperback to a new round of acclaim.         She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Elisabeth, of Cromwell, Conn.       
         Sophia Wittenberg Mumford, the wife and sometime editor of the critic and historian Lewis Mumford,  died on April 22 at her home in Amenia, N.Y. She was 97.         At her death she was writing a book on her life and the work she undertook with her husband, who died in 1990.         After her marriage in 1922, Mrs. Mumford gave up a budding career as an editor of the literary periodical The Dial to help further her husband's literary and academic aspirations.         While running a household and raising two children, she served as a sounding board and occasional editor and adviser to a man who took neither advice nor editing easily.         She turned to social causes once again with the rise of Fascism in the 1930's and was active in a group that called for an early American declaration of war against the Axis powers. In 1944, the Mumfords' first-born, Geddes, was killed in action in Italy.         As Lewis Mumford grew more reclusive in old age, her tasks as an editor grew. The dedication of later editions of his autobiography, ''My Works and Days,'' read, ''To Sophia. Still the best of my Findings/The most enduring of my Keepings,'' an echo of his 1975 memoir, ''Findings and Keepings.''         Sophia Wittenberg, went to work after high school as a secretary and then became an editor at The Dial, where she met Lewis Mumford.         She remained his constant companion in his final years, when, she said, his mind was slipping but ''his essential characteristics'' remained. Studs Terkel devoted a chapter to her in his 1996 book ''Coming of Age.''         She is survived by a grandson, James Geddes Morss of Manhattan; a granddaughter, Elizabeth Mumford Morss of Kinderhook, N.Y., and a great-grandson. The Mumfords' daughter, Alison Mumford Morss, died in 1993.       
         Ethel Leah Heins, a specialist in  books for young readers, died on May 8 at Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Mass. She was 79, and lived in Newton.         The cause was complications from a fall, said Gregory Maguire, a friend.         Mrs. Heins was a former editor of The Horn Book Magazine, a leading review journal of children's literature published in Boston. In all, her association with Horn Book spanned four decades, her last review, of Sharon Creech's ''Chasing Redbird,'' appearing in the current issue.         Another recent contribution by Mrs. Heins was a retelling of Russian fables by Ivan Krylov. She worked with a Russian translator to stay close to the author's language and spirit while mindful of the American child as the intended reader. ''The Cat and the Cook and Other Fables of Krylov'' appeared in 1995.         Mrs. Heins, who was born in Manhattan and whose name was originally Ethel Yaskin, graduated from Douglass College, Rutgers University in 1938.         She undertook graduate studies at Columbia and Harvard Universities while working as a children's librarian at the New York and Boston Public Libraries from 1938 to 1962.         Until 1974, she was a librarian and specialist in instructional materials for the Lexington public schools in Massachusetts. Her association with Horn Book began years before.         Mrs. Heins's husband, Paul, an English professor, author and translator of the Brothers Grimm, was editor of Horn Book from 1967 to 1974. She succeeded her husband as editor in 1974 and retired from the post 10 years later.         Mrs. Heins was a founder of the Center for the Study of Children's Literature at Simmons College in Boston, where she also taught as an adjunct professor for 10 years.         Mrs. Heins's husband died last year. She is survived by a son, Peter S. Heins of Thousand Oaks, Calif.; a daughter, Margery E. Heins of Shelburne Falls, Mass.; a sister, Miriam Heins of Ann Arbor, Mich., and two grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Olding, longtime literary agent for J. D. Salinger and chief guardian of the reclusive author's privacy, who at the author's request once destroyed 500 letters they had written to each other, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         During a 52-year career with the Harold Ober Associates literary agency in New York, the last 17 as its president, Ms. Olding also represented Agatha Christie, Pearl S. Buck, Paul Gallico, Ngaio Marsh and numerous others.         ''She came on like the Unsinkable Molly Brown, but with class,'' said Ira Levin, who was also one of Ms. Olding's clients and who dedicated the thriller ''Sliver'' to her. ''She was always just clear-spoken, forthright, the kind of person you could never imagine going back on her word.''         Ms. Olding was born in New York to an English-born father and a Philadelphia-born mother and attended Barnard College before joining the staff of American magazine as assistant fiction editor in 1931, according to Phyllis Westberg, president of Harold Ober Associates. Ms. Olding joined the agency in 1938.         She married Edward V. McKeown in 1946, but they had no children and he died in 1951.         Ms. Olding's personal client list, like that of her agency, was drawn from ''both mass and class,'' said Roger W. Straus Jr., president of Farrar, Straus and Giroux. The list included both popular and scholarly authors.         She became best known for representing Mr. Salinger, who joined her client list in the early 40's. As Mr. Salinger, author of ''Catcher in the Rye,'' became increasingly reclusive and ceased to publish, it fell to Ms. Olding to fend off requests for interviews, turn down publishing proposals and movie deals and handle the author's mail.         In 1986, as Mr. Salinger successfully fought to prevent the publication of a biography by Ian Hamilton, Ms. Olding disclosed that she never even forwarded Mr. Salinger's fan mail and that she destroyed their personal correspondence in 1970, both at the author's request.         Mr. Hamilton later published a substantially rewritten book called ''In Search of J. D. Salinger.''         Mr. Salinger did not wish to be interviewed about Ms. Olding's death, or to issue a statement, Ms. Westberg said.         Ms. Olding was president of the agency from 1973 until a stroke in 1990 forced her to retire, Ms. Westberg said.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Esther Goldfrank, an accidental anthropologist who did pioneering research among the Pueblo Indians of the Southwest in the 1920's and churned out papers on the experience for the next half-century, died on April 23 at a nursing home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 100.         As a Barnard economics major whose sole exposure to anthropology had been an introductory course during her senior year, Miss Goldfrank, a Manhattan native whose maiden name was Schiff, would hardly seem to have had the credentials to go sashaying off to New Mexico at the age of 24 as a front-line scientific investigator.         But she had received a B in the course, and apparently had made an impression on the professor. A year after her graduation in 1918, she was holding down a stifling job on Wall Street when she got a note asking if she would like to be his secretary.         Within months, she was in the field with the man she and a generation of other young female protegees called Papa Franz and the world knew as Franz Boas, the German-born social scientist widely recognized as the father of American anthropology and the mentor of such giants as Margaret Mead and Ruth Benedict.         For all his stature, Boas was a figure of some controversy within the anthropology community.         Among other things, he played down the fledgling field's emphasis on biology and concentrated on studying the cultural variations of disparate societies, each of which, he maintained, was as valid and valuable as any other.         Although he had laid the foundations for cultural anthropology through his work with Eskimos in the 1880's and later with the Kwakiutl and other Indians of the Pacific Northwest, Boas was persuaded to turn his attention to the Southwest in the early 1920's by his patron, the redoubtable Elsie Clews Parsons, the wealthy, Barnard-trained social worker who had become a force in anthropology after becoming enchanted with the Pueblo Indians of New Mexico.         It was she who financed the Boas expeditions and paid Miss Goldfrank's salary, but Miss Goldfrank did not remain a secretary long. Almost immediately she expanded her duties to include interviewing Pueblo residents and painstakingly recording the meticulous observations of behavior that was the hallmark of the celebrated Boas methodology.         Miss Goldfrank concentrated initially on kinship, the mundane study of things like what one calls one's mother and who is considered a brother, which was the anthropological rage of the day.         She inadvertently broadened the scope of her scholarship and enriched the field of anthropology when she met a woman at a well and was invited to her home in the Cochiti Pueblo.         The woman was Carolyn Quintana, the daughter of a legendary Conchiti storyteller, and Miss Goldfrank was so enthralled with her detailed and vivid descriptions of the minutiae of Conchiti culture that she moved into the Pueblo and began taking notes.         Among the results were a stream of papers, including a 1927 monograph, ''The Social and Ceremonial Organization of Conchiti.''         Miss Goldfrank did most of her field work from 1920 to 1922, the year she married Walter S. Goldfrank, a Manhattan businessman and widower with three young sons. Except for a brief return visit to New Mexico in 1924, partly to alleviate postpartum depression after the birth of a daughter, Miss Goldfrank spent most of the next two decades as a homemaker and mother in White Plains, although an unusually prolific one who kept the typewriter clacking.         After the death of her husband in 1935, Miss Goldfrank moved back to Manhattan and made one more important field trip, this this time to Alberta, Canada, which led to other papers, including a 1945 monograph, ''Changing Configurations in the Social Organization of a Blackfoot Tribe During the Reserve Period.''         By then her 1940 marriage to Karl A. Wittfogel, a social scientist and former Communist, had altered the focus of her scholarship. Mr. Wittfogel had worked in China in developing his celebrated theory that the construction and control of irrigation canals had concentrated the power of ruling elites and spawned despotism, and Miss Goldfrank joined the staff of his short-lived China project at Columbia and applied his theories in her own continuing writings on Indians.         Miss Goldfrank published her memoirs privately in 1978. She titled the book ''Notes on an Undirected Life.''         Miss Goldfrank, whose second husband died in 1988, is survived by a daughter, Susan Lenhoff of Israel; a stepson, Thomas Goldfrank of Mamaroneck; 6 step-grandchildren, and 12 step-great-grandchildren.         Correction:  May 26, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Esther Goldfrank, an anthropologist who studied the Pueblo Indians, included an incorrect reference to the publication of her memoirs, ''Notes on an Undirected Life,'' in 1978. They were published by the Queens College Press; they were not published privately.       
         Robbie Tilley Branscum, whose books for young readers bore the stamp of her hardscrabble childhood in rural Arkansas, died on May 24 at her home in San Pablo, Calif. She was 62.         The apparent cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Deborah.         Born in Big Flat, Ark., she was reared in poverty on the patches of farmland in the surrounding hills. She never got past the seventh grade, married at 15, divorced at 25 and worked on dirt farms. But despite her lack of education, she had picked up a reading habit as a youngster. On rainy days, she would devour every library book she could lay her hands on.         Along the way she had also taken to writing. Her church received a  Southern Baptist newsletter, to which she submitted an article, ''Men Who Walked With God.'' To her amazement, she said later, it was published. That small success made her decide on writing as a career.         Ms. Branscum went on to write 20 books for children and teen-agers, the first of which, ''Me and Jim Luke,'' was published in 1971. ''The Murder of Hound Dog Bates: A Novel'' won an Edgar Allan Poe Award in 1983.         Her ''Toby, Granny and George''  received a Friends of American Writers Award in 1977, and ''Johnny May'' was listed among the ''Best of the Best 1966-1978'' by the School Library Journal.         Ms. Branscum's stories told of dirt-poor life in rural America, replete with moonshiners, corn pone humor and sentimentality, as well as the pleasures of berry picking, frying chicken and baking bread. Her pen also testified to the wit needed by farmers in their endless battle for survival.         She published her last two books in 1991, ''Old Blue Tilley'' and ''Never Pa's Girl.'' Over the years, she also spent considerable time speaking to library associations and telling students how she succeeded as a writer despite the handicap of having only a seventh-grade education.         Besides her daughter, of Albany, Calif., she is survived by two stepdaughters, Anna and Renae Brascum of Richmond, Calif.; three brothers, Eugene Tilley of Marshall, Ark., Ovalee Tilley of Springfield, Ore., and Hershel Tilley of Columbus, Ind.; two sisters, Bobbie Spiess of Brentwood, Calif., and Billie Jo Burch of Indianola, Iowa; two stepbrothers, Billy Ray Petty of Chester, Calif., and James Petty of Modesto, Calif., a granddaughter and two stepgrandchildren.       
         Selma Weintraub Greenberg, an expert in early childhood education who retired two years ago from Hofstra University as an emeritus professor, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was uterine cancer, her family said.         Born in Brooklyn, she graduated from the State University of New York at Oswego and received a master's degree from Queens College and an Ed.D. from Teachers College in 1966. She joined Hofstra's faculty that year. Her book ''Right From the Start'' (1978), analyzed gender issues as they relate to social justice and child development.         Dr. Greenberg is survived by her husband of 45 years, William; their daughters, Lisa Greenberg of Madison, N.J., and Ellen Greenberg of San Francisco; a son, Andrew, of Manhattan; two brothers, Walter Weintraub of Baltimore, and Robert Weintraub of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.       
         Elaine Ryan Hedges, an author, educator and expert on the contributions of American women to literature and the arts, died on June 5 at Sinai Hospital in Baltimore. She was 69 and lived in Roland Park in suburban Baltimore.         The cause was an aneurysm, according to Towson State University in Maryland, where she was professor emeritus of English and until last year directed the women's studies program, which she founded in 1972.         Her program was one of the oldest and most respected of its kind in the country. She also shared her insights abroad, by lecturing in Beijing and in two stints as a visiting professor of American studies at the Freie Universitat in Berlin.         Her writings were published in professional journals and books issued by the Feminist Press at the City University of New York, and elsewhere.         Altogether, she wrote or edited a dozen books, including ''Ripening: Selected Works, 1927-1980'' (1982), an acclaimed compilation from the oeuvre of the radical feminist writer Meridel Le Sueur.         Her edition of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's ''Yellow Wallpaper'' for Feminist Press in 1973 was considered a classic in feminist literary criticism. It also ranked among the 10 best-selling titles from university presses. Her most recent book, ''Listening to Silences'' (1994), was a collection of essays.         Elaine Ryan was born in Yonkers and graduated from Barnard College in 1948. She received a master's degree in 1950 and a doctorate in 1970 from Harvard University. Before  joining Towson in 1967, she taught at Wellesley College in Massachusetts, San Francisco State College and Goucher College in Towson.         Dr. Hedges is survived by her husband, Dr. William L. Hedges; a daughter, Marietta, and a son, James L., both of San Francisco; a sister, Dorothy Faye of Greenwich, Conn., and a granddaughter.       
         Rachel Gillett Fruchter, the Brooklyn biochemist who died in a bicycle accident on Saturday, was known for her research in gynecological cancer, as well as her commitment to women's health issues. She was 57 and lived in the Park Slope section of Brooklyn.         Dr. Fruchter was killed when a van struck her bicycle as she swerved, apparently to avoid some runners near the Kate Wollman skating rink. She was pronounced dead at Kings County Hospital Center.         She was an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the State University of New York's Health Science Center at Brooklyn. Her research focused on gynecological cancer and the epidemiology of cancer.         Her investigations were reported in numerous scientific papers and led, among other things, to changes in the characterization of AIDS in women. She maintained a tumor registry at the SUNY Health Science Center.         She also was a founder of Health Right, an independent women's organization in New York. She was a contributor to ''Our Bodies, Our Selves: A Book By and For Women'' (Simon & Schuster). Compiled and updated by the Boston Women's Health Collective, the 25th anniversary edition was published last year.         Rachel Gillett was born in London and grew up wherever her father's profession as a botanist would take him. She graduated in biochemistry from Oxford University and earned a Ph.D. in biochemistry from Rockefeller University in 1966 and a master's degree in public health from Columbia University in 1973.         She joined the obstetrics-gynecology faculty at the SUNY center the following year. Her research established that immigrant women without access to adequate health care suffer higher rates of cervical cancer. She also investigated how the human papilloma virus related to AIDS.         With her husband, Norman, she was also active in community affairs and in educational matters. One of her principal concerns was the health care provided for women from the Caribbean islands and other immigrant populations throughout central Brooklyn.         Besides her husband, Dr. Fruchter is survived by a son, Lev, also of Brooklyn; a daughter, Chenda Fruchter of San Francisco; her mother, Gertrude Gillett of London, and three brothers, Simon, who lives  in Pakistan, and Matthew and Peter, both of London.       
         Meribeth Elliott Cameron, professor emeritus of history and former acting president at Mount Holyoke College, died on Saturday at Mount Holyoke Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 92 and lived in South Hadley, Mass.         A scholar of modern Chinese history, Dr. Cameron was on the Mount Holyoke faculty for 22 years and retired in 1970. She was acting president of the women's liberal arts college in 1954, 1966 and 1968-69.         She was born in Ingersoll, Ontario, and graduated from Stanford University, where she also earned a master's degree and a doctorate. She joined the Mount Holyoke faculty in 1948.         She was the author of ''The Reform Movement in China, 1898-1912,''  published in 1932 and reissued in 1963 and 1970. She also was a founding editor and book review editor of the Far Eastern Quarterly, later renamed the Journal for Asian Studies.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Madelon DeVoe Talley, an investment manager who was one of Wall Street's first female executives, died Friday in a car accident near Wyndam, N.Y., her husband, Truman M. Talley, said. She was 65.         Despite a longtime interest in finance, Mrs. Talley did not begin her career until 1969, when she was in her late 30's and in the midst of raising three children.         In his book ''The Go-Go Years,'' an account of Wall Street during the 1960's, the author John Brooks said Mrs. Talley was a ''New York housewife who had tired of full-time housewifery,'' when she took a job as an assistant analyst at the Dreyfus Corporation.         A year later, she was named co-manager of the Dreyfus Leverage Fund, a promotion that made her the first female fund manager on Wall Street.         During her tenure at Dreyfus, which lasted until 1977, Mrs. Talley managed several funds, was a member of the firm's executive committee and earned a reputation as one of the sharper financial minds around.         During that period she also received a B.A. from Sarah Lawrence College.         ''She had a lot of energy, talent and ability in the field, and did very well,'' said Howard Stein, the retired chairman of Dreyfus.         Mrs. Talley left Dreyfus to develop programs for the American Women's Economic Development Corporation, a joint venture of the Small Business Administration and the Commerce Department that aids women entrepreneurs.         Mrs. Talley said she took the job to hone her interest in small business rather than further an interest in business.         ''Everybody in my family has started his own business,'' she said in a 1979 interview.         ''My father-in-law started a paperback book company; my father started two businesses on Wall Street, and my grandfather started two businesses in Hoboken.''         The call of the investment world was strong, however, and seven months after taking on her new position Mrs. Talley returned to it.         In February 1979 she was appointed New York State's director of the division of investments and cash management, a job that included the management of the state's $16 billion common retirement fund.         ''Madelon Talley set the procedures and processes for the retirement funds, so that when the markets started to rise in 1982, when the Dow Jones industrial average was at 800, we were set,'' said Edward V. Regan, the former New York State Controller who hired her. ''It was a very, very major contribution.''         Mrs. Talley kept her Albany job until June 1982, when she left to join Rothschild Inc. as president of its asset management unit. She held the post for two years, leaving to set up a hedge investment fund for private investors.         In the last decade, Mrs. Talley devoted much of her time to writing about investing and serving on various boards.         From 1993 to 1995, she served as a governor of the National Association of Securities Dealers. In 1995, she was appointed a commissioner of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. She wrote two books and numerous articles for a variety of publications.         At the time of her death, Mrs. Talley was vice chairman of W. P. Carey & Company, a real estate concern, a member of Alliance Capital Management's International Advisory Committee and a member of the board of the Joffrey Ballet.         ''She knew our business as a customer and a vendor, and she did a great job for New York State by getting the state heavily into stocks in the early 1980's, which was the right thing to do,'' said Dave Williams, chairman of Alliance Capital.         A lifelong resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Talley was a 10th-generation New Yorker, her forebears having emigrated from Alsace-Lorraine in the mid-17th century.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Talley is survived by a son, MacDonald W. Talley of Pacific Grove, Calif.; two daughters, Melanie Talley Whately and Marina Talley, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Raymond F. DeVoe Jr. of Sea Girt, N.J.       
         Mattie Lou O'Kelley, who began painting as a hobby at the age of 60 and became a celebrated folk artist of rural Southern life, died on Saturday at her home in Decatur, Ga. She was 89.         In her art, she pictured nostalgic views of the Georgia countryside she knew in her childhood in the early part of the 20th century: barns, farmers, animals and gardens filled with flowers and vegetables. The titles of Miss O'Kelley's paintings reflect her spirit as well as their subject matter: ''Papa Feeding the Stock at 4 A.M.,'' ''Bringing in the Night Water'' and a self-portrait, ''Mattie in the Morning Glories.'' Her work is in various museum collections, including the American Museum of Folk Art and the High Museum of Art in Atlanta.         Robert Bishop, an art dealer and collector and later the director of the American Museum of Folk Art (in Manhattan), is credited with discovering Miss O'Kelley, a story he recounted in 1989 in the introduction to the book ''Mattie Lou O'Kelley: Folk Artist. By Mattie Herself.'' In 1975, he was in Atlanta to lecture about quilts at the High Museum, and Gudmund Vigtel, the director of the museum, told him about a ''painting lady'' from Maysville, Ga., who had traveled to Atlanta by bus to show him her pictures. Mr. Vigtel had purchased one for the museum. It was, said Mr. Bishop, ''a rich, bountiful still life with a basket of lettuce and vegetables and fruit on a vibrant aqua-and-white-checkered tablecloth.'' Several other O'Kelley pictures were on sale in the museum's gift shop.         Mr. Bishop was astonished. Here was, he said, ''a true American primitive -- self-taught, an exquisite recorder of time and place.'' And ''most compelling of all,'' he added, an artist with ''a unique vision.'' He immediately canceled his flight back to Detroit, where he was director of publications at the Henry Ford Museum, and drove 50 miles to find the artist, tracking her down in her one-room cabin in sleepy Maysville. They became friends and he brought her work to the attention of museums and other collectors.         She was born in Maysville, in northeast Georgia, as the seventh of eight children, and grew up on a corn and cotton farm. For financial reasons, she was forced to end her schooling in the ninth grade and spent the remainder of her childhood on the family farm. When her father died in 1943, she moved to the town, where she worked as a seamstress, cook and waitress. After she retired in 1968 at 60, she began to paint. ''I had always wanted to paint,'' she said. ''Now I had the time.''         In 1976, she was honored with a Governor's Award in the Arts for the state of Georgia. As her fame spread, she was written about in newspapers and national magazines and television cameras arrived on her doorstep. When Mr. Bishop became head of the Museum of American Folk Art, he suggested that Miss O'Kelley move to New York. Briefly she lived in Manhattan and painted urban landscapes. Mr. Bishop said that the crowds and the cold winter made New York ''a place from which to escape.'' Eventually, she decided to return to the South, moving first to Florida and then in 1983 back to Georgia, making her home in Decatur, where she lived the rest of her life. Mr. Bishop died in 1991. Miss O'Kelley has no survivors.         In the 1980's she published several books, ''A Winter Place,'' ''From the Hills of Georgia: An Autobiography in Paintings'' and ''Circus.'' Her art also appeared on calendars, and in 1980 she had a picture of a cat on the cover of Life magazine.         One of her principal collectors was T. Marshall Hahn, a retired executive with Georgia-Pacific. Mr. Hahn remembered Miss O'Kelley visiting him on his farm and painting in his yard. Wearing a sunbonnet, she sat at a card table, and sketched, flat on the table, gradually turning a pencil drawing into a painting.         She also wrote poetry, which was as homely as her canvases:         Now my one room house has only me,         I never roam,         No lessons have I. But I paint         And paint         And stay at home.       
         Frances Keene, a writer, translator and educator who specialized in the Romance languages, died on June 26 at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. She was 83 and lived in East Hampton, N.Y.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her son Adriano Valentino.         Ms. Keene's translations from the Italian included works by Cesare Pavese and Luigi Pirandello. She also edited an anthology of writings by anti-Fascist Italians and exiles, ''Neither Liberty Nor Bread'' (1940).         As an editor at Ridge Press, Ms. Keene helped develop children's books for other companies. These included the Double-Language Books for Doubleday, Fast Books and Look-and-Do Activity Books for Rand McNally and paperbacks for the Scholastic Book Series. She was also the editor of the juvenile books program for Macmillan and worked with such authors as Maurice Sendak and Hilary Knight.         She wrote a number of books for young readers, using the pen name Alex Rider, and reviewed books for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation and other publications.         Ms. Keene was born in Boston and was a graduate of Smith College. She received a master's degree in Italian literature from Columbia University. During World War II, she worked with the Office of War Information. In later years she was a consultant for Unesco's multilingual books and was a founder of the Society of Children's Book Writers.         Her three marriages ended in divorce. In addition to her son Adriano, of East Hampton, she is survived by two other sons, Alexander Ratensky of Tampa, Fla., and Luca Valentino of New York City; a daughter, Dr. Antonia Meltzoff of La Jolla, Calif., and a grandchild.       
         Dorothy Buffum Chandler, whose vision and fund-raising fervor helped transform modern Los Angeles and who as the wife and mother of successive publishers helped turn The Los Angeles Times into one of the nation's great newspapers, died on Sunday at a rest home in Hollywood. She was 96.         Mrs. Chandler's greatest single achievement was probably her nine-year drive in the late 1950's and early 60's to finance and build the Music Center of Los Angeles County, which revitalized the city's downtown district and fused old-line society with the newer wealth of Hollywood.         The opening of the center in 1964 earned her a spot on the cover of Time magazine and an accompanying article that declared her effort to get it built as ''the most impressive display of virtuoso money-raising and civic citizenship in the history of U.S. womanhood.''         The next year, the center's largest auditorium, which has become a frequent home to the Academy Awards ceremonies, was named the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion.         Gov. Pete Wilson of California called Mrs. Chandler ''the heart and soul of Southern California's cultural life.'' Mayor Richard Riordan of Los Angeles told The Los Angeles Times that ''her imprint will be part of Los Angeles for many centuries to come,'' particularly its cultural life.         Dorothy Buffum was born in Lafayette, Ill., and moved with her family to Long Beach, Calif., when she was a toddler. Her father and uncle opened a dry-goods store in Long Beach that eventually grew into the chain of Buffum's department stores, a fixture of Southern California until the 1980's.         She met Norman Chandler, the son of Harry Chandler, publisher of The Los Angeles Times, at a dance at Stanford University, and they married in 1922.         During the years that Norman Chandler trained to be publisher and worked his way through the newspaper's executive echelons, Mrs. Chandler raised their daughter, Camilla, and son, Otis, and did volunteer work for the Children's Hospital of Los Angeles and other institutions.         When Harry Chandler died in 1944, Norman Chandler took over as publisher, and four years later his wife was named his administrative assistant. Her presence was quickly felt within the newspaper, particularly in the coverage of women and the arts. She was instrumental in inaugurating the paper's Women of the Year awards, which were given to more than 200 women between 1950 and 1976.         ''She was just really a ball of fire with whatever she set her mind to, whatever she wanted to get done,'' said James Bellows, a former editor of The New York Herald-Tribune and The Washington Star who was associate editor of The Los Angeles Times in the late 1960's and early 70's. ''She really worked at the role of women in the city, and was very involved in setting up the Women of the Year. She was very concerned that it reflect the diversity of the city and that it be given to women for their achievements and not just for social activities.''         Mr. Bellows said he found Mrs. Chandler to be ''tough, but not intractable,'' someone who knew her mind, was willing to debate and listen to argument and who eventually ''usually got her way.''         Mrs. Chandler's role as a civic fund-raiser began in earnest in 1950, when she undertook a successful drive to save the Hollywood Bowl. A few years later she began her effort to build the Music Center, eventually raising $19 million and forming a committee to float an additional $13.7 million in bonds that were guaranteed by the county.         ''She was a critical figure in the modernization of Los Angeles,'' said David Halberstam, whose book, ''The Powers That Be,'' chronicled the newspaper's rise under Mrs. Chandler's husband and son. ''If you're charting the coming of a big, sleepy, conservative community into the modern, affluent, increasingly sophisticated metropolis that exists today, she may be the single most important player.''         At the time, Mr. Halberstam said, Los Angeles was split between an older establishment centered in the downtown area and a newer establishment in Hollywood and farther to the west.         ''Culturally, she helped connect West Los Angeles with downtown Los Angeles, two communities that 40 years ago had almost nothing in common and barely spoke the same language,'' he said. ''It was her drive, energy, ambition and even hubris that connected them.''         Otis Chandler succeeded his father as the paper's publisher in 1960 and held that post for 20 years, though Norman Chandler remained an executive with the company until his death in 1974. Mrs. Chandler strongly supported her son's efforts to improve the quality of the newspaper and to raise it to the ranks of the nation's finest. Otis Chandler is now a board member of the Times Mirror Corporation, which owns the newspaper.         In later years, Mrs. Chandler served on numerous boards and Presidential commissions, devoting special attention to the University of California. She was among three women chosen by President Lyndon B. Johnson to visit South Vietnam in 1967 to assess the status of the American war effort. In 1985, President Ronald Reagan included her in the first group of winners of the National Medal of Arts.         She is survived by her son; her daughter, Camilla Chandler Frost, eight grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.         Anecdotes about Mrs. Chandler's fund-raising prowess are numerous.         One friend recalled how she tore up a $20,000 check from a wealthy businessman and handed it back to him, telling him that it was unacceptably paltry. At a private dinner where she was a guest, just weeks before the Music Center was to open, Mrs. Chandler is said to have stood up after coffee was served and gone from person to person collecting money in a large, blue bag.         ''I think of myself as a catalyst,'' she said in an interview shortly after the Music Center opened. ''There are so many people with good ideas and good intentions. They doubtless know more about the arts than I do. But I pull them together. That's my job.''       
         Jeanne Calment, born a year before Alexander Graham Bell patented his telephone and 14 years before Alexandre Gustave Eiffel built his tower, died today in a nursing home in Arles. At 122, she was the oldest person whose age had been verified by official documents.         Jean-Marie Robine, a public health researcher who is one of the authors of a book about Mrs. Calment, said she had been in good health, though almost blind and deaf, as recently as a month ago.         The French, who celebrated her as the doyenne of humanity, had their own theories about why she lived so long, noting that she used to eat more than two pounds of chocolate a week and treat her skin with olive oil, rode a bicycle until she was 100, and only quit smoking five years ago.         Longevity ran in the family; Mrs. Calment's mother lived until she was 86 and her father until he was 93. But Mr. Robine said her great strength was her unflappability.         ''I think she was someone who, constitutionally and biologically speaking, was immune to stress,'' he said in a telephone interview. ''She once said, 'If you can't do anything about it, don't worry about it.' ''         Jeanne Louise Calment's claim to fame is the Feb. 21, 1875, listing in the birth register in Arles, the southern French city where she began her days and ended them.         She was 12 or 13 when she saw Vincent Van Gogh in Arles, and she said later that he was ''very ugly, ungracious, impolite, sick -- I forgive him, they called him loco.''         She married a cousin, Fernand Nicolas Calment, in 1896. As the prosperous owner of a store in Arles, he was able to support her in style, and she never had to work. She played tennis, took up roller skating, bicycling and swimming and took great pleasure in joining the hunting parties he organized. She also studied the piano and enjoyed the opera.         Her husband, 46 when World War I broke out, was too old for military service. His business survived the Depression, but a dessert of spoiled preserved cherries killed him, but not his wife, in 1942.         They had one child, a daughter, Yvonne, whose marriage to Joseph Billot produced a single child, Frederic Billot, in 1926. Eight years later, Yvonne died of pneumonia, and Mrs. Calment raised her grandson in the family home. He became a medical doctor and died before her, in an automobile accident in 1960.         Mrs. Calment rode a bicycle until she was 100 and walked all over Arles to thank those who congratulated her on her birthday that year.         At age 110 her increasing frailty forced her to move into a nursing home. ''She complained about the food in the nursing home, which was sort of like baby food,'' Mr. Robine said today. ''She said it always tasted the same.''         At the age of 115, she fell and fractured two bones, and her memory began to fail. But she retained a tart wit. ''When you're 117, you see if you remember everything!'' she rebuked an interviewer five years ago. When somebody took leave by telling her, ''Until next year, perhaps,'' she retorted: ''I don't see why not! You don't look so bad to me.''         By the time she turned 122, she was so hard of hearing that it was difficult to communicate with her.         The name of the person who has taken Mrs. Calment's place as oldest living human was a topic of considerable international confusion today. Philip Littlemore of the Guinness Book of World Records in London said the oldest known person whose date of birth was as well documented as Mrs. Calment's was Lucy Askew, a British woman who turned 104 last Sept. 8. But several others may also have claim to the title, including at least one in the United States.         Mrs. Calment left no heirs. She also outlived Andre-Francois Raffray, a lawyer who 32 years ago, when she was merely 90, bought the apartment she used to live in on a contingency contract. He would pay her 2,500 francs (now about $400) a month until she died, and then the apartment would become his.         Mr. Raffray died a year ago at 77, after paying Mrs. Calment more than $180,000, better than double the apartment's market value. His family was still paying when she died.         ''In life, one sometimes makes bad deals,'' Mrs. Calment said.         Mr. Raffray's widow, Huguette, told French radio tonight: ''She was a personality. My husband had very good relations with Mrs. Calment.''         Michel Vauzelle, the Mayor of Arles, said: ''She was Jeanne the Arlesienne, one whose picture went around the world. But above all, she was the living memory of our city.''         She may be most famous in France for her many bons mots. One of them was: ''I've never had but one wrinkle, and I'm sitting on it.''       
         Janet Good, a longtime civil rights worker who cooperated with Dr. Jack Kevorkian to help terminally ill people die, ended her own life yesterday in her home in suburban Detroit. She was 73.         Mrs. Good had suffered from pancreatic cancer and said she hoped not to die as her mother had, slowly and in great pain. As it was, Mrs. Good confounded her doctors, who had expected her illness to take her life by early 1996.         ''My time, obviously, is not quite here,'' she said in an interview late last year. Yesterday, she decided it was, said a person familiar with her decision and who spoke on the condition of anonymity.         At a news conference in Southfield, Mich., Dr. Kevorkian's lawyer, Geoffrey Fieger, asked the authorities not to pry into the circumstances of Mrs. Good's death.         And while Mr. Fieger declined to confirm that Dr. Kevorkian was present when she died, he said, ''Janet Good is no more the victim of a homicide than anyone else who has died in association and in the presence of Dr. Kevorkian.''         In recent years, Dr. Kevorkian has become well known for assisting in dozens of suicides. He has been tried but acquitted several times, and Mrs. Good became his top assistant, helping him screen those seeking help to die and consoling their survivors.         She said she was proud to have been indicted in late 1996 on charges of assisting in a suicide. ''I was almost offended when I wasn't charged last time,'' she said. The indictment was later dropped because of her deteriorating health.         Dr. Kevorkian's name was hardly known in 1989, when Mrs. Good started the right to die movement in Michigan by founding a chapter of the Hemlock Society in her living room. The chapter now has several hundred members.         In June 1990, Dr. Kevorkian asked her if he could use her house for the very first assisted suicide.         Although she agreed at first, she later declined after conferring with her husband, Ray, a retired Detroit police commander who thought the deed might be illegal.         ''The doctor called me every name in the book,'' Mrs. Good recalled later.         But they mended their differences, and in May 1996, after her husband had changed his mind, she allowed Dr. Kevorkian to use her home to help end a life.         After her own illness was diagnosed, she said her belief in a right to die had come naturally, in part because of her mother's suffering. ''I have worked for civil rights and women's rights and human rights for many years, and this seemed to me just another right we should have,'' she said.         A native of Detroit, Mrs. Good worked for the State of Michigan, processing unemployment claims.         In the 1970's, she led a successful drive to make sexual harassment illegal in the state, a triumph that won her election to the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         She was also honored by the Log Cabin Society, a gay Republican group, for consoling AIDS patients and their families.         Survivors include her husband of 55 years; a son, Michael, of Fort Lauderdale, Fla.; a daughter, Marjorie Helmling, and a sister, Margaret Moran, both of Detroit; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. Her oldest daughter, Donna Ungar, died in 1995.       
         Maria Rosa Henson, the first of a growing number of Philippine women to break a long silence and announce that she had been systematically raped by Japanese soldiers during World War II, has died at age 69.         Her family said she died of a heart attack last week in the small home she had built in Manila using part of a $19,000 settlement she received from a specially created Japanese fund a year ago.         Mrs. Henson, who married after the war and supported a family as a worker at a cigarette factory, embarked in her 60's on a new life as a symbolic representative of as many as 200,000 women who had been forced to work in Japanese Army brothels.         In recent years, since Mrs. Henson's announcement in 1992, the issue has drawn wide attention, and victims have banded together to protest in the Philippines and Korea.         Last year Mrs. Henson published a stark account of her ordeal titled ''Comfort Woman: Slave of Destiny'' (Philippine Center for Investigative Journalism). A film about her life is being prepared in the Philippines.  She had planned to travel to Vienna next March to speak about her experiences and to open an exhibit of autobiographical drawings.         Mrs. Henson was also the lead plaintiff in a class action suit against the Japanese Government seeking damages for forced prostitution, and shortly before she died she was interviewed by a team of lawyers visiting from Tokyo.         In an interview last November, Mrs. Henson said she had fought against her trauma by clinging to the memory of every detail of her abuse, which began when she was 15 and lasted for nine months. ''I learned to remember everything, to remember always, so that I will not go mad,'' she said.         ''I am telling my story so that they will feel humiliated,'' she said of her tormentors. ''It is true: I am an avenger of the dead.''         Since Mrs. Henson stepped forward to reveal what she had felt was a shameful secret about her past, 168 other women in the Philippines have followed her lead.         But her acceptance last year of compensation prompted controversy because it came from the Asian Women's Fund -- a private fund organized by the Japanese Government -- rather than from the Government itself.         Some local women's groups opposed this form of compensation, calling it an attempt by the Japanese Government to shirk official responsibility and to avoid opening the door to lawsuits from other war victims.         Along with her compensation from the private fund, Mrs. Henson received a letter of apology from the Japanese Government. She then became the lead plaintiff in the class-action suit.         But her strongest indictment came in her book, a blunt and graphic account, which she wrote in longhand on sheets of lined paper and which has been published in the Philippines and Japan.         ''As I was writing, I was crying,'' Mrs. Henson said in the interview.         In her account of her daily routine, she said soldiers had lined up outside a small building to wait their turns with one of a half dozen imprisoned women or teen-age girls.         ''My work began, and I lay down as one by one the soldiers raped me,'' Mrs. Henson wrote. ''Every day, anywhere from 12 to over 20 soldiers assaulted me. There were times when there were as many as 30. They came to the garrison in truckloads.         ''I lay on the bed with my knees up and my feet on the mat, as if I were giving birth. Whenever the soldiers did not feel satisfied they vented their anger on me. When the soldiers raped me, I felt like a pig. I was angry all the time.''         Mrs. Henson is survived by a son and a daughter as well as by several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Adler, who kept the staff of The New York Times informed about its own milestones and behind-the-scenes adventures and shaped the legends and lore of The Times for other journalists and students for 33 years as editor of the newspaper's in-house journal Times Talk, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         Ms. Adler, who underwent open heart surgery in March, died of heart failure, her nephew, Peter Lewis, said.         Behind every news story there is an untold -- or rarely told -- tale of the reporter's personal experience: the hazards of covering a war or a riot, the grind of the campaign trail, a correspondent's travails with foul weather, bad food, crazy hours, unworkable communications and implausible expense accounts.         From 1947, when she became the first editor of Times Talk, to 1980, when she retired after 46 years with The Times, Ms. Adler chronicled these tales, and countless more routine doings, for the newspaper's 5,000 employees in a house organ that was one of the best and most widely read periodicals on the practice of journalism.         More than a compendium of staff marriages, births, deaths and achievements, it captured the life of the newspaper from the inside, with sometimes dramatic, often hilarious accounts from reporters around the world, from editors in a raucous city room, from printers riding Linotype machines, and hard men in square paper hats down in a thundering pressroom on 43d Street in Manhattan.         Reflecting its editor's fascination with the news and with the newspaper's daily production, her journal offered Tom Wicker's account of covering the assassination of President John F. Kennedy in Dallas; A. M. Rosenthal on his expulsion from Poland for reports that won a Pulitzer Prize; Claude Sitton on civil rights clashes in the South, and Robert Lipsyte on how to report a boxing match with a screaming fan standing on your typewriter. Such accounts were all the more intriguing in an era when most reporters were anonymous figures behind their news articles.         In 1966, Ms. Adler compiled 53 Times Talk articles in ''The Working Press: Special to The New York Times,'' published by G. P. Putnam's Sons. Eliot Fremont-Smith, in a review for The Times, said the book conveyed ''a remarkably clear picture of how The Times, as an entity, works -- how the news comes in and what happens to it, in both routine and crisis situations.''         Ms. Adler also wrote ''A Day in the Life of The New York Times'' (J. B. Lippincott, 1971), a 242-page account, hour by hour, of what the newspaper's staff did to put out the issue of Feb. 28, 1969, a date chosen arbitrarily, on which there was no earth-shaking news.         Based on memos from hundreds of Times employees, her account detailed the activities of reporters around the world and across the nation, looked over the shoulders of rewritemen pounding out inserts and of editors writing headlines and laying out pages, eavesdropped on advertising salesmen and then watched the presses roll and the delivery trucks roar away.         Ruth Adler was born in Rochester  on July 10, 1910, the daughter of Ida Lichtenstein and Mortimer Adler. She attended public schools in Rochester, graduated from Smith College and attended the Sorbonne in Paris for a year before joining The Times in 1934 as a secretary to Ivan Veit, then the promotion manager. She was not a member of the Adler family that is related to the Sulzbergers who own The Times.         Ms. Adler, who never married, played golf and tennis and was an extensive traveler.         She occasionally wrote articles for The Times's Sunday magazine or travel section. In 1947, she was asked to establish an internal news publication for the staff. Arthur Hays Sulzberger, the publisher, was one of her principal fans and consultants; he gave her a small staff and complete autonomy to design, edit and produce Times Talk.         During her early tenure, Times Talk was 12 pages and appeared monthly. Later, the number of pages varied in a larger format, and it appeared 10 times a year. Its circulation went beyond The Times staff, to other journalists and to journalism schools, where many regarded it as a valuable teaching aid. Today, Times Talk has 28 pages, appears seven times a year and has a circulation of more than 8,500 current and retired employees of the newspaper.         When Ms. Adler retired in 1980, a full issue of Times Talk was devoted to her. The art critic John Canaday called her ''a living encyclopedia'' of the newspaper's recent history, and Russell Baker, the columnist, offered a tongue-in-cheek tribute to one of his favorite editors.         ''Some of the best people had worked for The Times for years before Times Talk revealed that they were actually first-rate reporters,'' he wrote. ''At a time when your material was usually reduced to chopped liver by The Times's famous editing process, the opportunity to tell the story right in Times Talk compensated for many a night when you stalked out of the office in a rage to tell it to the gin bottle.''       
         Anna Balakian, former chairman of the department of comparative literature at New York University and an internationally recognized scholar in the fields of Symbolism and Surrealism, died on Tuesday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. She was 82 and lived in Old Westbury, N.Y.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Suzanne Nalbantian Reynolds.         A dynamic woman who said she had ''never been able to draw a line between work and pleasure,'' Dr. Balakian was an early developer of the  discipline of comparative literature. Proficient in French, German, Spanish and Armenian, she was a prolific author of scholarly essays and wrote several books in her field, among them ''The Literary Origins of Surrealism'' (1947), a study of the founders of modern French poetry, and ''Surrealism: The Road to the Absolute'' (1959), an exposition of Surrealist literature and art.         With her sister, Nona Balakian, a literary critic and an editor at The New York Times Book Review, she was part of a literary circle that included the playwright William Saroyan and the diarist Anais Nin. Nona Balakian died in 1991.         Anna Balakian was also interested in the problems of education, and at her death had completed a wide-ranging critique -- still in manuscript -- of its status in the United States. In 1994 she published ''The Snowflake on the Belfry: Dogma and Disquietude in the Critical Arena,'' a consideration of contemporary literary criticism and its warring factions.         She was born in Constantinople, now Istanbul, in 1915 to Armenian parents, moved with her family to Germany as a child and later lived on the Swiss-French border before coming to the United States at the age of 11.         She spoke and wrote in recent years against what she saw as tendencies toward separatism and divisiveness in a multicultural America. A prominent theme in these articles was ''the vast international connections and kinships'' that she viewed as binding together people of different nationalities.         Dr. Balakian earned a bachelor's degree at Hunter College in 1936 and  master's and Ph.D. degrees at Columbia University in 1938 and 1943. While in graduate school, she taught French literature and language full time at Hunter College High School. Toward the end of World War II, she was appointed instructor and then assistant professor of French at Syracuse University. An accomplished violinist, she also played in the Syracuse Symphony Orchestra.         She was married in 1945 to Stepan Nalbantian, a fellow violinist and an electrical engineer, who died in 1984. Throughout her life, she retained her maiden name.         In 1953, Dr. Balakian began her career at New York University as an instructor in French, eventually moving into the field of comparative literature. As a full professor, she was chairman of the department from 1977 to 1985, when she retired as professor emerita. She was also president of the American Comparative Literature Association from 1977 to 1980 and was active in the International Comparative Literature Association.         Besides her daughter, of Old Westbury and Sagaponack, N.Y., Dr. Balakian is survived by a son, Haig Nalbantian of New York City, and a granddaughter.       
         Mother Teresa, the Roman Catholic nun who won the 1979 Nobel Peace Prize for her work among the poorest of the world's poor, died yesterday in Calcutta, India, where she had lived since her work with the destitute began five decades ago. She was 87.         Mother Teresa was hospitalized several times last year with heart, lung, kidney and other problems, and also suffered ill health in earlier years. Her physician in Rome, Vincenzo Bilotta, said she suffered cardiac arrest during the evening at her convent in Calcutta, The Associated Press reported.         As her health deteriorated over the past year, Mother Teresa stepped aside and her order, the Missionaries of Charity, chose a new leader, Sister Nirmala, in March.         Mother Teresa, an ethnic Albanian born in what is now Macedonia, was revered in India, where she worked for 68 years and became a citizen.         She also came to be honored around the world for the compassionate, effective way she set up and oversaw projects to provide care and comfort to the very poor and the very sick, orphans, lepers and the dying.         Traveling widely even in her later years, she became known to millions as a slight, brown-eyed figure -- she was only 5 feet tall -- smiling and dressed in the plain white sari with blue trim of her order.         Her work was considered by some a rebuke to widespread feelings of personal powerlessness in middle-class and wealthy societies. In 1968, Pope Paul VI praised her as an ''intrepid messenger of the love of Christ.''         The Nobel Committee said its award to her in 1979 was ''for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress in the world, which also constitute a threat to peace.'' Informed of the honor, she said simply, ''I am unworthy.''         But she came in for criticism, too. A British television documentary in 1994 contended that perceptions of her were colored by ''hyperbole and credulity.''         Mother Teresa, who had been a school administrator in a suburb of Calcutta, began working in the slums of that poverty-ridden and densely populated city in 1948. She had received what she described as a divine ''call within a call'' two years earlier while riding on a train. ''The message was quite clear,'' she recalled. ''I was to help the poor while living among them. It was an order.''         In 1950 she established the Order of the Missionaries of Charity, becoming its Superior General. She went on to organize far-flung programs for the impoverished, eventually reaching more than 90 countries.         Her chief task, as she defined it, was to provide ''free service to the poor and the unwanted, irrespective of caste, creed, nationality or race.''         In predominantly Hindu India, she made sure that the priests of her order gave last rites, the Roman Catholic sacrament for the dying, only on request, and that they dealt with the dead according to the practices of the individual's own religion. For the living, Mother Teresa set up orphanages, schools in slums and Pure Heart Homes for sick and dying homeless people.         Over the years, her work expanded. She set up mobile health clinics, centers for the malnourished, rehabilitation hospices for lepers, homes for alcoholics and drug addicts, and shelters for the homeless. Her centers in the United States included the Gift of Love Hospice for 15 men with AIDS, at 657 Washington Street, in Greenwich Village.         The number of sisters in her religious order, only 62 in 1957, grew enormously. By the time Mother Teresa won the Nobel Prize, her order had attracted 1,800 nuns and 120,000 lay workers, running more than 80 centers in India and more than 100 others in other parts of the world. The order's patients included 53,000 lepers.         By 1988, her order was operating 600 mobile health clinics where almost four million people received treatment. That year Mother Teresa visited South Africa, which was still under apartheid rule, to set up a hostel in a black township. By early 1992, experts on Catholic welfare work reported, members of her order -- 4,000 nuns and novices, 400 priests and brothers and hundreds of thousands of lay volunteers -- worked at 450 sites worldwide, including in Albania and Iraq.         Aid and Tribute, But No Pity         Mother Teresa often paid tribute to the stricken people she cared for. Speaking to a gathering at the United Nations in 1975, she recalled a woman she had found dying on a Calcutta street.         ''I knew she was dying,'' she said softly. ''After I did what I could, she took my hand, gave me a beautiful smile and thanked me. She gave me more than I gave her.''         Mother Teresa put particular emphasis on giving the deprived and the sick a sensation of dignity through personal contact. ''Ours is a humble service,'' she said in an interview in 1975. ''We try to remain right down on the ground.''         But she said pity did not help the poor. They ''don't need pity, they need love and compassion,'' she once said, adding, ''If you don't know them, you don't love them and don't serve them.''         She said some people used to advise her that her order should have fans in some rooms used by its nuns. ''I do not want them to have fans,'' she continued. ''The poor whom they are to serve have no fans. Most of the girls come from village homes where they had no fans. They should not be more comfortable here than at home.''         In addition to piety, humility and warmth, she displayed strength of will, blunt practicality and organizational talent. The Nobel Committee said it meant to honor her as much for her managerial skills as for her devotion to the poor.         Mother Teresa earned her Nobel Prize despite a political climate in India that was unfavorable to foreign missionaries. In the 1970's the Government took measures to discourage such work, and by the time she won the prize the number of missionaries in India had shrunk to only a few hundred. It had formerly been 6,000. In 1979 there were about 15 million Christians in the country, 2.4 percent of the population of 630 million.         On certain social questions, Mother Teresa adhered outspokenly to the doctrine of her church. She voiced strong opposition to contraception, abortion and divorce.         In accepting the Nobel Prize, she declared: ''To me the nations with legalized abortion are the poorest nations. The greatest destroyer of peace today is the crime against the unborn child.''         Strong Adherence To Church Doctrine         In 1995, along with Hillary Rodham Clinton, she helped dedicate a shelter in Washington for women and newborn infants. The center was meant to discourage abortions by providing quarters for children waiting to be adopted or put in foster homes.         And in February 1996, Senator Bob Dole, campaigning in Iowa for the Republican Presidential nomination, declared that Mother Teresa had called to praise him for helping pass a ban against certain types of late-term abortions.         In 1995, before a referendum in Ireland was narrowly passed to end a constitutional ban on divorce and remarriage, opponents of the law were exasperated when a hand-written letter from Mother Teresa urging a ''no'' vote was made public.         On another occasion, she contended in effect that women's place was in the home, ''allowing men to do what they are better suited to do.''         Criticism of her came from various quarters. In an interview in 1995 in Calcutta, Debasis Bhattachariya of the Indian Science and Rationalists Association declared, ''Mother Teresa is not at all any better than all the other godmen and godwomen, because she helps to place a more kindly mask on the overall exploitation in our society.''         Christopher Hitchens, a columnist for Vanity Fair and The Nation, voiced particularly strong criticism of her in a 1995 book, ''The Missionary Position: Mother Teresa in Theory and Practice'' (Verso). Mr.  Hitchens contended that she had ''furnished P.R.-type cover for all manner of cultists and shady businessmen.'' Her success, he said, ''depends on the exploitation of the simple and the humble by the cunning and the single-minded.''         The Philadelphia Inquirer's review of the book carried the headline, ''A Salvo of Cheap Shots Fired at a Contemporary Saint.''         The 1994 British television documentary that criticized Mother Teresa, titled ''Hell's Angel,'' was also written by Mr. Hitchens. Asked about the documentary, Mother Teresa said simply, ''Forgive them for they know not what they do.''         In the United States, her views were of such wide interest that ''The Simple Path,'' a book of her thoughts, experiences and beliefs compiled by Lucinda Vardey, was a best seller for 12 weeks in 1995 and 1996.         She was ''an incredible person,'' President Clinton said yesterday in Edgartown, Mass., where he was on vacation. The House of Representatives, observed a moment of silence.         Answering the Call To Become a Nun         Mother Teresa was born Agnes Bojaxhiu on either Aug. 26 or 27, 1910, to Albanian parents in Skopje, about 200 miles south of Belgrade. Studded with churches and mosques, the city is today the capital of Macedonia, but was then ruled by Ottoman Turks, before becoming part of Serbia in 1913.         Accounts have differed as to the profession of her father. An authorized biography of her that came out in Britain in 1992 said he was a building contractor. While a schoolgirl, she belonged to a Catholic lay women's group. At its meetings, letters were read from Balkan Jesuits who had gone as missionaries to Bengal, in eastern India.         At the age of 12 she first felt the desire to become a nun. At 18 she decided to do so and got in touch with the Sisters of Loreto, an Irish Catholic order with missions in Bengal. She joined the order in Rathfarnham, a suburb of Dublin, in 1928. After English lessons there, she spent a more than a year in Darjeeling, north of Calcutta, where the order ran a girls' school.         She then became a teacher, mainly of geography and also of history and catechism, at St. Mary's High School, on the grounds of the Entally Convent outside Calcutta. Many of her pupils came from poor families. In time she learned Bengali and Hindi and became the school's principal.         It was while riding on a train on Sept. 10, 1946, that she received her ''call within a call,'' she said. She left her school and learned nursing skills from other nuns. Then she began her good works among Calcutta's poor, feeling uncertainties at first but also happiness as she set about meeting peoples' needs. ''I knew where I belonged,'' she recalled, ''but I did not know how to get there.''         Before long -- in 1950 -- she won canonical recognition for her new order, the Missionaries of Charity. The religious sisters who joined took vows of chastity, obedience, poverty and service.         One day in 1952, as her longtime associate Sister Agnes recalled years later, ''she found an old woman dying in the streets.''         ''We tried to get someone to take her to a hospital,'' Sister Agnes said, ''but before we could, she died. Mother said there should be a place where people can die with dignity and know that they are wanted.''         And so Mother Teresa set about establishing a home for the dying destitute. She persuaded Calcutta's municipal authorities to give her a shabby one-story building, which happened to stand next to a complex of Hindu shrines.         In that humble structure, she succeeded in creating a place where those who died would do so with dignity. The space was cleaned. The dying were cared for with compassion. The establishment was called Nirmal Hriday, the place for the pure of heart.         Mother Teresa's undertakings continued, one after another. There was a home for abandoned children, a leper colony and an old people's home. She went on to set up welfare institutions ranging from a family clinic, to mobile leprosy clinics, to nurseries for abandoned children.         A Strong Disdain For Mere Money         Her work brought in donations from admirers. She liked to say that money was ''really no problem, we depend on divine providence,'' and she said simply that her works were underwritten by ''cash and kind.''         She recalled that when her order opened a house in New York, ''Terence Cardinal Cooke was very anxious that he should give every month a maintenance for the sisters.''         ''I didn't want to hurt him,'' she said, ''but I didn't know how to explain to him that our services are purely for the love of God and that we cannot accept maintenance. I expressed it the only way I could: 'Your Eminence, I don't think God is going to become bankrupt in New York City!' ''         One longtime source of support was Catholic Relief Services, the overseas aid agency of the United States bishops, which operates in scores of countries. Its backing came largely in donations of United States Government surplus food.         In 1971 Mother Teresa's order opened its first house in the United States, in Harlem. It was soon moved to the Bronx, where, on a visit to the United States in 1980, Mother Teresa helped open a soup kitchen and declared her thanks to the poor people of New York ''for allowing themselves to be taken care of'' by her order. In 1981, she opened a mission in Newark.         Then in 1982, when she was 72, she worked for a number of days in Beirut, Lebanon, crisscrossing the Green Line that divided Christian East Beirut from Muslim West Beirut. She rescued dozens of mentally ill children from the dangers of warfare in the Muslim part of the city.         One of her biographers, Eileen Egan, reported in a 1985 book, ''Such a Vision of the Street: Mother Teresa -- the Spirit and the Work,'' that a Red Cross official who helped her observed later: ''What stunned everyone was her energy. We didn't expect a saint to be so efficient.''         After suffering heart problems, Mother Teresa sent her resignation as head of her order to Pope John Paul II early in 1990. She said the time had come for ''younger hands.'' A new head was to be chosen that September. But when the time came she told reporters in Calcutta that God's will had kept her from stepping down. Catholic clergymen said she had been prevented from doing so when members of the order's electoral college, gathered from many countries, had been unable to agree on her successor. They re-elected her to her post.         Over the years, she received many awards and honors, including honorary degrees from universities ranging from the Catholic University of the Sacred Heart in Rome to Harvard. She was awarded the Jewel of India, the country's highest civilian award. And she was an honorary citizen of Assisi, the hill town in central Italy where Francis of Assisi was born in 1182.         In addition to all her good works, Mother Teresa found time to compose prayers, including this one:         Make us worthy, Lord,         To serve our fellow men         Throughout the world who live and die         In poverty or hunger.         Give them, through our hands         This day their daily bread,         And by our understanding love,         Give peace and joy.         But she could also be briskly prosaic. In an interview in 1994 she said: ''I work all day. That is the best way.''       
         Mary Sears, a researcher at Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution for more than 60 years and a guiding editorial force behind several top scientific publications devoted to marine studies, died on Sept. 2 at her home in Woods Hole, Mass. She was 92.         Early in Dr. Sears's career, societal conventions prevented women from going to sea on research voyages, so Dr. Sears focused her energies on editing publications devoted to oceanography. She was the founding editor of Deep-Sea Research, a journal she directed from 1953 to 1974. She was also editor of the book ''Oceanography,'' a compendium of marine science published in 1961 by the American Association for the Advancement of Science.         From 1943 to 1946, Dr. Sears was a lieutenant junior grade in the Navy, assigned to naval intelligence in Washington. While there, she organized and headed the Oceanographic Unit of the Navy Hydrographic Office, which until World War II had been mainly engaged in making and printing navigational charts. Under her guidance, the hydrographic agency evolved into the Naval Oceanographic Office.         Her duties included coordinating naval oceanographic research at Woods Hole, where, as part of the war effort, scientists studied such matters as the behavior of smoke at sea and the use of the temperature and water-density characteristics of ocean layers to help submarines avoid detection.         Mary Sears was born on July 18, 1905, in Wayland, Mass. She attended Radcliffe College in Cambridge, Mass., from which she received a bachelor's degree in 1927, a master's degree in 1929 and a doctorate in zoology in 1933. As a graduate student, she worked at Harvard University with Henry Bigelow, the founder and first director of Woods Hole.         In 1932 she began working as a planktonologist at Woods Hole, and was one of the first 10 staff research assistants at the Cape Cod institution, which was then primarily a summer operation. She was a research assistant at Harvard from 1933 to 1949, and an instructor at Wellesley College from 1938 to 1943.         Dr. Sears was the staff planktonologist at Woods Hole from 1940 to 1963, when she became a senior scientist in the biology department, a post she held until her retirement in 1970. She was named scientist emeritus in 1978.         Dr. Sears was chairwoman of the First International Congress on Oceanography, which was held at the United Nations in 1959. She was a member of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the Society of Women Geographers and the American Geophysical Union.         She is survived by two sisters, Leila Sears of North Pomfret, Vt., and Elisabeth Laderoute of Princeton, N.J., and a brother, John, of Jamaica, West Indies.       
         Connie Clausen, an actress and literary agent who began her career by riding circus elephants, died on Sept. 7 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said Stedman Mays, an associate of Ms. Clausen's literary agency.         Ms. Clausen's career began in the 1940's when she rode atop elephants for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, providing the material for her memoir, ''I Love You Honey, but the Season's Over.'' After leaving the circus, she went to work at M-G-M studios in Hollywood, rising from messenger to director of special promotions.         In New York, she landed several roles on Broadway and television before becoming a publicity agent for Macmillan publishing in the 1970's. She helped publicize two of the company's international best-sellers, ''Watership Down'' and ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull,'' and in 1973 was made an assistant vice president.         She left Macmillan in 1976 to start her own agency, Connie Clausen & Associates, which was a pioneer in the so-called beauty book, beginning with a series of best sellers by the photographer Francesco Scavullo. Other successful categories for Ms. Clausen were memoirs and biographies, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Jackson Pollock: An American Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh and Gregory Smith, and Quentin Crisp's ''Resident Alien: The New York Diaries.''         Ms. Clausen's three marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Michael Andersen of San Francisco; a brother, Harold, of Orlando, Fla., and a sister, Dolores Clausen Brockmeyer of Sarasota, Fla.       
         Katherine B. Oettinger, an authority on the care and upbringing of children, who was head of the Federal agency for the care of handicapped and underprivileged children, died on Monday in Carmel, Calif. She was 94.         Appointed by President Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1957 as chief of the Children's Bureau in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, Dr. Oettinger served four administrations. When the bureau was abolished in 1967, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her deputy assistant secretary for family planning and population. She retired from Government service in 1970 when the post was abolished in the Nixon Administration.         As an expert on retarded children, Dr. Oettinger expounded the view that such children could often be cared for in the home, and should be, though in an earlier time they were routinely sent to institutions. She was also intent on educating the nation about the difficult period of adjustment facing most parents of retarded children.         ''Some parents still blame themselves when they discover their child is retarded,'' she said, and then go from doctor to doctor looking for a ''cure,'' rather than counseling that will help them teach their children to learn to function with some degree of success.         Young parents, she said, particularly need help in evaluating whether the child can best be cared for at home, as 95 percent were by the 1960's, or in an institution. If the decision is the home, she said, careful parental training is needed in precise ways of giving consistent directions, for example, in using patterns of speech that the child can easily understand.         Dr. Oettinger received many awards and was called one of the nation's ''true heroines'' by Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey. After she left the Government, she traveled the world as a consultant on population control and family planning and wrote articles for social science journals and a well-received book, with Elizabeth C. Mooney, ''Not My Daughter: Facing Up to Adolescent Pregnancy'' (Prentice-Hall, 1979).         A native of Nyack, N.Y., she graduated from Smith College in 1925 with a degree in sociology and earned a master's degree in social work there.         Starting her career as a social worker in St. Paul, she moved to the Hell's Kitchen neighborhood in Manhattan, and then on to train nurses in the care of the handicapped in Scranton, Pa.         Her husband, Malcolm H. Oettinger, whom she married in 1930, died in 1963. She is survived by two sons, Malcolm Jr., of Chapel Hill, N.C., and John. B, of Los Angeles.         After her work in Scranton, she became director of community services in the Pennsylvania welfare department, working to improve mental health clinics and the training of welfare workers and ministers. She became the dean of the School of Social Work at Boston University in 1954.         ''You'll never get rich as a social worker,'' she told her students. ''But the satisfaction comes from helping humanity -- it's a wonderful field.''       
         Nancy Dickerson, who in the 1950's and 60's combined network television reporting with her role as a sought-after Washington partygiver and insider, died yesterday in New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and maintained homes for many years both in Washington and New York.         The cause of death was complications from a stroke she suffered in January 1996, said a son, John Dickerson. Ms. Dickerson suffered from declining health after being stricken by a heart attack, and then the stroke. She seemed to be making progress but then began to regress, said her husband, John C. Whitehead. Ms. Dickerson was given final rites of the Roman Catholic Church last Thursday.         In 1960, as Nancy Hanschman, she became the first woman to be hired as a network correspondent by CBS News and was a mainstay there and in the Washington bureau of NBC, in which she worked from 1963 to 1970. After that, she formed her own company and devoted herself to producing and appearing in syndicated television productions. One project was ''784 Days That Changed America -- From Watergate to Resignation,'' which won the Peabody Award. Another of her programs was ''Being With John F. Kennedy,'' a documentary co-produced with Robert Drew. She also served as a commentator for Fox News.         Among the stories of which she was most proud were her 1980 interviews with President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel and Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal of Saudi Arabia. The interviews were presented by the Public Broadcasting System.         She also produced for PBS a documentary on the role of women in the Arab world titled, ''Islam: The Veil and the Future.''         Ms. Dickerson often acknowledged over the years that her success came partly from knowing people.         ''My social life always seems to revolve around business,'' she said.         The people on her ''A'' list who attended her parties included Ronald and Nancy Reagan, Averell and Pamela Harriman, Walter Annenberg, Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon, Edward Bennett Williams, Joseph Califano, Elliot Richardson and other prominent figures in administrations from John F. Kennedy's to Mr. Reagan's.         She entertained them at her townhouse in Washington's Kalorama Triangle or at Merrywood in McLean, Va., the estate where Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and Princess Lee Radziwill grew up. Merrywood was acquired in 1965 by her husband then, C. Wyatt Dickerson, a real-estate investor, and it was where some of Ms. Dickerson's most lavish parties were held.         It was an indication of her place in the capital's social firmament that when she married Mr. Dickerson in 1962, a party was given in her honor, hosted by President Lyndon B. Johnson, Justice Arthur Goldberg of the Supreme Court and Senator Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut.         In her memoirs, published as ''Among Those Present'' by Random House in 1976, Ms. Dickerson revealed that in the 1950's, she had dated John F. Kennedy when he was a Senator from Massachusetts, Senator Henry Jackson of Washington, Senator Kenneth Keating of New York and had been propositioned at least once by Lyndon B. Johnson. (She turned him down, she said.) Left unfinished at the time of her death was a sequel to this book.         Ms. Dickerson used her contacts to get many scoops in Washington. One of them was Mr. Johnson's decision, in 1964, to ask Senator Hubert H. Humphrey to be his running mate. Another was a rare interview with Speaker Sam Rayburn (who did not like to be interviewed on camera) and an exclusive interview with Senator Barry Goldwater, who wanted to explain to her why he had voted against the Civil Rights Bill.         Not all her exclusives came from Washington. In 1963, she was first to learn that an airline crash near San Francisco had been caused because a deranged passenger had shot the pilot.         She was born Nancy Conners Hanschman to Frederick R. and Florence Conners Hanschman on Jan. 27, 1927, in Wauwatosa, Wisc., a suburb of Milwaukee. She attended Clark College, then a Catholic school for women in Dubuque, Iowa, then entered the University of Wisconsin, where she concentrated in English, Spanish and Portuguese, earning her bachelor's degree in 1948.         She taught school for a time in Milwaukee but in 1951, came to New York in search, she said, of an interesting job. When she could not find something suitable, she went to Washington, where she became a registrar in the Institute of Languages at Georgetown University. She soon found a more desirable job, doing research for the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.         She heard that CBS was looking for somebody to produce a radio show about the political scene in Washington called ''The Leading Question,'' and talked her way into it. She did well as a producer, although she had never done it before, and as a result was named associate producer of ''Face The Nation,'' when CBS started that successful interview program in the middle 50's. One of her coups was to persuade the Speaker of the House, Joseph Martin of Massachusetts, to make his television debut on CBS.         She wanted to be on the air herself but in those days, the national reporting staff of CBS was a male preserve. In order to break into it, she used her 1959 vacation to go to Europe to do a radio feature on the peacetime activities of the Women's Army Corps. CBS officials liked it so much, they used it on ''The World Tonight,'' then a mainstay of CBS Radio.         In 1960, CBS decided it would expand its staff to cover the Presidential elections and named her its first woman correspondent in February of that year. The other two networks, NBC and ABC, already had named women to their news staffs, but Miss Hanschman was certainly in the vanguard of women in the ranks of network correspondents. She first covered Senator Humphrey's campaign, but when he lost the West Virginia primary to Mr. Kennedy and dropped out of the primary, she covered Senator Lyndon Johnson all the way to the Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles in July of 1960, where he became Mr. Kennedy's running mate,         Later that year, CBS gave her own weekday radio show, ''One Woman's Washington,'' in which she discussed Washington topics that she thought might be of interest to women around the country. But she did not want to be involved only in women's programming and in the next few years, covered Mr. Kennedy's funeral and the civil rights movement, including the March on Washington.  In 1963, she left CBS and joined NBC News in Washington, where she remained until 1970, covering general national news and politics.         She married C. Wyatt Dickerson,  in 1962. That union ended in divorce in 1983. In 1989, she married John C. Whitehead, chairman of AEA Investors, an investment concern in New York, and chairman of the Federal Reserve Bank in New York. He is also a former senior partner and co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company, and was a Deputy Secretary of State in the Reagan Administration. She maintained a home in New York on Sutton Place and was active in various philanthropic efforts, including serving on the boards of Covenant House, the Hospital for Special Surgery, and the New York Public Library. She was also a member of the Central Park Conservancy. In Washington she was active in the White House Endowment Fund, among other causes.         Survivors in addition to her husband include three daughters, Elizabeth Earls and Jane Dickerson, both of Washington, and Ann Pullion of Villanova, Pa.; and two sons, Michael Dickerson of Atlanta, Ga., and John Dickerson of Washington, and a sister, Mary Ellen Phillip of Milwaukee.         Correction:  October 20, 1997, Monday         An obituary yesterday about Nancy Dickerson referred incorrectly to Lyndon B. Johnson, who was a host at a party for her when she was married in 1962. Johnson was Vice President, not President, at the time.       
         Esther G. Gottesman, whose service to the Jewish community spanned more than 60 years and who played an important role in the acquisition of the Dead Sea Scrolls for Israel, died yesterday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 98 and had homes in Palm Beach and Manhattan.         Mrs. Gottesman's interest and appreciation of the historical importance of the Dead Sea Scrolls led her to recommend to her brother-in-law, D. Samuel Gottesman, that he finance their acquisition and donate them to Israel. The Shrine of the Book was later established at the Israel Museum to display the scrolls.         A lifelong Zionist, she was a delegate to the first postwar congress of the World Zionist Organization in Basel, Switzerland, in 1946. She was a member of the WZO Action Committee during the formative years of the State of Israel. A supporter of Jewish education, she was active in the Board of Jewish Education in New York for many years.         A national board member of Hadassah since 1934, Mrs. Gottesman held many positions in the organization, including vice president and treasurer. As a committee chairman, she advocated the idea that the group support the expansion of a vocational educational program from a small high school to a major college, the Hadassah College of Technology in Jerusalem. She donated the college's auditorium and gymnasium and raised funds for it.         She was also responsible for developing what had been a house newsletter into Hadassah Magazine, and she assembled and arranged publication of the book, ''Great Ages and Ideas of the Jewish People.''         Mrs. Gottesman was born in Manhattan in 1898, the daughter of Aaron and Sarah Garfunkel. She graduated from New York University in 1921 and married Benjamin Gottesman, a banker and investment manager, the same year. He died in 1979.         The couple's financial support of Yeshiva University resulted in the establishment of the Mendel Gottesman Library, named after Mr. Gottesman's father, the endowment of a chair in Library Sciences and creation of the Benjamin Gottesman Presidential Lecture Series. The family's involvement with the university covered 75 years.         She is survived by two sons, David S. Gottesman of Manhattan and Milton M. Gottesman of Washington; two brothers, Harold Garfunkel of Manhattan and Julian Garfunkel of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a sister, Florence Roswell of Manhattan; three grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Merian Lovelace Kirchner, the little girl whose pleadings for just one more bedtime story gave birth to a beloved series of children's books, died on Sept. 25 at a hospital on Staten Island. She was 66 and the daughter of Maud Hart Lovelace, the creator of the Betsy-Tacy books.         Friends said the cause was emphysema.         It was her mother who lived and wrote the Betsy-Tacy life, not so much creating as copying her characters whole from her own turn-of-the-century childhood in Mankato, Minn., or Deep Valley, as it is known in the 10 main Betsy-Tacy books and three satellite volumes.         But it was little Merian Lovelace, growing up in the 1930's in Garden City, Long Island, who first demonstrated that her mother's girlhood had more than passing appeal. She pestered her mother so often for a new story about Betsy Ray and her friend Tacy Kelly that Mrs. Lovelace, who had concentrated on short stories and historical novels, decided to put Betsy and Tacy on paper.         The result has been something of a literary cult.         For although Betsy Ray and Tacy Kelly have never quite achieved the stature of, say, Nancy Drew, they have spawned a 1,000-member Betsy-Tacy society and a Betsy-Tacy home page (http://virtuflex.com/ Betsy-Tacy/), and they have turned Mankato into a tourist attraction.         Aside from the fact that Betsy was an uncommonly independent young heroine, a bustle-era girl who took her own ambitious career plans for granted, the books have exerted a special appeal because unlike Nancy Drew, who was blond, perfect and 18 forever, Betsy and her friends grew older in each successive book.         When the first book, ''Betsy-Tacy,'' covering Betsy's meeting with Tacy at age 5, was published in 1940, Mrs. Kirchner was 9. By the time she got to Smith College, she was something of a minor celebrity, letting her classmates read the proofs of the latest installment.         The last book, ''Betsy's Wedding,'' was published in 1955, a year after her marriage to Englebert Kirchner, a German-born writer.         As the daughter of a woman who turned her own childhood into literary fodder, Mrs. Kirchner might have been expected to continue the tradition.         But except for a column she wrote for the Betsy-Tacy Society newsletter, she showed little interest in her childhood and none in fiction.         Not that Mrs. Kirchner was especially rebellious. It was just that she decided to follow in the footsteps of her father, Delos Lovelace, a Minnesota-born journalist who was once city editor of the old New York Sun. (He was also the author of the novelization of the movie ''King Kong,'' which helps explain why he named his daughter after the movie's director, Merian C. Cooper.)         Settling in Greenwich Village as her parents had done a generation earlier, Mrs. Kirchner held a series of jobs in journalism, contributing to a book on civil rights for Newsfront Publishers, working as a freelance book editor, and ending her career as a senior writer for the magazine Medical Economics.         After her mother's death in 1980, Mrs. Kirchner helped keep the Betsy-Tacy flame alive, working closely with the Betsy-Tacy Society and campaigning for reissues of the books. Her husband died in 1992.         For all her role in the creation of the Betsy-Tacy series, Mrs. Kirchner never appeared as a character, except by implication.         At the end of ''Betsy's Wedding,'' as her husband, Joe, is about to go off to World War I, Betsy speaks of their plans to have a little girl named Bettina, not realizing, perhaps, that in time the little girl would make her mother write it all down.       
         Jane Warner Dick, an early social welfare advocate who later served on a United Nations panel, died on Sept. 29 at her home in Lake Forest, Ill. She was 91.         Mrs. Dick's social work began in 1926 with Hull House, founded by Jane Addams in 1889. A friend of Ms. Addams, Mrs. Dick volunteered in the Immigrants Protection League, an arm of Hull House that provided legal services and helped immigrants adjust to life in the United States.         She later served on the Illinois Social Welfare Foundation as well as the Illinois Board of Public Welfare, where she established volunteer services for the state's mentally ill.         Mrs. Dick was active in Democratic politics in Illinois, where she was an early supporter of Adlai Stevenson. She urged Mr. Stevenson to run for governor in 1948 and served as the state chairwoman of his successful gubernatorial campaign. She also worked on his Democratic Presidential campaigns in 1952 and 1956.         In 1961, Mrs. Dick was appointed as the United States representative to the Social Commission of the United Nations Economic and Social Council by President John F. Kennedy, on the recommendation of Mr. Stevenson, then Ambassador to the United Nations.         In her time with the United Nations, Mrs. Dick played a pivotal role in a raucous debate over a proposed resolution condemning racial discrimination. The United States maintained that the resolution, which called on nations to outlaw any organization that promoted discrimination, was too sweeping.         ''The United States' legal system does not permit censorship or punishment for the expression of ideas, even ideas we loathe,'' she said at the United Nations in 1963. ''We do not believe it is necessary to restrict freedom of thought in order to overcome discrimination.''         A version of the resolution was eventually adopted, with the United States and several Western nations abstaining from the vote.         Mrs. Dick was the author of a book about Mr. Stevenson, ''Volunteers and the Making of Presidents,'' published by Dodd, Mead Inc. She was a trustee of the Menninger Foundation, an advocacy group for the mentally ill; the Children's Home and Aid Society of Illinois, and the Newberry Library in Chicago. She was also a governing member of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra.         Her husband, the Chicago industrialist Edison Dick, died in 1994. She is survived by a daughter, Titia Dick Ellis of Santa Fe, N.M.; a son, Edison W., of Washington; a sister, Marion Hodgkins of Lake Forest, Ill.; 9 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Helen Wright Greuter, an astronomer and author, died on Oct. 23 at the Thomas House Retirement Home in her native Washington. She was 82.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         Ms. Wright, who used her family's name professionally, worked as an astronomer before she turned to freelance writing and editing in the 1940's. She was best known for her book, ''Explorer of the Universe: A Biography of George Ellery Hale.''         Originally published by Dutton in 1966, it was reissued three years ago by the American Institute of Physics in the History of Modern Physics and Astronomy Series. Hale was the pioneering American astronomer who founded and directed the great observatories at Mount Wilson and Mount Palomar and founded The Astrophysical Journal.         Another of Ms. Wright's books in print, in a commemorative edition from College Avenue Press, is ''Sweeper of the Sky: The Life of Maria Mitchell'' (Macmillan, 1949). It was a tribute she had wanted to pay since her student years at Vassar College to America's first female astronomer who was a feminist leader and a distinguished member of the original Vassar faculty.         Ms. Wright also chronicled the creation of Palomar in 1952, at the time the world's largest telescope. She wrote and edited many books about the history and methodology of a broad spectrum of sciences, among them mathematics, physics, anthropology and archeology.         She graduated from Vassar in 1937 and received a master's degree there two years later.         Her husband, Rene Greuter, died in the early 1970's. She is survived by two brothers, William F. Wright of Vestal, N.Y., and Kenneth A. Wright of Lexington, Mass.       
         Lillian Rogers Parks, who surprised President William Howard Taft in his bedroom in 1909 and lived to tell that and many another juicy White House tale, died on Thursday at a hospital in Washington. She was 100 and the writer of ''My Thirty Years Backstairs at the White House.''         The title of Mrs. Parks's 1961 memoirs, written with Frances Spatz Leighton, was somewhat misleading. For although Mrs. Parks worked as an observant White House seamstress and maid only from the beginning of the Hoover Administration in 1929 to the end of the Eisenhower years in 1961, she had been a familiar figure at the White House since she was a little girl.         That is because her mother, Maggie Rogers, who joined the White House staff on the fourth day of the Taft Administration, would often take her daughter to work with her. And when she did not, she would come home to regale her family with stories of what she had seen or heard at the White House that day.         Mrs. Rogers, a one-time society hairdresser who had used her client connections to get the White House job, eventually became the No. 1 White House maid and stayed on into the 1930's, dusting, cleaning -- and taking notes.         It was her insistence that her daughter complete the book she had long planned that helped induce Mrs. Parks to combine her mother's recollections with her own in what became ''Backstairs,'' and two other books written with Miss Leighton: ''It was Fun Working in the White House,'' a children's book, and ''The Roosevelts: A Family in Turmoil,'' published in 1973.         Mrs. Parks had also seen ''White House Chef,'' a book Miss Leighton had written with a former chef in the Eisenhower White House. Realizing she had far more White House anecdotes to tell, Mrs. Parks got in touch with Miss Leighton.         ''Backstairs,'' which became the basis of a nine-part NBC miniseries in 1979, created an immediate sensation when it was published in 1961. The book, which was on The New York Times best-seller list for 26 weeks, so alarmed the incoming First Lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, that she ordered all White House domestic employees to sign a pledge not to write about their White House experiences. (The task of collecting the signatures was given to Mrs. Kennedy's secretary, Mary Gallagher, who neglected to sign one, herself, and eventually wrote her own tell-all with Miss Leighton, ''My Boss,'' in 1969.)         For all the furor it created in the White House, the Parks book was comparatively tame, providing a wealth of charming and intimate gossip about the various First Families she served but no serious scandal.         By her own account, Mrs. Parks, who contracted polio when she was 6 and used a crutch the rest of her life, had a generally privileged existence in the White House, so much so that when members of the domestic staff were barred from using the White House elevator in World War II, so the crippled President, Franklin D. Roosevelt, could be evacuated quickly in an emergency, the President, himself, ordered an exception for ''Little Lillian,'' the universal nickname for a woman who never grew above 4 foot 9.         Mrs. Parks, who was divorced, leaves no immediate survivors.         Although she generally found something nice to say about every President and First Lady she or her mother worked for, Mrs. Parks, who clearly considered Bess Truman her favorite First Lady, also greatly admired Eleanor Roosevelt.         Indeed, her own White House career might have ended with the Hoover Administration had it not been for a ringing declaration of domestic independence by Mrs. Roosevelt. As recounted in ''Backstairs,'' Mrs. Roosevelt, who had long chafed at living under the thumb of her imperious mother-in-law at Hyde Park, was not cowed when the senior Mrs. Roosevelt arrived at the White House in 1933 to help get her son settled and to take charge of the household.         But when the elder Mrs. Roosevelt criticized her daughter-in-law ''for using colored help instead of white help, as was the custom at Hyde Park,'' the First Lady put her foot down.         ''Mother,'' she said, according to the maid who overheard the conversation, ''I have not told you this before, but I must tell you now. You run your house and I'll run mine.''         Although it has been almost 40 years since Mrs. Parks retired, there is reason to suspect that she may still be haunting the White House, a residence replete with ghosts.         As she described it in her book, on one of her first visits to the White House in 1909, her mother turned down the President's bed, then left her daughter in the bedroom, ordering her to stay put while she took care of some brief duties elsewhere.         While she waited, a ''very stout,'' ''jolly,'' man came into the room, took one look at the girl wearing a prim white dress and said: ''Well, what have we here? Are you the little ghost of the White House I've been hearing about?''       
         Catharine Carver, who won trans-Atlantic esteem as the editor of a galaxy of mid-20th century authors, including Hannah Arendt, John Berryman, Saul Bellow and Flannery O'Connor, died on Tuesday at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. Ms. Carver, an American who lived in London, was 76.         Friends said she died after a series of strokes.         Ms. Carver was widely known for her work at Lippincott with Leon Edel on many of the volumes of his biography of Henry James, a work she abridged at the author's request into a single volume. He acknowledged her success with thanks in his preface.         The last book to receive her professional attention, which was characterized by devotion to her authors, profound intelligence, sensitivity and scholarship and mastery of subject, as well as attention to detail and, above all, passion, was Richard Ellmann's biography ''Oscar Wilde,'' published by Knopf in 1987.         Aileen Ward, whose biography of John Keats won a National Book Award, said she was impressed that Ms. Carver had reread all of Keats's work before beginning to edit the manuscript. It was Ms. Carver who pointed out to Mr. Ellmann, who was baffled by James Joyce's use of the word trombone in a nonmusical sense while he was collecting an edition of the author's letters, that Joyce had simply appropriated a French colloquialism for paper clip.         Besides the praise she earned from individual authors, whose ranks also included E.E. Cummings, Lionel Trilling, Katherine Anne Porter, Bernard Malamud, Leslie Fiedler and Peter Matthiessen, Ms. Carver was given a citation some 20 years ago by New York P.E.N., the writers organization, for her ''creative contributions to authors and their works.''         Ms. Carver, who was born in Cambridge, Ohio, graduated in 1943 with a Bachelor of Arts degree from Muskingum College in Ohio, where she was a classmate of the future astronaut and senator, John Glenn.         She began her editing career in 1945 with Reynal & Hitchcock, became the first reader at Partisan Review and was hired in 1950 by Robert Giroux as an editor at Harcourt, Brace and Company.         Subsequently she worked for Viking, Lippincott in Philadelphia and, briefly, for The New Yorker before leaving the United States in the 1960's to settle in England. There she worked at John Murray's and Chatto & Windus before joining Oxford University Press. But when that publisher shut down its offices in London, Ms. Carver declined to move to Oxford. Remaining in London, she worked with various publishers, including Victor Gollancz, and in the 1980's joined Trianon Press in Paris before returning to London.         She is not survived by any immediate family members.       
         Marguerite Henry, the author of the children's book classic ''Misty of Chincoteague,'' one of some four dozen books that introduced young readers to animals in the great outdoors, died on Wednesday at her home in Rancho Santa Fe, near San Diego. She was 95.         While much of her work as a professional writer remains highly popular, and in print, it was the tale of ''Misty,'' first published in 1947, that captured the imagination and took on a life of its own. It told of two orphaned siblings drawn to a wild horse on Chincoteague Island, off the Virginia shore. Ms. Henry's colorful story found its way onto film, still seen on television to this day, and made a popular tourist destination of the annual roundup and auction of wild horses on Virginia's barrier islands.         The real Misty died in 1972 but a life-size statue of the horse was recently dedicated at the site of that midsummer roundup, called Pony Penning Day. Ms. Henry spun out further stories about the filly and its young friends, Paul and Mary Beebe, into the 1990's.         She also wrote of wild mustangs, thoroughbreds, Arab stallions, Lippizaners and, notably, Gaudenza, the pride of the Palio, the annual horseback competition in Siena, Italy. She wrote of dogs and all manner of living things in a characteristic style, weaving the romance and history of mankind's association with the animal world into her illustrated texts.         In fact, Ms. Henry was city-bred and came to her love of animals and nature as an adult. The former Marguerite Breithaupt of Milwaukee  caught a whiff of printer's ink in her father's shop, honed her sense of drama in college and discovered the outdoors when she and her husband, Sidney Crocker Henry, a sales manager, moved to a farm in Wayne, Ill.         Her father owned a printing shop and piqued her interest one rainy Sunday by letting her read proofs. She was 10 and decided to become a writer, too. Delineator magazine  published one of her maiden efforts the next year, and paid for it.         ''It was just one step away from heaven,'' she said later.         At Milwaukee State Teachers' College she wrote prodigiously and acted in plays. She married after graduation and took up writing professionally soon after.         Her articles appeared in trade and business periodicals, and then national publications like The Saturday Evening Post and Reader's Digest. After moving to the farm in 1939, she readily took to country ways and showed it in her first book for children, ''Auno and Tauno: A Story of Finland'' (1940). Next she tackled ''Pictured Geographies,'' a series about Latin American countries for schoolchildren. She also began to write storybooks for the very young, including ''Benjamin West and His Cat Grimalkin''(1947). Researching ''Misty,'' she went to Chincoteague to sit in the sand and sense the island come alive around her.         The same sense of immediacy and adventure characterized her work for four decades. Among the many film and television adaptations that kept her writing alive for new audiences were ''Brighty of the Grand Canyon'' (1967), ''Justin Morgan Had a Horse'' (1972), ''Peter Lundy and the Medicine Hat Stallion'' (1977), ''Story of a Book'' (1980) and, most recently, her 1948 classic, the adventure tale about a white Arabian horse, ''King of the Wind'' (1990).         ''Misty of Chincoteague'' came to the big screen in 1961 and starred David Ladd and Pam Smith. By then the book that inspired it had sold well over a million copies. Sequels included ''Stormy, Misty's Foal'' (1963) and ''Misty's Twilight'' (1992).         Ms. Henry won many awards, including the John Newbery Honor Award for ''Misty of Chincoteague''  and the Newbery Medal for ''King of the Wind.'' She shared some of them with her illustrators, among them Wesley Dennis and Rich Rudish. Her books were translated into a dozen languages.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Ruth Goode, who wrote about subjects as disparate as the scenic attractions of Maine, advancements in medicine and the life of the impresario Sol Hurok, died on Oct. 27 at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         Beginning in 1933, Ms. Goode wrote fiction and nonfiction under her maiden name, Seinfel; her married name, Goode; a pseudonym, Julia Rainer, and anonymously. She was a senior staff writer of MD Medical Newsmagazine for more than 20 years and the ghostwriter of some 20 books on medical, health and child care as well as educational subjects.         Her husband, Gerald, had worked as Mr. Hurok's publicist in the 1930's and 40's, and when the impresario was ready to commit his life to paper, he turned to Ms. Goode. Together, Mr. Hurok and Ms. Goode produced ''Impresario'' in 1946. In it, Mr. Hurok mused about his work in the ballet and concert hall and reminisced about Isadora Duncan, Artur Rubinstein and others.         Ms. Goode and Gertrude Mackenzie produced ''My Love Affair With the State of Maine'' (1955), an account of a New Yorker's -- Ms. Mackenzie's -- magical affair with Goose Rocks Bay in Maine. With Dr. Benjamin R. Miller, Ms. Goode wrote ''Man and His Body'' (1960), which included the most recent discoveries  about DNA, hormones and other topics. And she was co-author with Aaron Sussman of ''The Magic of Walking'' (1967), partly a panegyric about  the benefits of walking and partly an anthology of writings on the subject by famous walkers like Whitman, Thoreau, Nabokov and Dickens.         Ruth Seinfel was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Smith College in 1925 and went to work as a reporter in New York. She was one of the first female reporters to advance beyond the women's pages and interviewed notables like Eleanor Roosevelt and Amelia Earhart for The New York Evening Post. The paper sent her to Europe in the early 1930's, but she turned to freelance writing in 1933.         She and her husband, writing as Jerome and Julia Rainer, published ''Sexual Pleasure in Marriage'' (1959) and ''Sexual Adventure in Marriage'' (1965), books considered harbingers of sexual liberation. She also wrote ''A Book for Grandmothers'' (1977). Her husband died in 1983. She is survived by a son, Daniel, of Manhattan; a daughter, Judith Goode of Boulder, Colo., and two grandchildren.       
         Toby Lelyveld, a teacher of literature who specialized in the stage history of Shakespeare's plays, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Her book, ''Shylock on the Stage'' (Western Reserve University, 1960), traced the way the moneylender in ''The Merchant of Venice'' was played by great actors, including Charles Macklin in 1741, Edmund Kean in 1814, Edwin Booth in 1861 and Henry Irving in 1879.         Noting that Shylock appeared in only 5 of the 20 scenes and had only 30 major speeches, she called the role ''a comparatively scanty part'' -- one that, perhaps more than any other in Shakespeare, was at the mercy of the actor. For that reason, she said, the character's evolution in the 19th and 20th centuries mirrored shifts in social attitudes toward Jews in Britain and the United States.         Mrs. Lelyveld, the former Toby Bookholtz, received her bachelor's degree in 1933 and her master's degree in 1943, both from Teachers College of Columbia University. She received her doctorate in English literature from Columbia in 1951.         She taught at Teachers College, the University of Omaha, Western Reserve University, the Columbia University School of the Arts and the Juilliard School.         From 1948 to 1956, she was the director of the B'nai B'rith Hillel Foundation at Hunter College.         In the 1960's and 1970's, she edited program notes for the Theater Recording Society, Caedmon Records and Spoken Arts Recordings.         Her marriage to Rabbi Arthur J. Lelyveld of Cleveland ended in divorce in 1964.         They had three sons: Joseph, executive editor of The New York Times; David, of Manhattan and Ithaca, N.Y., and Michael, of Lexington, Mass. She is also survived by two sisters, Mildred Rosenbaum and Roslyn Klibanoff, both of Florence, Ala., and five grandchildren.       
         Rosemarie Rogers, a scholar of international migrations and former academic dean at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, died on Nov. 28 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 61.         The cause was multiple myeloma, a form of bone-marrow cancer, said her husband, Peter P. Rogers, a professor of environmental engineering at Harvard University.         Dr. Rogers was a native of Austria, and her fluency in several languages led her to a career in international relations. She lectured in political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology before moving to the Fletcher School, where she advanced to a full professorship and served as academic dean from 1985 to 1987.         Her more than 50 papers, monographs, book chapters and books reflected her research on international migrations, including forced migrations and refugee policies.         At her death she was completing a comparative study of the migration policy of six Western European countries. In it she documented the difficulties host countries have, on the one hand, encouraging migrants to return home, and on the other, integrating them into their own societies.         Her recent research was foreshadowed in an earlier book, ''Guests Come to Stay: The Effects of European Labor Migration on Sending and Receiving Countries'' (1985). Another volume, written with Emily Copeland, ''Forced Migration: Policy Issues in the Post-Cold War World'' (1993), was widely distributed by the United Nations High Commission on Refugees and various national governments.         Dr. Rogers was born Rosemarie Straussnigg in Klagenfurt, Austria, and studied at the Universities of Vienna and Innsbruck, the University of Texas and the Sorbonne. She settled in the United States in 1958 and earned a doctorate in political science at M.I.T. in 1967.         She served on the board of the World Peace Foundation.         Besides her husband, Dr. Rogers is survived by two sons, Christopher, of Cambridge, and Justin, of Albuquerque, N.M.       
         Lillian Disney, the widow of Walt Disney and a prominent patron of the arts, died on Tuesday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles after suffering a stroke on Monday. She was 98.         Mrs. Disney, who met Mr. Disney in the 1920's while working at a low-level job at his fledgling studio, was married to the mogul for 41 years. ''This really is the end of an era for Disney,'' said Roy E. Disney, a nephew of Mrs. Disney's and vice chairman of the Walt Disney Company. He added: ''She was a great lady, full of laughter and fun and always prepared to speak the truth, tough and loving at the same time.''         A publicity-shy figure, Mrs. Disney became highly active in a number of charities after her husband's death in 1966 and emerged as a leading patron of the arts. She helped found the California Institute of the Arts, a somewhat avant-garde school that has produced many of the nation's most formidable animators.         In May 1987, Mrs. Disney made a landmark gift of $50 million to the Music Center of Los Angeles County to build a world-class concert hall for the city. Although plans for the grandiose concert hall had stalled in recent years, mostly because of financial and artistic disagreements, the project was recently revived with a $25 million donation from the Walt Disney Company. It is scheduled to be completed in the year 2001.         During her marriage, Mrs. Disney served as her husband's sounding board and unofficial adviser. By all accounts he would discuss his ideas -- from Snow White to the creation of Disneyland -- with Mrs. Disney and sought her approval.         On a train ride from New York City to Los Angeles, after a serious business setback, Mr. Disney came up with a new character: Mortimer Mouse. ''Not Mortimer,'' said his wife. ''It's too formal. How about Mickey?''         Michael D. Eisner, chairman of the Walt Disney Company, said, ''Mrs. Disney was a full-time partner to Walt and we are all grateful for her contributions in the creation of Mickey Mouse and the Disney Company and the example she set for family life and community service.''         Although a vocal figure behind the scenes, Mrs. Disney rarely spoke publicly and appeared at few Hollywood events. One of the few times she made a public comment came after the publication of a book, ''Walt Disney: Hollywood's Dark Prince'' (1993), by Marc Eliot. The book depicted Walt Disney as a political reactionary, anti-Semite and a Hollywood informer for the Federal Bureau of Investigation.         In a statement, Mrs. Disney said: ''We shared a wonderful, exciting life and we loved every minute of it. He was a wonderful husband to me and a wonderful and loyal father and grandfather. I am distressed to learn of a new book about Walt that actually invents incidents that never happened.''         Last year Mrs. Disney donated $100,000 to the Nez Perce Indians, who were seeking to buy some ancient tribal artifacts. Mrs. Disney grew up in Lapwai, Idaho, on the Nez Perce Indian reservation. Her father worked for the Government as a blacksmith and Federal marshal.         She came to Los Angeles in 1923 to join her older sister, Hazel. A friend of her sister was working at the new Walt Disney studios, and told her about a job opening there. She found a job as a $15-a-week ''inker'' of film frames. She married Walt Disney on July 13, 1925, in Lewiston, Idaho.         A daughter that the Disneys adopted, Sharon Disney, died in 1993. She is survived by another daughter, Diane Disney Miller of Napa, Calif., who has played an important role in the plan for the Disney Concert Hall in downtown Los Angeles. She is also survived by 10 grandchildren and 13 great-grandchildren.       
         Denise Levertov, a poet of intense emotion and fervid political conviction, died on Saturday at the Swedish Hospital in Seattle, where she lived. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lymphoma, said Griselda Ohannessian of New Directions, Ms. Levertov's publisher.         As a poet and political activist, Ms. Levertov was ''a touchstone, a maintainer for our generation,'' the poet Robert Creeley, one of her first publishers in the United States, said yesterday. ''She was a constantly defining presence in the world we shared, a remarkable and transforming poet for all of us. She always had a vivid emotional response and also a completely dedicated sense of political and social need.''         The poet Kenneth Rexroth once wrote that Ms. Levertov was ''the most subtly skillful poet of her generation, the most profound, the most modest, the most moving.''         In the tradition established by William Carlos Williams, she wrote with a concrete immediacy of language. She spoke directly through her poetry, favoring commonplace objects and images over large philosophical concepts.         The author of more than 30 books of poetry, essays and translations, she wrote with great particularity and sensitivity about aspects of love, spiritual as well as erotic. More and more, her work conveyed her political awareness and social consciousness. She was, as in the title of her first book of essays, ''The Poet in the World.'' At the same time, in her art she would contemplate her own life, writing confessional poems about her marital and familial problems. For her, content and form were ''in a dynamic state of interaction.''         In ''The Ache of Marriage,'' she wrote:         The ache of marriage:         thigh and tongue, beloved,         are heavy with it,         it throbs in the teeth         We look for communion         and are turned away, beloved,         each and each         It is leviathan and we         in its belly         looking for joy, some joy         not to be known outside it         two by two in the ark of         the ache of it.         And in ''Of Being,'' she wrote:         I know this happiness         is provisional:         the looming presences --         great suffering, great fear --         withdraw only         into peripheral vision:         but ineluctable this shimmering         of wind in the blue leaves:         this flood of stillness         widening the lake of sky:         this need to dance,         this need to kneel:         this mystery:         A defining moment of her life was the Vietnam War. She helped found a group called the Writers' and Artists' Protest Against the War in Vietnam, she was actively involved in the anti-nuclear movement, and in 1967 she edited a volume of poetry for the War Resisters League. In the same year, she published ''The Sorrow Dance,'' a book of poems whose sorrow included the war and also the death of the poet's sister.         Ms. Levertov was born in Ilford, England. Her father was Paul Philip Levertoff, a Russian Jew who converted to Christianity and became an Anglican priest. Her mother was from Wales. Her father's conversations about the family background in Hasidism and her mother's knowledge of Welsh and English folklore proved influential. Educated by her parents, she was introduced to poetry by her older sister, Olga, and was writing from an early age.         During World War II, she worked as a nurse in London and also began publishing her poetry. In 1940 her first poem appeared in Poetry Quarterly, and, said Mr. Rexroth, he and other poets were soon ''in excited correspondence about her'' as ''the baby of the new Romanticism.'' Her first volume of verse, ''The Double Image,'' was published in 1946.         After the war she married Mitchell Goodman, an American writer, and for several years they lived in France near Mr. Creeley, who was a friend of Mr. Goodman. In 1948 the couple moved to the United States, where Ms. Levertov studied and was influenced by such modernist poets as Williams, Wallace Stevens and Ezra Pound, and also continued her artistic relationship with Mr. Creeley, Robert Duncan and other Black Mountain poets.         Both she and her husband frequently spoke out on political issues, particularly regarding the Vietnam War. Mr. Goodman was convicted along with Dr. Benjamin Spock for counseling resistance of the draft. Ms. Levertov and Mr. Goodman were divorced in 1975. Mr. Goodman died last February. They had one son, Nikolai, who lives in Seattle.         When Ms. Levertov's 11th collection of verse, ''The Freeing of the Dust,'' was published in 1975, the poet David Ignatow wrote in The New York Times Book Review that ''by nearly unanimous agreement Levertov was well on her way to becoming one of our leading poets'' with ''her forceful and compassionate presentations of urban lives'' and ''the beauty and sensuousness of her nature poems.'' By shifting to ''passionate Vietnam poems,'' she had lost some of her following but gained a new vitality.         Ms. Levertov wrote through six decades. In the 1990's, she published ''New and Selected Essays''; four poetry volumes, ''Evening Train,'' ''Sands of the Well,'' ''The Life Around Us: Selected Poems on Nature'' and ''The Stream and The Sapphire: Selected Poems on Religious Themes,'' and the prose memoir  ''Tesserae: Memories and Suppositions.''         She taught at colleges and universities, and served as poetry editor of The Nation and Mother Jones. Among her honors were the Elmer Holmes Bobst Award in poetry and the $50,000 Lannan Prize. In 1996, she won the Governor's Award from the Washington State Commission for the Humanities.         She felt compelled to clarify and justify the uses of poetry in a world of political crisis. In ''New and Selected Essays'' she wrote, ''One is in despair over the current manifestation of malevolent imbecility and the seemingly invincible power of rapacity, yet finds oneself writing a poem about the trout lilies in the spring woods. And one has promised to speak at a meeting or help picket a building. If one is conscientious, the only solution is to attempt to weigh conflicting claims at each crucial moment, and in general to try to juggle well and keep all the oranges dancing in the air at once.''         Ms. Levertov was a masterly juggler of words, images and feelings, as well as a defender of artistic and political liberty.         In ''Overheard Over S.E. Asia,'' she wrote:         I am the snow that burns.         I fall         wherever men send me to fall --         but I prefer flesh, so smooth, so dense:         I decorate it in black, and seek the bone.       
         Veronica Geng, an accomplished parodist who spun out biting pieces for The New Yorker based on chance remarks by hapless politicians and the banalities of wedding announcements, died on Wednesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, said a friend, Barbara Epstein, editor of The New York Review of Books. She was 56.         The cause was a brain tumor, said  Philip Roth, the novelist, who was also a friend.         As a writer of ''casuals,'' the short articles that appear in The New Yorker, she carried on in the tradition of S. J. Perelman. A typical Geng piece was a crazed amalgam of stock phrases, as in an imaginary wedding announcement reprinted in her 1984 collection, ''Partners'': ''The bride, married at the Presbyterian Church and Trust, is an alumna of the Royal Doulton School and Loot University.  Her father is retired from the family consortium. She is also a descendant of Bergdorf Goodman of the Massachusetts Bay Colony. Her previous marriage ended in pharmaceuticals.''         Her 1988 collection, ''Love Trouble Is My Business,'' included a ''letter'' from the proprietor of a dog kennel to ''Secretary Weinberger'' about a defense contractor's $87.25 bill for dog boarding: ''I wear the key to the pantry around my neck on a platinum chain, and not only is the level of the kibble bin measured twice a day but the bin itself is equipped with a state-of-the art laser lock, which cannot be opened without a microcoded propylene wafer.''         Ms. Geng was also an unofficial editor of Mr. Roth's novels. ''I always gave Veronica my books,'' he said shortly before she died.         Ms. Geng was born in 1941 in Atlanta. Her father was a career Army officer. She once told The Christian Science Monitor that she traced her humor to ''Alice in Wonderland,'' read to her from the age of 2. In it, she said, she discovered ''a sense of illogic and how funny illogic is.''         That book ''and the paperback collection of the Watergate transcripts are my two favorite books.'' Ms. Geng said. ''They're not unlike each other.''         She attended the University of Pennsylvania. In the mid-1970's her short parody of the film critic Pauline Kael, published in The New York Review of Books, caught the eye of Roger Angell, a fiction editor at The New Yorker. Mr. Angell gave her a tryout and she went on to become his  assistant.         Mr. Roth credits Ms. Geng with persuading William Shawn, then The New Yorker's editor, to publish his 1979 novella, ''The Ghost Writer,'' in two parts. From then on, he said, he  came to depend on her.         Charles McGrath, a friend and colleague at The New Yorker who is now editor of The New York Times Book Review, said: ''Her thing was high, intellectual comedy.''         In 1992, after Tina Brown took over as editor of The New Yorker, Ms. Geng and Ms. Brown had a falling out. Ms. Geng said she was dismissed; Ms. Brown said she resigned.         Ms. Geng had no immediate survivors.         Correction:  January 1, 1998, Thursday  An obituary of the parodist and editor Veronica Geng on Friday omitted a survivor. He is her brother, Steve Geng of Manhattan.       
         Adelma Grenier Simmons, the author of dozens of books on herbs, died on Wednesday at her home on the Caprilands Herb Farm in Coventry, Conn., which she founded in 1929 and developed into a teaching center and a business. She was 93.         Mrs. Simmons, called ''the first lady of herbs'' by the International Herb Association, used her farm as a school of herbal lore and history. For decades, she delivered a one-hour lecture five days a week to visitors, who were then treated to an herbal lunch in the dining room of her colonial house.         An imposing figure given to wearing a cape, Mrs. Simmons lectured authoritatively but with a touch of humor. ''Silver rosemary is good for mind and memory, in case you have need of that,'' she once told a visiting group. ''It's also good in tea. If you don't like that, you can wash your hair with it. If that doesn't work, you can wash your dog's hair with it.''         Mrs. Simmons, whose maiden name was Grenier, was born in Shelton, Vt., where her father, a French-Canadian, was a cabinetmaker. She moved to Hartford after becoming an international buyer for the Albert Steiger department stores. Her parents soon joined her and also found work with the company, but remained homesick for the country.         In 1929, the family bought an abandoned 50-acre farm near the village of North Coventry, which they named Caprilands, and set about raising goats. The family restored the 18th-century buildings on the site, and Mrs. Simmons grew herbs and vegetables, inviting neighbors over to share in the harvest.         ''Caprilands as it now is started with 25 or 30 women cooking together,'' Mrs. Simmons told an interviewer. ''We all brought things from our gardens.''         In the 1940's, after a disastrous season in which all her vegetables died, Mrs. Simmons concentrated on raising herbs, which she sold as live plants and in dried form.         With the publication of ''Herb Gardening in Five Seasons'' in 1963, Caprilands and Mrs. Simmons herself assumed the dimensions of institutions. The farm drew tourists, gardeners and chefs. One distinguished visitor was David Bouley, a neighbor who frequented the gardens as a boy and, after achieving culinary stardom with his restaurant Bouley, returned annually to cook a five-course dinner for his staff and friends. The menu drew liberally on the 300 herbs grown on the farm's 33 thematic gardens, which include the Saints Garden, devoted to medicinal and food herbs; the Silver Garden, which has only silver plants, and the Shakespeare Garden, dedicated to plants mentioned in Shakespeare's plays.         Mrs. Simmons wrote 35 books and many pamphlets on herbs, including ''Saints in My Garden,'' ''The Witches Brew,'' ''The Gold Wreath Book'' and ''A Merry Christmas Herbal.''         She is survived by her third husband, Edward Cook; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren. A brief first marriage ended in divorce. Her second husband, George Simmons, died in 1965.
