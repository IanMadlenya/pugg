         Dr. Esther Thelen, a psychologist whose research into the way babies develop early motor and mental skills exerted a powerful influence in the field, died on Dec. 29 at a hospital in Bloomington, Ind. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Jennifer Thelen of Richmond, Calif.         Dr. Thelen, a psychology professor at Indiana University, was known for studying childhood development through the conceptual framework called dynamic systems theory. Many psychologists had once believed that babies developed on a relatively rigid timetable, dictated by changes in the brain. But Dr. Thelen proposed that developmental milestones occurred through a complicated interaction involving the brain, the environment, the baby's growing awareness of its body and other factors.         ''She had a profound impact on the way people think about how kids develop,'' said Dr. John Spencer, a psychology professor at the University of Iowa, a friend and former colleague of Dr. Thelen's. ''She really viewed development at the level of the organism, the whole child, and showed that it's not just the genes or the brain but all these things coming together.''         Dr. Thelen also proposed that environmental experiences in the first year of life played an enormous role in shaping the neuronal networks in the brain that determine much of a growing child's abilities -- intellectually, creatively and in other ways.         Dr. Thelen was born on May 20, 1941, in Brooklyn. She attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and in 1977 she received a doctorate in biology from the University of Missouri. She was a member of the university's psychology department until she left for Indiana in 1985.         In addition to her daughter, Dr. Thelen is survived by her husband, David, a history professor at Indiana; a son, Jeremy, of Providence, R.I.; a sister, Harriet Saeck of Sacramento; and one grandson.       
         Joanne Grant, an activist who documented the grassroots efforts behind the civil rights movement through her journalism, filmmaking and commentary, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Midtown Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, her son, Mark Rabinowitz, said.         Ms. Grant wrote ''Black Protest'' (Fawcett, 1968), a documentary analysis of black resistance from 1619 on. One of the first books to trace the origins of the civil rights movement, it remains required reading in many classes on African-American history.         A former assistant to W.E.B. DuBois, Ms. Grant sought to profile the struggle for civil rights through its community leaders. Her award-winning documentary film ''Fundi: The Story of Ella Baker'' (1981), about an unsung matriarch of the civil rights movement, was broadcast nationally on PBS. She later wrote ''Ella Baker: Freedom Bound'' (Wiley, 1998), a biography. In ''Confrontation on Campus'' (New American Library, 1969), she described sit-ins at Columbia University and elsewhere.         ''She was an important voice in the early writing on the civil rights movement,'' said Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, a professor of African-American studies at Harvard. ''Scholars began to realize that you couldn't understand how this became a national phenomenon unless you understood how communities rallied around issues.''         Friends described Ms. Grant as the movement's publicist and said she saw herself as both journalist and advocate. She was a member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee in the 1960's and in later years organized benefits for social causes and political candidates.         In the 1960's, as a reporter for The National Guardian, she often traveled to rural Southern towns to describe demonstrations and organizations that other publications largely ignored.         ''She exposed and explained the civil rights movement in ways that the daily press either couldn't or wouldn't,'' said Julian Bond, chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Joanne Grant Rabinowitz, whose father was white and mother biracial, was born in Utica, N.Y., on March 30, 1930. She graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in history and journalism.         In addition to her son, Mark, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, Victor, a lawyer and activist; a daughter, Abby, of Hamburg, N.J.; a stepson, Peter, of Clinton, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Joni, of Pittsburgh; a half-sister, Mary Jane Hubbard of Norwich, N.Y.; a half-brother, James Hubbard of Orlando, Fla.; and two step-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Janeway, who began her career as a best-selling novelist in the 1940's and later distinguished herself as a critic, a lecturer and an early advocate of the women's movement, died yesterday at a retirement home in Rye, N.Y. She was 91.         Her death was reported by her son Michael Janeway, a writer and editor who is a professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.         Most of Ms. Janeway's earlier books were novels that focused on family situations and occasionally the pressures on women of modern society and were cited for their psychological acuteness and good sense. All the while, she reviewed books for The New York Times and other newspapers, and was credited for helping to introduce English writers like Anthony Powell to an American audience and for defending the artistic merits of ''Lolita,'' by Nabokov.         In the 1970's, she began to write nonfiction books about feminist issues: ''Man's World, Woman's Place: A Study of Social Mythology'' (Morrow, 1971), ''Between Myth and Morning: Women Awakening'' (Morrow, 1974), ''Powers of the Weak'' (Knopf, 1980) and ''Improper Behavior'' (Morrow, 1987), among others.         Despite her conventional-seeming role as a wife and mother, she was always staunch in her support of feminism, remaining friends with women like Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem and Kate Millett, her son said. Reviewing ''Between Myth and Morning'' in The Christian Science Monitor, June Goodwin wrote: ''Of all the writers on the subject of feminism,'' Ms. Janeway ''has the most acceptability in the eyes of men. She has credentials, she is married to a successful man'' -- the economist and writer Eliot Janeway -- ''has children; as recently as 1969 she termed the women's movement 'frivolous and gestural.'''         Ms. Goodwin concluded that women ''need to read books'' like this ''to have their thoughts and experience confirmed and thus to be reinforced for action.''         Elizabeth Hall Janeway was born Oct. 7, 1913, in Brooklyn, the granddaughter of an Episcopal minister and the younger daughter of Charles H. Hall, a naval architect, and Jeanette F. Searle Hall.         After graduating from the Shore Road Academy in Brooklyn, she spent a year, 1930-31, at Swarthmore College. Her son said that because the Depression wiped out her family's savings, she broke off her education to spend a year writing advertising copy for a department store, Abraham & Straus, and handling orders for the Book of the Month Club.         She then went to Barnard College, taking her B.A. degree in 1935.         In 1938, she married Mr. Janeway, who died in 1993. Their second son, William Hall Janeway, a financial executive, also survives her.         In 1943, she published her first novel, ''The Walsh Girls'' (Doubleday), about two New England sisters, one of whom rejoins the other after her German husband's death in a concentration camp. The book was praised by John Dos Passos, and it became a best seller. Six more novels followed, among them ''Daisy Kenyon'' (Doubleday, 1945), which was made into a movie starring Joan Crawford; ''Leaving Home'' (Doubleday, 1953; reissued by CUNY, 1987); and ''Accident'' (Harper & Row, 1964), as well as several books for young people and collections on writing that she edited.         Ms. Janeway was also active on behalf of writers, serving as president of the Authors Guild from 1965 to 1969, a longtime member of the executive board of the American Center of Poets, Essayists and Novelists, a member of the board of directors of the McDowell Colony, and a judge for both the National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prizes.         She was a trustee of Barnard, a fellow of Berkeley College at Yale University and a director of the Legal and Education Fund for the National Organization for Women.         Through her husband's involvement with the Roosevelt and Johnson administrations, she came to know many prominent Washington figures, including Eleanor Roosevelt, about whom she wrote profiles. At the request of Walter Reuther, the labor organizer, Ms. Janeway served as secretary of the National Committee to Aid Families of G.M. Strikers during an auto workers strike against General Motors soon after World War II.       
         Dr. Sonja Buckley, a Yale virologist and investigator who helped in 1970 to identify the Lassa virus, a potentially deadly disease that originated in Africa, died on Feb. 2 in Baltimore. She was 86.         Dr. Buckley died in a nursing home after a series of strokes, said a close friend, Joyce Maclay.         In the Nigerian village of Lassa in 1969, two missionary nurses rapidly became ill and developed symptoms that included high fever and mouth ulcers before they died from what came to be known as Lassa fever. A third nurse in Lassa contracted the virus and was evacuated to Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, where she later recovered. Dr. Buckley, who was part of Yale's Arbovirus Research Unit at the time, began to study the virus, using samples of the nurse's blood.         Working with Dr. Wilbur Downs and Dr. Jordi Casals-Ariet, Dr. Buckley succeeded in using tissue cultures to isolate and identify the virus. In the process, Dr. Casals-Ariet himself fell ill and was treated with antibodies taken from the surviving nurse's blood. He recovered from the illness and lived until last year, when he died at 92. But a laboratory technician, Juan Roman, also contracted the fever and died in 1969.         Because of the risk of contagion, the research on the virus was transferred from Yale to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The virus is transmitted by contact with infected rodents and can be passed from person to person through body fluids.         Dr. Curtis L. Patton, professor of epidemiology of microbial diseases at Yale, said that Dr. Buckley had provided strongly persuasive ''in vitro evidence'' of both the virus and the effectiveness of its antibodies, and ''went on in very remarkable work to demonstrate that antibodies taken from survivors were protective of tissue cultures'' and could be used in treatment.         Lassa fever continues to be endemic in Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It is treated with a combination of antibodies, the antiviral drug ribavirin and what Dr. Patton called ''good, close nursing care.''         Dr. Buckley was born Sonja Grob in Zurich and received her medical degree in 1944 from the University of Zurich, where she was later an instructor in microbiology. In 1941, she married Dr. John J. Buckley, a pathologist also studying in Zurich.         After working as a research assistant at Johns Hopkins, she joined the Sloan-Kettering Institute, where she was chosen as head of the solid tumor program in 1949. Sonja Buckley then joined the Rockefeller Foundation in 1957, working in the foundation's virus laboratories. In 1964, the labs were transferred to Yale and became known as the Arbovirus Research Unit.         Dr. Buckley retired from Yale in 1994. She lived in Stamford, Conn., before moving to Baltimore about five years ago.         She is survived by a sister, Annemarie Kohler of Zurich.       
         Lisa Fittko, who achieved fame, particularly in Germany, by leading Jews and members of the anti-Hitler resistance from Nazi-occupied France to Spain, died on March 12 in Chicago. She was 95.         The cause was pneumonia, said Evelyn Marsh, her niece.         Ms. Fittko emerged from a leftist, artistic family to become active in the resistance to Hitler in the early months of his rule, then fled to continue the fight in other European countries for seven years. For seven tense months in 1940 and 1941, she escorted refugees on a tortuous path over the Pyrenees mountains so they could go on to Spanish and Portuguese ports to seek passage to safe havens.         Many of the people she helped were intellectuals, artists and anti-Nazi organizers. The first refugee she helped was Walter Benjamin, a Marxist literary critic and philosopher whose work has drawn new interest in recent years because of his provocative insights on subjects from consumerism to surrealism.         But that initial mission was thwarted when the Spanish authorities ordered the group to return to France because they lacked proper exit visas, a requirement that had not been enforced in the past and was ignored in the future. Mr. Benjamin died at the age of 48 in Room No.4 on the second floor of the Hotel de Francia, a cheap pension in Port-Bou, Spain, on Sept. 27, 1940, having apparently committed suicide.         Ms. Fittko had earlier helped the philosopher Hannah Arendt, who had been her friend in Paris, get out of a prison in France.         Ms. Fittko and her husband, Hans, became part of the rescue mission of Varian Fry, an American who is credited with saving about 2,000 people, many of them artists and intellectuals, including André Breton, Marc Chagall and Max Ernst.         Miriam Hansen, a professor of English and cinema and media studies at the University of Chicago, said Ms. Fittko became well known in postwar Germany because Germans liked to find and honor people who resisted Hitler. She said Ms. Fittko's death was announced on German radio and television, and obituaries appeared in the major national newspapers. In 1986, the president of West Germany awarded her the Distinguished Medal of Merit, First Class.         In the United States, Ms. Fittko's story was eventually documented in several novels and films, including the 1998 documentary ''Lisa Fittko: But We Said We Will Not Surrender.''         She wrote two books about her experiences. One, ''Escape Through the Pyrenees,'' which was first published in West Germany in 1985, won that country's award for the political book of the year. It was translated into French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, and, in 1991, into English by Northwestern University Press. The same press in 1993 published her ''Solidarity and Treason: Resistance and Exile, 1933-1940.''         Lisa Ekstein was born in 1909 in Uzhgorod in what was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire; it later became part of Czechoslovakia, then part of the Soviet Union and today is part of Ukraine. Most of her childhood was spent in Budapest and Vienna; she was evacuated and sent to the Netherlands with other children for a year during World War I. After the war, her family moved to Berlin.         Through her father, a writer and a publicist for avant-garde artists there, she met many members of the Weimar intelligentsia.         While still in high school, she joined what Ms. Hansen characterized as a Communist organization. She wrote and distributed leaflets protesting torture in Nazi prisons.         At 24 she was working as a secretary and went to a rally to see Hitler. She was reprimanded for not raising her arm in salute. She told an interviewer from The Vancouver Sun in 1999 that her failure to do so was hardly intentional.         ''I was stupid, but not that stupid,'' she said.         She was soon pursued by the Gestapo, and in 1933, she fled to Prague, where she met Hans Fittko, a fellow exile and an even more committed leftist whom the Nazis sought to kill. They married on their odyssey through, among other places, Basel and Amsterdam, ending up in Paris in 1938. There, they continued helping refugees.         After Germany invaded France, Ms. Fittko was detained for a few months in a concentration camp for women at Gurs, France, along with others who had lived in Germany. It was there she aided her friend and fellow prisoner Hannah Arendt by helping to supply her with a stolen release document.         After the Fittkos found each other again, they made their way to Marseille, dodging the French authorities who were collaborating with the Germans. They planned to escape through Spain but separated because the Spanish had begun arresting men who they feared might make their way to Britain to fight Hitler.         Mr. Fittko tried to find sea passage from Marseille to Casablanca. His wife, as originally planned, had gone to the border to find a way to escape by land. In September 1940, Walter Benjamin knocked on the door of her room in Port-Vendres, saying Mr. Fittko had told him to ask her for help.         With the assistance of a local socialist mayor, who gave her an old map, she led Mr. Benjamin and two other refugees across the mountains to Port-Bou, a Spanish border town. Mr. Benjamin died there after swallowing some of the 50 morphine tablets he had earlier split with his friend Arthur Koestler.         Mr. Benjamin had been carrying a heavy, bulging briefcase that he told Ms. Fittko contained ''the only copy of his latest writing.'' She wrote that he said it was ''more important than I am, more important than myself.''         The briefcase was lost after his death and its contents remain unknown.         For years people suspected that it might have been his lost work on the Parisian arcades, iron-and-glass-roofed shopping corridors, which provoked penetrating philosophical insights on the part of Mr. Benjamin. But those papers were discovered in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, where Mr. Benjamin's friend the essayist Georges Batailles had hidden them from the Nazis. They were published in West Germany in 1982.         Howard Eiland, who translated them as ''The Arcades Project,'' published in 1999 by Harvard University Press, said the contents of the lost briefcase remained a mystery. He said, ''This sounds like it was something completely different that no one knows about.''         Ms. Fittko was soon joined on the French side of the border by her husband, who had not been able to find sea passage. They delayed their own escape when Mr. Fry asked them to help take refugees into Spain. They pretended to be vineyard workers and took people across the mountains on what was called the F route (for Fittko) two or three times a week for seven months. The number of those they helped is sometimes estimated in the hundreds; not one was caught, they said.         The Fittkos eventually escaped to Cuba, then went on to Chicago, where Ms. Fittko's brother lived. Mr. Fittko died in 1960, and Ms. Fittko left no immediate survivors.         She returned to Spain several times to look for Mr. Benjamin's lost briefcase, but never found it.         Correction:  March 22, 2005, Tuesday  An obituary yesterday about Lisa Fittko, the anti-Hitler activist, misspelled the surname of the French essayist who helped hide the writings of Walter Benjamin, the German literary critic and philosopher. He was Georges Bataille, not Batailles.       
         Katherine A. Lathrop, a pioneering researcher in nuclear medicine and a member of a University of Chicago team that developed an isotope widely used to locate and diagnose cancers, died on March 10 at a nursing home in Las Cruces, N.M. She was 89.         The cause was advanced dementia, her family said.         A versatile scientist with degrees in biology, chemistry and physics, Ms. Lathrop was named a professor of radiology at Chicago, where she taught for four decades, without having received a doctorate.         In 1945 and 1946, she participated in the Manhattan Project as a junior chemist in the metallurgical laboratory in Chicago, studying the effects of radioactive materials on animals. Later, as part of a research effort led by Dr. Paul V. Harper, she investigated the qualities of technetium, a radioactive element discovered in the 1930's.         Ms. Lathrop and the Chicago team experimented with an isotope, technetium 99m, by injecting it into a patient's bloodstream and then tracing its path through the brain, heart, kidney, liver and other organs.         A scan of the isotope, also called a radionuclide or radiotracer, yielded images to help diagnose and record the size and growth of cancers and other tumors. Dr. Harper's team also found technetium was less radioactive and had a shorter half-life than many other isotopes, and was therefore less dangerous to patients. A scanning system for technetium was perfected in 1963 and was used to perform a successful brain scan. The isotope remains in clinical use worldwide and is often used to scan bones.         Dr. Robert Beck, an emeritus professor of radiology at Chicago and a member of Dr. Harper's team, recalled that Ms. Lathrop was ''an indispensable part of Paul Harper's team.''         Dr. Beck added, ''After that initial successful scan, the field of nuclear medicine took a major and continuing upward turn.''         Katherine Gray Austin was born in Lawton, Okla. She graduated from Oklahoma State University, where she also received a master's degree in chemistry in 1939.         Ms. Lathrop was appointed an associate biochemist at the Argonne National Laboratory, where she worked from 1947 to 1954. She next joined the staff of the Argonne Cancer Research Hospital, now the Franklin McLean Memorial Research Institute, which is affiliated with the University of Chicago. In 1978, she was appointed professor of radiology at Chicago, a position she held until retiring in 1985.         Ms. Lathrop served as chairwoman of the Society of Nuclear Medicine's Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee from 1977 to 1984.         Ms. Lathrop lived in Hyde Park, Ill., before moving to Las Cruces last year.         She is survived by a son, Dr. David Lathrop, a physiologist at the National Institutes of Health, of Gaithersburg, Md.; three daughters, Laura Fowler of Santa Fe, N.M., Jane Grider of Las Cruces and Julia Smiddy of Valparaiso, Ind.; a sister, Billie Carol Austin of Denver; a brother, John C. Austin of Duncan, Okla.; 10 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Nellie McCaslin, a theater historian and educator considered the country's leading authority on children's theater, died on Feb. 28 at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications after a heart attack, her niece and survivor, Alexandra Plotkin, said.         Until her retirement in 1985, Dr. McCaslin was a professor of educational theater at New York University; she continued to teach at N.Y.U.'s Steinhardt School of Education until 2002. She wrote two college textbooks considered classics in the field: ''Theater for Children in the United States: A History'' (University of Oklahoma, 1971) and ''Creative Drama in the Classroom and Beyond,'' to be published by Allyn & Bacon this spring in its eighth edition. She also published numerous scholarly articles, as well as books and plays for children.         Though drama by and for children is considered a ghetto by many theater professionals, to Dr. McCaslin it was a serious artistic enterprise. Theater, she wrote in a 1990 article, ''is finding recognition as an art that contributes to the emotional, intellectual and social development of the child.''         Nellie McCaslin was born in Cleveland on Aug. 20, 1914. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees from what was then Western Reserve University and, in 1957, a Ph.D. from N.Y.U. She joined the university's faculty in 1972 and from 1973 to 1985 was director of undergraduate studies at N.Y.U.'s Gallatin School of Individualized Study.Dr. McCaslin was a past president of the Children's Theater Association of America and in 1996 received the lifetime achievement award of the American Alliance for Theater in Education.         In her late 80's, after a hiatus of four decades, Dr. McCaslin returned to the stage as an actor.         ''She was very well loved down here,'' said R. Rex Stephenson, artistic director of the Blue Ridge Dinner Theater in Virginia, who cast Dr. McCaslin in several shows, including a production of ''Steel Magnolias'' last year. ''She's probably the only person that could cash a check from New York in Rocky Mount, Va., because everybody knew who she was.''       
         Dr. Jeanne Petrek, a cancer researcher known for her investigations into the aftermath of breast cancer surgery, especially its impact on fertility, was killed in an accident in Manhattan on Monday. She was 57 and lived in Bronxville, N.Y.         Dr. Petrek died in surgery, hours after being struck by an ambulette while crossing the street at Second Avenue and 64th Street. At the time, she was on her way to work at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where she directed the surgical program at the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center.         At the time of her death, she was also an attending surgeon in the Breast Service of Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Department of Surgery, and a professor of surgery at Cornell University School of Medicine.         Dr. Petrek was a leading expert on pregnancy-associated breast cancer and the causes of lymphedema, a swelling in the arm and hand that can develop after removal of lymph nodes under the arm. Lymphedema is one of the most common complications after the procedure.         In her 20 years at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, she treated more than 4,000 women and sought ways to provide them not just a longer life but a better one after recovery. One method she pursued was to limit the removal to only one or two lymph nodes -- the sentinel nodes, as they are known -- to which the cancer was likely to spread first, as determined by biopsy.         ''The hallmark of Jeanne Petrek's career was that she was the ultimate patient advocate,'' said Patrick Borgen, chief of the breast service. He said that while most public spending promoted the search for treatments aimed at prolonging life, Dr. Petrek hoped to improve the quality of life for cancer patients.         Dr. Borgen said Dr. Petrek borrowed a euphemism from the military, ''collateral damage,'' to refer to unwanted aftereffects of cancer therapy. Much of her work focused on the means of countering them with hormonal and other treatments.         A central question for Dr. Petrek, Dr. Borgen said, was: ''How safe was it for a young woman to get pregnant after breast cancer?''         She sought the answer in a 10-year study she was about to complete on the changes in ovarian function resulting from breast cancer treatment, like premature menopause, infertility and the overall effect on the quality of the patient's life. She followed the histories of 800 women 44 and younger who had undergone chemotherapy. About half of them were still menstruating after five years, she told The New York Times last September.         According to Memorial Sloan-Kettering, hers was the first extensive study ever undertaken of the safety of pregnancy for such women. Some preliminary findings will be reported to the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Orlando, Fla., next month, Dr. Borgen said. He said Dr. Petrek's investigation would be completed by Dr. Kimberly Van Zee, a senior researcher who had been part of it from the start.         Jeanne Petrek was born in Youngstown, Ohio. She graduated in 1969 from Case Western Reserve, where she also received her medical degree in 1973. After her internship and residency in surgery at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, she first came to Memorial Sloan-Kettering on a surgical oncology fellowship in 1978-80.         From 1980 to 1984 she was an assistant professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine and was on the staffs of Grady Memorial and Emory University Hospitals. She continued her academic career at Cornell in 1984 when she returned to Memorial Sloan-Kettering as an assistant attending surgeon in the breast service of the medicine department.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jeffrey M. Duban; a daughter, Jean Petrek-Duban of Brooklyn; a son, Paul Petrek-Duban of Bronxville; her mother, Emily Petrek of Manhattan; three brothers, John Petrek of Bainbridge Island, Wash., Jim Petrek of Danville, Calif., and Jerry Petrek of Denver.       
         Helen Jackson Wilkins Claytor, a pivotal figure in the racial desegregation of the Y.W.C.A. and its first African-American president, died yesterday in Grand Rapids, Mich. She was 98.         Her death was announced by her son, Roger Wilkins, the Robinson professor of history and American culture at George Mason University.         Mrs. Claytor, a longtime civil rights leader in Grand Rapids, served two terms, from 1967 to 1976, as national president of the Young Women's Christian Association. As a board member and a national organizer since the 1940's, she had been a strong force in the racial integration of the organization at all levels.         Helen Natalie Jackson was born in Minneapolis and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Minnesota in 1928. She went to work for what was then the separate ''Negro'' branch of the segregated Y.W.C.A. in Kansas City, Mo., and stayed there until the death in 1941 of her first husband, Earl Wilkins, a journalist.         She then joined the newly established race relations office of the national Y.W.C.A. in New York. As secretary for interracial education, she traveled throughout the South in a campaign to desegregate the local Y's.         She became a member of the Y.W.C.A.'s board in 1945. Once she was national president, she oversaw the adoption of an amendment to the organization's constitution that buttressed the changes she had helped bring about. Its main provision warned that any local affiliate not ''fully integrated in policy and practice'' would be expelled for not living up to the Y's principles.         Mrs. Claytor moved to Grand Rapids in 1943 after her marriage to her second husband, Dr. Robert Claytor, a physician, who died in 1993.         Besides her son, who lives in Washington, she is survived by two daughters from her second marriage, Judith A. Claytor of Grand Rapids, and Sharon Claytor Peters of Lansing, Mich.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandson.       
         Elizabeth McFarland Hoffman, who as poetry editor of Ladies' Home Journal sandwiched the work of W.H. Auden, Adrienne Rich and Sylvia Plath in between ''Is Your Marriage a Masquerade?'' and ''Bing Crosby's Kitchen for His Bride,'' died last Thursday in Philadelphia. She was 83 and had homes in Swarthmore, Pa., and Harborside, Me.         The cause was complications after cardiac surgery, her husband, Daniel Hoffman, said.         While Ms. Hoffman was at Ladies' Home Journal, from 1948 to 1962, the magazine published at least a half-dozen poems in each monthly issue. Major 20th-century writers whose verse appeared there included Marianne Moore, John Ciardi, Mark Van Doren, Randall Jarrell, Maxine Kumin, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Walter de la Mare, Galway Kinnell, Maxwell Anderson and John Updike.         Ms. Hoffman's own poems, published under her maiden name, also appeared in the magazine. She left Ladies' Home Journal in 1962, after its new owners stopped publishing poetry.         Elizabeth McFarland was born on May 3, 1922, in Harrisburg, Pa. As a teenager, she won a national poetry contest sponsored by Scholastic magazine; she later became Scholastic's poetry editor.         In 1948, she married Mr. Hoffman. He survives her, as do a son, MacFarlane Hoffman of Swarthmore; a daughter, Kate H. Siddiqi of Philadelphia; and two sisters, Nancy Ranew of Milton, Fla.; and Janice Volz of New York City.         The poems in Ladies' Home Journal were generally short, but Ms. Hoffman paid top rates: $10 a line. (In contrast, Poetry magazine paid 50 cents a line in the early 1950's, Mr. Hoffman, a prominent poet, said.)         Usually set in a box in the middle of a page, the poems created some arresting juxtapositions. In the August 1950 issue, ''Secrets,'' by Auden, follows an ad for Velveeta. In September 1956, ''Where the Bodies Break,'' by Mr. Kinnell, shares a page with ''How to Make 10 Tantalizing Butter Waffles With That Tender Melt-Away Texture.''         Readers of the June 1953 issue, which featured ''A Glass of Summer Daisies,'' by Jessamyn West, could, a page later, contemplate the question, ''Did you wake up today with 'morning mouth'?''         The magazine had a history of such juxtapositions. Under Edward Bok, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer who edited Ladies' Home Journal from 1889 to 1919, it published fiction by Sarah Orne Jewett, Bret Harte and Rudyard Kipling alongside articles on childrearing, Jennifer Scanlon, the author of ''Inarticulate Longings: The Ladies' Home Journal, Gender, and the Promises of Consumer Culture'' (Routledge, 1995), said in a telephone interview yesterday.         In the 1950's, women's magazines were tantalizing readers with similar mixed signals. ''The message of the Ladies' Home Journal and magazines like that is, 'Hey, we're willing to acknowledge the choices that women have in life, but in the end, we will maintain that most women will choose home and family,''' Professor Scanlon, a historian at Bowdoin College, said. ''The magazines reveal the tensions, as well as the message, of conformity.''       
         Frieda Zames, a prominent advocate for the disabled who lobbied to make New York City accessible to them, died yesterday morning at her home in Manhattan. She was 72.         The cause has not been determined, said Anne Emerman, a longtime friend. She said Ms. Zames had been recovering at home from a recent appendectomy.         Ms. Zames, a retired mathematics professor, was a past president of Disabled in Action of Metropolitan New York, an advocacy group. At her death, she was a vice president of the organization.         Over the last several decades, Ms. Zames, who used a motorized scooter because of the effects of childhood polio, worked to improve access in places like subway stations, movie theaters, stores, restaurants and public restrooms. Her work helped make city buses wheelchair-accessible beginning in the 1980's; in recent years, she lobbied for wheelchair access to taxis and ferryboats.         With her sister, Doris Zames Fleischer, Ms. Zames wrote ''The Disability Rights Movement: From Charity to Confrontation'' (Temple University, 2001), a historical survey.         Frieda Zames was born in Brooklyn in 1932. She earned an undergraduate degree from Brooklyn College and a doctorate in mathematics from New York University. Until her retirement, she taught for many years at the New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark.         In addition to her sister, of Brooklyn, Ms. Zames is survived by her partner of more than 30 years, Michael Imperiale.       
         Vera Komarkova, a botanist and mountain climber who was among the first women to scale some of the world's highest peaks, died on May 25 in her home in Leysin, Switzerland. She was 62.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, her family said.         In the fall of 1978 the American Women's Himalayan Expedition left the United States for Annapurna in Nepal, the 10th highest mountain in the world. Dr. Komarkova and her climbing partner Irene Miller, now Beardsley, with the help of two Sherpa guides, became the first women and the first Americans to reach the summit.         ''She was an incredibly strong, dedicated climber,'' said Arlene Blum, who led the 10-woman expedition. ''Vera was one of the strongest on our team.''         At the time, it was only the fourth expedition to reach the top, and Annapurna is now thought to be one of the most dangerous of the world's 8,000-meter mountains, a class that includes Everest. Two other members of the team fell to their deaths in the attempt.         It was then generally believed that women were not physically and emotionally strong enough to endure such demanding climbs, and women had problems getting climbing permits or joining men's teams, Ms. Blum and Ms. Beardsley said.         Most of the roughly $80,000 needed for their trip was raised by a T-shirt campaign with the slogan ''A Woman's Place Is on Top.''         In 1984, Dr. Komarkova led another successful Himalayan expedition, to Cho Oyu in Tibet, the world's sixth highest peak. She and her partner were the first women to reach that summit, and it was her last major climb.         Vera Komarkova was born in Pisek, Czechoslovakia, in 1942. Her father was a scientist at Charles University in Prague, where she would earn a master's degree in biology and chemistry in 1964. Throughout her youth, she climbed in Europe, scaling mountains in the Tatras, Carparthians, and the Alps.         Dr. Komarkova studied at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and earned a Ph.D. in biology in 1976. She later became an American citizen.         For her dissertation, Dr. Komarkova produced a detailed study of the alpine flora of the Niwot Range in the Colorado Rockies.         It was published as a two-volume book, ''Alpine Vegetation of the Indian Peaks Area'' (Cramer, Vaduz; 1979), and remains the definitive work on the subject, according to her adviser, Patrick Webber, now of Michigan State University.         She stayed with the university's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research for several years, climbing the tallest North American mountains and meeting many of the women she would later join on the Himalayan expeditions.         In 1986, Dr. Komarkova moved back to Europe to join the staff of the American College of Switzerland, a campus of Schiller International University, at Leysin. She was a professor of science, primarily alpine ecology, and later a professor of information technology.         She is survived by her mother, Tatiana Ruzickova of Pisek, the Czech Republic; and two sons, Mipam Moudry of Bossonnens, Switzerland, and Dorje Moudry of Leysin.       
         Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, an educator who concluded that bored high school students should be sent straight to college and started Simon's Rock College to prove the point, died on Monday in Canaan, Conn. She was 95.         Her death was announced by Judith Monachina, spokeswoman for the college, in Great Barrington, Mass., which is now part of Bard College. Mrs. Hall, as the headmistress of a girls' prep school, perceived that adolescents were maturing faster than in the past, and that high schools were not meeting the challenge. So in 1964, she began what she called ''an early college'' for young women. Students who otherwise would have been in the last two years of high school instead took the first two years of college.         Leon Botstein, president of Bard, explained in an interview that Mrs. Hall abhorred the way adolescents were ''infantilized,'' when they were capable of doing high-level academic work. He said that her ideas had been adopted by more and more colleges, and that Bard itself had intensified its ''early-college'' efforts by beginning a high school in New York City in 2001 to teach college-level courses.         The later Bard program received funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has also given millions to other early college programs on the theory they will help reduce dropout rates. Tom Vander Ark, executive director of the foundation's education program, credited Mrs. Hall's inspiration.         Mrs. Hall's mission was intensely personal. In addition to spending more than $6 million of her own, she gave 200 acres of her family's farmland, buildings included, to start the college, which became coeducational in 1970. She named it for a rock on which she had played as a child.         Elizabeth Blodgett was born in Manhattan on Nov. 16, 1909. Her father made a fortune in the chewing gum industry.         She later attended public and private schools in the Great Barrington area. She graduated from Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield, Mass., in 1928, and then attended Knox College for a year.         In 1930, she married Livingston Hall, who was later a professor and administrator at Harvard Law School. After having four children, she entered Radcliffe College, one of the first adults to do so, and graduated in 1946.         After holding several other jobs, she became head of the history department, then headmistress, at the Concord Academy, a private girls' school in Concord, Mass. An article in Mademoiselle in 1969 said she turned ''a genteel finishing school'' into ''one of the most dynamic girls' preparatory schools in the East.''         It was a time when educators were scrambling to jump-start education to keep up with the Russians, in space and elsewhere. Initiatives ranged from Advanced Placement courses that allowed students to do college-credit work while still in high school to the experimental admissions of bright high school students.         Earlier, in the 1930's, Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago and a philosopher of education, had admitted academically superior 16-year-olds as freshmen. European universities had long allowed such acceleration.         What Mrs. Hall was doing was different in that she established a residential college expressly for high school aged students, putting it somewhere between a prep school and a college, with resultant tensions. For example, students complained about rules forbidding overnight room visits by members of the opposite sex.         There have been accusations over the years between the students and the administration as the college sought to find ways to restrict students' behavior without being harsh.         Mrs. Hall faced frequent criticism from both faculty and students. In an interview with Berkshire Week in 1988, she recalled that she fought against ''self-pity'' before resigning, partly as a result of such criticism, in 1972 . She remained a trustee.         Mrs. Hall's husband died in 1995. She is survived by her sons, Thomas Livingston Hall of San Francisco, and John Kendrick Hall of Jerusalem; her daughters, Margaret Hall Whitfield Courant of Great Barrington and Elizabeth Hall Richardson of Denver; 11 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.         Correction:  July 21, 2005, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, who founded Simon's Rock College, now part of Bard College, referred incorrectly in some copies to the given name of the president of Bard, who commented on her legacy. He is Leon Botstein, not Leo.       
         Mary Ann Malkin, a noted rare-book collector and editor who for nearly two decades helped run AB Bookman's Weekly, the well-thumbed bible of the rare- and secondhand-book business that inflamed and then often sated the acquisitive passions of book collectors around the world, died on Aug. 1 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         Mrs. Malkin apparently died in her sleep, said Eric Holzenberg, the director of the Grolier Club of New York, the bibliophilic organization, which announced the death.         Mrs. Malkin, who signed her many book reviews in the magazine with just her initials, was known to generations of rare-book dealers and collectors simply as Mam.         With her husband, Solomon, she ran AB, as it was fondly known in the trade, from 1953 to 1972. (The initials stood for Antiquarian Bookman, the journal's original title.) In later years, Mrs. Malkin became an internationally recognized rare-book collector, amassing a library of historical books on dance notation that is considered the finest in the world.         In the decades after World War II, the mail-order secondhand-book trade was a flourishing enterprise, and AB, founded in 1948, was its chief avenue of communication. Eagerly awaited, greedily pored over and tenderly dog-eared, the journal was almost certainly the only bound artifact that any of its 10,000 subscribers -- rare-book dealers, librarians and private collectors -- would have ever considered marking up.         For 19 years, the Malkins ran the magazine from an office in downtown Newark where every horizontal surface, and many not-quite-horizontal ones, boiled over with centuries of books, papers and pamphlets. Sol. Malkin, who with the typographic exactitude of a cataloguer always spelled his nickname with a period, was AB's owner, editor and publisher. Mrs. Malkin was the administrative assistant, copy editor, proofreader, book critic and maker of coffee, which, for Mr. Malkin, had to be several parts cognac.         Thick, digest-sized and printed on very cheap paper, AB offered trade news, gossip and articles about book collecting. But it was for the classified ads that the journal was prized. Through its Books Wanted and Books for Sale departments, AB united far-flung collectors with dealers around the world, any one of whom just might happen to have a long-sought title in stock. (''Wanted: Any books on horse named Cruiser by Rary, Brown or others, ca. 1870?'' a listing in the issue of Jan. 3, 1953, read.)         Some of the ads catered to highbrow tastes. In December 1953, a dealer in Milwaukee offered an early edition of Gertrude Stein's 1925 novel, ''The Making of Americans,'' signed by Alice B. Toklas, for $12.50.         Others spoke of baser needs. ''Wanted: Spicy pulps of the 30's. Pep, Ginger, Paris Nights, Spicy Detective, Tattle Tales, etc.,'' a 1965 ad read.         Still others were simply bewildering, like this one, from March 22, 1965: ''Wanted: Anything on 'raining' of unusual objects -- frogs, toads, fish, beads, etc. -- falling or 'raining' from the sky.''         Mary Ann O'Brian was born on March 13, 1913, in Altoona, Pa. She earned an undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1937, married a professor and moved with him to New York. The marriage ended in divorce, and she took a secretarial job with R.R. Bowker, then the parent company of Publishers Weekly, the book-industry trade magazine.         In 1948, Bowker started publishing Antiquarian Bookman, which had begun as a column in Publishers Weekly, as a stand-alone magazine, with Mr. Malkin as editor. The Malkins married around this time. Mr. Malkin bought Antiquarian Bookman in 1953, changing its name in 1967.         Mr. Malkin, who sold AB in 1972, died in 1986. Faced with rising competition from online used-book sellers, the magazine ceased publication in 1999. Today the Web site abbookman.com, owned by Intergalactic Inc., an Arizona used-bookstore chain that bought the rights to the name, offers information for dealers and collectors but does not sell books directly.         Mrs. Malkin leaves no immediate survivors. Her collection of dance books is now housed at Penn State. The university is also the distributor of a book she wrote with several colleagues, ''Dancing by the Book: A Catalogue of Books, 1531-1804, in the Collection of Mary Ann O'Brian Malkin.'' Published privately in 2003, the book can be obtained in very clean copies, with hard covers (no dust jacket) and many handsome illustrations.       
         Nell I. Mondy, a Cornell biochemist who extolled the nutritional benefits of the potato to consumers worldwide and pushed hard to dispel its reputation as a weighty clump of empty calories, died on Aug. 25 at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 83.         The cause was complications after an operation, said a friend, Marion Howe.         After early research in vitamins, Dr. Mondy became passionate about potatoes in the 1950's, drawn by their nutritional richness, low cost and long life in storage.         In her four decades at Cornell, she compared the taste of different varieties, examined color changes in potatoes and continually promoted their value as a staple food providing amino acids, protein, calcium, vitamin C, iron and other nutrients. In fact, Dr. Mondy said that meals of potatoes and milk provided enough nutrition for a healthy diet.         Dr. Robert L. Plaisted, an emeritus professor of plant breeding at Cornell, said that Dr. Mondy tested big king, Atlantic, Katahdin and other potato varieties, and investigated why some varieties darkened after cooking, a trait considered undesirable by consumers. She also assembled panels of potato tasters to better define the subtleties of different varieties, and then tried to explain differences on a biochemical basis.         In 1987, Dr. Mondy's research created a public stir when she and a graduate student, Barry Gosselin, released a study suggesting that a naturally occurring toxic compound found in potatoes could be hazardous to human health.         The compounds, called glycoalkaloids, become concentrated in the potato skin, especially when exposed to light, but enormous quantities would have to be eaten to result in harm. Regardless, Dr. Mondy recommended removing the skins.         In the 1990's, she reported other potential health hazards from potato skins. Dr. Mondy and others found that chemicals sprayed on potatoes to prevent sprouting in storage often arrived at the grocery store in significantly higher levels than federal guidelines recommended.         She also promoted potatoes as a crop for developing countries, particularly in Africa.         Nell Irene Mondy was born in Pocahontas, Ark. She earned an undergraduate degree from Ouachita Baptist College and a master's degree from the University of Texas. In 1953, Cornell awarded her a doctorate in biochemistry.         Dr. Mondy was appointed an associate professor of food and nutrition at Cornell in 1953, and became a professor there in 1961. While at Cornell, she was a consultant to Frito-Lay, Procter & Gamble and other food companies before retiring in 1992.         She wrote an autobiography, ''You Never Fail Until You Stop Trying: The Story of a Pioneer Woman Chemist,'' in 2001.         She lived in Ithaca.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Mary Lee Settle, a master of historical fiction who recreated time and place with visceral, almost fanatical accuracy, died Tuesday at a hospice in Charlottesville, Va. She was 87 and made her home in Charlottesville.         The cause was lung cancer, said her son, Christopher Weathersbee.         Ms. Settle, who was a National Book Award winner and the author of the novels known as ''The Beulah Quintet,'' explained her research process in an introduction to ''O Beulah Land,'' the first in an interconnected five-book saga that spanned three centuries, from Cromwell's England to what Ms. Settle called ''the feudal coal culture'' of West Virginia, her native state.         To inform her book, she wrote, it was necessary to ''let the past become a present, let it fall beyond intelligence into reliving, which is true sensuous recall, where dreams come from with all their fears and future hopes of things long past.''         ''The Beulah Quintet'' novels, written between 1956 and 1982, were linked by an exploration of the ways American concepts of personal freedom evolved, and began with the journey of former English prisoners to West Virginia's Kanawha Valley (called Beulah in the novels). For instance, the plot of ''The Scapegoat'' (1980), the fourth volume, unfolds during a violent 1912 confrontation between miners and owners. The other books are ''Know Nothing'' (1960), ''Prisons'' (written in 1973, years after ''O Beulah Land,'' but labeled Book I because the action takes place earlier in history) and ''The Killing Ground'' (1982).         But Ms. Settle's work ranged far beyond her birthplace, geographically and otherwise. In 1978, she received the National Book Award for ''Blood Tie,'' the story of American and British expatriates in Turkey. She had been living there, well aware of the sociocultural influences that traveled both ways between natives and outsiders. Reviewing the novel in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard wrote that the American and British characters were ''like so many Typhoid Marys, carrying the disease of change, change as a fever, wherever they go.''         If Ms. Settle's work was never wildly fashionable -- possibly because ''I don't write about being vaguely unhappy in Connecticut,'' she once said -- that allowed it to age well.         In her historical novels, readers could be assured that the characters spoke pretty much the way people in their time and place spoke, or as close to it as was humanly possible to determine. Ms. Settle had been known to spend months on end reading letters and other accounts from the period she was researching without taking a single note. ''She believed that the key to understanding these people was in their words,'' said Starling Lawrence, her editor at W.W. Norton. So she simply immersed herself in them.         ''Ye're no more nor 19, if that,'' a character in ''O Beulah Land'' tells a new acquaintance. In ''I, Roger Williams: Fragment of an Autobiography'' (2001), Williams has low opinions of ''brabble'' and ''fribbling matters.''         Ms. Settle, always sympathetic to other writers and an advocate of their causes, decided that authors should have their own awards program, with the winners chosen by fellow authors. That way the selections would be independent of publishing industry influences. The idea turned into the PEN/Faulkner award, which began in 1980 and which, with a $15,000 grand prize, has become the largest of the country's major fiction awards.         Mary Lee Settle was born on July 29, 1918, in Charleston, W.Va., the daughter of Joseph Edward and Rachel Tompkins Settle. Her father was a civil engineer in charge of worker safety at coal mines. That industry ran into financial difficulties even before the Depression. More than a half century later, Ms. Settle recalled ''the brave Christmas dinner of 1930'' when she and her parents were living with her grandmother ''because the bottom had dropped out of the coal business.'' Ms. Settle attended Sweet Briar College in Virginia for two years, then began a career as a fashion model. ''I took for granted the kind of looks that other women envied and that I treated with a slight contempt,'' she wrote at the age of 69, contemplating the advisability of face-lifts. She is also said to have been given a screen test, along with half of Hollywood, for the role of Scarlett O'Hara in ''Gone With the Wind.''         During World War II she went to England and served in the women's branch of the Royal Air Force, an experience she recounted later in ''All the Brave Promises: Memories of Aircraft Woman Second Class 2146391.''         In New York after the war, she worked as a magazine editor, but briefly. She often told the story of how, while going over a Harper's Bazaar fashion layout that had been inspired by ''Wuthering Heights,'' she noticed in some notes that Emily Brontë had died at 30. It was then, she said, that she decided she had better start on the books she was planning to write, walked into the boss's office and resigned.         Nine years later her first book was published. ''The Love Eaters'' (1954) was about a small-town theater company. She went on to write 22 books, the most recent being ''Spanish Recognitions'' (2004), a travel memoir.         Ms. Settle traveled extensively and lived abroad at various periods in her life for various reasons. In the late 1960's she fulfilled a promise that many of her fellow Democrats had made to themselves. In 1987, she explained it to Nancy Carol Joyner of Western Carolina University: ''I said if Nixon was elected president I was going back to Europe. He was, and I did.''         Ms. Settle married three times and divorced twice. Her first two husbands, Rodney Weathersbee (1939-46) and Douglas Newton (1946-56), were British. In 1978, when she was 60, she married William L. Tazewell, an American writer and historian. He died in 1998.         Like many authors, she had an academic career as well. Her longest association was with Bard College, where she was an associate professor from 1965 to 1976. She also taught at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, where she lived on and off throughout her life.         Ms. Settle never let age slow her writing career. ''Spanish Reflections'' was based on a trip that she took in her early 80's, after finishing ''I, Roger Williams.''         At the time of her death she was working on ''Tom: An Appreciation of Thomas Jefferson,'' an ''imagined biography'' focusing on Jefferson's youth. Her son said it was not yet clear whether the book was in shape for publication.         In addition to her son, now living in Charlottesville, she is survived by a granddaughter, Beatrice Weathersbee, of Portsmouth, N.H.; a grandson, Nicolas Weathersbee, of St. Petersburg, Fla.; and four great-grandchildren.         Just days before her death, Ms. Settle discussed her memorial service with Mr. Lawrence, her editor. In a conversation that inspired her to give an impromptu recitation of a Keats sonnet (''When I have fears that I may cease to be''), she told him that she would like to have the beginning of the Gospel of St. John read. ''If you're a writer, you can see the appeal of that text,'' Mr. Lawrence said.         The first words of the first verse of the Book of John are ''In the beginning was the word.''       
         Dr. Margot S. Kruskall, a Harvard hematologist and an expert on blood banks who was an early advocate for patients' donations of their own blood before surgery, a practice propelled by the spread of AIDS in the 1980's, died on Aug. 27 at her home in Dover, Mass. She was 56. The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         In 1982, when Dr. Kruskall headed Beth Israel Hospital's blood bank and hematology laboratory in Boston, she established a program for patients to donate and store their own blood, in large part stemming from concerns about hepatitis infections.         The practice, known as autologous donation, was known for more than a century, although it had never before been instituted on a wide scale. Dr. Kruskall and others at Beth Israel set up a system to label the blood, decided what surgical procedures were best served by it and created an inventory system.         The program's timing was propitious, coming just as H.I.V. was being recognized as a blood-borne virus.         When similar programs appeared nationwide, Dr. Kruskall and others analyzed their effectiveness and published the findings in the journal Transfusion in 1986. Autologous donations have since declined, largely because of closer controls on blood banks and the application of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells and markedly reduces the need for blood transfusions.         Dr. Justine M. Carr, a hematologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a former director of the hematology lab there, said Dr. Kruskall began to research the viability of erythropoietin in the 1980's, helping to prove its effectiveness and determine dosages.         She and other scientists later developed a blood test to detect erythropoietin, which has been used by athletes to reduce muscle fatigue and illicitly enhance performance.         More recently, Dr. Kruskall pursued research to develop a kind of universal red blood cell that could be safely infused, regardless of a patient's blood type. She worked with Type B blood, modifying its red cells with enzymes to react like the cells in blood Type O, which can be received by most patients.         Margot Sheffield Kruskall was born in New York City. She earned an undergraduate degree from Jackson College of Tufts University, and her medical degree from the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1974.         She arrived at Beth Israel in 1976 and remained for the rest of her career, ultimately serving as director of the division of laboratory and transfusion medicine. Harvard appointed her an associate professor of medicine in 1992 and a professor of pathology in 2002.         Dr. Kruskall was an associate editor of Transfusion.         She is survived by her husband of 32 years, Dr. Stephen Kruskall, co-chairman of the emergency room at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Mass.; a son, Peter; two daughters, Gillian and Lauren, all of Dover; and by a sister, Denni Day of Rochester.       
         Kathryn O. Scott, a pioneer in the meticulous art of textile conservation whose accomplishments included doing Napoleon's personal laundry, died on Oct. 15 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         Her death was confirmed by Mary Ballard, the senior textile conservator at the Smithsonian Center for Materials Research and Education and a former protégée. Ms. Scott leaves no immediate survivors.         Ms. Scott, who almost single-handedly created the field in the United States in the decades after World War II, was one of the country's most sought-after freelance textile conservators -- and not merely because she was for years the country's only freelance textile conservator. Among her clients were the Metropolitan Museum of Art; the Museum of Modern Art; the Smithsonian Institution; Colonial Williamsburg; Franklin D. Roosevelt's home in Hyde Park, N.Y.; Sagamore Hill, Theodore Roosevelt's home in Oyster Bay, N.Y.; and many private collectors.         From 1964 to 1990, she was adjunct professor of conservation at the Institute of Fine Arts of New York University.         Until the 1950's, museums wanting to restore a soiled or ripped textile typically resorted to a quick fix in which the damaged portion was patched or sheared away. But as anyone who has tried to iron a Qiana shirt knows, for any given textile, the wrong treatment can have disastrous consequences. For the conservator, antique textiles pose particular challenges.         ''The fibers are too fragile and they react differently,'' Ms. Ballard said in a telephone interview on Wednesday. ''You can't put them in the washing machine; you can't use normal detergents; you can't handle them or mount them the way you would a modern piece.''         Textile conservation is a job of clean hands and minute advances, where fabric is mended or re-embroidered or tenderly vacuumed through a screen a fraction of an inch at a sitting.         ''You don't jump in with both feet,'' Ms. Scott told a newspaper interviewer early in her career. ''You work on one-eighth of an inch at a time. Then, if you make a mistake on one-eighth of an inch, it can always be corrected.''         A textile can be a garment, of course, but it can also be a length of lace, a tapestry, a flag, a quilt or a doll, and a conservator must know how to handle all of these. Animal fibers like wool and silk behave differently from vegetable fibers like cotton and linen, and, confronted with a piece of old cloth, the conservator must first determine its composition. (One method is to set the piece on fire: different fibers give off characteristic odors when burned. Conservators discourage this.)         Textile conservators know things civilians do not, for instance, that the larvae of the clothes moth are fond of tomato-juice, beer and beef-gravy stains, while adult moths prefer the cholesterol in the ring around the collar of a wool jacket. At bibulous parties, conservators are called upon to salvage the tablecloth. (Blot gently with paper towel, then soak in white vinegar and a little clear dishwashing liquid.) All this knowledge Ms. Scott acquired, largely on her own.         Kathryn Olivia Scott, known as Kay, was born on Sept. 1, 1911, in Galesburg, Ill., and came to New York in the early 1930's. Hoping to be an artist, she studied at the Art Students League and later found work hand-painting linen neckties for John Wise, a textile dealer and collector. Shortly afterward, Mr. Wise left a box of pre-Columbian textile fragments on her doorstep with a request to preserve them.         There was nowhere to study textile conservation then, so Ms. Scott sought out archaeologists, textile scientists and museum curators and asked questions. It took her three years to restore the fragments, but by the time she finished, she had acquired a profession. She also acquired more dental and surgical tools than the average dentist or surgeon.         Ms. Scott was a master of pragmatic improvisation. In 1957 she had to replace a section of missing fringe on a 1,700-year-old Peruvian mantle owned by Herbert Hoover. The original fringe was made of twisted multicolored yarn. After having a chemical laboratory dye yarn exactly to match, Ms. Scott replicated the twist by spinning it with an electric drill.         To restore an upholstered Queen Anne chair for Colonial Williamsburg, she dyed white silk thread with coffee to mimic the natural aging of the original white embroidery.         In one of her most thrilling assignments, Ms. Scott was hired by a private collector to clean Napoleon's discolored white dress pants, vest and a nightshirt with French cuffs. She soaked the garments in a diluted solution of hydrogen peroxide, repeating the process 14 times until the discoloration was completely gone.         The project accorded Ms. Scott a title to which few can lay claim. ''You might say,'' she told an interviewer some time afterward, ''I was his laundress.''       
         Margretta Madden Styles, a nursing educator who conceived and helped establish precise national standards for certifying nurses in pediatrics, cardiology and other medical specialties, died on Nov. 20 at her home in Clearwater, Fla. She was 75.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         It was in the 1970's that Dr. Styles and others began to press for stricter certification of nurses and a rational system to regulate them. She lectured and wrote on the subject in nursing journals, contributing articles on advanced nursing practices and ways to determine criteria for issuing sound credentials.         In the 1980's she helped found the American Nurses Credentialing Center, which now administers testing for more than 20 medical specialties and, said Catherine L. Gilliss, dean of the Duke University School of Nursing, ''helped to standardize across the nation just what to expect from your nurse.''         The center is the credentialing arm of the American Nurses Association, which represents 150,000 nurses and nurse specialists. Dr. Styles served as the association's president from 1986 to 1988.         Later in her career she studied the emerging importance of trained nurses in developing countries and, in 1993, was elected president of the International Council of Nurses.         She continued to write on certification and helped edit a popular anthology, ''On Nursing: A Literary Celebration'' (1993), which ''framed the art of healing, the pain of suffering, and was received as a gift to the profession,'' said Barbara A. Blakeney, the current president of the American Nurses Association.         Margretta Madden was born in Mount Union, Pa., and earned an undergraduate degree from Juniata College, a master's from Yale and a doctorate in education from the University of Florida.         She worked as a staff nurse in hospitals before becoming an associate professor of nursing at Duke in 1967. She was dean of nursing at the University of Texas at San Antonio; then at Wayne State University, in Detroit; and finally at the University of California, San Francisco.         Dr. Styles's husband of 47 years, the Rev. Douglas Styles, an Episcopal priest, died in 2002.         She is survived by two sons, Michael, of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Patrick, of Redmond, Wash.; a daughter, Megan Styles of Danville, Calif.; a brother, Joseph Madden of Indian Rocks, Fla.; a sister, Jane Rupp of St. Petersburg; and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Aiken Littauer, whose love affair with horses began with a childhood pony, blossomed with her marriage to an officer in the cavalry of Czar Nicholas II, and flowered famously when she became a leading expert on horses of ancient times, died on Dec. 7 at her home in Syosset, N.Y. She was 93.         Her son, Andrew, announced the death.         Mrs. Littauer's scholarly career did not begin until her mid-50's, when her husband's health would no longer permit him to maintain his standards of horsemanship. The standards were high indeed: Vladimir S. Littauer was the author of eight books on riding and training horses, and his instructional techniques are still used.         Not wanting to ride alone, Mrs. Littauer was restless. Her husband suggested she write a book about horses.         She had had no college education, but decided to start at the beginning. By bringing her keen intelligence and considerable horse sense to archaeological discoveries, she would write about when and how horses and men got together. Her first article, ''The Function of the Yoke Saddle in Ancient Harnessing,'' appeared in the British journal Antiquity in 1968.         The same year, Mrs. Littauer was introduced to Joost Crouwel, who had just earned a degree in classical archaeology from the University of Amsterdam and was beginning his doctoral thesis on Mycenaean chariots. A collaboration of three decades began.         Dr. Crouwel became professor of Aegean archaeology at the University of Amsterdam. Mrs. Littauer gained fame as the Grande Dame of the study of horses.         The two wrote about 65 articles for academic journals, usually with each other though sometimes with other scholars and sometimes individually. A typical title: ''The Earliest Evidence for Metal Bridle Parts.''         They wrote two books, ''Wheeled Vehicles and Ridden Animals in the Ancient Near East'' (1970) and ''Chariots and Related Equipment from the Tomb of Tutankhamen'' (1985). Both became standard reference works.         ''They have set international standards that will last for many years,'' said Peter Raulvig, an archaeologist and linguist who also studied chariots.         In 2002, Mrs. Littauer and Dr. Crouwel published a collection titled ''Selected Writing on Chariots and Other Early Vehicles, Riding and Harness.''         An example of Mrs. Littauer's analysis was her article in 1983 in La Recherche, a French counterpart of Scientific American, in which she rejected earlier assertions that the first wheels were used on two-wheeled carts. Instead, she argued, the first real wheel was on a crude four-wheel vehicle. She theorized that soft sands in the Middle East would have made a two-wheeled precursor of the chariot impractical, and pointed to the four-wheeled carriages discovered by Sir Leonard Woolley in the so-called King's Tomb in Ur, a Sumerian city that flourished in Lower Mesopotamia (now Iraq) about 4,500 years ago.         But she disputed Sir Leonard's contention that the vehicles were the ''tanks'' of antiquity. The reason was that the harness used was highly vulnerable to projectiles, not to mention the vehicle's occupants, The New York Times reported in 1983.         Her ability to interpret evidence found by others became legendary. She once pointed out that an ancient horse's bit displayed in the British Museum was upside down. Embarrassed curators corrected the error.         Mary Aiken Graver was born in Pittsburgh on Feb. 11, 1912, and grew up in Manhattan. Her formal education ended when she graduated from what is now the Spence School. Her interest in horses dates from her ownership of a cow pony in Nevada, where her family vacationed.         As a young woman, she was a volunteer courier in the Frontier Nursing Service, which provided health care in rural Kentucky. For young society women, the chance to ride horses for many miles over roadless, mountainous terrain in a good cause was grand adventure. She was once caught in the middle of a shooting battle between feuding families.         Mr. Littauer founded a riding academy called the Boots and Saddles Club, and also taught private clients at the family's Long Island home before his death in 1989, at 96. In addition to their son, of Princeton, N.J., Mrs. Littauer is survived by two grandsons.         Already fluent in French, Mrs. Littauer taught herself ancient Greek, German and Russian. Scholars sent her their research results, commentaries and papers to edit.         Mary B. Moore, an art historian at Hunter College specializing in ancient Greece, said that Mrs. Littauer advised colleagues on how an ancient bit or bridle was probably used, or on where the driver would have stood on a chariot. Dr. Moore said those suggestions were utterly practical, and seldom theoretical or aesthetic.         She said that Mrs. Littauer seldom went to archaeological digs, because of her age. ''Sitting around a ditch all day wouldn't have been one of those things she would go for.''         She was nonetheless famously observant. In a paper on the Roman use of horses, Judith A. Walker, an archaeologist, mentioned a chariot and harness found in an ancient tomb.         ''No one person has spent more time studying, reconstructing and analyzing this harness and chariot than Mary Littauer,'' she wrote.         Mrs. Littauer embodied skepticism, as when what appeared to be wheels of chariots were found on the Russian steppes. In an article in The New York Times in 1994, she cautioned, ''A spoked wheel is not necessarily a chariot, only a light car on the way to becoming a chariot.''         On rare occasions, Mrs. Littauer ventured beyond the ancient world, with an interest as modern as the horses of medieval knights.       
         Margaret Hodges, who filled bookshelves with retold legends and other books for young readers and with the awards she received for them, died on Tuesday at her home in Verona, Pa. She was 94.         Her death was announced by her son Arthur C. Hodges, who said two more of her books were to be published in the future.         Her most recent illustrated books of familiar stories include ''Merlin and the Making of the King'' (Holiday House, 2004), ''The Wee Christmas Cabin'' (Holiday House, early 2007) and ''Moses'' (Harcourt Brace, January 2007).         Mrs. Hodges's other books still in print include ''The Wave'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1964), adapted from Lafcadio Hearn's ''Gleanings in Buddha-Fields;'' ''Saint George and the Dragon: A Golden Legend'' (Little, Brown, 1984), adapted from Spenser's ''Faerie Queen;'' ''The Kitchen Knight: A Tale of King Arthur'' (Holiday House, 1990); ''Saint Patrick and the Peddler'' (Orchard Books, 1993); ''Gulliver in Lilliput'' (Holiday House, 1995); ''Molly Limbo'' (Atheneum, 1996); and ''Up the Chimney'' (Holiday House, 1998).         She wrote more than 50 books over 47 years. She edited other work, especially travel books for young people, before writing her first book, ''One Little Drum'' (Follet Publishing Company, 1958). Aimed at children 6 to 9 years old, it was based on the exploits of her own three sons.         Mrs. Hodges also wrote biographies and novels for children and young adults.         She was born Sarah Margaret Moore on July 26, 1911, in Indianapolis and graduated from Vassar in 1932, the year she married Fletcher Hodges Jr., a museum curator. She also received a master's degree in library science in 1958 from the Carnegie Institute of Technology while working as a volunteer children's librarian at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. She later was a story specialist for the Pittsburgh Public Schools and joined the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences, from which she retired as a professor emerita in 1978.         While in Pittsburgh, she was a storyteller on the show ''Tell Me a Story'' on WQED-TV, a public television station, from the mid-1960's to 1976.         Mrs. Hodges earned numerous literary honors, including the Caldecott Medal of the American Library Association in 1985 for ''Saint George and the Dragon.''         Besides her husband of 73 years, and her son Arthur, of Essex, Mass., Mrs. Hodges is survived by two more sons, Fletcher III, of Manhattan, and John A., of Washington; 9 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.
