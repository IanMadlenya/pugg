         Dr. Francesca Morosani Thompson, a prominent orthopedic surgeon at Roosevelt  Hospital who chronicled her struggle against cancer of the bone marrow in a book, "Going for the Cure," died on Thursday at New York Hospital. A resident of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, she was 51.         She was a partner in Orthopaedic Associates of New York. Besides serving as an attending physician at Roosevelt, she was the chief of the Adult Orthopaedic  Foot Clinic of St. Luke's-Roosevelt Medical Center; a co-director of the Combined Foot and Ankle Fellowship at the Hospital for Special Surgery, and a clinical assistant professor of orthopedics at Columbia University's College of  Physicians and Surgeons.         Dr. Thompson was born in Litchfield, Conn., and graduated from Smith College in 1965. She took up her medical training after the birth of her two children and graduated from Cornell University Medical College in 1977. She was vice president of the American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society and a fellow of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery.         Her cancer of the bone marrow was diagnosed in 1987, when she became the first victim of multiple myeloma to undergo an autologous bone-marrow transplant. In that procedure, the patient's own bone marrow is withdrawn for radiation treatment and chemotherapy and put back into the body.         Her book, written for patients and their families, was published by St. Martin's Press in 1989. She donated the proceeds to a foundation she created for the purpose, the Cure Myeloma Fund. The International Myeloma Foundation, which supports research into the disease, issued a paperback reprint in 1993, and a Braille version remains in print as well.         Dr. Thompson is survived by her husband, James E.; a daughter, Heather R. Cavalli of Miami; a son, James E., also of Manhattan; her mother, Virginia W. Morosani of Litchfield; two sisters, Virginia Smith of Mill Neck, L.I., and Roopa Morosani of Menlo Park, Calif., and three brothers, George Morosani of Ashville, N.C., Reto Morosani of Litchfield and John Morosani of Manhattan.       
         Anna Mikhailovna Larina, the widow of Nikolai I. Bukharin, a father of the Bolshevik Revolution who was executed under Stalin, and herself a survivor of the Soviet gulag, died of lung cancer here on Saturday, her daughter, Nadezhda Fadeyeva, said. She was 82.         When Bukharin, a trusted comrade of Lenin and a rival to Stalin, was condemned in 1938 in the last of the Moscow show trials, his young wife was banished and spent 20 years in exile and Soviet prison camps. Before they were separated, Bukharin instructed his wife to memorize his final testament, in which he implored future generations of Communist leaders to exonerate him. Not  daring to write it down, she later recalled, she used to lull herself to sleep in prison by repeating her husband's words silently to herself "like a prayer."  It was not published in full until 1988.         Miss Larina's autobiography, "This I Cannot Forget," created a sensation when it was published in Russia in 1988 as part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rehabilitation of Bukharin. But long before, while she was still in exile, Miss  Larina waged a tireless campaign to exonerate her husband after Stalin's death,  writing long, detailed letters to Nikita Khrushchev and his successors demanding Bukharin's reinstatement in the pantheon of revolutionary heroes.         Miss Larina's book was an instant best-seller. A harrowing prison memoir as well as a loving, uncritical tribute to Bukharin, it is also one of the few first-person accounts of repression and prison life by a fallen member of the Bolshevik ruling elite. Miss Larina was the adopted daughter of a leading Communist revolutionary, Yuri Larin, and grew up in the Metropole Hotel, the residence of many Soviet leaders, dandled on the knee of Lenin. She had known Bukharin, who was 25 years older than she and a friend of her father's, all her  life. She was 16 when they became engaged -- Stalin hand-delivered her first love letter to Bukharin -- and 20 when they married.         She was 24 when she was sent into exile and separated from their infant son,  Yuri, whom she did not see again until he was 20. The boy was passed around by relatives and later raised in a state orphanage. He only learned who his father  was in 1956, when he was allowed to visit his mother in exile. She was released  in 1959, and returned to Moscow with her second husband, Fyodor Fadeyev, a fellow prisoner she met in Siberia, and their two children.         Stephen F. Cohen, a Princeton University historian who published a biography  of Bukharin in 1973, met clandestinely with the widow during the Brezhnev era and became a close friend, discovering in the archives and returning to her the  last love letter Bukharin wrote to her, on Jan. 15, 1938, from prison. He was shot two months later.         Mr. Cohen described Miss Larina as "the last living link to the generation that made the revolution." He added that it was her remarkable personality that  cemented their friendship. "She lost everything," Mr. Cohen said, "but she showed no bitterness. She endured this horrible experience but it didn't deform  her psychologically. In 1988, she was able to resume public life in a way that astonished people."         After winning the campaign to rehabilitate her husband, Miss Larina devoted her last years to trying to recover Bukharin's long-hidden prison writings, philosophical essays, poems and also an autobiographical novel, which were unearthed from secret party archives in 1992. The novel is scheduled to be published in English by Columbia University Press later this year.         In addition to her daughter and her son Yuri Larin, Miss Larina is survived by her second son, Mikhail Fadeyev.       
         Sharman Douglas, a socialite whose life was defined by her friendship as a youth with Princess Margaret and her ensuing lifelong friendship with Britain's  royal family, died on Saturday at New York Hospital. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan.         John S. Zinsser Jr., a cousin, said she died of bone cancer.         Miss Douglas first burst into the news as a teen-ager when her father, Lewis W. Douglas, was appointed Ambassador to the Court of St. James in 1947. She quickly became a close friend of Princess Margaret, and her parties in the official residence attracted the cream of young London glitterati. At a party in 1949, at which she was the host, the present Queen, who was then Princess Elizabeth, arrived dressed as an Edwardian parlor maid, Prince Philip as a waiter and Princess Margaret as a can-can girl, replete with lace panties and black stockings.         Miss Douglas attended the Brearley School and left Vassar to accompany her parents to England. When the family returned to the United States in 1950, she made her home in New York. She did a stint at booking talent for the "Tonight" show and briefly worked in the publicity field for movie studios. In 1966, after the election of John V. Lindsay as Mayor, she joined the city's Public Events Department. She later formed Sass, a public relations company that specialized in charitable benefits and in British accounts.         "She loved people and she was fun," said Mary Lindsay, the wife of Mr. Lindsay and a longtime friend.         Throughout her life she was a social figure on both coasts and in England. She was a guest at the 1991 banquet in Washington given by Queen Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh in honor of President and Mrs. Bush, and entertained Princess Margaret and Prince Philip during their visits. She was particularly visible at social events that related to England, such as a celebratory party for Queen Elizabeth's birthday, where she joined other social figures like Steven and Kimberly Rockefeller and Jean MacArthur.         Miss Douglas's father, who before his appointment as Ambassador was a three-term Democratic Congressman from Arizona and budget director for President Franklin D. Roosevelt, was the son of James Stuart Douglas, the owner of copper  mines in Arizona. Her mother, Peggy Zinsser Douglas, was a descendant of the family that founded the Zinsser Chemical Company.         Miss Douglas was married in 1968 to Andrew Hay, an importer. They divorced in 1977. She is survived by her brothers, Lewis W. Douglas Jr., of Denver, and James Stuart Douglas of Tucson.       
         Isabel Kambert, an opera singer who escaped Nazi Germany with liverwurst sandwiches stuffed with folded 10,000-mark notes, and who later in New York became known as Mme. Isabel after creating the fashion for decorated cashmere sweaters, died on Wednesday at the home of a niece, Eva Ballantine, in Kingston, N.Y.         Mrs. Kambert was 103.         She was well known in German and Paris opera houses in the 1930's until, unwilling to join the Nazi party, she was banned from performing. She left Germany in 1938 on an overnight train to Paris, carrying one small bag and a box of tiny sandwiches.         She often told friends that at the border, flirtatious guards asked if they could have one of her sandwiches, and when they persisted, she fended them off with: "Oh, no, you wouldn't want one of these. They're kosher." The sandwiches apparently lost their appeal.         When she reached New York shortly after, suitable opera roles were in short supply and she took a job for a time decorating cashmere sweaters, using embroidery, beading or ribbons as embellishment. The shop was run by three Russian emigres: Karinska, who later became known for her ballet costumes; Princess Natasha Paley, and Baron Nicholas de Gunzberg, who went on to senior editorial positions at Harper's Bazaar and Vogue magazines.         Mrs. Kambert later opened her own business as part of the custom house of Chez Ninon and, for a brief period, was associated with Saks Fifth Avenue. In the 1960's, she operated independently in the Lombardy Hotel.         Her customers included Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother, who bought a sweater during a visit to New York, Alice Roosevelt Longworth, Doris Duke, the Duchess of Windsor and Greta Garbo.         One of eight children of Hugo Heermann, a German violinist who was discovered by Rossini at age 9 and who introduced several Brahms compositions, Mrs. Kambert was born in Frankfurt in 1892. She was married and widowed four times.       
         Marie-Helene de Rothschild, one of Europe's most imaginative hostesses, whose activities were a major part of the Paris social season for many years, died on  Friday at her home in Ferrieres, 20 miles northeast of Paris. She was 65 and had suffered for three decades from an incurable degenerative arthritic ailment.         Baroness de Rothschild, whose husband, Baron Guy de Rothschild, is dean of the French branch of the banking family, was well known in the world of fashion  and was particularly renowned for the dinners, balls and benefits she organized. Many were held at Chateau Ferrieres, the former Rothschild mansion that now belongs to the French state. The house in which the Baroness died was built on the estate after the chateau had been given to the Government.         The Baroness, who enjoyed creating fantasies for her social occasions, once  greeted 150 guests at a dinner (Diner de Tetes Surrealistes, whose invitations had to be read in a mirror) dressed as a stag at the kill, with a mask of towering antlers and pear-shaped diamond "tears" on her face.         At a ball she gave at Ferrieres for 1,600 people, the chateau was covered in  white muslin to make it look like a huge diamond-studded cobweb. A gala for the  Paris Ballet transformed the Palais Garnier into a woodland, with trees and vines climbing to the ceiling. At another function, her Bal Proust, celebrating  the 100th anniversary of Marcel Proust's birth, Cecil Beaton took guests' photographic portraits.         "When she has made up her mind about something, there is nothing on earth that can deter her," her husband once said.         The daughter of Baron Egmont van Zuylen de Nyevelt de Haar, a Dutch diplomat, and an Egyptian mother, the Baroness was educated at Marymount College in New York.         On a trip to Paris shortly after leaving school, she met and married Count Francois de Nicolay. They were divorced six years later after she had met Baron  de Rothschild and he, too, had decided to obtain a divorce. The Rothschilds were married in 1957 in a civil ceremony in New York -- "to allow the tempest we had  stirred up by a double divorce to subside a little," the Baroness once recalled.         After Ferrieres was donated to the Government, the Baroness did most of her entertaining at her Paris residence, the 18th-century Hotel Lambert on Ile St.-Louis. Her guests included a cross-section of international society, business and the arts -- the Duchess of Windsor, Princess Grace, Elizabeth Taylor, Yves Saint Laurent, Oscar de la Renta and Andy Warhol.         "A good way of making people happy is to allow them to meet their opposites," she once said.         Nan Kempner, a New York socialite and a longtime friend, said, "She had enormous intelligence and curiosity and she wanted to see and do everything."         When France nationalized Banque Rothschild in 1981, the Baron moved to New York for a short time. Although the Baroness's illness made traveling difficult, she worked with an interior decorator on refurbishing their Upper East Side apartment.         The Baroness was also a major supporter of French couture and for many years  was in the front row at important shows. She was president of the committee that organized the 1973 Divertissement a Versailles, an event at which American designers were not only introduced to Europeans but also upstaged their French counterparts.         Survivors include her husband; two sons, Philippe de Nicolay, and Edouard de  Rothschild of Paris; a stepson, David de Rothschild of Paris, and a brother, Teddy van Zuylen of London.       
         Virginia Henderson, who took a temporary job caring for World War I wounded and ended up helping to elevate nursing into a respected independent profession  as a renowned researcher, teacher and scholar, died on Tuesday at a hospice in Branford, Conn. Known as the mother of modern nursing, she was 98.         Her own experiences in taking care of patients for the Army in Washington, and later as a public health nurse there and in New York in the 1920's, informed and inspired her work. But it was as an educator and researcher, first at Teachers College of Columbia University in the 1930's and 40's and after 1953, at the Yale School of Nursing, that Miss Henderson made her greatest contributions to a long-scorned profession.         To hear Miss Henderson tell it, a chief concern of hospital nurses when she  started was to keep their formidable starched white uniforms wrinkle-free.         It was an era not far removed from when nurses were regarded as at best glorified domestics filling in for female relatives caring for home-bound patients (and paid somewhere between cooks and seamstresses). At worst, they were regarded as the dregs of a society that expected prostitutes and other female outcasts recovering from illnesses to care for sicker patients in the almshouses that were the forerunners of modern hospitals.         After all, the definition of an untrained nurse as someone "too old, too weak, too drunken, too dirty, too stolid or too bad to do anything else," had been provided by Florence Nightingale herself.         Miss Henderson was born in Kansas City, Mo., named for her mother's native state and later educated there at a boys' school run by her grandfather. By the  time she was propelled by patriotic fervor to enroll in the Army Nursing School  at the Walter Reed Hospital in Washington, training programs spurred by Nightingale's preachings had helped. But nurses were still largely regarded as the handmaidens of the physicians they assisted rather than independent professionals.         Miss Henderson, who had initially planned to switch professions after two years, helped remedy that view of nurses in part through exhaustive research that helped establish the scholarly underpinnings of her profession.         Beginning in 1939, she was the author of three editions of "Principles and Practices of Nursing," a widely used text, and her "Basic Principles of Nursing," published in 1966 and revised in 1972, has been published in 27 languages by the International Council of Nurses.         Her most formidable achievement was a 19-year research project in which she gathered, reviewed, catalogued, classified and cross-referenced every known piece of research on nursing published in English, resulting in the five-volume  "Nursing Research: Survey and Assessment," written with Leo Simmons and published in 1964, and her four-volume "Nursing Studies Index," completed in 1972.         It was a tribute to her work that in creating the first nursing library, the  nursing society Sigma Theta Tau International named it the Virginia Henderson International Nursing Library. The library, in Indianapolis, has been available  in electronic form through the Internet since 1994.         Curiously, while Miss Henderson consistently stressed nursing's duty to the patient rather than to the doctor, her efforts to provide a scientific basis for nursing, including creating the universally used system of recording observations of the patient, have helped make nurses far more valuable to doctors.         Still, Miss Henderson, who lobbied hard for a system of universal health care, was well aware that the largely female nursing profession had not reached  the level of acceptance that doctors enjoy.         In 1985, when she received the first Christiane Reimann prize from the International Nursing Council, nursing's highest honor, she noted scornfully that diagnoses made by experienced, trained nurses were still not being accorded the medical weight of those made by physicians.         "You know what M.D. stands for," she said. "Minor Deity."         Miss Henderson is survived by a sister, Frances Houff of Lynchburg, Va., a nephew, four nieces and several great-nieces and nephews.       
         Lola Beltran, the soulful Mexican singer whose achingly emotional renditions  of mariachi ballads made her known as Lola the Great to generations of Latin Americans, died on Sunday night in Mexico City. During a career that spanned five decades, she made a point of refusing to discuss her age, but she was believed to be in her mid-60's.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Maria Elena Leal, said in newspaper reports.         Among Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, Lola la Grande was held in high esteem for her ability to capture and reproduce in her music what they consider the melancholy essence of life. Song after song found her confronting suffering, loneliness, abandonment or loss with an equanimity that her millions of listeners in the Spanish-speaking world found inspiring and deeply moving.         In a tribute to Ms. Beltran written in 1994, the Mexican novelist Carlos Fuentes declared that "passion and desire, joy and risk, tenderness and the cry  for existence are the wings of this dove that is the voice of our lady Lola Beltran." Like most Mexicans, he added, "I have spent my life living and writing and loving and traveling with the voice of Lola Beltran close to me, on records, over the airwaves, but above all in the soundtrack of memory."         Ms. Beltran suffered a heart attack on March 16 and had been hospitalized, but she vowed to keep singing "as long as the body holds up." Revived by doctors after her heart had stopped beating for a reported seven minutes, she remarked,  "I fought death with all my might, and God in His infinite compassion has let me live for a little while longer."         Though Ms. Beltran's devotees ranged from presidents to peasants, she was especially admired by her fellow musicians. Her remarkable sense of phrasing, inflection and drama influenced a whole generation of younger vocalists, both men and women, inside and out of Mexico.         "Singers don't come any more real than Lola Beltran," Linda Ronstadt said in  1988 after releasing an album that included several songs associated with Ms. Beltran. "She's a world-class singer, up there rubbing shoulders with Billie Holiday and Edith Piaf."         In both her private and professional life, Ms. Beltran played the role of diva to the hilt. She dressed extravagantly, was fond of furs and ornate jewels  and relished the deference her admirers showered on her. She consequently earned a second nickname, "La Reina," or "The Queen."         Onstage, whether performing for Mexican immigrants at county fairs in Texas or at state dinners for Dwight D. Eisenhower, Charles de Gaulle or the King of Spain, her bearing was indeed regal. She would halt her orchestra in mid-measure with an authoritative wave of the hand, or in moments of great emotion clutch the rebozo, or shawl, that was her trademark.         Her origins, however, were modest. Maria Lucila Beltran was born in the northwestern Mexican state of Sinaloa, where her father, Pedro Beltran, was a mine manager. Her mother, a housewife who liked to sing around the house, exposed her daughter both to the hits of the day and older standards.         In her early years, Ms. Beltran sang at family gatherings or to the Carmelite nuns who educated her. But in 1953, with her mother, Maria de los Angeles Ruiz,  in tow as her chaperone, Ms. Beltran moved to Mexico City with hopes of entering show business. She took a secretarial job at XEW, a radio station known throughout Mexico as the home of the Mariachi Vargas, the most popular group of  the genre.         Ms. Beltran later would tell how she pestered the group until they gave her a chance to show off her vocal skills. The purity of her voice and her masterly technique immediately won them over, and within a year she was the star of her own program and the most popular female mariachi singer in Mexico. "Even now, every time I go by the station, I make the sign of the cross," she said in a 1988 interview, as a gesture of gratitude for good fortune.         Through the Mariachi Vargas, Ms. Beltran also met Tomas Mendez, the songwriter who would go on to compose many of her most successful songs. Several of those numbers, "Cucurrucucu Paloma" and "Tres Dias" in particular, became hits everywhere -- the United States included -- and made Ms. Beltran a star throughout the Spanish-speaking world.         "When I hear a song, I want it to tell me something," Ms. Beltran said in the same interview. "It can tell the story of a great love or of a tremendous sadness, but it has to have emotion and truth. The song has to make it worth my  while to sing it."         Though many of Ms. Beltran's contemporaries have long since faded from the scene, she maintained her appeal among those who consider themselves hip and contemporary. The Spanish film director Pedro Almodovar, for instance, used Ms.  Beltran's version of "Soy Infeliz," or "I Am Unhappy," as the opening theme of his 1988 hit, "Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown."         All told, Ms. Beltran recorded more than 100 albums, with total sales estimated in the tens of millions. She also appeared in more than 50 movies, most of them Mexican musicals of indifferent quality that owed their commercial  success to her remarkable popularity and her dark, keening voice.         Ms. Beltran is survived by her daughter, born of her marriage to the bullfighter and actor Alfredo Leal.       
         Mary Lavin, whose short stories and novels about the conflicts in the hearts  of her fellow Irish men and women transcended mere tales of life in Ireland, died on Monday at a nursing home here. She was 83.         Ms. Lavin was the author of 19 collections of short stories and three novels. She won three Guggenheim Fellowships and a number of literary awards, including  the Katherine Mansfield Prize, in 1961. Her stories appeared regularly in The New Yorker.         Her death was front-page news in The Irish Times, whose chief book critic, Eileen Battersby, called her "one of modern Irish fiction's most subversive voices" and said, "Her art explored often brutal tensions, disappointments and frustrations dictating the relationships within so-called 'normal' families."         Ms. Lavin's favorite form was the short story, which she once likened to "a flash of lightning lighting up the whole landscape all at once." In a 1976 interview she was quoted as saying: "Publishers are definitely unfair to short-story writers. Since the essence of the short story is its conciseness, an addiction to change is an occupational disease and not the self-indulgence publishers think." She also said: "I don't think a story has to have a beginning, middle and end. I think of it more as an arrow in flight."         Critics often compared Ms. Lavin's work to that of other acclaimed Irish writers, including Liam O'Flaherty and Sean O'Faolain, and also perceived echoes of Balzac, Chekhov and Saki. Her writing influenced the work of others, as well, including the novelist William Trevor.         Ms. Lavin said her childhood reading of Jane Austen influenced her writing. She said that, as a realist, her writing was "only looking closer than normal into the human heart, whose vagaries and contrarieties have their own integral design." In an appreciation in The Irish Times, Maurice Harmon, professor emeritus of Anglo-Irish Literature at University College in Dublin, wrote: "She  drew upon her own experience. Her stories explore and reflect the patterns of her life: the return of the little girl from America to the strange, puritanical society of her mother's people" in Western Ireland.         "At the high point of her career," he continued, "she wrote about widows who  refuse to be passive in the face of death, who keep their memories of love and go forth to encounter experience with openness and with the wisdom of years."         Mary Lavin was born on June 11, 1912, of immigrant parents in East Walpole, Mass. When she was 10 the family moved back to Athenry, in Western Ireland. She  wrote her first short story in 1938. Her first collection, "Tales From Bective Bridge," won the James Tate Black Memorial Prize in 1942 and helped establish her career.         Her short-story collections include "The Long Ago" (1944), "The Becker Wives" (1946), "A Single Lady" (1957), "In the Middle of the Fields" (1966) and "The Shrine and Other Stories" (1976). She published her first novel, "The House in Clewe Street," in 1945; her second, "Mary O'Grady," appeared in 1950.         She served as president of the Irish Academy of Letters in 1971.         Ms. Lavin's first marriage was to William Walsh, a lawyer, who died in 1954.  They had three daughters, who survive. In 1969 she married Michael McDonald Scott, a former Roman Catholic priest, who died in 1990. In recent years her health failed and she lived in a nursing home.         Her stories were characterized by arresting opening and closing lines. One story, "Happiness," begins with "Mother had a lot to say" and ends: "Mother made the last effort of her life and grasped at Bea's meaning. She let out a sigh, and, closing her eyes, she sank back, and this time her head sank so deep into the pillow that it would have been dented had it been a pillow of stone." Another, "A Memory," begins, "James did all right for a man on his own," and ends, "Under a weight of bitterness too great to be borne, his face was pressed  into the wet leaves and, when he gulped for breath, the rotted leaves were sucked into his mouth."       
         Helen Bunce, who knitted so many mittens she didn't know what to do unless she was knitting more mittens, died on Feb. 24 at a nursing home in Watertown, N.Y., where she was known as the Mitten Lady. She was 86 and had been knitting mittens until a few days before her death.         Mrs. Bunce had been a legend in Watertown and in international church circles for decades, although until December only a few people knew she was the Mitten Lady whose anonymous handmade donations to an annual church clothing drive had spread her fame far and wide.         Since 1948, when the third-grade Sunday school class at the Emmanuel Congregational Church in Watertown established a special Christmas tree to collect clothing for poor children, Mrs. Bunce had spent every otherwise spare moment knitting away.         "She could knit in her sleep," her daughter, Helen McDonald, said yesterday,  estimating that her mother had knitted at least 4,000 pairs of mittens over the  last 47 years, and probably a lot more.         "She didn't keep records in the early years," Mrs. McDonald said, "but some years she did more than 200."         For all the mittens she turned out, the Mitten Lady sobriquet was somewhat misleading. Mrs. Bunce, who knew that little heads as well as hands needed protection against the cold, knitted a matching cap for every pair of mittens and also turned out scarves.         The sets, which included a handwritten tag saying "God Loves You, and So Do I," were distributed to various churches and charities in Watertown and through  Church World Service, the Protestant relief agency, to poor children across the  nation and abroad.         As word of Mrs. Bunce's work spread, people across the country began sending  her yarn in care of the church, and she kept a scrapbook of thank-you notes from children she had helped and photographs showing some of them wearing her handiwork. Like the donated packages of yarn, the notes, addressed simply to the Mitten Lady, were delivered to the church and then passed on to her.         Mrs. Bunce, who lived in Watertown most of her life, carried her knitting wherever she went, clicking away whenever she found a spare moment. Her mittens, which always included two contrasting colors in striking designs, came in three  sizes, with the colors becoming darker as the sizes increased.         Although she suffered from osteoporosis so painful that she found it difficult to sit in a wheelchair in her last months, Mrs. Bunce, who had taught  herself to knit lying down after entering the nursing home, insisted on being taken to the church in December to make her usual surreptitious donation of her  year's production.         This time her cover was blown. She was introduced to the congregation as the  Mitten Lady, and the woman who had once explained that she labored anonymously because the purpose of her work was to help poor children and not to have people say, "Oh, that's wonderful," had to endure a five-minute ovation.         Then she went back to the nursing home and continued her knitting. Mrs. Bunce, who always made it a point to start a new pair of mittens or a cap as soon as one was completed (on the assumption, she once explained, that God would not let anything happen to her as long as she had unfinished work), apparently knew the end was near. When she died, her daughter said, her needles were empty.         Mrs. Bunce's husband of 67 years, Karl, died on Feb. 27. In addition to her daughter, of Alexandria Bay, N.Y., she is survived by two sons, Roy, of Strasbourg, France, and Jack, of Watertown; 11 grandchildren, and 10 great-grandchildren.       
         Marguerite Duras, author of the best-selling novel "The Lover" and one of the most widely read French writers of the postwar era, died today at her home in Paris. She was 81.         Miss Duras, who was also a prolific playwright, film maker and screenwriter,  was best known for the way she used her early life in French Indochina as the inspiration for many of her works, including "The Lover," the story of her clandestine teen-age romance with a wealthy young Chinese man. Yet perhaps what  most characterized her 53-year literary career was her simple, terse writing style, as if language itself were merely a vehicle for conveying passion and desire, pain and despair. The mysteries of love and sex consumed her, but she had no room for sentimentality in her works, or indeed, in her life.         I write about love, yes, but not about tenderness," she said in a 1990 interview. "I don't like tender people. I myself am very harsh. When I love someone, I desire them. But tenderness supposes the exclusion of desire." Ever provocative in her use of language, she always bowed to the supremacy of words.  "Acting doesn't bring anything to a text," Miss Duras wrote of her work for cinema and theater. "On the contrary, it detracts from it -- lessens its immediacy and depth, weakens its muscles and dilutes its blood."         In the theater, this seemed to matter little, and her plays continue to be performed regularly in France. However, despite the enormous success of her screenplay for Alain Resnais's 1960 classic, "Hiroshima, Mon Amour," few of the  19 movies she wrote and directed herself did well, not least because words often entirely replaced action. Until her 70th birthday, her novels had a loyal  albeit small readership. With the publication of "The Lover" in 1984, however, Miss Duras reached a mass audience in France and abroad. The book sold more than two million copies and was made into a well-received film in 1992 by Jean-Jacques Annaud.         Because she considered her words to be sacrosanct, she often had stormy dealings with movie directors who adapted her novels, among them Peter Brook, Tony Richardson and Jules Dassin. And when Mr. Annaud altered her screenplay for "The Lover," Miss Duras broke with him and turned her text into yet another semi-autobiographical novel, "The Lover From Northern China." She described that book, published in 1991, as a "reappropriation" of "The Lover," yet once again she seemed to be reinventing her life to a point where it became impossible to know whether her original novel, Mr. Annaud's film or her second version of the  story was the closest to reality. To Miss Duras, of course, this did not matter.         She was born on April 4, 1914, in Gia Dinh, near Saigon. Her parents, Henri and Marie Donnadieu (she changed her name to Duras in the 1930's), were teachers in France's colonial service. She was only a child when her father died, and her first memories were of economic hardship, above all after her mother invested the family's savings in a disastrous rice-farming venture.         After attending school in Saigon, Miss Duras moved to France at the age of 18 to study law and political science. After graduation, she worked as a secretary  in the French Ministry of the Colonies until 1941, but by then Nazi Germany had  occupied France. In 1943, she joined the Resistance in a small group that included Francois Mitterrand, who remained a friend until his recent death.         In 1939, Miss Duras married the writer Robert Antelme, who was arrested and deported to Germany during the war. By the time he returned from Dachau concentration camp in 1945 (he was the subject of her 1985 book "La Douleur," later published in the United States as "The War"), she was already involved with Dionys Mascolo, who was to become her second husband and with whom she had  a son, Jean.         In the late 1940's, Miss Duras joined the French Communist Party, and though  she later resigned, she always described herself a Marxist. Yet perhaps her strongest political stance was her contempt for Gen. Charles de Gaulle. "He never pronounced the word Jew after the war," she said in the 1990 interview. "Many people think I am Jewish, and that always pleases me."         Her first book, "Les Impudents," was published in 1943, and from that time, she lived off her writing, gradually building a body of work that included more than 70 novels, plays, screenplays and adaptations. She eventually acquired a country home in Normandy, but her book-lined Left Bank apartment on the Rue St.-Benoit remained her Paris home from 1942 until her death.         For many years, she struggled with alcoholism -- a subject she frequently addressed in her writings -- and her health was further shattered by emphysema.  But in the 1980's, long separated from Mr. Mascolo, she also found love again in an unusual relationship with a young homosexual writer, Yann Andrea Steiner, with whom she shared her final years.         Late last year, struggling again with illness, Miss Duras published "That's All," a tiny 54-page book that seemed intended to be her literary adieu to her readers, to Mr. Steiner and to herself. Written between November 1994 and last August, with each occasional entry carrying a date, it consisted of poetic bursts of love, fear and despair, as if all too aware that her death was near.         The very last entry, on the afternoon of Aug. 1, 1995, read:         "I think it is all over. That my life is finished.         "I am no longer anything.         "I have become an appalling sight.         "I am falling apart.         "Come quickly.         "I no longer have a mouth, no longer a face."         She is survived by her son and Mr. Steiner.       
         Minnie Pearl, the raucously funny radio, television and stage personality who was known as the queen of country comedy, died yesterday at a hospital in Nashville. She was 83.         No cause of death was immediately given, but Miss Pearl had been admitted to  the hospital nine days ago because of what was described as "a brain seizure or  stroke." She had given up performing in 1991 after suffering a stroke.         In the 1930's, Miss Pearl, whose real name was Sarah Cannon, created her classic backwoods character, Cousin Minnie Pearl, a wisecracking storyteller who wore a flowered straw hat with its $1.98 price tag attached and a thrift-shop cotton-print dress. The character was famous for her signature greeting, a high-pitched "How-dee! I'm just proud to be here!" and for her exuberant chatter about "ketchin' a feller."         A mainstay of "The Grand Ole Opry" for more than 50 years, Miss Pearl's monologues were built around strings of hoary jokes so corny they would make an  audience groan if told by anybody else. The jokes were often depicted as true events from the fictional rural town of Grinder's Switch. This technique of incorporating old jokes into supposedly "true" vignettes was later adapted by the monologuist Garrison Keillor to create the news and gossip he reported from  his fictional hometown, Lake Wobegon, Minn.         In real life, however, Miss Pearl was not the archetypal hayseed she portrayed for decades. Born in Centerville, Tenn., Sarah Ophelia Colley was the daughter of a well-to-do businessman in the lumber industry. As a girl, she  was only dimly aware of country music. Her mother, known as Aunt Fannie Collie,  played the organ in a local church. Miss Pearl, who aspired to be an actress and dancer, attended Ward-Belmont College, a fashionable finishing school in Nashville.         After graduation, she taught dance for a short time before being hired as a drama coach for the Wayne P. Sewall Producing Company, a small Atlanta theatrical organization that sent directors into small Southern towns to stage amateur productions in local schools. She found the model for her stage character in Baileyton, Ala., when she stayed with a family whose grande dame regaled the company with humorous tall tales.         "To help publicize the show in each town," she later recalled, "I would appear before the Lion's Club and other groups. In return for letting me announce my show, I'd do a couple of minutes' entertainment for them. I'd do an  interpretation of a country girl, Minnie Pearl."         When her father died, Miss Pearl settled in Centerville to take care of her ailing mother. At a meeting of local bankers, she revived her character and dreamed up the town of Grinder's Switch, which was actually the name of a railroad crossing three miles from her hometown.         At the meeting it was suggested that she audition for "The Grand Ole Opry." Because the producers worried that some listeners might find her hayseed character offensive, her first performance, for which she was paid $10, took place after 11 P.M.  Miss Pearl quickly became one of the show's most popular performers, and in 1940 she was made a permanent member of the Opry, remaining until 1991 when the stroke she suffered at the time left her partially paralyzed.         When Miss Pearl was 34, she married Henry Cannon, a pilot who managed her career and flew her and her co-workers to their many shows. Over the years, Miss Pearl toured with most of the leading country-music stars and appeared at Carnegie Hall in 1947. She was named Nashville's Woman of the Year in 1965 and inducted into the Country Music Hall of Fame in 1975. She recorded albums for several labels and in 1966 had a top-10 country single, "Giddyup -- Go Answer."         Discussing her alter ego, Miss Pearl once said, "Minnie Pearl is uncomplicated. She's apple pie and clothes dried in the sun and the smell of fresh bread baking. I don't think people think of her so much as a show business act as a friend. When I'm on stage, I'm just plain Minnie Pearl wearing my battered old straw hat and battered shoes. The price tag on my hat seems to be symbolic of all human frailty. There's old Minnie Pearl standing on stage in her best dress, telling everyone how proud she is to be there."

         Erma Bombeck, who mined the everyday lives of housewives and parents for the  mother lode of humor that transformed her into one of the country's most popular newspaper columnists and a best-selling author, died yesterday at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center. Mrs. Bombeck, who made her home in Paradise Valley, Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix, was 69.         Mrs. Bombeck, afflicted for years with polycystic kidney disease, a hereditary ailment, underwent a kidney transplant this month at the hospital, which said she died of complications after the surgery.         Three times a week until about two years ago, and more recently on a twice-weekly schedule, Mrs. Bombeck did what she had done since 1964: sifted greasy ovens, voracious washing machines, sibling rivalry and the predilections  of couch-potato spouses for the nuggets of mirth that won her the devotion of readers who followed her 500- to 600-word columns in some 600 newspapers.         "My type of humor is almost pure identification," she said. "A housewife reads my column and says, 'But that's happened to me! I know just what she's talking about!' "         Fans appreciated Mrs. Bombeck's slapstick approach to housekeeping and family relations.         *Dirty ovens: "If it won't catch fire today, clean it tomorrow."         *The dilemmas of sibling rivalry: "Who gets the fruit cocktail with the lone  cherry on top?"         *Affairs: "If a woman is ever to have an affair, it will be in March. Psychologically, it is a perfect month. The bowling tournaments are over. The white sales on bedding are past. Your chest cold has stabilized and the Avon lady is beginning to look like Tom Jones."         *Male habits: "If a man watches 16 consecutive quarters of football, he can be declared legally dead."         *Housework: "My second favorite household chore is ironing. My first being hitting my head on the top bunk bed until I faint."         *Teen-agers: "Don't ever say you understand them. It breaks down the hostile  relationship between you that it takes to understand one another."         Even at the pinnacle of success, earning $500,000 to $1 million a year, Mrs.  Bombeck made cleaning house, grocery shopping and cooking dinner a part of her weekly routine. "If I didn't do my own housework, then I have no business writing about it," she said. "I spend 90 percent of my time living scripts and 10 percent writing them."         Besides her columns, distributed at the time of her death by the Universal Press Syndicate in Kansas City, Mo., Mrs. Bombeck was the author of more than a  dozen books, including popular successes with titles like "The Grass Is Always Greener Over the Septic Tank" (1976), "If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I  Doing in the Pits?" (1978) and "Motherhood: The Second Oldest Profession" (1983).         From 1975 to 1986 she appeared twice a week on "Good Morning America" on the  ABC network. At various times, she wrote a monthly column for Good Housekeeping, contributed to magazines like Reader's Digest, Family Circle, Redbook and McCall's; lectured; created, wrote and produced the short-lived 1981 ABC television series "Maggie" and saw "The Grass Is Always Greener" turned into a 1978 prime-time CBS television movie starring Carol Burnett as a concerned mother who was Mrs. Bombeck's alter ego and Charles Grodin as her husband.         In 1988, after her previous five books had sold more than 15 million copies,  she signed a three-book contract with Harper & Row valued by publishing experts  at $12 million.         Mrs. Bombeck was a housewife and mother, living outside Dayton in Centerville, Ohio, and advancing toward 40 when she determined to change her life.         "That's when I used to sit at the kitchen window, year after year, watching women like Ruth Gordon, Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Golda Meir carving out their own careers," she said. "I decided that it wasn't fulfilling to clean chrome faucets with a toothbrush. At 37, I decided it was my time to strike out.         In 1964, after the last of her three children started school, she began writing columns. She was, she said, "too old for a paper route, too young for Social Security and too tired for an affair."         Erma Louise Fiste was born Feb. 21, 1927, in Dayton. When she was 9, her father, a crane operator named Cassius Fiste, died of a heart attack at 42. "One day you were a family, living in a little house at the bottom of a hill," she said. "The next day it was all gone."         Mrs. Bombeck, who began writing a humor column at Emerson Junior High in Dayton, worked as a copy girl for The Dayton Journal-Herald after graduating from high school in 1944. She became a reporter there after graduating from the  University of Dayton with a bachelor of arts degree in 1949, the same year she married William Bombeck, a sportswriter who became a high school principal.         Mrs. Bombeck said she chose the subject of her columns because "being a housewife was the only thing in life I could discuss for more than 10 minutes."         She persuaded Ron Ginger, the editor of The Kettering-Oakwood Times, a suburban weekly, to pay her $3 a column, and she was on her way.         In 1992, Mrs. Bombeck underwent a mastectomy after cancer was diagnosed in a  breast, and not long afterward, as her kidneys failed, she began undergoing dialysis at her home.         In addition to her husband, who lives in Paradise Valley, and her mother, Erma Harris, of Sun City, Ariz., Mrs. Bombeck is survived by her three children: Betsy and Andrew, of Phoenix and Matthew, of Los Angeles.       
         Molly Keane, an Anglo-Irish novelist who had ridden to enough hounds, attended enough hunt balls and listened to enough below-stairs gossip by the time she was 17 to sustain two literary careers three decades apart, died on Monday at her cliffside home in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland. She was 91.         Although she was best known for her novel "Good Behavior," a finalist for the 1981 Booker Prize, its publication represented the resumption of a career she had abandoned after the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier.         It was a career that had been born and remained grounded in her childhood experiences.         Growing up in a grand home in County Wexford, where her Protestant English father was a noted fox hunter and her Irish mother was a lapsed poet and Italian literary scholar who wrote occasional reviews, was not entirely pleasant for Mrs. Kean.         But although her own sister once described her as an unloved child, her childhood served her well, providing the swirling fox-hunting background and social intrigue she drew on for more than a dozen novels and five plays.         An accomplished horsewoman herself, Mrs. Keane never apologized for her own youthful enchantment with a world circumscribed by riding, dancing and clothes.  Indeed, she began writing as a teen-ager, she once acknowledged, to supplement her dress allowance.         She also took the precaution of using a pseudonym, M. J. Farrell, a name she  spied on a board outside an Irish pub while riding home from a hunt.         "It would have been death to be known as a writer," she once explained.         Although the real identity of M. J. Farrell had long since become known in Irish and English literary circles, it was not until "Good Behavior" that Mrs. Keane, whose original name had been Mary Nesta Skrine, felt secure in publishing under a name of her own.         After the publication of "Good Behavior," her earlier works, including "Conversation Piece" and "Rising Tide," were reissued, and Mrs. Keane added two  further novels, "Time After Time," (Knopf, 1983) and "Loving and Giving," published in the United States by Dutton as "Queen Lear."         Mrs. Keane, who mined the same vein of childhood experiences time after time, inevitably found new nuggets of insight or intrigue. Unlike her earlier works, which she once suggested were written to portray a life she had wished for herself, her later novels had more bite, depicting the darker side of life among the disenfranchised Anglo-Irish gentry. ("Good Behavior" begins as the main character is genteely murdering her own mother.)         As a young adult, Mrs. Keane continued her childhood interest in parties and  gaiety, marrying a young Irishman, Bobby Keane, four years her junior, but only  after living with him for five years.         In her mid-30's she added plays to her repertory, writing five with John Perry, including "Spring Meeting," which was directed by John Gielgud in 1938 and provided Margaret Rutherford with her first starring role.         When she was 40, her husband died, and Mrs. Keane, who had two daughters, Sally and Virginia, was so grief-stricken she found she no longer had the zest for writing. She did manage to turn out two more novels, but with the exception  of a play that was panned in 1961, she wrote nothing until "Good Behavior" marked her return to form in 1981.         She is survived by her daughters.       
         P. L. Travers, who insisted she had never meant to write for children when the magical nanny Mary Poppins leaped from her pen, died on Tuesday at her home  in London. She was 96.         Miss Travers, a native of Australia who had lived in England since she was a  young woman, had been at various times in her life a poet, journalist, essayist, film and theater critic, dancer, Shakespearean actress and scholar of folklore and myth.         But she became renowned for "Mary Poppins," which, if not consciously intended for children, has been devoured by generations of them since its publication in 1934. The book, which has sold millions of copies and has been translated into more than 20 languages, has inspired critical studies, a string  of sequels and the 1964 Walt Disney movie musical, starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.         "I think the idea of Mary Poppins has been blowing in and out of me, like a curtain at a window, all my life," Miss Travers said in 1964. The critic Richard Lingeman wrote that Miss Travers "has succeeded in creating a timeless world inhabited by real people and complete unto itself -- an immortal world that is summoned into being, unchanged whenever one opens a book."         A prolific writer who was still publishing well into her 80's, Miss Travers employed a precise, lyrical prose. Her entire body of work, whether for children or adults, is linked by a deep concern with myth and mysticism, a belief in the interconnectedness of human experience, and a ceaseless quest for meaning.         "Her great thing was E. M. Forster's wonderful phrase 'Only connect,' " Jenny Koralek, a children's writer and longtime friend, said by telephone from London  yesterday. "That is the key to her entirely: a wonderful ranging mind and heart, putting together the pieces of life."         A gracious observer of the English proprieties who at the same time did not suffer fools gladly, Miss Travers had deep blue eyes, high cheekbones and, as a  young woman, a cap of curly dark gold hair. Her likeness appears once, hidden in Mary Shepard's illustrations, in each of the many Mary Poppins books.         Miss Travers, who demonstrated the gravest consideration for children but often displayed a tart impatience with her adult interrogators, was taciturn to  the point of secrecy about the details of her personal life. Partly to render herself anonymous, she signed her work only with her initials instead of the name -- Pamela Lyndon Travers -- that she adopted when she went on the stage as  a young woman.         As a result of her fierce privacy, concrete information about Miss Travers's  life is often elusive. She frequently supplied interviewers with different renditions of events large and small, as if these variant accounts had arisen from the oral tradition that so often inspired her writing.         It is known that she was born Helen Lyndon Goff in Maryborough, Queensland, Australia, on Aug. 9, 1899, the eldest of three daughters of Robert and Margaret Goff. Her father was a sugar planter, and Miss Travers recalled growing up near  the Great Barrier Reef in a tropical world of sugar cane, shells and mangoes. Miss Travers's Irish father and her mother, an Australian of Scottish and Irish  descent, infused the household with the mystery and melancholy of the literary traditions of the British Isles.         "Many a phrase, as ordinary to me then as the daily porridge, began its life, as I later learned, as a quotation from a poem or snatch from a ballad," she once said.         A voracious reader, Miss Travers began writing stories as a young child. Her  principal influences, she later said, were fairy tales and the Bible. A formative event in Miss Travers's childhood was the death of her father when she was 7. She moved with her mother and sisters to New South Wales to live with a great-aunt, who years later would become the title character in Miss Travers's 1941 book, "Aunt Sass."         Throughout her writing life, Miss Travers retained the extraordinary ability  to tap into the private, wistful anguish of childhood, and often said that she viewed the passage from childhood to adulthood as a single unbroken thread. "The ideas I had then move about in me now," she once said, adding elsewhere that "sorrow lies like a heartbeat behind everything I have written."         Miss Travers began her acting career at 10, when she was cast in a professional production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." As a teen-ager, she toured Australia with a Shakespearean company. She also worked as a dancer and journalist, and began publishing poetry. Sometime during this period she adopted the professional name Pamela Travers.         In 1924 Miss Travers left Australia for England, arriving with five pounds in her pocket. She soon began contributing poems to The Irish Statesman, a literary weekly whose editor, George William Russell, was the poet A. E. Through A. E., who became a mentor and lifelong friend, and through W. B. Yeats, to whom he introduced her, Miss Travers began to pursue the deep interest in Celtic folklore and Eastern mysticism that is palpable in all her subsequent work. Miss Travers also contributed film and theater criticism to the weekly The New English.         In 1934 Mary Poppins blew into Miss Travers's life and remained long enough to be captured on paper. Miss Travers was living in Sussex, recuperating from an illness in a 900-year-old thatched cottage mentioned in the Domesday Book. One day she found herself with two bored visiting children to entertain. She came up with a story about a raven-haired, rosy-cheeked governess who arrives with her carpetbag and parrot-headed umbrella at 17 Cherry Tree Lane to care for Jane and Michael Banks and their siblings. When Mary Poppins wasn't busy ruling the nursery with a will of iron, or admiring her own reflection in a shop window, she worked fabulous deeds: sliding up banisters, presiding at tea parties held on the ceiling, pasting gold paper stars in the heavens at night.         Encouraged by friends, Miss Travers published "Mary Poppins," which was an immediate critical success. A sequel, "Mary Poppins Comes Back," appeared the following year. It was followed by "Mary Poppins Opens the Door" (1943), "Mary Poppins in the Park" (1952), "Mary Poppins From A to Z" (1962), "Mary Poppins in Cherry Tree Lane" (1982) and "Mary Poppins and the House Next Door (1988).         "Nothing I had written before 'Mary Poppins' had anything to do with children, and I have always assumed, when I thought about it at all, that she had come out of the same wall of nothingness as the poetry, myth and legend that had absorbed me all my writing life," she wrote in 1978.         Although the Mary Poppins books were set permanently in the London of the 1930's, the Disney film was transposed to Edwardian times at Miss Travers's suggestion to give it a period sensibility. But despite her collaboration, Miss  Travers expressed dissatisfaction with the finished product.         "I think I was disturbed at seeing it so externalized, so oversimplified, so  generalized," she said in a 1967 interview. "I think that 'Mary Poppins' needs a subtle reader, in many respects, to grasp all its implications, and I understand that these cannot be translated in terms of the film."         After the outbreak of World War II, Miss Travers spent the years from 1940 to 1945 in the United States. Her experience became the basis for her 1941 book "I  Go by Sea, I Go by Land," the fictional diary of an 11-year-old girl who, like Miss Travers, was evacuated from England. The author would later return to the United States as a writer in residence at Radcliffe College in 1965 and at Smith College the following year.         In the decades after the war, Miss Travers continued to write. From 1976 on she was a consulting editor of the New York-based journal Parabola, which is devoted to the scholarly exploration of myth and tradition. Ms. Travers's books  during these years include "Friend Monkey," a 1971 retelling of the Hindu myth of the monkey lord Hanuman, a 1973 biography of the Russian mystic G. I. Gurdjieff, "About the Sleeping Beauty" (1975), a critical exploration of the fairy tale, and "What the Bee Knows" (1989), a collection of her Parabola pieces.         Miss Travers became the subject of public controversy in the early 1980's after "Mary Poppins" was banned from the San Francisco Public Library because of concerns over its treatment of members of minority groups. Of particular concern was the chapter entitled "Bad Tuesday," in which Mary Poppins and her charges travel to exotic corners of the world, meeting, among other characters, a black  woman on a South Sea island who holds a "pickaninny" on her lap, speaks in an American Southern dialect and offers everyone watermelon.         She rewrote the chapter for the 1981 revised edition of the book, substituting exotic animals for the offending ethnic characters. But in her public comments about making the revisions, she adopted a somewhat defensive tone. "I have done so not as an apology for anything I have written," she said.  "The reason is much more simple: I do not wish to see Mary Poppins tucked away in a closet."         In recent years, as her health began to decline, Miss Travers was confined increasingly to her home, a white Georgian town house with a bright pink front door in London's Chelsea section. Although she had previously stated that she looked forward to her old age, when she could sit in her rocking chair knowing all the answers, she grew incensed when a reporter for The New York Times asked  her about it in a 1994 interview. "But here I am sitting in my chair, and I don't think I'm going to know all the answers," she shouted. "I'm human."         Miss Travers, who never married, is survived by an adopted son, Camillus Travers of London, and three grandchildren.       
         Greer Garson, the actress who epitomized a noble, wise and courageous wife in some of the sleekest and most sentimental American movies of the 1940's, died yesterday morning at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. She was 92.         Miss Garson, who had a history of heart problems, had lived at the long-term-care hospital for the last three years, according to Ann Harper, a spokeswoman at the hospital.         Miss Garson became an instant success as a captivating young wife in the sentimental 1939 film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips." She was nominated for an Academy Award for this first film performance and quickly became one of the 10 most popular Hollywood stars.         She received five more Oscar nominations in five years for self-sacrificing portrayals in "Blossoms in the Dust" (1941), "Mrs. Miniver" (1942), "Madame Curie" (1943), "Mrs. Parkington" (1944) and "The Valley of Decision" (1945). She won the best actress Oscar for "Mrs. Miniver," in which she superbly symbolized  the spirit and virtue of a British homemaker in wartime.         With much of the earth ravaged by World War II, the Scotch-Irish actress with titian hair, blue-green eyes and alabaster complexion filled a need for a dignified and intrepid wife-mother figure. Her portrayals were so proper that one sequence in "Random Harvest," a major dramatic hit of 1942, created a sensation when she was allowed to wear kilts and show her shapely legs. Otherwise, she was heavily costumed and wholesomely typecast by Louis B. Mayer.         After the war, because of inferior vehicles and changing tastes, she was unable to escape the mold.         Nonetheless, in her Broadway debut in 1958, Miss Garson won acclaim in a comedy, succeeding Rosalind Russell as the devil-may-care "Auntie Mame." Two years later, Miss Garson received a seventh Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in the film "Sunrise at Campobello."         While preparing for "Auntie Mame" she told an interviewer: "I'm tired of playing four-handkerchief heroines in crinoline roles. I think there's a little  bit of 'Auntie Mame' in every woman -- a kind of counterpart to the 'Walter Mitty' in every man. I think Mrs. Miniver and Auntie Mame would have gotten along real well. Mame's really a doll. She promoted a liveliness and kindliness, and isn't that the best one can do?"         Early on, the actress enjoyed peerless popularity. Nine of her first 11 movies opened at Radio City Music Hall and played at that premier movie palace a total of 64 weeks. In 1978, Vincent Canby of The New York Times offered a tribute in which he deemed Miss Garson "emblematic of everything the Music Hall offered its patrons."         "In her high-toned M-G-M pictures she was invariably serene, polite, elegant  in a slightly unreal way, too good to be true, always prepared to meet any emergency and staunchly middle-class," Mr. Canby continued. "Her pictures were neither inhibited by the Hall nor did they ever look tacky amid all that splendor. Actress and theater were one."         Greer Garson was born on Sept. 29, 1903, in County Down, Northern Ireland, of Presbyterian parents. Her father, George Garson, a businessman, died soon after, and she and her mother, Nina, moved to London. The name Greer was a contraction  of MacGregor, her mother's ancestral name.         She was a frail girl with chronic bronchitis who was comfortable with her many adult relatives but uneasy with people her own age. She recalled a childhood of scrimping, study and an abiding ambition to act despite her family's pressure on her to teach. She received full scholarships from a county  school and from the University of London, where she won honors studying French and 18th-century literature in an accelerated course, with secretarial classes for a backup.         Miss Garson obtained a secure post as a market researcher for a London advertising firm, but gave it up to study acting with the Birmingham Repertory Theater during two years in the provinces, where she received increasingly         favorable notices.         She polished her craft during two years in the West End, starring in eight plays, including Shaw's "Too True to Be Good," and became one of Britain's ablest young stage actresses. Most of the plays were flops, but she was praised  for her talent, drive and professionalism. Envious associates dubbed her Ca-Reer Garson, a tag that trailed her to Hollywood.         In one theater audience in 1938 was the head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Riveted  by her performance, Mayer persuaded her to sign a movie contract for an uncommonly high starting salary of $500 a week. She confirmed his faith by her performance in "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" and further confirmed her skill in an effervescent 1940 film version of Jane Austen's novel "Pride and Prejudice," co-starring Laurence Olivier.         Miss Garson then entered her wartime phase of idealized helpmates, appearing  regularly with Walter Pidgeon. She inherited the mantle of M-G-M's First Lady from Norma Shearer, who had retired, and was indelibly typecast as what she ironically called "Metro's Glorified Mrs."         Her postwar, mostly unsuccessful, movies included "Adventure" (1946), co-starring Clark Gable; "That Forsythe Woman" (1949), with Errol Flynn and Mr.  Pidgeon, and the cameo role of Calpurnia in "Julius Caesar" (1953). In later years, she co-produced several plays in New York, including "On Golden Pond."         Miss Garson's marriages to Edward A. A. Snelson, a British civil servant, and to Richard Ney, an actor 10 years her junior who had played her son in "Mrs. Miniver," ended in divorce. In 1949, she married E. E. (Buddy) Fogelson, an oil  developer and industrialist. The Fogelsons had homes in Dallas and Los Angeles and a ranch outside Santa Fe, N.M., where they were civic leaders. Mr. Fogelson  died in 1987.         The actress's recreations included raising cattle and domestic animals as well as gardening and fishing. She continued to support the performing arts, giving $10 million to Southern Methodist University in Dallas for the Greer Garson Theater, which opened in September 1992. Asked once if she missed Hollywood, she replied: "No. I have at long last learned to be interested in where I am."         She is survived by a stepson, Gayle D. Fogelson, of Dallas.       
         Ariel Allen, a senior advertising executive for the Colgate-Palmolive Company, died on April 7 in New York. She was 58.         The cause of death was cancer, the company said.         Miss Allen joined the Ted Bates advertising agency in 1960 to work on the Colgate account.         She then moved to the Norman, Craig & Kummel agency, still working on the Colgate account. In 1971, she joined Colgate as vice president for creative services, developing television commercials with various advertising agencies.         In 1992, she assumed major responsibilities for the company's television advertising around the world as vice president for creative services in global advertising.         In 1988, the trade publication Advertising Age named her to its "100 of the Best and Brightest Women in Advertising" list and in 1989, Business Week included her in its list of "Women in Corporate America to Watch."         She had served as a chairman of the American Advertising Federation National  Convention.         Miss Allen is survived by her mother, Shirley Adsit, and her sister, Louisa Brownell.       
         Frances L. Loeb, who spent a dozen years as New York City's liaison to its vast corps of foreign diplomats and a lifetime maintaining a family tradition of philanthropy, died on Friday at her home on Park Avenue. Mrs. Loeb, who also had homes in Purchase, N.Y., and Lyford Cay, Nassau, the Bahamas, was 89.         "One thing I had in my mind," Mrs. Loeb said in 1990 when she announced a $7.5 million gift to Vassar College for construction of an art center, "I'm never going to be the richest person in the cemetery."         With her husband, John L. Loeb, an investment banker, and other family members, Mrs. Loeb was a benefactor of Barnard College (where Adele Lehman Hall  was named for her mother), of Central Park (the Loeb Boathouse and the Children's Zoo), Lewisohn Stadium (which bore her maternal grandfather's name),  the Loeb Student Center at New York University and the Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center at Vassar.         In 1990, the Loebs pledged $70.5 million to finance new faculty positions and scholarships to Harvard College, as well as programs and positions in the schools of design and public health. The gift also benefited the Loeb Drama Center, home to the American Repertory Theater, established in 1957 with help from the Loebs.         Mrs. Loeb was also a trustee of Vassar and Cornell University and an overseer of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.         In addition to money, Mrs. Loeb gave time. For 12 years in the 1960's and 70's, during the administrations of Mayors John V. Lindsay and Abraham D. Beame, Mrs. Loeb was New York City's unsalaried commissioner for the United Nations and for the Consular Corps. Directing a staff of nine full-time and six part-time employees, Mrs. Loeb eased cultural shock and fostered amity in a foreign diplomatic community that numbered 35,000 people from 197 missions and 91 consulates.         Besides forgoing a salary, Mrs. Loeb stretched the commission's relatively scant $158,000 budget by coaxing, cajoling and wheedling tens of thousands of dollars from friends and family. She committed the gifts to financing lectures,  establishing nursery schools, providing counseling about high schools and colleges and sponsoring courses in English.         In 1976, Mrs. Loeb and her staff handled more than 1,800 inquiries about housing, education, traffic, consumer fraud, police, family matters and legal problems. Thirty volunteers made more than 900 visits or telephone calls to 796  new diplomatic arrivals, and Mrs. Loeb attended endless receptions, lunches and  dinner meetings.         Frances Lehman Loeb was born in Manhattan on Sept. 25, 1906, into two of the  German-Jewish families whose rise to prominence and zeal for public service were chronicled in Stephen Birmingham's 1972 book, "Our Crowd." These 100 or so families founded banking, securities and retailing empires and many were known for their philanthropies. Her mother was Adele Lewisohn, the daughter of Adolph  Lewisohn, who made his fortune shipping mining products. Her father was Arthur Lehman of the investment banking family. One uncle, Herbert H. Lehman, became Governor of New York. Another uncle, Irving Lehman, became Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals.         Frances Lehman attended Vassar from 1924 to 1926. In 1926 she and John Loeb were married in the Park Avenue apartment of her grandfather Adolph Lewisohn. From the 1930's through the 1970's, Mr. Loeb was a partner in the investment firm of Loeb, Rhoades & Company.         Throughout her life, Mrs. Loeb was known as Peter, a name she traced to the days when she was "the unwanted girl baby" and "Peter Pan" was playing on Broadway.         "I was a sick child," she said, "and they called me Peter Pan, hoping that I  would live forever."         Besides her husband of 69 years, Mrs. Loeb is survived by their five children: Judith L. Chiara of Manhattan and Purchase, John L. Loeb Jr. of Manhattan and Purchase, Ann Loeb Bronfman of Washington, Arthur Lehman Loeb of Manhattan and Deborah Loeb Brice of London; 14 grandchildren, and more than 30 great-grandchildren.       
         Bettina Bancroft, a former director of Dow Jones & Company, which publishes The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine, died on Tuesday, at her Los Angeles home. Ms. Bancroft, who was 55, also had a residence in Manhattan, where she was involved in foundation work.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Andrew Klink, said.         A great-granddaughter of Clarence W. Barron, who bought Dow Jones in 1902 from a co-founder, Charles H. Dow, she became a director in 1982 to represent the Bancroft and Barron family descendants. She retired from the board in April, but remained a director of the Dow Jones Foundation.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Bettina Gray of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.; a daughter, Elisabeth Goth of Del Mar, Calif.; three brothers, Christopher Bancroft of Denton, Tex., Hugh Bancroft 3d of Aspen, Colo., and William P. Liscomb 3d of Carlsbad, Calif., and a sister, Kathryn Kavadas of Waban, Mass.         A previous marriage, to Michael R. Goth, ended in divorce in 1974. A son, Michael B. Goth, died in 1990.       
         Dorothy Hyson, a Chicago-born stage and screen actress of the 1930's and 40's who was famed for her beauty, died on Thursday in a London hospital. She was 81  and had moved to London with her parents as a child.         She had been in declining health after suffering a stroke, The Times of London reported.         Miss Hyson's second husband, the actor and director Sir Anthony Quayle, once remarked: "It was not only her beauty that possessed me. It was a radiant lightness of heart."         She was often said to have inspired the 1935 Rodgers and Hart hit song "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World," with what The Guardian on Saturday called "her blue eyes, blond hair, and fragile singing and dancing style."         Miss Hyson made her screen debut as a child in the movie "Money Mad" and her  stage debut in London in a 1927 play, "Quality Street," by J. M. Barrie.         The Daily Telegraph said that on the London stage she "scored her greatest triumph in the thriller 'Pink String and Sealing Wax,' " which opened in 1943.         Her first marriage, to the actor Robert Douglas, ended in divorce. Sir Anthony died in 1989. Her mother, the musical-comedy star Dorothy Dickson, died  last year at the age of 102.         Miss Hyson is survived by two daughters and a son.       
         Tamara Toumanova, a child-prodigy ballerina of the 1930's who became familiar to American audiences as one of the most glamorous stars of 20th-century dance,  died on Wednesday at the Santa Monica Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 77 and lived in Beverly Hills.         She died after a brief illness, said John Taras, a friend.         By the time she was 13, Miss Toumanova was internationally acclaimed as one  of the three so-called baby ballerinas of Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes. She and two other phenomenally gifted daughters of Russian emigres -- Irina Baronova and Tatiana Riabouchinska -- were discovered in Parisian ballet studios by George Balanchine. They soon became the talk of London and New York.         Adoring fans nicknamed Miss Toumanova "the black pearl of the Russian ballet." Even as a teen-ager, her beauty was as remarkable as her technique. Kathrine Sorley Walker, a British dance historian, said of her in "De Basil's Ballets Russes" (1983) that with her "large dark eyes, raven wings of hair and magnolia skin, she combined lyricism and virtuosity to a remarkable degree."         A founding member of the de Basil Ballets Russes in 1932, Miss Toumanova inspired two of this century's greatest choreographers. She created roles in Balanchine's "Cotillon" and "Concurrence" and in Leonide Massine's "Jeux d'Enfants" with the company. She left the following year and was given starring  roles by Balanchine in his short-lived troupe Les Ballets 1933. Returning to the Ballets Russes a few months afterward, she danced in the classics as well as in  such new works by Massine as "Choreartium" and "Symphonie Fantastique." Later in her career, she performed with Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and appeared in a number of Hollywood films.         Miss Toumanova was born on March 2, 1919, in a boxcar in Siberia. She was the daughter of a czarist army colonel and his wife, who were fleeing the Bolsheviks. The couple settled in Paris, where their daughter became a pupil of  Olga Preobrajenska, a Russian-born teacher.         Miss Toumanova astonished balletgoers in 1929, at the age of 9, when she appeared at the Paris Opera in "L'Eventail de Jeanne," a ballet with a cast of children. Reviewing the production in the theatrical magazine Comoedia, Andre Levinson, the most famous Parisian ballet critic of the time, called Miss Toumanova's dancing both "astonishing" and "frightening."         When quarrels between de Basil and Massine prompted the choreographer to form his own company, Miss Toumanova became a member of Massine's new Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938. She dropped out of the company the next year to appear in the Broadway musical "Stars in Your Eyes," and rejoined de Basil's company for an Australian tour and the New York season that followed it in 1940. She was once again a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1940 to 1942, and during the 1944-45 season, was a star of Ballet Theater.         As she toured the world, Miss Toumanova was accompanied by her mother, Eugenia, one of the most famous of the "ballet mothers" of the 1930's. These mothers went everywhere with their daughters, serving as dressers, laundresses,  cooks and pet keepers. In addition, the mothers were their daughters' fiercest partisans and sternest critics. Eugenia Toumanova was also said to be fond of fortune telling, faith healing and poker playing.         When, as a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Miss Toumanova was cast in the virtuosic Black Swan pas de deux from "Swan Lake," she and her mother would minutely inspect the stage to choose the spot at which the ballerina would perform a notoriously difficult series of whipping turns known as fouettes. Then they would pray over that spot. The fouettes never faltered. Grace Robert, an American dance historian, said of the Black Swan in her "Borzoi Book of Ballets" (1946): "Tamara Toumanova is at her exciting best in this tour de force, its vertiginous turns and sustained balances exactly suiting her temperament and forceful technique."         Miss Toumanova's later career, although a distinguished one, did not always seem as remarkable as her youthful achievements. After leaving Ballet Theater, she became a freelance ballerina, appearing with such companies as the Paris Opera Ballet, London Festival Ballet and the Marquis de Cuevas Grand Ballet. During the 1960's, she toured extensively in South America with Vladimir Oukhtomsky as her partner.         She created two notable roles with the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1947, she was a star of "Le Palais de Cristal," the glittering abstract ballet by Balanchine that is known in America as "Symphony in C." Three years later, she displayed her dramatic talents in the title role of Serge Lifar's "Phedre."         Some critics thought Miss Toumanova acquired annoying mannerisms. Reviewing her in the London Festival Ballet production of "Swan Lake" in 1955, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, complained that "her grandiosity (including some incredible bows) smothered the whole work like  so much thick chocolate sauce."         Nevertheless, she remained capable of extraordinary performances. Seeing her  at the Paris Opera in 1950, the American critic Edward Denby wrote in "Dancers,  Buildings and People in the Streets" (1965) that he was distressed by her "careless feet, limp and wormy arms, brutally deformed phrasings" but that his objections vanished when she offered "a few terrifying extensions, a few incisive strokes that counted phenomenally."         "At these moments," he went on, "she had so much vitality she made everyone else look as if they merely crept or scuttled about her while she danced."         Miss Toumanova acted and danced in several movies. She made her screen debut  in "Days of Glory" in 1944. That same year, she married the film's producer and  screen writer, Casey Robinson; the marriage ended in divorce. Miss Toumanova played the ballerina Anna Pavlova in "Tonight We Sing" in 1953 and appeared in "Deep in My Heart" in 1954. She had a starring role in "Invitation to the Dance," a ballet film directed by Gene Kelly in 1955. She was also in Alfred Hitchcock's "Torn Curtain" (1966) and Billy Wilder's "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" (1969).         Miss Toumanova, who became an American citizen in 1944, lived quietly in later years at her home in Beverly Hills.         No immediate family members survive.       
         She was just 17 when she climbed on the shoulders of Karl Wallenda in the debut performance of the Wallenda pyramid in Madison Square Garden in 1928. The  act brought the audience to its feet and stopped the Greatest Show on Earth for 11 minutes.         Helen Kreis Wallenda, who formed the pinnacle of the famous Wallenda high-wire pyramid many times during 30 years of performing, died on Thursday in  Sarasota. She was 85 and the last member of the original four-member Great Wallendas high-wire troupe. She was the widow of the group's founder, Karl Wallenda.         Mrs. Wallenda retired in 1956, six years before the seven-person pyramid fell in Detroit, killing two members of the troupe and leaving her adopted son,  Mario, paralyzed. Tragedy struck again in 1964 when her sister, Rietta Grotefent, died in a fall from the wire.         She was in San Juan, P.R., in 1978 when Karl Wallenda, whom she married in 1935, fell 10 stories to his death while trying to walk a wire strung between two hotels.         "My mother was not only the greatest aerialist in her field, she was a very dignified lady," said her daughter, Carla Wallenda Guzman. "She loved to perform, then she loved being grandma."         Ms. Guzman likes to tell the story about how her mother, at 72, helped her son-in-law, Mike Morgan, learn the wire act. "She got hold of my husband's shoulders and started climbing up on his shoulders as he balanced on a low wire," said Ms. Guzman, who had been performing in New York until she learned of her mother's illness earlier this week.         "She refused to watch us perform. It scared her."         Yet Helen Wallenda's specialty was climbing like a cat onto the shoulders of  her husband, while he was balanced on a chair on the wire.         She was born Dec. 11, 1910, in Germany and joined Karl Wallenda and his daredevil troupe when she was 16, touring throughout Europe.         She came to America in 1928 with the original Wallenda act of Karl and Herman Wallenda and Joe Geiger, and to Sarasota because it was the winter quarters of the Ringling show. She and her husband bought a two-story home in Sarasota where she cared for grandchildren when the rest of the family was touring.         In addition to her daughter, Carla, she is survived by two other children, Jenny Wallenda Anderson and Mario Wallenda; six grandchildren, and 17 great-grandchildren.       
         Beatrice Procter Frelinghuysen, the wife of one Congressman and mother of another, who was on the boards of nonprofit organizations in the fields of botany and ballet, died on Monday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in Morristown, N.J., where she lived. She was 77.         The cause was complications from pneumonia, said her son Peter.         Mrs. Frelinghuysen was a member of a family that has long been prominent in  New Jersey's public life. She was the wife of Peter H. B. Frelinghuysen, a Republican who represented north central New Jersey in the House from 1953 through 1974. He is related to four earlier Frelinghuysens who were United States senators, one of whom, Frederick T., became a Secretary of State under President Chester A. Arthur.         She and her husband had five children, including Rodney P. Frelinghuysen, also a Republican Congressman from north central New Jersey, who was elected in  1994.         At her death, Mrs. Frelinghuysen was on the board of the Berkshire Botanical  Garden in Stockbridge, Mass. In the 1980's, she was on the board of the National Tropical Botanical Garden in Hawaii.         In addition, she was for some years a member of the advisory committee of the School of American Ballet, which is part of the Lincoln Center complex.         Mrs. Frelinghuysen was a native of Manhattan, the daughter of Rodney Procter, a stockbroker and investor, and the former Beatrice Sterling.         Besides her husband of 56 years and her sons Peter, of Manhattan, and Rodney, of Morristown, she is survived by another son, Frederick, of Tucson, Ariz.; two  daughters, Beatrice van Roijen of Washington and Adaline Ogilvie-Laing of Manhattan, 13 grandchildren and a sister, Mrs. Anson Phelps Stokes Jr.       
         Marjorie Gross, a writer and producer of the television series "Seinfeld," who also wrote a humorous article about her ovarian cancer in The New Yorker in  April, died of the illness on June 7 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 40.         Ms. Gross was born in Toronto and got her start doing stand-up comedy in local clubs. She moved to New York City, where she was one of a group of female  stand-up comedians, who were then a relative rarity, performing at Catch a Rising Star, the Comic Strip and the Improvisation.         In 1981, Ms. Gross broke into television as a writer for the sitcom "Square  Pegs," with Sarah Jessica Parker. She also appeared on "Late Show With David Letterman." Then in 1994, she joined two old friends, Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, as a writer for "Seinfeld."         Even after her ovarian cancer was diagnosed two and a half years ago, Ms. Gross kept working. "Jerry put a cot in her office for her so she could lie down," her brother Jonathan said.         Among the "Seinfeld" shows Ms. Gross wrote, with Peter Mehlman, was the shower head episode, which was rebroadcast on Thursday. The episode was an extended riff on the drawbacks of environmentally approved low-flow shower heads. One by one, the show's characters made their appearance with flattened hair because their showers lacked enough pressure to rinse out shampoo.         In her New Yorker article about having ovarian cancer, a disease that killed  her mother, Ms. Gross made the illness sound like nothing more than a vast practical joke. In the piece, titled "Cancer Becomes Me," she made light of some of the darker aspects of her illness, noting the way doctors tend to use different analogies when describing tumors in women and men. "They found a tumor that they said was the size of an orange," she wrote. "See, for women they use the citrus fruit comparison; for men it's sporting goods: Oh, it's the size of a softball, or in England, a cricket ball."         She listed some "advantages" to being sick, including, "You automatically get called courageous," and, "Everyone returns your calls immediately: having cancer is like being Mike Ovitz."         Besides her brother, of Toronto, she is survived by her father, Jules Gross,  and another brother, Adam, both of whom also live in Toronto.       
         Susan Kirk, a vice president of Parsons Brinckerhoff Quade & Douglas, a leading transportation engineering and consulting firm in Manhattan who had been an aide to Gov. Jim Florio of New Jersey, died on Monday at Riverview Regional Cancer Center in Red Bank, N.J. She was 44 and lived in Jersey City.         She suffered a lengthy illness.         Ms. Kirk was Parsons Brinckerhoff's manager of planning, environmental and management services in New York City, guiding urban and transportation planning, and environmental and economic analyses.         She had been assistant to the president and director of business development  for the firm's New York/ New Jersey metropolitan district.         Before she joined the company, she was New Jersey's transportation policy coordinator and deputy director of policy in the office of Governor Florio. She  was also the Governor's liaison to bistate agencies, like the Port Authority of  New York and New Jersey and the Delaware River Port Authority.         She was born in Jersey City and graduated in political science and urban studies from St. Peter's College. She also attended the Wharton School of Executive Education at the University of Pennsylvania.         She is survived by her mother, Rosemary Kirk of Red Bank; three brothers, Daniel and Kevin, of Middletown, N.J., and Brian, of Red Bank; two sisters, Jane Ann Coutu of Fair Haven, N.J., and Kathleen Yostpille of Shrewsbury, N.J., and her companion, Russ Dorn of Las Vegas, Nev.       
         Mollie H. Beattie, who resigned as director of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on June 6 because of failing health, died on Thursday at Grace  Cottage Hospital in Townsend, Vt. She was 49 and lived in Grafton and Alexandria, Va.         The cause was brain cancer, said a friend, Alexandra M. Marks.         A forester by training, Ms. Beattie was the first woman to head the agency.  In three years as director, she defended the Endangered Species Act against attacks from many Republicans in Congress and fought efforts to reduce the agency's budget, not always successfully.         "In the Clinton Administration, she was probably the strongest single voice for wildlife conservation," said Rodger Schlickeisen, president of the Defenders of Wildlife, a nonprofit group that works to protect and preserve species.         Ms. Beattie was a strong proponent of the effort to have gray wolves in Yellowstone National Park for the first time since the 1920's. Mr. Schlickeisen  said one of his most vivid memories of her was seeing her rub cold water on the  belly of a wild wolf at Yellowstone in April to cool it so the animal could be moved to another site for release. Despite the rain in her face, he recalled, she smiled broadly and said, "Any day I can touch a wild wolf is a good day."         As director, she was responsible for the wildlife service's 7,000 employees and an annual budget for resource management of $501 million in the current fiscal year, down from $511 million the previous year. The agency, part of the Interior Department, enforces wildlife laws, administers the Endangered Species  Act and carries out wetland protection and management. John Rogers has been serving as acting director.         Ms. Beattie sought to conserve species by managing entire ecosystems rather than waiting until individual species became endangered, and presided over the addition of 15 national wildlife refuges to a system that now has 508.         The agency said that under her direction 140 habitat conservation plans were  established and 300 more were being developed. These plans are formal agreements between landowners and the Fish and Wildlife Service that allow the owners to harm individual members of a species listed as endangered or threatened if they  take steps to help the species as a whole to recover.         She argued that such plans demonstrated that the Endangered Species Act, under which they are carried out, has the flexibility to conserve species while  allowing economic development. In fact, she said, the act "has been one of the biggest success stories of the conservation movement in America," contending that many myths had been spread about the act's supposedly onerous effects.         Just before she resigned, she led efforts to resume the listing of endangered species after a 13-month moratorium imposed by Congress, which sharply cut the agency's money for such listings in the current fiscal year.         Earlier this month, Representative Don Young, Republican of Alaska, introduced legislation in the House and Senator Ted Stevens, Republican of Alaska, in the Senate to name an eight-million-acre wilderness in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge after her.         Mollie Beattie was born on April 27, 1947, in Glen Cove, L.I. She earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy at Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y., in 1968 and a master's degree in forestry at the University of Vermont in 1979. She also received a master's degree in public administration from Harvard University in 1991.         She was program director and lands manager for the Windham Foundation, a nonprofit organization that conducts seminars on critical issues facing Vermont, from 1983 to 1985; commissioner of the Vermont Department of Forests, Parks and  Recreation from 1985 to 1989, and deputy secretary of the state's Agency of Natural Resources from 1989 to 1990. She left to become executive director of a  public policy institute, the Richard A. Snelling Center for Government in Vermont, before taking her post at the Fish and Wildlife Service.         She is survived by her husband, Rick Schwolsky of Grafton; her mother, Patricia Beattie of Ketchum, Idaho, and a sister, Jane Beattie, also of Ketchum.       
         Jan Kerouac, a novelist and the only child of the Beat Generation's icon Jack Kerouac, died on Wednesday at Lovelace Medical Center here. She was 44.         Ms. Kerouac died a day after her spleen was removed. She had suffered kidney  failure five years ago and had been on dialysis, said Gerald Nicosia, her father's biographer.         Ms. Kerouac, who had met her father only twice -- when she was 9 and when she was 15 -- had fought in recent years to gain control of his archives. In 1994, she sued relatives of Mr. Kerouac's last wife, Stella Sampas, who inherited the notebooks, teletype rolls and parchment scrolls on which he wrote  "On the Road" and laid down the first rumblings of postwar alienation that set the tone for the Beat Generation of the 1950's.         Ms. Kerouac argued that the will of Mr. Kerouac's mother, Gabrielle Kerouac,  which left her son's effects to Stella Sampas, was a forgery. Had Mrs. Kerouac died without a will, the estate would have gone to her two grandchildren, Jan Kerouac and Paul Blake Jr. Jack Kerouac died in 1969.         Ms. Kerouac's lawyer said a trial was tentatively set for September in St. Petersburg, Fla.         "Her main intent was to put it into a museum or a library and preserve it forever," Mr. Nicosia, the biographer, said.         Ms. Kerouac had also tried to have her father's remains moved from Lowell, Mass., where he was born and reared, to Nashua, N.H., where the Kerouacs have a  family plot. That effort failed.         Ms. Kerouac's first novel, "Baby Driver," was published in 1981. It dealt with her childhood on the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the turbulent 1960's. Her second, "Trainsong" (1988), was about her travels after the first book.         She had been working on "Parrot Fever," about the death of her mother, Joan Haverty, in 1991. She was Mr. Kerouac's second wife.         Ms. Kerouac's parents were estranged when she was born. The author denied being her father until she was 9, when he took a blood test and then acknowledged her as his daughter.       
         Lily Auchincloss, a philanthropist and major supporter of the Museum of Modern Art, the American Academy in Rome and the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Alexandra Herzan.         Mrs. Auchincloss was well known in New York cultural and social circles as an active and generous supporter of the arts with a keen interest in architecture and design.         A trustee at the Museum of Modern Art since 1971, she served on more than one-third of the museum's many trustee committees, including those of painting and sculpture, drawings and prints and illustrated books, and had been chairwoman of the museum's architecture and design committee since 1981.         In the 1990's, the several exhibitions she helped to finance included those of the architects Louis I. Kahn, Rem Koolhaus and Frank Lloyd Wright, as well as "Light Constructions" and "Cy Twombly: A Retrospective."         In 1994, the Modern named the Lily Auchincloss Center for Architecture and Design, a research facility, and 18 architects donated drawings to the collection in her honor. Terence Riley, chief curator of the department of art and architecture, said: "She was not a passive philanthropist. Her generosity came from a belief that the world could be a better and more beautiful place." Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern, said Mrs. Auchincloss was "one of the great, great trustees of our museum and involved with every aspect of its life."         Mrs. Auchincloss was born on April 5, 1922, in Newark. Her father, Arnold Louis van Ameringen, who was born in Holland, founded the International Flavors  and Fragrances Company. Her mother, Hedwig Pfaltz van Ameringen, who died last month at the age of 95, was a major supporter of the New York Philharmonic.         Although Mrs. Auchincloss's first cultural interest was music, her affinity for architecture and design was kindled at Radcliffe College, where she met Philip Johnson, formerly head of the department of architecture at the Museum of Modern Art, and the architect Marcel Breuer, with whom Mr. Johnson was studying  at Harvard. She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe in 1944.         From 1944 to 1958, Mrs. Auchincloss worked in New York City as an editor on magazines and newspapers, including Look, The World-Telegram, The Herald Tribune, Glamour, Harper's Bazaar and McCall's. In 1956, she married Douglas Auchincloss, a writer at Newsweek. They were divorced in 1979.         A lifelong Episcopalian, Mrs. Auchincloss became a trustee of St. John the Divine in 1975, where she founded a committee that supported the cathedral's presentations of art and music. She was especially interested in large free concerts and financed the first performance of Liszt's "Christus" Oratorio in 100 years in 1979 at the cathedral.         In 1991, Mrs. Auchincloss served on the jury for the competition for the design of the cathedral's new wing, which was won by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava.         In 1977, Mrs. Auchincloss became the first woman to join the board of the Cooper Union. She also served on the board of Japan Society, and was a director  of the Municipal Arts Society and a Fellow for Life of the Morgan Library.         A member of the board of the American Academy in Rome since 1982, she was a major contributor to the renovation of the Academy's McKim, Meade & White building in Rome.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by a brother, Henry P. van Ameringen of Manhattan; a sister, Patricia Kind of Huntingdon Valley, Pa., and a granddaughter.       
         Dr. Constance B. Wofsy, a medical professor and clinician who created a program to educate health workers about advances in AIDS treatments, died on Monday at her home in San Francisco. She was 53.         The cause was breast cancer, according to the University of California at San Francisco, where she was a faculty member. Dr. Wofsy was also co-director of the AIDS Program and associate chief of infectious diseases at San Francisco General Hospital.         As co-founder of the hospital's AIDS Program in 1983 with Dr. Paul Volberding, she was influential in providing medical services for young gay men  early in the AIDS epidemic. She also created and directed a program that has attracted hundreds of health professionals to the hospital from around the world to learn about the latest techniques in AIDS care.         Early in the epidemic she recognized that women were at risk and founded an organization in San Francisco called Aware (Association for Women's AIDS Research and Education), which offered confidential testing for H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, and counseling. It published some of the earliest data on the prevalence of H.I.V. infection in women at high risk in the San Francisco area.         Dr. Wofsy was the founding chairwoman of the Women's Health Committee of the  AIDS Clinical Trials Group of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. The group oversees and carries out studies of various therapies for AIDS.         She was one of the first AIDS experts to address the issue of workplace discrimination against H.I.V.-infected people, and provided education and training materials on the issue to corporations in San Francisco.         Constance Wofsy was born in Cheltenham, Pa., on Oct. 6, 1942. She earned a bachelor's degree in bacteriology at the University of California at Berkeley in 1964 and a medical degree at the University of Southern California at Los Angeles in 1971. She joined the faculty of the University of California at San Francisco in 1975 and became a full professor in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, David, who is also a medical professor at the university, a son, Kevin, and a daughter, Susan, all of San Francisco, and her mother, Ruth Blitman, of Novato, Calif.       
         Jo Van Fleet, who won an Academy Award, a Tony Award and other honors for her portrayal of proud, stoical women, died yesterday at Jamaica Hospital in Queens. She was 81.         Ms. Van Fleet was known as an actress's actress, a highly skilled professional who worked with equal ease onstage, in films and on television. For her first screen appearance in 1955, she won an Academy Award as best supporting actress for playing James Dean's mother in Elia Kazan's film "East of Eden." Two years later, she won a Tony Award as best featured actress for her role as the irritable Jessie Mae Watts in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful."         In her other signature role, in Mr. Kazan's "Wild River," she was Ella Garth, an 80-year-old matriarch who refuses to leave her island home despite the fact that it is about to be flooded by the Tennessee Valley Authority. In that film, Montgomery Clift played a sympathetic Government official.         Over the years she came to be known for playing mothers of diverse ethnic backgrounds, with the range running from naturalistic drama to absurdist comedy. She was Anthony Perkins's mother in "Look Homeward, Angel" on Broadway; the original smothering mama, Madame Rosepettle, in Arthur Kopit's "Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mama's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad," and Paul Newman's mother in the movie "Cool Hand Luke."         Her maternal gallery included the wicked stepmother in the 1965 television revival of Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Cinderella." The same year, she followed Maureen Stapleton as Amanda Wingfield in the 20th-anniversary production of "The Glass Menagerie."         Ms. Van Fleet, who was a member of the Actors Studio, often credited Mr. Kazan with having a major influence on her career. In addition to their film work, he directed her onstage in George Tabori's "Flight Into Egypt" and Tennessee Williams's "Camino Real," in which she created the role of Camille.         She was born in Oakland, Calif., and began her theatrical training at the College of the Pacific in Stockton, Calif. After studying with Sanford Meisner at the Neighborhood Playhouse, she made her New York debut in "The Winter's Tale" in 1946. In 1950, she played Regan to Louis Calhern's "King Lear." In the  1950's and 60's, she was often on Broadway and occasionally Off Broadway (in "Rosemary" and "The Alligators," a double bill by Molly Kazan).         With "East of Eden" she began a flourishing movie career. Her other films included "The Rose Tattoo," "I'll Cry Tomorrow," "A King and Four Queens," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral," "This Angry Age," "I Love You, Alice B. Toklas" and "The Gang That Couldn't Shoot Straight." In the 1970's, she often acted in regional theater.         Ms. Van Fleet was married to William Bales, a dancer and choreographer who died in 1990.         She is survived by a son, Michael, of Toronto, and a granddaughter.       
         Brigitte Helm, the German actress who defined the unobtainable, cool-eyed screen vamp as the haunting teen-age star of Fritz Lang's futuristic 1926 masterpiece, "Metropolis," died on Tuesday in Ascona, Switzerland, where she had lived in seclusion for more than 30 years. By her own account, she was 88.         She was the most sought-after actress of the glory days of the German film industry, a tall blond beauty who starred in more than 35 movies and set directors against one another in the competition for her services. Ms. Helm was  regarded as such a perfect embodiment of the era's ideal of cool sophistication  that when she turned Josef von Sternberg down for the starring role in "Blue Angel," he had to settle for Marlene Dietrich.         Yet for all the acclaim she received for such roles as her portrayal of a blind girl in Georg Wilhelm Pabst's "Love of Jeanne Ney," or as a bored aristocratic wanton in his "Crisis," Ms. Helm could never eclipse the role, or rather roles, in which the good Maria, an oppressed working girl, is transformed into an evil robotic doppelganger of herself in Lang's "Metropolis."         Even today, 70 years after it was released, "Metropolis," is not only a cult  classic, it is regularly listed among the half-dozen most important films ever made. This is a tribute, to be sure, to Lang's grotesque science-fiction vision, and the array of fabulous special effects he used to bring it to the screen. The film depicts the world of 2006, a time, Lang envisioned, when a ruling class lives in decadent luxury in the lofty heights of skyscrapers linked by aerial railways, while beneath the streets slavelike workers toil in unbearable conditions to sustain their masters.         But for all the steam and special effects, for many who have seen the movie in its various incarnations, including a tinted version and one accompanied by music, the most compelling lingering image is neither the towers above nor the hellish factories below. It is the startling transformation of Ms. Helm from an  idealistic young woman into a barely clad creature performing a lascivious dance in a brothel.         The scene is, in a way, a reflection of Ms. Helm's own transformation.  While she was a woman of rectitude who never became anything close to the vamps she portrayed on the screen, according to most accounts she was a reluctant recruit  to the movies. The daughter of a Prussian Army officer who died when she was a toddler, Ms. Helm, a native of Berlin whose original name was Eva Gisela Schittenhelm, was a serious, idealistic boarding school student who appeared willingly enough in school plays but who regarded movie acting with Prussian disdain as an immoral occupation on its face.         Then her mother, who had no such notions, sent her daughter's photograph to Lang's wife, the screenwriter, Thea von Harbou, and Ms. Helm, who was 16 when she was tricked into taking a screen test, was suddenly on her way to stardom.         While he may not have been the sadist many of his actors made him out to be,  Lang was such a hard-driving perfectionist that Ms. Helm, who worked virtually every day for 18 months, often hanging upside down or standing in water up to her waist for hours at a time, found the experience excruciating.         After one torturous ordeal, when she wondered why a double could not have taken her place during the nine days it took to shoot a scene in which she is encased in a metallic robot shell, her face obscured, Lang haughtily claimed an  auteur's creative sensibility.         "I have to feel that you are inside the robot," he said. "I was able to see you even when I didn't."         After the movie made her a star, Ms. Helm, who had her own artistic standards, refused to make another movie with Lang.         She made a successful transition to sound, but refused to abandon Germany for Hollywood. Then in 1935, disgusted with the Nazi takeover of the film industry,  she abruptly quit, marrying an industrialist, Hugo von Kunheim, himself a Nazi opponent.         The couple left Germany for Italy in 1942, but although they returned after the war, Ms. Helm had put her career so far behind her she made no further films and turned down almost all requests for interviews.         Ms. Helm's survivors include a son, Mathius Kunheim of London, two other sons and a daughter.       
         Ella Fitzgerald, whose sweet, silvery voice and endlessly inventive vocal improvisations made her the most celebrated jazz singer of her generation, died  yesterday at home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 79.         She had been suffering from diabetes and its eyesight and circulatory system  complications for many years. In 1993, both of her legs were amputated below the knees.         A pre-eminent American singer who brought a classic sense of musical proportion and balance to everything she touched, Miss Fitzgerald won the sobriquet "first lady of song" and earned the unqualified admiration of most of  her peers. Musicians from Bing Crosby to Benny Goodman, when asked to name their favorite singer, cited Ella Fitzgerald.         "Man, woman or child, Ella is the greatest," Crosby once said. Mel Torme hailed her as having "the best ear of any singer ever." Until the 1970's, when physical problems began to impinge on her perfect technique, this hefty, unglamorous woman seemed to loom as an immutable creative force in a musical world where everything else was crumbling.         In a career that spanned six decades, Miss Fitzgerald stood above the emotional fray of the scores of popular standards she performed. Stylistically she was the polar opposite of her equally legendary peer, Billie Holiday, who conveyed a wounded vulnerability. Even when handed a sad song, Miss Fitzgerald communicated a wistful, sweet-natured compassion for the heartache she described.         Where Holiday and Frank Sinatra lived out the dramas they sang about, Miss Fitzgerald, viewing them from afar, seemed to understand and forgive all. Her apparent equanimity and her clear pronunciation, which transcended race, ethnicity, class and age, made her a voice of profound reassurance and hope.         Over the decades, Miss Fitzgerald performed with big bands, symphony orchestras and small jazz groups. Her repertory encompassed show tunes, jazz songs, novelties (like her first major hit, "A-Tisket A-Tasket," recorded in 1938), bossa nova, and even opera ("Porgy and Bess" excerpts, recorded with Louis Armstrong). At her jazziest, her material became a springboard for ever-changing, ebullient vocal inventions, delivered in a sweet, girlish voice that could leap, slide or growl anywhere within a range of nearly three octaves.         Great Diction And Vocal Agility         Miss Fitzgerald was renowned both for her delicately rendered ballads and her pyrotechnical displays of scat improvisation. (The jazz historian Barry Ulanov traced the term be-bop to her spontaneous interpolation of the word "re-bop" in  her 1939 recording of "T'Ain't What You Do, It's the Way That You Do It.") She was sometimes criticized for a lack of bluesiness and emotional depth. But her perfect intonation, vocal acrobatics, clear diction and endless store of melodic improvisations -- all driven by powerful rhythmic undercurrents -- brought her nearly universal acclaim.         During her long career, Miss Fitzgerald recorded with Duke Ellington, Count Basie, and Louis Armstrong. Her series of "Songbook" albums, celebrating such songwriters as Cole Porter, Harold Arlen, the Gershwins, Rodgers and Hart and Duke Ellington, helped to elevate the work of the best American songwriters to a stature widely recognized as art song.         "I never knew how good our songs were," Ira Gershwin once said, "until I heard Ella Fitzgerald sing them."         Although most biographies give her birth date as 1918, her birth certificate  and school records show her to have been born a year earlier, on April 25, 1917, in Newport News, Va. She was the product of a common-law marriage between William Fitzgerald and Temperance Williams Fitzgerald. The couple separated within a year of her birth, and with her mother and a Portuguese immigrant named Joseph Da Silva, she moved to Yonkers.         As a child, Miss Fitzgerald dreamed of being a dancer. But she also sang and  was attracted to the recordings of Louis Armstrong, Bing Crosby and the Boswell  Sisters, in particular the group's lead singer, Connee Boswell.         "My mother brought home one of her records, and I fell in love with it," she  recalled many years later. "I tried so hard to sound just like her."         As a teen-ager, Miss Fitzgerald developed a dance routine with a friend, Charles Gulliver, which they performed in local clubs. Then in 1932, her mother  died suddenly, and she went to live with an aunt in Harlem.         On Nov. 21, 1934, she made her stage debut in an amateur contest at the Apollo Theater, singing two songs, "The Object of My Affection" and "Judy," in the style of Connee Boswell. She won first prize.         Around this time, she also caught the attention of Chick Webb, the band leader and drummer, who was reluctant to sign her to a contract because she was  gawky and unkempt, a "diamond in the rough," as the band leader Mario Bauza later remembered. But the audience's reaction to her performances persuaded him  to offer her a job, and during the Webb band's residency at the Savoy Ballroom in Harlem her reputation blossomed.         "I thought my singing was pretty much hollering," she recalled many years later, "but Webb didn't."         A Novelty Song Made Her a Star         Miss Fitzgerald made her first recording in 1935 ("Love and Kisses," with Chick Webb), and had her first hit with "A-Tisket, A-Tasket," a song she helped  write, adapting the lyric, she later explained, from "that old drop-the-handkerchief game I played from 6 to 7 years old on up." The record became a popular sensation and made her a star. After Webb died in 1939, the young singer was the band's nominal leader until mid-1942, when it broke up. Between her recording debut in 1935 and the demise of the band seven years later, Miss Fitzgerald recorded almost 150 sides, the majority of them novelties and disposable pop fluff.         During this period, she married Benjamin Kornegay, a shipyard worker and petty thief with a criminal record. The marriage ended in annulment after two years. The singer was 30 when she fell in love with the bassist Ray Brown while  they were on tour with Dizzy Gillespie's band. They were married in December 1947, set up housekeeping in East Elmhurst, Queens, and adopted the son of Miss  Fitzgerald's half-sister, Frances. They named the boy Ray Jr. While Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on her career, her son was cared for by her aunt Virginia.         The marriage eventually became a casualty of conflicting career schedules, and the couple were divorced in 1953, although they continued to work together.  In 1957, there were reports in the Scandinavian press that she had secretly married Thor Einar Larsen, a Norwegian impresario. Miss Fitzgerald is survived by Ray Brown Jr. and a grandchild.         As early as 1942 and 43, Miss Fitzgerald began to be influenced by the experiments of such be-bop instrumentalists as Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie. She incorporated elements of be-bop rhythm and harmony into her singing, and while on tour with the Gillespie band in 1946 she embraced the music wholeheartedly.         A year earlier, she had recorded what would become one of the most influential vocal jazz records of the decade, a version of "Flying Home" in which she indulged extensively in the phonetic improvisation known as scat. Where other singers, most notably Louis Armstrong, had tried similar improvisation, no one before Miss Fitzgerald employed the technique with such dazzling inventiveness.         Two years later, when Decca released her sensational be-bop version of "Lady  Be Good," Downbeat magazine proclaimed her "as great a master of bop as she has  been of swing."         These achievements were among the high points of a recording career that found Miss Fitzgerald recording in all manner of pop settings. Between 1935 and  1955 she recorded for Decca Records. Under the commercially astute supervision of the producer Milt Gabler, she was teamed with the vocal group the Ink Spots for several hits, including the million-selling "I'm Making Believe" and "Into Each Life Some Rain Must Fall." She also scored commercially with novelty duets  recorded with Louis Jordan, the most popular of which was "Stone Cold Dead in the Market."         A Huge Change Of Direction         Dictated largely by the fads of the moment, Miss Fitzgerald's pre-1955 pop recording career was an artistically mixed bag and stood distinct from her work  as a swing and jazz singer in nightclubs. One of the artistic high points of the Decca years was a 10-inch long-playing record, "Ella Sings Gershwin," which she  recorded with the pianist Ellis Larkins in 1950.         Miss Fitzgerald's life changed when Norman Granz, the impresario of the popular Jazz at the Philharmonic series, invited her to join the touring jam sessions in 1949 and later became her manager. One of her most popular numbers,  "How High the Moon," evolved into the unofficial signature tune of the series.         Their relationship quickly developed into one of the most productive artist-manager partnerships in the history of jazz. When Miss Fitzgerald's contract with Decca expired, she became the first artist Mr. Granz signed to his new Verve label. It was under his supervision that she undertook the series of landmark "Songbook" albums that brought her voice to a large nonjazz audience.         "I had gotten to the point where I was only singing be-bop," she later recalled. "I thought be-bop was 'it,' and that all I had to do was go someplace  and sing bop. But it finally got to the point where I had no place to sing. I realized then that there was more to music than bop. Norman came along, and he felt that I should do other things, so he produced 'The Cole Porter Songbook' with me. It was a turning point in my life."         "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Cole Porter Songbook" became the prototype for a series of anthologies recorded over more than a decade and focusing on individual composers or composing teams, blending familiar standards and lesser-known, usually first-rate songs.         Backed by various studio orchestras, she also interpreted the work of Irving  Berlin, Harold Arlen, Duke Ellington, the Gershwins, Jerome Kern, Johnny Mercer  and Rodgers and Hart. "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the George and Ira Gershwin Songbook," a 53-song, 5-LP collection recorded with the arranger and conductor Nelson Riddle in 1959, is widely regarded as the greatest of the collections.         These albums were among the first pop records to devote such serious attention to individual songwriters, and they were instrumental in establishing  the pop album as a vehicle for serious musical exploration.         From 1956 through the mid-1960's, Miss Fitzgerald concentrated on material that was almost consistently commensurate with her artistry, and her career soared. She made her first feature-film appearance in "Pete Kelly's Blues," in 1955, and in 1957 presented her own concert at the Hollywood Bowl. In April 1958 she gave a Carnegie Hall concert with Duke Ellington to celebrate the release of her four-disk set, "Ella Fitzgerald Sings the Duke Ellington Songbook."         A workhorse who toured from 40 to 45 weeks of each year, Miss Fitzgerald showed the first signs of fatigue when she nearly collapsed on the stage during a concert in Munich in 1965. Five years earlier, Mr. Granz had sold Verve records to MGM, and when her contract came up for renewal in 1966, she was not re-signed to the label, but Mr. Granz moved her to Capitol, where her producer,  Dave Dexter, promised to give her "a totally different sound." These albums, which included a religious record, an album of country music and a Christmas collection, found her groping insecurely for a new pop identity.         Signed briefly to Reprise Records, Miss Fitzgerald tried singing contemporary hits by the Beatles, Burt Bacharach and Marvin Gaye, but rock and soul proved almost as uncongenial to her style as had country.         Basie, Sinatra And Symphonies         She returned to jazz full time when Mr. Granz founded his label Pablo in 1973. Among her many Pablo recordings are four duet albums with the guitarist Joe Pass, made from 1973 to 1986, and another songbook album devoted to the music of Antonio Carlos Jobim. She also began performing regularly with symphony orchestras, and in 1974 she teamed with Frank Sinatra and Count Basie for a two-week concert engagement at the Uris Theater in New York that grossed more than a million dollars.         From the early 1970's, Miss Fitzgerald began to have eyesight problems complicated by diabetes, and in 1986 she had heart surgery, but she returned to  the concert stage the next year. Despite ill health, she continued to perform at least once month into the early 1990's. Although her quality of voice slowly deteriorated from the early 1970's, even at the end of her career, her singing retained a remarkable rhythmic acuity.         Offstage, Miss Fitzgerald lived a quiet, self-protective life in a 13-room house in Beverly Hills. Her social life involved a small circle of old friends,  including members of the Count Basie and Duke Ellington orchestras, and other singers, including over the years Carmen McRae, Sarah Vaughan and Peggy Lee.         A model of abstemious self-discipline, she shunned cigarettes and liquor. She was also a person of few words. Shy and extremely sensitive to criticism, she preferred to let Mr. Granz do most of the talking for her.         Asked once how she felt about being "a legend," she replied: "I don't think I noticed it at first. But when Norman Granz and I began recording the 'Songbook'  series in the mid-50's, it just seemed that more people began to like my singing. The awards I started winning didn't make me feel important, but they made me realize people loved me. And then kids started calling me 'Ella' -- half of them never even mentioned 'Ella Fitzgerald' -- just 'Ella.' "         She amassed countless awards and commendations, including honorary doctorates at Yale and Dartmouth, the National Medal of Arts, and 13 Grammy Awards, including one in 1967 for Lifetime Achievement. In 1979 she was given a Kennedy  Center Award for her lifetime in the performing arts.         Accepting an honorary doctorate of music at Yale, she commented with her characteristic modesty, "Not bad for someone who only studied music to get that  half-credit in high school."         Fitzgerald for Home Listening         Ella Fitzgerald was one of the most prolific recording artists in jazz. These are some of her best albums:         "Ella Fitzgerald: 75th-Birthday Celebration" (Decca Jazz). A two-disk, 39-song collection, it includes the cream of the singer's pop output recorded for Decca between 1938 and 1955.         "Pure Ella" (Decca Jazz). These 20 songs recorded in the 1950's with the pianist Ellis Larkins exemplify elegant simplicity and ideal teamwork.         "Ella and Louis" (Verve). In this 1956 collaboration with Louis Armstrong, two titans meet playfully.         "Like Someone in Love" (Verve). This lush collection of 19 ballads recorded in 1957 with Frank DeVol's orchestra is her most romantic album.         "Mack the Knife: The Complete Ella in Berlin" (Verve). This classic live album was recorded in 1960 when the singer was at the height of her powers.         "The Intimate Ella" (Verve). Originally released in 1960 under the title "Ella Fitzgerald Sings Songs From the Soundtrack of 'Let No Man Write My Epitaph,' " the collection of 13 ballads recorded with the pianist Paul Smith is a neglected masterpiece.         "The Complete Ella Fitzgerald Songbooks" (Verve). Taken together, these 16 disks, recorded between 1956 and 1964, constitute the singer's crowning achievement. The tributes to Cole Porter, Rodgers and Hart, Duke Ellington, Irving Berlin, George and Ira Gershwin, Harold Arlen, Jerome Kern and Johnny Mercer can also be purchased individually. Although the Cole Porter collection,  which was the first, is the most famous, it is not the best. The 53-song Gershwin album, recorded with Nelson Riddle's orchestra, is the artistic peak.         "Ella and Basie: On the Sunny Side of the Street" (Verve). A swinging powerhouse, released in 1963.         "Fitzgerald and Pass . . . Again" (Pablo). The best joint recording by two beautifully matched jazz classicists.         "Fine and Mellow" (Pablo). A wonderful swinging album from 1974, recorded with an all-star small ensemble.         Correction:  June 20, 1996, Thursday         An obituary on Sunday about Ella Fitzgerald misidentified the first feature film in which she appeared. It was "Ride 'Em Cowboy" in 1942, not "Pete Kelly's  Blues" in 1955.       
         Kathy Ahern, a former child prodigy of a golfer who turned professional while still a teen-ager, died on Saturday at her home in Phoenix. She was 47.         The cause was complications from breast cancer, family members said.         Ms. Ahern won three tournaments during her career on the Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour, including the 1972 L.P.G.A. Championship, one of the tour's four major championships. She also won the 1970 Southgate Open and the 1972 George Washington Classic.         An accomplished amateur who won the 1964 Texas Public Links Championship at the age of 15, Ms. Ahern was just 17 years old when she joined the L.P.G.A. Tour after her senior year in high school in 1967. As a senior in Dallas, she also won the Texas Amateur and the Texas Junior and was runner-up in the United States Golf Association Junior Amateur.         Before a series of injuries interrupted her playing career in the late 1970's, Ms. Ahern was regularly a factor on the tour. A good ball striker with an excellent short game, she was the runner-up in the 1971 L.P.G.A. Championship, and then won the tournament the next year at Pleasant Valley Country Club.         Although she competed rarely throughout the 1980's, Ms. Ahern remained in touch with the L.P.G.A., sometimes assisting and coaching players, or caddying on tour for her close friend, Sherri Turner.         In May of 1991, it was diagnosed that Ms. Ahern had breast cancer. She underwent a lumpectomy and a series of radiation treatments. The cancer metastasized in 1993, but Ms. Ahern remained an active supporter of the L.P.G.A., attending a tournament as recently as the first week in June.         "Kathy's courage and determination in the face of her illness is an inspiration to us all," L.P.G.A. Commissioner Jim Ritts said. "She was never deterred from showing her love of the L.P.G.A., her family and friends while she was making a lasting impact on the lives of many."         She is survived by her mother, Kay Ahern, and several sisters.       
         Faithful followers of soap operas have learned over the years that after a brief and bitter first marriage a young single mother can find love, marriage and singular professional success with a much older man, but now the question is:         Can a career woman who sacrificed her leisure to keep a nation of enthralled  housewives glued to their radios for the better part of two decades survive a heart-wrenching regimen of producing as many as 90 cliff-hanging episodes a week to live a full, rich and long life?         No need to stay tuned or wait for a toothpaste commercial. It can now be revealed that when she died in bed at her Fifth Avenue apartment on July 5, Anne Hummert, the woman widely credited with creating the radio soap opera and spinning out many of the classics of the 1930's and 40's, was a 91-year-old multimillionaire who had maintained a vigorous life almost to the end.         At a time when televised soap operas have become a postfeminist cultural sideshow, it is hard to imagine the era when "Stella Dallas," "Helen Trent," "Ma Perkins" and "Lorenzo Jones" were more than household names, and when virtually  every woman in America knew that Mary Noble was the "Backstage Wife" and were familiar with every detail of the anguished but inspiring lives of "John's Other Wife" and "Young Widow Brown."         It is even harder to imagine that all of these plus more than a dozen others  were the creations of a diminutive dynamo from Baltimore and the man she kept at bay for seven years after taking a job as his assistant at a Chicago advertising agency.         By the time she met E. Frank Hummert in 1927, the former Anne Schumacher had  lived something of a soap opera herself. A brilliant student who graduated magna cum laude from Goucher College at age 20 in 1925, she had begun her career as a  college correspondent for The Sun, then worked as a Sun reporter before going to Paris in 1926.         She became a reporter for the precursor of The International Herald Tribune her first day in the city, but within a year she had married and divorced a fellow reporter, John Ashenhurst, and was back in the United States with an infant son.         Settling in Chicago, she failed to get a newspaper job but became an assistant to Mr. Hummert, a former St. Louis newspaperman who had become a renowned copywriter and a partner in the Chicago agency Blackett, Sample & Hummert.         He was some two decades older than she and a confirmed bachelor, but then he  had never met a woman quite like his captivating 22-year-old assistant with the  tinkling voice, who was such a fount of ideas and organized efficiency that she became a vice president just two years later.         She, on the other hand, had already been married to one newspaperman, thank you, and was in no hurry to marry another. The couple didn't marry until 1934, when they began what friends recall as one of the great love matches, which lasted until Mr. Hummert's death in 1966.         At a time when commercial programming in the infant medium concentrated on working people who returned home to sit in front of their radios at night, advertisers were dimly aware that the housewives who stayed home all day were the nation's primary purchasing agents. But these women were considered too busy to pay more than cursory attention to the family radio.         The Hummerts didn't argue with the theory of the distracted housewife. They simply seized her attention and changed the pattern of her life. After "Just Plain Bill" hit the daytime airwaves in 1933, housewives arranged their work so  they would never miss an episode of the small-town barber who married above himself.         Although a short-lived 1930 program, "Painted Lives" by Irna Phillips, is regarded as the first radio soap opera, it was "Just Plain Bill," which began at night in 1932, that created the cultural juggernaut that would eventually be  nicknamed for the product that often sponsored it.         Within months the show had spawned many copycats, few as successful as those  turned out by the Hummerts themselves, who had as many as 18 separate 15-minute  serials running at a time for a total of 90 episodes a week, each ending with an unresolved crisis that was heightened for the Friday episode.         The couple, who formed their own company, Hummert Productions, and moved to New York in the mid-1930's, farmed out the writing after they had dreamed up the original idea and mapped out the initial story line. But they were deeply involved in every aspect of each production, from casting to script editing.         Mrs. Hummert, who had a photographic memory, was renowned in the industry for her ability to remember each intricate twist of every one of their creations.         It was a reflection of the grip the Hummerts had on their audience that their programs generated more than five million letters a year, and it was a measure of their commercial success that by 1939 Hummert programs accounted for more than half the advertising revenues generated by daytime radio.         The Hummerts were also well rewarded. At a time when the average doctor made  less than $5,000 a year and the average lawyer half that, they were each making  $100,000 a year from their enterprise, which included several evening musical programs, like "Waltz Time," and mysteries, including the haunting "Mr. Keen, Tracer of Lost Persons."         When television began to displace radio, the couple simply retired and enjoyed a well-traveled life of leisure. After her husband's death, Mrs. Hummert gave up their Park Avenue triplex and cut down a bit on her travels, but she continued her active life, which until a few months ago included daily three-mile walks.         Mrs. Hummert, whose son died several years ago, is survived by two granddaughters, Pamela Pigoni of Hinckley, Ill., and Anne Jeskey of Park Ridge,  Ill., and two great-grandchildren.       
         Theo Cobb Landon, the widow of Gov. Alfred M. Landon of Kansas and the mother of Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, died on Sunday at her home in Topeka. She was 97.         Mr. Landon, the Republican candidate for President in 1936, died in 1987 at the age of 100 after 57 years of marriage.         Six decades ago, Mrs. Landon drew press coverage around the country by refusing to join her husband on the hustings in his quest to unseat President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Mrs. Landon insisted that she could not campaign and also guard the privacy of her family. She had two young children to look after and, she told the press, she was needed at home.         Besides Senator Kassebaum, Mrs. Landon is survived by a son, John C.; six grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Jean Muir, whose dismissal from the television series "The Aldrich Family" in 1950 brought widespread attention to the television industry's practice of blacklisting suspected Communists, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Mesa, Ariz. She was 85.         On Aug. 27, 1950, Ms. Muir was preparing to appear in the role of Mother Aldrich in the premiere episode of "The Aldrich Family," when the show was abruptly canceled by NBC and the General Foods Corporation, the sponsor of the series. The company and the network were responding to angry telephone calls and telegrams from readers of Red Channels, a publication that had included Ms. Muir on a list of suspected Communists and Communist sympathizers in television and radio.         Ms. Muir denied the charges. "I am not a Communist, have never been one, and believe that the Communists represent a vicious and destructive force, and I am  opposed to them," she said after being dismissed from "The Aldrich Family." General Foods said it had no opinion on the accuracy of the charges against Ms.  Muir but that it had no choice but to dismiss her because the accusations made her "a controversial personality." Ms. Muir did not work in television again until 1958.         Ms. Muir was born in Suffern, N.Y., and attended schools in nearby Ridgewood, N.J. She found her way into acting by chance. Returning to the United States from France after studying French at the Sorbonne, she struck up a shipboard acquaintance with members of the English company of "Bird in Hand," which was headed to New Haven for a Broadway tryout. She agreed to become an understudy, and after acting in several stock productions, she appeared in such short-lived  Broadway shows as "The Truth Game," "Peter Ibbetson," and "Life Begins." In 1933, as one of the stars of "Saint Wench," she was spotted by a talent scout and signed to a contract at Warner Brothers, which shortened her name from Jean  Muir Fullarton.         She made more than two dozen B pictures in her four years with Warner, often  playing ingenues with a bit of flash and fire. Her films included "As the Earth  Turns," "Desirable," "Gentlemen Are Born" and "The White Cockatoo." In "A Midsummer Night's Dream," she appeared in the role of Helena. She also founded and managed a little theater company.         In 1937 she left Hollywood and, after appearing in London in J. B. Priestley's "People at Sea" and the British film "Jane Steps Out," returned to the New York theater. She toured with the Group Theater production of "Golden Boy" and performed in summer stock. In 1939 she helped organize the American Guild of Variety Artists. In a brief return to films in the early 1940's, she appeared in "The Lone Wolf Meets a Lady," "One Is Beautiful," and "The Constant  Nymph."         She found her way back into television in a drama on "Matinee Theater" on NBC in 1958. From 1966 to 1976 she taught drama at Stephens College in Columbia, Mo. After retiring, she taught briefly at several other colleges and universities, including the State University of New York at Stony Brook.         She is survived by a daughter, Margaret Bauer of Mesa, and two sons, Michael  of Los Angeles and David of Belmont, Calif.         Correction:  July 27, 1996, Saturday         An obituary of the actress Jean Muir on Thursday misstated the title of one of her films. It is "And One Was Beautiful," not "One Is Beautiful."       
         Aliki Vouyouklaki, a film actress who was the darling of towns and villages throughout Greece and who never seemed to age over a career that spanned more than four decades, died of cancer on Tuesday at the Athens Medical Center. She was 63.         Among the most popular of her 41 movies were "Aliki in the Navy," in which she played an admiral's daughter, and "Spanking From Heaven," in which she played a rebellious high school student.         In the 1960's, she married her leading man, Dimitris Papamichail. They divorced after three years.         She is survived by a son, Yannis Papamichail; her mother and two brothers.       
         Bessy Pupko, who spent 50 years locating witnesses to Nazi war crimes, died on July 26 at her home on the Upper West Side. She was 99.         She worked for the World Jewish Congress until a few years ago, searching for people willing to testify at trials in West Germany and the United States. She kept the names of Holocaust survivors on cards in endless file boxes in her midtown Manhattan office, and placed small ads in Yiddish newspapers asking witnesses to come forward.         Among the cases for which Miss Pupko found witnesses was that of Andrija Artukovic, Minister of the Interior for the Nazi puppet state of Croatia in World War II. Mr. Artukovic was extradited to what was then Yugoslavia in 1986.  He was sentenced to death for war crimes there, but died in prison in 1988 before the execution could be carried out..         "In the days before computers, she was better than computers," said Elan Steinberg, executive director of the World Jewish Congress. "She knew where everything was and where everyone was."         Miss Pupko grew up in Vilna, Lithuania, which was then part of Poland, and became a teacher at a school for Jewish children. In 1936, she immigrated to the United States, joining her two brothers. The rest of her family stayed behind.         Her father died before the war, and she lost her mother, a sister, a brother  and two nephews in the Holocaust. Her only immediate survivor is a sister, Rachela Malezin of Teaneck, N.J.       
         Doris Rosenblum, an indefatigable combatant in 40 years of struggle over housing, education and development on Manhattan's Upper West Side, died of cancer yesterday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71.         Ms. Rosenblum served for the last six years as the borough historian of Manhattan, and her positions of civic authority included her job as district manager of Community Board 7 on the Upper West Side from 1983 to 1990. But the impact of the woman who came to embody neighborhood advocacy in New York City extended far beyond that conferred by official titles.         Ruth Messinger, the Manhattan Borough President, said in an interview yesterday that ''she was and always will be remembered as the Mayor of the Upper West Side.''         Ms. Rosenblum was so deeply involved in the affairs of her neighborhood -- from the decentralization of authority over the public schools in the 1960's to the development battles of the 1980's -- that many people regarded her as an irreplaceable force.         ''She is as much a part of the West Side as the No. 2 train,'' Ronnie Eldridge, the City Council member, said when Ms. Rosenblum retired from Community Board 7 in 1990.         Born June 30, 1925, on Manhattan's Lower East Side, and raised in the South Bronx, she first engaged the political establishment of the Upper West Side when she moved there in 1959 with her husband, Paul, a printer for The New York Times and a scholar in African history.         Within months of her arrival, she began investigating conditions in her children's public school, joined and was elected president of the neighborhood branch of the United Parents Association and led a campaign for smaller schools under greater neighborhood control. That culminated in 1971 when she was part of the group that founded the first alternative high school on the Upper West Side, the West Side High School.         Ms. Rosenblum's most far-reaching impact may have been in her fight to maintain housing for low-income and middle-income people amid the massive urban renewal projects, including Mitchell-Lama apartments and public housing that  were built on the Upper West Side during the 1960's and 1970's.         ''She always wanted to make sure that urban renewal was not urban removal,'' her husband said. Ms. Rosenblum's base of influence included the Strycker's Bay Neighborhood Council, where she served as a board member and president, and later Community Board 7, where she became a member in 1971.         After 12 years as a board member, she was appointed district manager of the board in 1983, making her a central mediator, fact finder and advocate at a time when the Upper West Side was awash in huge development plans. Until 1990, when she resigned, she coordinated neighborhood opposition to several projects, including huge developments planned for the site of the New York Coliseum and Donald Trump's Riverside South property.         Ms. Rosenblum was appointed as the official historian of Manhattan -- a voluntary post -- by Ms. Messinger in 1990.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Rosenblum is survived by her mother, Fannie Koppelman of Manhattan; a daughter, Beth, of Ashland, Mass., and a brother, Frank, of Queens. Her son, Peter, was killed in an auto accident in 1981.       
         Phyllis Pearsall, who created the famous ''A to Z'' maps of London by traversing more than 3,000 miles of roads throughout the city, died on Wednesday, her business, Geographers' A-Z Map Company, said today. She was 89 years old and lived in Shoreham, England.         Mrs. Pearsall began producing her maps, which show London's labyrinth of streets from the busiest thoroughfares to the tiniest cul-de-sacs, after getting lost using a map that was 17 years old but proved to be the most up-to-date available. To get her first edition right, she often walked for 18 hours a day, rising at 5 A.M. and eventually covering some 23,000 roads.         In 1936 Mrs. Pearsall printed  10,000 copies of her maps, selling them as indefatigably as she had compiled them. She persuaded a reluctant buyer at W. H. Smith, the British bookseller, to place an order for 250 copies, promising a refund if they went unsold.         The maps were an instant success, and have sold countless millions of copies since, the favorite of visitors and Londoners alike, including the cab drivers and others whose job it is to make their way around the city.         Phyllis Isobel Gross was born in 1906, the daughter of an Irish-Italian mother and a Hungarian mapmaker. She was sent to Roedean, a fashionable girls' boarding school, but was forced to leave at age 14 when her father went bankrupt and fled to the United States. When she returned home, she said once in an interview, the door was answered by the fully  decked-out Maharajah of Patiala, who was in the midst of having his portrait painted by Alfred Orr, Phyllis's mother's lover.         ''Then mother said: 'Alfred has an artistic temperament and couldn't possibly have a little girl in the house. Get a live-in job,' '' Mrs. Pearsall related.         So Phyllis moved to Paris, where she taught English, studied philosophy and Byzantine art, and made money by painting. When she was 21, she married a 38-year-old artist and moved to Spain. After eight years  she left him because, she said, ''he was always angry and frightened.'' The couple had no children.         Returning to London and enlisting the help of her father's draftsman, Mrs. Pearsall founded the Geographer's A-Z Map Company and went to work. It wasn't easy, she said. ''I would go down one street, find three more and have no idea where I was.''         In 1965 Mrs. Pearsall turned the company into a trust to protect it from hostile takeovers. She also set up a trustee company to hold all the shares for staff members, giving up pension and dividend rights for herself, but continuing as chairman and joint managing dirctor.         Mrs. Pearsall suffered a stroke and fractured her spine and skull in a plane crash in the Netherlands in 1946, but she remained active until very late in life. She reported to work well into her 80's, arriving in a red Mercedes that she had been allowed to drive only since the age of 59, when she passed her driving test after more than 200 lessons.         Her London map business grew to include maps of all sizes, maps of other British cities, and road atlases, but Mrs. Pearsall always said that her real love was painting. In 1986 the Royal Geographical Society held an exhibition of her drawings, paintings and etchings.         Mrs. Pearsall wrote several books, including an account of her trips through Spain, a collection of short stories, a company history and a volume describing her business philosophy, in which she advocated generosity (''bonuses to everyone''), courtesy (''no aggressive selling'') and frugality (''Micawber housekeeping''). In 1986 she was made a Member of the British Empire.         Asked once by an interviewer if the doyenne of maps still got lost, she replied, ''Always, dear.''       
         Helen Wilson Nies, a former Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, which specializes in patent law, died on Wednesday, her 71st birthday, at Beebe Hospital in Lewes, Del. She lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was head injuries suffered in a bicycling accident a week earlier in Henlopen Acres, Del., the court said.         President Jimmy Carter named Judge Nies to the United States Customs and Patent Appeals Court in 1980, and President Ronald Reagan reassigned her to the Federal Circuit when that jurisdiction was established in October 1982. She became Chief Judge in June 1990, and served in that post until March 1994. She took senior status last November.         Judge Nies, a native of Birmingham, Ala., graduated from the University of Michigan in 1945 and, three years later, from Michigan Law School. She was admitted to the Michigan bar in 1948 but moved to Washington that year to work at the Justice Department.         She later was a counsel in the Office of Price Stabilization, but took eight years off in the 1950's to rear a family. Before her court appointment, she was a partner in Chicago and Washington law firms.         She is survived by her husband of 46 years, John Dirk Nies; two sons, J. Dirk, of Rockville, Md., and Eric W., of New York City; a daughter, Nancy N. Sloan of Las Vegas, Nev.; her mother, Lida Wilson of Rockville; a brother, George E. Wilson, and two grandchildren.       
         The Rev. Betita Cabrera Coty, a Nicaraguan-born evangelical minister and community leader who fasted for four weeks in an effort to end a teachers' strike in Oakland, Calif., early this year, died on Saturday at her home in Oakland. She was 50.         The cause was cancer, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Coty was with the Shiloh Christian Fellowship church in Oakland. In her two decades in Oakland, she also did organizational work to combat crime against women and other violence in the city. She was an advocate of homeless people's rights and worked with AIDS patients.         During the teachers' strike, she fasted in a tent across the street from the school district's administration building. The strikers returned to work after the board agreed, in March, to a new contract giving teachers smaller classes and a substantial raise.         She was born in Managua, Nicaragua, came to the United States in the early 1960's, graduated from Shiloh Bible College in Oakland and spent seven years in San Francisco, where she set up a street ministry, before moving to Oakland in the 1970's.         She is survived by her mother, Zaida De Unamuno of San Francisco; two children, Steve Coty of Stockton, Calif., and Lisa Hansen of Newark, Calif.; two sisters, Hedy Manthey of Delaware and Selma Hurtado of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.       
         Brenda Forbes, a character actress who gave vital support onstage to Katharine Cornell, Alfred Lunt, Lynn Fontanne and other stars during a career that lasted more than 60 years, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.         She died of cancer, said Erik A. Hanson, a friend.         Miss Forbes, who began acting with the Old Vic in 1927, made her Broadway debut with Cornell in ''The Barretts of Wimpole Street'' in 1931. She played Wilson, Elizabeth Barrett's loyal maid, which became her signature role. She toured in the play and was in the 1945 revival.         Even when her parts were small, Miss Forbes was always noticeable: an expert at accents, she created eccentric characters, many of them maids and nurses, and made them definably her own. As an Englishwoman transplanted to the United States, she was frequently called upon to act in plays by Shaw, Wilde and Noel Coward, but also played American roles.         Miss Forbes was known for her work in comedy, in musicals as well as plays. In ''Three to Make Ready,'' one of three Nancy Hamilton revues that she did on Broadway, she spoofed women shopping for shoes, learning Russian and trying to explain Wagnerian opera. As a satirist, she was compared with Beatrice Lillie and Fanny Brice.         Her career extended into the 1990's, with the movie ''The Jerky Boys'' in 1995. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1985 in ''Aren't We All?,'' a revival of the Frederick Lonsdale comedy starring Rex Harrison and Claudette Colbert. With characteristic panache, she played a clergyman's repressed wife.         Born in London in 1909, Miss Forbes came from a theatrical family: her mother, Mary Forbes, was an actress and her brother Ralph Forbes was an actor. As a teen-ager, she left England to join her mother in Hollywood and did seven plays at the Vine Street Theater. Then Guthrie McClintic cast her in ''The Barretts of Wimpole Street,'' and also asked her to play Prossy in ''Candida'' and Lady Montague in ''Romeo and Juliet.''         In ''Leading Lady,'' Tad Mosel's biography of Cornell, the author said that was McClintic's ''first brilliant, triple-threat piece of casting.''         Miss Forbes followed with a long string of Broadway plays, including ''Pride and Prejudice,'' ''Storm Over Patsy,'' ''Heartbreak House,'' ''Ring Around the Moon'' and ''Quadrille'' (with the Lunts). She also acted in ''The Reluctant Debutante,'' ''The Loves of Cass McGuire'' (with Ruth Gordon) and ''The Constant Wife'' (with Ingrid Bergman). In 1976, she played Mrs. Higgins in the Broadway revival of ''My Fair Lady.''         Her films included ''Mrs. Miniver,'' ''White Cliffs of Dover'' and ''This Above All.'' She also appeared in three television movies with Katharine Hepburn (''The Man Upstairs,'' ''Laura Lansing Slept Here'' and ''Mrs. Delafield Wants to Marry''). For many years, Miss Forbes divided her time between New York, Los Angeles and Chicago, where she acted at the Goodman Theater.         For 39 years she was married to Merrill Shepard, a Chicago lawyer who died in 1986. She is survived by 10 nieces and nephews.       
         Joanne Dru, who starred opposite John Wayne in the westerns ''Red River'' and ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' died on Tuesday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was a respiratory illness, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Dru was born in Logan, W. Va. When her father died, she moved to New York with her mother and found work as a model for the Powers agency while still a teen-ager, changing her last name from LaCock to Marshall. She danced in the chorus of ''Hold Onto Your Hats,'' Al Jolson's last Broadway show, before marrying the crooner Dick Haymes, who took her to Hollywood when he was signed for film roles.         In Hollywood, she caught the eye of the director Howard Hawks, who changed her last name to Dru. After making her screen debut in ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in 1946, she was given the role of Tess Millay in Hawks's classic western ''Red River'' (1948). In the film she makes a memorable entrance, pinned to a wagon by an arrow during an Indian attack, a crisis that is solved by Montgomery Clift.         A year later, John Ford directed her in ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' in which, as Olivia Dandridge, she turned the heads of the United States  Cavalry. After appearing in ''All the King's Men'' (1949), she teamed up with Ford again for ''Wagon Master,'' starring opposite Ben Johnson.         In the 1950's, she made many films for 20th Century Fox, including ''711 Ocean Drive,'' ''Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell,'' ''The Pride of St. Louis,'', ''Thunder Bay,'' ''Hell on Frisco Bay.'' Most were a cut or two below the films she had made just a few years earlier. In ''Sincerely Yours,'' she played Liberace's love interest, and in ''Three Ring Circus,'' a Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis film, she was cast as Martin's girlfriend.         In ''Guestward Ho!,'' a television sitcom that ran from 1960 to 1961, she played Babs Hooten, a New Yorker transplanted to a rundown dude ranch in New Mexico.         She was married three times. Her second marriage, to the actor John Ireland, whom she met on the set of ''Red River,'' ended in divorce. Her last marriage was to C. V. Wood, a businessman.         She is survived by her children,  Richard Haymes Jr. of New York City and Helen Joanna Santos of Monterey, Calif. (a daughter, Barbara Nugent Haymes, died three years ago); six grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and her brothers, Peter Marshall, the television game-show host, and David Moss of Sedona, Ariz.       
         Alvaleta Guess, an actress who appeared in the musical ''Swinging on a Star'' last season on Broadway, died on Sept. 2 at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 41 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said her mother, Gracie Guess.         Ms. Guess, a buxom woman with a strong singing voice, performed at the Tony Awards in June with the other cast members of ''Swinging on a Star,'' a revue featuring the songs of Johnny Burke.         In 1994, she was in the musical ''Avenue X'' at Playwrights Horizons. She also toured in ''Once on This Island'' and ''Ain't Misbehavin.' ''         Ms. Guess was born in Kansas City, Mo., and is survived by her mother, who lives there.       
         Bibi Besch, an actress who appeared on many of television's most popular shows and was on the board of the Screen Actors Guild, died last Saturday at the Daniel Freeman Hospital in Los Angeles. Ms. Besch, who lived in Los Angeles, was 54.         She died of cancer, said her sister-in-law, Jenny Besch of Manhattan.         Ms. Besch, a daughter of the actress Gusti Huber and the mother of the actress Samantha Mathis, appeared on such television series as ''Northern Exposure,'' ''E.R.,'' ''L.A. Law,'' ''Law and Order,'' ''Night Court,'' Family Ties,'' ''Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' ''Coach,'' ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Her performances in ''Doing Time on Maple Drive'' and on ''Northern Exposure'' won her Emmy nominations in 1992 and 1993.         Ms. Besch's film credits included ''Steel Magnolias,'' ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,'' ''Tremors,'' ''Betsy's Wedding,'' ''Who's That Girl'' and ''The Promise.'' A director of the Screen Actors Guild from 1990 until her death, Ms. Besch served on many of the organization's committees, among them the national communications committee, the women's committee, the agents relations committee and the women's health task force.         Ms. Besch was born in Vienna, came to the United States as a child and grew up in the Westchester County towns of Mount Kisco and Chappaqua.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Besch is survived by her brother, Andrew Besch of Manhattan; two sisters, Drea Gillogly of Los Angeles and Christina MacDonald of Monceaux, France, and her stepfather, Joseph Besch of Manhattan.       
         Juliet Prowse, the tall, leggy dancer with the sultry smile and the bee-sting lips who became a tabloid celebrity when she offended Khrushchev and captivated Frank Sinatra, died yesterday at her home in the Holmby Hills section of Los Angeles. She was 59 and had been a staple of Las Vegas nightclub acts, television specials and touring musicals for more than 30 years.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, a spokesman said.         Although Miss Prowse was an accomplished dancer who had been trained in classical ballet in London and South Africa and had had a successful career in Europe before being discovered in Italy by the choreographer Hermes Pan, Miss Prowse was an unknown in the United States when Mr. Pan recruited her to appear with Mr. Sinatra and Shirley Maclaine in the movie-musical ''Can-Can.''         Then came the day in 1959 when Khrushchev, the Soviet leader, visited the ''Can-Can'' set in Hollywood during a celebrated state visit to the United States and pronounced the entertainment ''immoral.''         Within hours Miss Prowse's scantily-clad image was in virtually every newspaper in America and she was being hailed by Hollywood as another Betty Grable.         Miss Prowse, who knew propaganda when she heard it translated (Khrushchev had been all smiles during the visit, she said), was nonplused. ''Let's face it,'' she said. ''the cancan is a pretty raucous number. It's not exactly 'Swan Lake.' ''         Although she won enthusiastic praise for both her acting and her dancing in ''Can-Can,'' Miss Prowse was two decades late for the era of the big Hollywood musical and she appeared in only a few, largely forgettable movies, among them, ''The Second Time Around,'' with Debbie Reynolds; ''Who Killed Teddy Bear?'' with Sal Mineo, and ''G.I. Blues,'' with Elvis Presley.         But the Khrushchev remark, a romance with Mr. Sinatra (they were engaged for six weeks in 1962) and a simultaneous fling with Mr. Presley made her an enduring darling of the gossip columns and enhanced her popularity as a television and night club performer.         Juliet Prowse, whose father was a British manager for Westinghouse who died when she was 3, was born in Bombay, India, and grew up in South Africa, where she emerged as such a skilled dancer that at 14 she was the ''baby ballerina'' star of the Festival Ballet in Johannesburg.         At 17 she was pursuing her career in London, but had to switch to modern dance when she grew too tall, 5-7, for her partners. ''When I got on my toes,'' she said, ''some of those male partners were way down there.''         A part in the London production of ''Kismet'' led to an engagement at a celebrated topless dance club in Paris, but Miss Prowse was not allowed to appear uncovered.         ''I was considered English,'' she later said. ''In those shows, nudity was the guarded right of the French and German girls.''         She later appeared in Madrid, helped form what amounted to a traveling review and was dancing in Rome when she was spotted by Mr. Pan, Fred Astaire's longtime collaborator, who was so impressed by her grace and skill that he told friends she was the best feminine dancer he had ever seen.         Miss Prowse never became a major movie star, but in the years after ''Can-Can,'' she was rarely out of work partly because, for all her gossip column celebrity, she was a hard-working, disciplined professional whose performances were almost always well received.         She made a virtual career touring in ''Mame' and won such acclaim for her Las Vegas performance in ''Sweet Charity,'' in 1966, that the show was taken to London, where Miss Prowse won the British equivalent of a Tony Award.         After she broke off her engagement with Mr. Sinatra, Miss Prowse settled down to a series of long-term relationships but generally avoided matrimony. There was a brief early marriage she never talked about, and in 1980, just after giving birth to their son, she married John McCook, an actor. They were later divorced.         To those who worked with her, Miss Prowse's most striking feature was neither her long, shapely legs nor her dancing skills, but her sunny disposition and her perpetual good cheer even in the face of one disaster or another, like the time in 1987 when she was mauled by a leopard while rehearsing for a television special called ''Circus of the Stars.''         As her longtime manager, Mark Mordoh, noted yesterday, none of her friends were surprised that Miss Prowse was convinced that the same dedication and hard work that had brought her a successful show business career would lead to a victory over her cancer, discovered in 1994.         ''Even while she was getting chemotherapy,'' Mr. Mordoh said, ''she was teaching yoga classes.''         Miss Prowse is survived by her son, Seth McCook, of Los Angeles; her mother, Phylis Polte; a brother, Dr. Clive Prowse, both of Vanderbijl Park, South Africa, and her companion, B. J. Allen.

         Dorothy Lamour, whose sarong-draped charms adorned many films of the late 1930's and 40's, especially the ''road'' pictures she made with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, died yesterday at her home in North Hollywood, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Lamour, a comely brunette who was also a favorite pinup of thousands of G.I.'s during World War II, was in her heyday at a time when the major studios believed that certain actresses needed something of a signature. Veronica Lake peered out from behind the lock of hair that invariably hid part of her face; Miss Lamour had her trademark sarong.  She wore that clinging garment in a series of films, from the 1936 ''Jungle Princess'' through such 1940's comedies as ''Road to Singapore'' and ''Road to Morocco.''         Miss Lamour appeared in seven of the road pictures, in which she was always the exotic but demure girl invariably won by a crooning Mr. Crosby at the expense of a more comedic Mr. Hope. On occasion, Miss Lamour would join Mr. Crosby in a ballad, such as ''Moonlight Becomes You'' or ''Constantly.'' By the late 1940's, her salary rose to a top of around $450,000 a movie.         But she had no illusions about either her acting or singing ability. Asked by an interviewer if she had ever studied acting or singing, she replied, ''No, can't you tell?''         During World War II, Miss Lamour was also known as ''the bond bombshell'' because of the volunteer work she did selling United States War Bonds. In tours around the country, she was credited with selling some $300 million of the bonds. So  effective was she as a saleswoman that the Government put a private railroad car at her disposal when she decided to go on a bond tour.         She received a belated citation for her bond work from the Treasury in 1965, at which time William H. Neal, at that time the director of the United States Savings Bond Division, credited her with being the first star to offer her services to sell war bonds and the originator of the successful Government plan for payroll deductions for those who wanted part of their salaries set aside for war bond purchases.         Her contributions to the war effort did not stop there. She was frequently seen at the Hollywood Canteen, the nightclub for servicemen founded by Bette Davis and John Garfield, where she spent many hours talking to and dancing with G.I.'s.         Miss Lamour was born on Dec. 10, 1914, in New Orleans as Mary Leta Dorothy Slaton, the daughter of John Watson Slaton and the former Carmen Louise La Porte. Her father was a waiter. Her mother, who soon divorced her father, worked as a waitress.         Young Dorothy never finished high school. The family finances were so desperate that when she was 15, she forged her mother's name to a document that authorized her to drop out of school.         Later, however, she did go to a secretarial school that did not require her to have a high school diploma. She regarded herself as an excellent typist and usually typed her own letters, even after she became quite wealthy.         After she won the 1931 Miss New Orleans beauty contest, she and her mother moved to Chicago, where  Miss Lamour earned $17 a week as an elevator operator for the Marshall Field department store on State Street. She had no training as a singer but was persuaded by a friend to try out for a female vocalist's spot with Herbie Kay, a band leader who  had a national radio show called ''The Yeast Foamers,'' apparently because it was sponsored by Fleischmann's Yeast.         She left Mr. Kay's group and moved to Manhattan, where Rudy Vallee, then a popular singer, helped her get a singing job at a popular night club, El Morocco. She later worked at 1 Fifth Avenue, a cabaret where she met Louis B. Mayer, the Hollywood studio chief. It was Mayer who eventually arranged for her to have a screen test, which led to her Paramount contract in 1935.         When she was at her zenith as a star, her fans suggested that an agent had adopted her last name from the French word for ''love'' as a box-office ploy. In fact, the name was close to one in the family; Miss Lamour adapted it herself from Lambour, which was the last name of her stepfather, Clarence, to whom her mother was briefly married.         Miss Lamour's more than 50 films included ''Typhoon'' (1939), ''Johnny Apollo'' (1940), ''The Fleet's In'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942), ''Duffy's Tavern'' (1945),  ''Here Comes the Groom'' (1951), ''Donovan's Reef'' (1962) and ''Pajama Party'' (1964).         The seven movies in which she appeared with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope were ''Road to Singapore (1940), ''Road to Zanzibar'' (1941), ''Road to Morocco'' (1942), ''Road to Utopia'' (1946), ''Road to Rio'' (1948) ''Road to Bali'' (1953) and ''Road to Hong Kong'' (1962). Although Miss Lamour worked closely with Mr. Hope and Crosby for many years, she said that she was not close to them personally.         Miss Lamour's first marriage, to Herbie Kay, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, William  Ross Howard 3d, in 1943 while she was on a bond tour. Mr. Howard, who had interests in the frozen food and advertising businesses, died in 1978.         After she retired from the movies, Miss Lamour remained active. In 1968, she starred in the national road show production of ''Hello, Dolly!'' And in 1969, she was named to the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore, where she then lived. She was active in various causes there for many years. In the 1980's, she worked the cabaret circuit, where she sang many of the songs she had sung in her movies.         In the 1987 film ''Creepshow 2,'' she played a sloppily dressed housewife who gets murdered. ''Well, at my age you can't lean against a palm tree and sing 'Moon of Monakoora,''' she said. ''People would look at that and say, 'What is she trying to do?' ''         While ''Creepshow 2'' was her only film role in two decades, she was frequently seen on television, doing guest shots such shows as ''The Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and, naturally, a few Bob Hope specials.         She is survived by her two sons, John Ridgley Howard and Tom Howard; a stepson, William Ross Howard 4th; a grandson, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  September 24, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Dorothy Lamour yesterday reversed parts of the name of her second husband in some copies. He was William Ross Howard 3d, not William Howard Ross 3d.

Although Miss Lamour worked closely with Mr. Hope and Mr. Crosby for many years, she said that she was not close to them personally.         Miss Lamour's first marriage, to Herbie Kay, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, William  Ross Howard 3d, in 1943 while she was on a bond tour.         After she retired from the movies, Miss Lamour remained active. In 1968, she starred in the national road show production of ''Hello, Dolly!'' And in 1969, she was named to the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore, where she then lived. She was active in various causes there for many years.         Her husband, Mr. Howard, who had interests in the frozen food and advertising businesses, died in 1978.  She is survived by her two sons from her second marriage, John Ridgley Howard and Tom Howard; a stepson, William Ross Howard 4th; a grandson, and a granddaughter.         In the 1980's, she worked the cabaret circuit, where she sang many of the songs she had sung in her movies.         In the 1987 film ''Creepshow 2,'' she played a sloppily dressed housewife who gets murdered. ''Well, at my age you can't lean against a palm tree and sing 'Moon of Monakoora,' '' she said. ''People would look at that and say, 'What is she trying to do?' ''         While ''Creepshow 2'' was her only film role in two decades, she was frequently seen on television, in guest shots on such shows as ''The Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and, naturally, a few Bob Hope specials.       
         Ludmilla Chiriaeff, the founder of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens of Montreal and a major force in Canadian dance, died on Sunday at a hospital in Montreal. She was 72.         She died of complications from a lung illness, said Catherine Luft Mead, a daughter.         Mme. Chiriaeff developed a major company in a city that knew little about ballet before her arrival there in 1952. Her earliest efforts perplexed straitlaced audiences, and a clergyman once chastised her for showing her legs in public. Mme. Chiriaeff persevered, and, in addition to building a company, she became a pioneer of dance on Canadian television and a leader of Canadian dance education.         Born in Riga, Latvia, of a Russian father and a Polish mother, Mme. Chiriaeff grew up in Berlin, where she received her first ballet lessons. She appeared with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, 1936-37, but was considered too young to remain on the company's arduous tours. She danced with the Berlin State Opera Ballet during World War II until Nazi doctors measuring her body decided that she must be Jewish (she was not) and sent her to a labor camp.         After the war she danced with companies in Switzerland, then moved to Montreal with the aid of the International Rescue Committee. Les Ballets Chiriaeff, which she founded in 1952, originally functioned as an ensemble for television, dancing on so many shows that its dancers were nicknamed ''Chiriaeff's grasshoppers,'' perpetually hopping about on the screen.         The group made its stage debut in 1955 and aroused such enthusiasm that Mme. Chiriaeff decided to transform it into a company for Canadian theaters. Renamed Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1958, it acquired an eclectic repertory and toured widely. In 1969, when he troupe danced Fernand Nault's ''Symphony of Psalms'' in a Montreal church, many local theatergoers decided that the city no longer found ballet to be morally suspect.         The following year, Mr. Nault, a French-Canadian choreographer, made Les Grands Ballets Canadiens internationally famous with his staging of ''Tommy,'' the rock-opera by the Who.         Mme. Chiriaeff founded l'Academie des Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1958 and l'Ecole Superieure de Danse in 1966, and relinquished the artistic direction of her company in 1974 to devote herself full-time to educational activities. Her many projects ranged from courses for students desiring professional careers to introductory ballet lessons for sixth graders.         Among the honors received by Mme. Chiriaeff are the Governor General's Medal of the Order of Canada, the Governor General's Award for the Performing Arts, the Denise Pelletier Award for the Performing Arts and honorary doctorates from McGill University, the University of Montreal and the University of Quebec. She was named a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1984 and an Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 1985. The City of Montreal proclaimed her a ''Grande Montrealaise (Great Montrealer)'' in 1978, and the headquarters of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens is called La Maison de la Danse Ludmilla Chiriaeff in her honor.         Mme. Chiriaeff was married twice; both marriages ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Mead, of New York City, she is survived by two other daughters, Anastasia Chiriaeff of Montreal, and Ludmilla Luft Ivanovic of Boston; two sons, Avde Chiriaeff and Gleb Chiriaeff, both of Montreal, and four granddaughters.       
         Kathleen Carlin, a social service executive who devoted her professional life to the proposition that men can learn to get along quite well without beating up their wives and girlfriends, died on Sept. 20 at a hospice near her home in Atlanta. She was 57 and had been a leading voice in the movement to stop violence against women.         Colleagues said the cause was cancer.         Ms. Carlin, a native of Maywood, Neb., who graduated from the University of Nebraska and received a master's in social work there, married right after college and began raising a family, first in Atlanta and later in Houston. She did not begin her career until the mid-1970's, when she and her family returned to Atlanta and settled there for good.         But once she got started, taking a job in suburban Atlanta as director of Georgia's first shelter for battered women, Ms. Carlin became so outraged by what she viewed as society's indifference to the problem that she was soon in the forefront of national efforts to curb domestic violence.         Although Ms. Carlin held high positions in the National Coalition Against Domestic Violence, helped found the National Women's Abuse Prevention Project and was keynote speaker at national conferences, her major contribution came as the executive director of Men Stopping Violence, an organization based in Atlanta that she helped establish in 1982.         With a $5 million annual budget, the group seeks to effect change  across the spectrum of what Ms. Carlin described as a continuum of sanctioned abuse of women. In addition to running programs of intensive behavior modification for men with a history of abusing women and training instructors to operate similar programs across the country, the organization works to change the social norms of male supremacy and control that Ms. Carlin came to see as the underlying causes of abuse.         Although the organization has shown some promise -- for example, winning contracts with the military and religious denominations to help them change their organizational cultures to take the issue seriously -- Ms. Carlin did not need to be reminded that her efforts were barely a beginning.         After all, as she was quick to point out, an estimated 3 million to 4 million women suffer some degree of physical abuse at the hands of men each year, and surveys indicate that women in two-thirds of American marriages are battered at least once by their husbands.         And Ms. Carlin, who saw physical violence as just one extreme measure men use to control women, had an answer for anyone who might suggest that in the vast majority of those marriages the violence was so rare as to be inconsequential. She would be ready with a case history to show that a single beating was often all it took for a man to establish domination.         The case involved a woman whose husband beat her severely one Thanksgiving and never laid a hand on her after that -- because he did not have to. As Ms. Carlin recalled, after that all he had to do when his wife balked at bowing to his wishes was to say ''remember Thanksgiving,'' and the terrified wife would submit.         Just as that wife had learned to conduct herself to avoid the serious consequences of displeasing her husband, Ms. Carlin felt that men would decide not to beat their wives at the exact moment that society came to regard domestic abuse as a serious criminal offense to be dealt with swiftly, surely and severely.         And that, she argued, will never happen until society abandons the notion of across-the-board male domination that tends to justify violence against women in the first place. That may be a tall order, but Ms. Carlin was not one to shrink from a challenge. In 1990, for example, she joined a group of women who scaled Mount Kenya, and for all her frustrations in trying to reform an entire society, she knew how to have a good time.         Indeed, her annual high-spirited Christmas parties made such an impression on her staff and friends that they provided an antidote of sorts to the grim ''remember Thanksgiving'' tag line of Ms. Carlin's anecdote of domestic abuse. Or, as those who vowed to continue her work might put it, ''remember Christmas.''         Ms. Carlin is survived by her husband, John; two daughters, Suzanne Rianhard of San Francisco and Elizabeth Carlin of New York; her mother, Arlene Hough of Atlanta, and a sister, Janet Allen of Dallas.       
         Martha Entenmann, the matriarch of the family that turned a small Bay Shore, L.I., bakery into Entenmann's, one of the nation's largest and best-known baked-goods companies, died yesterday at Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip, L.I. She was 89 and lived in Islip.         Mrs. Entenmann had suffered from a heart ailment in recent years and died of complications from a recent operation, her son, William 3d, said.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. Entenmann, who married the son of the bakery's founder and was the mother of three sons who operated Entenmann's for decades, took an active role in the company, keeping the books, managing the office and, after her husband died in 1951, sharing managerial decisions with her sons until her retirement 15 years ago.         When Entenmann's went public in 1976, the company's stock certificates bore the picture of Mrs. Entenmann, known as Mrs. E to hundreds of employees at the 14-acre Bay Shore plant where doughnuts, cakes, cookies and other baked goods were packed in white boxes with the blue-bannered Entenmann's label.         Born in Hoboken, N.J., in 1906, the former Martha Schneider was a 19-year-old saleswoman in a Bay Shore bakery in 1925 when she married her boss, William Entenmann Jr., whose father had founded the business in Brooklyn in 1898. Their sons, Robert, Charles and William, all eventually joined the company, which prospered with home deliveries on Long Island despite depression and war.         In the 1950's, after her husband's death, Mrs. Entenmann and her sons stopped making bread and rolls to concentrate on cakes, pies and pastries; ended home deliveries in favor of supermarket chains and grocery stores, and expanded from Long Island to Miami, Chicago and many other cities.         In 1978, Entenmann's was sold to Warner-Lambert, the pharmaceutical company, for $233 million, and in 1982 to General Foods for $315 million. In 1985, General Foods was acquired by Philip Morris, and Entenmann's became part of Kraft Foods. Last year, Entenmann's and three other Kraft brands were bought by CPC International for $865 million.         Mrs. Entenmann is survived by her three sons, Robert, of Riverhead, L.I., Charles, of Oak Beach, L.I., and William 3d, of Islip; eight grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Frances Lear, a mercurial figure in the media world who spent some $25 million she received in a divorce settlement to start a magazine named after herself, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She died of breast cancer, said Dr. Jonathan LaPook, her son-in-law.         Ms. Lear was married for 28 years to Norman Lear, the highly successful television producer of series like ''All in the Family'' and ''Maude.'' Her divorce settlement from Mr. Lear, an amount variously estimated to be between $100 million and $112 million, was one of the largest ever recorded.         ''I was very much a part of his thinking,'' she often said, justifying the amount of the settlement. ''Norman could not have done his shows without me.''         It is generally considered -- and she herself claimed -- that she was the inspiration for Maude, the feisty and opinionated title character played by Bea Arthur.         Ms. Lear made a name for herself among feminists, working in political campaigns, including Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968; with the National Organization for Women on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was not ratified; as a partner in an executive search firm specializing in placing women, and as a writer, producing articles for a number of national publications. But she believed that she had faded into the background as her husband's career took off in the 1970's. After Mr. Lear acquired his own movie studio and founded his own civil liberties group, People for the American Way, she discussed her frustrations in an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times in 1981.         A woman in Hollywood is a nonperson, she wrote, ''unless she is under 21, powerful or a star.'' She noted, too, that an industry wife was looked through, never at. In a later interview, recalling her years as a Hollywood wife, she said she had felt constantly ignored and undervalued, had had little self-esteem and had often been depressed.         Ms. Lear, in her own words, ''always aspired to something out of the ordinary,'' and she moved to New York after her divorce in 1985. She quickly set out to change the nonperson identity she had felt in Hollywood by creating Lear's, a magazine aimed at women like herself -- ''the woman who wasn't born yesterday,'' as the magazine said on its cover.         Lear's began publication in 1988 and was a success. It began with a circulation base of 250,000 and grew to 350,000 in a year. But after two years, Ms. Lear abandoned her original concept and lowered the age of the theoretical Lear's woman to over 35. Abandoning the older-age niche put the magazine into competition with other women's magazines, and its advertising never recovered from the move.         Almost immediately after the magazine's debut, Ms. Lear developed a reputation for being unpredictable and hot-tempered. She held a series of intimate lunches in her apartment during which she sought, and then usually ignored, advice for her fledgling publication. She also frequently brought up more of her personal history than most of her guests were prepared for, revealing that she had a Dickensian childhood, that doctors had determined that she was manic-depressive and had prescribed lithium for her condition, that she was an alcoholic and that she had made several suicide attempts over the years.         There ensued a revolving door of editors and writers, many of whom complained of Ms. Lear's inexperience and capricious decisions. Numerous articles were accepted and not published, and layouts were changed at the last minute. In an article in The New York Times, a staff member recalled that when Ms. Lear had been told that she could not change a quotation, she had shouted, ''It is my magazine, and I will do what I want.''         A former associate once said of her, ''She spent her life in Hollywood, where you go on your gut and you are prized for being slightly nuts.'' Ms. Lear did not deny the validity of the remark. She had lived with that behavior for many years, she said, and ''very possibly some of it rubbed off.''         Although circulation was more than 500,000 in its final months, Lear's ceased publication in March 1994. It had lost an estimated $25 million to $30 million in its six years of operation.         Ms. Lear then formed Lear Television, investing $500,000 in a video production company. The videos, which she referred to as ''television books,'' were specifically for women and dealt with subjects like personal finances and relationships. She had also just completed a book, ''Frances Lear's Guide to Work and Family in the 21st Century,'' which does not yet have a publisher.         Ms. Lear was born on July 14, 1923, at the Vanderheusen Home for Wayward Girls in Hudson, N.Y., the child of an unwed mother and an unknown father. ''The odds were stacked high against me,'' she once said. She was given the name Evelyn, but she was renamed Frances when she was adopted after 14 months in an orphanage by Aline and Herbert Loeb of Larchmont, N.Y.         ''Aline was outwardly affectionate with me for my father's sake, but she did not like me,'' Ms. Lear wrote in ''The Second Seduction,'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1992) an autobiography that pulled no punches. The slim volume laid out in harrowing detail her personal history and most intimate experiences.         The memoir related her years of sexual abuse, beginning at age 12, by the man whom her adoptive mother married after Mr. Loeb committed suicide during the Depression. She told, too, of being sent to a psychiatrist, to whom she revealed her stepfather's abuse, and of the psychiatrist's betrayal in repeating her confidences to her mother and stepfather. Her stepfather, she wrote, ''met me at the door with a kitchen knife in his hand.'' Her mother ''turned and left the room, went into her bedroom, closed the door and protected her economic hide.'' On her mother's death, her stepfather was left 90 percent of the $100,000 remaining from Mr. Loeb's insurance, Ms. Lear said.         Ms. Lear attended the Mary A. Burnham School for Girls in Northampton, Mass. In the 1940's and early 50's, she held a number of jobs, primarily in advertising and retailing in New York. She was, she never hesitated to say, dismissed from most of them for behavior like listening in on the boss's telephone conversations and drinking through lunch.         For a brief period, she was the camera girl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York. The job ended when she asked Frank Costello, the camera-shy gangster, whether he would like to have his picture taken. Her boss grabbed her under her armpits, lifted her into the air, carried her into the street, set her down, kissed her goodbye and advised her to try another line of work.         Ms. Lear had two short-lived marriages before she met Mr. Lear. Her first marriage, to Arnold Weiss, a traffic manager at the Navy Yard in Charleston, S.C., lasted less than two years. Her second marriage, to Morton Kaufman (''or Kauffman or Kaufmann -- I cannot remember how to spell my second husband's name,'' she wrote in the autobiography), was dissolved within a year. She said that he had been unfaithful, leading to her first suicide attempt and three weeks in the psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital.         ''I tried to commit suicide three times seriously and three times with minimal interest in the outcome,'' she once said.         She was 33 and a buyer for better active sportswear at Lord & Taylor when she married Mr. Lear, who was then a television writer, and moved to California. She turned down a buyer's job with a Los Angeles store and concentrated on homemaking and rearing her two daughters.         One day, she recalled, she realized that ''we had become he.'' She began to think seriously of leaving her marriage. It took her 15 years, she said, ''to work up the courage.''         ''I believe the second half of one's life is meant to be better than the first half,'' she said in an interview last year. ''It is certainly true of me.''         Ms. Lear is survived by her two daughters, Maggie Beth Lear and Kate Breckir Lear (who is married to Dr. LaPook), both of Manhattan, and two grandsons.       
         Laura La Plante, an early screen star who made the transition from silent screams to audible sobs and songs, died on Monday at the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 92.         In a career in which she appeared in some 75 films, many in the silent era, Miss La Plante was cast primarily as a comedian but demonstrated considerable dramatic range.         If a villain needed a heroine to tie to the railroad tracks in the face of an onrushing train, for example, Miss La Plante could be counted on to wriggle and squirm convincingly until the hero rescued her in the nick of time.         Perhaps her most famous role was as the heroine in the 1927 silent classic, ''The Cat and the Canary,'' still studied as the progenitor of the English manor house movie thriller, in this case with flashes of comedy.         She also became something of a footnote to Hollywood history as the first woman to sing on screen when she was actually heard singing and sobbing in the original film version of ''Show Boat,'' in 1929.         The daughter of a Missouri farmer with an ear for alliteration, Miss La Plante, who was born on a farm outside St. Louis, really was given that unlikely name at birth, almost. The original version of La Plante, her son explained yesterday, had no ''e'' at the end, but she added one, without prompting by studio executives, after friends pointed out it needed a proper feminine French ending to go with the ''La.''         At a time when movie acting was not regarded as entirely respectable, Miss La Plante, who came to Hollywood with her schoolteacher mother after her parents' divorce, got her first job on a lark, winning a role as an extra at the age of 15.         Within two years, she had won a contract from Universal and was well on her way to becoming one of the most famous women in America, appearing first in Hoot Gibson westerns and the like and then in leading roles opposite Reginald Denny, especially after the director William Seitzer persuaded her to bob and bleach her long brown hair.         She and Mr. Seitzer were married in 1926 and divorced in 1932, three months before Miss La Plante, who had been making a movie in London, married Irving Asher, a producer who had been running the Warner Brothers studio in London.         For all the bride's movie star fame, the couple were upstaged at their wedding by their official witness, Mr. Asher's pal, the former New York City Mayor, James J. Walker.         The next year, while Miss La Plante was staying at Mr. Walker's thatched-roof cottage in Surrey, the house burned to the ground, destroying all the papers and documents he had accumulated during his two years in office before resigning under a cloud in 1932.         Although there were some sniggling suggestions that the papers, at least, had been deliberately torched to hide evidence of the former Mayor's suspected corruption, Miss La Plante's son insisted that the fire had been entirely accidental. Indeed, he said, when his mother, who was ill in bed at the time and eventually had to be carried to safety out a window, was told by a maid that ''the thatch is alight, Mum,'' she shrugged off the news, thinking merely that a cozy fire had been started in the fireplace.         Miss La Plante largely retired from the screen after her marriage, making only a few movies after that while becoming a somewhat offbeat Hollywood hostess.         When friends like William Holden or Hal Wallis came to dine, Mr. Asher inevitably did the cooking, while Miss La Plante, who had learned the art in London from Somerset Maugham's wife, Syrie, wowed the guests with her stunning flower arrangements.         Miss La Plante, whose husband died in 1985, is survived by a daughter, Jill Murray of Mill Valley, Calif.; a son, Tony Asher of Los Angeles, and a grandson.         Correction:  October 22, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Laura La Plante on Thursday misspelled the surname of her first husband. He was William Seiter.       
         Magda Trocme, a French parson's wife who opened her door to a single shivering refugee in 1940 and helped inspire a movement that saved thousands of Jews and others from the Nazis in World War II, died on Oct. 10 a hospital in Paris. She was 94 and lived in Paris.         Although she was a heroine to Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Martyrs and Heroes Memorial Authority, to her dying day Mrs. Trocme could not comprehend a world that regarded it as in any way remarkable that she, her husband, and thousands of other residents of the village of Le Chambon-sur-Lignon in the plateau region of southern France had risked their lives to feed, clothe, hide and protect those who would have died without their help.         But then Mrs. Trocme was an anomaly, a free-thinking woman whose life was dedicated to the curious principle that just as food is the answer to hunger the only rational antidote to violence is nonviolence.         Mrs. Trocme owed her own prominence in the rescue movement in part to the fact that her husband, Andre Trocme, was the charismatic pacifist pastor of the French Reformed Church in Chambon, a founder of the Cevenol boarding school there and a recognized leader of the rescue effort, which has been credited with saving some 5,000 refugees, about 3,500 of them Jewish, many of them children.         But as scores of refugees who came to her own door discovered, Mrs. Trocme was more than her husband's shadow; she was a highly organized, tireless and practical woman who knew how to find food when there was no food and just which door to knock on to find room and welcome for those her own overburdened household could not accommodate.         The almost unanimous support the rescue movement enjoyed in the area around Chambon is generally attributed to the mostly Protestant peasant population's identification with the victims of persecution.         But neither her husband nor Mrs. Trocme were natives of the region. Mrs. Trocme, whose paternal grandfather was a refugee from Czarist Russia and whose father was an engineer who had been a colonel in the Italian cavalry, was born in Florence, where she had an unconventional reaction to a conventional Catholic upbringing. While a convent student, she rejected the Church and embraced Protestantism.         While studying on a scholarship at the old School of Social Work in New York in 1925, she met Mr. Trocme, a  Protestant from northern France who was studying at the Union Theological Seminary. They were married in 1926.         After his ordination, Mr. Trocme, who was something of a free-thinker himself (he had renounced violence and become a conscientious objector in World War I) was regarded as so much of a rebel in the French Protestant church that he was sent in 1934 to Chambon in southern France, a region with a long history of tolerance since the days it had become a refuge for Huguenots fleeing the purges of Catholic France.         Like her husband, Mrs. Trocme, who taught Italian at the Cevenol school, was a thoroughgoing pacifist. But many of the villagers and farmers of the region were not. Under the rule of the collaborationist Vichy Government and the later German occupation many of them took part in the Resistance activities that were common throughout France, but what set the Chambon area apart was its role as a place of refuge.         Although her open-hearted welcome to the Jewish woman who knocked on her door one snowy night in 1940 has been considered the beginning of the Chambon movement, Mrs. Trocme's daughter, Nelly Hewitt of Minneapolis, stressed yesterday that in an area where secrecy was a way of life and virtually every home eventually harbored one or more refugees, it is impossible to know whether her mother had been the first.         Mrs. Trocme's initial effort almost backfired, her daughter recalled, when she placed her visitor's soaked shoes next to the hearth to dry and they caught fire.         After the war, Mr. Trocme became the European secretary for the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an American-based pacifist group, and during the 1950's he and his wife made fund-raising tours of the United States. He later became pastor of a church in Geneva, and after his death in 1971, Mrs. Trocme retired to Paris.         There she wondered at the attention her efforts had received over the years, including a 1989 book by Philip P. Hallie, ''Lest Innocent Blood Be Shed,'' and a television documentary, ''Weapons of the Spirit.''         To her mind, at least, she had done nothing more than provide the obvious help to those in obvious need. She no more understood the fuss over her efforts to rescue Jews than the consternation she caused her neighbors  when policemen came to arrest her husband (he was later released) and she served them dinner.         ''I don't understand,'' she said. ''It was dinner time.''         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Trocme is survived by a son, Jacques, of Paris, 10 grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 9, 1996, Saturday         An obituary on Oct. 19 about Magda Trocme, a Frenchwoman who helped shield Jewish refugees from the Nazis in World War II, misspelled the name of her daughter and misstated the daughter's hometown. She is Nelly Hewett, not Hewitt, of St. Paul, not Minneapolis.       
         Ruth Lewis Farkas, who was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1973 after she and her husband, the founder of the Alexander's department stores, contributed $300,000 to President Richard M. Nixon's re-election campaign, died on Friday at the Park Avenue home of her son Robin. She was 89.         Mrs. Farkas, who lived in Palm Beach, Fla., had been staying with Mr. Farkas and his wife, Carol, a nurse, in Manhattan since her release two weeks ago from the New York University Medical Center, where she had been treated for a heart ailment.         Despite the uproar that surrounded Mrs. Farkas's appointment and a delay in her Senate confirmation, her posting caused little stir in the tiny grand duchy of Luxembourg, which was accustomed to Americans whose path to ambassadorships was paved with political contributions.         Although Senator J. William Fulbright of Arkansas cast his Foreign Relations committee vote against her and denounced her appointment as demeaning the Foreign Service, Senator Gale W. McGee of Wyoming said he was satisfied that Mrs. Farkas was innocent of any impropriety and laughed about the custom of making envoys of people who make generous campaign contributions.         ''The money -- that's par for the course,'' he said. ''It used to be a cheaper price -- but that's Nixon inflation.''         In contrast to Ambassador Perle Mesta, the Washington socialite who arrived in Luxembourg in 1949 with flamboyant ways and gala parties that inspired the Broadway musical ''Call Me Madam,'' Mrs. Farkas, who held a doctorate in sociology from Columbia University and a doctorate in education from New York University, maintained a low profile.         Reserved by nature and press-shy because of the uproar that surrounded her appointment, she was more at ease as the sponsor of forums on the drug problems of teen-agers than in being a second coming of a woman known as the hostess with the mostest.         Not until two years after Mrs. Farkas arrived did she make her first splash in the social life of Luxembourg, with a charity gala that featured the singer Sacha Distel and a United States Army orchestra. The event took in $28,000 for a school for handicapped children.         She maintained close ties with the Government, gave quiet and unpretentious parties and, unlike many envoys, avoided making political statements about United States policy. Most diplomatic work was carried out by her six-member staff, and in the Luxembourg diplomatic community, which then included 13 other ambassadors, Mrs. Farkas, though serious, was not considered a heavyweight.         President Gerald R. Ford accepted her resignation in 1976 and replaced her with Rosemary L. Ginn, a longtime Republican national committeewoman from Missouri.         Mrs. Farkas settled in Florida and resumed her many philanthropic and humanitarian activities and research into male and female roles through the Role Foundation, which she established in 1967.         Ruth Lewis, one of five children of Samuel Lewis and the former Jennie Bach, was born in Manhattan in 1906. Both her parents were in the real estate business and each influenced her. ''Community living and sharing, that was my mother; intellectual pursuits, that was my father,'' Mrs. Farkas once said.         Accompanying her mother into tenements taught her about poverty, and Mrs. Farkas never forgot her mother's advice: ''No matter what your station in life, no matter what you grow up to be, always try to  contribute to those less fortunate than you.''         She met George Farkas when she was 10. Their families lived in the same apartment house, at 107th Street and Fifth Avenue, where George, whose father had died, kept a close eye on his little sister, who was Ruth Lewis's best friend.         ''I didn't like him at first because he was such a boss,'' she said.         They were married in 1928, but not until she graduated from New York University. She received a master's degree from Columbia in 1932 and  was for many years a member of the executive committee of Alexander's.         Mr. Farkas died in 1980.         In addition to Robin, Mrs. Farkas is survived by three other sons, Alexander of Highland Park, Fla., and  Bruce and Jonathan, of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Fritz and Ingeborg Kahlenberg, exiled Germans who met during World War II as members of Hidden Camera, a Dutch Resistance group that documented the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, died this month at New York University Hospital within two weeks of each other.         The Kahlenbergs, who established Film Authors, a New York film production company after they immigrated to the United States in 1946, lived in Manhattan. Mr. Kahlenberg, 80, died on Oct. 15; Mrs. Kahlenberg, 76, died on Oct. 2.         The couple's daughter, Liz Kahlenberg Bordow, said her mother had died of lung cancer and her father of complications of kidney failure.         Working secretly, the Hidden Camera photographers, led by Mr. Kahlenberg, hoarded rationed film, snapped pictures with cameras concealed in coats or handbags, developed the photographs and, in some cases, tried to smuggle them out of the country.         Under the title ''The Illegal Camera: Photography in the Netherlands During the German Occupation, 1940-1945,'' an exhibition of 75 photographs taken by members of the Hidden Camera opened in August at the Jewish Museum, at Fifth Avenue and 92d Street, where it is to run until Dec. 1.         In addition to the persecution of the Jews, the photographs at the museum cover warfare and occupation, confiscation of goods, compulsory labor, resistance, the ''Hunger Winter'' of 1944-45 when starvation was rampant, and liberation.         One of the most widely known of the Hidden Camera photographs, taken by Cas Oorthuys and included by Edward Steichen in his collection ''The Family of Man,'' studies the face of a sunken-eyed woman gnawing on a crust of bread.         ''The pictures are painful to look at,'' Sarah Boxer wrote in her review in The New York Times.         Henry Kol, the Dutch consul for press and cultural affairs in New York, credited photographs taken by Hidden Camera with providing evidence that enabled the Dutch Government in exile to persuade the Red Cross to arrange food drops.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, who was taught by her husband to operate a camera, was also involved in resistance communications, transporting munitions and the use of forged documents.         Mr. Kahlenberg, who was born in Berlin, where his father was a founder of the U.F.A. film studio, settled in Amsterdam after Hitler came to power and was a film distributor when World War II began.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, whose maiden name was Wallheimer, was born in Bremen and moved to Amsterdam with her family in 1939.         The couple, cited by the Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, for their resistance activities, were married in 1946 and settled in New York.         For a time, Mr. Kahlenberg was a producer with Telenews, which provided newsreels to movie theaters. In the 1950's, the Kahlenbergs founded Film Authors, a production company.         They produced a wide variety of documentary and travel films for such clients as Pan American Airways, the Icelandic and Scandinavian Travel Bureaus, Holland America Lines and Bermuda. David Frost, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters were among the narrators.         In addition to their daughter, of Berkeley, Calif., they are survived by  a grandchild.         Mr. Kahlenberg is also survived by a brother, Hans Kahlenberg of Chiddingfold, England. Mrs. Kahlenberg is survived by a brother, Gunthur Wallheimer, and a sister, Helga Ekker, both of Amsterdam.       
         Arlene Wanderman, an editor and public relations executive who was the American spokeswoman for the International Olive Oil Council, died on Monday at Beth Israel North Hospital. She was 60 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause has not been determined, said Linda Russo, an associate.         In 1990, Ms. Wanderman founded Foodcom, a public relations company in Manhattan that specializes in food, wine and cooking equipment. The company's major account is the International Olive Oil Council, a nonprofit educational and promotional agency supported by the governments of many Mediterranean countries, which also set standards for olive oil.         Her career in food started at the Macfadden Group as women's service editor for such magazines as True Story, True Confessions and Photoplay. She then became the food and equipment editor of Ladies' Home Journal before embarking on a career in advertising and public relations.         Ms. Wanderman, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Cornell University and had a degree in metabolic dietetics from New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.         Her marriages to Bob Reiter of Boca Raton, Fla., and Philip L. Wanderman of White Plains, both ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, James K. Reiter of Hollywood, Fla.; her mother, Edith Rosenwasser of Boca Raton, Fla., and her brother, Stan Rosenwasser of Rehobeth Beach, Del.       
         Jessie Bernard, a sociologist whose wide-ranging research and writings on women's issues provided scholarly foundation for the modern feminist revolution, died on Oct. 6 at a nursing home in Washington. She was 93.         By rights, Dr. Bernard should have been content to observe the reawakening of feminism benignly from the far side of a long and completed career.         Indeed, when Betty Friedan revived feminist fervor with the publication of her landmark ''Feminine Mystique'' in 1963, Dr. Bernard was a 60-year-old Penn State professor a year away from retirement. And, with the exception of ''Academic Women,'' a 1961 work derived from her own experiences in academia, the dozen or so works on subjects like community organization that had gained her reputation as a respected scholar seemed remote from the suddenly urgent issues raised by the Friedan treatise.         But like many professional women of a certain age who had balanced a successful career with marriage and motherhood, Dr. Bernard came to the realization that she had been a feminist all along and, as it turned out, had a lot to say on the subject.         So much so, in fact, that within a decade after her formal retirement in 1964 she had turned out a torrent of books -- among them ''The Sex Game,'' ''The Female World,'' ''The Future of Marriage'' and ''The Future of Motherhood'' -- that established her as a premier scholar of the women's movement.         It is in part a tribute to her scholarship that many of the ideas she advanced, like the notion that marriage generally benefits men more than women, seem commonplace today.         Although her works were based on meticulous research, as a feminist scholar Dr. Bernard had an edge. For when it came to writing about women as wives, mothers and breadwinners, she had not only been there and done that, she had also done it with uncommon flair.         On the surface, she had led the most conventional of lives. The daughter of immigrant shopkeepers from Romania, Dr. Bernard, whose original name was Ravitch, was born in Minneapolis, attended the University of Minnesota, married her college sweetheart and followed her husband from job to job, serving variously as his assistant and collaborator while holding a series of lower-level jobs, and not beginning her own academic career in earnest until she was in her 40's, an age when a woman's children are generally old enough to fend for themselves.         But surfaces can be deceiving, and there was very little conventional about Dr. Bernard.         For one thing, the college sweetheart she married was not a classmate, but one of her professors, Dr. Luther Lee Bernard, a founder of the modern study of sociology and a man more than twice her age when they met in a classroom and felt such a powerful mutual attraction that neither looked back.         She then accelerated her education, graduating at 20 and receiving a master's degree the next year. After marrying her professor she began a peripatetic life, following him band from academic post to post, including a sojourn to Argentina, where she helped him with the research that would win him wide acclaim.         Dr. Bernard did not obtain her own doctorate, from Washington University in St. Louis, until she was 32, and did not begin her teaching career, at the Lindewood College for Women, near St. Louis, until she was 37.         Then, at a time when many women's children are beginning to leave home, Dr. Bernard started having children, the first when she was 39, another when she was 42 and the last when she was 47, three years after she and her husband had joined the Penn State faculty and six months before his death at the age of 69.         By the time she retired from Penn State and began writing about women's issues, Dr. Bernard knew what it meant to be both a wife and a single mother.         She moved her family to Washington and became a central figure in the feminist revolution, studying subtle forms of sex discrimination as scholar in residence for the United States Commission on Civil Rights, for example, and becoming a founding board member for the Center for Women in Policy Studies.         In her later years Dr. Bernard, who was known for her beaming smile and generosity in helping younger scholars, exerted a magnetic attraction at conferences and other gatherings, her colleagues at the center said, and was regarded by some scholars as a founding mother of sociology.         Dr. Bernard is survived by a daughter, Dorothy Jackson of Washington; two sons, Claude, of Laurel, Md., and David, of San Francisco, and two grandchildren.       
         Ruth E. Moskowitz of Brooklyn, a justice of the New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn, died on Nov. 2 at Mount Sinai Medical Center. A native and lifetime resident of Brooklyn Heights, she was 60.         Her family said the cause was scleroderma, a rheumatological disorder.         Judge Moskowitz first won election to the State Supreme Court in 1982 and was assigned to Criminal Term, Kings County. She was re-elected posthumously this month to a second 14-year term.         She received a bachelor's degree in sociology from Brooklyn College and a master's from the University of Connecticut, then joined the civil rights movement in the summer of 1961. On a mission to integrate a Jackson, Miss., lunch counter, she was arrested and charged with trespassing.         While in solitary confinement in a Mississippi state prison, she made a decision to go into law. She graduated from Brooklyn Law School in 1964 and went to work for the Legal Aid Society. She was in private practice when she first ran for Civil Court in 1976.         Over the years, she presided over many cases of Medicaid fraud and official corruption. In 1988, one of her cases produced a memorable encounter with Mayor Edward I. Koch.  At issue was the forbearance she had shown to a score of former parking-meter collectors who had pocketed thousands of dollars. Because they had no prior records, she had accepted their guilty pleas and given them sentences that involved no jail time, fines or restitution. Mayor Koch was moved to appear in person to support the demand for such penalties by the Brooklyn District Attorney, Elizabeth Holtzman.         The judge scolded the Mayor for his trouble, pointing out that he was lavishing his attention on a case involving ''little people.'' She also faulted what she called the administration's sloppy supervision.         Yes, she told the Mayor, little people become malefactors, too, but they have rights. She added that the defendants ''are going to be treated just the way the big boys are being treated,'' alluding to politically connected officials involved in recent corruption scandals. She declined to amend her decision.         Justice Moskowitz served on professional panels, in the Office of Court Administration and the New York Task Force on Women in the Courts.         She is survived by her husband, Martin Gershon; a daughter, Leah, and two sons, Joel and Robert, all of Brooklyn Heights; a sister, Anne Lyons of Manhattan, and her mother, Gussie Moskowitz, also of Brooklyn.       
         Alma Kitchell, a pioneering radio singer who became a pioneering talk show host, sang in the first televised opera and capped her career by presiding over the first television cooking show, died on Wednesday at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 103.         She was known as the Golden Voice of the Golden Age of radio, and from the time she walked into NBC's old New York station, WJZ, in 1927 and sang her way into a job, her rich contralto was rarely silent for the next two decades.         After singing regularly on the local station for a year, she moved up to NBC's old Blue network, spending two years with the NBC Opera Company and five years as the soloist on a weekly program with the NBC concert orchestra before increasing her schedule to three nights a week for a seven-year run.         By the time she abandoned broadcast singing in 1940, Miss Kitchell had embarked on a new phase of her vocal career, as the originator and host of a series of talk shows devoted to women's concerns. Her program and Mary Margaret McBride's, which ran on NBC's Red network, are regarded as the first radio talk shows.         Under names like ''Let's Talk It Over,'' ''Women's Exchange,'' and ''Alma Kitchell's Brief Case,'' in which she answered her voluminous mail, the programs were broadcast from 1938 to 1947, initially on NBC and later on ABC, the network organized in 1943 to take over NBC's Blue network.         Along the way, Miss Kitchell interviewed prominent women like Eleanor Roosevelt, discussed family and social issues and chatted about her own active life.         For all the fans she acquired as a singer, Miss Kitchell became even more famous as a talk show host, and she put her celebrity to civic use, especially during World War II. She once sang on the air while giving blood, for example, and she conceived of and popularized the slogan ''A Stamp a Day for the Man Who's Away'' to help sell war bonds.         A formidable woman on or off the air, Miss Kitchell, who had been sent on cross-country speaking tours by NBC to promote radio, became an important fund-raiser for the Republican Party in New York and was named to state commissions by Gov. Thomas E. Dewey.         A native of Superior, Wis., Miss Kitchell, whose maiden name was Hopkins, began singing locally. She studied at the Cincinnati Conservatory and came to New York in 1912 at the age of 19 to pursue a professional career.         According to family legend, she was chaperoned by her mother during her first year in New York, spent the second year on her own and in the third married her voice teacher, Charles W. Kitchell.         She began by singing with major local choral societies and orchestras, and made her debut at Town Hall in 1924 in a program that included Bach and Handel airs, Swiss and Jewish folksongs and modern French, German and Russian songs with American lyrics.         By the time she began her radio career in 1927, Miss Kitchell had already established her credentials as a broadcast pioneer. In 1917, six years before regular broadcasts were begun, she sang for an experimental station established at the base of the Statue of Liberty.         For all her devotion to music, Miss Kitchell came to love radio more. In 1937, she turned down an opportunity to join the Metropolitan Opera in order to stay in broadcasting.         Although she was primarily known for her work in radio, Miss Kitchell was a pioneer in television as well. In 1939, when RCA began the first experimental television broadcasts from its Rockefeller Center headquarters, she sang the part of Ruth, the piratical maid of all work, in the first televised opera, Gilbert and Sullivan's ''Pirates of Penzance.''         Eight years later, at the dawn of network television in 1947, Miss Kitchell abandoned her radio career and ABC to return to NBC and make television history once again, this time as the star of the first commercial network television series, also  television's first cooking show, ''In the Kelvinator Kitchen.''         She remained on the program until 1949, then retired from public life.         Miss Kitchell, whose first husband died in 1956, married Joseph Yoder, a retired chemical engineer, in 1965 and settled in Florida. Mr. Yoder died about a decade ago.         Miss Kitchell remained in vigorous health until her 100th birthday. It was an occasion noted by Willard Scott, the ''Today'' weatherman, from NBC's studios in the same building where she had helped open the television era a half-century earlier.         She is survived by two sons,  Charles Kitchell of Osterville, Mass.,  and James Kitchell of Atlanta; four grandchildren, and four great-grandhildren.       
         Meridel Le Sueur, who reported on the plight of the poor during the Depression and celebrated the free spirits of early Americans in her fiction for children, died on Nov. 14 in Hudson Memorial Hospital in Hudson, Wis. She was 96 and had lived in the hospital's residential unit in nearby St. Paul, Minn., for the last few years.         Miss Le Sueur, a native of Murray, Iowa, grew up among the radical farmer and labor groups that informed her youth, like the Populists, the Farmers Alliance and the Wobblies, the Industrial Workers of the World. Her first story was published  in a literary magazine in 1927, and she kept writing into her 90's.         Her mother and stepfather, Marion Wharton and Alfred Le Sueur, were ardent socialists who imbued her with an idealism that never left her. Just beyond their Middle Western kitchen the world was filled with  eloquent radicals: Big Bill Haywood, Eugene V. Debs, Lincoln Steffens and Emma Goldman.         Largely self-taught, Miss Le Sueur teamed with kindred souls in literary communal relationships and, sent East by her mother, moved in with Goldman while attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She came to know John Reed and met Theodore Dreiser and Edna St. Vincent Millay at Mabel Dodge's literary salon.         She won acclaim in 1927 for her story ''Persephone'' and again in 1934 for ''The Horse,'' a strange, powerful novella. With her distinctly personal style of journalism, she rendered detailed observation with a sense of political urgency. She reported on bread lines and unemployment offices and on deserted mining towns and desolate farms.         Blacklisted during the McCarthy period, she continued to write, turning out experimental prose works, novels and poems and storing them in her basement in Minnesota.         Her highly praised children's books, in which she interwove history and regional lore in poetic prose, included ''Little Brother of the Wilderness: The Story of Johnny Appleseed,'' ''Nancy Hanks of Wilderness Road: A Story of Abraham Lincoln's Mother,'' ''Sparrow Hawk'' and ''Chanticleer of Wilderness Road: A Story of Davy Crockett.''         Miss Le Sueur's own wilderness relented as collections of her prose began to appear in the 1970's. Her recovery culminated in ''Ripening: Selected Work, 1927-1980'' (Feminist Press, 1982), a clear reflection of how she had listened from childhood to the stories of immigrants and Indian women.         An early milestone in her career was ''North Star Country'' (1945), the story of how Minnesota and Wisconsin were settled. It was reprinted by the University of Nebraska Press in 1984. Her recent work included ''The Dread Road'' (1991), a novel about a mining strike in Colorado.         She is survived by two daughters, Rachel Tilsen of Hudson and Deborah Le Sueur of Graton, Calif.; 8 grandchildren; 27 great-grandchildren, and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Greer Lankton, an artist known for her flamboyant doll-like sculptures, was found dead in her apartment in Chicago last Monday. She was 38.         An autopsy will be held to determine the cause of death, said her father, William Lankton of Park Forest, Ill.         Ms. Lankton, who had a sex-change operation in 1979, was born in Flint, Mich., in 1958 and was originally named Greg Robert Lankton. She studied at the Art Institute of Chicago and received a bachelor's of fine arts from Pratt Institute in Brooklyn in 1981.         Her sculptures evolved from the dolls she had made since childhood. Beautifully sewn, with extravagant clothes, make-up and hairstyles, they were at once glamorous and grotesque and exuded intense, Expressionistic personalities that reminded some observers of Egon Schiele. They presaged many of the concerns of 90's art, including the emphasis on the body, sexuality, fashion and, in their resemblance to puppets, performance. Sometimes Ms. Lankton created elaborate settings for her figures, heightening their theatricality.         During the 1980's Ms. Lankton was part of the East Village art scene in Manhattan. She had solo shows at Civilian Warfare, a gallery on Avenue B, in 1983, '84 and '85, and was also a frequent subject of the photographer Nan Goldin. She is featured in Ms. Goldin's 1995 film ''I'll Be Your Mirror.'' Ms. Lankton moved back to Chicago in 1987, living and working in a small studio apartment filled with her figures. Last month an installation largely recreating this room, opened at the Mattress Factory, an alternative space in Pittsburgh. In 1995, Ms. Lankton's work was represented in the Biennial Exhibition at the Whitney Museum of American Art and the Venice Biennale.         In addition to her father, Ms. Lankton is survived by her mother, Lynn, also of Park Forest; a brother, Mark Alan, of Saugatuck, Mich., and a sister, Cathy, of Bellingham, Wash.       
         Eleanor Lansing Dulles, an economic specialist for the State Department who played a major part in planning the reconstruction of West Berlin in the 1950's, died on Wednesday in the Knollwood military retirement home in Washington. She was 101.         Her death was reported by The Associated Press on Friday.         Mrs. Dulles, who was sometimes called ''the Mother of Berlin'' for her enthusiastic efforts to revitalize the economy and culture of that battered capital as it recovered from World War II, managed to carve for herself a formidable reputation even though her two brothers, John Foster Dulles and Allen Welsh Dulles, held much higher rank in the American Government.         She was offered the State Department's Berlin desk in 1952, just before Foster Dulles was named Secretary of State.         She quickly saw trouble coming, she said in a memoir published in 1980, because Foster had been criticized for using his influence to get Allen the top job in the C.I.A. and wanted to avoid further accusations of nepotism. She was already a career diplomat, and her West Berlin position came through before Mr. Dulles's appointment, yet once he was in office, he tried to force her out. He did not succeed, she noted with some satisfaction.         Mrs. Dulles said it was difficult for a woman to serve in the State Department in that era.         ''This place is a real man's world if ever there was one,'' she said in 1958. ''It's riddled with prejudices. If you are a woman in Government service you just have to work 10 times as hard -- and even then it takes much skill to paddle around the various taboos. But it is fun to see how far you can get in spite of being a woman.''         Mrs. Dulles was born in Watertown, N.Y., one of five children of a Presbyterian minister and his wife. One ancestor, John Welsh, served as envoy to Britain in Rutherford B. Hayes's Administration, and her grandfather John W. Foster and an uncle, Robert Lansing, each served as Secretary of State, under Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilson, respectively.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College with a major in social sciences, worked in refugee rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in France after World War I and returned to Bryn Mawr to earn a master's degree in labor and industrial economics.         She took odd jobs in the early 1920's -- running a punch press at the American Tube & Stamping Company in Bridgeport, Conn., and working as payroll clerk for a hair net company in Long Island City, Queens.         She also traveled extensively in Europe, studied at the London School of Economics, investigated industrial methods in 75 British firms and received a master's degree from Radcliffe College and a doctorate in economics from Harvard.         In the 1930's she studied and taught economics and finance in Paris, Geneva, Basel, Boston, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Bryn Mawr. She produced scholarly books including ''The French Franc, 1914-1928,'' ''The Facts and Their Interpretation'' and ''The Bank for International Settlements at Work.'' She wrote more than a dozen books in all.         When she was 30 she met David Simon Blondheim, a philologist who, as an Orthodox Jew, was not regarded by her family as marriage material, she indicated in her memoir. She married him anyway, in 1932. In 1934, not long before the birth of their son, Dr. Blondheim committed suicide.         Mrs. Dulles, who used her maiden surname, entered Government service in 1936 as director of financial research for the Social Security Board. In 1942 she moved on to the State Department. At the Bretton Woods international monetary conference in New Hampshire in 1944, she was a prominent member of the American delegation.         The next year, she went to Vienna as the State Department's financial attache. She demonstrated keen bargaining powers -- helping to feed starving Austrians by arranging the barter of horses for German cabbages and potatoes.         Later, as special assistant to the director of the State Department's office of German affairs, Mrs. Dulles was credited with ''working miracles,'' as one biographer put it. She helped to reduce West German unemployment and increase production.         To hasten those developments, she said, she would ''send requests from Berlin for money and rush back to Washington in time to compose favorable answers.'' She wangled more than $1 billion for West Berlin, adorning it with the now-famous Congress Hall, which Berliners for many years fondly referred to as the ''Dulleseum'' and ''Frau Dulles's Hut,'' as well as a hospital and educational centers.         Beginning in 1959, Mrs. Dulles was assigned to studying foreign aid programs and visited 60 countries on behalf of the State Department's office of intelligence and research.         She left the State Department in 1962, after her brother Allen had been dismissed from the C.I.A. in the wake of the Bay of Pigs catastrophe. Leonard Mosley wrote in his 1978 book ''Dulles'' that early in 1962, during the Kennedy Administration, Secretary of State Dean Rusk summoned her and said, ''The White House has asked me to get rid of you.''         Mrs. Dulles, in her memoirs, ''Eleanor Lansing Dulles: Chances of a Lifetime,'' published in 1980, wrote affectionately of her older brothers but did not hesitate to say that since childhood there were frictions among the siblings. She also admitted that her strong personality won her her share of enemies.         She suffered from poor eyesight since childhood and developed deafness but remained active well into her old age.         Her survivors include her son, David, of Washington, and her daughter, Ann Dulles Joor, of Manlius, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Louise Bates Ames, a psychologist whose pioneering work on children held that development unfolded in discrete, predictable stages, died last Thursday at her granddaughter's home in Cincinnati. She was 88 and lived in New Haven until shortly before her death.         The cause was cancer, said Jacqueline I. Haines, director of the Gesell Institute in New Haven, which Dr. Ames helped found in 1950.         Working in the 1930's and 40's with Frances L. Ilg and Arnold Gesell, and then later at the institute named in Dr. Gesell's honor, Dr. Ames developed the thesis that ages have patterned, predictable behavior. Thus, at about 2 1/2 years old, for example, children tend to become inflexible and rigid; the result is the ''terrible 2's,'' a term they helped popularize.         The idea that children develop in stages and that parents and doctors should pay attention to them was quite important in its time, said Dr. Sidney M. Baker, who headed the institute from 1978 to 1985. ''Now we know about these things, and it doesn't seem so surprising,'' he said.         But the work was later criticized as being too inflexible and too tied to the idea that a child's development is set in stone by genetics. ''People would talk about Gesell testing as if they were saying all 4-year-olds should be the same,'' Dr. Baker said.         In reality, the researchers thought just the opposite; they used their testing and research techniques ''as a measure of individuality, not conformity,'' he said.         Dr. Ames's greatest impact, Dr. Baker said, was in educating parents and teachers about the rhythms of child development. She was a prolific writer, and her work included a syndicated newspaper column with Dr. Ilg and co-authorship of several best-selling books; among them, ''Child Behavior'' (published in 1981 and reissued by Harper Perennial in 1992) is still popular. She also developed several television series on child development, including one in the early days of television, in 1952.         Louise Bates was born in Portland, Me., and received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Maine. In 1933, she joined the  Yale Clinic of Child Development, working as Dr. Gesell's research assistant. She received her Ph.D. from Yale in 1937, studying how infants make the transition to crawling, or ''prone procession.''         When Dr. Gesell retired in 1948, the direction of the clinic changed toward a more psychoanalytic view of child development, Dr. Haines said. Dr. Ames and Dr. Ilg moved up the hill from the campus and founded the Gesell Institute, unaffiliated with the university, to continue their research.         That research consisted largely of filming children as they played or did certain tasks. Dr. Ames and the others compiled hundreds of hours of films, later studying them in minute detail.         It was cinema of a different sort that caused trouble for Dr. Ames in the mid-1980's, when she was criticized for suggesting in a newspaper interview that parents should not take young children to see the Disney film ''Bambi,'' in which the young deer's mother is killed by hunters.         ''I think this is one of any child's greatest fears, that something will happen to his mother,'' Dr. Ames said in a later interview, defending her position. She recommended that any parent who felt compelled to take a child under age 5 to see the movie should read the book to the child first, to gauge the reaction. ''And I would then wait a few days,'' she advised, ''because sometimes a child cries uncontrollably at the time, and sometimes they seem to stand something O.K. and then they start having nightmares.''         Dr. Ames's marriage to Smith Ames, a medical doctor, in the 1930's ended in divorce.         In addition to her granddaughter, Carol Haber, she is survived by a brother, Silas Bates of Philadelphia; a grandson, Clifford Chase, who lives in Ohio, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Diane Margo Morales, special assistant for families and children to the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, died on Nov. 1 at New York Hospital. She was 52 and  lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn.         She suffered a long illness, her office reported.         Ms. Morales advised Ms. Messinger on social affairs like domestic violence, homelessness and women's issues.         She graduated from City College and received a master's degree from the Hunter College School of Social Work and a master's in urban affairs from Yale University and Occidental College. Over the years, she worked for the Community Service Society, the State Department of Social Services, the city's Human Resources Administration and the Ryan Community Health Center in Manhattan.         She was a former chairwoman of Community School Board No. 3 and  was active on Community Board No. 7 on the Upper West Side, where she lived for many years. Working out of the Borough President's office, she devised and coordinated various social projects like Iris House, a center for women with AIDS.         Ms. Morales is survived by a daughter, Alexandra Morales of Brooklyn, and her mother, Nancy Salamo, and sister, Linda Salamo, both of El Cerrito, Calif. Her marriage to Charles Morales ended in divorce.       
         At 94, Brooke Astor is giving up giving away money.         After more than 30 years of overseeing a foundation that has donated $175 million in New York City, to world-renowned cultural institutions and tiny neighborhood service programs, Mrs. Astor says she wants more time to travel and write poetry. She has decided to close the Vincent Astor Foundation, and will give away its remaining $25 million by the end of next year.         While there are many larger philanthropic foundations, few have become so entwined in the fabric of the city's life, because of Mrs. Astor's role as a social arbiter and her determination to focus her efforts on New York.         She also set a standard for personal involvement in philanthropy. Determined to know every group that received money, Mrs. Astor personally visited hundreds of organizations, from the New York Public Library to a modest program that gives furniture to formerly homeless families.         That effort began when Mrs. Astor visited two families who had been homeless and had then moved into apartments in Queens with almost no furniture.         ''How can you build a new life if you don't have any furniture?'' Mrs. Astor said. ''To move into a place and just sit there with a bag and not even have a teacup is terrible.''         She mobilized a group of nonprofit agencies and foundations to support a fledgling organization called Furnish a Future, which provides furniture at low cost for such families.         Even her giving to the city's leading institutions, including $20 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an equivalent sum sum to the New York Public Library, has been characterized by a concern for individuals, those who know her say.         Most recently, the foundation gave $250,000 for a room for the staff of the new Science, Business and Industry Library on 34th Street, and just last week she gave her annual Christmas lunch for more than 1,000 employees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Vartan Gregorian, president of Brown University, who was president of the New York Public Library from 1980 to 1988, said Mrs. Astor ''has given equal attention to janitors and guards as to librarians and curators and the rich and famous.''         Shelby White, a trustee and a donor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said: ''She set the pattern for making philanthropy socially desirable. She was the model that everyone aspired to. But she did not do it to climb social ladders. After all, she was already on top.''         In an interview at the offices of the Vincent Astor Foundation on Park Avenue, Mrs. Astor, dressed in a black Valentino suit, wide-brimmed black hat and strands of pearls, said that during 1997 she would decide how to give away the rest of the money. The recipients will primarily be education oriented, Mrs. Astor said, with existing recipients getting most of the money.         ''But we're not telling anybody what we're doing,'' Mrs. Astor said, smiling mischievously. ''We don't know ourselves yet.''         As to why she chose this moment to close down the foundation, she said simply, ''Age.''         She said she had had a wonderful time running the foundation, but added: ''I don't think I can do as much as I used to, and couldn't do it as well. I would like to have one year, before I dance into my grave, of doing something good for myself.''         Mrs. Astor, who was brought up in China, said that she wanted to make one more trip there. Now that she has taken to writing poetry -- she has had two poems published in The New Yorker -- she said she hopes to spend more time writing.         Mrs. Astor said she had considered keeping the foundation going with someone else at the helm, but decided against it.         ''My son is not an Astor,'' she said, referring to her son, Tony Russell, from an earlier marriage. ''There is no family to leave it to. If you have children, like the Rockefellers did, you leave it to your children. If you have no children, I think it is a nice idea to close it.''         For his part, Mr. Russell said he supported his mother's decision, noting how difficult it would have been to take over an effort so strongly identified with her. ''I would hate to second-guess, 'Is this something that my mother would like to give to?' '' he said.         Mrs. Astor's efforts began in earnest in 1959, when her third husband, Vincent Astor, died, leaving the foundation assets of $67 million.         The decision to focus the foundation's philanthropy on New York was hers. The foundation's only mandate was ''the alleviation of human misery,'' but Mrs. Astor decided that since the Astor family money derived in part from New York City real estate, she wanted to return it to the city.         ''The mandate has been pretty straightforward,'' said Linda Gillies, the foundation's director. ''Housing, literacy, the arts and some planning and landmarks.''         From the beginning, Mrs. Astor was deeply and personally involved.  Marjory Rice, the director of Furnish a Future, said Mrs. Astor has appeared at functions for the organization and helped raise money. ''It creates a wonderful stir of excitement,'' she said. ''It is is sort of like having a wonderful magic wand.''         Another favorite cause has been the Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day High School, which lets young people who have dropped out of high school and started working  get a high school diploma. Its founder and principal, Howard Friedman, wrote to the Astor foundation in 1989 seeking money for a library. Mrs. Astor spent a day visiting the school, and since then the school has received $50,000.         ''She spent hours there,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''I got worried because it was so hot and she was going up and down the stars from room to room. She started speaking Chinese with the Chinese students. She really bonded with students. From that we developed a relationship.''         Mrs. Astor said she was struck by the students' efforts to help themselves. ''They were the sort of children who wanted to do something but did not have the proper education, and they realized that,'' she said.         The Astor foundation has been known for spreading its wealth over a wide range of causes. Of the $1.58 million the foundation gave away in 1995, 105 of the total of 111 grants were between $1,000 and $50,000.         Mrs. Astor is best known for her affiliation with the New York Public Library. During the 1980's, she resigned from the boards of Rockefeller University and the Bronx Zoo to work more intensely for the library.         Mr. Gregorian said that one approach he and Mrs. Astor settled on to raise money was to convince people that being associated with the library was good for them.         ''People don't add class to the library,'' he said. ''It was the library that added class to them. To serve the library is to service civilization, culture and democracy. It is the only institution that can be populist and elitist.''         Mrs. Astor has been able to meld the worlds of society and accomplishment in an unusually public way. Mr. Gregorian recalled that when Mrs. Astor gave a dinner for the library, she invited virtually the same people she had recently invited to a party for President Reagan.         The library's chairwoman, Elizabeth Rohatyn, said it was hard to imagine the future without Mrs. Astor's involvement. But, she said, ''With the reflection of her vast interest, the library has evolved into a very strong institution.''         The Astor foundation will close down in a year, but Mrs. Astor is unlikely to forsake her role at the center of New York life. ''I adore people,'' she said.         Correction:  December 21, 1996, Saturday         An article on Wednesday about Brooke Astor's plans to close the Vincent Astor Foundation misidentified her son, who expressed support for his mother's decision against leaving it in his hands or someone else's. He is Anthony D. Marshall, not Tony Russell.       
         Carol Robbins, a trained musician, educator and co-director of the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy at New York University, died on Dec. 12 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 54.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Clive Robbins.         She started her musical education at 8 and, by the time she finished high school, was an accomplished vocalist, church organist and accompanist. She earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in music education at the Crane School of Music at State University College in Potsdam, N.Y., and was certified as a teacher for youngsters with perceptual handicaps. She started training in music therapy in 1966 with Paul Nordoff and Dr. Robbins, founders of a creative music therapy practiced at schools in this country and Europe. Her own career began at the Little Red School House in Poughkeepsie.         After she and Dr. Robbins were married in 1975, the couple worked as a team. They developed a music curriculum for the New York State School for the Deaf in Rome, N.Y., working with severely hearing-impaired youngsters.         With Prof. Arthur Boothroyd they researched musical perception by such children as a basis for establishing techniques aimed at getting even the most profoundly deaf among them to play music.         Mrs. Robbins's vocal and keyboard skills at improvisation added versatility to their work and freedom to explore. Together, the Robbinses wrote ''Music for the Hearing Impaired and Other Special Groups: A Resource Manual and Curriculum Guide'' (MMB Music, 1980), a standard text in this specialized field.         She taught Nordoff-Robbins music therapy at institutes and schools in London, Germany and Japan and traveled worldwide to lecture and teach. She and Dr. Robbins returned to this country in 1989 to establish and direct the center at N.Y.U. within the Graduate Music Therapy Program, where it provides treatment, training and research.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Robbins is survived by a daughter, Debra Matteson of Ilion, N.Y.; her mother, Adalyn Matteson, and her siblings, Christine Phinney and David Matteson, all of Oswego.       
         Anne Schwerner, a retired New York teacher and the mother of Michael H. Schwerner, a 24-year-old civil-rights worker killed by Ku Klux Klansmen near Philadelphia, Miss., in 1964, died on Friday at a nursing home in Kettering, Ohio. A former resident of Pelham, N.Y., she was 84.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Born Anne Seigel in the Bronx, she graduated from Hunter College in biology, earned a master's degree in education at Queens College and started a teaching career in the city's public schools. She then taught at New Rochelle High School for 20 years until her retirement in 1976.         After their son's death, she and her husband, Nathan, helped raise money for groups like the Congress on Racial Equality and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, and lobbied for Federal voting-rights legislation.         Mrs. Schwerner is survived by another son, Stephen of Yellow Springs, Ohio; her brother, Morris Seigel, a resident of Florida, and two granddaughters. Nathan Schwerner, a retired wig manufacturer, died in 1991.       
         Magda Denes, a psychoanalyst who had just completed a book recounting her torment as a Jewish child hunted by the Nazis in wartime Budapest, was found dead on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62.         She apparently had suffered a heart attack or stroke, her family said yesterday through a friend, Geoffrey Weill.         Dr. Denes's second book, ''Castles Burning: A Child's Life in War,'' is to be published in January by W. W. Norton. A book party was set for Jan. 9, after which Dr. Denes was to give readings and interviews around the United States and abroad. Rights to the book, which was selected as a Literary Guild featured alternate, were also recently sold for German, British and Dutch publication.         The book recounts Dr. Denes's ordeal as one of the so-called hidden children, estimated to number from 10,000 to 100,000, who spent World War II in stables and caves and secret rooms like Anne Frank's annex in Amsterdam. Young Madga was 5 in 1939 when her father, Gyula Denes, a wealthy publisher, fled Budapest, abandoning his daughter, son and wife, who sought refuge in houses protected by Swiss diplomats.         For five months in 1944, she and her family lived in a basement, and on occasion, she wrote, she hid in a filthy bathroom and an oven.         In despair, she and her family once debated whether to commit suicide or continue to hide. Magda, then 9, cast the deciding vote for survival.         In December 1944, months before liberation by Soviet forces, her 16-year-old brother, Ivan, who had been a secret courier for the Zionist resistance group Hashomer, was caught and shot. After the war, she and her mother, grandmother and aunt fled  to France and then to Cuba before immigrating to the United States.         She was 12 before she re-encountered her father, who pronounced her a rather unpleasant child. ''I know,'' she said she replied. ''Starving for prolonged periods of time while simultaneously being fed on by packs of lice tends to corrode one's pleasanter side.''         In New York City, Ms. Denes attended City College, and she did postgraduate study in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis at Boston, Yeshiva and New York Universities. Since 1961 she had trained psychologists and psychiatrists.         At her death she was a participant in postdoctoral programs at Adelphi and New York universities. She was also a faculty member and supervisor in the psychiatry department at Mount Sinai Medical Center's School of Medicine and chairwoman of the New York State Psychological Association's Committee on Public Information.         In 1976, Dr. Denes published her first book, ''In Necessity and Sorrow: Life and Death in an Abortion Hospital,'' which a reviewer for The New York Times Book review called ''a highly emotional anti-abortion tract.'' Many other critics praised the book, and it was published in Austria, England, Germany and Japan.         Dr. Denes is survived by her mother, Margit, and two sons, Gregory Radomisli and Timothy Radomisli, both of New York City.         Interviewed along with with other childhood survivors of the Nazis in 1991, Dr. Denes said she had long struggled to break her silence. ''The hidden children are in a curious position,'' she said. ''They were not deported and they were not killed. So they never felt entitled to talk about their own experiences.         ''Holocaust survivors tend to be totally absorbed with that experience, while hidden children have tried to forget what happened to them.''       
         Mary Leakey, matriarch of the famous fossil-hunting family in Africa whose own reputation in paleoanthropology soared with discoveries of bones, stone tools and the footprints of early human ancestors, died yesterday in Nairobi, Kenya. She was 83.         Her family announced her death but did not give the cause, saying only that she died peacefully.         Over half a century, Mary Leakey labored under the hot African sun, scratching in the dirt for clues to early human physical and cultural evolution. Scientists in her field said she set the standards for documentation and excavation in paleolithic archeology. They spoke of hers as a life of enviable achievement.         ''She was one of the world's great originals,'' said Dr. Alan Walker, an anatomist at Pennsylvania State University who has long excavated fossils with the Leakey family. ''Untrained except in art, she developed techniques of excavation and descriptive archeology and did it all on her own in the middle of Africa. It was an extraordinary life.''         In a biography of the Leakey family, ''Ancestral Passions,'' published last year by Simon & Schuster, Virginia Morell characterized Mary Leakey as ''the grande dame of archeology.''         Beginning in the 1930's, Mary Leakey and her late husband, Louis, awakened the world to Africa's primary place in human origins with their spectacular discoveries and increasingly pushed back the time of those origins much earlier than had been thought. Until then, many scientists still believed the human birthplace would be found in Asia.         She discovered the skull of Proconsul africanus, an apelike ancestor of both apes and early humans that lived about 25 million years ago. In 1959, her discovery of a well-preserved skull of a hominid, a member of the extended human ancestral family, brought fame and substantial financial backing to the Leakeys. A few years later, the two Leakeys uncovered the fossils of the first known member of the genus Homo habilis, or ''able man,'' in recognition of the many stone tools found among the bones.         From then on, the name Leakey was synonymous with the study of human origins. The flamboyant Louis seemed to know just where to look to find revealing fossils; the envious spoke of ''Leakey's luck.'' Meanwhile, Mary Leakey worked in her husband's shadow, seeing to the plodding excavations and meticulous documentation of their finds.         ''Louis was always a better publicist than scientist,'' said E. Barton Worthington, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London and former African explorer. ''Mary was the real fossil hunter.''         After Louis Leakey's death in 1972, Mary Leakey overcame some of her natural shyness to assume direction of the family fossil enterprise, which by then one of their sons, Richard, joined as an expedition leader. Her operations centered on Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli, both in Tanzania. On the arid plain of Laetoli, she made her most sensational discovery in 1978: the earliest footprints of a human ancestor.         A Playful Moment, But a Fateful One         As often happens, the discovery of the prints was made by chance -- more Leakey luck. While tossing dried elephant dung in a playful camp fight, one scientist on Mrs. Leakey's expedition fell down and saw in the gray surface some curious indentations. They were imprints of raindrops and animals, now hardened to stone and recently exposed by erosion and weathering.         After further exploration, scientists determined that the tracks were made about 3.7 million years ago. The animals had walked over volcanic ash when it was damp from rain, leaving impressions of their feet. The wet ash set like concrete and was later covered over by more ash and silt. There the tracks remained to be found by dung-throwing scientists.         It was two years before a scientist uncovered a heel print that hinted of an even more significant find. It seemed to belong to a hominid. On Aug. 2, 1978, Mrs. Leakey spent three hours examining one of the clearest of these prints. She cleaned the crevices of the print with a small brush and dental pick. All the important elements were preserved: heel, toes and arch. She appraised the print from every possible angle.         Finally, Mrs. Leakey stood up from her work, lit a cigar and announced, ''Now this really is something to put on the mantelpiece.''         She was at last sure that a hominid had left this print and a trail of prints extending more than 75 feet across the plain. Two and possibly three individuals had walked this way 3.7 million years ago: the larger one, presumably a male; the smaller one, presumably female, and an even smaller individual, perhaps their child, whose prints are sometimes superimposed on the others.         In a Footprint a Clue To Human Behavior         Somewhere along the way, as Mrs. Leakey noted, the female appeared to pause and turn to her left. She might have sensed danger, possibly from a predator or the rumble of a volcanic eruption nearby. Then she resumed her walk to the north.         ''This motion, so intensely human, transcends time,'' Mrs. Leakey wrote in the National Geographic magazine. ''A remote ancestor -- just as you or I -- experienced a moment of doubt.''         These evocative footprints are the earliest known traces of human behavior. At the time, the discovery established that human ancestors had begun walking upright much earlier than previously thought, long before the evolution of larger brains. Whether upright walking preceded the larger brain, or vice versa, was still a much-debated issue among scholars.         With the discovery of a species called Australopithecus afarensis, based on the famous Lucy skeleton, the most likely identity of these prehistoric strollers was established. The species lived between 3.9 million and 3 million years ago, and from the fossils paleontologists have determined that they were as capable of walking upright as modern humans.         ''I think it's the most important find in view of human evolution,'' Mrs. Leakey was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in an interview in September. ''I was really looking for tools, but we never found any at the site.''         In Stone Age Art, Two Interests Merged         She also looked back fondly on what she called another highlight of her career. She was a budding artist before she met and later married Mr. Leakey, when she turned to fossil hunting and archeology. In 1951, her two interests merged briefly.         Mrs. Leakey recorded on drawing paper some 1,600 of the thousands of late Stone Age paintings in the Kondoa-Irangi region of Tanzania. The work gave her ''a great sense of happiness and well-being,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''Disclosing the Past,'' published in 1984, because the drawings afforded a glimpse of the lives of the hunter-gatherers who painted them. ''No amounts of stone and bone could yield the kinds of information that the paintings gave so freely,'' she said.         One of her last books was a collection of these Stone Age drawings, entitled ''Africa's Vanishing Art: the Rock Paintings of Tanzania'' and published in 1983.         Art and, to some extent, prehistory were part of Mary Leakey's heritage. She was born Mary Douglas Nicol on Feb. 6, 1913 in London. Her father, Erskine Nicol, was a prolific and fairly successful landscape painter, as was his father before him. Her mother, Cecilia Marion Frere, was a descendant of John Frere, a British prehistorian who in 1797 first recognized Stone Age flint implements as primitive tools and weapons.         After World War I, the family spent months each year in Switzerland, France or Italy, where the father painted and took Mary to archeological ruins and the caves painted by Cro-Magnon hunters. As she said, this was the source of her early interest in archeology.         ''Basically, I have been compelled by curiosity,'' she wrote in her autobiography. But formal education was not for her.         Bored by class work and her fellow students, Mary was expelled from two schools and so, with attending a university out of the question, decided to pursue independent studies in drawing and archeology. ''I had never passed a single school exam, and clearly never would,'' she wrote.         At the age of 20, Mary Nicol, a sometime illustrator of stone tools and occasional participant in archeological digs, met Louis Leakey, 10 years her senior, married and an established figure in African archeology with a position at Cambridge University. He asked her to help him with drawings for a book, and she readily agreed. A romance followed, and then scandal.         Scandal in Cambridge Led to Magic of Africa         They would marry as soon as his divorce came through. Meanwhile, they did nothing to conceal the intimacy of their relationship, living together for more than a year in a cottage near Cambridge. This eventually cost him his post at Cambridge, the memory of which was dancing lightly through Mary Leakey's mind years later as she walked up the aisle at Cambridge to receive an honorary doctorate degree.         The two were married in 1936 and set out for Africa, where he had grown up as the son of British missionaries. As Mrs. Leakey wrote later, she was never the same again after ''Africa had cast its spell'' on her. Much of their marriage was spent at dig sites. ''Given the chance, I'd rather be in a tent than in a house,'' she said in a recent interview with Associated Press.         It was a discovery by the Leakeys in 1959 that, according to Dr. F. Clark Howell of the University of California at Berkeley, marked ''the beginnings of paleoanthropology in a modern sense.'' The pace of exploration quickened. Geologists and anatomists joined the quest, a multidisciplinary approach that the Leakeys did much to promote.         On a July day in 1959, as Louis lay ill in camp, Mary stumbled on some teeth and part of a jaw on a slope of Olduvai Gorge. Rushing back to her husband, she exclaimed, ''I've found him -- found our man.''         How the couple celebrated is not recorded. But in her autobiography, Mrs. Leakey wrote that after an earlier major find they ''cast aside care'' and that was how their son Philip ''came to join our family.''         The 1959 discovery turned out to be a 1.8 million-year-old fossil known as the ''nutcracker man'' because of its huge jaws and molar teeth. It was later designated Australopithecus boisei.         As Two Lives Diverged, A New Independence         From 1968 until Louis Leakey's death in 1972, he and Mary Leakey were separated. He spent more and more of his time in the celebrity whirl, raising money and lecturing,  while she stuck to her digging at Olduvai. She was becoming more independent, opposing some of her husband's more sensational interpretations of discoveries.         ''I ended by losing my professional respect for Louis; and it had been very great indeed,'' she wrote. ''Once that was so I was no longer able to offer the concurrence and unquestioning adulation he now seemed to demand.''         Another unsettling episode in her life was the controversy between her and Richard Leakey, on one side, and Dr. Donald C. Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy, on the other. She insisted on the removal of her name from the joint authorship of a paper that made assumptions about the place of the Lucy species human evolution.         Mrs. Leakey retired from fieldwork in 1983, still smoking small Cuban cigars and accompanied by her beloved Dalmatians. Her honors were many for a woman who never finished high school: medals from the National Geographic Society, the Geological Society of London and the Royal Swedish Academy and many honorary degrees.         She is survived by her three sons, Jonathan, Richard and Philip, all of Kenya, and by 10 grandchildren.       
         Marjory Banks Grannis, a lecturer and community volunteer, died last Saturday at her home in Lake Bluff, Ill. She was 80 and also had a summer home in Edgartown, Mass.         Mrs. Grannis was the mother of the New York State Assemblyman Alexander B. (Pete) Grannis, who represents the Upper East Side. She grew up in New York City and Suffern, N.Y., and attended art school in Florence.         In 1991, she helped write and publish ''Visiting the Midwest Historical Preservation Sites,'' a guide to towns of historical and architectural interest within a day's drive of Chicago. For many years she was active in the English-Speaking Union of the United States, serving on the national board of governors and as president of the Chicago branch.         She worked with the Junior Leagues of New York, Chicago and Birmingham, Mich., where was president. As a member of the Colonial Dames of America, she helped refurbish Widow Clark House, Chicago's oldest standing house, which is now a museum.         Besides Assemblyman Grannis, she is survived by her husband of 56 years, Uri Balcom Grannis; two other sons, Uri B. 3d, of Petoskey, Mich., and Jonathan G., of Winnetka, Ill.; a sister, Elspeth B. Furlaud of New York City, six grandchildren and a step-grandson.       
         Barbara Jordan, the black Congresswoman and scholar who stirred the nation with her Churchillian denunciations of the Watergate abuses of President Richard M. Nixon, died today in her home state of Texas at the age of 59.         Afflicted with multiple sclerosis, Ms. Jordan died from viral pneumonia as a  complication of leukemia, according to officials of the University of Texas in Austin, where she taught.         Ms. Jordan, the first black elected to Congress from Texas after Reconstruction, retired from the House in 1979 after three terms to teach political ethics at the university's Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs, never losing her potent talent for public speaking even from the confines of a wheelchair.         Most recently, her rich, impassioned voice was heard once more in Congress when, as chairwoman of the Commission on Immigration Reform, she spoke out last  year against a proposal to deny automatic citizenship to the children of illegal immigrants born in this country. "To deny birthright citizenship would derail this engine of American liberty," she warned with the same eloquence that mesmerized her American audience on July 25, 1974, when Representative Jordan argued for the impeachment of President Nixon.         Ms. Jordan, whom her students recalled as never being without a copy of the Constitution in her purse, rooted that Watergate speech in her faith in the Constitution's promise and in her personal history as a child of the Jim Crow South.         "I felt somehow for many years that George Washington and Alexander Hamilton  just left me out by mistake," she declared, catching the nation's attention with measured, sepulchral oratory from her seat on the House Judiciary Committee. "But through the process of amendment, interpretation and court decision I have  finally been included in 'We, the people.' "         Then, with a smoldering glance across the proceedings of the historic Constitutional crisis, Ms. Jordan added, "My faith in the Constitution is whole, it is complete, it is total, and I am not going to sit here and be an idle spectator to the diminution, the subversion, the destruction of the Constitution."         Ms. Jordan was one of American politics' pioneer black women. In 1966, she was elected as the first black state Senator in Texas, and went on to be the first woman and first black elected to Congress from Texas. In 1976, she was the first black woman to deliver a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention, riveting her audience on national television as she spoke magisterially from the stage at New York's Madison Square Garden.         "All blacks are militant in their guts," she told an interviewer during her first Congressional campaign. "But militancy is expressed in different ways."         As a model of the Democratic politician from the New South, Ms. Jordan was less an angry or confrontational liberal than an imposing master of the process  and its details. A consummate politician from her earliest days in the Texas Legislature, Ms. Jordan won a seat on the House Judiciary Committee though only  a freshman by importuning her political mentor and friend, former President Lyndon B. Johnson, to pull some strings.         "She proved that black is beautiful before we knew what it meant," Mr. Johnson said of her. His widow, Lady Bird Johnson, led Texans in mourning their  native daughter. "I feel a stabbing sense of loss at the passing of a good friend," Mrs. Johnson said today.         Ms. Jordan's political prowess saw her ascend to the post of Speaker pro tem  in the Texas Senate six years after having arrived there as a political oddity and an outcast.         The youngest of three sisters, Barbara Charline Jordan was born on Feb. 21, 1936, into the poverty of Houston's Fourth Ward. She attended Houston's segregated public schools and graduated magna cum laude with debating honors from the all-black Texas Southern University. Her father, Benjamin, a Baptist minister, moonlighted as a warehouse clerk to help her pay for college, where her scholarship and assertiveness were honed.         As leader of the debating team, Ms. Jordan, known as B. J. to her friends, later proudly recalled maneuvering the Harvard team to a draw. "When an all-black team ties Harvard, it wins," she said.         Ms. Jordan received a law degree in 1959 from Boston University and was soon  at practice from her family's dining-room table. Eventually, she had a second-story office above a print shop near her family's simple frame house.         "I never wanted to be run of the mill," she told Molly Ivins, the Texas writer who was a friend since 1969 and likened interviewing Ms. Jordan to "a bit like grilling God" because of the care, scholarship and booming authority of her speech.         "We were poor," Ms. Jordan said of her strict but loving upbringing. "But so  was everyone around us, so we did not notice it."         When Miss Jordan was 11, she quit her piano lessons -- a defiant act that angered her father. He told her that the only good jobs for black women were in  teaching music or in performing, and asked her what she intended to do if she could not play the piano. "I don't know," she recalled telling him, "but I'll manage somehow."         As a Congressional newcomer, Ms. Jordan served notice that she had received 80 percent of the vote and would therefore have far broader interests than the Black Caucus agenda, and would hardly be a "female chauvinist."         "You know, Barbara wasn't really that concerned about the guilt or innocence  of Nixon," said Representative Charles B. Rangel, the Manhattan Democrat who served with Ms. Jordan on the impeachment hearings. "She was most concerned that the Constitution not be distorted for political reasons."         Some of Ms. Jordan's earliest politicking was as a young lawyer when she directed one of Houston's first voter drives in support of the Kennedy-Johnson ticket in 1960. She lost her first two bids for elective office in rough-and-tumble, racism-tinged bouts. But she succeeded when state legislative  districts were finally redrawn and she became the first black of either sex to be elected to the Texas Senate since 1883.         Even amid the political turmoil of 1974, when Congresswoman Jordan contended  that the Watergate conspirings had put the nation "on the edge of repression and tyranny," the outspoken Texan still led with her optimism. During that summer of the Watergate crisis, she took care to visit the graduates of Howard University  and urge them: "Reaffirm what ought to be. Get back to the truth; that's old, but get back to it. Get back to what's honest; tell government to do that. Affirm the civil liberties of the people of this country. Do that."         Ms. Jordan is survived by her mother, Arylenne; two sisters, Bennie Creswell  and Rose Mary McGowan, and a brother-in-law, John McGowan, all of Houston.       
         Josephine Patterson Albright, who flew the mail, shot tigers in India, covered Chicago crime in journalism's colorful "Front Page" era, ran an Illinois dairy and pig farm, bred horses in Wyoming, wrote a column about her family and  helped establish a foundation for journalists, died on Monday at her home in Woodstock, Vt. She was 82.         A daughter, Alice Arlen of Manhattan, said the death was caused by complications after a stroke.         Mrs. Albright was a member of one of the most prominent families in American journalism. Her father, Joseph Medill Patterson, founded The Daily News in New York and helped found The Chicago Tribune. Her aunt, Eleanor Medill Patterson, published The Washington Times-Herald, and her older sister, Alicia Patterson, founded, published and edited Newsday.         Like Alicia, who was seven years her senior, Josephine was told by her father that journalism was not for women. Both proved him wrong.         When Josephine earned her spurs in Chicago in the early 1930's, interviewing  killers like George (Baby Face) Nelson and covering murders and the criminal courts, she worked not for her father's newspaper but for a rival paper, The Chicago Daily News, whose staff members served as models for the characters in the classic Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur comedy "The Front Page."         In "Ladies of the Press" (Harper & Brothers, 1936), Ishbel Ross wrote, "She sailed along successfully under her own steam, in spite of the professional handicap of being born into a noted newspaper family."         Josephine Patterson was born in Libertyville, Ill., on Dec. 2, 1913, and educated at the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va. Although her father disapproved of women in journalism, he did approve of women as pilots, and she got her pilot's license at the age of 16. Before her 18th birthday, she was the  youngest pilot flying the mail route between Chicago and St. Louis.         But Josephine's career as a commercial mail pilot lasted only a few months. At 18, in the midst of her debutante party, she decided to fly with Alicia to India to hunt tigers. Without telling their mother, the two young women hopscotched their way across the world, dancing every night.         When they arrived in India, Josephine, who was later to become an ardent animal rights activist and naturalist, quickly bagged a tiger.         Alicia, who was supposed to shoot the tiger, was angry. She told her sister to stay out of the next hunt. So Josephine went on the next hunt carrying only a book. She was sitting in a tree reading when a leopard bounded up behind her. Josephine threw the book and hit the leopard in the nose. Alicia finished it off.         In 1936, Josephine married Jay Frederick Reeve, a Chicago lawyer she met while covering the courts. At that time she operated a dairy and pig farm that became the Hawthorne-Melody Dairy, a major Illinois enterprise.         In the mid-1940's, after a divorce, she moved to Dubois, Wyo., bought a stallion from an Indian reservation and began raising horses.         In 1946, in Red Lodge, Mont., she married Ivan Albright, an artist of the Chicago school who was known for his realistic paintings. The couple traveled extensively, and Mrs. Albright's travels fostered her enthusiasm for geography.  Near the end of her life, she sponsored a statewide geography bee that was held  in every Vermont school district.         In 1949, Mrs. Albright returned to journalism for three years as the author of a weekly Newsday column, "Life With Junior," which chronicled her foibles and successes in rearing her four children.         In 1963, she and her husband moved to Woodstock, where she obtained a bachelor of arts degree from Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt.         Mr. Albright, whose centennial is to be observed next year with retrospectives at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, died in 1983.         After Alicia Patterson died in 1963, Mrs. Albright helped establish and became a major benefactor of the Alicia Patterson Foundation, which awards fellowships to print journalists and photographers.         Mrs. Albright was also a supporter of the Pentangle Theater in Woodstock, the River City Arts and White River Opera House in White River Junction, Vt., the Hood Museum in Hanover, N.H., and the Art Institute of Chicago. Dartmouth College named her a Lathrop Fellow in honor of her support for its arts collection.         Besides her daughter Alice, Mrs. Albright is survived by another daughter, Dinah Albright Rojek of South Woodstock, Vt.; two sons, Joseph Medill Patterson  Albright of Moscow and Adam Medill Albright of Richmond, Mass., 10 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.       
         Marcia Davenport, a biographer of Mozart and best-selling novelist, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Monterey, Calif. She was 92 and lived in Pebble Beach,  Calif.         Mrs. Davenport's last book was her autobiography, "Too Strong for Fantasy" (1967). In a review in The New York Times Book Review, Ellen Moers called it "a  compelling production" and said "the gift for old-fashioned, unadulterated romance which made several of her novels best sellers (and one a Greer Garson movie) does not fail her now." Mrs. Davenport did little writing after the 1970's.         Her best-known book is her biography "Mozart," which came out in 1932, and has been continuously in print since then, most recently from the University of  Pittsburgh Press.         When it appeared, Herbert Gorman praised it highly in The New York Times Book Review, writing that Mrs. Davenport "gives a vivid and convincing portrait of the child prodigy who developed into the man-genius, a portrait that does not romanticize Mozart too much and leaves the reader convinced of the reality of the figure with whom he has passed through a career of hard work, poverty, neglect and few (but astounding) triumphs."         Mrs. Davenport's best-known work of fiction was her best-selling 1942 novel "Valley of Decision," which covers the years 1873 to 1941 and focuses on Mary Rafferty, who comes into the lives of the Scott family of Pittsburgh, owners of the Scott Iron Works, as a maid. The book also weaves the Scotts' personal lives in with steel-industry and United States history. The book was made into a 1945 film, with the same title, starring Greer Garson and Gregory Peck.         Another of Mrs. Davenport's best-selling novels, "East Side, West Side" (1947), was one of the last works inspired and edited by Maxwell Perkins of Scribner's publishing house. The novel concerned a woman in Manhattan's high society whose marriage is threatened by her husband's infidelities. The 1949 film adaptation starred Barbara Stanwyck, James Mason and Ava Gardner.         Mrs. Davenport's first novel, "Of Lena Geyer" (1936), was recalled by one reviewer in the 1980's as a "a vivid portrayal of a great opera singer." Her last novel was "The Constant Image" (1960), which described an extramarital affair in Milan.         Her autobiography has vivid descriptions of music, even of the acoustics in Carnegie Hall years ago. In that book, she praises one particular box on the second tier at Carnegie Hall, saying "Carnegie Hall is glorious," but "nowhere else in the old house is the sonority so total, the instruments, together or individually, so brilliant and penetrating. The sound comes out of the walls and surrounds one like a cloak."         Marcia Gluck Davenport was a native New Yorker. In various biographical accounts, she refrained from giving her father's name. Her mother, Alma Gluck, rose from humble origins to fame as a soprano.         Mrs. Davenport wrote in her autobiography that her parents, whose marriage ended in divorce, "were part of the tidal wave of emigration from the Russian Pale and Eastern Europe which in a generation swept a million people, fleeing persecutions, pogroms and conscriptions, onto the shores of Manhattan Island."         Her mother later married the violinist Efrem Zimbalist. Young Marcia went to  private schools in Pennsylvania and attended Wellesley College. She was on the staff of The New Yorker from 1928 to 1931 before becoming a freelance lecturer,  music critic and commentator as well as an author.         Mrs. Davenport's first marriage, to Frank D. Clarke, ended in divorce, as did her 1929 marriage to Russell Wheeler Davenport, a novelist who became a prominent editor at Time Inc.         She is survived by a daughter, Cornelia Davenport Schwartz of Harrisville, N.H., six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Leonor Fini, an Argentine-born artist and theater designer who was as well known for her eccentric lifestyle as she was for her erotic and fantastic paintings, died on Jan. 18 in a Paris hospital. She was 87.         Miss Fini, whose father was Argentine and mother was Italian, was born in Buenos Aires on Aug. 30, 1908. While she was still a child, the family moved to  Milan, where at 17 she had her first exhibition as a painter. In 1932 she settled in Paris, where she was drawn into the Surrealist movement, quickly joining a circle of artists that included Andre Breton, Paul Eluard, Max Ernst and Giorgio de Chirico.         She always insisted on going her own way as an artist. "I could never support the dogmatic and inquisitional way that the group approached its work,"  she once said of the Surrealists. Her work was nonetheless represented at the show "Fantastic Art: Dada Surrealism" at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 1936.         Later she translated her idea of the fantastic into the female form, creating a whole population of young women in strange and exotic attires, sometimes with  their heads shaven, sometimes resembling fairies or witches, often exuding a kind of Joan of Arc mystique. The erotic memoir "The Story of O" was one of many books she illustrated.         Some of her most important work, though, was done for the theater, and included both sets and costumes. She was the designer for George Balanchine's ballet "The Crystal Palace" at the Paris Opera in 1945 and she worked at the Comedie Francaise, for Jean-Louis Barrault's theater company, and at La Scala opera house in Milan. She did the sets for plays by Jean Genet and Jean Anouilh  in the 1960's.         A very public figure with her own loyal circle of admirers, Miss Fini always  insured that she stood out in a crowd. In recent years she was frequently seen at art-show openings wearing heavy makeup, unusual clothes, wide-brim hats and ample jewelry. She never married, and filled her home with cats that she often used as models for her illustrations.       
         Karen Machover, a psychologist who developed a method of personality analysis based on an interpretation of drawings of the human figure, died on Monday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.         Like the Rorschach inkblots, the Machover test is intended to serve as a sort of screen on which people project their thoughts, anxieties and conflicts. First, the test taker is told simply to draw a person. Next, the subject draws a figure of the opposite sex. Then a personality description is prepared from an analysis of such features as the figures' size, stance and position on the page.         Mrs. Machover wrote a book on her research that is still in print, "Personality Projection in the Drawing of the Human Figure: A Method of Personality Investigation" (Charles C. Thomas, 1949).         Born in Minsk, Belarus, Mrs. Machover came to the United States in 1910 with  her mother and four sisters. She worked for many years at Bellevue Hospital and  then at Kings County Hospital, retiring in 1970. She also maintained a private practice as a psychotherapist into the mid-80's.         In addition, she taught at Brooklyn College, SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and New York University, from which she had received her master's degree in psychology. It was at N.Y.U. in the 1930's that she met Solomon Machover, a student who became her husband. He died in 1976.         Mrs. Machover is survived by a son, Robert Machover of Milford, N.J., and a grandson.       
         Lady Caroline Blackwood, a writer of wry, macabre novels and essays, and a beguiling Anglo-Irish aristocrat who married the painter Lucian Freud and the poet Robert Lowell, died yesterday in the Mayfair Hotel in Manhattan, where she  stayed the last few weeks while she was ill. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Ivana Lowell.         She published nine books and was best known and much admired in Britain. Among her works was "The Stepdaughter," a short epistolary novel about an abusive woman abandoned by her husband and left with his hideous daughter. Another novel, "The Fate of Mary Rose," was about an increasingly deranged mother's fatal obsession with her daughter's safety.         Her most recent book, "The Last of the Duchess," was an eccentric, Kafkaesque account of her vain attempt to visit the ailing Duchess of Windsor. It revolved  mostly around the Duchess's powerful lawyer, Suzanne Blum, portrayed in the book as obsessed with her client to the point of erotic fantasy.         British critics noted the "brilliant irony" and "rather brilliant bitchiness" of her writing, comparing it with the work of Muriel Spark and Iris Murdoch, among others. In her prose and in person, she exhibited a razor-sharp wit and offbeat sensibility. A dramatic woman, delicately built, intense and vulnerable, she was a famous beauty in her youth, and in later years remained striking for her extraordinary eyes, which Mr. Freud made into giant spheres in his hypnotic  portraits.         One portrait played a curious role in her life, as she related in an interview last year. During the 1950's, when she and Mr. Freud were living in Paris, "Lucian got a call out of nowhere from a mistress of Picasso's who asked  him if he could come round and paint her," she said. "The woman wanted to make Picasso jealous. Lucian very politely said maybe he could paint her portrait later, but not now because he happened to be in the midst of doing his wife's portrait."         That picture, she said, was "Girl in Bed," a work that years later also figured in the death of Robert Lowell, her third husband. Their marriage was in  tatters when, the story goes, Lowell left her in Ireland and flew to New York City. When his taxi arrived at his apartment on West 67th Street, the driver found Lowell slumped over. A doorman summoned Elizabeth Hardwick, the writer and editor, whom Lowell had left to marry Lady Caroline; she happened to live in the same apartment house. Ms. Hardwick opened the taxi door to be confronted with her former husband's corpse. He was clutching "Girl in Bed."         Lady Caroli'e moved amo'g several worlds: from the insular Anglo-Irish upper  classes, which she largely rejected for the smart set of postwar England and then for the liberal intelligentsia of New York City in the 1960's and 70's. During much of the last 35 years, she lived in the United States, splitting her time in recent years between an apartment in Manhattan and a house in Sag Harbor, L.I., that once belonged to President Chester A. Arthur.         Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood was born in London on July 16, 1931.  She was descended on her father's side from the great 18th-century dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan and was a Guinness on her mother's side. (She liked to joke that she found stout undrinkable.) She grew up in the ancestral stone mansion, Clandeboye, in County Down in Northern Ireland.         Her great-grandfather, Lord Dufferin, was an eminent Victorian rumored to have been Disraeli's illegitimate son. Queen Victoria made him Viceroy of India, where he used to sit on his throne, fanned by peacock feathers. "Kipling loved my great-grandfather and wrote lots of very bad poems to him," Lady Caroline said. "He had a fatal effect on poets."         Her mother, Maureen, the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, is a flamboyant figure in London who, according to one newspaper account, gave a black eye to Sir Oswald Mosley, the English Fascist, after he made a pass at her in Antibes.  Her father, Basil, the Marquess, was a friend of Evelyn Waugh and part of the circle described in "Brideshead Revisited." He was killed in Burma during World  War II, when Caroline was 12.         Like other women of her class, she skipped college; she moved to London and worked for Claud Cockburn, the influential left-wing journalist. She recalled meeting Mr. Freud at that time at a party memorable because the painter Francis  Bacon caused a row when he hooted down Princess Margaret, who had just started singing "Let's Do It." She and Mr. Freud then became part of the group that included Bacon, Cyril Connolly and the other artists and writers who gathered nightly to drink at the Gargoyle and Colony Clubs.         When her marriage to Mr. Freud ended in 1956, she installed herself at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. She got a tiny part in the television series "Have Gun Will Travel." Stephen Spender asked her to write an article for Encounter magazine about California beatniks, and it was ' sendup that launched  her writing career.         She next moved to New York and married Israel Citkowitz, an American composer and pianist, and a student of Aaron Copland, 20 years her senior. They were divorced in 1972, when she married Lowell, but they remained close.         During the next years she endured a series of Job-like catastrophes: the death of Citkowitz; Lowell's crippling manic depression and early death; the death from AIDS of her brother, Sheridan, to whom she was very close; the death of her eldest daughter, Natalya, after a drug overdose, and her own bout with cervical cancer, for which she had an operation that left her in constant pain.         Throughout, she maintained her dark humor and creatively transformed her experiences into her novels and essays. "I think it's partly Irish," she once explained. "Irish people are very funny but have this tragic sense.         "As Cal wrote," she added, referring to Lowell, "if there's light at the end  of the tunnel, it's the light of the oncoming train."         In addition to her daughter Ivana, of Manhattan, she is survived by her mother, of London; a sister, Lady Perdita Blackwood, of Ulster; another daughter, Evgenia Citkowitz of Los Angeles, and a son, Sheridan Lowell of Manhattan.       
         Eva Hart was 7 years old and bound for a new life in Canada when her father woke her in the middle of the night, carried her outside in a blanket and told her, "Hold Mummy's hand and be a good girl."         It was the last thing he ever said to her, and she never saw him again. Later that night, wide awake and clinging to her mother in a lifeboat, the little girl watched as the Titanic rose straight up on her bow and plunged to the bottom of  the sea, carrying her father and more than 1,500 other passengers and crew members to their deaths in the North Atlantic.         As one of only 705 Titanic passengers who survived, Eva Hart never forgot what she had seen and heard that night. When she died on Wednesday at a hospice  in London at the age of 91, she was regarded as last link of living memory with  the maritime disaster that rocked the world on April 15, 1912.         Of the eight remaining survivors, seven were too young at the time to know what was happening, according to Karen Kamuda of the Titanic Historical Society  in Springfield, Mass., and one, nearing her 100th birthday, no longer remembers.         But even during Mrs. Hart's last years, her memory remained vivid and chilling.         "I saw that ship sink," she said in a 1993 interview. "I never closed my eyes. I didn't sleep at all. I saw it, I heard it, and nobody could possibly forget it."         There have been shipwrecks with greater loss of life before and after the Titanic, but none have clamped such a chilling grip on the popular imagination.         That is partly because the Titanic was on her maiden voyage carrying many prominent and wealthy passengers, but it is mainly because of a well-publicized  exercise in hubris.         The White Star Line had proclaimed the Titanic the "unsinkable ship," a claim that caused Miss Hart's mother such apprehension that even as they walked up the gangplank, her daughter later recalled, she renewed her warning that calling a ship unsinkable was "flying in the face of God." She was so convinced of impending doom, her daughter later maintained, that she slept during the day and stayed awake in her cabin at night fully dressed.         The iceberg that sliced the Titanic's hull below the waterline belied White Star's claims. The network of massive bulkheads that supposedly made the Titanic unsinkable had not been extended high enough. Water gushing into one compartment simply flowed over the top of the bulkheads.         Returning to England, where her mother remarried, Miss Hart was plagued with  nightmares until, after her mother's death when she was 23, she confronted her fears head on, returning to sea and locking herself in a cabin for four days until the nightmares went away.         She held several jobs, becoming a professional singer in Australia, working as a Conservative Party organizer and serving as a magistrate in England. She described her life in a 1994 autobiography, "In the Shadow of the Titanic."         Until recent years, Miss Hart chose not to talk about the disaster, but when  she did open up, she was outspoken, denouncing efforts to salvage artifacts from the Titanic as "grave robbing," and excoriating White Star officials for failing to provide enough lifeboats.         "If a ship is torpedoed, that's war," she once said. "If it strikes a rock in a storm, that's nature. But just to die because there weren't enough lifeboats,  that's ridiculous."         Her anger was fueled by memory.         "I can remember the colors, the sounds, everything," she said. "The worst thing I can remember are the screams."         But even worse, she conceded, was the silence that followed.         "It seemed as if once everybody had gone, drowned, finished, the whole world  was standing still. There was nothing, just this deathly, terrible silence in the dark night with the stars overhead."         Miss Hart, who never married, leaves no immediate family. The remaining Titanic survivors are Edith Brown Haisman, Barbara West and Millzina Dean, all of England; Michael Navratil and Louise Laroche of France, and Eleanor Shuman, Winnifred Tongerloo and Lillian Asplund of the United States.       
         Eleanor Clark, an author best known for the evocative range of her accounts of oystering in Brittany and of the streets of Rome, died on Friday at a retirement home in Boston. She was 82.         Miss Clark, the widow of Robert Penn Warren, was a master stylist whose works won critical acclaim and inspired a devoted private following. Her writings included reviews, essays, children's books and novels.         In a review in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard called a 1975 reissue of  her 1952 book "Rome and the Villa" "perhaps the finest book ever to be written about a city."         But the most telling tributes came from the generations of American and other tourists who followed her steps -- page by dogeared page -- through the city, marveling at each architectural feature that triggered her soaring ruminations on everything from ancient history and early Roman poetry to modern social conditions.         Although she was sometimes described as a travel writer, "Rome and a Villa" is not a traditional travel book. Nor is "The Oysters of Locmariaquer," a somewhat similar book that used oystering in Brittany as a springboard to an excursion through history and culture, and won the 1964 National Book Award for  arts and letters. Each reflected deep scholarship and a lively intuition.         Both in those books and in her norels, including "Baldur's Gate" (1970) and "Camping Out" (1986), Miss Clark seemed especially moved by landscape, an interest that was grounded in her childhood amid the rolling hills around Roxbury, Conn., her daughter, the poet Rosanna Clark, said yesterday.         Born in Los Angeles, Miss Clark was a descendant of early New England settlers. Her father was a mining engineer, and she seems to have inherited her  literary and scholarly bent from her mother, a Vassar graduate steeped in comparative literature.         Miss Clark also attended Vassar and spent much of her time during her college years on visits to Manhattan. She later became a conspicuous part of the city's  intellectual left, writing for The Partisan Review, The New Republic and The Nation. She was viewed as independent-minded with a youthful social conscience and regarded herself for a time as "a Trotskyite sympathizer."         During a trip to Mexico in 1937 she became a translator for Trotsky and was married to one of his secretaries for a brief time.         During World War II she worked for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, interviewing French and Italian diplomats. It was at a party at Katherine Anne Porter's home in the spring of 1944 that she met Mr. Warren, then in the last stages of an unhappy first marriage.         Although she recounted later that she had pursued him, once confiding that it had taken all her guile to get a simple good-night kiss, at the first meeting he seems to have been more taken with her than she with him.  She left the party with one of his friends, the poet Denis Devlin, and, as Mr. Warren later railed  in recounting the meeting to his children, "a bunch of other drunken Irishmen."         After their marriage in 1952, they traveled widely and found a formula for pursuing their separate literary careers. Working in different studies of the converted 17th-century barn that served as their home in Fairfield, Conn., they  wrote from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M. daily, she using the typewriter in the companionship of their cat, he writing in longhand accompanied by their dog.         When Miss Clark was stricken with macular degeneration and almost totally lost her eyesight (a setback described in "Eyes, Etc.," her 1977 memoir), her husband began reading to her at night. He died in 1989.         In addition to her daughter, of Needham, Mass., she is survived by a son, Gabriel, a sculptor, of Wood River Junction, R.I., and four grandchildren.
