         Ruth Rawlings Mott, who oversaw an array of charitable organizations, died on Monday at her home in Flint, Mich. She was 97.         Mrs. Mott was the widow and a distant cousin of Charles Stewart Mott, a founder of the General Motors Corporation, financier and philanthropist. With him she was active in the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation and other charities in Flint and elsewhere.         After her husband's death in 1973, Mrs. Mott established her own charitable organization, the Ruth Mott Fund, which for the last 20 years contributed more than $1 million a year to hundreds of local and national organizations concerned with the arts, the environment, health and international affairs.         Born in El Paso, Mrs. Mott graduated from the Boston School of Physical Education and opened a dance studio in her hometown. She met Mr. Mott, who had been widowed twice, in 1932, and they married in 1934.         Mrs. Mott is survived by a son, Stewart Rawlings Mott of North Salem, N.Y.; a daughter, Maryanne Turnbull Mott of Santa Barbara, Calif.; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Katherine Bain, a pediatrician who became a high-ranking and an outspoken Washington official concerned with the well-being of infants and children, died on Jan. 10 in a Washington nursing home she entered in October. She was 101 and had lived in Washington since 1940.         Dr. Bain's family said that she was the author or a co-author of reports that led to the development of child-proof safety caps for medicines and for chemicals in the home, safety-release standards for the doors of refrigerators in order to keep children from being trapped and suffocated, and some of the first Federal guidelines for the nutrition of children.         Her family said that she had carried out a pioneering survey of breast-feeding practices in American hospitals' nurseries and that her findings had led to changes in doctors' opinions of nursing.         In 1940, she joined the Children's Bureau, an agency that was then part of the Department of Labor and is now part of the Department of Health and Human Services. She was the bureau's deputy chief from 1958 to 1964 and became assistant to the director of the Public Health Service in a reorganization in 1969. She devoted herself to children's welfare issues in foreign countries for the next four years and retired.         In a report in The Journal of Pediatrics in 1954, Dr. Bain presented statistics that pointed up the carelessness of American families in protecting children in the home.         Analyzing data supplied by the National Office of Vital Statistics, she said that 400 children under the age of 5 died each year in the United States from accidental poisoning. That rate was four times the rate reported for England and Wales.         Two-thirds of the deaths from accidental poisoning could be prevented, Dr. Bain said, if aspirin, barbiturates, kerosene, lye, lead and arsenic compounds were kept out of the hands of small children.         In a report issued in 1944, Dr. Bain said that World War II had intensified the need for regular advice to mothers on how to keep their babies well. ''We have a bumper crop of babies,'' she said. ''Nearly three million will be born in the United States this year. At the same time we have a shortage of doctors and nurses for the civilian population. About 50 percent of our younger practicing physicians have gone into the armed forces.'' Dr. Bain said the United States would have to work hard and fast to increase its number of clinics aimed at keeping babies well.         After the war, she bemoaned disparities in medical care available in different parts of the United States. Speaking to 500 child health and welfare experts in 1948 in Chicago, she said that a survey had found ''that 1,000 children in Illinois have on an average day twice as much medical care as 1,000 children in Alabama.''         ''One can only conclude,'' Dr. Bain added, ''that children in Alabama are receiving at the most only one-half as much care as they need.''         The honors Dr. Bain received included an award in 1960 from the New York Infirmary for work she had done in pediatrics and public health.         Dr. Bain was born in St. Louis, received a bachelor's degree in 1920 from the University of Missouri and her medical degree in 1925 from Washington University in St. Louis. She spent 13 years in private pediatric practice in St. Louis before going to Washington.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Her hair is boyishly cropped, her clothes are casual, and while riding her bike around Cape Cod she could pass as a college freshman.         But Dr. Lene Vestergaard Hau is no freshman. A teacher at Harvard University and an accomplished experimenter, she has gained a formidable reputation in a branch of science traditionally dominated by men: physics.         Most of all, she is known as the scientist who slowed light down to a walk.         Dr. Lene (pronounced LEE-nuh) Hau, at 39, is rapidly reaching the top of her profession, her colleagues agree. On Feb. 18 the prestigious scientific journal Nature selected for its cover article a paper of which she was the leading author, and it caused a mild sensation.         In their paper, Dr. Hau, with Dr. Steve E. Harris of Stanford University and two of Dr. Hau's Harvard students, reported the results of their experiment in which a beam of laser light was slowed to the astonishingly low speed of 38 miles an hour. (By comparison, light in a vacuum travels about 186,000 miles per second.)         Dr. Hau's laboratory at the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge (where she conducts research with the help of her graduate and post-doctoral students from Harvard) ) is one of a handful of organizations studying the interactions of lasers with a very peculiar kind of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.         It was by shining precisely tuned lasers on such a condensate, or cloud, of ultra-cold sodium atoms that Dr. Hau and her team reduced the speed of a light beam to a pace slower than her bicycle.         The achievement, noted by many newspapers, magazines and broadcasters, was a tour de force of pure physics, and it may also herald great practical applications.         Among them could be the development of optical switches that could enormously improve the performance of computers.         Dr. Hau presides over a half million dollars' worth of apparatus at the Rowland Institute, a research organization founded by the late Edwin H. Land, the inventor of Polaroid instant photography, to support innovative research. Unmarried, Dr. Hau lives near the laboratory and spends most of her time either at the laboratory or pondering the problems her next experiment will present.         ''I find that the shower is a very good place to think things out,'' she said, ''but sometimes I forget what I'm doing. Once I even stepped into the shower with my clothes on.''         Although increasing numbers of women have entered the sciences in recent years, their participation in physics remains very limited. Of several hundred scientists attending a typical physics meeting, only a half dozen or so are likely to be women. Dr. Hau is often asked how she came to be one of them.         ''For one thing,'' she said, ''I was lucky to be a Dane. Denmark has a long scientific tradition that included the great Niels Bohr, one of the founders of quantum theory.         In Denmark, physics is widely respected by laymen as well as scientists, and laymen contribute to physics. For instance, research in quantum mechanics has been supported in Denmark by the makers of Carlsberg beer since the 1920's. I myself was supported as a graduate student for one year by a Carlsberg scholarship.''         Dr. Hau was born in Vejle, a small town not far from the University of Aarhus, on the east coast of Jutland.         ''Neither of my parents had any background in science,'' she said. ''My father was in the heating business and my mother worked in a store. But both of them believed in giving me the same advantages as my brother, which was very important to my education.''         A prodigy who skipped 10th grade, she was immediately accepted at a ''gymnasium,'' a European upper school roughly equivalent to the first two years of college in the United States.         From childhood Dr. Hau was fascinated by mathematics, especially geometry. ''All my life I have needed to visualize things, even abstractions. Without a visualization in my head I'm lost, and geometry is very visual.''         This approach to physics works, she said, even for visualizing mathematical abstractions like Hilbert spaces (named for David Hilbert, a German mathematician), which combine a variety of physical states (or ''wave functions'') into a single mathematical entity.         ''When I first entered Arhus University,'' Dr. Hau recalled, ''I was bored by physics. They just taught us thermodynamics and classical mechanics, and that bored me. But I loved mathematics. I would rather do mathematics than go to the movies in those days.         ''But after a while I discovered quantum mechanics, and that got me interested in physics again, and I've been hooked ever since.''         Quantum mechanics is a system of probabalistic rules governing the discontinuous jumps in behavior of very small particles of matter and energy. Transistors and many other electronic devices work according to these rules.         Dr. Hau was awarded her Ph.D. from the University of Arhus in 1991 after completing a dissertation on the ''channeling'' of electrons along strings of atoms in a silicon crystal, as if the atomic strings were miniature wave guides, like the optical fibers used to guide light.         Along the way she acquired a working knowledge of English, German and French. French proved to be vital to her work during seven months of research she conducted at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva.         ''The scientific papers were written in English, but the meetings announcing the availability of various particle beams were all in French, and without French I would have been lost,'' Dr. Hau said.         ''I loved it at CERN. The people were really passionate about their work. Even at 3 in the morning you would always see people in the labs.''         In 1988, while completing her Ph.D. work, Dr. Hau made her first trip to the United States, looking for a post-doctoral job. By then she had received a one-year stipend from Carlsberg so she could accept a post-doctoral university appointment without pay. Among the scientists she met was Dr. Jene A. Golovchenko, a physicist at Harvard, who also worked at the Rowland Institute.         ''I told Jene what I had been doing and also that I wanted a complete change in direction. I wanted to work on cooling atoms,'' she said. ''He told me he didn't know anything about cooling atoms but said we could work together on it, so I was given a post-doctoral appointment. Later, the Rowland Institute gave me a staff job and my own laboratory.''         Although she is a permanent United States resident, Dr. Hau has not applied for citizenship.         ''I would like to be a citizen so I could vote,'' she said, ''but I would have to give up Danish citizenship, and that would make me feel disloyal. Last week the Danish comedian and pianist Victor Borge performed in Boston for two straight hours -- and it was hilarious -- even though he is 90 years old. Now there's a Dane for you, one to make you feel proud.''         Although much of Dr. Hau's work is done on a blackboard, she is also a ''dirty hands'' physicist who builds and adjusts much of her own complex apparatus.         In 1994, she and Dr. Golovchenko designed and built an ingenious atomic beam source called the ''candlestick,'' which is now a part of Dr. Lau's light-slowing apparatus. The device incorporates a ''wick'' made of gold-plated stainless-steel cloth, which soaks up hot molten sodium metal and wicks the sodium up to a heater that vaporizes it. A jet of hot sodium atoms then shoots out of a pinhole into the cooling apparatus that chills them to a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero.         An atom at room temperature moves at high speed, but when it is bombarded from three directions by laser beams it loses energy and slows down: it cools off. In a complicated series of stages, Dr. Hau's apparatus uses lasers to cool the sodium atoms part way, and then evaporates the fastest (and therefore hottest) of them, saving the coolest in the trap. At the end of this cooling operation (which takes 38 seconds), the cloud of atoms in the trap has been reduced to only 50 one-billionths of a degree above absolute zero, a temperature far colder than any in nature, even in the depths of space.         Because of the Uncertainty Principle -- one of the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics -- the more precisely the momentum (or velocity) of a particle is known, the less precisely is it possible to measure its position, and vice versa. At exactly zero degrees (which in practice could never be reached), a particle would have zero momentum, a precise value. This would mean that the particle's position would be highly uncertain; it might be found anywhere within a large volume of possible places.         The volume occupied by each ultra-cold sodium atom in Dr. Hau's trap expands enormously, so much so that atoms in the trap are forced to overlap and merge into what physicists call a Bose-Einstein condensate (named for the theorists Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein), in which the atoms' quantum wave functions are combined.         Once the condensate is created, a ''coupling'' laser tuned to resonate with the trapped mass of atoms is beamed into the trap chamber so that the atoms and photons of light become ''entangled'' with each other, behaving as if they were a single entity. A pulsed laser probe is then shot into the ''laser dressed'' condensate from a different direction, and some of its light passes through, but at a speed 20 million times as slow as the speed of light in a vacuum.         A table covered with a labyrinth of little mirrors guides a network of beams requiring perfect adjustment, and Dr. Hau and her team work long and tedious hours, sometimes around the clock. Their eyes become strained from exposure to the glaring yellow laser spots reflected from the apparatus.         ''Of course, we have to eat while we work, and we like pepperoni pizza, but we have to be careful to keep the optical system clean,'' she said. ''Each cooling cycle for the sodium atoms takes 38 seconds, and that gives us just enough time to take a bite of pizza, change hands and flip up one of the mirrors in the optical system to prepare for the next cooling cycle. It takes some practice.''         Dr. Hau is considering an experiment to measure localized wave functions in the cooled atom trap, allowing her to explore the structure of the condensate.         ''Some people think it might be dangerous, that the trap might explode. But the most worthwhile physics is often a bit dangerous,'' she said.         ''When you're looking at the computer monitor and you suddenly see what you had hoped you would find,'' she added, ''it's the greatest feeling in the world.''         SCIENTIST AT WORK: LENE VESTERGAARD HAU       
         Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, who transformed it from a tired magazine into a viable voice in fashion while she battled ovarian cancer and raised awareness of the disease, died yesterday morning at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 51 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.         Ms. Tilberis was highly respected for her ability as an editor, her warmth and her good humor in the face of debilitating treatments to halt the spread of the cancer that ultimately took her life. While hospitalized in December 1993 and again in the summer of 1995, she oversaw each issue of the monthly magazine, which she had taken over in February 1992. Until just a few days before her death, she was working on the June issue.         When Hearst Magazines, which publishes the 132-year-old Harper's Bazaar, hired Ms. Tilberis away from her job as editor in chief of British Vogue, it created a sensation in fashion magazine circles. She became the third reigning British editor of an important New York magazine, following Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue, and Tina Brown, who was then the editor in chief of Vanity Fair and later became the editor of The New Yorker and is now developing Talk magazine.         The fashion world was abuzz with gossip on two topics: speculation that Hearst was paying Ms. Tilberis an annual salary of $1.25 million (never confirmed or denied) and anticipation of a rivalry between Ms. Tilberis and Ms. Wintour, her predecessor at British Vogue, who had recommended Ms. Tilberis as her replacement there. (No outward signs of either hostility or warmth were seen in the years they competed in New York.)         Ms. Tilberis's aim when she took over Harper's Bazaar, she said, was to make it ''the most beautiful fashion magazine in the world.'' She hired talented stylists and famous photographers and brought in Fabien Baron to redesign the look of the magazine. Under his art direction, it developed a strong graphics style,  which was widely copied.         The first issue under Ms. Tilberis's direction, September 1992, had a stunning cover shot by Patrick Demarchelier of the model Linda Evangelista in a stark black dress against a white background with no other headline on the cover than ''Enter the Era of Elegance.'' It was a startling contrast to the usual fashion magazine cover with multiple headlines in different colors. Subsequent issues added text lines and color and eventually looked more like other fashion publications. An exception was this year's February cover of Madonna, also photographed by Mr. Demarchelier, in striking black and red.         Industry reaction to the first change in the magazine was mixed. Some saw it as coolly elegant. Others thought it boring and lifeless. But it won awards, including two National Magazine Awards in 1993.         In 1994, Ms. Tilberis was named editor of the year by Advertising Age and received an award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which was presented to her by Diana, the Princess of Wales. The two women became friends in London, where the Princess of Wales often dropped by the offices of British Vogue and also appeared on its cover twice while Ms. Tilberis was editor. The Princess was also twice on the cover of Harper's Bazaar under Ms. Tilberis's editorship, once during her lifetime and once posthumously.         The September 1994 issue of Harper's Bazaar contained an informative article by Aimee Lee Ball, ''Ovarian Cancer: One Woman's Fight,'' in which Ms. Tilberis linked her use of fertility drugs in the late 1970's to the ovarian cancer that was diagnosed in December 1993. The fertility treatments were unsuccessful. The article described the disease and its treatment, which included nine weeks of chemotherapy, which caused Ms. Tilberis to lose 30 pounds.         In another article in the magazine, in May 1996, Ms. Tilberis described in diary form a bone-marrow transplant she underwent the previous summer to eradicate vestiges of the cancer. In both articles, she chose to find something positive to say about her illness: she had gone from a size 14 to a fashionable size 6 and was pleased that her silver hair was as flattering in its new short length as it had been as a chin-length bob.         She also discussed her battle with the disease in ''No Time to Die,'' a memoir written with Ms. Ball and published last year by Little, Brown. In 1997, Ms. Tilberis became president of the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.         Elizabeth Kelly Tilberis was born Sept. 7, 1947 in Alderley Edge, a village outside of Manchester, England, to Jane and Thomas Stuart-Black Kelly. Her father was an eye surgeon, who was a pioneer in laser retinal detachment surgery and in developing soft contact lenses in the 1960's.         She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in fashion design from Leicester Polytechnic, a British school comparable to New York's Fashion Institute of Technology. It was there that she met her future husband, Andrew Tilberis, an artist, who was her tutor. She and her husband later adopted two children, Robert, now 17, and Christopher, 14.         In addition to her husband and sons, she is survived by her relatives in England: her mother, of Bath; her sister, Lois Stuart-Black of London, and her brother, Dr. Grant Kelly of West Sussex. Following her graduation in 1970, Ms. Tilberis went to British Vogue as a fashion assistant and worked her way to the top, becoming editor in chief in 1987.         Ms. Tilberis was active on the New York charity social scene, serving as chairwoman of benefits for causes like pediatric AIDS, the New York City Ballet and the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         She was scheduled to receive a Humanitarian Award in June from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which will now be given posthumously, said Fern Mallis, the council's executive director. ''We are pleased that the award was announced earlier and not something added after her death,'' Ms. Mallis said yesterday.         Despite Ms. Tilberis's personal popularity and the publicity her tenure brought to the magazine, Harper's Bazaar never ousted Vogue from its pinnacle as the fashion publication with the largest circulation and the most advertising pages. As time went by under her editorship, the magazine lost some of its specialness and began to look more like other fashion publications. It also lost some high-profile editors and photographers to other magazines.         Unfazed, Ms. Tilberis pronounced herself pleased with the magazine in an interview in 1995. ''I think we made the niche we wanted to make, and I think we are the elegant fashion magazine I wanted to create,'' she said.         In an interview published last year in The Times, Ms. Tilberis discussed the stark contrast between her glamorous job and her illness: ''You can live in the fashion world and go to fashion shows and have your picture taken, et cetera, et cetera. But there's an important balance with what really goes on in life, which is sickness and suffering and people dying. Prior to having cancer, I didn't realize there was this whole different world. It's a great wake-up call.''       
         Darlene Geis, an author and editor, died on March 25 in a fire at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         Ms. Geis wrote a number of popular books for young readers. ''The Little Train That Won a Medal'' was published in 1947 and has sold more than three million copies. She was also the author of ''Design for Ann'' (1949), ''The Mystery of the Thirteenth Floor'' (1953) and ''Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Animals'' (1959). She collaborated with Dione Lucas on ''The Gourmet Cooking School Cookbook'' (1964) and edited ''A Treasury of Great Recipes'' (1965) by Mary and Vincent Price.         Ms. Geis joined Harry N. Abrams, the art book publishers, in 1969 and eventually became senior editor for special projects. In that capacity she wrote and edited several books for Disney Enterprises, including ''Treasury of Children's Classics,'' ''The Fantasia Book'' and ''Treasury of Stories from Silly Symphonies.'' She also was instrumental in the creation of the ''The Joys of Wine'' (1977), working with Clifton Fadiman and Sam Aaron. Her other projects for Abrams included ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Operas'' and ''Encyclopedia of Quilts.''         She is survived by her husband, the publisher Bernard Geis; two sons, Peter, of La Honda, Calif., and Stephen, of Geneva; a sister, Jean S. Gottlieb of Fort Myers Beach, Fla.; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Edith Lewin, who with her husband, Bernard, amassed the largest privately owned collection of Mexican modernist art and then gave it away, died on Sunday at her home in Palm Springs, Calif. She was 88.         The Lewins, who settled in California after fleeing Berlin in 1933, started out as furniture dealers in Los Angeles, selling art along with household items. They eventually opened art galleries in Beverly Hills and Palm Springs. They began acquiring Mexican art in 1958, when they bought three paintings by Diego Rivera.         Over the next 40 years, during travels in Mexico and through friendships with artists such as Rufino Tamayo and David Siqueiros, they put together a collection of 1,800 paintings and works on paper by, among others, Frida Kahlo, Jose Clemente Orozco, Carlos Merida and Rivera, including the only portrait Rivera ever painted of Kahlo, who was his wife.         The portrait, dated 1939, will appear in the exhibition ''Diego Rivera: Art and Revolution,'' which opens at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on Sunday.         In 1997, the Lewins donated their entire collection, valued at more than $25 million, to the museum.         Ms. Lewin is survived by her husband, and a son, Ralph, also of Palm Springs.       
         Cecilia Danieli,  who helped revolutionize the world steel industry by developing the compact steel mills known in the industry as minimills, died last Thursday of cancer. She was 56.         Though women made broad strides in Italian business in her lifetime, Ms. Danieli was one of a handful who reached the top in the male domain of heavy industry. Her presence at the top, she once said, meant that Danieli consistently boasted a higher percentage of women in management posts than Italian companies of comparable size.         The company she ran, Danieli Group, founded by her grandfather in the family's hometown of Buttrio in Northern Italy, developed in the 1950's from a small manufacturer of scissors and shears to a supplier of compact steel mills to small Northern Italian steelmakers that mainly supplied the steel reinforcing bars that were the sinews of postwar Italian reconstruction.         Beginning in the 1970's, the company began shipping its engineers abroad to build mills in places like Mozambique to produce steel bars or rolling mills in the United States. These mills revolutionized steelmaking and tilted the market away from the developed world by giving scores of countries in Africa, South America and the East Asia the means to produce steel cheaply and efficiently. They ultimately led, in highly industrialized countries like the United States, to the decline of traditional big steel mills and their replacement by smaller, more flexible minimills.         Ms. Danieli, one of four sisters, was forced to take charge of the family company founded by her grandfather in 1914 in the mid-1970's, when the oil price increases in the first half of that decade drained the capital to invest in steel and scuttled further expansion. In 1976, the company posted its first loss ever. That year, she assumed the top position of managing director next to her father, Luigi, who remained president of the company but concentrated on the engineering side of the business.         She quickly rejuvenated Danieli's management, then gained a major breakthrough when the company captured a $240 million contract for a steel mill in the former East Germany from its nearest competitor, the giant Krupp group of the former West Germany. She also expanded sales in North and South America, Asia and the former Soviet Union.         In addition to its Italian headquarters, the company, with roughly 3,000 employees, had affiliates in Youngstown, Ohio, and in Sweden.         In 1984, to keep the company financially as well as technologically fit, Ms. Danieli took the unusual step for Italian family-run companies, and against the opposition of her more traditional father, of listing Danieli on the stock exchange. About 54 percent of the company remained controlled by her and Gianpietro Benedetti, her companion, with whom she shared management of the company in recent years.         Ms. Danieli entered the company in 1969 after earning a degree in economics at nearby Trieste University. A fluent English speaker, she once worked as a student for a summer on a truck farm near Schuylerville, N.Y. She avoided the limelight often favored by Italian executives. But Danieli's business success reflected her drive for technical superiority and her untiring sales efforts. A passionate student of history and a mountain climber, in the mid-1990's she once spent Christmas Day in the mountains of Iran to negotiate a sale.         She is survived by Mr. Benedetti and three children.       
         Ruth Whitney, the editor who steered Glamour magazine for 31 years and influenced several generations of women during three important decades in American feminism, died yesterday at her home in Irvington, N.Y. She was 71.         The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said her daughter-in-law, Christina Ferrari.         Mrs. Whitney was the editor in chief of Glamour, a magazine owned by Conde Nast Publications that now has a circulation of 2.1 million readers, from 1967 until last September. Part of her mission, she said, was to make feminism accessible, not intimidating, to American women.         Her reputation for frankness reached into the pages of Glamour, where -- along with the standard fare of women's magazines, like frothy fashion spreads and light service articles -- she published articles about sexuality, politics and women's health issues that other women's magazines had generally avoided. And her editorial decisions -- like putting a black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, a first in the women's magazine industry -- sometimes caused a stir in magazine circles.         In an interview a week before she retired last September, Mrs. Whitney explained her goal as editor in chief of Glamour: ''I always felt that I had a mission. I wanted to broaden the scope of a magazine to go with women's lives. I never wanted to appeal to everyone. That's not what we were about, and that's not the secret of our success. But I really wanted to make women feel good about themselves, not just about what they wore.''         Mrs. Whitney's origins were more humble than glamorous. She was born Ruth Reinke is Oshkosh, Wis., on July 23, 1928. Her mother, Helen, was a housewife, and her father, Leonard, was a designer of gravestones and mausoleums, but the only effect her father's choice of career had on her, she said last year, was that she learned to drive in a cemetery.         She was awarded a scholarship to Northwestern University, where she met Daniel Whitney, a journalism student; they married shortly after her 21st birthday. Unlike her husband, who attended journalism school but eventually ran his own advertising agency, Mrs. Whitney decided against professional journalism training and went straight to work for Time Inc. as a promotional copywriter. She didn't last long in the job.         ''It was an election year and I was madly for Adlai,'' she said. ''And the company was not madly for Adlai. So I got more and more sullen and eventually they fired me.'' To her dismay, the young Mrs. Whitney found that she could not get a job writing for Newsweek or Fortune.         ''What I always say next,'' she said, ''was that if you had a uterus, you couldn't write for those magazines.'' She found a job in women's magazines and, at 28, became editor in chief of a now-defunct magazine called Better Living, then of Seventeen. She arrived at Glamour in 1967.         During her tenure the magazine won four National Magazine Awards, including two for general excellence, in 1981 and 1991, and one in the public interest category in 1992, for a series conceived by Mrs. Whitney on the availability and safety of abortions in America. Until her death, she served on the board of the NOW Legal Defense Fund.         While she was editor, she kept a low profile. She never ran an editor's note at the front of the magazine and refused parties for her 20th, 25th and 30th anniversaries as editor in chief. When S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications, the parent company of Conde Nast, asked her what she would like for her 25th anniversary, she asked that he establish two scholarships in her name at the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University.         Despite her low-key manner, she was fond of controversy. When she wanted to feature the black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, the issue was debated at every level of the company, all the way up to the president. ''I never shied away from controversy,'' Mrs. Whitney said last year. ''It's always good for you.''         And she was a champion of women who confronted authority. In October  1991, just as Anita Hill began testifying on Capitol Hill against the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Whitney closed the December issue of the magazine -- with its special feature on notable women of the year -- and went home to watch the hearings. On Sunday she called her production manager and said that she wanted to reconfigure the issue to include Ms. Hill as one of the notable women, which she did, beating most monthly magazines to an interview with Ms. Hill.         Gloria Steinem, a former contributing editor to Glamour, said that decisions like those defined the magazine under Mrs. Whitney. ''She was always trying to get as much real information into the pages of a fashion and beauty magazine as she possibly could,'' Ms. Steinem said.         The combination of fashion and service with strong editorial articles worked especially well on the newsstand. Glamour is second in circulation in its field only to Cosmopolitan. Conde Nast is a privately held company and does not disclose the earnings of its magazines, but in 1997 Steven T. Florio, the chief executive officer, said that Glamour's annual profits were in the ''tens of millions of dollars.''         Richard B. Stolley, the first managing editor of People and now the senior editorial adviser at Time Inc., said that Mrs. Whitney's rare longevity in the magazine industry could be attributed to her forward thinking.         ''She truly tried to turn her readers into not only capable women,'' he said, ''but functioning citizens of America, with all the knowledge and concerns that she felt young women ought to have. And of course she was right.''         The magazine business was long a family enterprise. Mrs. Whitney's husband served as her sounding board on all editorial matters until his death in 1995. Her son, Philip, who survives her, was until last year an executive at Money magazine; his wife, Christina Ferrari, is the managing editor of Teen People magazine. She is also survived by a brother, Leonard Reinke, of Oshkosh.       
         Anne Richardson, former chairwoman of Reading Is Fundamental, the nation's largest organization promoting children's literacy, died on Monday at a hospital in Cheverly, Md. She was 69 and lived in Mitchellville, Md., a Washington suburb, with her husband, former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson.         The cause of death was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her son Henry.         Ms. Richardson was a founding member of Reading Is Fundamental and served as its chairwoman from  1981 to 1996. By the time she stepped down, the number of children the organization was serving had grown to 3.7 million from 3 million, the volunteer force to 219,000 from about 100,000, and Federal financing to $13.2 million from $7.6 million.         Ms. Richardson was born Anne Francis Hazard on Dec. 5, 1929, in Providence, R.I., the fourth of five children of a Rhode Island state senator. She graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe and later served on the Harvard University board of overseers.         In addition to her husband and her son Henry, who lives in Washington, she is survived by two other children, Nancy Carlson of St. George, Vt., and Michael Richardson of Upper Montclair, N.J.; a sister, Mary Conrad of Albuquerque, N.M.; two brothers, T. P. Hazard Jr. of Rockville, Md., and Oliver C. Hazard of Bedford, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.       
         Barbara White Fishman, an art director at advertising agencies who developed breast cancer and became a benefactor of the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, died Thursday at the center. She was 60 and lived in Manhattan and in Remsenburg, N.Y., where she kept a studio.         The cause was the breast cancer she had fought since it was diagnosed in 1985, her family said.         Ms. White, who was known professionally by her maiden name, once said in an interview that the illness ''refocused my energies to help others.''         She gave $5 million to Sloan-Kettering to renovate its 42-bed Women's Inpatient Center for the diagnosis and treatment of gynecological cancers. She helped design and decorate the center to create a soothing atmosphere, and to provide library space with computers and a lounge. The center, opened in late 1997, bears her name and is decorated with her photographs and paintings.         She was responsible for the Barbara White Fishman Breast Cancer Counseling Program at Sloan-Kettering. It offers individual and group counseling, including art therapy, to women with breast cancer.         Ms. White was known as the ''art angel'' at the La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts in Manhattan. She was a board member of the Friends of La Guardia and provided money so hundreds of needy art students could buy  supplies and obtain scholarships for summer courses at the Art Students  League of New York.         Ms. White also helped students from poor neighborhoods take summer arts classes at the Vermont Studio Center, and she was a chairwoman of its board. She financed art scholarships for students at Northfield Mount Hermon School in Massachusetts.         Ms. White, a native of New York, was a 1960 graduate of the Cooper Union School of Art and was a trustee of the school. At Cooper Union, she endowed a program that helps visiting art scholars and art critics.         Professionally, Ms. White designed fabrics for a textile company and designed album covers and liner notes for CBS Records. She held executive positions at various advertising agencies.         Ms. White's marriage to Dr. Jack Fishman ended in divorce. She is survived by three sons, Neil, Leslie and Daniel Fishman, all of Manhattan; a sister, Mimi Inorio of Clinton, Conn., and her companion, Jack Talan of Manhattan.         Correction:  August 30, 1999, Monday  An obituary last Monday of Barbara White Fishman, an advertising art director and a benefactor of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, misstated the date of her death and the name of an organization for which she was a board member. She died on Aug. 12, not Aug. 19. The organization is the Alumni and Friends of La Guardia High School of Music and Art and Performing Arts, not the Friends of La Guardia.       
         Zohara Schatz, a sculptor who designed a symbolic menorah for the Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, died on Tuesday in Jerusalem after a long illness.         She was 83.         Ms. Schatz's aluminum six-branched candelabrum of 1985 represented the six million Jews killed in the Holocaust. The piece, considered Yad Vashem's emblem, marks the entrance to the memorial.         The menorah is lighted once a year, on Holocaust Remembrance Day, or Yom ha-Shoah.         In 1954, Ms. Schatz, who created abstract works in metals and plastics, was the first woman to win the Israel Prize. The country's president bestows the award to distinguished scholars, writers, artists and public figures. She won the prize when she headed the Department of Arts and Crafts in the Israel's Industry and Trade Ministry.         She also won the Dizengoff Prize and awards from Yad Vashem and the Museum of Modern Art.         Her sculptures and decorative works are featured at sites throughout Jerusalem, and her work also has been shown in the Metropolitan Museum of Art and in New York galleries.         Her father, Boris Schatz, founded the Bezalel Academy of Arts and Design in Jerusalem. Ms. Schatz studied at Bezalel and later taught there, and she was a member of Yad Vashem's board of directors.         She dedicated her final years to promoting the members of the Jerusalem Artists Association and those in the Artists' Village at Ein Hod in northern Israel.         Ms. Schatz is survived by cousins.       
         Elizabeth Forsling Harris, who was briefly the first publisher of Ms. magazine, died on July 14 in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 77.         She died in a hospital of complications from emphysema, said a friend, Patricia Reilly.         Ms. Harris helped start Ms. magazine in late 1971, but she left after the first issue, citing disagreement on a wide range of issues.         In 1975, she filed a suit for $1.7 million against the first editor of Ms., Gloria Steinem, and Pat Carbine, the publisher, contending that they had fraudulently misrepresented the value of the magazine's stock. The suit was dismissed.         After Ms. magazine, Ms. Harris worked in the early days of cable television, developing a shopping service called Cable Catalog with Neiman Marcus. In 1976, she became the publisher of Working Woman. In the early 1980's, she was a deputy commissioner at the New York State Department of Commerce.         Ms. Harris was born in Greeneville, Tenn., on Jan. 8, 1922, and graduated from Mount Vernon College in Washington.         In 1941, she took a job at Newsweek in New York as a researcher. She later became a radio and television editor. In 1951, she joined ABC, where she produced a program featuring Walter Winchell, and was one of the network's first programming executives.         Two years later, she left to start her own public relations company in Dallas, where she remained through the late 1950's, until she became a special consultant for Arthur Godfrey Productions in New York.         In 1961, she was the deputy associate director of the Peace Corps. She returned to Dallas in July 1963 and was the local White House liaison for President John F. Kennedy's visit on Nov. 22, 1963.         After the Kennedy assassination, she returned to Washington, where she again worked for the Peace Corps and the Democratic National Committee.         She later worked for the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. in New York, the Urban Institute research organization in Washington and CRM Inc., in Del Mar, Calif., the publisher of Psychology Today.         Ms. Harris was the first president of the Women's Forum, a networking organization, served on the board of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and was a trustee of Mount Vernon College and Tusculum College in Tusculum, Tenn.         No immediate survivors were reported.       
         Joan Braden, a former State Department official who was a hostess and friend to high-ranking Washington figures and whose eight children inspired the ABC television series ''Eight Is Enough,'' died on Monday in Alexandria, Va. She was 77 and a longtime resident of the Washington area.         The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported. Mrs. Braden collapsed at Sutton Place Gourmet, a food store in Alexandria,  and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.         For two years beginning in 1976, Mrs. Braden was the State Department's coordinator of consumer affairs and special assistant to the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. She had also been an aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller and had worked in political campaigns for  John and Robert Kennedy.         The 1975 book ''Eight Is Enough,'' by her husband, Tom Braden, tells of their family of eight children. In 1977 the book was adapted as the ABC series, starring Dick Van Patten, which was broadcast by the network until 1981.         In the book, Mr. Braden, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate from 1968 to 1986, described his wife's personality: ''She's blithe. That's what it is about her, and that is why she is so everlastingly cheerful.''         By 1976, when Mrs. Braden took up her State Department posts, her friends included Vice President  Rockefeller, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and many other powerful figures, who would assemble at the Bradens' large yellow clapboard house in Chevy Chase, Md., a Washington suburb.         According to those who dined there, the food was simple but good,  and the furniture pleasant and necessarily childproof. There were always flowers and candles and, if the weather was right, a fireplace ablaze.         But it was not those things that made Mrs. Braden's dinner parties special, and her invitations a status symbol.         Rather, it was said in Washington, the main magnet was Mrs. Braden herself, a slight woman (5 feet 5 inches tall, admittedly too thin at 103  pounds) with short auburn hair and a wide smile -- blithe, as her husband said, and everlastingly cheerful.         Mrs. Braden herself wrote a book, ''Just Enough Rope: An Intimate Memoir'' (1989). Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Maureen Dowd said, ''Joan Braden has taken a lot of heat for this book, which has been criticized as a vapid kiss-and-sell by a Washington society hostess with the capital's most notorious 'open' marriage.''         ''The title refers to the amount of freedom the author has received from her husband,'' Ms. Dowd wrote.  ''Washington insiders, however, sniff that it also alludes to the fact that she has hanged herself with this 'intimate memoir.' ''         But ''this reviewer does not take such a harsh view,'' Ms. Dowd continued, adding that after all, how can a book be all bad that features ''a shower scene with Nelson Rockefeller, a bedroom scene with Bobby Kennedy, a toe-tingling lunch with Kirk Douglas and an account of Frank Sinatra singing 'High Hopes' without his toupee?''         Mrs. Braden was born Joan Ridley in Indianapolis, and was reared in the nearby town of Anderson and in Washington. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University, and  worked in the Pentagon during World War II.         From 1946 to 1951, she was an assistant to Mr. Rockefeller, who was then in the middle of a succession of Federal posts he filled before becoming Governor of New York in 1959. She went on to be a special assistant for public relations to  Oveta Culp Hobby, the Eisenhower Administration's Secretary of  Health, Education and Welfare.         Later she and her husband moved to California, where Mr. Braden -- with the assistance of a $100,000 loan from Mr. Rockefeller, whom he had known for years -- bought a small daily newspaper, The Oceanside Blade-Tribune. Mr. Braden published the paper for more than 13 years before selling it to South Coast Newspapers for $1.6 million.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Braden's survivors include five daughters, Mary Poole of Alexandria, Joan Ridder of Denver, Susan Zarker of Takoma Park, Md., and Nancy and Elizabeth Braden, both of Denver; two sons, David, who lives in Taiwan, and Nicholas, of Alexandria, and 12 grandchldren. One of the Bradens' sons, Tom, died in 1994.       
         Bernadette O'Farrell, an actress best known for her role as Maid Marian in the 1950's television series ''The Adventures of Robin Hood,'' died this week at 75, The Daily Telegraph of London reported on Wednesday.         Ms. O'Farrell was often seen in cinematic roles written by her husband, Frank Launder, the British screenwriter and director whose boisterous ''St. Trinian's'' movies, created with Sidney Gilliat and set in a girls' school, amused filmgoers during the 1950's and 60's. But it was her role as Maid Marian in the long-running Robin Hood series that catapulted her to stardom.         The series became one of the first British television programs to succeed in the United States, and at the height of its popularity more than 30 million viewers in Britain and North America watched its weekly episodes. Essentially a traditional version of the legend, the series, which ran from 1955 until 1958 and starred Richard Greene in the title role, proved popular with younger viewers, partly because of its catchy theme song sung by Dick James. It also had a high standard of script writing, some of it by Ring Lardner Jr., who had been blacklisted in Hollywood for his suspected Communist sympathies.         But after two years and 78 episodes, Ms. O'Farrell feared that she was becoming typecast, and in 1957 she left the series despite receiving thousands of letters begging her to stay.         Born in Birr, County Offaly, Ireland, to a bank manager and a gifted amateur actress, Ms. O'Farrell nevertheless showed no interest in the stage. After being educated at a local convent, she was working as a lawyer's secretary when she was invited  to an audition by the film director Sir Carol Reed, who knew her father.         There she met Launder, who gave her a small part in his 1947 film ''Captain Boycott,'' with Stewart Granger. In 1949 she appeared as a glamorous gym teacher in Launder and Gilliat's ''Happiest Days of Your Life,'' with Alastair Sim and Margaret Rutherford. She married Launder the next year; he died in 1997.         In the early 1950's, Ms. O'Farrell combined stage work with small parts in her husband's films, including ''The Story of Gilbert and Sullivan''; ''The Genie,'' with Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and ''The Square Ring,'' a boxing tale in which she divorced her husband because she could not bear to see him battered. She last appeared in 1959 in Launder and Gilliat's ''Bridal Path'' before retiring to spend more time with her young family on their farm in Buckinghamshire, England.         Later, she and Launder moved to Monaco, where they were active in local stage productions and charities.         She is survived by two daughters.       
         Doreen Valiente, a self-proclaimed witch who in the mid-1950's wrote part of the liturgy now used by witches around the world, died in Brighton, England, on Sept. 1. She was 77.         Through lectures and her many books, Ms. Valiente became the chief proselytizer of the white witch movement, which espouses use of magic, defined as Divine energy, for beneficial purposes.         She was held by many to be the ''mother of modern paganism,'' according to The Times of London, which reported her death on Monday. As a coven of today's witches gather in a circle, it is her version of the Charge of the Goddess, a witches' liturgical text, that the priestess recites.         ''Over the course of her life she witnessed -- and helped generate -- a sustained revival of witchcraft and paganism in Britain, despite repeated protestations by evangelical Christians,'' The Times said in its obituary.         Phyllis W. Curott, president emeritus of Covenant of the Goddess, a New York-based umbrella organization for witches, said that in recent years millions of people had been drawn to witchcraft, but that the words written by Ms. Valiente remain central in virtually every ceremony.         ''A common chord, uniting all, is a real love and appreciation for the Charge of the Goddess,'' she said.         For Ms. Valiente, witchcraft became ever more inclusive, ultimately embracing feminism, environmentalism and a host of New Age concepts, including native American spirituality.         ''It was an idea whose time had come,'' Ms. Valiente said in a 1991 interview, ''and these other things are also things whose time has come.''         Ms. Valiente became a guiding force in the wicca movement, which derives its name from an old Anglo-Saxon word for witch, or the wise one.         In the United States, Ms. Curott said, the number of wicca devotees now numbers three million to five million, making it one of the country's fastest growing beliefs.         Ms. Valiente was born Doreen Dominy in London in 1922. She was brought up as a Christian and sent to a convent school, which she walked out of at 15, refusing to return.         Biographers say that she experienced psychic episodes in her youth, and that by her late teens she was a practicing clairvoyant. She worked as a secretary by day.         In 1944, she married Casimiro Valiente, a refugee from the Spanish Civil War who went on to fight with the Free French.         In 1952, shortly after Britain had repealed its Witchcraft Act, which had outlawed witchery, she approached Cecil Williamson, then owner of the Museum of Witchcraft on the Isle of Man.         Mr. Williamson put her in touch with Gerald Gardner, who headed a group of witches called the New Forest Coven. Mr. Gardner initiated her as a witch in 1953. Ms. Valiente became the coven's high priestess and collaborated with Mr. Gardner in putting an up-to-date spin on what was billed as the witches' ancient liturgy, ''Book of Shadows,'' written in segments during the 1950's         The book was actually an eclectic mix, based principally on Charles Leland's ''Gospel of the Witches,'' published in 1899, but drawing also on Freemasonry, theosophy and the works of the Golden Dawn, a magical tradition of England and Ireland embraced by George Bernard Shaw and William Butler Yeats.         Wicca began to be practiced with its new ritual and with Ms. Valiente in a prominent position. ''She became a high priestess during an era when witchcraft was still very much in the broom closet,'' Ms. Currot said.         She was tapping into a rich and quixotic tradition. Witchcraft had persisted and sometimes been tolerated, despite laws against it going back to the seventh century.         ''The story of witchcraft in Britain is unique, in both its form and mildness, when compared with the rest of Europe,'' wrote Ronald Holmes in his book, ''Witchcraft in British History'' in 1974.         Ms. Valiente broke with Mr. Gardner in 1957 when he ignored the coven's vows of secrecy by aggressively seeking publicity. After the deaths of her mother in 1964 and husband in 1972 (neither of whom had approved of her career choice) she began to take a much more personal and active role in what witches simply call the craft.         Her most important contribution to the movement was a stream of books, including ''An A B C of Witchcraft,'' published in 1973; ''Witchcraft for Tomorrow'' (1978), and ''The Rebirth of Witchcraft,'' (1989).         A gauge of the growth of her movement is that 1964, when she gave the opening speech at the inaugural dinner at the Witchcraft Research Association, it was attended by 50 subscribers. In November 1977, she addressed an audience of 1,500 at the Pagan Federation Congress.         Ron Cooke, a fellow believer who was her companion for most of the last two decades of her life, died in 1997. She left no close relatives, but made the Center for Pagan Studies in Surrey, England, principal beneficiary.         ''She was a wise and wild woman, who definitely ran with the British equivalent of wolves,'' said Ms. Curott, who in 1985 won the case allowing witch clergy to perform weddings in New York City.       
         Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who sold her first book for $1 million when she was 98, died on Saturday in a hospital in Duluth, Minn., where she was vacationing with her daughter. She was 100.         Miss (her preference) Foveaux (pronounced FOH-voh), a snowy-haired great-great-grandmother, lived a literary fairy tale when she turned a memoir she wrote in a writing class for senior citizens in her hometown, Manhattan, Kan., into the book ''Any Given Day.''         In a 1997 auction Warner Books paid $1 million for the rights to publish the book.         In its 208 pages, she told of the quietly heroic struggle of a woman to win her independence while she was in a bitter marriage to an alcoholic. She worked in a laundry and as a nurse's aid to support her eight children before and after the divorce.         Her book, never intended for publication, ''just poured out,'' said Charley Kempthorne, a part-time farmer who taught a writing class at the Manhattan Adult Learning Center. ''She had bottled it up for many, many years.''         Miss Foveaux was an unschooled and unskilled writer, but she was clearly a born storyteller. Her words were straightforward. Of her decision to divorce, she wrote, ''I made up my mind to live my life so that I need not be ashamed to look at myself in a mirror.''         The book, which she began in 1977 and took several years to write, came to light only after an article about it appeared in 1997 on the front page of The Wall Street Journal to which Mr. Kempthorne had sent a copy. The article set off a frenzy to buy the book, leading to the auction.         The editor who acquired it, Claire Zion, called the writing ''very plain, very clear,'' and said that it would be altered only insignificantly for publication. ''We in New York try to sit here and think what the country is thinking,'' she said. ''This is Kansas talking.''         The book auction and the publicity visit to New York transported her to a new world. Miss Foveaux flew for the first time, took limousines, stayed at fancy hotels, appeared on talk shows and was written about in newspapers. She took it all with a big grain of salt.         ''I imagine I'll be like everyone else that ever got into a mess like this,'' she said.         The book was published in 1997 and remains in print but was not a best seller, despite the wide pre-publication publicity it received.         Miss Foveaux was born in Holden, Mo., in 1899, at a time when the world of Mark Twain was fading into memory. Her early childhood was spent on a small Missouri farm, but then her family moved frequently, to Arkansas and Washington State, among other places. As World War I started, she got her first job and fell in love with a young soldier. He vanished in the war, her beloved mother died, and the Depression wreaked hardship. She had eight children. As her book related, she struggled to maintain them in difficult circumstances.         She is survived by two daughters, Faye Marie Rutledge of Winder, Ga., and Aleda Torgerson of Silver Bay, Minn., and a son, Marion, of Manhattan, Kan., as well as 16 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.         In an interview after the $1 million auction, she was asked if she would buy cars and houses for her relatives. She shot back, ''They didn't help me, did they?'' The article describes family members bursting into nervous laughter.       
         Ella Mae Morse, the sultry, swinging pop-jazz singer whose 1942 hit, ''Cow-Cow Boogie,'' became the first million seller for the fledgling Capitol Records and helped establish the label, died on Saturday at the Western Arizona Regional Medical Center in Bullhead City. She was 75 and lived in Bullhead City.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her press agent, Alan Eichler.         A true original, Ms. Morse belted an exuberant mixture of boogie-woogie, blues, jazz, swing and country that transcended genres. Her 1946 recording of ''House of Blue Lights'' is considered influential in the evolution of rock-and-roll. Among her other hits were ''Shoo-Shoo Baby,'' ''Mister Five by Five,'' ''No Love, No  Nothin,' '' ''Milkman, Keep Those Bottles Quiet,'' ''The Patty-Cake Man'' and her million-selling 1952 comeback hit, ''The Blacksmith Blues.''         Ms. Morse was born in 1924 in Mansfield, Tex. Her father, George Morse, a drummer from England, led a small dance band and her mother, Ann, a native Texan, played ragtime and Dixieland piano. By age 9, Ms. Morse was singing with her father's band in nightclubs. When the family moved to Paris, Tex., she befriended an elderly black guitar player who taught her the blues and became a major influence on her style.         At 13 (but claiming to be 19), Ms. Morse auditioned for Jimmy Dorsey's band in Dallas. She won the job, but had to quit when her charade was discovered. Moving to San Diego, she was reunited with Freddie Slack, Dorsey's pianist, who had quit the band to strike out on his own as a leader. He hired her to be his vocalist just as the band was signed by Johnny Mercer and Glenn Wallichs to be the first artists on their new label, Capitol Records. Their first recording, ''Cow-Cow Boogie,'' was a novelty song.         After the song leaped to the top of the pop charts, Ms. Morse was signed to Capitol as a soloist and remained there for the next 15 years. Many of her hits were even more in the rhythm-and-blues than in the pop market, and many fans didn't know whether she was black or white. (She was white.) In 1946 she reunited with Slack to record the seminal ''House of Blue Lights.''         After taking several years off to start a family, Ms. Morse returned to Capitol studios in 1952 to record ''The Blacksmith Blues.'' Although she stopped recording in 1957, she continued to make occasional appearances, including a 1970's tour with Mr. Carter's band and an annual engagement at Disneyland with Ray McKinley's band. In 1984 she made a series of club appearances in Los Angeles, and in 1987 she appeared at Michael's Pub in New York. Two years ago her complete body of work was released in a five-CD box set by Bear Family Records.         She is survived by Jack Bradford, her husband, their children, Dan and Laura, and four children from previous marriages: Richard, Marcia, Ann and Kenny, as well as eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Georgia Hofmann, an owner and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses, including the Triple Tiara winner Sky Beauty, died Sunday at her home in Bal Harbour, Fla. She was 91.         The cause was complications from leukemia, which was diagnosed several months ago, said Lawrence G. Foster, a family spokesman.         Mrs. Hofmann learned to ride horses bareback and said that was when her love for them began. In 1962, she bought her first racehorse, a filly named Calabrea, who won her first race and paid $72 to win.         ''That horse was the real reason I am in the racing business today,'' she said years later. She did most of her own buying and selling, and bred or owned such outstanding horses as Gold Beauty, named the champion sprinter in 1982, Louis Quatorze, winner of the 1996 Preakness, Gold Stage, Maplejinsky, Dayjur, Royal Indy and Bankers Gold.         But the pride and prize of the lot was Sky Beauty, a daughter of the European champion Blushing Groom and a granddaughter of Nijinsky II. She came into prominence in 1992, when she won five starts. And, in 1993, she was only the eighth filly to win the Triple Tiara, the equivalent of the Triple Crown for fillies.         Mrs. Hofmann was the widow of Philip B. Hofmann, a retired chairman of Johnson & Johnson, the health care products company. Mr. Hofmann's lifelong interest in horses centered on jumpers, show horses and coach-and-four competitions. He left the thoroughbred racing to his wife, and when at the racetrack he often said: ''I'm just here to watch. She's the expert.''         Mrs. Hofmann's first marriage, to Fred R. Fehlhaber, ended in divorce.         Georgia Hofmann was born Georgia Ellis on a farm near Montgomery, Ala. She became a fashion model in New York and had a minor part in a musical production staged by Florenz Ziegfeld. But she seemed to have a sixth sense about a racehorse's breeding and racing potential. She spent long hours studying books and reports on bloodlines.         Mrs. Hofmann, who owned Wycombe House Stud, a 218-acre horse farm in Ocala, Fla., earned more than $12 million through the sale of 22 horses, including Sky Beauty.         Although she was ill, Mrs. Hofmann attended the Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream Park in Florida on Nov. 6. The next day, she flew to Lexington, Ky., to preside over the sale of the last of her racehorses.         She is survived by a sister, Elizabeth St. Almond of Jacksonville, Fla.; two stepdaughters, Judy Hofmann Richter of Bedford, N.Y., and Carol Hofmann Thompson of Colts Neck, N.J.; a stepson, Robert F. Fehlhaber of Fort Lauderdale, Fla; and two stepdaughters, Chris Fehlhaber McGuire of Vero Beach, Fla., and Julie Fehlhaber Flavell of Fort Lauderdale.         Mrs. Hofmann, who never had children, often referred to her horses as ''my babies.''       
         Jill Craigie, a devoted socialist and feminist who became one of Britain's first successful female film directors and whose half-century marriage to the Labor Party leader Michael Foot put her at the heart of the country's leftist politics, died on Monday in London. She was 85.         Ms. Craigie first made her mark in documentary filmmaking with ''Out of Chaos,'' a 1943 film about modern art; ''The Way We Live,'' a 1946 study of the effects of the German blitzkrieg on Plymouth, and ''Blue Scar,'' a 1948 look at life in an impoverished Welsh mining village. It was while making her film in Plymouth that she met Mr. Foot, then a candidate for Parliament. She interviewed him and a relationship began.         Ms. Craigie was born in Derbyshire to a Scottish father and a Russian emigre mother and had, by her own estimation, a wretched childhood. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. Her father was killed in World War I and her mother lived mostly abroad.         ''I used to spend most of my holidays at boarding school,'' she once said. ''I went to a dozen different boarding schools over the years and never learned anything. I was one of the rootless people. I had a very lonely childhood indeed. I turned to writing because I was lonely.''         After school, she moved to London and began writing an advice column and horoscopes for a women's magazine called Betty's Paper. She quickly found her way into artistic and literary circles. When she was 19, she married a sculptor, Claude Begbie-Clench, and they had a daughter, Julie. The marriage was short-lived.         Soon after, she married Jeffrey Dell, a scriptwriter for the movie producer Alexander Korda, and they wrote a play called ''The Judge,'' which was staged in London in 1938. This marriage was also short-lived, but Ms. Craigie was able to use the connections she made through Mr. Dell to get work in the British film industry, first making sports films and later turning to feature-length documentaries.         During these years, Ms. Craigie was romantically linked to many prominent artists and writers.         Mr. Foot and Ms. Craigie did not marry for almost two years after their meeting in Plymouth, though they lived together for much of that time. They finally married in 1949, she once said, to assuage the concerns of Mr. Foot's family.         Though many at the time doubted that Ms. Craigie's third marriage would last longer than the first two, theirs turned out to be a close and loving relationship, friends said.         She is survived by her husband and daughter.         Ms. Craigie's work as a filmmaker and writer dwindled after her third marriage, though she did write the screenplay for ''The Million Pound Note,'' renamed ''Man With a Million,'' a 1953 film starring Gregory Peck that was filmed in London.         In 1952, she wrote and produced a BBC radio documentary about the British suffragist movement, a subject that was near to her heart since a chance meeting in 1940 with a group of aging suffragists at a memorial service for one of their members.         For the last decades of her life, Ms. Craigie was said to be at work on a  history of the movement, left unfinished at her death.         In 1967, she made a television documentary called ''Who Are the Vandals?'' that was critical of housing developers. In 1995, she made ''Two Hours From London,'' a documentary about the former Yugoslavia.         As Mr. Foot's political career prospered, Ms. Craigie became known as one of his confidantes as well as the hostess for many Labor Party gatherings at the couple's home. When Mr. Foot became chief of the Labor Party in 1980, beginning a three-year leadership that ended with a crushing defeat for the party in 1983, a few asserted that he was being pushed by an ambitious wife. Ms. Craigie demurred.         ''He would be in exactly the same position he is in today had he not been married to me, except he wouldn't have had such a nice house,'' she said.
