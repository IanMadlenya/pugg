         Tanaquil Le Clercq, one of the greatest of American ballerinas, who was George Balanchine's ideal muse and Jerome Robbins's happiest inspiration at the New York City Ballet in the 1940's and 1950's, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 71 and had homes in Manhattan; Weston, Conn.; and Windermere, Fla.         The cause was pneumonia, a spokesman for the New York City Ballet said.         In a tragic end to her performing career, the still-young ballerina contracted paralytic polio in 1956 while she was at the peak of her powers. At the time she was also married to Balanchine, his fourth wife. Her luminously elegant style, the freshness of her long-legged wit and her mysterious dramatic perfume had attracted an adoring public. The dance world went into shock.         Yet although she remained paralyzed below the waist, Ms. Le Clercq became a teacher at Dance Theater of Harlem, wrote two books and frequently attended dance performances. In 1998, City Ballet opened its 50th-anniversary season with a tribute to her as a charter member of the company and to her legendary status within it. Ms. Le Clercq acknowledged a tumultuous ovation at the New York State Theater from her wheelchair as Peter Martins, the company's artistic director, presented her with a bouquet.         The tribute included films of her performances and interviews. Robbins, who cast her as the sensuous girl in his ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' summed up her range. ''Tanny,'' he said, ''could do anything.''         With an elongated physique that she used with refinement or humor (Balanchine once cast her as a dragonfly), she epitomized the modernized look in classical dancing that Balanchine was promoting in the United States in the 1940's. As the first City Ballet ballerina personally trained since childhood by Balanchine, she was naturally identified with his major works and the roles he created for her in them. These ballets included ''Symphonie Concertante,'' ''Symphony in C,'' ''Bourree Fantasque,'' ''Western Symphony'' and ''La Valse,'' in which her doomed heroine danced herself to death with chilling fervor.         Nonetheless, she was equally unforgettable in the Robbins ballets and as the stunning white-faced allegorical figure of Sacred Love wafted high above the ground by a male retinue in ''Illuminations,'' which the British choreographer Fredrick Ashton choreographed for City Ballet in 1950. In 1949, she was also willing to experiment in Merce Cunningham's works in Europe.         Ms. Le Clercq was one of those singular dancers whose dramatic projection and brilliant technique could appeal simultaneously to a broad audience and a cultlike following of artists and writers.         She was born in Paris on Oct. 2, 1929. Her mother, Edith Whittemore, was American, and her father, Jacques Le Clercq, was a French poet and writer. Their daughter was named after an Etruscan queen and was 3 when the family moved to New York.         At 7, Ms. Le Clercq began studying with Mikhail Mordkin, the former star of the Bolshoi Ballet. In October 1941, she won a scholarship competition at the School of American Ballet, founded in 1934 by Balanchine, Lincoln Kirstein and others. Ms. Le Clercq also attended the French Lycee and the King-Coit School.         Although Balanchine and Kirstein had no permanent ballet company at this time, Balanchine cast her in 1945 in a student performance of ''Symphonie Concertante,'' a ballet to Mozart. After Kirstein and Balanchine founded Ballet Society in 1946, the precursor to City Ballet, she recreated her role as the second ballerina opposite Maria Tallchief, whom Balanchine had married in 1946.         As a 15-year-old in 1944, Ms. Le Clercq had also appeared in ''Resurgence,'' a short piece Balanchine created for a benefit for the March of Dimes. Balanchine portrayed an evil character, Polio, who caused Ms. Le Clercq to look paralyzed.         Balanchine would later refer to the event as an omen of the polio attack suffered by Ms. Le Clercq while she and Balanchine were on tour with City Ballet in Copenhagen. Her misfortune affected many deeply. Robbins wrote her every day during the first year of her illness.         Balanchine returned to choreography in 1957. But even in 1959, B. H. Haggin, a critic who was especially devoted to the ballerina, wrote that for some spectators, there was ''an aching feeling of loss over the absence of Le Clercq from the works in which they had watched the development of her extraordinary powers as a dancer and as a stage personality.''         Particularly amazing was that Ms. Le Clercq affected so many in a professional career that lasted only 10 years. She was not the only dancer who served as a muse to Balanchine or with whom he had a relationship. After his first wife, Tamara Geva, left him, he lived with the ballerina Alexandra Danilova and subsequently married Vera Zorina and Ms. Tallchief. He married Ms. Le Clercq in 1952, and they were divorced in 1969. There are no immediate survivors.         Ms. Le Clercq created 32 roles for Ballet Society and City Ballet. She danced the dynamic ''Choleric'' variation in the 1946 premiere of Balanchine's ''Four Temperaments.'' In 1949 she appeared in two pieces by Merce Cunningham (''Games and Trio'' and ''Amores'') in a Paris studio.         Kirstein saw her as ''the epitome of Balanchine's lyrically athletic American criterion.'' Repeatedly, she combined French elegance with American energy, as was obvious in her dance-hall girl in ''Western Symphony,'' which Balanchine set to cowpoke tunes in 1954. Strutting on toe and her needle-sharp long legs, she exhibited flair and flounce; vulgarity was anathema to her dancing.         Her work was colored, above all, by a mysterious individuality. Others succeeded her in ''La Valse,'' a neo-romantic work by Balanchine to Ravel. But few could exemplify her pathos and fragility as she threw her head back and plunged a hand into a long black glove.         In some ballets, she was irreplaceable. In ''The Concert'' (1956), Robbins's big comic hit, she was a daffy heroine who struck a serious note with a long introspective solo. Robbins dropped the solo after Ms. Le Clercq stopped dancing.       
         Millicent Carey McIntosh, whose stewardship of the Brearley School and then Barnard College made her a national role model for generations of young women who wanted to combine career and family, died on Wednesday at her home in Tyringham, Mass. She was 102.         An outspoken feminist in the 1940's and 50's before feminism became popular, Mrs. McIntosh was the first married woman to head one of the seven top women's colleges known as the Seven Sisters and became a national icon.         ''She was a president who was ahead of her time,'' Judith Shapiro, Barnard's president, said at a gathering in 1998 at the McIntosh Student Center to mark Mrs. McIntosh's centennial birthday. She said Mrs. McIntosh, a campus legend, was a pioneer in exploring ''the struggle of both women and men to find their true roles in a changing world.''         Leora Hanser, Barnard student government president at the time of the celebration, said Mrs. McIntosh ''came from a different era, but the work and family issue is really very important, and a lot of Barnard students struggle with this today.''         In her long career, Mrs. McIntosh spoke and lectured widely, spreading ideas about women, education and child-rearing that would become popular 20 or 30 years later.         ''Having both a job and a family broadens one's perspective, which in turn makes a great contribution to a happy home life,'' she told the American Association of University Women in 1950.         She called for child care to be elevated to a dignified profession so working mothers could leave children in capable hands. And she attacked the conditioning that led young girls to feel they must subordinate their own interests when they were with boys, or to use the ''foolish technique'' of pretending they were stupid to be popular.         For anyone doubting that it could be done, Mrs. McIntosh was also the ultimate role model as she juggled marriage, five children (including twins) and her own career. Newsweek magazine viewed that as so remarkable that it put her on its cover in 1951.         But Mrs. McIntosh was less didactic than some later feminists. Even as she urged young women to participate in politics and community service and careers, she warned them that combining career and family meant pushing out nearly everything else. And she portrayed family life as a cornerstone of society and democracy, adding that in the face of conflict, family must take precedence.         ''You must be prepared to sacrifice many of your social contacts until your family is full grown,'' she said, ''and must always remember that your home comes before all else.''         She also respected the idea that happiness could come in many ways. Personal fulfillment ''may or may not lie in a career,'' she told The New York Herald Tribune in 1946. ''What is important is for each individual to order her life so that she becomes a happy, creative person.''         Her approach to life was rooted in common sense and a lack of pretense, physically and intellectually. A small, trim woman, she often wore plain suits without decoration. As a college president, she swept her own vestibule and weeded her own garden. And when she was honored after 10 years as chief of Barnard, she agreed on the condition that there be no speeches, no gifts and no flowers.         She also disliked honorifics. She preferred ''Mrs.'' to Dean and was often referred to as ''Mrs. Mac.'' When Barnard officials referred to her in news releases as ''Dr.,'' she chided them, saying, ''There is only one doctor in our family,'' referring to her husband, Dr. Rustin McIntosh, a pediatrician who taught at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons.         Mrs. McIntosh saw education in its broadest sense, from conjugating irregular Greek verbs to sex education, as the way to prepare young women for the complicated balancing act she was urging on them. She believed that the education of young women for motherhood was society's ''most important task.''         At a time when few women were represented in the boardrooms of major American corporations, Mrs. McIntosh was a director of several companies, schools, foundations and civic groups.         After her retirement in 1962, she and her husband moved to their farm in Tyringham, Mass. Her husband died in 1986. Mrs. McIntosh is survived by a daughter, Susan Lloyd of Tinmouth, Vt.; 4 sons, James, of Ann Arbor, Mich., R. Carey, of Tyringham, Kenneth of West Newton, Mass., and J. Richard, of Boulder, Colo.; 10 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.         Millicent Carey McIntosh was born on Nov. 30, 1898, in Baltimore, the daughter of Anthony Morris Carey, who ran a machinery supply business, and the former Margaret Cheston Thomas, both active Quakers. She had five brothers and sisters, and all were taught to mend and darn and market and cook.         Her feminist notions were shaped by strong role models in her family. Her mother fought for women's suffrage, racial equality and prison reform. Her aunt, M. Carey Thomas, was a pioneer in women's education, a founder of the Bryn Mawr School (a girls' school in Baltimore) and president of Bryn Mawr College.         At Bryn Mawr, young Millicent played water polo and basketball and majored in Greek and English, graduating magna cum laude. She organized clubs for factory workers before accepting her aunt's offer of a year of study abroad.         After studying economics at Cambridge and English at Johns Hopkins University (where she did her doctoral thesis on 14th-century English mystery dramas), Mrs. McIntosh became an instructor at Bryn Mawr College. But she quickly was appointed dean of freshmen and then acting dean of the college.         She left Bryn Mawr to became headmistress at the Brearley School, the private girls school in Manhattan, from 1930 to 1947, and converted it from a half-day format to a full day. When she arrived, she asked her students to help plan the ''ideal school'' with the fewest possible rules. She worked without a desk because she felt that a desk intimated students. She introduced aptitude tests and remedial instruction and instituted a sex education course for sixth graders, which she taught.         In 1932, after she married Dr. McIntosh, her aunt discouraged her retirement, telling her, ''You can have your babies in August.'' At Brearley, she had five children. (She took to wearing academic robes to cover pregnancies.)         She was a hands-on manager, both at school and at home. She left detailed instructions for her household: menus, shopping lists, activities for the children. And every morning, she called Brearley to specify a hymn for morning assembly.         In late 1946, before Barnard had its own president (she was given the title in 1952), Mrs. McIntosh was chosen from more than 60 candidates to succeed Virginia Gildersleeve as Barnard's dean. It was a life that left few free minutes, but Mrs. McIntosh grabbed every one. She signed correspondence during intermissions at concerts and took her secretary with her to the beauty parlor so she could give dictation.         An administrator who valued good teaching, Mrs. McIntosh was dismayed that teachers were paid less than secretaries and dedicated some of Barnard's endowment for faculty salaries.         She also valued merit, and directed another part of the Barnard endowment to scholarships to open Barnard's doors to ''still more girls of superior talent regardless of their ability to pay.''         As she balanced career and home, Mrs. McIntosh acknowledged both her husband's support and good household help (which at one point included a governess, a cook and two daily helpers). She also respected the individuality of her children, keeping each in a separate school until one year, after attending five separate Christmas pageants, she said, ''I thought if I heard one more 'Silent Night' I would break down.'' Their schooling was consolidated.         At Barnard, she continued to teach: English and modern living, a required class that sought to help students think through their lives. She also presided over a $10 million fund-raising campaign.         John D. Rockefeller Jr., who rarely contributed to development funds, agreed to give Barnard $1 million, he told Mrs. McIntosh, ''because of my confidence in the exceptional vision and leadership you are bringing to the college.''         Even after she retired from Barnard, the trustees continued to consult her. In 1971, when men's and women's colleges everywhere were going coeducational and Barnard was facing pressure to merge into Columbia, Barnard's chairwoman, Eleanor Elliott, turned to Mrs. McIntosh, who suggested that the trustees try to answer three questions: Would a merger produce better education for Barnard and Columbia? Would relations between Barnard women and Columbia men be improved? And would a merger create economies for both colleges?         ''Mrs. Mac's questions helped organize our thinking simply and calmly,'' Mrs. Elliott said in an interview, ''and of course, we felt stronger.''       
         Anne Ball, a retailing executive who helped impart a stylish image to some of the country's most elite clothing stores, died on Jan. 19 in Manhattan. She was 52 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was liver cancer, said her husband, Frank Ball.         With taste described as avant-garde yet refined, Ms. Ball held merchandising and consultant positions at Neiman Marcus, Barneys New York and Saks Fifth Avenue. Most recently, she was overseeing the expansion of Seibu, a Japanese department store chain that is opening six stores in Tokyo.         In 1986, Ms. Ball and her husband formed the retail management company Ball Group Inc. Together they developed a branch of the French retailer Printemps in Denver in the late 1980's. Known for an urbane look and chic clothes, Printemps did not catch on in Denver, and the store eventually closed.         The couple also helped create a more modernistic image for Stanley Korshak in Dallas, one of the country's best-known specialty clothing stores.         Ms. Ball's work with Printemps did catch the eye of Gene Pressman, the former co-chairman of Barneys New York, who hired her to direct merchandising in stores that Barneys was opening across the United States.         Simon Doonan, creative director at Barneys New York, credited Ms. Ball with introducing conceptual designers like Azzedine Alaia into Barneys stores outside Manhattan and helping to reaffirm the chain's image as a daring retailer.         Ms. Ball left Barneys before it  reorganized and closed many of the stores she helped conceive.         The daughter of an Army colonel, Ms. Ball was born Anne Carter in Osaka, Japan, in 1948. She traveled extensively in her youth before returning to the United States and marrying Frank Ball at the age of 16 in 1965. She graduated from North Texas State University in 1970.         In 1991 she was named president of the designer clothing line Anne Klein Collection; while working there, she earned a master's degree in literary criticism from New York University.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Ball is survived by her mother, Lillian Harwell Carter of Pulaski, Tenn.; a sister, Paige Carter Garner of Nashville; and a daughter, Jayne Denison Ball of the Marshall Islands.       
         The last queen of Italy, Maria José of Savoy, who served after World War II for only 27 days before Italians voted to abolish the monarchy, died on Saturday in a Geneva hospital. She was 94.         The daughter of Albert I, king of Belgium, Maria José in 1930 married Prince Umberto II, whose father, King Vittorio Emanuele III, cooperated with Mussolini before and during World War II.         Maria José was a little less pliant to the Fascist dictatorship, refusing to Italianize her name to Maria Giuseppina even after Mussolini made it a rule. Italians, who called her the ''rebel queen,'' described her as a closet anti-Fascist. When she fled Rome for Switzerland after Mussolini's fall in 1943, she reportedly told friends that she regretted not having joined Italian Partisans who fought to oust the Germans.         After the war, Maria José became queen on May 9, 1946, when Vittorio Emanuele abdicated in favor of his son, hoping that the gesture would keep the monarchy alive. It did not.  Italians could not forgive the royal family for its early support of Mussolini or for fleeing Rome in 1943 when he was overthrown and Italy changed sides and declared war on Germany.         Two years after a referendum that abolished the monarchy, Italy passed a law banning all male members of the Savoy family from setting foot in Italy. It is still in force, despite lobbying and legal challenges by Maria José's oldest son, Vittorio Emanuele, and her grandson, Emanuele Filiberto, the current heir to the throne.         Umberto and Maria José moved to Portugal even before the results of the referendum were made known, and she left her husband after a year and set up home in an 18th-century villa near Geneva, where members of the ousted dynasty spent their exile. Umberto died in 1983.         She will be buried next to her husband in Hauntecombe Abbey, in France, where many rulers of the Savoy dynasty are interred.       
         Barbara DeWitt, a former rock star promoter who later helped create provocative advertising campaigns for Calvin Klein, died on Dec. 31 in Golden Beach, Fla. She was 58 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. DeWitt had cancer for the last year and a half, said her brother, the photographer Bruce Weber.         Born Barbara Weber, she became head of publicity for United Artists Records in the late 1960's, but left after four years to open her own publicity agency, with clients that included Frank Zappa, Ike and Tina Turner and Iggy Pop.         In the mid-1980's, Ms. DeWitt left the music business and worked with Mr. Weber to cast and produce print advertising campaigns for fashion companies like Ralph Lauren, Gianni Versace and Calvin Klein. Ms. DeWitt cast many of the young men and women who appeared in Mr. Klein's ads, using nonmodels.         In addition to her brother, she is survived by her husband, Timothy DeWitt, an architect, of Mariposa, Calif.; and two sons, Noe, of Manhattan, and Jeremy, of Seattle.       
         Dr. Alexandra Adler, a New York neurologist and psychiatrist who carried on the tradition of her father, Alfred Adler, one of the pioneers of psychoanalytic theory, died Jan. 4 at New York University Hospital. She was 99 and lived in Manhattan.         A native of Vienna, she was among the earliest women to practice as a neurologist there and then in the United States. Her work on brain damage and alexia, the loss of the ability to read because of brain lesions, was often cited by others in the field.         She also wrote papers on psychological subjects ranging from alcoholism to juvenile delinquency. She was among the first to write detailed papers on post-traumatic stress syndrome, reflecting her studies of the surviving victims of the Coconut Grove nightclub fire in Boston in 1942, one of the nation's worst fire disasters.         Besides killing more than 490 people, the blaze left others with permanent brain damage. Dr. Adler studied the anxiety and depression that can follow such catastrophes and later applied her findings to the treatment World War II veterans.         Dr. Adler interpreted Adlerian theories in a book first published in 1938, ''Guiding Human Misfits: A Practical Application of Individual Psychology.'' It went through several editions in the United States and was republished in Germany in 1990.         Dr. Adler received her medical degree in Vienna, where she trained and practiced at the neuropsychiatric clinic of the University of Vienna. At the time, she also started editing the International Journal of Individual Psychology, the branch of psychology her father pioneered after he broke with Sigmund Freud and his psychoanalytical emphasis on sex as the root of neurosis.         She came to this country in 1935 to teach and practice at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital. She joined the N.Y.U. faculty in 1946 and became a full professor of psychiatry at the its medical school in 1969.         An expert in schizophrenia, she worked at the New York City Department of Correction for 20 years with female offenders and was medical director of the Alfred Adler Mental Hygiene Clinic in Manhattan. She continued to see some patients at her private practice until a few years ago.         She contributed entries to national and international reference works.         In 1959, Dr. Adler married Dr. Halfdan Gregersen, a former dean and professor of Romance languages at Williams College. He died in 1980, and there are no immediate survivors.       
         Fuki Kushida, a pioneer Japanese campaigner for women's rights, a peace activist and an opponent of nuclear weapons, died at her home in Tokyo on Monday, a family announcement said. She was 101.         In February last year, at the age of 1OO, Ms. Kushida made headlines from her wheelchair, leading a demonstration of Japanese women in the Ginza district of Tokyo against closer military ties with the United States.         Last summer, she also led protests against United States military bases on Okinawa after a United States Marine was charged with molesting a 14-year-old Japanese girl in her own bed on the eve of President Clinton's visit to the island for a summit meeting.         ''The recurrence of such unforgivable crimes by U.S. soldiers is extremely upsetting,'' Ms. Kushida said in a statement. ''As long as U.S. bases exist there, our fear will never end and violence against women will continue.''         Born in Yamaguchi Prefecture on Feb. 17, 1899, Ms. Kushida entered the Women's University in Tokyo but dropped out to marry Tamizo Kushida, a Marxist economist who died before the outbreak of World War II.         Left at 35 with two children to support and little money, Ms. Kushida worked as an insurance saleswomen and magazine reporter.         The hardships she experienced made her aware of the difficult lives many Japanese women led and encouraged her to devote her life to working for the advancement of women and the promotion of world peace.         After World War II, she joined the emerging Japanese feminist movement and worked with Yuriko Miyamoto, a leading feminist writer of the time. In 1946 Ms. Kushida became the first secretary general of a newly established feminist and peace organization called the Women's Democratic Club.         In 1958 she was elected third president of the Federation of Japanese Women's Organizations, a group opposed to nuclear weapons and committed to promoting peace. Today it encompasses 19 organizations and has about 900,000 members.       
         Sonia Arova, a Bulgarian-born ballerina who became an international star and was an early partner of such great male dancers as Erik Bruhn and Rudolf Nureyev, died on Sunday in San Diego. She was 74.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         Ms. Arova was the ballerina with whom Nureyev danced the ''Don Quixote'' pas de deux at his New York debut with Ruth Page's Chicago Opera Ballet on March 10, 1962, at the Brooklyn Academy of Music. She and Bruhn first met in the mid-1940's in the Metropolitan Ballet, a short-lived but artistically enterprising London troupe.         Nureyev, Bruhn, Ms. Arova and the American ballerina Rosella Hightower joined forces to present sensationally successful programs together in Paris in 1962. Later that year, she was again Nureyev's ballerina as guest artist with the Royal Ballet in London.         A dancer of strong technique and dramatic projection, Ms. Arova was born Sonia Errio in Sofia, the Bulgarian capital, where she studied music as well as ballet, receiving her dance training at the school of the Sofia Opera Ballet. When her teachers recommended further study in Paris, she left Bulgaria at age 11 with her mother. Her father sold his stamp collection to pay for her Parisian classes.         With the outbreak of World War II, Ms. Arova's British piano teacher in Paris urged her to escape France. Disguised in male attire as the teacher's son, Ms. Arova was smuggled into England on a fishing boat in 1940. She never saw her father again but was eventually reunited with her mother and sister.         In England, she danced with International Ballet (1942), Ballet Rambert (1946) and, most notably, with Metropolitan Ballet (1947-48). Then she became a balletic globe-trotter.         Ms. Arova was first associated with Page in Paris in 1951 when she danced a leading role in ''Revenge,'' the popular choreographic adaptation of the opera ''Il Trovatore'' that Page created for Les Ballets des Champs Élysées. Later, she appeared with Page's own Chicago company.         She was guest artist with American Ballet Theater several times in the 1950's and 60's, dancing both classical and contemporary works. Reviewing her performance in 1956, John Martin of The New York Times said she had become ''a lovely and curiously individual dancer, especially where dramatic color and characterization are involved.''         She also danced with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, the Marquis de Cuevas Ballet, London Festival Ballet, the Komaki Ballet of Japan, the Australian Ballet and the National Ballet of Washington.         Ms. Arova became increasingly involved with company direction, often in association with Thor Sutowski, the American dancer and choreographer, whom she married in 1965. As director of the Norwegian National Ballet from 1966 to 1970, she introduced several ballets by George Balanchine into the repertory, produced the first complete Oslo versions of ''Swan Lake'' and ''La Sylphide'' and was knighted for her services by King Olaf V.         She became director of the San Diego Ballet in 1971. In 1977 she and Mr. Sutowski were named co-directors of the dance department at the Alabama School of Fine Arts, a state-run high school in Birmingham. Many dancers they trained joined the Birmingham-based Ballet South, which made its New York debut at Brooklyn College in 1996 with a ''Swan Lake,'' staged by Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski. Anna Kisselgoff of The Times praised it for allowing its young women to ''show off a brilliant clarity and detail in their footwork'' and ''dance with a pure classical style.''         Ms. Arova and Mr. Sutowski returned to San Diego in 1997, where they taught for both the San Diego Ballet and the California Ballet.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Ariane Sutowski of San Diego, and a sister, Jeanette Errio of Vence, France.       
         Rose Freedman, the last survivor of the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Thursday in her apartment in Beverly Hills, Calif., her daughter said. She was 107.         Mrs. Freedman, who at the time of the Manhattan fire was two days shy of 18, escaped death in 1911 by following company executives to the roof to be rescued. She became a lifelong crusader for worker safety, telling and retelling the story that the Triangle workers died because the owners were not concerned with their welfare.         The disastrous factory fire, in which girls and young women leapt from eighth- and ninth-story windows, their flaming skirts billowing in the wind, horrified the nation and led to some of the first city, state and federal laws dealing with workers' safety. It gave a powerful impetus to the fledgling labor movement, greatly strengthening the building of the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, which two years before the fire had led a three-month strike to focus attention on conditions in workplaces like the Triangle factory.         The union's successor, the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees, confirmed that Mrs. Freedman, who was Rose Rosenfeld at the time of the fire, was the last survivor to die. The next-to-last, Bessie Cohen, died two years ago.         Mrs. Freedman's life after the fire was colorful and courageous. In World War I, she saved the life of a spy in Austria. After her husband's death, in 1959, she went back to work to support her three children, two of whom had polio. Lying about her age, she worked at a Manhattan insurance company until she was 79.         Mrs. Freedman, who always wore high heels, celebrated her centennial by attending Spanish classes in a Mexican town with cobblestone streets, but refused to abandon her heels for more sensible shoes. ''I'd look matronly,'' she said.         Her involvement in the fire never left her consciousness, and she appeared at labor rallies for the rest of her life. She always expressed rage that the factory doors had been locked, either to keep workers at their machines or to prevent them from stealing scraps of cloth. She always told of how one of the owners tried to bribe her to say the doors were not locked. She refused.         The owners were eventually acquitted of manslaughter charges when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families.         On the day of the fire, Mrs. Freedman escaped the inferno by stopping to consider what the executives were doing. She somehow thought they would be safer, and went up to the 10th floor, where their offices were, to find out. They were taking the freight elevator to the roof, where firefighters pulled them to the roof of an adjacent building. She did the same.         The alternative was jumping.         ''Girls in shirtwaists, which were aflame, went flying out of the building so that you saw these young women literally ablaze flying out of the windows,'' she said in a Public Broadcasting System documentary, ''The Living Century,'' shown in December and January.         As she was taken down the steps of the adjacent building, she stopped on each stoop to sit down and cry. ''When I came in the street, here comes my father,'' she recalled. ''He collapsed. He fainted. And I didn't go back to work anymore. I went to college.''         The anger about what she saw as the owners' greed persisted. In the documentary, she said:         ''That's the whole trouble of this fire. Nobody cares. Nobody. Hundred forty-six people in a half an hour. I have always tears in my eyes when I think. It should never have happened. The executives with a couple of steps could have opened the door. But they thought they were better than the working people. It's not fair because material, money, is more important here than everything.         ''That's the biggest mistake -- that a person doesn't count much when he hasn't got money. What good is a rich man and he hasn't got a heart? I don't pretend. I feel it. Still.''         Rose Rosenfeld was born on March 27, 1893, in a small town north of Vienna. Her family ran a profitable business importing and exporting dried foods. After her father visited New York and fell in love with it, the family began spending more and more time in the United States, finally emigrating in 1909. They sailed on the Mauretania.         With Mrs. Freedman's father devoting most of his time to Jewish studies, the business was run by her mother. An aunt who lived with the family once sharply criticized the young woman's housecleaning abilities. ''You call this work?'' she demanded.         Mrs. Freedman's response was to go out the next day and take a job at the Triangle factory. Since her language skills were good -- she eventually spoke seven languages -- she was given the prestigious job of operating a large machine to attach buttons to the blouses. Her only close friend at the factory, a forewoman, died in the fire.         She attended college in New York, although family members are not sure where.         When she and her mother took a trip to their Austrian hometown to show Mrs. Freedman's grandparents that she was really alive, World War I had broken out, and the Russians had invaded Austria. Her grandfather had befriended a man who turned out to be a Russian spying against his own country for Austria. She told of hiding him by burying him in coal in the basement, then talking the pursuing Cossacks into leaving without a search.         After returning to New York, she got a job with Cunard, the steamship line. In 1927, she married Harry Freedman, an American she had first met at the American Club in Vienna. He owned a typewriter store in New York.         They had three children. When the two youngest were stricken with polio, Mrs. Freedman asked when they would be able to walk. The doctor said, ''Five years.'' She replied, ''I have time.''         Mr. Freedman died at 59, leaving Mrs. Freedman no money or source of income. She got an accounting job at the Manhattan Life Insurance Company. Her youthful appearance enabled her to say she was 50, when she was actually 64.         ''Of course it was a lie, but they didn't know it was a lie,'' she said. She worked until she was 79.         In 1995, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son Robert and her daughter, Arlene March, live. There, she became such an avid fan of the Lakers that she became livid if someone phoned while a game was being shown on television. On her 100th birthday she was presented with a team jersey bearing the number 100.         She exhibited paintings at the Beverly Hills Art Fair, and continued to paint almost until her death. She had her hair and nails done weekly, and shopped and cooked for herself.         Mrs. Freedman was still attending Spanish language classes at 107.         ''To me, 106 is a number,'' she said in the documentary. ''I lived that long, not only on account of my genes, but on account of my attitude. You've got to stand up for yourself. Am I right?''         Other survivors are another son, Herbert, of Rye Brook, N.Y., eight grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. She was overjoyed at the great-granddaughter's birth, and always advised the child's mother, her granddaughter, Dana Walden, who is president of 20th Century Fox Television, not to get caught in grief when loved ones died.         ''Sadness takes years from you,'' she said.         Her own passing ends a chapter of history. Steven Latham, director of the documentary, suggested it was something like the last Holocaust survivor dying.         ''This is the last voice of an event,'' he said. ''This woman actually smelled the smoke.''       
         Toby Wing, whose pert good looks and vivacious personality made her a cinematic bombshell of the 30's -- as well as the heroine in a storybook romance with a celebrated aviator, Dick Merrill -- died on Friday at her home in Mathews, Va. She was 85.         ''Miss Wing is a nice girl with a face like the morning sun,'' The New York World Telegram proclaimed in 1937.         Starting in 1931, when she was 16, she made 38 movies in little more than a decade, becoming America's favorite pinup from Jean Harlow's death in 1937 until Betty Grable led G.I.'s to World War II in a swimsuit.         Miss Wing, her platinum hair shining brilliantly, was the original Goldwyn Girl, the first of Samuel Goldwyn's one-to-a-picture sex symbols, appearing in ''Palmy Days'' in 1932. She also appeared in Busby Berkeley's lavish musicals and in no time was getting roles requiring no small dash of sexual innuendo.         In the 1937 film ''True Confession,'' she was a secretary being interrogated by a lawyer, played by Fred MacMurray. The lawyer asks her to take shorthand, perhaps to see if she can or, more likely, to prove a point. Miss Wing stares back and says, ''Are you kidding?''         At the time, Paramount said she was receiving more fan mail than either Marlene Dietrich or Claudette Colbert, and she had carved out a highly visible niche.         ''She was a sex symbol, let's face it,'' said her nephew William H. Perry Jr.         But almost as suddenly as the shooting star flew, it crashed to earth. In 1940, the baby she had with Mr. Merrill died in his crib, and the couple moved to Florida to raise their second son in privacy. She made only one more film, ''The Marines Come Through,'' in 1943.         Some of her work was uncredited, and not a few of her parts were small, but she left behind moments that are treasured by film enthusiasts. It was to her, wearing a white fox bra above a bare midriff, that Dick Powell in sang ''Young and Healthy'' in the original ''42nd Street,'' in 1933.         Her publicity pictures were an industry in themselves. She posed, in succession, with at least five fiancés. She balanced on pyramids of rubber balls, and in one particularly inspired moment she was pictured saving a co-star from imminent death by drowning.         Once, she visited West Point, where she promised a cadet a signed photograph in return for a pair of cadet pajamas.         The pajamas arrived, and according to The Daily News, they were made of Mandarin silk with hand-embroidered flowers. Whether she reciprocated with a picture seems to have gone unreported.         She dated, or at least was said by the movie magazines to date, Maurice Chevalier, Alfred Vanderbilt and Franklin Roosevelt Jr. But it was her romance with Henry Tindall Merrill, known as Dick, that captured the national imagination. Mr. Merrill was the first aviator to fly a trans-Atlantic round trip and established such a record of safety on the La Guardia-to-Miami route for Eastern Airlines that be became known as New York's favorite pilot.         Not to say that Mr. Merrill was the first aviator to whom she was publicly linked. The New York American in 1936 told of her sorrow at the death of an army aviator with whom she had ''an understanding'' that marriage was imminent. She said in the article that the actor Jackie Coogan, another boyfriend, had been furious that the aviator had given her his West Point ring.         The next year, she told The Daily News that she was done with men. ''I have really given up falling in love with men!'' she said. ''Oh yes! My career is now to be my life.''         Six months later, The New York Herald Tribune carried a short item speculating that she was about to marry Mr. Merrill. The newspaper said she ''shook her blond tresses'' and said, ''You never can tell.'' They eloped to Tijuana 11 months later.         Martha Virginia Wing was born in Amelia Court House, Va., on July 14, 1915. Toby is an old family nickname.         She is survived by her sister, Patricia Gill of Gloucester, Va., and two granddaughters. Mr. Merrill and their second son, Richard, both died in 1982.       
         Maude Russell Rutherford, a singer and dancer in the glory days of black theater in the 1920's who always said she was the one who really introduced the Charleston on Broadway, died on March 8 at her home in Atlantic City. She is believed to have been 104.         Strikingly pretty, she was billed as the Slim Princess when she worked with Josephine Baker, Fats Waller and Pearl Bailey. Never a star, Ms. Rutherford was usually the soubrette or a featured performer and a great favorite at Harlem's Cotton Club.         She wrote her particular footnote to history in 1922 in the Broadway show ''Liza, '' an all-black revue with lyrics and music by Maceo Pinkard.  While many dance histories credit the 1923 show ''Runnin' Wild'' with bringing the Charleston to Broadway, Ms. Rutherford led the ''Liza'' chorus girls in the dance a year earlier.         She remained proud of her dance abilities to the end of her life.         ''I used to kick 32 times across the stage, and my legs would hit my nose,'' Ms. Rutherford told Jean-Claude Baker, who was reared by Josephine Baker and who is a student of black entertainment. ''I was a dancing fool.''         Ms. Rutherford was born in Texas to a black mother, Margaret Lee, and a white father, William McCann. With interracial unions prohibited, her parents never lived together.         As a teenager working as a ticket taker, Ms. Rutherford met Sam Russell, a star of the black theater with the comedy team Bilo and Ashes. He asked her to go on the road with him. She demanded marriage first. The marriage was violent and short. Ms. Rutherford, weary of being beaten, surreptitiously relieved her husband of $100, then struck out on her own.         Tall, with a sweet voice, she would play the bouncy, good-time girl, perhaps the comic relief. ''I'm Forever Blowing Bubbles'' was a youthful audition choice. Early in her career a producer tried to mold her as a blues singer, but, as Ms. Rutherford told Mr. Baker in a taped interview, it did not fit. The producer said, ''Honey, you stick to bubbles.''         Her style offstage was down to earth and no-nonsense, and she used language too vivid to be called plain-spoken; she described one colleague as ''so ugly she could take a stick and break day.''         Ms. Rutherford's theater credits included ''Dixie to Broadway'' (1924), ''Chocolate Scandals'' (1927) and ''Keep Shufflin' '' (1928). She left show business in the 1950's and in 1953 married her fifth husband, Septimus Rutherford, chief steward for the Moore-McCormack Lines. She worked as a switchboard operator in an Atlantic City hotel.         But she never lost her show-biz flair.         When her husband died in 1980, Ms. Rutherford had her name carved into the headstone she and her husband would share, as well as a birth date, Mr. Baker said.         But instead of 1897, which she had told friends was the year of her birth, the carved date was 1902.         ''She said, 'By the time I die, nobody will be here to remember, so I will go forever in eternity five years younger,' '' Mr. Baker said.       
         Dame Ninette de Valois, the founder of England's Royal Ballet and a major British choreographer, died yesterday at her home in London. She was 102.         With keen vision and unflagging energy, Dame Ninette guided one of the 20th century's greatest ballet companies.         It was under her directorship, from 1931 to 1963, that the troupe made its United States debut with Margot Fonteyn in 1949. As a choreographer, she experimented widely, yet regarded classical ballet as the basis for dance training. Her works often looked Expressionistic or grotesque, and she had dancers perform in bare feet as well as in toe shoes, but all were rooted in the academic ballet tradition and could be performed only by classical dancers.         Most of her best-known creations date from the 1930's. ''Job'' (1931) was inspired by William Blake's illustrations for the biblical story. ''Bar aux Folies-Bergère'' (1934) derived from the Manet painting of a Parisian nightspot. ''The Rake's Progress'' (1935) brought to life Hogarth's series of paintings showing a fashionable young man's decline into debauchery and madness. ''Checkmate'' (1937) was an allegorical chess game between love and death.         Despite her love of art as source material, Dame Ninette's ballets were more than living pictures. Theatrically vivid, they were also thoughtfully conceived. As early as 1928, Dancing Times, a British magazine, called her ''essentially a choreographer who thinks.''         When her death was announced by the Royal Ballet, Sir Anthony Dowell, the company's director, offered a tribute to Madam, as Dame Ninette was known to generations of dancers: ''Through her achievements she will remain a source of inspiration and encouragement as she has been throughout her life to so many of us as dancer, choreographer, director, teacher and mentor.''         The daughter of an English Army officer, she was born Edris Stannus in County Wicklow, Ireland, in 1898; her family moved to England when she was 10. She once recalled that as a girl, she was reserved, obstinate and ''capable of the sulks.'' Later in life, a medical examination revealed that she had survived undetected childhood polio.         She enjoyed ballroom dance classes, and her mother, who invented Ninette de Valois as a stage name, considered her talented. At age 12, she was sent to the Lila Field Academy, a London theatrical school. She danced in London productions and studied with some of the major teachers of the day, including Edouard Espinosa, Nicholas Legat and Enrico Cecchetti. When almost every British seaside resort boasted  a theater, she toured the country until, as she later joked, she felt as if she had ''danced the 'Dying Swan' on every pier in England.''         In 1923 she joined Serge Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, remaining with it for three years.         Returning to London in 1926, Miss de Valois opened a school and began to build what eventually became a national ballet company. She was soon involved with three important theater groups: the Old Vic in London, the Festival Theater in Cambridge and the Abbey Theater in Dublin. For them, she staged dances in plays, taught classes and presented dance programs. At the Abbey she worked with William Butler Yeats on some of his plays that combined poetry and dance.         On May 5, 1931, her dancers from the Old Vic offered their first full program, and a company was born. Called the Vic-Wells Ballet (after the jointly managed Old Vic theater and the Sadler's Wells, where the company originally performed), the troupe became the Sadler's Wells Ballet when all its performances were at that theater. It kept that name in 1946 when it moved to the Royal Opera House and in 1949 when it made its New York debut.         After the company settled into the Royal Opera House, Miss de Valois  established a second company, the Sadler's Wells Theater Ballet, at Sadler's Wells. This troupe was reorganized in several forms over the years and was the forerunner of today's Birmingham Royal Ballet, a major British company.         The original London company was renamed the Royal Ballet when it received a royal charter in 1956. Dame Ninette, who was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1951, remained its director only until 1963. Yet, for the rest of her life she helped guide the policies of the company and its affiliated school.         Although she choreographed less as her administrative duties increased, she remained an esteemed choreographer. She also offered directorial advice at the founding of the Turkish State Ballet in 1947 and choreographed for it on occasion until 1966.         She was considered a strict disciplinarian in the classroom, yet she was a witty conversationalist and, during her stage career, excelled in comic roles. Dame Ninette also wrote poetry, although she seldom published it. However, in 1985 the Sadler's Wells Trust issued ''The Cycle,'' a volume of her poetry, with all proceeds from its sale going to the Sadler's Wells Development Appeal.         As she became frail in later years, Dame Ninette spent most of her time at home. She was frequently visited by dance colleagues and her choreography was revived to the acclaim of new audiences. In 1993 there were two successful revivals: ''Checkmate,'' produced by the Royal Ballet, and a triumphant staging of ''Job'' by the Birmingham Royal Ballet, which was danced in theaters and in Coventry Cathedral. Dame Ninette attended the opening performance of ''Job'' when the Birmingham company had a season at Covent Garden that July, and she and her ballet received an ovation.         In 1998, to celebrate Dame Ninette's 100th birthday, the Royal Ballet offered ''The Rake's Progress'' as part of a gala program that included excerpts from some of her other works, and the Birmingham Ballet revived ''The Prospect Before Us'' (1940), a comedy about the rivalry between two 18th-century theater managers.         Dame Ninette always kept her private and public lives separate. In ''Come Dance With Me,'' an autobiography published in 1957, she noted that she was married in 1935, but not once in the book did she mention her husband's name: Dr. Arthur Connell, a physician who died in 1987. She left no survivors.         Dame Ninette was awarded the French Legion of Honor in 1950, and received the Erasmus Prize (1974), the Society of West End Theaters' Special Award (1992), the Dance Magazine Award (1998) and honorary degrees from London (1947), Reading (1951), Oxford (1955), Aberdeen (1958) and Cambridge (1992) universities. In 1980 Queen Elizabeth II made her a member of the Companions of Honor, for those who have done ''conspicuous national service.''       
         Ann Sothern, a deft comedian and talented singer who was known as the Queen of the B's at Columbia and RKO, where she made 18 movies between 1934 and 1936, died on Thursday at her home in Ketchum, Idaho. She was 92.         Perhaps never the star she might have been, Ms. Sothern was nevertheless one of the shrewdest actresses around. Her astuteness would eventually lead to her ownership of two early television series, ''Private Secretary'' and ''The Ann Sothern Show.''         In 1938 Ms. Sothern ditched her blond ingénue image and stormed Hollywood's greatest studio, MGM, only to be stuck in a wildly successful series of 10 movies about a tough, scatterbrained, down-on-her-luck Brooklyn chorus girl with a heart of gold, Maisie Ravier.         ''Maisie'' (1939), which had been bought for Jean Harlow and then shelved when Harlow died, was an instant phenomenon. Letters addressed to ''Maisie, U.S.A.'' had no trouble being delivered. After ''Congo Maisie'' (1940), ''Gold Rush Maisie'' (1940), ''Ringside Maisie'' (1941) and ''Maisie Was a Lady'' (1941) and between ''Swing Shift Maisie'' (1943) and ''Undercover Maisie'' (1947), Ms. Sothern begged the studio head, Louis B. Mayer, to allow her to quit the series. Mr. Mayer always answered: ''No. Your movies pay for our mistakes.''         Through bad luck or fate, Ms. Sothern was never more than a minor star: ''a Hollywood princess,'' she once said, ''not a Hollywood queen.''         Joseph Mankiewicz, the Academy Award-winning director who cast Ms. Sothern in her best role, as the soap opera-writing wife of Kirk Douglas in ''A Letter to Three Wives'' (1949), said of her: ''Poor Annie. Annie was a damned good Broadway musical comedy actress.  She had the sexiest mouth any woman ever had. But, at Metro, poor Annie got stuck in the Sam Katz unit.  She never got the big break Gene Kelly and others did, of being with the Arthur Freed steamroller of talent.''         Ms. Sothern got a few chances to show off her her talent, her timing and her figure in MGM musicals, most notably ''Lady Be Good'' (1941) and in the Ethel Merman role in the film version of the Cole Porter musical comedy ''Panama Hattie'' (1942). And she got good reviews as a hard-boiled ex-waitress pressed into service as a nurse and doomed when the island of Bataan was conquered by the Japanese in the World War II drama ''Cry Havoc'' (1943). But it would be 35 years after ''Cry Havoc'' before she earned her sole Academy Award nomination.         In 1988, at the age of 79, she was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for her performance as Lillian Gish's optimistic friend and neighbor in the 1987 drama of old age, ''The Whales of August.''         A few months before the nominations were announced, Ms. Sothern told an interviewer that her chances were dismal. ''I think Hollywood has been terrible to me,'' she said. ''Hollywood doesn't respond to a strong woman, not at all. I was too independent. How dare a woman be competitive or produce her own shows?''         Like her friend Lucille Ball, Ms. Sothern turned early to television. In  their B-movie days at RKO, the two actresses had cried on each other's  shoulders, with Ms. Sothern complaining that she got all the roles Katharine Hepburn did not want and Ms. Ball saying that she got all the parts Ms. Sothern did not want.         Ms. Sothern was savvy enough to produce ''Private Secretary,'' and to demand that the situation comedy be shot on film, to preserve it. As Susie McNamera, private secretary to a New York talent agent, Ms. Sothern became a heroine to secretaries all over America. The show alternated Sunday nights on CBS with ''The Jack Benny Show'' from February 1953 to September 1957.         When Ms. Sothern quarreled with the show's other producer over her right to take on movie roles, she left the series and sold her 104 episodes for well over $1 million. She immediately returned to CBS in ''The Ann Sothern Show'' as the assistant manager of a swanky New York hotel.  Lucille Ball, as Lucy Ricardo, was a guest star on the first episode, and Ms. Sothern returned the favor several times as the Countess Framboise on ''I Love Lucy.'' In 1989, 28 years after ''The Ann Sothern Show'' went off the air, the actress sold the rights to the cable channel Nickelodeon, where the show became an unexpected hit.         Ann Sothern was born Harriette Lake on Jan. 22, 1909, in Valley City, N.D., where her mother, a concert singer, was on tour. She was the eldest of the three daughters of Walter and Annette Yde-Lake. Of Danish stock, she was raised in Minnesota by her mother and grandmother after her father, a meat salesman and womanizer, deserted the family when she was 5.         At 16 she was named the outstanding high school composer in Minnesota and sent to Detroit to represent Minnesota in a national contest. She spent a year at the University of Washington before joining her mother, who was a singing teacher in Hollywood. When half a dozen bit parts in movies got her nowhere, she tried Broadway with somewhat more success.         Florenz Ziegfeld offered her a part in ''Smiles'' with Marilyn Miller, but the star considered the 20-year-old Ms. Sothern too much competition and had her fired after the Boston tryout. In 1931 she played the ingenue in ''Everybody's Welcome,'' the play that introduced the song ''As Time Goes By''; she then toured for seven months in the George S. Kaufman-Morrie Ryskind-Ira and George Gershwin musical ''Of Thee I Sing.''  After the tour ended she took over the same role on Broadway, replacing Lois Moran. And Hollywood noticed.         She was signed by Columbia Studios, which changed her name to Ann Sothern and her hair color from red to platinum blond. From ''Let's Fall in Love'' in 1933 through ''The Hell Cat,'' ''Blind Date'' and ''Kid Millions'' with Eddie Cantor in 1934, the Maurice Chevalier musical ''Folies-Bergère'' in 1935 and a dozen more lightweight but pleasant musicals and comedies, she bubbled and sang.         Married to the bandleader Rogert Pryor and living in a huge rented house in Beverly Hills, she decided she had had enough of B movies. ''I found a much smaller house in Hollywood,'' she recalled. ''We lived cautiously, not as extravagantly, for a year. I was just so sick of those pictures, I decided I wasn't going to do them anymore.''         After making seven movies in 1937, she was off the screen until 1939, when she returned with fourth billing in an A movie, MGM's ''Trade Winds,'' as Fredric March's manipulative secretary. When he saw ''Trade Winds,'' Walter Ruben, the producer of ''Maisie,'' refused to cast one of MGM's contract actresses as Maisie; he insisted on Ann Sothern for the role that would define her career for the next decade.         In 1950, with her MGM contract coming to an end, she collapsed on the ski slopes at Sun Valley, Idaho, with a near-fatal case of hepatitis and was in and out of hospitals for a year. She had divorced Pryor in 1942. In 1943 she married the actor Robert Sterling and had a daughter. That marriage also ended in divorce.         Her movie career was essentially over, too, although she had solid parts in Gore Vidal's satirical political drama, ''The Best Man,'' and the Olivia de Havilland thriller ''Lady in a Cage,'' both in 1964. In 1965 she played her most bizarre role, as the voice of the mother of Jerry Van Dyke reincarnated as a 1928 Porter automobile in the television series ''My Mother the Car.''         Like many former stars she turned eventually to summer stock and dinner theater, with disastrous results. In 1974 on a stage in Jacksonville, Fla., falling scenery broke her back and smashed the nerves in her legs. She finished the performance, held together with silver gaffer's tape.         Told she would probably never walk again, she refused to accept the diagnosis. Immensely athletic, she was a crack trap shooter and deep sea fisherman, and her MGM contract gave her three months off each winter to ski in Sun Valley. She never came to terms with what the accident had done to her body. But she did walk, with a cane that she used reluctantly and constantly misplaced. And, a decade after the accident, she moved out of Southern California to Ketchum, where she could see Dollar Mountain, which she used to ski, through the window of her house.         A different kind of accident brought her one more chance for glory. The producer of a television remake of ''A Letter to Three Wives'' thought it would be a great marketing ploy to get one of the original stars, Jeanne Crain or Ms. Sothern, to play a cameo role. Ms. Sothern's bit part let Lindsay Anderson, the director who would be making ''The Whales of August,'' know that Ms. Sothern was still alive.         Mr. Anderson had retained ''a memory of her charm'' from Ms. Sothern's early musicals. ''In a sense she was too good an actress to be a star,'' he said. ''Being a star requires elephantiasis of the ego.''         Ms. Sothern is survived by her  daughter, Tisha Sterling, an actress and designer; a sister, Sally Adams of Boise, Idaho; and a granddaughter.         Summing up her career after ''The Whales of August,'' Ms. Sothern shook her graying gold ringlets and said, ''I've done everything but play rodeos.''         Correction:  March 20, 2001, Tuesday  An obituary of the actress Ann Sothern on Saturday misidentified the distributor of ''Trade Winds,'' a 1938 film in which she played a supporting role. It was United Artists, not MGM.         Because of an editing error, the article also misidentified the television show on which she appeared as the Countess Framboise. It was ''The Lucy Show,'' not ''I Love Lucy.''       
         Josephine Premice, an actress nominated for Tony Awards for her performances in the musical ''Jamaica'' and ''A Hand Is on the Gate,'' an evening of black poetry, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was emphysema.         Ms. Premice, whose married name was Fales, also starred on Broadway from 1976 to 1977 in the musical ''Bubbling Brown Sugar.'' Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Clive Barnes wrote that Ms. Premice ''can almost make a feather boa come alive.'' Her other Broadway appearances included ''Mister Johnson'' in 1956, a play about Nigeria by Norman Rosten, based on the novel by Joyce Cary.         Writing about Ms. Premice's 1957 performance in ''Jamaica,'' which starred Lena Horne, the Times dance critic Jennifer Dunning described her as ''a razzle-dazzle lead performer who was hot flame to Horne's cool fire.''         ''A Hand Is on the Gate'' moved in 1966 to the Longacre Theater from the New York Shakespeare Festival, where it originated under the title ''An Evening of Poetry and Folk Music of American Negroes.'' Ms. Premice worked frequently for Joseph Papp, appearing in an all-black production of ''Electra'' for the Shakespeare Festival's mobile theater, which toured the city's boroughs in 1969.         She was also in the festival's 1973 production of ''The Cherry Orchard,'' directed by James Earl Jones.         Ms. Premice was in the original cast of ''House of Flowers,'' a musical comedy by Truman Capote that was choreographed by George Balanchine and featured Pearl Bailey, Juanita Hall and Diahann Carroll. She left the production before it moved from Philadelphia to Broadway, but appeared in an Off Broadway revival of the play in 1968.         On television, she was a frequent  guest on ''The Merv Griffin Show'' and a guest star on the sitcom ''A Different World.'' She also played Louise Jefferson's sister on ''The Jeffersons'' and appeared on ''The Cosby Show.''         Born in Brooklyn in 1926 to Haitian parents, Ms. Premice grew up in New York and Haiti and studied dance with Martha Graham and Katherine Dunham. She began her theatrical career in the 1945 production of ''Blue Holiday'' at the Belasco Theater alongside Ethel Waters and Josh White, the folk singer.         Ms. Premice's final stage performance was as Amanda Wingfield in the first professional all-black production of Tennessee Williams's ''Glass Menagerie'' at the Cleveland Playhouse in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, Capt. Timothy Fales of Paris; a son,  Enrico Fales; a daughter, Susan Fales-Hill; and a sister, Adele Premice, all of New York.       
         Maria Karnilova, a charter member of American Ballet Theater who channeled her comic gifts and vitality as a dancer into an award-winning career as an actress on Broadway, died on Friday in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.         A versatile performer, Ms. Karnilova won a Tony Award in 1964 when she portrayed Golde, opposite Zero Mostel as Teyve, in ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' She was also nominated for a Tony for her role as Hortense in ''Zorba'' in 1968 and was praised for her hilarious performance in 1959 as Tessie Tura, a stripper in ''Gypsy.'' She played Golde again in the 1981 revival of ''Fiddler.''         Ms. Karnilova's career after 1946 was focused on Broadway and television as well as opera and regional stage productions. From the 1940's through the 60's, these included ''Miss Liberty,'' ''Two's Company,'' ''The Beggar's Opera,'' ''Kaleidoscope'' and ''Bravo Giovanni.'' Nonetheless, she often spoke of ballet as her first love. ''There is nothing more wonderful than being onstage,'' she once said of dancing.         She started her professional career in 1927 in the Children's Ballet of the Metropolitan Opera and joined the corps when Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, was founded in 1939. As a soloist, she excelled  in comic ballets like Antony Tudor's ''Judgment of Paris,'' Michel Fokine's ''Bluebeard,'' David Lichine's ''Helen of Troy'' and Agnes de Mille's ''Three Virgins and a Devil.''         Ms. Karnilova was occasionally seen in classical solos, as in ''Aurora's Wedding,'' the last act of ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' and in Tudor's dance dramas. (She was the former mistress in his ''Jardin aux Lilas.'')         In 1943, John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, noted that she was originally listed in programs as Maria Karniloff but was now called Karnilova. Whatever her stage name, he was taken with her vibrant personality. When she portrayed the sixth wife in ''Bluebeard,'' he wrote, ''She dances the role excellently and plays it with charm and a nice comedy sense.''         When she was cast in the mime role of Giselle's mother in 1944, Mr. Martin wrote, ''Who should turn up but Maria Karnilova, of all people, playing delightfully and obviously having the time of her life.''         Ms. Karnilova was a soloist when she left Ballet Theater in 1946 to appear in ''Call Me Mister,'' a Broadway revue, and a series of musicals, many directed or choreographed by Jerome Robbins, a close friend from her corps days at Ballet Theater. In 1958-59, she appeared as a guest in ''The Concert'' in Robbins's short-lived troupe, Ballets: U.S.A.         Ms. Karnilova was born in Hartford on Aug. 3, 1920, to Russian parents, Phillip Dovgolenko and Stephanida Karnilovich Dovgolenko. After the family moved to Brooklyn, Mr. Dovgolenko went to the box office of Loews State, a movie house in Manhattan, and asked where his daughter could take ballet lessons. The cashier pointed to the Metropolitan Opera House, then on West 39th Street. Ms. Karnilova began studying with Margaret Curtis at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School and trained later with Fokine, Tudor, Edward Caton and Anton Dolin.         After appearing in small groups headed by Fokine and Mikhail Mordkin, whose company was the nucleus of Ballet Theater, she danced with the Salmaggi Opera at the Hippodrome in New York and in ''Stars in Your Eyes,'' a Broadway musical. She then joined Ballet Theater and later appeared there as a guest in 1955-56 and in 1959. She was the ballerina of the Metropolitan Opera Company in the 1952-53 season.         Ms. Karnilova met her husband, the actor George S. Irving, in the cast of ''Call Me Mister'' and married him in 1948. He survives her, along with a son, Alexander of Oceanside, Calif.; a daughter, Katherine Irving Stark of South Salem, N.Y.; and three grandchildren.       
         Marjorie Hunter, a reporter for The New York Times who covered the White House and Congress at a time when most other women in Washington journalism were assigned to the activities of the first lady, died here today. She was 78.         The cause was acute leukemia.         Journalism was almost completely a male bastion here until Eleanor Roosevelt started holding press conferences every other Tuesday in the 1930's and decreed that only women could attend.         The Times at first resisted assigning a woman to its Washington bureau and instead sent a reporter from New York to the White House each time that Mrs. Roosevelt held a press conference.         In time, that reporter left the paper and Ms. Hunter -- Maggie to everyone from copy boys to presidents -- was hired in 1961 as her replacement.         But Ms. Hunter, who had covered the Legislature in North Carolina and had an affinity for politicians, soon tired of news of the first lady and persuaded her boss, James Reston, to assign her to cover Congress and other government news.         In ''The Girls in the Balcony,'' (Random House, 1992) Nan Robertson, a former reporter for The Times, wrote of the obstacles that women in Washington journalism faced in the 1960's. The balcony in the title referred to the perch above the auditorium of the National Press Club, which did not allow women on the floor and barred them from membership.         ''Maggie Hunter recalled the day she started a little mutiny at The New York Times bureau because of the balcony,'' Ms. Robertson wrote. ''Scotty Reston, then the bureau chief, had sent her off to the club to cover a speech by Madame Nhu, the beautiful and sinister female leader of South Vietnam, the wife of Ngo Dinh Nhu.         ''Now, Maggie, a Southern lady and a thorough professional, was no feminist firebrand. That day, however, 'I stood on a rolled-up carpet in the back of the balcony and I couldn't hear a goddamned word going on down there -- I couldn't hear a word.'         ''Afterwards, she marched, fuming into Reston's office. She blurted out, 'Scotty, don't you ever send me to that damned National Press Club ever again.'         ''Reston turned to Wallace Carroll, the bureau's news editor, who had befriended Maggie at The Winston-Salem Journal in North Carolina and had brought her to The Times. 'Wally,' said Reston slowly, with an air of innocent wonderment, 'what's wrong with Maggie?'         '''I don't think,' she said years later, 'that Scotty ever understood why I was so mad.' ''         Ms. Hunter was born June 2, 1922, in Bethany, W.Va., and grew up on the campus of Elon College in North Carolina, where her father, Joshua A. Hunter, was a professor and her mother, Minna, taught in the local school system.         She was managing editor of the Elon College newspaper while a student and was also a correspondent for the local paper, The Burlington Times-News. She graduated from Elon in 1942 and then worked as a reporter for The Raleigh News and Observer, The Houston Press and The Winston-Salem Journal.         She retired from the Times in 1986.         Ms. Hunter is survived by a niece, Susie Frye of Hickory, N.C., and a nephew, Thomas Walker of Richmond, Va.         In 1969, Ms. Hunter was elected president of the Women's National Press Club. Its name was changed to the Washington Press Club when it started admitting men. The National Press Club finally admitted women in 1971 and the two clubs were merged in 1985.         Ms. Hunter was inducted into the North Carolina Journalism, Advertising and Public Relations Hall of Fame in 1992. Her citation said:         ''A firm believer in the watchdog function of the press, Hunter gained notoriety for a 1955 incident in which she challenged the Appropriations Committee's right to convene in closed session and had to be carried from the room while still sitting in her chair.''       
         Nyree Dawn Porter, who entranced millions of television viewers around the world when she starred as the beautiful Irene, trapped in a loveless marriage in the BBC adaptation of John Galsworthy's ''Forsyte Saga'' in the late 1960's, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 61.         Her agent said she died unexpectedly but gave no further details.         Produced by Donald Wilson to coincide with the centenary of Galsworthy's birth, the 26-part ''Forsyte Saga,'' which recounted the lives and loves of an upper-middle-class merchant family in London from 1879 to 1926, was first broadcast in 1967 and went on to attract more than 100 million viewers in 26 countries. It was shown in the United States on public television starting in 1969.         For Ms. Porter, whose performance won her an award from the Society of Film and Television Arts as best actress and designation by Queen Elizabeth II in 1970 as an officer of the Order of the British Empire, ''The Forsyte Saga'' proved to be a mixed blessing.         She said that afterward, BBC regarded her as ''our Irene'' and turned aside her agent's efforts to have her cast in other major roles. And her private life was shadowed  by her success and her travels as an actress. Her husband, Bryon O'Leary, an actor who had been a childhood friend and was often thrust aside by ''Forsyte'' fans eager to meet Irene, died in 1970 of an overdose of whiskey and barbiturates.         In 1976 Ms. Porter married another actor, Robin Halstead. Before they divorced in 1987, they had a daughter, Tayla, who survives her.         After ''Forsyte,'' Ms. Porter said, ''I waited for the movie offers to pour in, but they just didn't.''         Nevertheless, she remained busy. She starred in several British television series and continued to act on the stage and in films. In 1998 she played the ballerina Margot Fonteyn in the film ''Hilary and Jackie.''         Ms. Porter was born in New Zealand on Jan. 22, 1940. She was given a Maori name, Ngaire, meaning little heart-shaped flower, but for clarity she changed it to Nyree, its phonetic pronunciation. She left New Zealand for England in 1958.         In a few more years, her work in ''The Forsyte Saga'' would win her one critic's designation as ''the first romantic sex symbol of the telly age.''       
         Kay Willis, who used the skills she honed as a mother of 10 to organize a national parents' support group and write a popular book on how to be a good parent, died on April 5 at a hospital in Montclair, N.J. She was 71 and lived in Rutherford, N.J.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Believing that the women's movement was overshadowing motherhood, Mrs. Willis and a few like-minded women formed Mothers Matter, an educational group, in Rutherford in 1975, in the home where she and her husband, Benedict, raised six daughters and four sons.         For the next 25 years she spread her gospel on the vital importance of healthy child-rearing to families and to the country. She lectured widely, conducted seminars, appeared on national television programs and served on industry advisory boards on toys and other products.         Most of her seminars were directed at mothers, usually 15 to 50 of them at a time. But she and her husband, Benedict P. Willis, also started a series of seminars for fathers, which she continued after his death.         Mrs. Willis, assisted by Maryann B. Brinley, published '''Are We Having Fun Yet? The Sixteen Secrets of Happy Parenting'' (Warner Books, 1998). It has been translated into six languages and remains in print in this country.         Catherine Rubacky Willis was born in Passaic, N.J. She attended Chestnut Hill College in Philadelphia but left before graduation in 1950 to marry and start a family.         Her husband died in 1988. She is survived by their daughters, Jo-Ellen Willis-Rose of Little Rock, Ark.; Kim, of Boulder, Colo.; Patricia and Maureen, of Rutherford; Fran White of Dallas; and Jeanne, of Manhattan; their sons, Benedict 3rd, of Ramsey, N.J.; Timothy and Jerry, of Rutherford; and Dan, of East Rutherford; two brothers, Dr. Gerald Rubacky of Monclair, N.J., and Joseph Rubacky of Wyckoff; a sister, Ellen Tobin of Bay Head, N.J.; and 11 grandchildren.         Mrs. Willis regarded bringing up baby as the most important job anyone could have. One of her central messages was that in order to take good care of children, parents must take good care of themselves. Parenthood, she said, was to enjoy, not just to endure.         Of course there were practical considerations, too.         ''In my lifetime,'' she once said, ''the two biggest advances in raising children have been the clothes dryer and the disposable diaper.''       
         Carmencita Romero, who performed with Katherine Dunham in her first company, the Negro Dance Group, in the mid-1930's, died on May 6 at the Florence Nightingale Nursing Home in Manhattan.         She was 87.         Ms. Romero, whose name was originally Lily Butler but changed her name at Ms. Dunham's request,  began her training at 18 when she studied ballet and modern dance with Ms. Dunham, later adding Caribbean ethnic dance when Ms. Dunham returned from anthropological studies in the West Indies. ''I kept thinking that it was good that Daddy didn't know what I was doing because he certainly would not have approved such dancing,'' Ms. Romero said in the American Dance Festival documentary ''Free to Dance.''         She began performing with Ms. Dunham in the late 1930's, traveling with the group to New York, where she appeared in the musicals ''Cabin in the Sky'' and ''Carmen Jones.'' She toured the United States with the Dunham company until 1942. In the late 40's she returned home to Chicago and opened a dance school, then left to open others in Rome and Tokyo and to teach throughout Europe. She also performed in films made in Rome and London.         Ms. Romero returned to the United States in 1981 and became an instructor at Spelman College in Atlanta.  Her last performance was in December 2000 in a program with the Joan Peters Dance Company at the Donnell Library Center of the New York Public Library in Manhattan.         Ms. Romero also choreographed for dance companies and festivals and, in the 1960's, for the television series ''The Man From U.N.C.L.E.'' At the time of her death, she had just finished writing her memoirs, ''Soaring Spirit.''         She is survived by a son, Raleigh Mohammed Hylton of the Bronx.       
         Susannah McCorkle, the sultry voiced pop-jazz singer who brought a rare literary refinement to popular standards, was found dead outside her apartment at 41 West 86th Street early yesterday morning. She was 55.         She had apparently jumped to her death, the police said. She had left a suicide note, but the police would not reveal its contents. In her apartment, the singer had left a will, along with detailed instructions about disposition of her estate.         With a smoky, often kittenish pop-jazz voice and phrasing that lingered stealthily behind the beat, Ms. McCorkle was a direct stylistic descendant of Billie Holiday, who was her primary influence. A student of lyrics and a prolific writer herself, she liked to find new ways of interpreting familiar standards. Her pensive, slowed-up rendition of ''There's No Business Like Show Business,'' for instance, found an underlying sadness in Irving Berlin's razzle-dazzle anthem. She also had special and continuing love for Brazilian pop, to which she devoted an album, ''Sabia'' (Concord Jazz), whose lyrics included her own translations from  Portuguese. Many of her later albums included at least one standard composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim.         With a repertory of more than 3,000 songs and with 17 albums to her credit, Ms. McCorkle was more than a nightclub singer. She was a passionate, intrepid scholar of 20th century pop. And her cabaret shows, which she wrote herself, featured rich anecdotal histories of the songwriters whose work she performed. Her honors included three Album of the Year awards from Stereo Review.         As a prose writer, Ms. McCorkle published fiction in Mademoiselle, Cosmopolitan and ''The O. Henry Book of Prize Short Stories,'' and nonfiction in The New York Times Magazine and American Heritage. Her lengthy pieces for American Heritage included extended appreciations of Ethel Waters, Bessie Smith and Irving Berlin.         Born in Berkeley, Calif., on Jan. 4, 1946, Ms. McCorkle had a peripatetic  childhood because her father, an anthropologist, took teaching positions at colleges around the country. Eventually she enrolled at the University of California at Berkeley, where she majored in Italian literature. It was the era of the free speech movement, and Ms. McCorkle, disillusioned with American politics, dropped out of college and traveled to Europe to study languages and to begin a literary career. It was while living in Paris that she discovered American jazz, when a friend played her a recording of Billie Holiday singing ''I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues.''         ''That one record completely revised my thinking and made me want to become a professional singer,'' she recalled years later. In 1972 she moved to London, where she began singing with a band led by the trumpeter John Chilton. Before long, she was eking out a living singing in pubs throughout London.         Jazz singing gave her a sense of belonging. ''Before that, I had always been solitary and introverted,'' she said. ''As a singer, I began meeting other people who were solitary and introverted but who were also great jazz musicians. It was like finding my tribe.''         Returning to the United States in the late 1970's, Ms. McCorkle had her American breakthrough with a seven-month engagement at the Cookery, in Greenwich Village. Two albums that she had recorded in London were re-released in America. Championed by a coterie of music critics and disc jockeys, Ms. McCorkle built a modest but solid career, recording several more albums for small labels and eventually landing on Concord Jazz, for which she recorded steadily over the next decade.         Ms. McCorkle became a regular fixture at New York's leading cabarets, especially at the Oak Room of the Algonquin Hotel. Her Concord Jazz albums included records devoted to the songs of Cole Porter, George Gershwin and Irving Berlin. But her wide-ranging taste in songs embraced not only the great craftsmen of the pre-rock era but contemporary writers like Paul Simon, Rupert Holmes and Alan and Marilyn Bergman.         Her most recent album, 1999's ''From Broken Hearts to Blue Skies,'' which became the basis of one of her finest cabaret shows, was an alternately witty and wistful sequence of songs (by everyone from Billy Strayhorn to Dave Frishberg to Irving Berlin) describing the romantic mood swings of a single woman in New York City. She had completed a new album, ''Hearts and Minds,'' that was scheduled for release in August.         In recent years, Ms. McCorkle developed interactive music workshops for children ages 5 to 18, which she gave at Lincoln Center, Borders bookstores and in public schools in New York, New Jersey and Florida.         She is survived by her mother, Margery McCorkle, of Oakland, Calif.; and two sisters, Margery Pinson, of Texas, and Kate McCorkle, of Santa Monica, Calif.

         Dorothee Metlitzki, a retired professor of English at Yale and a prominent scholar of medieval Arabic, Middle English and Herman Melville, died on April 14 in Hamden, Conn. She was 86.         Her most definitive work focused on the intersection of Arabic and English culture during the Middle Ages, but she was also known for her scholarship on Melville, Chaucer and ''The Pearl,'' a seminal medieval poem.         Dr. Metlitzki was born in Germany and spent part of her childhood in Russia, where her family fled the Bolsheviks for two years. She grew up in Lithuania. Although English was not her native language, she gained renown teaching and writing about American and British culture.         At Yale and elsewhere, Dr. Metlitzki was known as a riveting lecturer and storyteller who would regale her audiences with firsthand accounts of some of the 20th century's most turbulent times. Her father, an international businessman, was imprisoned by the Bolsheviks but later freed by his own workers. And Dr. Metlitzki herself left Eastern Europe just as the Nazis were coming to power and lost members of her family to the Holocaust.         When she was 17, she went to the University of London, where she became a protégée of Moshe Sharett, who later became the second prime minister of Israel. After receiving a bachelor's degree and two master's degrees, she moved to Jerusalem and took part in Israel's founding.         She was a co-founder of the English Department at Hebrew University, helped found a self-help organization for Arab women and traveled around the world marshaling support for the Jewish state.         When Golda Meir was prime minister of Israel, Dr. Metlitzki served in her government: she worked as press officer for the Foreign Ministry and secretary for the affairs of Arab women in the Israeli Federation of Labor.         In 1954 Dr. Metlitzki enrolled in the new Ph.D. program in American Studies at Yale. She then taught English at the University of California at Berkeley and became the second woman to receive tenure in Berkeley's English department.         In 1966 she returned to Yale and there, too, became the second woman in the English department to receive tenure. A philologist who spoke eight languages, Dr. Metlitzki taught at Yale until she turned 70 in 1984. After retiring, she continued to lead seminars and remained an active scholar until her death.         Among her published works are ''The Matter of Araby in Medieval England'' (Yale University Press, 1977) and ''Melville's Orienda'' (Yale University Press, 1960).         Dr. Metlitzki married three times. She is survived by a daughter from her second marriage, Ruth Grdseloff, of Berkeley, Calif.       
         Sarah Tomerlin Lee, whose career in fashion, advertising, retailing and interior design spanned more than six decades, until her retirement three years ago, died on April 15 at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         Mrs. Lee, an imposing woman who was rarely seen without her pearls, came to New York in 1936 and quickly rose to prominence in the fashion world. Her experience writing advertising copy for a store her father managed in Utica, N.Y., paved the way for a job in the advertising department at Bonwit Teller, then a fashionable Fifth Avenue store.         For about 30 years, she shuttled between the advertising world, where she worked with Helena Rubenstein, Elizabeth Arden and Leona Helmsley, and magazine editing, where she became a colleague of major fashion figures, including Diana Vreeland and Carmel Snow. She was an editor at Vogue Magazine and then managing editor at Harper's Bazaar.         In 1960, she became a vice president of Lord & Taylor, in charge of advertising, promotion, display and public relations, and in 1965 she was named editor of House Beautiful, where she remained until 1971.         She met her husband, Tom Lee, in 1937 when she joined Bonwit Teller, where he was then display director. They were married a year later, and shortly after Mr. Lee left to start Tom Lee Ltd., a design company.         Mrs. Lee's career changed direction after the death of her husband in an automobile accident in 1971. She initially joined his firm to complete his contracts but stayed to carry on and expand the business, which concentrated on large interior design projects for hotels.         Under her leadership, the firm worked on the interior design of 40 hotels and inns in the United States, including the Helmsley Palace in Manhattan, the Willard in Washington and the Bellevue in Philadelphia. Other hotel commissions ranged from Canada to Australia.         From 1993 to 1997, she was head of the interior design division of the architectural firm of Beyer Blinder Belle, which restored Ellis Island and Grand Central Station.         Sarah Tomerlin was born on Aug. 18, 1910, in Union City, Tenn. She graduated from Randolph-Macon Women's College. Her survivors include two sons, Todd Granville Lee, of Boston, and Charles Tomerlin Lee, of Greenwich, Conn.; four grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         On behalf of the Fashion Institute of Technology, Mrs. Lee edited ''American Fashion: The Life and Times of Adrian, Mainbocher, McCardell, Norell, Trigère,'' a compilation of midcentury American clothing designers, published by The New York Times in 1975.         She was also president of the Fashion Group from 1960 to 1963 and was for a time president of the Decorators Club. She was a trustee of the New York School of Interior Design and a founder of the New York Landmarks Conservancy. In 1990 she was named a designer of distinction by the American Society of Interior Designers.       
         Arlene Francis, the actress and jaunty, good-natured television personality who was a fixture on ''What's My Line?'' for 25 years, died yesterday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 93.         Ms. Francis dispensed upbeat charm and humor on the show, which made her a national star. She wore stylish evening gowns and exchanged lighthearted banter with other panelists, including Steve Allen, Bennett Cerf and Dorothy Kilgallen. The panelists played a form of 20 Questions, interrogating guests about their professions.         The show ran from 1950 until 1975.  Ms. Francis also had a top-rated daily radio interview program, ''The Arlene Francis Show,'' on WOR from 1960 until 1984. She spoke to guests from all walks of life, opening the run with Rock Hudson. Among the others she interviewed were Frank Sinatra and the baseball player Curt Flood.         She was known for her pleasant interviewing style. Her radio producer, Jean Bach, recalled suggesting that Ms. Francis ask Barry Goldwater about gun control. Oh no, that might ruffle his feathers, Ms. Francis replied. ''I used to call her jokingly America's sweetheart, because she didn't want to offend anybody,'' Ms. Bach said.         Her interview style was breezy. ''She was a very good actress, and convinced the interviewee that she really cared,'' Ms. Bach said.         Soon after the radio program was canceled, Ms. Francis began showing signs of Alzheimer's disease, Ms. Bach said. She left New York six years ago and went to live in a retirement home in San Francisco to be closer to her son.         Ms. Francis also was a pioneer of morning television, appearing as the host of NBC's ''Home'' newsmagazine in the 1950's.         She also appeared in movies, including roles in ''All My Sons'' (1948), ''One Two Three'' (1961) and ''The Thrill of It All'' (1963).         Her first love was the stage, but television overtook her theater career. In a 1988 interview with Newsday, Ms. Francis said she somehow let the theater go. ''I don't know quite why,'' she said. ''Television took over with such strength. I was working in every phase of it and I thought, 'Maybe I ought to do this for a little while,' and I was caught up in it.''         But she said she had no regrets.         ''I got so much pleasure out of 'What's My Line?'. There were no rehearsals. You'd just sit there and be yourself and do the best you could,'' she said.         Ms. Francis was born Arlene Francis Kazanjian on Oct. 20, 1907, in Boston, the daughter of an Armenian immigrant. After a first marriage ended in divorce, she married the actor Martin Gabel, who died in 1986. She is survived by their son, Peter Gabel.       
         Carol Bernstein Ferry, who with her first and second husbands gave millions of dollars of inherited wealth to support causes like the Black Panthers, prisoners' rights and opposition to the Vietnam War, took her own life early Saturday morning at a retirement home in Rye, N.Y. She was 76.         After a lifetime of using money to make political points, Ms. Ferry made her final argument, for legalized euthanasia, by lying down as loved ones looked on and taking an overdose of sleeping pills. Last June, doctors told her that she was terminally ill. She had a tumor in her abdomen and failing lungs.         ''My decision has been arrived at after many years of contemplation, not quickly or casually,'' she wrote in a letter. ''I hope it will help others to feel all right about preferring a peaceful, benign path into death.''         At the height of her influence, she and her first husband, Daniel Bernstein, became known in leftist circles as the place to go for ''the loot,'' as she called it. For many years, she scoured the morning mail weighing requests for money for political causes. Sometimes she sent money without being asked. She visited many prisons, including Sing Sing, where for years she taught reading to inmates.         David McReynolds of the War Resisters League said her generosity was unconditional. ''They never attached a single thread to the money,'' he said.         Carol Underwood was born in Syracuse on July 29, 1924. She lived in Auburn, N.Y., until her parents divorced when she was 4. She grew up in Portland, Maine, and graduated from Wells College in Aurora, N.Y.         In 1946, she moved to Manhattan to work as a secretary, copy editor and proofreader for McGraw-Hill and other publishers. She met Mr. Bernstein, a stockbroker with Loeb Rhoades, and they were married in 1953.         While he was recuperating from knee surgery at their Scarsdale, N.Y., home in 1956, Mr. Bernstein decided to work as an independent stockbroker. He considered himself a liberal and had earlier helped set up the National Scholarship Fund and Service for Negro Students, working with Jim Robinson, a Harlem minister.         According to a daughter, Katharine Bernstein of Brattleboro, Vt., she had not initially been leftist but became increasingly persuaded by her husband's increasingly leftist opinions.         In 1960, he suggested an Easter family vacation to Cuba. His wife at first demurred. ''Would you have gone before the revolution?'' he asked.         She said yes and agreed to go. The couple returned so enthusiastic about Fidel Castro's revolution that most of Mr. Bernstein's brokerage clients dropped him.         Their political sensibilities moved ever leftward. Mr. Bernstein bought full-page advertisements in The New York Times to protest the Vietnam War.         One of their philanthropic vehicles was the DJB Foundation, which Mr. Bernstein created in 1948 to hold his father's inheritance. At first, it was relatively inactive, as Mr. Bernstein funneled money out of pocket to causes that were not tax deductible.         With Mr. Bernstein's death from leukemia in 1970 at 51, the foundation received $6 million of his wealth. It then became more active.         Vincent McGee, who in 1972 had just left federal prison after serving time for resisting the draft, asked for money to go to Hanoi to bring back some prisoners of war.         She responded by mail: ''Dear Vinny: Here's a check for $3,000. I am glad to send it. There are three things about this money business: asking, saying 'no,' or saying 'yes.' The first two are hard, but the third is easy when the purpose is good and the funds are there.''         Mr. McGee went on to work for DJB and then other foundations.         In 1973, she married Wilbur H. Ferry, a foundation employee who wrote books on the problems of a capitalist society. The couple spent DJB's money by May 1975, as planned, and then gave from their personal funds. He died in 1995, and Ms. Ferry continued the mission.         In addition to her daughter, Ms. Ferry is survived by a son, John Bernstein of Guilford, Vt.; four stepchildren, Dennie LaTourelle of Carpenteria, Calif., Fay Bisno of Norwich, Vt., Robin Ferry of Salt Spring Island, British Columbia, and Lucien Ferry of Blue Sea Lake, Quebec; and a brother, Arthur Underwood of Denver.       
         Arlene Francis, the actress and jaunty, good-natured television personality who was a fixture on ''What's My Line?'' for 25 years, died on Thursday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 93.         Ms. Francis dispensed upbeat charm and humor on the show, which made her a national star. She wore stylish evening dresses and exchanged lighthearted banter with other panelists, who played a form of 20 questions, interrogating guests about their professions.         The actress, along with Dorothy Kilgallen and Bennett Cerf, appeared on the show for 15 years, with John Daly as the genial moderator. Steve Allen and Fred Allen also were panelists for a brief period in the 1950's. After the original ''What's My Line?'' ended its run in 1967, the show was revived as a syndicated series the next year. Ms. Francis was the new show's only panelist from the old one, and it had a new host, Walter Bruner.         Ms. Francis also had a top-rated daily radio interview program, ''The Arlene Francis Show,'' on WOR in New York from 1960 to 1984. She spoke to guests from all walks of life, opening the run with Rock Hudson. Among others she interviewed were Frank Sinatra and the baseball player Curt Flood.         She was known for her pleasant interviewing style. Her radio producer, Jean Bach, recalled suggesting that Ms. Francis ask Barry Goldwater about gun control.

She also appeared in movies, including roles in ''All My Sons'' (1948), ''One, Two, Three'' (1961) and ''The Thrill of It All'' (1963).         Her first love was the stage, where her Broadway credits included ''All That Glitters'' (1938), ''The Walking Gentleman'' (1942), ''The Overtons'' (1945) and ''The Little Blue Light'' (1951), in which she appeared with Melvyn Douglas, Burgess Meredith and her husband, Martin Gabel.         But television overtook her theater career. In a 1988 interview with Newsday, Ms. Francis said she somehow let the theater go. ''I don't know quite why,'' she said. ''Television took over with such strength. I was working in every phase of it, and I thought, 'Maybe I ought to do this for a little while,' and I was caught up in it.''

After a first marriage ended in divorce, she married Mr. Gabel, who died in 1986. She is survived by their son, Peter.       
         Yvonne Dionne, a member of the first recorded set of quintuplets to survive more than a few days, died on Saturday morning in a Montreal hospital. She was 67.         She died of cancer, said Carlo Tarini, a family spokesman.         When they were born in 1934 to an already large, poor farm family in Callander, in Ontario, Yvonne, Emilie, Marie, Cecile and Annette together weighed 13 and a half pounds on an old potato scale.         They developed from a single egg before the days of fertility treatments, and became instantly famous, seemingly a cheery miracle in the midst of the Great Depression.         But, isolated from playmates and their own parents, they did not share that cheer. Quintland, the residence-cum-sideshow where paying visitors could view them three times a day through one-way glass, outstripped Niagara Falls as a Canadian tourist attraction.         The Canadian ''Little Women'' brought an estimated $500 million to Ontario over the nearly 20 years they lived there.         They met the Queen of England, christened warships and graced the cover of Life magazine, but when Yvonne first left home at 19, Mr. Tarini recalled her saying, she could not tell the difference between a nickel and a dime.         ''Multiple births should not be confused with entertainment, nor should they be an opportunity to sell products,'' she and her two surviving quintuplets wrote in an open letter to the parents of the McCaughey septuplets that was published in Time magazine in 1997. ''Our lives have been ruined by the exploitation we suffered.''         The first inkling of their profit potential came shortly after their birth when their father, Oliva, signed a contract to display them at the Chicago World's Fair. Public outrage ensued, and the government took the ''quints'' from their parents' care. At Quintland, the doctor who delivered them, Allan Dafoe, became their primary caretaker.         But that did not protect them from becoming a sideshow. The Dionne sisters appeared in advertisements for everything from Puretest Cod Liver Oil to Lysol and Palmolive. Because the rights to their image had been sold, they said later, their parents were not allowed to photograph them and visits from Oliva and their mother, Elzier, were discouraged.         Meanwhile, Dr. Dafoe became one of the world's most celebrated doctors, writing newspaper columns on the quints' daily schedule and even about the pebbles in Callander, which were said to enhance fertility. In 1936 the quints appeared in their first of several movies, ''The Country Doctor,'' based on the life of Dr. Dafoe.         Even their exploitation, seemingly, was exploited, in books like ''The Dionne Legend: Quintuplets in Captivity.'' In 1965, the sisters published their own plaintive memoirs: ''We Were Five: the Dionne Quintuplets' Story.'' In 1998, they sued the government for the separation from their parents and won $4 million.         After a custody battle, their father regained custody of them from the state when they were nearly 10 years old. But in a second book, ''Family Secrets: the Dionne Quintuplets' Autobiography,'' published in 1994, the three surviving quintuplets said that he had sexually abused them, an accusation that their other siblings denied.         The sisters, raised Roman Catholic, were in and out of convents, both as students and initiates. At 20, Emilie died of suffocation during an epileptic seizure.         At 21, the remaining sisters each got $250,000 from a trust fund of their childhood earnings, and shortly afterward they took a determined stab at normalcy, moving into an apartment in Montreal and thus beginning a long estrangement from their parents.         Three of the sisters eventually married and had children, later divorcing. Marie, who had been hospitalized for nervous depression and had placed her two daughters in foster care, died in 1970 of a blood clot. Yvonne is survived by Annette and Cecile Dionne and five of eight other siblings.         Yvonne Dionne, considered the most artistic of the sisters, made several attempts to join a convent before settling in St. Bruno in the home of her sister, Annette. She became a librarian and lobbied the government on behalf of the Duplessis Orphans, children, many of whom were born out of wedlock, who were placed in psychiatric wards in the 1950's, Mr. Tarini said.         She also traveled to Europe and India.         Cecile Dionne once called Yvonne ''the most reserved and perhaps the most individual of us.''       
         Modjadji V, the last of a line of rain queens and the only woman who was a tribal ruler in modern-day southern Africa, died on Thursday in a clinic in Petersburg, South Africa. She was 64.         Although modern meteorology and politics have robbed the mysterious Modjadjis of the awe that once protected their tiny tribe, the Lobedu, her death created a succession crisis. Her 20-year-old granddaughter, Makhaele, who was to have succeeded her as Modjadji VI, died on Monday. Makhaele's mother died years ago.         The queen died of renal and heart failure, according to the Pietersburg Medi-Clinic. The cause of the younger woman's death has been given only as ''a short illness.''         A spokesman said the family was upset that the world had been notified before succession could be discussed or funeral arrangements made. Although Modjadji V refused to discuss ceremonial secrets, a 1937 anthropological text says the queens' decaying bodies were stored for weeks and water poured over them to create a rain-making potion. The earliest Modjadjis were never seen and were said to be immortal.         For generations, the Lobedu were left unmolested by more powerful neighbors, the Zulu and Swazi, for fear of their queens' power over the rains. In times of drought, caravans of gifts were sent up to their village, also called Modjadji, in the Drakensberg Mountains. The high valley around the village is sort of a climatic anomaly: set on dry slopes above a drier plain, it squeezes enough rain from the clouds blown off the Indian Ocean to grow bananas. The nearby Modjadji Forest is full of rare cycads, fern-like trees that date to the time of the dinosaurs.         Anthropological texts say the line of Modjadjis started in 1800, when Mugodo, a chief of the Dzugudini tribe, had a vision that he must marry his daughter and found a female dynasty. Oral tradition is grander: it says the Lobedu come from ancient Ethiopia and built the stone fortress of Great Zimbabwe.         Officially, no Modjadji marries a man; like African kings, they take several spouses, but bear children by secret consorts.         The queen, a spokesman said, is both a secular and religious leader, and is ''mother, father and child -- three persons in one.''         Although she was visited by leaders of African Christian sects, Modjadji V was not Christian. ''I am baptized by my own god,'' she said in an interview.         Four years ago, Modjadji said no one any longer asked her to make rain; young people, she complained, had lost touch with religion. That created financial problems. Her office demanded cash gifts of about $50 for interviews, and she was not shy about counting the money herself before saying a word. She owned a leopard-skin cloak that had been in the family for five generations but could be found sitting barefoot on the mud stoop of her thatched reception hut.         Although she had asked the provincial government to encourage tourism to her village, she had little patience with visitors and is still famous for having kept President Nelson Mandela waiting.         He was not the first political visitor. White presidents paid obeisance even in the days when blacks could not vote. F. W. de Klerk visited her when he was president, and his predecessor, P. W. Botha, visited her mother. Zanele Mbeki, wife of President Thabo Mbeki, is expected to attend her funeral on Sunday.         Unseasonable rains hit Johannesburg on Thursday and continued this evening.         Correction:  July 13, 2001, Friday  An obituary on June 30 about Modjadji V, a rain queen and tribal ruler in South Africa, misidentified the member of her family who died a few days before she did. It was her daughter, Mmakheala, not her granddaughter, Makobo.       
         Imogene Coca, the saucer-eyed, rubber-faced comedian who teamed with Sid Caesar on NBC's ''Your Show of Shows'' and kept America's Saturday night television audiences in stitches for five years in the early 1950's, died yesterday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 92.         Her leer was superb, her wink epochal. Her eyebrow could rise to moronic bewilderment or descend to gold digger torch time. Her chin could jut out with the indignation of a dowager caught cheating at canasta or vanish into the pathos of an abandoned woman. And the wide, silent mouth could curl into almost anything: outrage, boredom, smugness, sweet innocence, and on and on.         To millions, that face -- elfin, mischievous, wistful -- was the funniest thing on television in television's golden age. With Mr. Caesar, who was the top star and got most of the punch lines, Ms. Coca spoofed movies, society matrons, marital bliss and everyday life with extraordinary pantomimes, with a chanteuse voice that seemed always on the edge of a screech, with toe dances that laid waste to Debussy's ''Afternoon of a Faun.''         A child of vaudeville performers who lived out of a trunk and put her on the stage as an 11-year-old song-and-dance girl, Ms. Coca drifted from nightclubs in the 1920's to variety shows and Broadway revues in the 1930's. She was often out of work until her television career began, and then it was rags to riches: $10,000 a week, a $1 million contract.         From 1949, when they began tickling television audiences in the ''Admiral Broadway Revue,'' the forerunner of ''Your Show of Shows,'' to 1954, when they split up, Ms. Coca and Mr. Caesar were one of television's most hilarious and successful combinations, reaching peak audiences of more than 25 million people that swamped the competition.         ''Your Show of Shows'' did more than dominate the Saturday night viewing habits of the American household. The 90-minute show started the careers of some of the nation's most successful writers and performers and set comedic standards that gave rise to Carol Burnett, Gilda Radner, Lily Tomlin and others. For many viewers old enough to remember, the show still represents television comedy at its most inventive.         Sex, politics and religion were out of bounds for television comedy in that era. So ''Your Show of Shows,'' which also starred Carl Reiner and Howard Morris and at various times counted Mel Brooks, Neil Simon and Woody Allen among its writers, had to be fashioned out of the broader terrain of everyday life, which gave the comedy a timeless, classic quality.         Blending lunatic fantasy and more contortions than a fun house mirror, Ms. Coca caricatured the foibles of housewives, spinsters, opera singers, ballet dancers, pouting flappers and haughty socialites, while Mr. Caesar provided the stoicism of a luckless schlemazel and wacky foreign accents -- memorably, a fastidious Prussian with a ''geschmutzik'' monocle who dons a bemedaled tunic and braided military cap and barks orders at his aide-de-camp: ''Brushin' a Prussian!'' ''Perfuma-schpritzen!'' -- then marches off to his job as a doorman.         The sketches were never about very much, often just an idea: a wife trying to hide the fact that she has just smashed up her husband's car, a roof leaking on an elegant dinner party, a catered boardroom lunch that lurches into chaos over who gets the chopped liver as a slavering chairman lusts after a pickle wagged by his vice chairman.         In one pantomime, Ms. Coca, Mr. Caesar, Mr. Reiner and Mr. Morris were life-size mechanical figures on a Bavarian town clock, trotting out to strike the hours -- hammer on anvil, a splash of water from a dipper, a wheezing bellows -- until the thing goes madly, progressively to pieces, leaving all the quaint lederhosen figures drenched, battered and sprung.         In another, Ms. Coca was a wife posing for her amateur photographer husband, who could not quite satisfy himself about her face. Poking here, pushing there, he kept rearranging her features, which froze where he put them. Finally, he got it right: her left eye shut in a grotesque wink, the right following him around the room like a searchlight. The husband-and-wife routines -- dubbed ''The Hickenloopers'' -- became a staple of marital rapture and catastrophe.         In ''The Sewing Machine Girl,'' a sendup of sweatshops, Ms. Coca, with Mr. Reiner as a badgering, leering boss, worked faster and faster, drooping lower and lower, until at last she gave up, did a whirling dervish dance of consumption, collapsed in death throes and, sprouting wings, flew up to heaven on wires.         In ''From Here to Obscurity,'' a parody of Fred Zinnemann's film ''From Here to Eternity,'' Ms. Coca played the hard, innocent bar girl and Mr. Caesar her boxing-bugler soldier, tragic lovers in Hawaii on the eve of war. At last, they are alone together on a beach, in swimsuits under the moonlight. You can hear the romantic music, the waves rolling in.         ''I love you,'' she says passionately.         They start to embrace.         And water -- about a bucketful -- splashes in their faces.         ''I love you,'' he says gamely.         Dripping, bedraggled, shivering, she can hardly keep a straight face as another bucketful hits them.         ''There's one thing I have to ask,'' he says.         ''Yes?''         ''Did you bring a towel?''         Ms. Coca's musical satire came from a well-trained but not powerful voice. She could turn a Wagner aria into a nightmare of brow-knitted concentration, quavering glissandos and narrow escapes from tonal disaster -- just the reverse of a young singer approaching a difficult passage, the mezzo-soprano Risë Stevens once said. ''You're always deathly afraid the young singer will never make the last note,'' she said. ''With Imogene, you're always afraid she will.''         Her dance spoofs were also a result of years of training, and were far more subtle than most audiences realized, extracting humor not by stumbling around but by finely exaggerated professional movements. In ''Afternoon of a Faun,'' she traipsed off in amorous pursuit of a prancing satyr, eventually making her capture by pouring salt from a shaker over his little goat tail.         But it was Ms. Coca's flexible face and her talents as a pantomime that delighted most audiences. ''Imogene can look so abandoned that you wonder if she ever had anybody to abandon her in the first place,'' a friend said. And Max Liebman, who produced and directed ''Your Show of Shows'' for NBC, said, ''The great thing about Imogene is that one nostril never knows what the other is doing.''         At the height of her success, Ms. Coca, who won an Emmy as the best actress of 1951, was making $10,000 a week. After ''Your Show of Shows'' ended in 1954, NBC gave Ms. Coca her own half-hour show and a 10-year, $1 million contract. She was paid half that sum in the first year, but her show faltered and she gave up the balance of the contract.         Ms. Coca subsequently appeared in nightclubs, Broadway plays, films and many television specials. In 1958, she and Mr. Caesar were reunited for an ABC program that ran 18 weeks. And in 1967, ''The Sid Caesar, Imogene Coca, Carl Reiner, Howard Morris Special'' won an Emmy Award for the year's best variety show. But, critics said, the old Caesar-Coca magic was not quite there.         From 1950 to 1954, they had made 160 editions of ''Your Show of Shows.'' Those were the years before videotape, when television was live and programs -- classics or not -- vanished into the ether. But Mr. Liebman, the producer, kept ''Your Show of Shows'' on kinescopes, 16-millimeter films.         Last year, like a long-delayed punch line, the staff of the City Center in Manhattan found 47 dusty boxes of long-lost scripts and other memorabilia (but no kinescopes) from ''Your Show of Shows,'' the ''Admiral Broadway Revue'' and other pioneering television productions. They had been stashed away in a closet in an office suite where Mr. Caesar, Ms. Coca and their writers created shows, and had apparently lain undisturbed for nearly 40 years.         In 1973, Mr. Liebman and Mr. Caesar created and released ''Ten From 'Your Show of Shows,' '' a selection of some of the best skits in a 35-millimeter enlargement that went into the nation's movie houses and was enthusiastically received by critics and audiences. Videotapes have since made ''Ten From 'Your Show of Shows' '' widely available to a new generation of fans.         Among its offerings, ''At the Movies'': A poor sap (Mr. Caesar) goes into a theater to relax. He chews 10 sticks of gum while eating handfuls of popcorn. A woman (Ms. Coca) comes in and sits next to him. She begins to squirm and fidget with her skirt. Soon, they are both squirming and fidgeting.         Her jealous boyfriend (Mr. Reiner) enters and accuses them of meeting secretly. The lovers quarrel. The sap moves over one seat, trying to stay out of it. To defy her boyfriend, she moves over and kisses him. (''I'll kiss the fathead if I want!'') Enraged boyfriend attacks unresisting sap. Finally, the lovers make up and depart, arm in arm, leaving the bystander mauled and in tatters.         In 1963, Ms. Coca starred with Jack Lemmon in the film ''Under the Yum Yum Tree'' and in a television comedy called ''Grindl,'' about the adventures of a maid. She later appeared in nightclubs and regional playhouses and in 1979 was in a Broadway revival of ''On the Twentieth Century.''         Imogene Coca was born in Philadelphia on Nov. 18, 1908, the daughter of José Fernandez de Coca, a violinist and vaudeville band leader, and Sadie Brady Coca, a dancer who also performed in a magician's act.         When the Cocas were not on the road, home was a tumultuous Philadelphia household where singers, dancers, actors, gag men and acrobats kept life in a constant swirl. An only child, Imogene spent her early years in the theaters where her parents worked. At the age of 5, she began piano lessons; at 6, singing lessons, and at 7 dancing lessons.         She went to school in Atlantic City for several years, but by the age of 11 was performing in vaudeville. At 13, she was singing in a slinky black dress at the Dixie in Manayunk, Pa., and at 15 was performing in Jimmy Durante's Silver Slipper Club in New York. She made her Broadway debut at 17 in the chorus line of ''When You Smile'' in 1925.         For years, she bounced from show to show, when employed at all. Finally she got a lucky break. Shivering in a chilly theater while rehearsing for Leonard Sillman's ''New Faces of 1934,'' Ms. Coca, a lesser light to Henry Fonda and other young stars, wrapped herself in someone's huge coat and began clowning around: a fan dance with flapping ends. Mr. Sillman saw it and put it in the show. The show flopped, but critics hailed Ms. Coca as a rising comedian.         In another flop, ''Fools Rush In,'' she met Robert Burton, an actor. They were married the day after the play closed in 1935. Mr. Burton, who became a record company executive, died in 1955. In 1960, Ms. Coca married King Donovan, an actor she had met on a summer theater tour. They often performed together in plays and variety shows. Mr. Donovan died in 1987.         Ms. Coca had no survivors.         A small woman -- 5 feet 3 and 100 pounds -- Ms. Coca was shy offstage, a gentle, unassuming, sensitive person, friends said.         Someone who worked with her remembered that once in the chaos of a rehearsal for ''Your Show of Shows'' on a night when the cast was tired and nerves were frayed, when lines were lost and nobody believed it would all come together for the cameras at 9, Ms. Coca suddenly twisted her face into an appalling moue.         The tension dissolved in an uproar of laughter.         ''She had the wonderful faculty of understanding,'' the friend said.         Correction:  June 7, 2001, Thursday  An obituary of the comedian Imogene Coca on Sunday referred incorrectly to a Broadway production of ''On the 20th Century'' in which she appeared. It was the original one, which opened in 1978, not a 1979 revival.       
         Rosemary Verey, the tough, artistic English gardener who brought the art of clipped boxwoods, laburnum walks and ornamental vegetable gardening to America, died in Chelsea Memorial Hospital in London on May 31. She was 82.         ''She was a marvelous lecturer and she knew so much,'' said Gregory Long, the president of the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. He first heard her speak about her famous garden at Barnsley House, a 17th-century rectory in the Cotswolds of England, about 20 years ago at the Horticultural Alliance of the Hamptons.         The four-acre garden was her working laboratory, where she domesticated elements from legendary gardens, like the yellow-flowering laburnum arch at the National Trust's Bodnant Garden, in North Wales, or the ornamental potager, or vegetable garden, at the Chateau de Villandry, in the Loire Valley in France, and made them seem possible for the home gardener.         Mr. Long remembers staring longingly at the slides of the neo-Classical temple that Mrs. Verey's husband, David Verey, an architectural historian, had dismantled in an English park and rebuilt himself, stone by stone.         ''It was a really good lesson in garden-building,'' Mr. Long said. ''None of this redwood pergola stuff from catalogues.''         Years later, when he became the president of the New York Botanical Garden, he would ask her to design an ornamental vegetable garden for the Bronx, complete with cold frames for extending the seasons and herbs that are used by gardeners from other cultures. She was working on the design with the sculptor Simon Verity the week that she died of pneumonia, possibly contracted while flying to Cincinnati and on to Kentucky to work on gardens there.         She was mentor to many American garden leaders like Marco Polo Stufano, who transformed Wave Hill, the public garden in the Riverdale section of the Bronx; Robert Dash, the painter who created the Madoo Conservancy, on the East End of Long Island, and Mr. Long.         Ms. Verey wrote more than a dozen garden books including ''The Classic Garden'' and ''The Garden in Winter,'' which were seminal works for Americans interested in design and sophisticated use of plants, with color and texture year-round.         In her later years, she designed gardens for British celebrities like Prince Charles and Elton John. But her favorite people were gardeners. She often gave them cuttings and seeds from plants she herself had clipped or gathered from such legendary gardens as Gethsemane, outside the city of Jerusalem, or Monet's garden at Giverny.         For more than 20 years she redesigned the grounds around Barnsley House, which is near Cirencester, in Gloucestershire, first with her laburnum arch, which dangles chains of gold flowers over purple alliums in May. Her husband laid the path beneath, a mosaic of colorful stone and pebbles collected from the Pembrokeshire beaches.         ''She had an impeccable eye for color, an ability to embroider gold against purple,'' said Mr. Dash, whose gardens at Madoo, in Sagaponack, N.Y., are widely considered an American work of art. ''She took that grim forbidding aristocratic face off English gardening, and with her charm and her writings, gave it a friendly, domesticated face.''         Mr. Dash and Ms. Verey would occasionally lecture together, playfully arguing over whose garden was more original and just who stole from whom. Did Ms. Verey really swipe her famous laburnum arch from Bodnant?         ''Of course!'' Mr. Dash said, laughing. ''But my laburnum arch bears no resemblance to hers. It's a question of following your own light.''         She studied mathematics and economics at University College in London, but left before earning her degree to marry Mr. Verey in 1939, and proceeded to raise four children, like a proper English gentlewoman of her day. She was an accomplished horsewoman, until she fell in a hunting accident.         ''A horse rolled over on her,'' Mr. Dash said. ''So her husband gave her a book on mandrakes that piqued her interest.'' And a temple just to get her started.         A scholar and perfectionist, she began to read widely, collecting rare first editions usually seen only in the British Museum or the Royal Horticultural Society's Lindley Library. Her redesign project began in 1950, and the grounds opened to the public in 1970. By the time her husband died in 1984, she had started a new career, and a garden that would eventually attract 30,000 visitors a year.         She lectured widely in the United States, where she made five or six trips a year to cities like New York, Seattle, Atlanta or Chicago, or to Indiana and Kentucky. ''Flower shows in winter and the garden clubs in spring and summer,'' Mr. Long said. ''We began to see a lot of laburnum arches in the Hamptons.''         She took many young gardeners under her wing, drilling them in the Latin names of plants, and shooing them off for the day to plunge into the great gardens of England.         ''She would get very cross with us if we didn't speak to the head gardener,'' recalled Mr. Stufano, who with his companion, John Nally, spent many days in the gardens at Barnsley. ''Her garden was a very personal garden. She was always trying new things. It had the feeling of someone who loved plants and she was out in it constantly. She was a wonderful cook and one of my fond memories is being sent out to the garden for a few marrows, or zucchinis, for dinner.''         Long before Mr. Long became president of the New York Botanical Garden, he made a gardener's pilgrimage to Barnsley, to learn some secrets for his place upstate. He had been happily wandering about in the rain, poking about as gardeners do, when he saw her looking out the window.         ''She was so imposing in those days, I was a bit intimidated by her,'' he said. ''I almost wished that she not come out. She showed me Phlomis fruticosa, which is a silver-leafed thing with yellow flowers in the fall. I tried to grow it at home and couldn't.''         Then she locked the gate and invited him in for drinks. Years later, at his own garden upstate, she sat on his compost pile and showed him how to dry the bulbs he had carelessly thrown away. They bloomed the next year.         Her influence was not restricted to naïve Americans. David Wheeler, the editor of Hortus, a garden quarterly in England, who has built, with the artist Simon Dorell, a garden on the edge of Wales, was also nurtured by Ms. Verey, who opened up her library, garden and larder to him.         She was a great networker, or Miss Fix-It, as Mr. Wheeler put it. When he admitted that he would like to meet Prince Charles, she simply rang him up. ''Be here at 5,'' she said.'' ''We're expected at Highgrove at 6.''         Her vegetable garden, a tapestry of ever-changing cabbages, lettuces, strawberries, hop vines and espaliered fruit trees, ''has become a cliché copied around the world,'' Mr. Wheeler said. ''But she made us look at growing vegetables in these times of peace and well-being. We were no longer digging for victory and growing rows of vegetables. We could do this decoratively.''         She also reinvented the formal garden, he said, with little parterres of clipped boxwood. ''Those had been part of the English garden since Elizabethan times,'' he said, ''but it had all but washed away with modernism and the 20th century.''         In 1999, Ms. Verey received a special award from the Massachusetts Horticultural Society for her work with English gardens, and the same year, was given the Royal Horticultural Society's most distinguished award, the Victoria Medal of Honor.         She leaves two sons and two daughters. Over the last two years, her son Charles has overseen the gardens, which are still open to the public. ''But the eye is gone,'' Mr. Dash said. ''The artist is gone.''       
         Lyubov Sokolova, a Russian actress whose roles in more than 300 movies in the years after World War II shaped the image of the Soviet wife and mother, died on June 6 at her home in Moscow. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack, according to the German newspaper Die Welt.         Die Welt said of Miss Sokolova that in the postwar years, ''None of her Russian women colleagues formed as she did the image of the woman -- which was also propagandistically polished up, to be sure.''         She was one of only three professional performers in the 1967 Soviet movie ''Asya's Happiness,'' set on a collective farm. One of her best-known films, it was shown at the New York Film Festival in 1988. She also appeared in a 1965 Soviet movie that has been shown under the English titles ''Workers' Quarters'' and ''Workers' Settlement.'' It was shown at the Locarno Film Festival last August.         After Miss Sokolova's death, The Moscow Times called her ''Soviet cinematography's ultimate strong woman with a hard life.'' Her final movie, made last year, is titled ''The Agonies of Love.''         There was also drama in her real life. During the Nazi siege of Leningrad in World War II, when she was working in a factory and also training to become a teacher, her first husband, Georgi Arapovsky, and her mother-in-law starved to death.         After the war, when she had begun acting in films, she married a prominent director, Georgi Daneliya. He left her for another woman after more than two decades of marriage. Their son died in 1985.         Lyubov Sergeyevna Sokolova was born in the industrial city of Ivanovo, 198 miles northeast of Moscow. Her mother sold fabrics in a store. Her father was a carpenter.         As a girl, she was a theater buff and performed in school plays. In 1948, she acted in her first movie, ''The Genuine Human Being.'' As an established actress with a kindly face and large, handsome eyes, she was so helpful to fledgling performers that she acquired the nickname Mama.       
         Katharine Graham, who transformed The Washington Post from a mediocre newspaper into an American institution and, in the process, transformed herself from a shy widow into a publishing legend, died yesterday after suffering head injuries in a fall on a sidewalk on Saturday in Idaho. She was 84.         Mrs. Graham had been attending a business conference in Sun Valley. She was flown to a hospital in Boise, where she underwent brain surgery but never recovered consciousness, her son Donald E. Graham said.         Mrs. Graham was one of the most powerful figures in American journalism and, for the last decades of her life, at the pinnacle of Washington's political and social establishments, a position this insecure wife and mother never imagined she would, or could, occupy.         It was only after she succeeded her father and her husband as president and later publisher of The Washington Post, a newspaper with a modest circulation and more modest reputation, that it moved into the front rank of American newspapers, reaching new heights when its unrelenting reporting of the Watergate scandal contributed to the resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974.         Mrs. Graham's courage in supporting her reporters and editors through the long investigation was critical to its success. Three years before Watergate, she gave solid backing to The New York Times in a historic confrontation with the government when she permitted her editors to join in publishing the secret revelations about the war in Vietnam known as the Pentagon Papers.         Mrs. Graham would have been the first to say the single greatest decision of her professional career was not in publishing the Pentagon Papers nor in exposing the Watergate scandal but in hiring Benjamin C. Bradlee to be her editor. With her support he forged a staff of reporters and editors that made The Washington Post a force in the capital and in the world of journalism.         Mrs. Graham capped her career when she was 80 years old in 1998 by winning a Pulitzer Prize for biography for her often painful reminiscence, ''Personal History'' (Alfred A. Knopf). Nora Ephron, in her review of the best-selling memoir in The New York Times Book Review, wrote of Mrs. Graham, ''The story of her journey from daughter to wife to widow to woman parallels to a surprising degree the history of women in this century.''         Mrs. Graham was a socialite mother of four when her husband, Philip L. Graham, committed suicide in 1963. Her father had given Mr. Graham control of The Post and when the latter died, his widow found herself in a mysterious thicket of corporate politics dominated by men unaccustomed to a woman in the boardroom and highly skeptical of her ability to run a newspaper.         Mrs. Graham saw herself at best as only as an interim caretaker who would try to hold on to The Post for her children. She became something quite different -- the effective steward of a multimillion-dollar communications empire.         ''It's sort of like a fairy tale,'' Mrs. Graham said on being told of her Pulitzer Prize. But her life was its own sort of fairy tale.         She was born in New York City on June 16, 1917. Her father, Eugene Meyer, made his fortune on Wall Street, became a governor of the Federal Reserve Bank, went on to organize the Reconstruction Finance Corporation and was appointed the first president of the World Bank. Her mother, the former Agnes Ernst, was a tall, self-absorbed woman of intellectual and artistic ambition. She was scathingly critical and often harsh with her daughter, the fourth of five children.         The children were brought up in the traditions of St. John's Episcopal Church in Washington, the church of presidents, where the Meyers -- Mr. Meyer was Jewish, his wife Lutheran -- had their own pew. Mrs. Graham remembered a lonely childhood in palatial houses in Mount Kisco, N.Y., and in Washington. Her father was often away working, her mother traveling and writing  letters home about her social conquests.         In the absence of maternal warmth and support, Katharine became attached to her governess. Later, she went to the Madeira School for Girls in Virginia. She spent two years at Vassar before transferring to the University of Chicago. Neither of her parents attended her graduation in 1938.         When Katharine was 16, no one thought to tell her that her father had bid $825,000 at public auction to buy the bankrupt Washington Post, a paper with a circulation of 50,000 that was losing a million dollars a year, the fifth newspaper in a five-newspaper town. Later, with yearnings of her own to get into journalism, she took a job at The San Francisco News before going to The Post to work on the editorial page and handle letters to the editor. ''If it doesn't work, we'll get rid of her,'' her father said.         'The Tail to His Kite'         Washington, in 1939, was full of young people converging on the capital to work for The New Deal. Among them was Philip L. Graham of Florida, a brilliant lawyer and a clerk at the Supreme Court, first for Justice Stanley Reed and then for Felix Frankfurter. Shy and insecure, Katharine Meyer could not believe her luck when he asked her to marry him. The heiress agreed to his terms -- that they return to Florida and his father's dairy business, provided, she remembered, that ''I could live with only two dresses because I had to understand that he would never take anything from my father or be involved with him and we would live on what he made.''         It did not work out that way, and Mr. Graham soon accepted his father-in-law's invitation to join The Post. He became associate publisher at 30 and publisher at 31. Mr. Meyer also arranged for him to hold more stock in the company than his daughter because, he explained to her, ''no man should be in the position of working for his wife.'' Mrs. Graham did not object because she knew how important it was to her father to keep The Post in the family, and, she wrote, ''in those days, of course, the only possible heir would have been a male.''         Mrs. Graham was belittled and silenced by a husband she adored, the man she called ''the fizz'' in her life. When he drank too much, gave vent to his rage or frequently became ill, she attributed it to the pressure of his work and not to a serious emotional affliction that had not yet been identified.         ''Our relationship resembled that of a chief executive officer Phil and a chief operating officer me,'' Mrs. Graham wrote in her memoir. In addition to handling all domestic matters, she paid all their living expenses from her own trust fund so her husband could pay back the debt he incurred buying even more Post stock.         Mr. Graham was immersed in building up The Washington Post, conducting negotiations to buy the rival Times-Herald and merging it with his paper, and waging political battles as The Post took on Senator Joseph McCarthy and his brand of anti-communism. Later Mr. Graham became an even more influential figure in Washington, a close friend of President John F. Kennedy and Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson.         ''I increasingly saw my role as the tail to his kite and the more I felt overshadowed, the more it became a reality,'' Mrs. Graham wrote.         Mr. Graham had his first breakdown in 1957. His recovery was slow, but he eventually re-emerged into Washington life. In 1961, at the urging of Mr. Bradlee, then a young reporter at Newsweek, he negotiated the purchase of the weekly newsmagazine. He also added television stations to the company's holdings.         What his wife later described as his ''hyperactivity, rage and irrationality'' grew. Mrs. Graham was shattered when she discovered that her husband was having an affair with a Newsweek employee. But there was an added blow: she discovered he had a scheme to pay her off and take ownership of The Post, in which he already had controlling interest because her father had given him the majority of Class A shares.         But she decided to fight back. She resolved not to give her husband a divorce unless he gave up enough controlling stock in the Post to give her majority interest.         Mr. Graham became increasingly ill and was in and out of a mental hospital. Finally, his illness had a name, manic depression. The kinds of drugs that were later developed for his condition were not available then, and Mr. Graham, on the advice of his psychiatrist, refused such drugs that were in use. In August 1963, while on a weekend leave from the hospital, Philip Graham, then 48 years old, took one of his hunting rifles and shot himself to death at their farm in Virginia.         Holding On to The Post         As she mourned, the 46-year-old widow sought ways to hold on to The Post until her sons were old enough to run it. (Her daughter was not a candidate in her plan.) Mrs. Graham wrote that she was startled when her friend Luvie Pearson, the wife of the columnist Drew Pearson, told her to run the paper herself. ''Don't be silly, dear. You can do it,'' Mrs. Pearson told her. ''You've got all those genes. . . . You've just been pushed down so far you don't recognize what you can do.''         Mrs. Graham met with the directors of The Post a month after her husband's death and told them that the paper would not be sold and that it would remain in the family. She was elected president of the company, but she felt ''abysmally ignorant'' about how to proceed.         She said she was embarrassed to talk to her own reporters, timid in dealing with the paper's executives and uncomfortable with balance sheets. Both at The Post and in the wider journalistic community, Mrs. Graham was usually the only woman at meetings and dinners. The men hardly knew what to make of her.         Although she had absorbed a great deal over the years from both her father and her husband, she did not feel up to the job as she tried to learn from the top. With the advice and support of friends like the columnists Walter Lippmann and James Reston, she began to feel some level of comfort at The Post, but she still felt shaky at Newsweek, where she went through a series of hirings and firings that some staff members recall as creating havoc at the magazine.         Two years after taking over The Post, she hired Mr. Bradlee, Newsweek's Washington bureau chief, to be deputy managing editor and then quickly moved him up to executive editor. They made a formidable team, propelling The Post into one of its most dynamic periods. With Mrs. Graham's backing, Mr. Bradlee forged a staff of reporters and editors and put out a breezy, gutsy paper that investigated government with gusto. A saucy, impertinent Style section appeared that would soon be imitated by competitors but never matched.         Mr. Bradlee's brassy style galvanized his staff and invigorated his publisher.         'The Most Powerful Woman'         As Mrs. Graham struggled to take hold at The Post, she slowly started putting her personal life together. Truman Capote gave what could only be called a coming-out party for her, the Black and White Ball at the Plaza in New York, which was not only  the social event of the 1966 season, but also a masked ball of such glamour that it is considered one of the legendary parties of the 20th century.         She wrote, ''For one magic night I was transformed.''         Mrs. Graham's memoir quoted Gerald Clarke, one of Mr. Capote's biographers, as saying: ''She was arguably the most powerful woman in the country, but still largely unknown outside Washington. Putting her in the spotlight was also his ultimate act as Pygmalion. It would symbolize her emergence from her dead husband's shadow; she would become her own woman before the entire world.''         In 1969, and still with considerable trepidation, Mrs. Graham added the title of publisher to her position as president of the Washington Post Company.         In June 1971, The New York Times started publishing the secret history of decision-making during the Vietnam War known as the Pentagon Papers. After a few days, a federal judge put The Times under a temporary restraining order, the first time in American history that such an order of prior restraint had been imposed.         The editors and reporters at The Post scrambled to get their own copy of the Pentagon Papers. There was a crisis atmosphere, for at the same time the Washington Post Company was in the process of being taken public, raising concerns that the company could face harsh retribution from federal regulators if it published the Pentagon Papers while The New York Times was enjoined. When The Post obtained its own copy, it was left to Mrs. Graham, as publisher, to decide whether to risk publication.         The editors and reporters urged her to publish the papers, but the lawyers suggested waiting, fearing the whole company -- its newspapers, magazines, and radio and television stations -- was at stake. Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Frightened and tense, I took a big gulp and said, 'Go ahead, go ahead, go ahead. Let's go. Let's publish.' ''         At the Supreme Court, the Times and Post cases were heard together, and the justices voted, 6 to 3, on June 30, 1971, against restraining publication of the Pentagon Papers on the ground of endangering national security. That vote is considered a major triumph for freedom of the press.         Mr. Bradlee called the publication of the Pentagon Papers a key moment in the life of the newspaper. ''It was just sort of the graduation of The Post into the highest ranks,'' he said. ''One of our unspoken goals was to get the world to refer to The Post and New York Times in the same breath, which they previously hadn't done. After the Pentagon Papers, they did.''         In a statement yesterday, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, chairman emeritus of The New York Times Company, said:         ''We are deeply saddened by the passing of Katharine Graham, a close friend and honored colleague. She will be remembered as a truly remarkable woman, who had a profound effect on the course of events, both at home and abroad. Throughout the last half of the 20th century, she used her intelligence, her courage and her wit to transform the landscape of American journalism, and everyone who cares about a free and impartial press will greatly miss her. We certainly will.''         Weathering Watergate         On June 17, 1972, five months before Nixon's re-election, five men were caught breaking into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in the Watergate complex. The Post began an intense investigation that eventually connected the break-in to the White House.         In the face of intimidation by the Nixon administration, The Post relentlessly published front-page articles by two little-known reporters, Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein, and complemented them with editorials and Herblock cartoons. It eventually proved that what the Nixon administration characterized as a ''third-rate burglary'' was, instead, a scheme directed from the White House to illegally gather intelligence on the Democratic Party, discredit opponents of the administration and subvert the democratic political process.         The Post was alone on reporting Watergate for so long that Mrs. Graham was constantly asking herself, ''If this is such a hell of a story, then where is everybody else?''         In the course of the paper's investigation, the licenses of two of the company's television stations were challenged. Mrs. Graham was advised never to be alone and was also threatened with unspecified retaliation if The Post published an article that said John Mitchell, when he was attorney general, controlled a secret fund that was used to spy on the Democrats. Mr. Mitchell memorably  warned Mr. Bernstein that ''Katie Graham'' would have a breast ''caught in a big fat wringer if that's published.'' Bob Woodward later presented Mrs. Graham with an old-fashioned wooden laundry wringer, which she kept in her office ever after.         At the beginning of the next year the Watergate burglars pleaded guilty, and one of them, hoping to get a more lenient sentence, wrote to John J. Sirica, a federal district judge, to inform him that perjury had been committed and that higher-ups were behind the break-in. That letter vindicated the time and space The Post had devoted to the scandal. For its Watergate reporting, the newspaper was awarded the 1973 Pulitzer Prize for public service.         Meanwhile, the Senate began investigating the scandal and a special prosecutor was appointed. In April 1973, Nixon accepted some responsibility. But in July, it was disclosed that a taping system in the Oval Office had recorded his every word. The tapes revealed that Nixon had ordered a cover-up. He resigned in August 1974.         Mrs. Graham later wrote: ''Without the tapes, the true story would never have emerged. In fact, I believe that we at The Post were really saved in the end by the tapes and the lucky chance that they weren't destroyed.''         Meeting the Elite         In time, as Mrs. Graham became more comfortable with her ability to exercise power, she took trips to confer with foreign leaders, usually accompanied by one of the reporters and her friend Meg Greenfield, who was editor of the editorial page of The Post and a columnist for Newsweek. Mrs. Graham liked to tell the story of her visit to a village in the Ivory Coast where the chief exclaimed what an honor it was to have with them the 17th most important person in the world, a description that she said he had apparently picked up from a poll that had appeared in U.S. News & World Report.         In Washington she started to entertain the political elite at her home in Georgetown and an invitation from her came to be seen as second only to an invitation to the White House.         President Bush recalled in a statement yesterday how Mrs. Graham had welcomed him and his wife, Laura, to Washington with a dinner at her home, as she had with other presidents. He called her ''a true leader and a true lady, steely yet shy, powerful yet humble, known for her integrity and always gracious and generous to others.''         The ''A'' list of the world attended her parties. By the time of her 70th birthday, she had become so powerful a figure that Art Buchwald said in his toast at her party, ''There is one word that brings us all together here tonight. And that word is 'fear.' ''         With the help of the women's movement, and particularly through discussions with Gloria Steinem, Mrs. Graham said she became more cognizant of the causes of her own insecurities and more aware of the problems of working women. She played a signal role in changing Washington mores when it became widely known that on one evening after dinner, she had refused to join the ladies upstairs while the men discussed world affairs over brandy and cigars. And  more women were added to the staffs of both The Post and Newsweek, partly because Mrs. Graham came to understand it was necessary, partly as a result of lawsuits, and partly because of a new climate throughout the country.         Over the years, she found a little time for a personal life. She was courted by a number of men, among them Adlai E. Stevenson after his failed runs for the presidency. She enjoyed weekends at her homes in Virginia and Martha's Vineyard, often in the company of her grandchildren.         Besides her son Donald, she is survived by her daughter, Elizabeth Weymouth, known as Lally; her sons William and Stephen; a sister, Ruth Epstein of Bronxville, N.Y.; 10 grandchildren; and one great-grandchild.         The funeral is scheduled for 11 a.m. on Monday at the National Cathedral in Washington.         The Business of News         Mrs. Graham's resolve on editorial questions often contrasted with indecisiveness on business matters. In the 1970's, she acknowledged in her book, she hired and dismissed top executives at Newsweek, the newspaper division and the Washington Post Company too frequently.         In the early 1970's, Mrs. Graham and her associates tried to make the Washington Post Company more profitable. Newsweek took the lead among news magazines in increasing subscription and newsstand prices. But holding down costs at The Washington Post led to a bitter confrontation with the mechanical unions.         The clash came in October 1975, when the newspaper's pressmen went on strike after contract talks broke down. As the pressmen, members of Local 6 of the Newspaper and Graphic Communications Union, began their walkout, all 72 of the newspaper's presses were vandalized.         Although the paper failed to publish on the first day, a truncated issue appeared the next day. In the face of threats from the striking workers and occasional physical attacks, the reporters voted to stay on the job. Executives handled the classified advertising department, the mailroom and even the presses when they were repaired. Helicopters landed on the roof of The Post building to ferry copy to presses in Maryland and Virginia. It took nearly a month to repair the presses, but The Post continued to appear.         Mrs. Graham not only went on to win the battle of automation of her newspaper, but also to have the final word on a competitor, the financially troubled Washington Star.  The Post had 75 percent of the city's advertising linage by 1981, and The Star was forced to close. By the end of 1981, The Post's daily circulation had soared to 984,000 from 771,000.         Donald Graham succeeded his mother as publisher in 1979 and chief executive of the company in 1991, a company which by then was valued at nearly $2 billion. Mrs. Graham stepped down as chairwoman of the board in 1993, again to be succeeded by her son, but remained on the board as chairwoman of the executive committee.         Mrs. Graham served on the board of The Associated Press, and was chairwoman and president of the American Newspaper Publishers Association, director of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau Inc. and a trustee of George Washington University, the University of Chicago and the Urban Institute.         Finally, she seemed comfortable with herself. ''Worry, if not gone altogether, no longer haunts you in the middle of the night,'' she wrote. ''And you are free -- or freer -- to turn down the things that bore you and spend time on matters and with people you enjoy.''         And she did, till the end. Just two weeks ago she was surrounded by friends at the annual party her daughter gave for her in Southampton, N.Y., and last week was in Idaho for a conference of media executives where she saw more friends and colleagues. She was on her way to a bridge game when she fell.         Katharine Graham's life ended the way she said she wanted it to: ''The only thing I think any of us want,'' she once said, ''is to last as long as we're any good. And then not.''       
         Fanny Brennan, an American painter of small, meticulously executed surrealist still lifes, who spent her childhood in the legendary circle of artists and writers gathered around Sara and Gerald Murphy in Paris, died on July 22 at a hospital in Manhattan. She was 80.         Ms. Brennan was born in 1921 in Paris, where her parents, Richard and Alice Lee Myers, were well-known figures in the city's expatriate art community. The Murphys were close family friends. Educated in Europe and the United States, she enrolled in art school in Paris in 1938, met Tristan Tzara, had her portrait drawn by Giacometti and taught Picasso how to play Chinese checkers at the Cafe Flore.         When war broke out, she left for New York, where she worked for Harpers Bazaar and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1944, she was hired by the Office of War Information to work in Europe. She married the chief of its graphics and exhibitions division, Francis Brennan, in 1946.         Even as a student, Ms. Brennan worked on an unusually small scale. Most of her paintings were three or four inches in diameter. As a young artist in Manhattan, she found that the bathroom of her apartment was the ideal size for a studio. She stopped painting nearly 20 years after her children were born, but began again in 1970 with playful, ingeniously composed images, which often combined domestic objects -- needles, buttons, books -- with panoramic landscapes.         In 1941, she was included in two shows at the Wakefield Bookshop gallery in Manhattan, run by Betty Parsons. Beginning in 1973, she had three solo exhibitions with Parsons, then several with Coe Kerr Gallery. Her work is represented by Salander-O'Reilly Gallery. In 1990, a book of her work, ''Skyshades,'' appeared with an introduction by Calvin Tomkins.         Ms. Brennan is survived by two sons, Richard Lee Brennan of Manhattan and Christopher Herrick Brennan of Feasterville, Pa., and a sister, Lee M. Wrenn of Orcas Island, Wash.       
         Asoka Roy, a nurse-midwife who used the skills she learned abroad to help establish the field as a profession in the United States, died on June 22 in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 85.         Ms. Roy left India, where she was born, in 1955. She earned her nurse-midwife license in New York in 1967, at a time when American women were beginning to seek midwifery services. In 1968, she became the first director of Beth Israel Medical Center's midwifery program, which was one of the first of its kind.         She delivered more than 5,500 babies. ''Midwife Roy addressed each client as if this mother-to-be was a sacred individual on a nine-month journey to deliver a miracle,'' said Dorothea Lang, a former president of the American College of Nurse-Midwives.         In a 1983 article in The New York Times, Ms. Roy explained her approach this way: ''I consider that the woman delivers the baby, not a midwife or obstetrician.''         The daughter of a high-ranking civil servant, Ms. Roy was born in India on Dec. 10, 1915, one of 11 children. Though she did not have to work to support herself, she decided to become a midwife after learning about deficiencies in maternity care in her country.         Her first midwifery job took her to a New Delhi hospital that registered up to 60 births a day. She became fully trained in the British method of midwifery, eventually earning a master's degree at the All India Institute of Hygiene and Public Health in Calcutta.         She also trained in Europe, earning a midwife's teaching certificate at the Royal College of Midwives in London. Unlike some midwives, she welcomed technology as a valuable complement to the traditional skills she practiced; in Stockholm, for example, she studied a vacuum-extraction delivery method.         In 1959, Ms. Roy immigrated to New York City. After she earned bachelor's and master's degrees from New York University, she worked with Dr. George Blinick to found the midwifery program at Beth Israel. Serving as its director until 1983, Ms. Roy taught midwifery and instructed medical students from Yale University. She also lectured internationally and drafted the curriculum of a course to train foreign midwives for practice in the United States.         Survivors include two sisters, Dipti Sisodia and Salma Zahiruddin, both of Kingston, N.Y.; and two brothers, Rustum, of State College, Pa., and Prodipto, of India.         Because of Ms. Roy's experiences in India, she was ''totally calm'' about things like home births that made others nervous, said Ina May Gaskin, president of the Midwives Alliance of North America.         Ms. Roy explained in a 1996 interview in Midwifery Today magazine how she could remain so unperturbed. ''In America you have the best backup for your births,'' she was quoted as saying. ''I was scared when I was two or three days away from a hospital by cart.''       
         Caroline R. Jones, who broke race and sex barriers in advertising to become one of the most prominent black women among agency executives, died on June 28 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 59 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, friends said.         The résumé of Ms. Jones, a copywriter, was dotted with firsts, because in many instances her promotion at an agency made her the first black woman to hold a post. She worked for large Madison Avenue shops and founded or helped found several agencies that specialized in advertising aimed at blacks and other minorities. Over the years, her clients included American Express, Anheuser-Busch, McDonald's, Prudential, Toys ''R'' Us and the Postal Service. In many cases, the clients were making their initial forays into marketing to black consumers through her and her agencies.         She was born Caroline Robinson, in Benton Harbor, Mich., the third of 10 children and the eldest daughter. She graduated from the University of Michigan with a bachelor's degree in English and science. She began her advertising career in 1963 in New York as a secretary and copywriter trainee at J. Walter Thompson. She rose to creative director. In 1968, she helped form Zebra Associates, unusual for that era because it was a full-service agency with black principals. In the 1970's and 80's, she alternated between general market agencies like Kenyon & Eckhardt (now part of the Bozell Group) and Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn (now BBDO) and black-owned agencies. She helped found the Black Creative Group and Mingo, Jones, Guilmenot, later Mingo-Jones Advertising and now the Chisholm-Mingo Group.         At Mingo-Jones, Ms. Jones was executive vice president and creative director, working on campaigns like ''We do chicken right'' for Kentucky Fried Chicken, which the company used not just for black consumers but for the general market. She left in 1986 to open her own agency, Creative Resources Management, and later operated shops under the names Caroline Jones Advertising and Caroline Jones Inc., where she was president at the time of her death.         Ms. Jones had also been a member of the New York State Banking Board and the advisory committee of the Women's Bank of New York. For many years, she was a moderator and host of radio and television programs under the titles ''Focus on the Black Woman'' and ''In the Black: Keys to Success.''         Ms. Jones is survived by a son, Anthony R. Jones of Manhattan, and seven siblings: Betty Bowman, Brenda Taylor and Renee Williams of Benton Harbor; David Robinson of Indianapolis; Dinah Robinson of Los Angeles; Kimberly Robinson of New York; and Patricia Robinson of Chicago.       
         Kim Stanley, whose infrequent but luminous stage portraits brought her to the edge of greatness, but who ultimately shrank from the pressures of performance and stardom, died yesterday at a hospital in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 76 and lived in Santa Fe.         She died after a prolonged illness, said her daughter Rachel Ryder Zahn.         In plays like William Inge's ''Picnic,'' Horton Foote's ''Traveling Lady'' and, especially, Inge's ''Bus Stop,'' Ms. Stanley captivated Broadway audiences and dazzled the critics in roles that ranged from a gauche young tomboy to a gallant abandoned wife to a well-traveled wisecracking nightclub singer.         She seemed able to take on almost any part and make it come convincingly alive. In the 1955 ''Bus Stop,'' she played Cherie, a worn-at-the-edges nightclub singer -- she calls herself a chanteuse -- who finds herself sitting out a snowstorm in a Kansas diner with her fellow bus passengers, one of whom is a swaggering cowboy. Their sparring not only won laughs, but also touched the heart.         Ms. Stanley, who later admitted to being tone deaf, even managed a deftly comic rendition of ''That Old Black Magic.'' Brooks Atkinson, in The New York Times, summed up her work as superb and called it a ''glowing performance that is full of amusing detail -- cheap, ignorant, bewildered, but also radiant with personality.''         Ms. Stanley had already won accolades two years earlier as the hoydenish teenager Millie Owens in ''Picnic.'' Then, cast as Georgette Thomas, a young mother whose husband has deserted her in Mr. Foote's 1954 drama ''The Traveling Lady,'' Ms. Stanley so dominated the stage that she was given star billing two days after the play's premiere.         There were more good reviews for her stage work in the years that followed. She appeared in ''A Clearing in the Woods,'' ''A Touch of the Poet,'' ''Cheri,'' ''A Far Country'' and ''The Three Sisters,'' among other plays, but nothing came close to her success in ''Bus Stop'' except her performance in the 1958 film ''The Goddess,'' one of her rare forays into Hollywood.         In that film Ms. Stanley won praise as a glamorous actress whose life is emotionally barren, managing to project glamour even though she was quick to concede she was no celluloid siren. She soon decided she did not much like acting for the cameras. The fragmented nature of movie making frustrated her. It was, she said, like ''shooting pool in the dark.''         Kim Stanley, whose original name was Patricia Reid, was born on Feb. 11, 1925, in Tularosa, N.M. Her parents were divorced when she was a young girl, and she and her three brothers were raised by her mother, an interior decorator who moved the family from New Mexico to Texas. Often lonely as a child, she wrote poetry and dreamed of becoming an artist or, at the very least, the local May Queen. She acted in school plays, attended the University of New Mexico and eventually graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of Texas.         Her acting experiences in school had kindled a spark, she later said, but she was still thinking of pursuing a graduate degree and perhaps a career in medicine. Then she was approached by a director of the Pasadena Playhouse, who by chance had seen her perform in a college production and offered her a scholarship. She stayed at the California theater only a year, but it was enough to change the course of her life. The compass pointed toward Broadway.         After a season of walk-ons with a stock company in Louisville, Ky., where she'd gone at the urging of a friend who was working there, she boarded a Greyhound bus for New York. After a few fruitless months of making the rounds, talking to agents and trying to see producers, she turned to modeling dresses and then worked as a waitress at a hotel. She also went through a brief marriage to another aspiring actor, Bruce Hall.         The Off Broadway theater was in its infancy, but Ms. Stanley (she had taken her maternal grandmother's maiden name some years before) took an unpaid job with a Greenwich Village group called the Interplayers and lived off the money she had earned as a model. She met other promising newcomers, among them Gene Saks, Sidney Lumet and Michael V. Gazzo (later to write ''A Hatful of Rain'') and soon found herself in a new group called Off Broadway Inc.         She joined the Actors Studio, where she met and worked with the Studio's guru, Lee Strasberg, and later described him as the person ''who made it possible for the whole world to open up for me.'' Method acting, she said, was the key to becoming ''as free as possible.''         In 1949 she put her training to work at the Cherry Lane Theater in Greenwich Village, acting opposite Anthony Franciosa in Gertrude Stein's ''Yes Is for a Very Young Man,'' a production that drew good reviews and calls from theatrical agents. More good notices followed her next appearance, as St. Joan at the Equity Library Theater, and when the producer Kermit Bloomgarden called to invite her to replace Julie Harris in Lillian Hellman's ''Montserrat,'' she made the leap to Broadway.         Ms. Stanley married for the second time in 1949, to another actor, Curt Conway, with whom she had a son, Jamison, and a daughter, Lisa, and soon found herself torn between the conflicting demands of family and career. Performance pressures also began to take their toll, and even after her shining success in ''Bus Stop,'' stories began to circulate about her profound malaise each night at curtain time. By 1957 she had been though another divorce and remarriage, this time to the actor and director Alfred Ryder, by whom she had another daughter, Rachel. Her children survive her, along with a brother, Justin, and three grandchildren.         By the end of the 50's there were other signs of trouble. In 1958 she appeared with Helen Hayes and the British actor Eric Portman in ''A Touch of the Poet'' by Eugene O'Neill. Atkinson hailed Ms. Stanley and Ms. Hayes as ''the two finest actresses of their respective generations.'' Nevertheless, after opening night Ms. Stanley missed a number of performances. It was no secret by then that she and Portman were not on speaking terms, and it was no great surprise when Ms. Stanley abruptly left the play, blaming Portman for slapping her in one scene with what she said was excessive enthusiasm. Portman in turn declared, ''I don't go bashing people in the face,'' but Ms. Stanley was gone for good.         Such conflicts aside, she was still working at perfecting her art. ''To keep it fresh, I try to begin all over again in each performance,'' she told an interviewer. In 1959 she played a middle-aged woman in love with a handsome 19-year-old (Horst Buchholz) in ''Cherie,'' adapted by Anita Loos from two novels by Colette and set in France in the years just before and after World War I. Atkinson found her performance ''magnetic and illuminating.'' Two years later, in Henry Denker's semi-documentary 1961 play ''A Far Country,'' directed by her husband, Alfred Ryder, Ms. Stanley won praise as a young woman afflicted by hysterical paralysis who is helped by the pioneering work of Sigmund Freud.         In 1964 Ms. Stanley returned to the source of her first inspiration as an actress and appeared as Masha in an  Actors Studio Theater production of Chekhov's ''Three Sisters,'' directed by her old mentor, Lee Strasberg, and co-starring Geraldine Page and Shirley Knight. It was to be Ms. Stanley's last appearance on the New York stage.         The same year, in the British film thriller ''Seance on a Wet Afternoon,'' her portrayal of a sinister London medium who, with her compliant husband (Richard Attenborough), schemes to kidnap a child, won her rave reviews and an Oscar nomination as best actress. Writing in The Times, Bosley Crowther described Ms. Stanley's portrait of the woman as ''a humble, cloying shrew -- an insidiously diabolic creature, and yet a pitiful victim.'' She did not win an Oscar, although the New York Film Critics gave her their best actress award. Moviegoers were not to see her again for 18 years.         In little more than a decade she had established herself as one of Broadway's most brilliant actresses although, oddly, she never won a Tony Award. She had a number of television appearances to her credit, appearing in various dramatic series and winning an Emmy in 1963 for her work in a ''Ben Casey'' episode about mercy killing. But there were only the two Hollywood films, ''The Goddess'' and ''Seance.'' And for a long while that was the sum of her career: brilliant but all too brief. She returned to her native New Mexico, put aside the stresses of performing, did some teaching in Santa Fe and nursed her ambition to have her own ensemble of actors.         By 1979, however, she was back in New York as artistic director of a troupe of actors in a small theater in SoHo. ''I want to be involved with the great plays,'' she told an interviewer, and admitted that she missed acting and intended to act again. For one thing, she said, ''before I get too old, I'd like to do Hedda Gabler,'' and, she added, she wanted to make ''a serious film about Virginia Woolf.''         As it turned out, she did neither, but she did return to films in 1982 in ''Frances,'' in which she played the ambitious, devouring mother of the actress Frances Farmer (Jessica Lange). Her performance brought her a second Oscar nomination, this time for best supporting actress. The next year, she had a small part as a barnstorming pilot in ''The Right Stuff.'' And she returned to television in 1984, winning her second Emmy in the role of Big Mama in a PBS production of Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof,'' with Ms. Lange and Tommy Lee Jones.         There the story ended. Ms. Stanley spent her last years quietly, back in New Mexico. ''You can't be good in the theater unless you've immersed yourself in the marvelous detective story of the human spirit,'' she once told an interviewer. ''But it's difficult, terribly difficult.''         In her case the mystery remained unsolved. She had, in effect, achieved her childhood dream of becoming the May Queen, but chose to leave the parade before its end.         Correction:  August 27, 2001, Monday  An obituary of the actress Kim Stanley on Tuesday misstated the surname of her son and misidentified his father. The son changed his name to Jamison Clift from Conway in the 1980's. His father was William Brooks Clift Jr., not Ms. Stanley's second husband, Curt Conway.         The obituary also omitted a film credit for Ms. Stanley. The Actors Studio production of ''The Three Sisters'' in which she played Masha was videotaped in 1965 and transferred to film and released in 1977.       
         THERE is no saying no to Caroline H. Newhouse. But you wouldn't know it upon meeting the matriarch of the Newhouse  family in the formal sitting room of her Park Avenue apartment. She sits on a plush sofa, a well-coiffed little woman of 91, ever so sweet, so demure.         But don't let her fool you. This is one tough lady.         Just ask the many wealthy relatives whom she has ordered to fan out into the philanthropic world, assigning them to various boards and charities, even making her pitch at the family Thanksgiving dinner. (She waits until cocktails are over.)         Mrs. Newhouse is an aunt of  S. I. Newhouse Jr., the multibillionaire chairman of Condé Nast Publications. She is the widow of Theodore Newhouse, one of three brothers who founded one of the nation's biggest communications conglomerates. She has become the grande dame of charities in her family.         There was that time when Mrs. Newhouse, as an original board member of the New York City Opera, informed sorrowful board members that she planned on retiring, but she told them, rather drily, not to worry. She'd find them another Newhouse. She called up her nephew Mark Newhouse, who later became the opera board's president.         ''She didn't really offer it,'' the nephew says.  ''She pretty much told me.''         Mrs. Newhouse also put the bite on her niece  Caroline Diamond Harrison, noting pointedly that Mrs. Harrison's sister Alison Diamond Levasseur is on the junior committee of the New York City Opera, and that she too should have something to do. Mrs. Newhouse nabbed her niece for her pet charity, Career Transition for Dancers, a nonprofit group that finds new skills for retiring dancers.         ''There's no denying it,'' Mrs. Harrison says. ''She always comes out with things going the way she wants them to go.''         But in Mrs. Newhouse's apartment, her steely determination is not immediately apparent. She is a bit nervous, extending her hand in a sitting room surrounded by bronze sculptures of her own creation and artwork that includes a Renoir here, a little Rubens over there. Dressed in a salmon-colored pantsuit, she makes small talk about the weather, her failing eyesight. Her fingers drip with serious diamonds, and large South Sea pearls are draped around her neck. A uniformed servant materializes to offer refreshments.         MRS. NEWHOUSE is not keen to draw attention to herself or her philanthropic efforts. ''I don't like to talk about myself,'' she mutters. But her red-painted lips curl into a sly smile and she chuckles, confirming how she has indeed parceled out charity assignments to family members. ''Oh yes, they always say yes,'' she boasts. ''They all make time when I ask them to do something.''         As she rises to give a tour of her artwork, Mrs. Newhouse moves with fragile steps through the foyer with the marble checkerboard floor and into her small library. She pats the seat beside her on a sofa, coaxing up her gray Persian cat, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, with luminescent orange eyes. ''Come, sweetheart, don't be bashful. Come here, Wolfie.''         She speaks with an accent still strong from her native Germany, which she left at 23. She has an Old World modesty, too. It takes her closest friend, Alexander J. Dubé, to loosen her up. Mr. Dubé, the executive director of Career Transition for Dancers, bounds into the room, jiggling coins that he found on the floor. They glance at each other conspiratorially. More money for the organization.         ''Go find some more,'' she says, holding open her palm.         Mrs. Newhouse has been particularly adroit at roping family members into involvement with Career Transition for Dancers, which has served more than 2,000 dancers since it began in 1985.         ''She makes them work,'' says  Mr. Dubé, 62, who met Mrs. Newhouse and her husband 26 years ago. ''She'll call them up and say, 'Why haven't you sold any tables for the gala?' or call them up and say, 'I want you to be my co-chair.' She goes after them, and no one says no to Aunt Caroline.''         Si Newhouse Jr.'s Condé Nast is a major underwriter of the organization's annual fund-raising gala in October. Another nephew, Jonathan Newhouse, and his wife, Ronnie Cooke Newhouse, have flown in from London, where they live, to be chairman and chairwoman of the benefits.         Mrs. Newhouse has donated $1 million to establish a permanent home and created a scholarship fund that has given away more than $1 million. She never studied dance herself, but often used dancers as models. She says they taught her much about their short careers, facing retirement on average around 30, or when they are injured. ''They're lost, because when you are a dancer you have no time to do anything else but dance,'' she says.         Mrs. Newhouse retired from sculpturing in her mid-70's. She began studying the arts in Germany. She was one of three children raised by her mother after her father, a military officer, was killed in World War I. She says she inherited her spirit of giving from her mother.         She met her future husband at a New Hampshire resort. When he told her he sold newspapers, she thought he owned a kiosk or hawked newspapers as a street vendor. They married a  year later, in 1956.         Mrs. Newhouse thinks she and the Newhouse family are a good match. ''They are so warm and giving, and they respect me because I am the oldest. I am the matriarch.''         Still, she won't let them off the hook when it comes to her charities.         ''They have never said no to me yet.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Maureen Reagan, the outspoken daughter of former President Ronald Reagan who was often at odds with her father's policies, died yesterday at her home in Sacramento. She was 60, and had suffered a recurrence of melanoma, a skin cancer with which she was first diagnosed in 1996 and that, after some years in remission, recurred last fall.         Ms. Reagan was a politically active feminist who worked to support the proposed equal rights amendment, lobbied for abortion rights and helped elect women to public office.  She had a distant relationship with her father for decades after he and  her mother, the actress Jane Wyman, divorced in 1948.         Although Ms. Reagan volunteered her services in 1966 when her father  ran for governor of California, his consultants rejected her offer on the ground that her participation would again bring Mr. Reagan's divorce to the attention of the public. She recalled a news release at the time that said Mr. Reagan and his wife Nancy, whom he married in 1952, had had two children, Patti and Ronnie, and did not mention her or her brother Michael.         A thaw between father and daughter began when Mr. Reagan ran for president in 1980.         ''When he was elected president, she had more communication and involvement with her father than she had had for the rest of her life,'' her friend Judy Carter, the daughter-in-law of former President Jimmy Carter, said in 1989.         Ms. Reagan, too, tried her hand at politics. She was twice defeated in Republican primary races in California, for the United States Senate in 1982 and for a Southern California Congressional seat in 1992. Her first campaign was undermined by reports that her father, then president, did not want her involved in the race, but a decade later he endorsed her Congressional run.         To accusations that she was trading on the Reagan name, she said, ''I don't run because of my name but I don't run from it.'' She noted that people who accused her of exploiting family ties ''forget I was a Republican before the president was.''         ''I licked my first envelope in 1960,'' Ms. Reagan said, ''and I've never stopped working.''         She said that as an 11-year-old watching television coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, she preferred the Republicans ''because they were better organized.''         At an even younger age, she exhibited the traits for which she was known throughout her life: strong will and impatience. As one of her critics once said, she was ''simply not schooled in the ways of holding her tongue.''         In 1987, after the Iran-contra affair, when Ms. Reagan asserted that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's national security aides,  should be court-martialed for their actions, Mr. Reagan told Republican leaders, ''I gave up arguing with my daughter long ago.''         Maureen Elizabeth Reagan was born on Jan. 4, 1941, and in her early school years attended the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., as a boarder. She went to Emerson Junior High School in Los Angeles and to high school at Immaculate Heart in Hollywood. After a year at Marymount College of Virginia in Arlington she dropped out because, she said, ''I wanted to do something, be somewhere, I wanted to be an actress, and to be one, you had to know something of the world.''         When she left school, her father  told her, ''Well, write if you get work.''         The work she got was as a secretary in Washington, where she also took part in local theater. She soon returned to the West, to Las Vegas and California, where she sang in nightclubs, did a few commercials (Duncan Hines and Crisco) and had bit parts in television shows (''The Partridge Family'' and ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'') and in the 1964 Elvis Presley movie ''Kissin' Cousins.'' In her 1989 book, ''First Father, First Daughter,'' (Little, Brown & Company), Ms. Reagan recalled, ''I went out on so many auditions I began to think of changing my middle name to Rejection.''         Her brief television and movie career was followed by a stint as a talk show host on KABC Radio in Los Angeles, and in 1969 she joined a U.S.O. tour of Vietnam.         By 1980, Ms. Reagan was director of an organization called Sell Overseas America, which promoted American products abroad, a position she resigned two years later to pursue her Senate campaign.         Ms. Reagan's book revealed that she had been the victim of domestic  violence in her first marriage, in 1960, to John Filippone, a Washington policeman. The marriage lasted barely a year. A 1964 marriage to David Sills, a Marine lieutenant, ended in divorce in 1968.         Her husband of 20 years, Dennis Revell, a public relations executive in Sacramento, survives her as does a daughter, Rita, whom the couple adopted from Uganda in 1994. In addition to her father, stepmother and siblings, she is also survived by her mother.         Although she was an ardent Republican, Ms. Reagan angered many members of the party by her refusal to compromise and for stepping on toes. In 1983, she was given the title of special consultant to the Republican National Committee and moved to the family quarters in the White House.         When asked if she had been happy with her father's record on women's issues , she said: ''No, I haven't. I think there could be a much better record and I would certainly place the blame, I think, where it belongs. That's in the hands of certain people on the senior staff, who have never really accepted that there is a political power of women and that has to be addressed.''         Larry Speakes, a White House spokesman in the Reagan administration, noted in his book ''Speaking Out,'' that the president's aides, including Secretary of State George P. Shultz, were afraid of Ms. Reagan, known to many as Big Mo.         ''You would avoid her if possible and agree with her if you had to deal with her,'' Mr. Speakes wrote.         Ms. Reagan's most active political years were in the 1980's, when she was a member of the California World Trade Commission, chairwoman of the United States delegation to the United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Kenya, in 1985; co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and chairwoman of the Republican Women's Political Action League.         As Ms. Reagan became more influential, she worked to increase Republican fund-raising for women running for office.         Ms. Reagan said she first recognized the symptoms of Alzheimer's in her father in 1994 when he was unable to recall the part he had played in a movie. ''Actors always remember the roles they played,'' she said. She joined the Alzheimer's Association board and began traveling the country to raise research money.         Her personal and political creed was perhaps best summed up in a 1982 interview. ''People who hurt my friends I have a lot of trouble forgiving,'' she said. ''People who hurt me I tend to forgive but I never forget.''       
         Nora Sayre, a film critic and essayist best known for her commentary on the cultural effects of the cold war -- died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was emphysema, said Mary Sayre Haverstock, her cousin.         As the child of parents who knew both the New York and Hollywood writing scenes, Ms. Sayre witnessed firsthand the struggles of writers in the crosswinds of America's anti-Communist fervor, which she later insisted both preceded and continued long after the era of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's red-hunting in the early 1950's. In ''Running Time: Films of the Cold War'' (1982, Dial Press), her second book, she analyzed the effect of this fervor on Hollywood movie-making in the 1950's.         In her next book, ''Previous Convictions: A Journey Through the 1950's'' (1995, Rutgers University Press), she dug deeper into the period. ''The readiness to challenge and then contradict official wisdom was supposed to be an American tradition,'' she wrote, ''but that kind of autonomy was rare in the 1950's, and I was fortunate to come of age among people who took their independence for granted.''         Reviewing ''Previous Convictions,'' David Caute, a historian of anti-Communism, described Ms. Sayre as ''an essayist whose light touch masks the formidable weight of her judgments'' and whose ''natural province is not so much history as people's consciousness.'' He continued, ''Her fault is sometimes to seek out complications which may not be there -- as in her accounts of former Communists who still feel they were right to be wrong -- but this flaw is no doubt reinforced by her affection for individuals she meets and her refusal to accept any aspect of American cold war ideology.''         Nora Clemens Sayre was born on Sept. 20, 1932, in Hamilton, Bermuda, the only child of Joel Sayre, a staff writer and war correspondent for The New Yorker and occasional Hollywood screenwriter -- he wrote ''Annie Oakley'' (1935) for Barbara Stanwyck and was a co-writer on ''Gunga Din'' (1939) -- and Gertrude (Lynahan) Sayre, a reporter for The New York World. Ms. Sayre attended the Putney School, in Vermont, graduating in 1950, and Radcliffe College, where, as she later described herself, she was apolitical and hung out with the aesthetes and actors who founded the Poets' Theater in Cambridge, and where she graduated cum laude in 1954.         ''Like a lot of my generation, I grew up with no politics at all,'' she told Brian Close, a student at the Columbia Journalism School, in a recent interview. ''I didn't even read the newspaper. Mine was a rather liberated family. But it was a very square time. Even the freest spirts were cautious. Clearly life was safer and easier if you had no politics.''         In 1955, the year after her graduation from Radcliffe, she took off for Europe with an eye to ''blotting out,'' she later reported, her parents' unhappy marriage and her mother's suicidal depressions. In London, wafted by her parents' literary connections, she met the likes of Arthur Koestler, his lover the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard (future wife of Kingsley Amis), James Thurber, A. J. Liebling, Walker Evans, Cyril Connolly, Henry Green, Graham Greene and Charlie and Oona Chaplin. She also met members of the American community in exile -- targets of Hollywood blacklisting and the United States' anti-communist campaign -- which was centered around Frognal, the house of Donald Ogden Stewart and Ella Winter, his Australian-born wife.         It was in England that she became more politically aware -- ''they may have more of a vigorous opposition than we do,'' she told Mr. Close -- and realized she was ''somewhat of a lefty.'' As she reports in her recently published memoir of that time, ''On the Wing: A Young American Abroad'' (2001, Counterpoint), she was often considered fair game by sexually avaricious older writers.         Under the tutelage of the literary critic John Davenport, she began to write for publication. As she recalled in ''On the Wing,'' ''He would arrive for an unscheduled lunch in my Bourne Street basement, bringing bacon and frozen string beans and books and imperatives: 'Why don't you eat this, read this, write about that.' Soon these editorial sessions were part of my London week: he read my pieces before I submitted them -- plucking out passages that needed polishing but never suggesting any words of his own'' and ''instilling a horror of clichés.''         She landed a job writing book reviews for The New Statesman. ''I don't want to give too much credit to the Brits because I am no Anglophile,'' she told Mr. Close, ''but they give a writer so much more freedom, especially then.'' Ms. Sayre eventually returned to the United States in the early 1960's. She had been through a brief, unsuccessful marriage to Robert Neild, a former Royal Air Force pilot, a lecturer in economics at Cambridge and a rising figure in the Labor Party.         Ms. Sayre served as New York correspondent for the New Statesman from 1965 until 1970. Her first book, a collection of pieces titled ''Sixties Going on Seventies'' (Rutgers University Press) -- which covered everything from student strikes and yippies to the 1972 Democratic and Republican Conventions  -- led to her employment at The New York Times in 1973 when her book was recommended to Arthur Gelb, then managing editor of the paper, as deserving of a review. Mr. Gelb was inspired by it to appoint her movie reviewer for The Times.         She left The Times in 1975 and for the next seven years worked as a freelancer, writing for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation, The Progressive and Esquire, among other publications, and winning a Guggenheim fellowship, 1975-76, and a National Endowment for the Arts grant, 1978. ''I managed for those seven years to break even with no other income at all,'' she told Mr. Close. ''I was able to travel. I was able to go to the dentist.'' She added: ''Freelancer has become a very offensive term. Ten years ago it was legitimate. Maybe. Now it's just another word for 'unemployed.' ''         In 1981 she became a visiting lecturer in Columbia University's writing program. Over the course of her career she also served as a lecturer and instructor in various writing workshops, including as a participant in the visiting authors program of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, the lecture series at the Museum of Modern Art, and at the Museum of Television and Radio. She was writer in residence for a semester at James Thurber House in Columbus, Ohio, and a frequent resident at Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.         She is survived by her cousin, of Oberlin, Ohio.         Ms. Sayre was proud of having covered every presidential political convention from the time she returned to this country, and she continued to work eight hours a day up until the time she entered the hospital. Living in a New York City apartment bought for her by friends, partly to help her out and partly as an investment, she wrote drafts on yellow legal pads -- ''like Richard Nixon,'' she told Mr. Close. ''It isn't all writing,'' she explained. ''Some of it is rewriting or looking at things with a critical eye. It is very easy to fill eight hours this way.''         She described herself to Mr. Close as ''of a certain age.'' She added: ''It isn't vanity, dear, but unfortunately writers are downgraded in our earnings, based on our age. They think we become less capable of grasping things.''       
         Ida Russ Schwartz, one of three sisters who with their father, Joel Russ, sliced smoked salmon, pickled herrings and weighed out caviar at Russ & Daughters, their renowned appetizer store on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, died on Aug. 24 in Pembroke Pines, Fla. She was 86.         With her older sister, Hattie Gold, and her younger sister, Anne Federman, Mrs. Schwartz grew up working in the business begun as a pushcart in 1914 by their father.         Eventually moving into a shop at the present location at 179 East Houston Street, the Russ family developed an enviable reputation for the finest smoked fish, cheeses, olives, salads, dried mushrooms and sweets, the nonmeat delicacies known as appetizers among Eastern European Jews.         Ida Russ was born in New York.  Mrs. Federman said that their father, an immigrant from Russia, was a demanding taskmaster, and the entire family worked in the store, often after school and always on the busiest holidays and crowded Sundays.         As a reward, about 50 years ago, Mrs. Federman recalls, they had a big celebration, and Mr. Russ, who had no sons, announced that his daughters would be partners, a progressive decision in those days.         Mrs. Schwartz met her first husband, Max Pulvers, through work, and he, like the husbands of the other sisters, joined the business. They were divorced before his death.         The feistiest of the sisters, Mrs. Schwartz was often at odds with her father as to how the business should be run, and finally left to open her own successful store, popularly known as Ida's, in Massapequa, N.Y. There she prepared many of the salads herself. Tiring of the long hours, Mrs. Schwartz became an antiques dealer and proved to have as sharp an eye for porcelain and glass as she did for smoked whitefish.         A few years ago, she retired to Florida, as did her sisters, who survive her.         Mrs. Schwartz is also survived by a daughter, Lorraine Commanday of Charlottesville, Va., and a son, Martin Russ Pulvers of Mountainview, Calif. Her second husband, Louis Schwartz, died before her.         The family tradition continues at Russ & Daughters, with Mrs. Federman's son Mark, his wife, Maria, and their daughter, Niki, owning and operating the store.       
         Pauline Kael, who expressed her passion for movies in jaunty, jazzy prose as the longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died yesterday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 82.         Ms. Kael was probably the most influential film critic of her time. She reviewed movies for The New Yorker from 1968 to 1979, and again, after working briefly in the film industry, from 1980 until 1991. Earlier, she was a film critic for Life magazine in 1965, for McCall's in 1965 and 1966 and for The New Republic in 1966 and 1967.         Enchanting her fans and infuriating her foes, rarely dull and often sharp and funny, with an intellectualism that reflected her background as a student of philosophy, Ms. Kael was never anything but outspoken.         Whether dismissing auteur theory, reviewing Robert Altman's ''Nashville'' (1975) before it was finished, questioning the extent of Orson Welles's contribution to ''Citizen Kane'' (1941) or proclaiming Bernardo Bertolucci's ''Last Tango in Paris'' (1973) as a cultural event comparable to the 1913 premiere of Stravinsky's ''Sacre du Printemps,'' Ms. Kael was always provocative. Her seductive writing style bred a legion of acolytes, known as Paulettes.         The critic Louis Menand wrote in The New York Review of Books in March 1995: ''Kael was the most brilliantly ad hoc critic of her time, and she made it possible to care about movies without feeling pompous or giddy by showing that what comes first in everyone's experience of a movie isn't the form or the idea but the sensation, and that this is just as true for moviegoers who have been taught to intellectualize their responses to art as it is for everyone else.''         By the time she retired, Mr. Menand observed, she had produced a generation of inferior imitators. ''The manner of appreciation she invented has become the standard manner of popular culture criticism in America,'' he wrote.         Assessing her impact in a 1998 interview, Ms. Kael said: ''I think my influence was largely in style, not substance. Other critics sound like me because my writing has influenced them. They've rarely agreed with me about movies.''         At the same time, she deflected the question of whether her criticism had had any effect on films and filmmakers. ''I'd rather not say,'' she answered. ''If I say yes, I'm an egotist, and if I say no, I've wasted my life. Although I've been told I have influenced some people to become directors. Unfortunately, most of them are lousy.''         Overpraising or overdamning was Ms. Kael's way, and she left no doubt about her favorites: actors like Marlon Brando, Nicolas Cage, Sean Connery, Robert Duvall, Morgan Freeman, Tom Hanks, Tommy Lee Jones, Paul Newman, Nick Nolte, Al Pacino, John Travolta, Denzel Washington and Bruce Willis, and actresses like Joan Cusack, Diane Keaton, Anjelica Huston, Jessica Lange, Michelle Pfeiffer, Sigourney Weaver and Debra Winger.         She championed films of the 1970's, like Francis Ford Coppola's ''Godfather'' (1972) and ''Godfather, Part II'' (1974); Martin Scorsese's ''Mean Streets'' (1973) and ''Taxi Driver'' (1976); Hal Ashby's ''Shampoo'' (1975); and Mr. Altman's ''McCabe and Mrs. Miller'' (1971) and ''M*A*S*H'' (1970). She also liked the sensual violence of directors like Sam Peckinpah, whose films included ''The Wild Bunch'' (1969) and ''Straw Dogs'' (1971), and Brian De Palma, whose works include ''Carrie'' (1976) and ''Casualties of War'' (1989).         ''You know, they talk about the golden age of the cinema as if it took place in the late 30's or in the 40's,'' she said in 1989. ''There was nothing personal and exciting in most of those movies. They were machine tooled. They were a lot of fun. But except for Preston Sturges and a few flukey individualists, they just didn't have the personal voice of the movies of the 70's.''         As a writer whose heyday spanned the years from ''Bonnie and Clyde'' (1967) to ''Awakenings'' (1990), ''Sleeping With the Enemy'' (1991) and ''L.A. Story'' (1991), Ms. Kael could mingle references to literary lions like Saul Bellow, Jean Genet and Norman Mailer with demotic condemnations like loony, sleazo, junk and bummer.         In a 1968 review in The New York Times of ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang,'' a collection of Ms. Kael's reviews and articles, Eliot Fremont-Smith called her ''the most quotable critic writing; but what is important and bracing is that she relates movies to other experiences, to ideas and attitudes, to ambition, books, money, other movies, to politics and the evolving culture, to moods of the audience, to our sense of ourselves -- to what movies do to us, the acute and self-scrutinizing awareness of which is always at the core of her judgment.''         Reviewing ''The Sound of Music'' (1965) in treacle-curdling prose that reportedly prompted McCall's to dismiss her, Ms. Kael asked, ''Wasn't there perhaps one little Von Trapp who didn't want to sing his head off or who screamed that he wouldn't act out little glockenspiel routines for Papa's party guests, or who got nervous and threw up if he had to get out on a stage?''         Writing about Kevin Costner in ''Dances With Wolves'' (1990), she said he had ''feathers in his hair and feathers in his head.'' Writing about Robert De Niro in ''Awakenings,'' she said, ''It's in the quiet moments that he's particularly bad.'' She also said that that film contained ''another of Robin Williams's benevolent-eunuch roles.''         At her peak, she lauded popular movies like Steven Spielberg's ''Jaws'' (1975) and Philip Kaufman's ''Invasion of the Body Snatchers'' (1978) and became more of a supporter of the auteur theory. But in time, Ms. Kael, who attracted notice early in her career by attacking critics like Bosley Crowther of The Times and Andrew Sarris of The Village Voice, came under fire for predictability and dogmatism.         It was inevitable that she should be the object of criticism herself. George Lucas named the villainous General Kael in ''Willow'' (1988) for her, and in a celebrated onslaught in The New York Review of Books in 1980, the writer Renata Adler declared Ms. Kael's work ''piece by piece, line by line, without interruption, worthless.''         Ms. Adler, a former film critic for The Times, wrote that Ms. Kael's recent work ''falls somewhere between huckster copy and ideological pamphleteering,'' and that ''mistaking lack of civility for vitality, she substitutes for argument a protracted, obsessional invective.''         Assessing her own work, Ms. Kael said: ''I try not to be rough on small films. Generally, when I'm really rough, it's on something that I know is going to be a big hit, and that everybody is going to go for it, and I think it's an atrocity -- that's fair game. I'm interested in discovering talent, and in trying to explain why I think someone is talented. I'm more interested in that than I am in panning.''         Over the years, Ms. Kael's reviews and essays were assembled in a series of books whose double-entendre titles suggested the intimacy of her love affair with movies (she preferred the word ''movies'' to ''film'' or ''cinema''). Among them were ''I Lost It at the Movies'' (1965); ''Kiss Kiss Bang Bang'' (1968); ''Going Steady'' (1970); ''Deeper Into Movies'' (1973), a 1974 National Book Award winner; ''Reeling'' (1976); ''When the Lights Go Down'' (1980); ''Hooked'' (1989); ''Movie Love'' (1991); and ''For Keeps'' (1994).         When the last was published, she said in the introduction: ''I'm frequently asked why I don't write my memoirs. I think I have.''         Central to her approach to criticism was her belief that the popular appeal of movies was rooted in trash. In her essay ''Trash, Art and the Movies,'' reprinted in ''Going Steady,'' Ms. Kael wrote: ''Movies took their impetus not from the desiccated, imitation European high culture, but from the peep show, the Wild West show, the music hall, the comic strip -- from what was coarse and common.''         She went on to say: ''If we've grown up at the movies, we know that good work is not continuous with the academic, respectable tradition but with glimpses of something good in trash, but we want the subversive gesture carried to the domain of discovery. Trash has given us an appetite for art.''         Ms. Kael's appetite for the movies began in childhood. The fifth child and third daughter of immigrants from Poland, Isaac Paul Kael and the former Judith Friedman, she was born in Petaluma, Calif., on June 19, 1919. She described her father as a gentleman farmer and a moviegoer, and her own trips to see films began early.         Among the favorites she recalled were comedies in the late 1920's that starred Bebe Daniels as a wisecracking flapper; ''Million Dollar Legs'' (1932), with W. C. Fields; and the Marx Brothers's ''Monkey Business'' (1931) and ''Duck Soup'' (1933).         For a time the Kaels lived on their Sonoma County farm, which they lost in the Depression. Ms. Kael was 8 when her family moved to San Francisco.         ''A bookish girl from a bookish family'' is the way she once described herself. Blue-eyed, brown-haired, five feet tall and weighing a bit more than 100 pounds, she said: ''I had trouble dating because I often disagreed about the quality of a movie. One boy was so upset at my laughing at 'Kentucky Moonshine,' a Ritz Brothers movie, that we never went to a movie again.''         In 1936 she enrolled in the University of California at Berkeley, where she majored in philosophy. Despite expectations that she would proceed to law school or teaching, she went to New York with a friend, the poet Robert Horan, for about three years.         When she returned to the Bay Area, she led a bohemian life, tried her hand at writing plays and helped make experimental films. Married and divorced three times, she supported herself and her daughter, Gina James, by writing advertising copy, clerking in a bookstore and working as a cook, a seamstress and a textbook writer.         Ms. Kael never wrote movie criticism until she was 35 and, she said, ''I never made a living at this until I was in my 40's.'' Her career at The New Yorker did not begin until she was nearly 50.         The turning point in her life came, as in a Hollywood script, when she was discovered in a coffee shop in the Bay Area in 1953. She was arguing about a movie with a friend when the editor of City Lights magazine asked them each to review Chaplin's ''Limelight.'' The friend turned in nothing. Ms. Kael's review called the film ''slimelight,'' and a career was born.         Soon Ms. Kael was being published in magazines like Sight and Sound and Partisan Review, and her provocative criticism was being broadcast weekly on KPFA, Berkeley's listener-supported radio station. The radio criticism led to an offer to manage an art theater, which she turned into a two-screen house, the Berkeley Cinema Guild Theaters.         ''I made the displays, wrote the program and cleaned the chewing gum off the seats,'' she said. She revived W. C. Fields, Mae West and Busby Berkeley films and Welles's ''Touch of Evil'' (1958) and showed Ingmar Bergman films before they became staples of art houses elsewhere. ''It was exciting turning up things and drawing an audience to see them,'' she said.         The feisty, funny reviews that she wrote for the programs enhanced her reputation, and she began lecturing on film at universities in San Francisco and Los Angeles.         She was 46 when her essays in Partisan Review led to an offer to publish her first book, ''I Lost It at the Movies,'' a collection of her articles and broadcasts, which became a best seller. In it she praised movies like Jean Renoir's ''Grand Illusion'' (1937), Vittorio de Sica's ''Shoeshine'' (1946) and Martin Ritt's ''Hud'' (1963). She attacked other critics, poked fun at materialistic movie magnates and derided the pretensions of Alain Resnais's ''Last Year at Marienbad'' (1961), calling it ''the snow job in the ice palace.''         Assignments from magazines began to flow in, and in 1965, Ms. Kael, her daughter and Ms. Kael's two basenjis (dogs that, interestingly, cannot bark) moved to New York.         In 1968, in response to an offer from  William Shawn, the editor of The New Yorker, who was willing to let her write whatever she wanted and at length, Ms. Kael began to review movies for the magazine. Until 1979, she reviewed weekly from September through March, and Penelope Gilliatt reviewed for the other half of the year.         Ms. Kael's first review for The New Yorker was virtually the only rave that ''Bonnie and Clyde'' received in New York, but it compelled other critics to reconsider their assessments.         At 59, Ms. Kael left The New Yorker for Hollywood. She briefly worked as a production executive for Warren Beatty. After that job ended over what were described as ''artistic differences,'' Paramount Pictures put her under contract as a consultant and scout for several months before she returned to The New Yorker in 1980.         Ms. Gilliatt had departed, and Ms. Kael began writing every two weeks, commuting to New York from a Victorian home on four and a half acres in Massachusetts that she bought for $37,000 in 1970. In New York, she stayed in a hotel for four days and saw two movies nightly. Back home at night, she wrote. Her daughter, an artist, lived nearby with her family.         She is survived by her daughter, Ms. James, of Great Barrington, and a grandson, William Friedman, also of Great Barrington, and two sisters, Anne Wallach and Rose Makower, both of Berkeley.         Ms. Kael was reputed never to see a film more than once, yet she seemed to remember everything, from lighting and costumes to writing, sound, direction and performances.         In 1991, at 71, after 22 years at The New Yorker, Ms. Kael retired from regular reviewing.         Looking back on her impassioned love affair with movies, she once said, ''I was a film critic the way somebody might write poetry, for fun or love.''       
         Prof. Millie Almy, a psychologist and author who was among the first to advocate special training for teachers in early childhood education, died on Aug. 15 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 86.         Dr. Almy's early research convinced her that play was essential to healthy development and an ideal way for children to start learning the ways of the world around them. Previously, nursery school had been seen as a place to address a tot's safety and grooming, with few toys or challenging activities.         Dr. Almy was widely known for her studies of the mental, emotional and social development of the very young. Starting in the 1950's, she studied how they came to understand subjects like science and literature.         She principally taught at Teachers College of Columbia University and at the Graduate School of Education at the University of California, from which she retired in 1980.         Afterward, she was a Fulbright fellow at Macquarie University in New South Wales, Australia, and a visiting professor at Mills College in Oakland, Calif.         She wrote extensively in journals and books, some of which remain in print as classic textbooks. These include ''Children's Experiences Prior to First Grade and Success in Beginning Reading,'' ''Young Children's Thinking: Studies of Some Aspects of Piaget's Theory'' and, with Celia Genishi, ''Ways of Studying Children: An Observation Manual for Early Childhood Teachers.''         Millie Corinne Almy was born on a farm in Clymer, N.Y., and graduated from Vassar College in 1936. She received a master's in early childhood education and child development in 1945 and a doctorate in curriculum and teaching in 1948, both at Columbia Teachers College.         She started teaching at the University of Cincinnati. She returned to Columbia in 1952 and was a professor of psychology and education until 1971, the year she joined the faculty at Berkeley.         She left no immediate survivors.       
         Kay Teer Crawford, whose sympathy for high school girls who did not make the cheerleading squad in her Texas hometown led her to start one of the first of the drill teams, died on Aug. 29 at her home in Redondo Beach, Calif. She was 88.         Her son Kim said the reason earlier reports of her death listed her as 83 was that she had lopped five years off her age when she was 75 to increase her employment opportunities. Almost until her death, she actively promoted drill teams not just as entertainment but as a sport.         Mrs. Crawford, a cheerleader herself, came up with the concept of having sequined young women prancing about at sporting events around the time Gussie Nell Davis had the same idea with her Flaming Flashes in Greenville, Tex. Miss Davis went on to form the celebrated Kilgore Rangerettes of Kilgore College in Kilgore, Tex.         A Kilgore College history reports that Miss Davis began the Greenville troupe in 1928, two years before Mrs. Crawford started the Sergeanettes at Edinburg High School in Edinburg, Tex. But Janet Mar, Mrs. Crawford's personal assistant, insists that her boss was first with the inimitable combination of high-spirited marching, dancing and kicking that became an American tradition.         Whatever the chronology, Mrs. Crawford's contribution to the world of drill teams looms large. She brought the idea from Texas to Southern California, where she spent many years adding show-business glamour to plain old Texas strutting. She provided drill teams for 10 Super Bowls, 4 Rose Bowls and 7 Pro Bowls, and at the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, she put 1,268 drill team members through their lively paces.         Two years later, at the rededication of the Statue of Liberty, she fielded a team almost that large, including all-stars from every state. The next year, she helped orchestrate a celebration surrounding a mass by Pope John Paul II at Dodger Stadium in Los Angeles.         David Wolper, who produced the Olympic and Statue of Liberty shows, said: ''Kay recruited, trained and prepared thousands of young drill team girls for the events, and when Kay trained them, they were perfect. We have lost a real champion.''         Kay Waweehie Teer, whose mother was half-Cherokee and half-Comanche, was born on a farm near Granger, Tex., on Aug. 16, 1914. Her father moved off the farm to become the sheriff of Hidalgo County, Tex., where he made his wife and only child deputies so they could travel with him over the vast territory on official business.         He died shortly after moving to Edinburg to take a different law enforcement job. Mrs. Crawford and her mother then squatted in a succession of vacant houses, stealing from gardens to eat. Eventually, they moved in with relatives.         Mrs. Crawford won a coveted cheerleader position, but hated facing the envy and resentment of the 90 girls who did not make it. Inspired by the marching of Reserve Officer Training Corps cadets at a nearby junior college, she asked her principal to start what she at first called a spirit group, something that all the girls could join the next year. Her idea was accepted, and the Sergeanettes took the field in the fall of 1930.         ''All of the women were included,'' Ms. Mar said. ''Nobody got left out.''         Mrs. Crawford then worked her way through what is now Pan American University, where she earned an associate's degree, while cleaning toilets for money and wearing damaged clothing to make ends meet. She earned a bachelor's degree from Baylor University and a master's degree from the University of Texas, writing a thesis titled, ''The Educational Value of Drill Teams in the High School Curriculum.''         She took her drill team idea to El Centro High School in El Centro, Calif., and from there to San Diego High School and Santa Monica High School. She added props, from canes to matador capes, and persuaded a friend in the fabric business to develop nylon pompoms as a more versatile substitute for paper ones.         She then taught physical education and coached drill teams at Santa Monica College, whose president, Richard Moore, said, ''With her batons, hats and costumes, she established college pride, no matter what the prowess of the athletic crew.''         Mrs. Crawford coached cheerleaders for the University of Southern California, the University of California at Los Angeles, the Los Angeles Rams of the National Football League and the Los Angeles Express of the defunct United States Football League.         She opened a drill team summer camp, started an international competition for drill teams, founded and edited a magazine on the subject of drill teams, and wrote what some consider the definitive textbook on the subject.         Her husband, James H. Crawford, died several years ago after 54 years of marriage. A teetotaler, Mrs. Crawford met him while she was volunteering to greet returning veterans at a bar; he was the one wearing a marine uniform while drinking a glass of milk, their son Kim said.         Mrs. Crawford is survived by Kim, who lives in Dana Point, Calif.; another son, Jay, of Rolling Hills Estates, Calif.; a daughter, Jan Crawford of Torrance, Calif.; nine grandchildren; and three great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Crawford did not achieve her loftiest ambition. She had been heartily campaigning to make drill team competitions an Olympic sport.       
         Eileen Shanahan, a reporter for The New York Times who broke ground in the male-dominated world of economic news and later a news executive at other papers, died here today. She was 77.         She had been suffering from heart problems and rheumatoid arthritis, her daughter Mary Beth Waits said.         In 1971, The Washington Post reported an incident involving Ms. Shanahan and Maurice Stans, then head of the Department of Commerce, which Ms. Shanahan covered as a leading economic reporter for The Times. Mr. Stans had invited Ms. Shanahan to a reporters' lunch and, when she arrived, she found that the men who worked her beat were not there and that all the other reporters at the lunch were women.         ''Is this a ladies' luncheon?'' The Post quoted her as having asked loudly. Told that it was, she said: ''Then, in that case, I can't stay. I hope you will tell the secretary my reason for leaving. I consider it insulting to lump all women reporters together in a separate class.''         In addition to her work at The Times, from 1962 to 1977, Ms. Shanahan was an assistant managing editor at The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette and The Washington Star, and she was a reporter for The United Press, the Research Institute of America and The Journal of Commerce.         She was a speechwriter for the Treasury Department in the Kennedy administration and assistant secretary for public affairs in the Health, Education and Welfare Department under Jimmy Carter.         Ms. Shanahan left The Times in anger in 1977 after she found that, although she was regarded as one of the leading reporters in the Washington bureau, her salary ranked halfway down the list, according to an account by a Times colleague, Nan Robertson. Every reporter who was paid more was a man.         In her book ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times'' (Random House, 1992),  Ms. Robertson described Ms. Shanahan's reaction.         Ms. Shanahan said: ''I had always assumed that I was the victim of a degree of salary discrimination, probably on the unjust rationale that I didn't need the money because I had a husband with a good job.''         ''But in my darkest hour,'' she continued, ''I never imagined that my pay would place me in the lower half of the bureau's reporters.''         During this period, a group of women at The Times filed a discrimination suit against the newspaper. Ms. Shanahan was one of the original plaintiffs, but she had left the paper by the time it was settled in 1978. The Times paid $350,000 to settle the lawsuit and agreed to place significant numbers of women in all levels in every department. Later, efforts were made to equalize men's and women's salaries.         Ms. Shanahan was single-minded on the trail of a story and had a reputation for being sharp-tongued  with officials. ''She yelled at bureaucrats who were uncooperative,'' said Richard E. Mooney, who covered economics with her at The Times. A 1966 profile in Forbes magazine, headlined ''Eileen, the Giant Killer,'' described how she decided to write groundbreaking articles about abuses in the mutual fund industry.         She said that she had gotten the idea after noticing the way mutual fund companies entertained their regulators at a convention of the state commissioners who help to regulate the securities markets.         ''I'm not easily shocked,'' she told Forbes. ''I've been in Washington all my life. I was a Washington correspondent for The Journal of Commerce and a tax information officer for Douglas Dillon before I joined The Times. I've seen lobbyists entertain. I tell you this was shocking. They smelled up the hotel. I said to myself, If they feel they have to entertain the commissioners in this way to protect themselves against regulation, there must be something wrong.''         Ms. Shanahan grew up in Washington and received a bachelor's degree  from George Washington University in 1944. While in college, where she studied political science, she worked one summer as a clerk at The Washington Post. There, she met another George Washington student, John V. Waits Jr., whom she married in 1944. He died in 1995.         In addition to Ms. Waits, of Silver Spring, Md., Ms. Shanahan is survived by another daughter, Kathleen Waits of Tulsa, Okla.; a sister, Dr. Kathleen Shanahan Cohen of Teaneck, N.J.; and three grandchildren.         Mary Beth Waits related a technique her mother suggested she follow. ''If you're going in to a meeting with some man who you think is going to try to intimidate you,'' she had said, ''go in chewing gum. He may think you're crude, but he sure won't think you're intimidated.''       
         Peggy Mount, for many years the fearsome battle-ax of British stage and screen with a voice to make henpecked husbands tremble, died on Tuesday at a London nursing home for actors. She was 85.         Although best known for her bullying, harridan roles, Ms. Mount was also successful in classical theater with much praised performances as the nurse to Judi Dench's Juliet in Franco Zeffirelli's memorable Old Vic production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' in 1960 and in the title role of Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' at the Birmingham Repertory Theater in 1977.         She also made movies with major stars like Peter Sellers in ''The Naked Truth'' (1957) and Alec Guinness and Gina Lollobrigida in ''Hotel Paradiso'' (1966).         In the three years she played Emma Hornett, the iron-fisted, foghorn-voiced prospective mother-in-law in the 1955 West End farce ''Sailor Beware'' and in the subsequent film, Ms. Mount first made her name. One critic wrote of her performance in ''Sailor Beware'' that  ''with her hair scrapped up from her neck in a tight roll of curls, she is more intimidating than a fixed bayonet -- and with a voice to match.''         In 1971 she said, ''I'm not Lady Macbeth and never had any yearnings to be.''         Margaret Rose Mount was born on May 2, 1916, at Southend on Sea, the Essex seaside resort. Her childhood was unhappy. Her father died when she was 9, and she did not get along well with her mother.         The family's poverty forced her to leave school at 14 and work as a secretary. She discovered theater through the drama society at her church and studied acting privately.         She never married and left no immediate survivors.         She began her acting career in 1944 in repertory theater in the north of England and traveled all over the country until the success of ''Sailor Beware'' established her reputation.         She played similar dragon roles as Ada in a popular British television series called ''The Larkins'' in 1958 and in a similar series titled ''George and the Dragon'' in 1966. Later television credits included ''You're Only Young Twice'' and an appearance as a formidable Sister of Mercy in the ''Inspector Morse'' series.         During the rest of her career she continued to mix comedy with serious drama in London or on tour and the stage with films. In the 1970's she was a member of the National Theater Company, winning plaudits for her appearances in ''Il Campiello'' by Goldoni and Ben Travers's ''Plunder.''         From 1983 to 1985 she acted with the Royal Shakespeare Company in several plays, including ''The Dillon,'' ''Measure for Measure'' and a revival of the school farce ''The Happiest Days of Your Life.''         She was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1996.         She ended her career in 1998 when she lost her sight during a performance of Chekhov's ''Uncle Vanya.''         ''The audience had no idea,'' she said. ''But the word soon got out, and I lost my nerve. Not working is my greatest regret. It was always my wish to die working.''       
         Mitzi Myers, an internationally recognized authority on children's literature and a longtime lecturer at the University of California at Los Angeles, died on Nov. 5 at her temporary residence in Anaheim Hills, Calif. She was 62.         The cause was complications from pneumonia she contracted after a fire last year at her permanent home in Fullerton, Calif., said Patsy Myers, her sister.         Dr. Myers had been on medical leave from the university after the fire on Aug. 13, 2000, which left her with second- and third-degree burns and respiratory problems. She was injured when she repeatedly entered her burning home to save her renowned 35,000-volume library. Despite her efforts, most of the books were destroyed.         Dr. Myers, who once called herself ''the grand old queen of the footnote,'' published more than 75 scholarly articles. She was an editor of the forthcoming Norton Anthology of Children's Literature and contributed entries on children's literature to the Encylopedia Americana and the Cambridge Companion to Children's Literature.         At U.C.L.A., Dr. Myers taught courses on writing as well as on the history of children's literature.         In a paper presented to the Modern Language Association, she urged fellow scholars to study not only the texts of children's books but also the rips, dirt, spills, uncensored comments, drawings, scribbles, rude jokes and missing pages created by the readers because ''in these 'defacements' we discover the hidden history of childhood.''         Dr. Myers was born on Oct. 9, 1939, in Sulphur Springs, Tex. She received bachelor's and master's degrees from East Texas State University and a Ph.D. from Rice University in Houston.         Dr. Myers's husband, Dennis Hengeveld, died in 1983. She is survived by her sister, of San Francisco.       
         Mary Kay Ash, who built a billion-dollar beauty empire from a $5,000 investment in 1963, and who motivated hundreds of thousands of consultants around the world with a combination of rewards, recognition and religion, died yesterday at her home in Dallas. She was 83.         She died of natural causes, said Jim Lawrence, a spokesman for Mary Kay Inc. in Dallas. Mrs. Ash had been in frail health since she suffered a stroke in 1996.         Mrs. Ash, who preferred to be called Mary Kay, was 45 when she started her company, which sells its products through home and office demonstrations by sales representatives. Within two years, the company's wholesale sales had reached almost $1 million.         ''I've been asked a number of times, 'How did you succeed so quickly?' '' she once said. ''The answer is I was middle-aged, had varicose veins and I didn't have time to fool around. Have you heard the definition of a woman's needs? From 14 to 40, she needs good looks, from 40 to 60, she needs personality, and I'm here to tell you that after 60, she needs cash.'' Her company eventually became the largest direct seller of skin-care products in the country.         Last year, the company had sales of $1.2 billion and more than 850,000 sales consultants in 37 countries, ranging from Britain, Australia and Japan to Singapore and Brunei.         Mrs. Ash, who was known as the high priestess of pink, was one of the better known figures in Dallas. She drove a pink Cadillac and, for some years, lived in a $5 million, 30-room pink palace with 28-foot high ceilings, a Grecian pool, crystal chandeliers and 11 bathrooms, one of which duplicated that of her friend, Liberace. The house was sold in 1994, and Mrs. Ash, who was twice widowed and once divorced, returned to the old and less elaborate house where she lived alone. A security guard generally trailed her, even as she pushed her cart in the local supermarket.         Her almost mythical stature in her company was as glittering as her  diamonds. Her unique public popularity engendered such enthusiasm during the company's annual seminar, a three-day multimillion-dollar extravaganza, that she often had to use little-known passageways to elude her fans. More than 35,000 sales representatives and directors and, in some years, professors from the Harvard Business School, paid to attend the education sessions at her seminars in Dallas. The highlight of the seminar was Award Night, in which Mrs. Ash honored those who were the highest achievers for her company. The awards were presented amid a show that would rival those in Las Vegas.         The glitzy seminars were a far cry from the initial company get-together in 1964, held in a warehouse decorated with balloons and crepe paper. Mrs. Ash boned and cooked chicken for 200 people, made the jalapeno dressing and Jell-O salad herself and served it all on paper plates.         As the seminars grew in size and lavishness, the rewards to stellar sales representatives grew in kind. In later years, the annual awards amounted to about $6 million -- dream vacations, jewels, furs and pink Cadillacs (winners received a pink Mercedes in Germany and a pink top-of-the line Toyota in Taiwan). By 1994, 7,000 cars, valued at more than $100 million, had been given to sales representatives.         ''Recognition is the key,'' Mrs. Ash said, explaining her success and how she devised her corporate symbols to reward her sales force. One, labeled Ladder of Success, was a gold pin with each rung marked with a jewel. A ladder covered with diamonds signified a top performer.         Mary Kathyln Wagner was born in Hot Wells, Tex., on May 12, 1918. Her mother, who had trained as a nurse, worked as the manager of a restaurant. At the age of 7, an older brother and sister having already left home, she began cooking and caring for her father, an invalid who had been in a sanatorium with tuberculosis for three years         She was married at 17. Her husband, Ben Rogers, was a radio personality in Houston and a member of a musical group called Hawaiian Strummers. The couple had three children before he left to serve in World War II. On his return, he asked for a divorce and although Mrs. Ash acknowledged that the marriage had been unhappy, the request left her, as she put it, at ''the lowest point of my life.''         With three children to support it did, however, set her off on her career. She worked for 25 years in direct sales, pitching child psychology books at the outset and later conducting demonstrations for Stanley Home Products at parties organized in private homes.         The company that qualified for inclusion in the Fortune 500 list in 1992 opened its doors in September 1963, backed by a $5,000 bank account. Her second husband planned to go into the business with her but died of a heart attack a month before the start of the business. She decided to carry on with her plans, despite the advice of her lawyer and her accountant. The business opened with nine saleswomen and her 20-year-old son, Richard Rogers, a sales representative for Prudential Life Insurance, as financial administrator.         The skin-care products that formed the basis of the company were developed by J. W. Heath, an Arkansas tanner who noticed that his hands looked younger than his face and began experimenting with the solution he used in his work. The formulas were passed on to his daughter, Ova Heath Spoonemore, who, sometime later, acted as the hostess at a Stanley Home Products party where Mrs. Ash was conducting the demonstration. When that part of the get-together was over, Mrs. Spoonemore handed out jars with penciled labels to her guests, all of whom had beautiful skin. She explained to Mrs. Ash that the women were her guinea pigs. Mrs. Ash, who also received some samples, became a fan and in 1963 bought the formulas from the Heath heirs for $500.         The philosophy of the fledgling company was based on three principles enunciated by Mrs. Ash -- treating others as they themselves would like to be treated, putting God first, family second and career third, and the belief that with praise and encouragement, everyone could succeed.         Although the product line was added to over the years -- there are now more than 200 items for women and men in skin, hair, nail and body care and sun protection -- the Mary Kay formula for success changed little. Consultants remained independent, buying products at wholesale and selling at retail, and from the beginning there were no accounts receivable or personal checks accepted. Orders are paid for with cashier's checks, money orders or credit cards, and consultants are encouraged to conduct their own business in the same way.         In addition to her financial policy, Mrs. Ash also decided that there would be no fixed territories. Consultants who line up recruits in other cities and states still receive commissions on the recruits' purchases although the newcomers are trained and guided by the directors in their home territories. The unusual system worked because, as Mrs. Ash put it, ''each sales director thinks 'I'm helping her but someone else is helping my recruits in other cities.' ''         Shares of Mary Kay were listed in 1968, first in the over-the-counter market and eight years later on the New York Stock Exchange. In the early and mid-80's, sales declined and the stock price dropped. In 1985, the company returned to private family ownership through a $450 million leveraged buyout.         Mrs. Ash's third husband, Mel Ash, who was in the wholesale gift business, died in 1980. Her daughter, Marylyn Reed, died in 1991. She is survived by two sons, Richard and Ben, both of Dallas, 16 grandchildren, 28 great-grandchildren and one great-great-grandchild.         A friend once told Mrs. Ash, ''Mary Kay Cosmetics was a divine accident looking for a place to happen.'' Her reply summed up her philosophy: ''In 1963, the social forces that now support the financial and legal equality of women had not gained public favor. And yet here was a company that would give women all the opportunities I had never had. I don't think God wanted a world in which a woman would have to work 14 hours a day to support her family, as my mother had done. I believe he used this company as a vehicle to give women a chance.''

         Rachel Gurney, the British actress best known to American audiences as the elegant Lady Marjorie Bellamy on the popular 1970's serialized drama ''Upstairs, Downstairs,'' has died, according The Daily Telegraph of London. She was 81.         With fine features and a delicate stiff upper lip, Ms. Gurney was a natural for the role of Lady Marjorie, the wealthy Edwardian matriarch at the heart of the show, which chronicled three decades in the lives of an upper-class British family (upstairs) and their servants (down). Produced by London Weekend Television, the series was imported to the United States in 1973 as part of the Public Broadcasting Service's ''Masterpiece Theater,'' and instantly became one of most popular shows on public television.         Ms. Gurney's character proved particularly popular with viewers, who regularly sent fan mail addressed to her -- or her character -- to the show's fictional address, 165 Eaton Place, London. After two seasons with the show, however, Ms. Gurney left the program in a dramatic finale, as Lady Marjorie sailed to America -- almost -- on the maiden voyage of the Titanic.         Ms. Gurney's career proved considerably more bouyant. She was born in Eton, where her father was a housemaster at the school and where she was raised among the all-male student body. Her mother was a concert pianist, and Ms. Gurney soon found herself drawn to the arts, taking classes at the Webber Douglas Academy of Dramatic Art and later gravitating to London's West End.         For years before ''Upstairs, Downstairs,'' Ms. Gurney found steady work in the theater, playing modern and classical roles, including a 1955 turn as Portia in ''The Merchant of Venice'' and a 1965 run of ''A Winter's Tale,'' in which she played Hermione alongside John Gielgud. She also performed in several roles on television series for the BBC, though none as popular as Lady Marjorie.         It was only after she left ''Upstairs, Downstairs'' that Ms. Gurney was seen on the stage in New York, making her American stage debut in 1977 in a production of George Bernard Shaw's ''You Never Can Tell.'' She appeared on Broadway three times, including in ''The Dresser'' in 1981 and in ''Breaking the Code,'' with Derek Jacobi, in 1987. She would work with Sir Derek a year later in a trumpted production of ''Richard II'' in London.         She was married briefly, but divorced in 1950. She is survived by a daughter, according to The Telegraph.         For an actress so associated with highbrow entertainments, Ms. Gurney's true personality was considerably more humble. She claimed to hate opening nights -- ''I'm always awful'' -- and initially declined the role that ended up defining her career.         ''I'm not a heavyweight actor,'' she said in a 1981 interview. ''I don't crave great classic roles. I crave a part with a lot of laughs.''       
         Rose Shapiro, the president of the New York City Board of Education during one of its stormiest times, died last Saturday at a retirement home in Lauderville, Fla. She was 97 and a former resident of Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         Mrs. Shapiro, a campaigner for a strong parental voice in the schools, came to the board in 1963. Mayor Robert F. Wagner named her to a vacant seat and reappointed her to a full seven-year term two years later. She was the only woman on the board. Her colleagues ribbed her by referring to her as ''the sexy grandmother'' after adopting her proposal for sex education courses in the upper grades.         She was vice president of the board in mid-1967 and was voted acting president and president the following May. By then, Mayor John V. Lindsay was putting in place his plan for decentralizing the city's public schools system, starting with some demonstration districts.         One of the experiments in greater community control began with an elected local board for the Ocean Hill-Brownsville section of Brooklyn. It soon became the eye of a storm when classroom teachers who were deemed ''unwanted'' by the district leaders were ousted.         The situation spun out of hand when classes resumed in the fall of 1968. An angry central board ordered the reinstatement of the teachers. The local board balked. The teachers, led by Albert Shanker, the president of the United Federation of Teachers, organized a walkout.         There were angry street confrontations in Brooklyn and the central board itself split on how to proceed. At the behest of Mayor Lindsay, the board was enlarged and the new members named by him pressed his case for quick decentralization throughout the system.         Mrs. Shapiro, favoring a more gradual, carefully planned approach, lost her position as president. She left the board in the spring to serve as Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's special assistant for narcotics education programs. She also denounced Mayor Lindsay and the revamped school board. ''I believe I can say without equivocation,'' she said, ''that never in my experience has a city administration played such a disruptive role as has this administration.''         Mrs. Shapiro was born Rose Rubin in Russia and came to Ozone Park, Queens, as a toddler. Her parents afforded her a comfortable upbringing as the owners of a large general store.         She studied the history of education in night classes at City College for four years while working at a feature syndicate.         At 21, she married Morris Shapiro, a future civil rights lawyer. She became active in the League of Women Voters, but, with the couple's children in public school, she devoted her energy to the Parents and Teachers Association. In 1944 she was elected president of the citywide United Parents Association, helping to boost its strength from 80,000 to 250,000 dues-paying members in her four years in charge.         She also held leading positions in the Public Education Association and the Citizens Committee for Children. She attended several White House conferences on education.         Her husband died in 1985. She is survived by a son, James, a resident of Luxembourg; a daughter, Nina Agel of Manhattan; four grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.       
         Carrie Donovan, a fashion editor who could easily have rested on her laurels and leopard skins but came out of semiretirement to find a new and even more enthusiastic audience as ''the lady from Old Navy,'' died yesterday in Manhattan. She was 73.         She had been ailing for several months, said George O'Brien, a friend, and died at New York Weill Cornell Center.         From the beginning, Ms. Donovan's career had a screwball quality worthy of Hollywood. Though she studied dressmaking at the Parsons School of Design, she could never master a needle and thread. She lacked a similar command of automobiles and typewriters, and as a reporter for The New York Times, then as an editor for Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and The New York Times Magazine, she wrote all her copy by hand.         And though she was among the first to applaud the designs of Donna Karan and Perry Ellis and brought a virtually unknown Elsa Peretti to the attention of Tiffany, Ms. Donovan was something of an Auntie Mame when it came to managing her own affairs. Money was silk in her fingers, and the rest was often serendipity.         ''She was perfectly cast for a fashion editor,'' said Karl Lagerfeld, the designer. ''She was the leading lady of that role.''         What Ms. Donovan possessed was an eye for talent and a nose for news, a combination that, with her inevitable pearls and outsized black glasses, set her apart from her fashion sisters. She loved the fantastical, which was reflected in her Upper East Side apartment -- with its red walls, red furnishings and leopard carpeting -- but in her editorial pages she was adamantly on the side of readers. She may have been French in her leanings, sprinkling her pronouncements with French même choses, but in her translations of fashion's edicts, she was as American as Carrie.         As her mentor Diana Vreeland once told her: ''My dear, you've got the common touch!''         Nowhere did she apply this more surprisingly than in her television ads for Old Navy, which began running in fall 1997. In all, Ms. Donovan appeared in 42 spots, including one that featured her piloting an airplane with a dog named Magic. If Ms. Donovan, the last of a trilogy of great fashion dames that included Mrs. Vreeland and Carmel Snow of Bazaar, reigned in a small world, she now had fans everywhere. Teenagers and grandmothers alike hailed her in the street, sometimes singing an Old Navy jingle.         ''She was tickled pink,'' the director Joel Schumacher, a friend since the 1960's, said of her new visibility. ''It made her a celebrity.''         As a child in Lake Placid, N.Y., where Carolyn Gertrude Amelia Donovan was born on March 22, 1928, she craved fashion, and struggled with home economics. At 10, she sent the actress Jane Wyman sketches for a wardrobe, and received a handwritten reply.         Her first job was in the hat department at Saks under the imperious Tatiana Liberman, whose husband was Alexander Liberman of Vogue. By the time Ms. Donovan graduated from Parsons School of Design in 1950, she had formed friendships with two of the world's leading dressmakers, Norman Norell and Jacques Fath. More would follow.         But Ms. Donovan's outgoing personality masked an ambivalent relationship with her mother, Margaret, and an isolated childhood spent with grandparents. She and her sister, Joan Donovan, saw nothing of their father, who left the family early, and the girls did not live regularly with their mother until 1942, when the independent-minded Margaret was working for a war production factory in Brooklyn. She later received a teaching degree from Columbia University.         All her career, Ms. Donovan, who  is survived by her sister, of Cambridge, Mass., left the impression that she and Margaret were opposites.         In 1955, recognizing her limitations as a designer, Ms. Donovan went to work as a fashion reporter for The Times, where, according to Mr. O'Brien, a former colleague, she felt outgunned by more experienced writers. She persevered, snaring an interview with Mrs. Vreeland in 1963, when she went to Vogue, and Ms. Donovan soon joined the magazine as one of Mrs. Vreeland's acolytes.         At Vogue, Ms. Donovan flourished, filling her pages with the new and the exciting. She wrote about a young Mr. Schumacher when he and some friends opened a shop called Paraphernalia. On another occasion, a former staff member recalled being sent out to the lobby to tell a group of young men waiting for Ms. Donovan not to sit on the floor. They turned out to be Jim Morrison and the Doors.         She inherited Mrs. Vreeland's mannerisms, like the fortissimo ''divine!'' but not her mantle, and when Mrs. Vreeland was fired from Vogue in 1971, Ms. Donovan decamped for Bazaar. By then, Ms. Donovan had switched from wearing chaste Mainbocher to chic Halston, and like her friends, the decorators Chessy Rayner and Mica Ertegun, she had taken to covering her blond bob with a turban.         Like other editors of that era, Ms. Donovan was an instigator as well as a tastemaker. In February 1974, she helped bring Tiffany and Ms. Peretti together. The designer said Ms. Donovan had the idea that contemporary jewelry would bring the white-glove store a new customer. Today, that arrangement is a $250 million business. ''Nobody would do a favor like this now,'' Ms. Peretti said.         Unable to perform similar magic at Bloomingdale's, where she worked briefly as a public relations executive, Ms. Donovan returned to The Times in 1977 as style editor of the magazine. At their first meeting, Edward Klein, then editor of the magazine, recalled that Ms. Donovan produced some colored markers and began sketching out her plans, all in a brisk monologue of ''mmm's'' and exclamation points. Mr. Klein had no idea what she was talking about.         Ms. Donovan was not unaware of her effect, least of all on newspapermen. Armed with tidbits of fashion gossip and ''always fully fragranced,'' as a former protégée, Linda Wells, the editor of Allure, said, Ms. Donovan could turn a routine meeting into a performance. Yet, as her editors knew, her flamboyance was balanced by a pragmatic streak that for 16 years pleased both readers and advertisers.         These were her best years. She introduced readers to Ms. Karan and Paloma Picasso. She documented the opulence of the 1980's and ushered in the next decade by photographing the trendiest clothes on people in their 90's.         Although in many ways Ms. Donovan was simple in her tastes, preferring plain food and the subway, she was also at home in the upper reaches of fashion and society, a friend to Mr. Lagerfeld as well as the philanthropist Bunny Mellon. While this access improved her insight, it occasionally impaired her objectivity.         At the same time, her more dogmatic assertions often betrayed a deeper need to burn her bridges. She and Bill Blass, a frequent escort, fell out in 1993 when Ms. Donovan excluded him from a published list of 50 people who had influenced fashion in modern times.         In 1997, as if to disprove the dictum  that there are no second acts in American life, Ms. Donovan went to work for Old Navy, playing herself to the hilt. The ads, which brought her financial security, drew on her flamboyant image to promote earthly things like cargo pants.         ''She gave us fashion credibility,'' said Dennis Leggett, the creative director at Old Navy, a division of Gap.         In the final months of her life, Ms. Donovan returned to where her career had begun, The Times. She wrote in its magazine about a little-known designer named Marjan Pejoski, whose feathered-swan dress for the singer Bjork had caused a stir at the Academy Awards. She thought Mr. Pejoski had flair.

         Rosemary Brown, who as a middle-aged widow living in a London suburb in the 1960's said she had been in contact with history's most illustrious composers, offering as evidence hundreds of piano miniatures that she said Beethoven, Bach and others had ''dictated'' to her, died on Nov. 16 in London. She was 85.         The odd experiences she described -- which included shopping with Liszt (he was interested in the price of bananas) and watching television with Chopin (he was appalled) -- found a resonant audience in the era of the Beatles and flower power. More intriguingly, they attracted expert scrutiny and some approbation from such luminaries as Leonard Bernstein, along with tidal waves of more or less good-natured ridicule from most of the music establishment.         Mrs. Brown's credibility as a medium was buttressed by her own musical ignorance. She had just three years of piano instruction and could not play by ear or extemporize. There was no record player or radio in her home and she said she never went to concerts.         ''I seemed to lose control of my hands; it was as though someone were guiding them,'' she said of the first time she received a piece of music from Liszt.         Peter Katin, an outstanding interpreter of Chopin, was pleased to record many of the piano works, while the composer Humphrey Searle published an essay noting the similarity of Mrs. Brown's Liszt pieces with his later official compositions. Mr. Bernstein suggested he could ''buy,'' meaning accept, a piece by Rachmaninoff, but not much else.         André Previn, then conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra, said that if the newfound compositions were genuine, they would best have been left on the shelf.         But the British composer Richard Rodney Bennett seemed entirely convinced, at least at the time. He said that when he was having trouble with a composition of his own, Mrs. Brown passed along Debussy's recommendation. It worked.         ''If she is a fake, she is a brilliant one, and must have had years of training,'' he said in an interview in Time magazine. ''Some of the music is awful, but some is marvelous. I couldn't have faked the Beethoven.''         Regardless of how much Western music may or may not have been enriched by posthumous contributions channeled by Mrs. Brown, there was scant doubt of her entertainment value. She set off waves of interest in several appearances on British Broadcasting Corporation radio shows, the first in 1969. In the United States, she played at Town Hall in New York and appeared on ''The Tonight Show'' with Johnny Carson, telling him that her sources said there was no sex in heaven.         She described the various composers in often humorous detail. Beethoven, she said, was no longer deaf and had lost ''that crabby look.'' Debussy wore ''very bizarre clothes'' and was ''a hippie type.'' Chopin kept screaming something in French; it turned out to be a warning that her bathtub was overflowing.         Later she enjoyed visits from the ghosts of other celebrated people, including Shakespeare, Van Gogh and St. Paul. All the visits, she contended, were intended only to prove the existence of an afterlife.         Rosemary Dickeson was born on July 27, 1916, in southwest London. Her father was an electrician and her mother a catering manager. The family's apartment was above a dance hall, and she won dance contests as a girl. But her father vetoed a dancing career.         The most significant event of her youth occurred when she was 7. She had a vision of an elderly man with long white hair, wearing a black gown. He said he was Liszt. ''He told me that when I grow up, he would give me music,'' she said.         ''I've always had the ability, ever since I can remember, to see and hear people who are thought of as dead,'' she said in an interview with Newsweek.         In 1943, she contracted polio, which left her left side weak. When she was 15, she took a job as a clerk at the post office. When walking home from work one day, she said a voice told her to take a different route. A bombing raid struck her usual route.         In 1948, she got an upright piano and took lessons for the third time; as always, they lasted about a year.         In 1952, she married Charles Brown, a government scientist who had once worked as a gardener for King Farouk of Egypt. In 1961, her husband and her mother died. She began visiting spiritualists active in the emerging New Age thinking.         In 1964, she suffered an accident at the school kitchen where she worked and resumed playing the piano during her long recovery. That was when Liszt returned, as promised. She recognized him immediately, she said, and he arranged for the other composers to come, acting ''like sort of a reception desk.''         They took different approaches. Chopin told her what notes to play and pushed her fingers down on the right keys. Beethoven and Bach liked her to sit at a table and take dictation with a pencil. Schubert tried to sing his compositions, but ''he hasn't a very good voice,'' she said.         She was supported by contributions from people who believed in the occult. She wrote three books on her channeling, and made a number of recordings, some featuring her playing the easier pieces, the last in 1988. In the mid-1980's, the visits ceased as she fell into ill health. She is survived by a son and a daughter.         She always declined to ask her musical visitors the questions that outsiders thought would prove their existence. When Time offered her a list of 20 questions, she replied, ''I cannot push a button and call on the composers just like that.''         But when she needed notes for an album cover in 1970, Sir Donald Tovey, a musicologist, was pleased to provide them. ''It is the implications relevant to this phenomenon that we hope will stimulate sensitive interest,'' he said.         He had died in 1940.       
         Erica Van Acker, whose experience was the basis of a pioneering public television documentary on rape in 1971 and who became an early public spokeswoman for those who had been raped, died on Sept. 11 in the terrorist attack on the World Trade Center. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan and Sag Harbor, N.Y.         Details of her life came to light in research for a biographical sketch.         Ms. Van Acker, who was 30 when she was attacked in the hallway of her apartment building, became pregnant and had an abortion. The documentary, ''No Tears for Rachel,'' was made for Channel 13/ WNET and was broadcast nationally on ''Bill Moyers' Journal.'' After the showing of the documentary, she became an advocate. She would visit hospital emergency rooms to work with doctors to sensitize them to the feelings of those who had been raped.         Mr. Moyers said Ms. Van Acker ''took the chance because she really did want the public to know that rape is a crime where the victim is often made to feel guilty of the crime and to encourage others not to let the imposed sense of shame prevent them from talking to the police or the press.''         The documentary appeared not long before the rape law in New York State was changed to ease the requirement for corroborating evidence to prove a rape. Before the change, legal experts had argued that it was nearly impossible to convict someone of rape, because each aspect of the crime had to be corroborated by evidence other than the victim's testimony.         Though she acted as a child and trained in drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama in London, Ms. Van Acker made her career in business. She was involved in training and automation, often working in the early days of office computers to introduce top and middle-level executives to their unwanted desktops. She worked at Ticketron, then at the Off-Track Betting Corporation and at Citibank, before starting her own consulting firm, called VASA, with Gail Soltysik, whom Ms. Van Acker had hired at Citibank.         ''Rape and its aftermath take away any sense of control,'' she said in an article by Erika Duncan about ''No Tears for Rachel'' in 1995. ''But everything that I did afterward was about taking control. Every transition workshop, every seminar I conducted was somehow deeply out of that experience.''         When Ms. Soltysik left the consulting business, she and Ms. Van Acker bought the old train station in Water Mill, on Long Island, and eventually turned it into a restaurant, the Station Bistro. It was known for its food and its all-female staff. Ms. Van Acker planned the menus and did some of the cooking, including soups and her well-known lentil loaf. The restaurant was sold a year and a half ago.         Ms. Van Acker was working as a senior consultant on compensation at Aon Consulting when she died.         Ms. Van Acker was born in Manhattan. Her father was French, her mother English. She moved to England when she was 8. She has no immediate survivors. A memorial service was held Sept. 29 with a reception afterward at her former restaurant, now called Station Road.       
         Mary Whitehouse, a British schoolteacher and mother of three who for more than 30 years campaigned vociferously against sex, violence and blasphemy on television, stage and screen, died on Nov. 23 in Colchester, England. She was 91.         Variously called ''the most dangerous woman in Britain,'' ''the Queen of Clean'' and ''the Archangel of Anti-Smut,'' Mrs. Whitehouse became in the end a beloved national institution, though she achieved far less than she sought. She struggled tirelessly to quell a rising tide of libertarianism in British public entertainment as the country traversed the ''Swinging 60's'' and embraced the ''Permissive Society.''         Her case, put simply, was that television programs and theater obsessed with sex and violence would breed that kind of a society. Many people agreed with her.         She was not without effect. ''The Clean Up TV Campaign,'' which she started in 1964 and which the next year became the National Viewers and Listeners Association, influenced several pieces of British legislation.         These included the 1978 Protection of Children Act, which curbed the pornographic exploitation of minors; the Indecent Displays Acts of 1981, regulating shop window displays and magazine covers; the creation of a Broadcasting Standards Committee in 1988; and the 1990 Broadcasting Act, which dealt with television obscenity.         She was responsible for banning the Danish film ''The Sex Life of Jesus Christ'' in 1977. In 1979, she instigated Britain's first blasphemy trial in 52 years, which resulted in a suspended nine-month jail sentence for the editor of Gay News. In 1982, she brought, but later dropped, a private prosecution against Howard Brenton's play ''The Romans in Britain,'' which explicitly portrayed sexual acts.         Her bête noire was Sir Hugh Carleton Greene, the BBC's liberal director general from 1960 to 1969, whom she called ''the Devil incarnate.'' Not only did he ignore and snub her, he also used to throw darts at a picture of her he had acquired, which depicted her as having five breasts.         But even if the tasks she had set herself were possible, which seems doubtful today, her all-or-nothing, blunderbuss approach doomed her efforts to failure.         Beloved British comics were condemned along with obvious pornographers because they all used words like damn and bloody. Anything that included foul language, adultery or homosexuality was bad in her eyes, regardless of its artistic quality or overall moral stance.         As a result, she was soon attacking a lengthening list of admired and popular works, including the ''EastEnders'' television series; Lord Snowdon's acclaimed documentary about old age, ''Don't Count The Candles''; and Dennis Potter's ''Singing Detective.''         Mary Hutcheson was born in Nuneaton, in Cheshire, on June 13, 1910. She was a staunch Christian and member of the Moral Rearmament movement who at 20 fell in love with an older married man but left him when she saw the unhappiness she had caused his wife.         She trained as an art teacher, and in 1940 married Ernest Whitehouse, an engineer, who died last year. After raising three sons, who survive her, she returned to teaching in 1960, becoming senior mistress at a Shropshire secondary school, in charge of sex education.         This anonymous provincial existence changed in 1963 with the eruption of the Profumo sex scandal, when Mrs. Whitehouse was horrified to discover that her girls regarded Christine Keeler and Mandy Rice-Davies, the two call girls at the center of the affair, as heroines and role models. The next year she started her Clean Up TV Campaign.         Correction:  December 20, 2001, Thursday  An obituary on Dec. 3 about Mary Whitehouse, a British crusader against pornography, misidentified her native county. Her birthplace, Nuneaton, is in Warwickshire, not Cheshire.       
         LAST week, as the fiercely partisan legislators of the virtually bankrupt Nassau County turned blue in the face during an all-night fight over their 2002 budget, the inner schoolmarm, dormant since she left teaching for politics, emerged in the presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs. The county was just a few days and decimal points from a budget takeover by a state-appointed board, and instead of finding a solution to a $45 million deficit, from her vantage point, its legislators were behaving like kindergartners.         So she indulged in a momentary power trip, something she says she avoided in two years of playing peacemaker among 18 colleagues. Tired of banging her gavel and yelling for order in her court, she pressed an index finger to the mute button, effectively smothering every microphone in the room. The silence was shocking, and restorative: they reverted to adults.         Around 4:30 a.m., the exhausted legislators crept home after a budget was approved for perusal by the not-quite-lame-duck county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, who yesterday vetoed parts of it and cut a proposed property tax increase to 9 percent from the 15 percent that Ms. Jacobs and her fellow Democrats had supported. The budget now goes to the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the state chaperon, which has the power to take over the county's finances if it does not accept the budget. Though she admits to being ''on pins and needles,'' on that overlong evening Ms. Jacobs, a loquacious 62-year-old Democrat, was the only one to go home chuckling. Pushing the panic button was more fun than expected.         ''I don't like to use it,'' she says of the magical mute. ''I don't look at myself as Judge Judy, but I'll tell you the truth, I've learned to stop the nonsensible rhetoric when it gets really destructive. And that night it was out of control.''         She's still chuckling about it, her plump frame nestled into a brown leather couch in the den of the Woodbury split-level she says she has seen very little of in the past two years of budget crises. She loves her $67,000-a-year job, spending 10 or 11 hours a day at the office or out among the public that awarded her a third term and 80 percent of the vote as the representative for the county's Legislative District 16. This pit stop on the home front is such a rarity that she even had to reintroduce herself to the U.P.S. deliveryman who showed up with a package to add to the pile of wrapped Hanukkah presents (she has four grandchildren) in the dining room. ''He was shocked to see me here in broad daylight,'' she said.         Her silver Lexus with the vanity plates 1 JUJU rests in the driveway after a morning trip to the Woodbury Jewish Center to explain the proposed 15 percent tax increase to 150 elderly residents; she thinks she won them over by being honest. Her kitchen is Martha Stewart spotless, and why not? She confesses that it's hardly used. That enticing vanilla cake on the pedestal, the limes and lemons in clear canisters, the bowl of vegetables: all fakes. ''I never baked a cake that looked that good back when I actually cooked.''         But she is quite proficient with budget ingredients. According to her, without the 15 percent tax increase, Nassau, the black sheep of the state's counties for receiving a $45 million bailout to protect its bonds from junk bond status (''Embarrassing!''), won't have a workable 2002 budget. That's what she warned her morning audience. ''The response I got was, 'Just fix it already!' ''         But the Republicans continue to holler for cuts, and Ms. Jacobs, her color deepening beneath her pale perm, her manner revealing how she earned the reputation as ''the lady with the hammer'' back in her civic activist decades, insists that cuts are not a cure.         ''They have not been participants, they've been obstructionists,'' she says of the Republicans, then quotes a letter from the minority leader, Peter Schmitt, in response to her request to specify cuts. ''He said, 'My grandmother always used to say, if you have weeds in your garden, don't point to weeds in mine.' Now that is not an answer. Rhetoric is so cheap but so unrealistic at a time of distress like this,'' she adds. She says that if Democrats had had the stranglehold on Nassau County, she probably would have been a Republican; she's contrarian that way.         MS. JACOBS, who moved from Queens to Woodbury with her husband, Sid, in 1967, was politicized by a classic case of ''not in my backyard'': she awakened to the rumble of bulldozers ripping apart cornfields to make space for a decidedly unbucolic Geico insurance building. She and her neighbors protested, babes in arms, and were hauled off to the town offices for a talking-to by the police chief. ''We were the original Mad Mothers of Woodbury,'' she says. Next came her days of RAGE, an acronym for Residents Against Garbage Expansion.         She ran unsuccessfully for the Oyster Bay Town Board in 1977, but when the County Board of Supervisors was replaced by the County Legislature in 1995, she won a seat, a powerless seat. ''In 1996 there were six Democrats out of 19 legislators; if we'd all left for California for five years, nobody would have cared,'' she says. In 1999, the Democrats gained a majority and Ms. Jacobs became presiding officer, a position she hopes to retain despite backing a friend, Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, in the primary against Thomas R. Suozzi, the incoming county executive. That decision is expected this weekend, and Ms. Jacobs is not sweating it.         ''I don't mean to be corny,'' she says, ''but I like to believe you are what you've been.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Faith Hubley, a three-time Academy Award winner whose 50 animated films often combined elements of myth, jazz and a deeply felt humanism, died on Friday in New Haven. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         For more than 45 years Ms. Hubley made a film a year, an achievement that Dan McLaughlin, head of the animation workshop at the University of California at Los Angeles, called unbelievable. Her first 21 films were made in partnership with her husband, John, before his death in 1977. Her newest film, ''Northern Ice, Golden Sun,'' came out of the lab just a few days ago; its premiere is to be tomorrow at U.C.L.A., and it is to be shown Jan. 8 at the Museum of Modern Art as part of a celebration of Ms. Hubley's life.         Exploring what she called mythic landscapes, Ms. Hubley used primitive myths, magic and music and, in three classic films, the recorded voices of her four young children to comment on the world as it was, is and should be. A jazz fan who sometimes played the cello in her films, she used the works of Dizzy Gillespie, Benny Carter and Quincy Jones as background for what has been described as ''filmic poetry.'' Although the visual images of her later films evoke Miró and Klee, Ms. Hubley has described her films as close to cave painting. ''Northern Ice, Golden Sun,'' not quite seven minutes long, paints the deep attachment the Inuit feel toward the earth.         Ms. Hubley once said that the central thread that runs through her impressionistic, dreamlike and often whimsical films is ''human development, with a strong emphasis on the importance of children as people and on the environment people live in.''         When Faith and John Hubley married in 1955 and began making films together, they had only two marriage vows, according to Ms. Hubley. ''One was to eat with the children,'' she said. ''The other was to make one independent film a year.''         The Hubleys kept both promises, and filmmaking became a family affair. They won their first Academy Award in 1959 for ''Moonbird,'' an impressionistic account of young children at play whose unique soundtrack was the recorded voices of their two sons, Mark and Ray. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences would not change the name of the category in which they won from ''cartoons'' to ''animated films'' until 1971, but the Hubleys were already expanding cartoons beyond Disney.         Their second Oscar came in 1962, for ''The Hole,'' in which two construction workers debated nuclear destruction. Their third, in 1966, was for the buoyant ''Herb Alpert and the Tijuana Brass Double Feature,'' in which the band plays on as more and more people crowd into its automobile.         The Hubleys' work was the subject of a retrospective in 1998 at the Museum of Modern Art.         Until John Hubley's death during heart surgery, Ms. Hubley was considered the lesser partner in their work. When they met, he was already well known. At Disney he had worked as an art director on ''Bambi,'' ''Dumbo,'' ''Pinocchio,'' and ''The Rite of Spring'' episode of ''Fantasia.'' Staunchly pro-union, he had left Disney during a bitter strike in 1941 and then was a founder of United Productions of America, where he helped move animation away from Disney with the creation of ''Mr. Magoo'' and ''Gerald McBoing-Boing.''         Ms. Hubley, who grew up in Hell's Kitchen in Manhattan, had bolted from home at the age of 15 without finishing high school. Reticent in interviews about her childhood except to say that her parents had ''made no room for children,'' she created an intimate self-portrait on film in the 25-minute ''My Universe Inside Out'' (1996), which hints at child abuse and her parents' burning down the family house.         At 18, Ms. Hubley went to Hollywood. Because World War II had emptied the studios of young men, she got a job as a messenger at Columbia. She worked her way up to sound-effects editor, music editor and script clerk, and dreamed of being an independent filmmaker.         History gave her a shove in the right direction. Because of John Hubley's political activism, they were blacklisted. Returning to New York, they fed their growing family by working on commercials and educational films. Their first independent film, ''Adventures of an *,'' was finished the year after their marriage, right on schedule.         ''We could have been rich,'' Ms. Hubley recently told a reporter. ''But I told John, 'If you're an artist, you can't be a huckster.' ''         The Hubleys earned an Oscar nomination for ''Windy Day'' in 1968. This time the voices of the children were those of their two daughters, Emily and Georgia. In ''Cockaboody'' (1973), Emily and Georgia played at being grown-up mothers and glancingly mulled the death of their own mother.         When John died, the Hubleys were working on their 21st film, ''The Doonesbury Special.'' Finished by Ms. Hubley, Garry Trudeau and their longtime animator, Bill Littlejohn, the film became their seventh to be nominated for an Oscar.         After her husband's death, Ms. Hubley turned to larger themes and more abstract images. ''Step by Step'' (1979) projects mother love against the impossibility of protecting children in a world of foul water and limited food. ''Seers and Clowns'' (1994), which was animated by Ms. Hubley, both her daughters and Mr. Littlejohn, uses the words of Chief Seattle against metamorphosing images of wisdom and folly.         ''Faith was always timid about doing animation,'' said Mr. Littlejohn, who first worked with Ms. Hubley on the 1962 film ''The Hole.'' ''The strengths of her films were her brilliant designs and her strong ideas. And making one film a year is a standard no one else has approached.''         Ms. Hubley's solo films, usually a combination of her watercolor paintings and cel animation, often dealt in a poetic way with the treatment of women (''Witch Madness,'' 1999) and with pre-Christian myths. ''The Big Bang and Other Creation Myths'' gives no more credence to the scientific explanation of the beginning of the world than it does to half a dozen primitive beliefs.         At the time of her death, Ms. Hubley was a senior critic in the department of art at Yale University. In addition to her four children, she is survived by six grandchildren.         To the end, Ms. Hubley loved being an independent filmmaker. As she told an interviewer a few months ago: ''I am willing to pay the price: total financial anxiety all the time. I don't have any greed illusions. I need to eat, and that's that.''
