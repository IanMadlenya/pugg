         Mary Wesley, the popular British author whose sensual and often bitingly witty novels were not published until she reached her 70's, died on Monday in Totnes, Devon, her hometown in rural southwest England. She was 90.         Born Mary Aline Mynors Farmar, an Army officer's daughter, she was a lifelong writer who made her debut in 1968 with two books of fiction for children, ''Speaking Terms'' and ''The Sixth Seal.'' But her first novel for adults, ''Jumping the Queue,'' did not appear until 1983.         It was written in the years after the death of her second husband, Eric Siepmann, a journalist she married in 1952 and whose name she kept for the rest of her life. (Known as Mary Aline Siepmann, she adapted her pen name from her great-grandmother's name, Wellesley.)         Her husband's death had left her nearly penniless, with a teenage son to raise. ''Jumping the Queue'' tells of a middle-aged widow contemplating suicide and reflecting on her life as she encounters a fugitive wrestling with the same decision.         The novel offered original characterizations, playful allusions to sex and comic seriousness. It was critically acclaimed and despite its morbid theme, drew readers to her work.         Books by Mary Wesley then appeared almost annually through the 1980's and into the 90's. They often dealt with growing up middle-class in England, but American readers sought them, too, and many are still in print in the United States. Her last, ''Part of the Scenery,'' was published last year in Britain.         Ms. Wesley created ''an idiosyncratic fictional world, a middle-class English world,'' Michiko Kakutani wrote, reviewing the novel ''Second Fiddle'' in The New York Times in 1989. Her books' ''bright comic surface belies a dark subtext of sin, incest, murder and betrayal,'' Ms. Kakutani wrote, adding that ''cuckoldry and sexual gamesmanship thrive in her novels, and a chilly air of malice (or at the very least manipulation) that's reminiscent of Muriel Spark's work hovers over her characters.''         Born in 1912, Mary Farmar attended Queens College in London and the London School of Economics and Political Science before marrying Charles Swinfen Eady, a baron, in 1937. The marriage ended in 1944. She worked in the War Office during World War II, and her later writings reflected her wartime experiences.         She was the mother of three sons: William Siepmann, from her second marriage, and Roger and Toby Eady, from her first.         Unfazed by her late-blooming popularity, she once said that her chief claim to fame was ''arrested development -- getting my first novel published at the age of 70.''       
         Evelyn Abrams Mauss, whose lifelong political activism began when she organized the Junior International League for Peace and Freedom as a 14-year-old in 1929, died on Saturday at the Peninsula Hospital Center in Queens. She was 87 and lived in the Neponsit section of Queens.         She had passed out leaflets opposing an American attack on Iraq in Manhattan earlier and apparently suffered a heart attack on her return to Queens, her family said.         At her death, Dr. Mauss, a retired New York University physiologist, remained active in the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom. She was on the executive committee of the New York chapter of Physicians for Social Responsibility and had an office at the Natural Resources Defense Council in New York, where she was a consultant.         A native of Manhattan, she was the granddaughter and daughter of league members and suffragists. Her father was Morris Abrams, a manufacturer and philanthropist. She graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1936 and received her doctorate in science from Johns Hopkins University three years later.         She is survived by her husband of 64 years, Dr. Irving Mauss; two sons, Steven and Peter, and a daughter, Susan Tunick, all of New York City; two brothers, Dr. Herbert L. Abrams of Neponsit and Mason Adams of Manhattan; and a granddaughter.       
         Edith Hirsch, a former commodities economist, died on Jan. 7 at Georgetown University Hospital in Washington, D.C. She was 103.         Edith Hirsch and her husband, Julius, who was a macroeconomist, formed a consulting group in New York in 1941. Their clients included Levi Strauss, RCA, Bayer Pharmaceuticals and Schenley Distillers. Mrs. Hirsch specialized in agriculture trends and food distribution.         Mrs. Hirsch received a bachelor's degree in economics from the University of Heidelberg in 1925. The Hirsches fled Berlin in the 1930's, and they emigrated from Copenhagen after Germany invaded Denmark in 1940.         The couple taught at the New School for Social Research in New York, where she earned a master of social science degree in 1943.         Mrs. Hirsch was a consultant to the Department of Agriculture in the 1940's and 1950's. She wrote frequently about commodities for newspapers, although sometimes under her husband's name, and published ''Food Supplies in the Aftermath of World War II'' in 1993. Mrs. Hirsch disbanded the consulting firm when her husband died in 1961. She continued working into her 70's and moved to Washington in 1989.         Mrs. Hirsch is survived by her son, Rudolph, of Washington; three grandchildren, Stephanie Weinstein of Fairfax Station, Va., Andrew, of Coshocton, Ohio, and Claudia, of New York; as well as by four great-grandchildren.       
         Anita Borg, a computer scientist who devoted much of her career to the advancement of women in computer science, died on Sunday at her mother's home in Sonoma, Calif. She was 54.         The cause was brain cancer, said her husband, Winfried Wilcke.         Although highly respected as a computer scientist, Dr. Borg made her biggest mark as a champion and mentor of women in what has traditionally been a man's field. Through the several programs she founded, she became virtually synonymous with involving women in the emerging science.         In 1987, after returning from a technical conference where she was one of only a handful of women present, Dr. Borg started Systers, an electronic mailing list on technical subjects exclusively for women who are engineers.         ''Somewhere in the middle of doing all this technical research she realized that what she really wanted to do was not study computers but use computers to link people,'' said Brian Reid, who hired Dr. Borg into his research group at the Digital Equipment Corporation's Western Research Laboratory in Palo Alto, Calif., in 1986.         Dr. Borg was strict about who was allowed to be on the list, limiting recipients to women with highly technical training, and the discussions were rigorously confined to technical issues, said Maria Klawe, dean of engineering at Princeton University and a longtime friend of Dr. Borg.         ''When someone would go off topic, they would get a polite, personal message from Anita reminding them to stay on the subject,'' said Dr. Klawe, who joined the list 15 years ago.         The Systers list has since grown to include more than 2,500 women in 38 countries. Dr. Borg continued to run the list until she became ill in 2000.         Dr. Klawe, now president of the Association of Computing Machinery, said support from those on Systers helped her achieve that position.         Occasionally Dr. Borg loosened the rules to allow members to call attention to, say, advertisements that were demeaning to women. In 1992, when Mattel Inc. began selling a Barbie doll that said ''math class is tough,'' the voices of protest that started with the Systers list played a role in getting Mattel to remove that phrase from Barbie's microchip, Dr. Klawe said.         In 1994, Dr. Borg was co-founder of the Grace Hopper Celebration of Women, a conference held every two years focusing on the research and career interests of women in computing.         Dr. Borg left Digital in 1997 and joined the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research Center. Soon after she arrived in her new job, she founded the Institute for Women and Technology, or I.W.T., a nonprofit organization, in part to encourage women to consider entering the technology industry, even if it meant learning new skills.         Anita Borg Naffz was born in 1949 in Chicago. Her first interest was in mathematics, said her mother, Beverly Naffz.         Dr. Borg's bent for computer science emerged while she was attending New York University, where she received her Ph.D. in 1981. Her dissertation was on operating system principles, a highly technical subset of computer science.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Wilcke, of Los Altos Hills, Calif.; her mother, Ms. Naffz, of Sonoma.; and her sister, Lee Naffz, of Leavenworth, Wash.       
         Rose Augustine, a former chemistry teacher who with her husband revolutionized the world of the classical guitar by developing the nylon guitar string and who commissioned new works and underwrote concert series and competitions, died on April 21 in Manhattan. She was 93 and lived in Manhattan.         Trained as a pianist and passionate about the harpsichord, Mrs. Augustine often said that she did not much care for the guitar and its repertory. Yet anyone who has regularly attended guitar recitals in New York has probably encountered her: she was as likely to be seen at a debut as at a concert by a famous player, and chances are she helped pay for the concert.         The Spanish guitarist Andr√©s Segovia lived with Mrs. Augustine and her husband, Albert, for 11 years, starting in the late 1940's. Julian Bream, the greatest guitarist of the post-Segovia generation, never stopped in New York without visiting her Greenwich Village town house and leaving with a year's worth of Augustine Imperial guitar strings. And when she spotted young players who she felt were carrying on the Segovia tradition, she threw her influence behind their careers.         Mrs. Augustine was born in the Bronx in 1910 and earned a bachelor's degree at Hunter Colleger and a master's at Columbia University. She became a high school science teacher but went into the string business after World War II when her husband, a guitar maker, found that the gut strings traditionally used for the guitar's three treble strings were in short supply.         Mr. Augustine began experimenting with fishing line and eventually got in touch with an engineer at DuPont, who was skeptical about the filament's musical utility. The first samples were said to have had a metallic sound. But when Segovia commissioned a guitar from Mr. Augustine in 1946, he also expressed interest in nylon strings. The Augustines found a grinding machine, originally meant to make binoculars, at a war surplus store on Canal Street and reconfigured it to grind nylon guitar strings to the right thickness and consistency.         Segovia quickly became a champion of the new strings, which lasted longer and could be kept in tune more reliably than the strings guitarists had used for centuries. His use of the strings created a demand among both amateur and professional guitarists, and the Augustines began selling them in packages adorned with Segovia's picture and an endorsement over his signature. Other companies began using nylon as well, and it quickly supplanted gut as the standard for classical guitar treble strings.         Mrs. Augustine kept her teaching job during the early years of the family company, Albert Augustine Ltd., but worked nights filling orders. After her husband died in 1967, she took over the company, regularly updated its manufacturing processes and established a thriving market for her strings around the world.         During the 1980's Mrs. Augustine, who has no immediate survivors, began underwriting concerts, paying for series at the 92nd Street Y and at the Manhattan School of Music as well as festivals and competitions throughout the United States and in Europe. She also commissioned guitar works from about 20 composers.       
         Elizabeth Neuffer, the award-winning foreign correspondent for The Boston Globe who died on Friday in in an automobile accident in Iraq, had traveled there to cover the aftermath of the war. She was 46.         Ms. Neuffer was a passenger in a car that apparently struck a guardrail near Samarra, about halfway between Tikrit and Baghdad, The Globe said in a statement.         She was returning from an overnight trip to Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's ancestral home, where she had been reporting on efforts to dismantle the Baath Party apparatus that had helped enforce Mr. Hussein's government.         Her translator, Waleed Khalifa Hassan al-Dulami, was also killed.         Ms. Neuffer became European correspondent of The Globe, based in Berlin, in 1994, and spent much of her time reporting on fighting in the lands that once made up Yugoslavia. That assignment led to ''The Key to My Neighbor's House: Seeking Justice in Bosnia and Rwanda'' (Picador, 2002). The book, which was well received, grew out of a 10-part series in The Globe on war crimes in those countries.         Ms. Neuffer used two case studies, one of a Bosnian Muslim searching for information about his massacred family and the other about a Tutsi who testified about the rapes she endured in Rwanda, to study the meaning of atrocity.         In 1997, the series won the Novartis Prize for Excellence in International Journalism from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. Paul D. Wolfowitz, then dean of the school and now deputy defense secretary, said the series demonstrated ''exceptional qualities of reportorial perseverance, courage and commitment and brought important, unresolved issues to the public's attention.''         In 1998, Ms. Neuffer won a Courage in Journalism Award from the International Women's Media Foundation. In its citation, the foundation referred to a bomb explosion in a marketplace in Sarajevo in 1994 that killed 68 people.         ''She helped pick up the bodies and then wrote her story,'' the citation said.         In 1998 and 1999, Ms. Neuffer was an Edward R. Murrow fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.         She was born on June 15, 1956, in Quincy, Mass., and grew up in Wilton, Conn. She graduated from Cornell and received a master's in political philosophy from the London School of Economics and Political Science. Then she became deputy press secretary to Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut.         Ms. Neuffer moved to London, where she wrote freelance articles for The New York Times and other publications. She then worked as a reporter trainee at The Times before joining The Globe, where her first beat was federal court in Boston.         Surviving are her brother, Mark, and her companion, Peter S. Canellos, Washington bureau chief of The Globe.       
         Dorothy Nelkin, a New York University sociologist who chronicled the uneasy relationship between science and society, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, the university said.         Professor Nelkin, a prolific author who began her research at Cornell in 1963, was a close observer of science and how it is perceived -- and, often, misperceived -- by the public.         As a practical matter, that often involved giving warnings about the potential dangers posed by scientific advances that proceed unchecked by careful discussion of their implications. In an interview last year, she said it was hardly surprising that many nonscientists were unnerved by the commercialization of the human body, as scientists seek patents for genes and tissues.         ''If you are looking at the public image of the mad scientist or the scientist out of control,'' she said, ''the issue of patenting has aroused a lot of concerns. The public concern doesn't just come out of space. It comes out of real things that are happening.''         But Professor Nelkin, whose husband of 50 years, Mark Nelkin, is a physicist, was no enemy of science. Although her academic background was in the humanities and the social sciences, she was generally comfortable in the world of science, especially biology. Still, she kept her intellectual distance, believing that lay writers often had a tendency to lionize science.         ''She always saw science in relationship to society, and she never went native,'' said Prof. Troy Duster, a sociologist at N.Y.U.         Dorothy Wolfers Nelkin was born on July 30, 1933, in Boston and raised in Brookline, Mass. She earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell, where she met her husband. In addition to Mr. Nelkin, she is survived by a daughter, Lisa Nelkin of Baltimore; a sister, Nancy Wolfers of London; and a granddaughter.         Although she never earned more than a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Cornell, Professor Nelkin rose to hold one of N.Y.U.'s highest ranks, university professor.         She wrote or co-wrote 26 books, including ''Selling Science: How the Press Covers Science and Technology,'' ''The DNA Mystique: The Gene as a Cultural Icon'' and ''Body Bazaar: The Market for Human Tissue in the Biotechnology Age.'' She also served as an adviser to the federal government's Human Genome Project. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1983.         Much of her work focused on the friction between science and technology and the public. In the early years, she might have looked at how the location for a nuclear plant was chosen or workers' attitudes toward their safety. Over the past decade, though, her focus narrowed on DNA breakthroughs and their effect on the public. She recently began exploring the aesthetic of DNA, and its increasing depiction in art and popular culture.         The goal, colleagues said, was to lend perspective to a public alternately smitten and scared by scientific advances.         Professor Nelkin believed that the science would be unable to live up to the hopes floated by its promoters, many of whom stood to make a lot of money.         She worried, too, about the civil liberties issues raised by efforts to amass databases of people's DNA for crime-fighting purposes. And she was a firm skeptic about efforts to link behavior, especially criminal behavior, to heredity.         ''By making social factors irrelevant,'' she wrote, ''genetic explanations of crime provide convenient excuses for those seeking to dismantle the welfare state.''       
         Barbara B. Lazarus, an educational anthropologist who studied barriers to women entering science and engineering and created programs to overcome them, died last Tuesday in Pittsburgh. She was 57.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Marvin Sirbu, said.         Dr. Lazarus, who was associate provost for academic affairs at Carnegie Mellon University, was recognized for her creative methods of increasing the number of women in science and engineering at Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere. Her programs became models for other colleges, which often sought her help.         She also helped women's colleges in Asia find ways to help their graduates enter the work force. She combined her professional knowledge of the workplace with her personal experience with cancer -- she was first diagnosed in her early 30's -- to write about the problems cancer survivors face in their careers.         Dr. Lazarus started her work in Providence, R.I., in the early 1970's, developing materials to help telephone counselors advise women who wanted to enter or re-enter the work force. Later, as director of the Center for Women's Careers at Wellesley College, she adopted similar techniques to offer phone counseling to alumni who wanted help with their careers.         She also dreamed up a program now known as ''Explanatoids'' -- signs and videos at playgrounds, amusement parks and other sites to explain the science of everything from roller coasters to the curve balls being thrown at PNC Park, where the Pirates play.         The program will be extended to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington this fall.         Dr. Lazarus is survived by her husband; two children, Margaret Ann Lazarus Sirbu and Benjamin James Lazarus Sirbu; her parents, David and Betty Lazarus of Urbana, Ill., and Chilmark, Mass.; two brothers, William of Washington and Richard of Cabin John, Md.; and a sister, Mary Ann Lazarus of St. Louis.       
         Rollie McKenna, a photographer best known for her portraits of Dylan Thomas and other lions of English literature, died on June 14 in Northampton, Mass. She was 84 and had formerly lived in Stonington, Conn.         Rollie McKenna -- her full name was Rosalie Thorne McKenna -- found her calling at 30 when she bought her first camera on a visit to Paris. She was working as a researcher for Time and Life magazines, haunting the literary and artistic circles of the United States and Europe.         From the 1950's into the 80's, she specialized in literary stars, notably Thomas, the Welsh poet, to whom she was introduced in the early 1950's. She became his friend and principal portraitist and in 1955 made a film, ''The Days of Dylan Thomas,'' which won international prizes. She also published ''Portrait of Dylan: A Photographer's Memoir'' (1982).         Her first literary portrait was of Truman Capote, in Florence in 1950. Among her later subjects were W. H. Auden, T. S. Eliot, Edith Sitwell, Seamus Heaney, Sylvia Plath, Ted Hughes, John Minton, Ezra Pound, Robert Frost, Eleanor Roosevelt, Leonard Bernstein, the actor James Earl Jones and the United States poet laureate Richard Wilbur.         Mr. Wilbur wrote the foreword for her autobiography, ''A Life in Photography'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1991). He described the realm of her portraits as ''warm and sociable'' despite the diversity and difficulty of her subjects.         Her ''refusal to coerce or to use the intimidations of the studio,'' Mr. Wilbur wrote, ''are part of the genius of Rollie McKenna's portrait work.''         She approached portraiture as a modernist, using natural light for midrange shots in which the subject appears to have collaborated in choosing a setting and pose. The portraits are serious, for the most part, with exceptions like a laughing Mrs. Roosevelt taken for America Illustrated magazine in 1961.         Ms. McKenna's work was exhibited widely, most recently two years ago in a retrospective at the National Portrait Gallery in London. It was published in national magazines and books like ''Modern Poets: An American-British Anthology'' (1963) and her collection ''Writers and Artists.''         Rosalie Thorne was born in Houston and raised in Mississippi. She worked in a medical laboratory, did science research for Time magazine, served with the Naval Reserve in Washington in World War II and studied art history at Vassar College. She learned photography on her own to illustrate Italian Renaissance architecture.         She also took pictures of scenes in the American South and West and set up shop in New York as a commercial photographer. She wrote that trips to Europe meant a break from a souring marriage, and a visit to a friend in Kuwait in 1950 produced a harvest of pictures of local life, like Bedouin falconers.         That year, the writer John Malcolm Brinnin, her artistic mentor and lifelong friend, introduced her to Capote, and her future in portraiture.         Her marriage to Henry Dickson McKenna ended in divorce; there were no children.       
         Laura Rapaport Borsten, who was in the first group of 40 recruits accepted to be a Wave, a member of the women's Navy corps, died on Aug. 11 at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 91.         Her husband, Orin, said Mrs. Borsten, who lived in Los Angeles, kept up with other veterans and believed she was the last surviving member of the first group, made up of officer trainees.         Lt. Billy Ray Davis, a Navy spokesman, confirmed that Mrs. Borsten, then Laura Rapaport, joined as one of the first 40 Waves on Aug. 28, 1942. She rose to the rank of lieutenant commander.         President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the law creating the Women's Reserve of the Navy on July 30, 1942. The corps was soon christened Waves, for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service. Capt. Mildred McAfee, first director of the corps, suggested that it really meant ''Women Are Very Essential Sometimes.''         Organized to allow more men to be available for combat, women soon filled jobs like repairing aircraft, breaking enemy codes and serving as gunnery instructors. Many did clerical work.         Before the Waves, neither the women who served in World War I nor Navy nurses were permitted to become officers. Mrs. Borsten and her fellow officer trainees were greeted by newsreel cameras and autograph hunters when they reported for training at Smith College in Northampton, Mass.         By the end of the war, there were 8,000 Wave officers and 76,000 enlisted Waves. Though the name Wave was dropped in 1972, Navy women have gone on to command battleships and fighter squadrons, and rise to the rank of three-star admiral.         But they presented challenges to military tradition. For example, Miss McAfee decreed that Waves would be allowed to wear enough makeup ''to look human.''         Laura Golde Rapaport was born on a farm in McIntosh County, N.D., on Feb. 29, 1912.         She graduated from the University of Minnesota with honors in library science. Just as she was starting a job in adult education, Leo W. Schwarz, an author and lecturer on Jewish concerns, met her in Minneapolis. He asked her if she wanted a job in New York City.         She became director of international relations and social relations for the National Council of Jewish Women, and, among other things, helped bring Jews out of Hitler's Germany. In 1938, she testified a Senate committee against the equal-rights amendment, saying that it might jeopardize the gains women had made in areas like widows' pensions.         In 1942, she received a call from Elizabeth Reynard, a Barnard professor who was to become assistant director of the Waves. Professor Reynard said that Miss McAfee, who was to become Waves director, wondered if she was interested in joining.         Like most of the original 40 officer candidates, all of whom had distinguished themselves professionally, Miss Rapaport had no idea why she was asked.         After training at Smith, Miss Rapaport was selected to teach the 750 women arriving for officers' training. She was then assigned to teach officers and enlisted Waves at U.S.S. Hunter, the name the Navy had given Hunter College in the Bronx. She succeeded in her quiet campaign to recruit black officers, and helped forestall a proposal for segregated platoons.         Her last assignment was in Hawaii, the first posting of Waves outside the continental United States. As a transportation officer there, she learned to drive.         After her discharge, she visited her sister in Los Angeles. On a street corner, she saw Mr. Borsten, whom she had dated before the war. They were married a few months later.         In addition to him, Mrs. Borsten is survived by a son, Joseph Borsten of Los Angeles; a daughter, Joan Borsten Vidov of Los Angeles; a sister, Lillian Minkowski of Santa Cruz; and a grandson.       
         Nadia Younes, an Egyptian who was chief of staff for the senior United Nations representative in Iraq, Sergio Vieira de Mello, died in the bomb attack in Baghdad on Monday, the United Nations said on Wednesday. She was 57.         Mr. Vieira de Mello also died in the attack.         Earlier, Ms. Younes served as chief of protocol at the biggest gathering of world leaders the United Nations has every held, the meeting of 150 kings, presidents, prime ministers and dictators at its headquarters in New York in September 2000.         Ms. Younes was made chief protocol officer by Secretary General Kofi Annan in January 1998 and held the post until 2002. She had a major role in organizing the millennium summit meeting, as well as the responsibility for keeping feathers unruffled during the three-day gathering.         That the meeting, mainly devoted to brainstorming about the coming century, went off smoothly was in large measure attributed to Ms. Younes's dextrous handling of the assembled potentates.         Ms. Younes faced some tricky moments. The wife of a Saudi delegate, thrilled by a ride on a double-decker New York sightseeing bus, asked her how to buy one and take it home. And a mysterious figure identified as Count Carlo Marullo di Condojanni of the Sovereign Military Order of Malta somehow got himself into the official photo of world leaders.         From 1999 until 2001, Ms. Younes took time off from her protocol duties to serve as spokeswoman for Bernard Kouchner, the French politician and founder of Doctors Without Borders, while he was United Nations administrator in Kosovo.         From 1988 until 1993, she was deputy to the spokesman for the secretary general, serving Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar and Boutros Boutros-Ghali.         Nadia Younes was born in Cairo on June 13, 1946, and earned a bachelor's degree in English literature at Cairo University in 1966.         She joined the United Nations in 1970, at the same time beginning studies at New York University, where she earned a master's degree in political science and international relations in 1973. She transferred to the department of public information in 1974 and held a large number of press and information positions. In 1993 she went to Rome to head the United Nations information office there.         In 2002 she transferred to the World Health Organization in Geneva, where she took charge of external relations for Gro Harlem Brundtland, then the director general. Earlier this year she moved to Baghdad.         She is survived by a brother, Fouad Younes, of Cairo, and a sister, Nahed Fouad, of London.       
         Dr. Margaret A. Johns, who showed that pheromones can set off hormonal changes in mammals when they activate receptors in a tiny nasal cavity, a process that can attract animals of the opposite sex, died Saturday at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. She was 75.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter Sara Johns Griffen.         Scientists had known of the nasal structure, called the vomeronasal organ, on each side of the nasal septum, for more than a century. But it was widely believed that the organ had gradually become functionless and that the odorless chemical messages known as pheromones were detected instead by the olfactory system.         Dr. Johns's research, published in the journal Nature in 1978, led other scientists to question, and later debunk, the long-held notion that humans were incapable of sensing pheromones.         In recent years, research has suggested that the vomeronasal organ acts on the human brain in its hypothalamus, which produces hormones and regulates appetite, anxiety, fear and other behaviors.         In her experiment, Dr. Johns, a graduate student at the time, found that female rats would start to ovulate if exposed to an outside stimulus, like male urine. She then blocked off the vomeronasal organ in several female rats and repeated the procedure. This time, the urine had no effect, suggesting that the pheromones were acting not on the sense of smell, but on the organ many assumed had no real purpose.         ''There was evidence of pheromone communication in insects and invertebrates, but she was the first one to find it in mammals,'' said Dr. Louis Monti-Bloch, who worked on studies in the early 1990's proving that pheromones can induce behavioral changes in humans. ''That inspired studies that explored whether these same pheromones were having an effect in humans.''         Today, scientists are developing synthetic pheromones that could have a range of medical uses, like relieving anxiety and easing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.         Born in Boston, Margaret Anne Johns earned her bachelor's degree from Hunter College, but not until she was in her late 30's, after she had raised two children. She went on to receive her Ph.D. from the Institute of Animal Behavior at Rutgers University.         In the early 1980's, she did research at Mount Sinai in New York showing that cells within the pituitary gland could absorb serotonin. Her paper, published in the journal Endocrinology in 1982, suggested that the hormone might have an effect on the anterior pituitary gland in mammals, which helps to regulate growth and ovulation, among other things.         Whether serotonin influences the anterior pituitary is an issue that many scientists debate to this day, said Dr. Marc Freeman, a professor of biological science and neuroscience at Florida State University.         Dr. Johns's first marriage, to Craig Johns, ended in divorce in the early 80's.         In addition to her daughter Sara, who lives in Kinderhook, N.Y., she is survived by her husband, H. Peter Stern; another daughter, Kate Johns, of Old Chatham, N.Y.; a brother, Stephen Bush of San Pedro, Calif.; three stepchildren; and eight grandchildren.       
         Clare Le Corbeiller, a longtime curator of the decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         She had battled cancer for five years, said her husband, Jean Le Corbeiller.         Mrs. Corbeiller was widely knowledgeable in the decorative arts, specializing in Continental porcelain, metalwork and jewelry (with emphasis on 18th-century French) and Chinese export porcelain. She was also what might be called an old-school curator in that she was trained primarily through direct contact with objects, although she attended lectures in art history by Seymour Slive and Wolfgang Stechow during two years spent studying piano at Oberlin College.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller was born of American parents in 1931 in Cambridge, England, where her father was studying history. She grew up in Cleveland and in New York, where her mother worked at the Museum of Modern Art and as an editor at Lincoln Kirstein's magazine Dance Index.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller came to the Met as a summer volunteer in 1952 while studying advertising design at the Rhode Island School of Design. Except for a six-year absence in the early 1960's, when her two daughters were in the sandbox stage, she never left. She joined the museum's central cataloging department in 1953 and when that department was dissolved in 1959 -- an event that she saw as unfortunate -- she moved to the decorative arts department, known today as European Sculpture and Decorative Arts.         Mrs. Le Corbeiller's career both paralleled and contributed to the rise in prominence of the Met's European decorative arts holdings during the last 35 years. She was involved at all levels, micro to macro.         She systematized both the department's storage and its files, oversaw the installation of permanent galleries and period rooms, contributed to major exhibitions like ''The Arts Under Napoleon'' (1978) and guided acquisitions. With James Parker, she wrote the guide to the museum's Wrightsman Galleries (1979), the complex of spaces that display Jane Wrightsman's immense gift of French decorative arts; she also wrote the catalog for the gold boxes included in the gift (1977). She selected the porcelains for the museum's Jack and Belle Linsky Collection and also wrote its catalog (1984). With Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen she organized ''Chinese Export Porcelain'' at the Met in 2003 and wrote its catalog, published as the Winter 2003 issue of the museum's bulletin.         In addition, Mrs. Le Corbeiller published regularly in magazines like Apollo and taught in the Parsons/Cooper-Hewitt master's program and the Bard Graduate Center.         After her child-rearing hiatus, during which she wrote a book on American and European snuffboxes, Mrs. Le Corbeiller returned to the Met as an assistant curator in 1967, rising to full curator in 1991. She was named curator emerita upon her retirement in 2000. In her honor, the Met turned an issue of its annual Journal into a 319-page Festschrift; it contained essays by 28 colleagues from the museum and elsewhere, an in-house record in terms of contributors.         In addition to her husband, a teacher of mathematics and the history of science whom she married in 1958, Mrs. Le Corbeiller is survived two daughters, Suzanne Le Corbeiller of Pocatello, Idaho, and Genevi√©ve White of Pelham, N.Y., and four grandchildren.         Correction:  December 1, 2003, Monday  An obituary last Monday about Clare Le Corbeiller, a longtime curator of decorative arts at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, misspelled the given name of a donor of French decorative works. She is Jayne Wrightsman, not Jane.       
         Blanche Davis Blank, a social scientist and author who led Hunter College as interim president in the early 1990's, died on Friday at her home in New Rochelle, N.Y., her family said. She was 80.         Dr. Blank, a former social science dean at Hunter and academic dean at Yeshiva University, was acting president of Hunter College from 1993 until her retirement as professor emeritus two years later.         She was a founder and, from 1972 to 1980, chairwoman of the Hunter Institute for Trial Judges. She started it with Justice Hortense W. Gabel, a Hunter graduate like her, to provide a common forum for New York's judicial, legal, civic and academic communities.         She wrote several books, most recently a report for the Fund for Peace in Washington, ''It Takes Two to Tango: International Perspectives on the United Nations'' (1998).         One of her books still in print is ''The Not So Grand Jury: The Story of the Federal Grand Jury System'' (University Press of America, 1993). Stemming from her own two-year stint on a federal grand jury, it examines the system in theory and practice, its costs, problems and, in the author's view, excessive secrecy.         She was born in Brooklyn and graduated magna cum laude from Hunter in 1944. She received an M.A. in public administration from Syracuse in 1945 and a Ph.D. in American political institutions from Columbia in 1951.         She started as a lecturer at City College and the New School and returned to Hunter as an instructor in political science in 1956. Named a full professor in 1968, she was dean of the division of social sciences from 1972 until she joined the staff at Yeshiva University in 1977.         She was the academic dean at Yeshiva until 1981 and a political science professor until 1993. That year, the trustees of the City University recalled her as Hunter's acting president, to replace Paul LeClerc, who became president of the New York Public Library. She remained at Hunter, also teaching a course, until the long-delayed arrival of David A. Caputo as the college's 12th president in 1995.         Dr. Blank is survived by her husband of 58 years, Joseph S.; three daughters, Laura, Barbara and Alice, all of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.       
         Dr. Elizabeth Bates, a leading expert on the way infants develop language and an outspoken critic of the theory that humans are endowed at birth with a language module, died on Sunday at her home in San Diego. She was 56.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Jeffrey Elman, a close friend and a colleague at the University of California, San Diego.         Dr. Bates, a professor of cognitive science at U.C.S.D. and the director of its Center for Research in Language, was known for her very public stance in the debate on nature versus nurture, that is, how much of human behavior is genetic and how much is learned from the environment.         Dr. Bates thought all development, including the acquisition of language, rested on a foundation of general mental abilities. For example, humans drive cars not because their brains contain car-driving modules but by using various visual, motor and focusing skills, which are parts of the brain's wider repertoire.         Language is special and unique, Dr. Bates said, but its specialness is derived from the interaction of bits and pieces in the brain that are recruited for many purposes. Defining language as ''a new machine built out of old parts,'' Dr. Bates spent her career working out the details of that concept.         In putting forth her ideas, Dr. Bates criticized the theories of the linguist Noam Chomsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleague Dr. Steven Pinker, the psychology professor, now at Harvard. They contend that infants have a high degree of early knowledge and that development is more a matter of unfolding inborn traits.         Frequent sparring between the two sides, one based in California, the other in Massachusetts, led to the aphorism that much of cognitive neuroscience lay within the dynamic pull of a west pole and an east pole. Dr. Bates was ''queen of the west pole,'' Dr. Elman said.         Dr. Pinker said in an interview: ''As much as we locked horns, I had a huge amount of respect for her intellect and for keeping people like me honest. In anticipating her criticisms, she forced me to do better work.''         Dr. Bates conducted studies on more than 20 languages on four continents, showing how so-called universals of language like noun-verb agreement vary significantly in specific languages.         She studied infants born with extensive damage to the brain's language areas and found that their language abilities developed normally. In recent work, she found that there was a significant overlap in areas of the brain involved in processing language and areas involved in processing environmental sounds like trains whistling, cows mooing and doors slamming. She concluded that all these areas were specialized for meaningful sounds, not just language.         Elizabeth Ann Bates was born Wichita, Kan. After graduating from St. Louis University, she earned a doctorate in human development from the University of Chicago.         In 1983, she joined the psychology department at U.C.S.D. and in 1989 became the director of the Project in Cognitive and Neural Development at the Center for Research in Language. She wrote or was a co-author of 10 books, including the influential 1996 volume ''Rethinking Innateness,'' and more than 200 articles.         Dr. Bates is survived by her husband, George Carnevale, a fluid physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a daughter, Julia Carnevale.
