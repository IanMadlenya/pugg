        Rosa Slade Gragg, a civil rights advocate appointed in the 1940's to a national advisory post by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, died Monday at Harper Hospital. She was 86 years old.         Rosa Slade Gragg, a civil rights advocate appointed in the 1940's to a national advisory post by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, died Monday at Harper Hospital. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Gragg's work to improve racial relations in the United States began in the late 1930's with her association with Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor. In 1942 the President appointed Mrs. Gragg to a national advisory board of the Federal Office of Civil Defense.         In 1946 she founded the Slade-Gragg Academy of Practical Arts in Detroit. She and her husband, James, also opened a headquarters for the Association of Colored Women's Clubs, an organization that later elected her national president and president emeritus.         Mrs. Gragg, who lived in Detroit, is survived by a son, J. Robert Gragg, a retired probate judge; and two sisters, Ann Henderson and Marie Moore, and two grandchildren.       
        Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Frances (Fanny) Steloff, one of the country's most distinguished independent booksellers, died of pneumonia yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 101 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Steloff founded the Gotham Book Mart in 1920 and, over the years, turned it into an international literary haven. It is still thriving at 41 West 47th Street in Manhattan, an anachronism in a time of failing independent bookstores.         Soon after the store opened, it attracted authors, dramatists, poets and artists. Among those who came to chat, to browse and to see if their books and plays were on the shelves were Theodore Dreiser, John Dos Passos, H. L. Mencken and Eugene O'Neill. Her customers included George and Ira Gershwin, Ina Claire and Charlie Chaplin, and, more recently, Alexander Calder, Stephen Spender, Woody Allen, Saul Bellow, John Guare and Garson Kanin.         She championed the experimental and challenged the censors. Her courage in purchasing shipments of the banned ''Lady Chatterley's Lover'' directly from D. H. Lawrence in Italy in the late 1920's and in ordering smuggled copies of ''Tropic of Cancer'' from Henry Miller in Paris during the 1930's led to lawsuits and landmark decisions on censorship.         Although Miss Steloff sold the Gotham in 1967 to Andreas Brown, another book lover, she continued to live in an apartment on the third floor, above the store, and remained as a working consultant. She ignored her age and her semiretirement, descending every afternoon to sit at a desk in her own corner, occasionally jumping up to press books on browsers, and then to direct them to the cash register. Browsers Welcome         Essentially a person of no literary pretensions, Miss Steloff made her bookstore a place cherished as the habitat for the new and the avant-garde in literature, where small magazines and forgotten books of poetry, out-of-print books on belles-lettres and works on film and the theater could be found in an atmosphere congenial to browsers.         Under her guidance the Gotham became a meeting place for the literati and a bibliophile's paradise. The number of well-known writers, dancers, artists and theater people who were her customers, clients and friends made up an encyclopedia of 20th-century culture. At her 100th birthday celebration, on Dec. 31, 1987, greetings arrived from all over the world.         Miss Steloff was one of the founders of the James Joyce Society, which still meets at the Gotham, although she never met the author. ''Sylvia Beach took care of his book wants at Shakespeare & Company in Paris,'' she said. ''But sometimes Joyce ordered books from the Gotham directly by mail - including during the last year of his life.''         After working in several bookstores, she opened her own on West 45th Street in 1920. The store moved twice to larger quarters. ''It was a struggle at the beginning,'' she recalled. ''There were some days during the Depression when we didn't sell a single book.'' An Interest in the Mystical         ''I am not the great brilliant person to decide about how good a book is,'' she said once. ''I judge books by my customers who buy them and spark others to read them.'' She was greatly interested in Oriental teachings, mystical experiences and philosophers not connected with established Western churches. Books in these fields were represented in her corner of the store.         Along with its fame and reputation, the Gotham was also a very carefully operated book business. As the owner and the person who paid the salaries, Miss Steloff was demanding, irascible, unwearying and unable to understand why no one else was willing to put as many hours or as much concentration into the store as she did.         Miss Steloff recalled some of the clerks who had worked for the Gotham over the years. ''There was Allen Ginsberg and LeRoi Jones and many poets in their youth,'' she said. ''Tennessee Williams lasted less than a day - he couldn't get here on time in the morning and, also, he wasn't very good at wrapping packages.'' Sold Flowers in Hotels         Ida Frances Steloff was born Dec. 31, 1887, in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., a town full of gaiety in the summer and a bleak, wintry place for the rest of the year, especially for the poor. The Steloffs, who lived year round in Saratoga Springs, were among the very poor. When Miss Stefloff was little, she sold flowers on the verandas of the big hotels. The early death of her mother increased her misery, especially when her stepmother expressed her frustrations with poverty in the harshness she showed the children.         At 12, Miss Steloff was taken in by a couple who offered her a home. But she soon found herself a menial in the household and was forced to drop out of the seventh grade - her last formal schooling. Once in desperation she ran away to New York City. It was not until she was 19 that she made a final move to New York. She landed a job at Loeser's, a Brooklyn department store, working in ''corsets.'' But during the Christmas rush, she was transferred to the books department.         It was like giving a copy of Euclid to Isaac Newton: She had found herself and a way of life.         For the next 12 years she worked in various bookstores: Schulte, Brentano and McDevitt-Wilson, where she developed what one friend called ''an instinctive taste for the best in modern literature,'' a taste that she was willing to gamble on when she had her own shop. She never referred to Gotham as a store; it was always a ''shop.''         Her stature concealed her stamina. She ran the place, but she also opened the correspondence, wrapped and mailed packages, climbed up and down ladders and argued with publishers. Bookstore people were continually helping her down from ladders in her 80's. ''She feels,'' Mr. Brown said, ''as if she still has to stock the store.'' A Doctorate From Skidmore         Miss Steloff was awarded a prize by the National Institute of Arts and Letters for distinguished service to the arts, was listed in Who's Who in the Theater and received an honorary doctorate from Skidmore College - an award that stood in sharp contrast to one of her remarks:         ''I used to feel bitter and cheated about not having a formal education. But why should I? How could I, no matter what my education, ever have had the wonderful chance to have Thornton Wilder and other people talk to me personally, and right here in my shop! As if they were in their classrooms! I couldn't ask for anything more.''         A battle to save the bookstore ended last February, when Mr. Brown bought the building that houses the store from the American Friends of the Hebrew University Foundation. With the $1 million proceeds, the foundation has established a scholarship at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem in the name of Miss Steloff's parents.         It was quiet yesterday at the cozy bookstore, with a sprinkling of students and literary buffs brousing through the volumes. In the hall on the second floor hung oversized photographs of Miss Steloff - with Dylan Thomas in 1952, Anais Nin in 1966, Jean Cocteau in 1948, Salvador Dali in 1963, Marianne Moore in 1967. Memorial Service Is Planned         Although funeral arrangements were not yet complete, Mr. Brown said yesterday that Miss Steloff would be buried Monday in the family plot in the Jewish Cemetery at Saratoga Springs.         The Gotham will be closed on that day in her memory. Mr. Brown said he would post a sign and pictures of Miss Steloff in the bookstore window. A memorial service is to be held in three or four weeks, he said.         On May 11, Miss Steloff was to have been presented Brandeis University's Notable Achievement Award.         Miss Steloff was married to David Moss in 1923. They were divorced in 1930 and had no children.         Surviving are a half sister, Belle Sidoroff, of Wilmington, Del., and a half brother, Al Steloff, of Saratoga Springs, N.Y.

In 1979, the Catholic Church named her a Lady Commander with Star, Order of the Holy Sepulchre.         Miss Guilfoyle was born on Staten Island. She was an alumna of Hunter College and the Fordham University Law School.         Surviving is her mother, Ermina, of the Bronx.

She was also a lecturer at Columbia Law School from 1961 to 1965.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Robert; two sons, Jonathan, of Tenafly, and Joseph, of Los Angeles; a daughter, Rachel, of San Francisco, and a brother, Michael Bernstein, of Murray Hill, N.J.       
        Margot Zemach, an award-winning children's book illustrator and author whose witty, lively works reinterpreted folk tales for younger readers, died of Lou Gehrig's disease Sunday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 57 years old.         Margot Zemach, an award-winning children's book illustrator and author whose witty, lively works reinterpreted folk tales for younger readers, died of Lou Gehrig's disease Sunday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 57 years old.         Ms. Zemach was the illustrator or author of more than 40 children's books, including ''Duffy and the Devil,'' ''The Judge,'' ''A Penny a Look,'' ''Salt'' ''Mommy, Buy Me a China Doll,'' ''It Could Always Be Worse'' and ''To Hilda for Helping.''         ''Margot not only revivified the American picture book, but was one of the very few who helped elevate it to an art form,'' said Maurice Sendak, the children's book author and illustrator. ''She was one of the most accomplished picture-book artists on the international scene - a superlative draftsman, a shrewd psychologist and most important, a passionate, tragicomic original.'' Won the Caldecott Medal         ''I consider her the consummate illustrator for children's literature,'' said William Steig, the childrens' book author and illustrator, and a magazine artist for The New Yorker. ''There's no doubt her work will endure.''         In 1974, for ''Duffy and the Devil,'' Ms. Zemach won the Caldecott Medal, the most prestigious American award for children's book illustration, sponsored by the American Library Association. She was twice selected as the American nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration, the most prestigious international children's book award.         Ms. Zemach was born Nov. 30, 1931 in Los Angeles, and studied at the Los Angeles County Art Institute. She won a Fulbright Scholarship to study drawing in Vienna in 1955. Collaborated With Her Husband         In 1957, she and another Fulbright student, Harvey Fischtrom, were married and began a children's-book collaboration that was to last until her husband's death in 1974.         Their first book, ''Small Boy Is Listening,'' published under the double byline of Margot and Harve Zemach appeared in 1959. She did the drawings and he wrote the text.         At the time of her death Ms. Zemach was working on a picture book of ''Mother Goose'' nursery rhymes. Her principal publisher, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, plans to issue it in 1990.         She is survived by her stepfather, Benjamin; a sister, Amielle; four daughters, Heidi, Rachel, Rebecca and Kaethe Zemach-Bersin, and two granddaughters.       
        Karen Ulane, a Vietnam War combat pilot who was discharged by Eastern Airlines after a sex-change operation in 1980, was killed Monday in the crash of a charter plane. She was 48 years old and lived in Aurora.         Karen Ulane, a Vietnam War combat pilot who was discharged by Eastern Airlines after a sex-change operation in 1980, was killed Monday in the crash of a charter plane. She was 48 years old and lived in Aurora.         Ms. Ulane, known until her surgery as Kenneth Ulane, died in the crash of a twin-propeller DC-3 owned by an air taxi and cargo service in a field near here. Two others aboard were also killed.         Ms. Ulane had the sex-change operation in 1980 after 12 years with Eastern. The airline dismissed her, citing possible safety hazards in stressful situations.         In 1983 Federal District Judge John F. Grady ordered reinstatement and $158,590 in back pay and other expenses, saying the 1964 Federal anti-discrimination law protects transsexuals. An appeals court disagreed and reversed the decision.         Ms. Ulane eventually received a settlement from Eastern that was ''substantially more'' than the amount ordered by Judge Grady, said her attorney, Dean Dickie.         Kenneth Ulane flew combat missions in Vietnam from 1964 to 1968.         Survivors include her mother and a son from a marriage while she was Kenneth Ulane.

        Sadie Tanner Mosell Alexander, a lawyer and civil rights advocate for 50 years who achieved a number of academic and professional distinctions as a black woman, died of pneumonia Wednesday at Cathedral Village, a retirement community, in Philadelphia. She was 91 years old and had been hospitalized with Alzheimer's disease in Cathedral Village since 1983.         Sadie Tanner Mosell Alexander, a lawyer and civil rights advocate for 50 years who achieved a number of academic and professional distinctions as a black woman, died of pneumonia Wednesday at Cathedral Village, a retirement community, in Philadelphia. She was 91 years old and had been hospitalized with Alzheimer's disease in Cathedral Village since 1983.         Mrs. Alexander was appointed by Harry S. Truman to the President's Committee on Civil Rights, which issued a report in 1948 that cited the gap between American ideals and practice. In 1981 President Jimmy Carter named her chairwoman of the White House Conference on Aging.         On June 15, 1921, she became the second black woman in the United States to receive a Ph.D.; the first, Georgiana Simpson, got the degree a day earlier at the University of Chicago. Mrs. Alexander was also the first black woman in the nation to get a Ph.D. in economics and the first to receive a doctorate from the University of Pennsylvania.         In 1927, she became the first black woman to graduate from the University of Pennsylvania's Law School; her father had been the first black man to graduate from the school. And she became the first black woman to pass the Pennsylvania bar.         Before receiving her doctorate in economics, Mrs. Alexander had been the first national president of the black women's sorority, Delta Sigma Theta. Leader in Philadelphia         Mrs. Alexander practiced law with her husband, Raymond Pace Alexander, a Harvard Law School graduate, until he became a judge in the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia. In the 1940's, she was assistant city solicitor in Philadelphia. Two decades later she headed the city's Commission on Human Rights.         She was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, Americans for Democratic Action and a board member of the National Urban League.         Mrs. Alexander's grandfather was Bishop Benjamin Tucker of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, which was founded in Philadelphia. Her uncle was the 19th-century artist Henry Tanner.         Mrs. Alexander leaves two daughters, Rae Alexander-Minter, who is director of public programs in education at the New-York Historical Society, and Mary A. Brown of Washington; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
        Helen Lehman Buttenwieser, among the first women admitted to the City Bar Association in New York and a civic leader, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Helen Lehman Buttenwieser, among the first women admitted to the City Bar Association in New York and a civic leader, died of heart failure yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         As one of the city's earliest and most notable female lawyers, Mrs. Buttenwieser bore the admiration of younger generations modestly, with self-deprecating humor and candor. When the City Bar Association honored her last year at an annual dinner, she noted dryly, ''I'd rather be reading a book.''         As a scion of a powerful family, she followed in its tradition of advocacy, philanthropy and concern for social issues. ''Public service is an obligation,'' Mrs. Buttenwieser once declared. 'Embodied the Concept'         Two passions ruled her professional life: the law and civil liberties. They merged when she became the first chairwoman of the Legal Aid Society, an organization she served for more than 50 years.         ''She embodied the concept of public service, and that her profession recognize its responsibility to people unable to represent themselves,'' said Alexander D. Forger, the current chairman of the Legal Aid Society and chairman of the Manhattan law firm of Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy. As Legal Aid's first chairwoman, she nevertheless insisted on being referred to as chairman, rather than chairperson.         ''That was her style,'' Mr. Forger said. ''She was of the old school, where matters of gender were less important than doing the job.''         Mrs. Buttenwieser, who was born in Manhattan, was the daughter of two leading figures of ''our crowd,'' the 100 or so German Jewish families who founded leading banking, securities and retailing empires. Her mother, Adele Lewisohn, was the daughter of Adolph Lewisohn, who made his fortune shipping mining products. Her father was Arthur Lehman of the investment banking family. Her uncle, Herbert H. Lehman, was a New York Governor and a United States Senator from New York. Another uncle, Irving Lehman, was Chief Judge of the State Court of Appeals. Worked in Settlement House         After two years at Connecticut College, she left and enrolled at the New York School of Social Work. Then, she worked in child guidance in a settlement house. In 1930, she was appointed to the Board of Child Welfare. She turned to the law when she aspired to a judgeship in what is now Family Court.         In 1929, she married Benjamin J. Buttenwieser, a partner in the investment banking firm of Kuhn, Loeb & Company. In a typical ''our crowd'' twist, one of her husband's partners wed her sister, and the firm later merged with Lehman Brothers, the family firm.         She graduated from New York University Law School and became the first woman to work at the law firm of Cravath, Swaine & Moore. She left after a year because of the impending birth of a child.         Mrs. Buttenwieser then set out to fashion a life that would enable her to fuse work, family and community service. She founded her own office and practiced law in Manhattan for 50 years, until she retired in 1986. ''I decided when you get to be 80, you retire,'' she said. A Busy Volunteer         Her volunteer activities continued throughout her life and included many firsts. In 1939, she was the first chairwoman of a standing committee of the New York County Bar Association. Ten years later, she was elected trustee of the Title Guarantee and Trust Company, the first female director of a prominent banking concern.         She was chairwoman of the New York City Committee on Adoptions and often served as a pro bono lawyer for children's aid organizations. Mrs. Buttenwieser and her husband frequently opened their home to foster children.         When asked how she had been able to accomplish so much, she often credited ''a good husband.'' The two were a familiar sight at their regular table at Le Perigord, where they dined every Saturday at 8 P.M. precisely and where they recently celebrated their 60th anniversary.         Mr. Buttenwieser, a prominent philanthropist and civic leader, nurtured his wife's career and shared her causes. Mrs. Buttenwieser, as a tireless defender of Alger Hiss, the former State Department official who was convicted of perjury in 1950 after trials that mesmerized the nation, was the host for Sunday brunches at her home, where the defendant and his advisers and friends would gather. 'Fundamental Values'         ''She was a woman of great spirit and fundamental values - human rights, decency and the quality of individuals,'' said Oscar M. Ruebhausen, a longtime neighbor and retired partner of Debevoise & Plimpton, the firm that defended Mr. Hiss.         Mrs. Buttenwieser put her money where her beliefs were. She was an investor in The Nation, the liberal magazine. She formed a coalition of small family foundations, Joint Foundation Support, to serve philanthropists by providing information on the effectiveness of nonprofit organizations.         She was also a former trustee of the New York Civil Liberties Union, a former board member of the Citizens Committee for Children, a former chairwoman of Madison House, a former president of the New York Federation of Jewish Charities, a former board member of the Legal Defense Fund and a former member of the Mayor's Committee on the Judiciary.         She was a donor of Adele Lehman Hall at Barnard College, named for her mother, and was a former trustee of Connecticut College and a former board member of the Columbia University School of Social Work and the Dalton School.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a sister, Frances L. Loeb of Manhattan; three sons, Lawrence, of Manhattan, Peter, of Philadelphia, and Paul, of Boston; nine grandchildren and one great-granddaughter.

        Eliana Martinez, an AIDS patient whose mother successfully fought a court ruling that the child be in a glass cage in school classes, died of the disease on Monday. She was 8 years old.         Eliana Martinez, an AIDS patient whose mother successfully fought a court ruling that the child be in a glass cage in school classes, died of the disease on Monday. She was 8 years old.         Eliana contracted AIDS as an infant from a tainted blood transfusion. The disease was not diagnosed until 1985.         Her mother, Rosa Martinez, a licensed practical nurse, adopted her as an abandoned 11-month-old in a Puerto Rico hospital.         Officials of the Hillsborough County School Board officials had wanted the child kept home, fearing she posed a health risk. A judge ruled Eliana could attend school if she stayed inside a special glass booth. But Mrs. Martinez appealed the decision. In April Eliana went to school for children with special needs, without the enclosure.       
        D'Jaris Hinton Watson, an administrator for three New York City mayors, died of cancer Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         D'Jaris Hinton Watson, an administrator for three New York City mayors, died of cancer Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 61 years old.         Mrs. Watson, a native of Columbia, S.C., retired earlier this year as special assistant for development to the president of the City University of New York Graduate Center.         She spent much of her career in administrative work and with government agencies. President John F. Kennedy appointed her to his Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, and she was reappointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson.         She worked under three mayors, Robert S. Wagner, John V. Lindsay and Abraham D. Beame, serving on the Mayor's Committee on the Judiciary, the New York City Youth Board, the advisory council of the Department of Welfare and the executive committee of the Criminal Justice Coordinating Council. Began in Philadelphia         Mrs. Watson began her career as a public information specialist for Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr. of Philadelphia. She came to Manhattan 33 years ago, after her marriage, and worked in administrative capacities for the Citizens Committee for Children of New York City and the Ford Foundation.
