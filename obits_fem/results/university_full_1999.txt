         Mary Ann Unger, a sculptor and curator, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 53.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Born in New York in 1945, Ms. Unger began making sculpture as a child in art classes at the Museum of Modern Art. In 1967, she received a bachelor's degree in art at Mount Holyoke College, where she learned to weld, cast bronze and carve marble. After a year of graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley, she spent several years traveling, including a trip alone through North Africa. She then received a master of fine arts degree in 1975 from Columbia University, where she studied with Ronald Bladen and George Sugarman. The playful, undulating shapes of the pieces she started exhibiting in the late 1970's reflected Mr. Sugarman's influence.         These evolved into tensile structures whose repeating arcs evoked both Islamic architecture and boughs of trees. The style served Ms. Unger well in numerous public commissions, mostly recently in 1991 with ''Ode to Tatlin,'' a pair of tall, crisp colonnadelike curving forms that face each other, forming a kind of elliptical gateway, at the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College.         After Ms. Unger's breast cancer was diagnosed in 1985, she exhibited a more expressionistic side in her art. Over the next several years she became known for dark, bulbous, beamlike forms that she often laid out or propped up in clusters. Made of hydrocal, a lightweight plaster, over steel armatures, with surfaces that appeared to be scarred and scorched, these pieces could suggest giant twigs, human limbs or sausages, as well as the aftermath of some mysterious ritual or catastrophe.         In their effort to conjure the body without actually depicting it, these works occupied a territory defined by Eva Hesse and Louise Bourgeois. But the pieces combined a sense of mythic power with a sensitivity to shape that was all their own, achieving a subtlety of expression that belied their monumental scale.         Ms. Unger's work is in the collections of the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her most recent solo show was at the Trans Hudson Gallery on West 13th Street in Manhattan in 1997. She had recently completed a series of works that are to be shown at Trans Hudson in May.         She is survived by her husband, Geoffrey Biddle, a photographer and  assistant chairman of photography at the Parsons School of Design; a daughter, Eve; her parents, William and Dorothy Unger of Tenafly, N.J., and a brother, Christopher Unger of Milwaukee.       
         Betty Bryant, who had such a satisfying childhood career in the backwaters of show business that she never bothered to try to top herself in the Broadway mainstream, died on Jan. 15 at her home in Park Ridge, Ill.         She was 76 and was recalled as the third generation of a family of showboat performers who brought corn  pone and culture to riverside mid-America.         If her life wasn't actually written by Edna Ferber or set to music by Jerome Kern, it was surely because Miss Bryant was only 4 when Ferber's novel ''Show Boat'' came out in 1926, two years before Kern and Oscar Hammerstein 2d translated it to the Broadway stage.         By then Miss Bryant was an experienced on-board performer, one who had made her acting debut at the age of 6 weeks, stoically (she didn't cry) portraying the slave girl Eliza's baby in the dash across the ice in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin.''         If ever an actress was at home in the theater it was she.         The family showboat was both her home and her stage, and for 20 years, until World War II helped bring the showboat era to an end, she spent her springs, summers and falls going from town to town along the Ohio River and its tributaries, sometimes stopping for several weeks in bigger river cities like Pittsburgh or Cincinnati.         During the off-season, with the boat tied up in West Virginia, the family would visit New York or Chicago, sometimes staging variety acts, sometimes just taking in the theatrical sights.         With her mother as her tutor, Miss Bryant managed to get her high school diploma from a cooperating school that monitored her progress.         Based on Miss Bryant's 1994 book ''Here Comes the Showboat'' (University Press of Kentucky), hers was an idyllic life and one she was certainly born to.         To say that show business was in her blood would be something of an understatement. Her grandfather, Sam Bryant, a onetime gardener at Buckingham Palace, had no known theatrical inclinations until he fell in love with a young Gilbert and Sullivan actress named Violet Chapman, who had inclinations enough for both of them.         After the couple married and came to the United States in 1884, it didn't take many years of nagging before Lady Violet, as she preferred to be known, had persuaded her husband to seek thespian adventure, initially, as it turned out, in a horse-drawn traveling medicine show in which Dr. Sam, as he was known, would hawk a cure-all mixture of gasoline and red pepper on the first night in a town, then stage a tent show on the second.         The couple's children, Billy and Florence, were part of the dodge from the beginning and by the time the family graduated to vaudeville a few years later, they had become the Four Bryants.         A chance summer booking on a turn-of-the-century Mississippi River showboat gave them the river bug. Within a few years, Dr. Sam and Captain Billy, as his son was soon known, had acquired first the Princess and then, in 1918, Bryant's New Showboat.         By then, Captain Billy had married the floating troupe's piano and calliope player, Josephine Costello, who gave birth to Betty four years later.         From her start in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' Miss Bryant swiftly advanced to other roles and vaudeville turns, including impressions of George M. Cohan and Eddie Cantor.         As the only member of her generation among the now six Bryants (although Aunt Florence was increasingly an absentee actress), she played boys as often as girls, but regardless of the sex, she soon learned, her forlorn character was sure to die before the final curtain.         That's because the Bryant plays tended to be heavy, heart-rending  melodramas, which never failed to delight their small-town audiences.         Captain Billy did stage an abridged version of ''Hamlet'' once,  but after he got a look at the dazed audience on its way out, he quickly reverted to more familiar fare, replacing it with ''Ten Nights in a Barroom,'' a sure audience pleaser, partly, no doubt, because Miss Bryant died so convincingly.         By the time she graduated to grown-up roles, Miss Bryant had mastered the psychological subtleties of the showboat method of melodrama.         As she wrote in her book, ''A dependable leading lady must be able to run, duck, fall, get up, fall again, crawl over a bed and under a dresser, scream, swing by a rope, deliver an uppercut, struggle and kick and still have enough breath left to say, 'If this is aristocracy, thank God I'm a country girl.' ''         At 20 she married a fellow showboat actor, Jat Herod, a jazz violinist who joined the Army and was soon entertaining troops, as he and his wife continued to do after the war.         She is survived by two daughters, JoAleene Miranda of Des Plaines, Ill., and Mary Perry of Park Ridge, and three grandchildren.         After their divorce in 1962, Miss Bryant, who never tried to win acting jobs in New York or Hollywood, settled in Park Ridge, where she directed amateur theatrical productions and frequently gave lectures on what it was like to grow up on a showboat.       
         Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California artist and conservationist who fought for the survival of sea otters, sea lions, mountain lions and other wild creatures, died on Jan. 21 at Wild Bird, her clifftop home above the Pacific in Big Sur, Calif. She was 85.         The cause was heart failure, reported the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which recently published a paean by her to Mother Nature.         Mrs. Owings, a former member of the California Parks Commission, led campaigns to protect the world's forests and oceans. The National Audubon Society honored her with a medal in 1983 and last year listed her among 100 individuals who had done the most to shape the environmental movement, along with Barry Commoner, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, William O. Douglas, Lady Bird Johnson, Stewart Udall and Morris K. Udall.         A native of Berkeley, Calif., she graduated from Mills College in 1934 and completed graduate studies in art the next year at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University. She had one-woman exhibitions of her stitchery at galleries and folk-art museums but largely set aside her art to work for conservation.         She and her second husband, Nathaniel Alexander Owings, a founding partner of the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, fought to keep the developers away from the wild beauty of Big Sur.         Seasonal residents of Santa Fe, N.M., they also assembled a collection of the art and Pueblo culture of the Southwest, now part of the collection of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.         Mrs. Owings was the founder and first president of Friends of the Sea Otter and won a battle to end the bounty-hunting of mountain lions in her state. As a member of the Point Lobos League she was instrumental in saving the beaches between the Carmel River and Point Lobos State Preserve, near Monterey.         She sat on the council of the Save-the-Redwoods League and the Big Sur Land Trust. She was a past trustee of Defenders of Wildlife, the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation and the Environmental Defense Fund, and a founder of the Rachel Carson Council.         She wrote about her experiences and spent the last months of her life compiling her writings and artwork. The resulting book, ''Voice From the Sea: Reflections on Wildlife and Wilderness'' was published weeks before her death.         Nathaniel Owings, who designed their home, Wild Bird, died in 1984.         Mrs. Owings is survived by a daughter, Wendy M. Benjamin, of Durango, Colo., from her previous marriage to Malcolm Millard, a resident of Carmel, Calif.; three stepdaughters, Natalie O. Prael and Jennifer O. Dewey, both of Santa Fe., and Emily O. Kapozi, of Novato, Calif.; a brother, William Wentworth, of Walnut Creek, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  February 2, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Sunday about Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California conservationist, omitted the name of a surviving stepson. He is Nathaniel O. Owings of Santa Fe, N.M.       
         Virginia Eloise Peterson Abelson, a former bookstore owner and past Democratic Party district leader who also worked in publishing and created crossword puzzles, died on Sunday at her home in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Abelson, a native of Red Oak, Iowa, graduated in 1948 from the University of Iowa, where she majored in English.         During the 1950's, she worked as an advertising director for Cambridge University Press of New York.         In the 1960's, she owned a store called Books Unltd. in Croton. For about 15 years, into the 1980's, she also contributed crossword puzzles that were published in The New York Times.         In the 1960's and 70's, Mrs. Abelson was a party district leader in Croton. She was also a member of the board of the Croton Community Nursery School.         Mrs. Abelson is survived by her husband, Alan, a columnist for Barron's magazine; a daughter, Reed Abelson of Manhattan, a business reporter at The Times; a son, Justin, of Greenfield, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Katherine Bain, a pediatrician who became a high-ranking and an outspoken Washington official concerned with the well-being of infants and children, died on Jan. 10 in a Washington nursing home she entered in October. She was 101 and had lived in Washington since 1940.         Dr. Bain's family said that she was the author or a co-author of reports that led to the development of child-proof safety caps for medicines and for chemicals in the home, safety-release standards for the doors of refrigerators in order to keep children from being trapped and suffocated, and some of the first Federal guidelines for the nutrition of children.         Her family said that she had carried out a pioneering survey of breast-feeding practices in American hospitals' nurseries and that her findings had led to changes in doctors' opinions of nursing.         In 1940, she joined the Children's Bureau, an agency that was then part of the Department of Labor and is now part of the Department of Health and Human Services. She was the bureau's deputy chief from 1958 to 1964 and became assistant to the director of the Public Health Service in a reorganization in 1969. She devoted herself to children's welfare issues in foreign countries for the next four years and retired.         In a report in The Journal of Pediatrics in 1954, Dr. Bain presented statistics that pointed up the carelessness of American families in protecting children in the home.         Analyzing data supplied by the National Office of Vital Statistics, she said that 400 children under the age of 5 died each year in the United States from accidental poisoning. That rate was four times the rate reported for England and Wales.         Two-thirds of the deaths from accidental poisoning could be prevented, Dr. Bain said, if aspirin, barbiturates, kerosene, lye, lead and arsenic compounds were kept out of the hands of small children.         In a report issued in 1944, Dr. Bain said that World War II had intensified the need for regular advice to mothers on how to keep their babies well. ''We have a bumper crop of babies,'' she said. ''Nearly three million will be born in the United States this year. At the same time we have a shortage of doctors and nurses for the civilian population. About 50 percent of our younger practicing physicians have gone into the armed forces.'' Dr. Bain said the United States would have to work hard and fast to increase its number of clinics aimed at keeping babies well.         After the war, she bemoaned disparities in medical care available in different parts of the United States. Speaking to 500 child health and welfare experts in 1948 in Chicago, she said that a survey had found ''that 1,000 children in Illinois have on an average day twice as much medical care as 1,000 children in Alabama.''         ''One can only conclude,'' Dr. Bain added, ''that children in Alabama are receiving at the most only one-half as much care as they need.''         The honors Dr. Bain received included an award in 1960 from the New York Infirmary for work she had done in pediatrics and public health.         Dr. Bain was born in St. Louis, received a bachelor's degree in 1920 from the University of Missouri and her medical degree in 1925 from Washington University in St. Louis. She spent 13 years in private pediatric practice in St. Louis before going to Washington.         She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Dr. Judith Silberpfennig Kestenberg, a psychoanalyst specializing in child development and the emotional state of Holocaust survivors and their children, died Saturday at her home in Sands Point, N.Y. She was 88.         Dr. Kestenberg headed Child Development Research, which she founded 30 years ago, and Holocaust Child Survivor Studies, both based in Sands Point. With her husband, Milton, she started the research center's International Study of the Organized Persecution of Children.         She and her associates traveled all over the world to collect taped interviews with more than 1,500 child survivors of the Holocaust and their children, as well as the children of Nazis. Fluent in French, German and Polish, she wrote two German books used to teach German children about the Holocaust.         Judith Silberpfennig was born in Tarnov, Poland, and trained in medicine, neurology and psychiatry in Vienna. She came to New York in 1937 and completed her training at Bellevue Hospital and the New York Psychological Institute.         Her husband was born in Lodz, Poland, and became a lawyer there before coming to the United States in 1939. He managed real estate in New York and, after World War II, sued in German courts to seek compensation for Holocaust victims and also organized aid for their children.         They were married in the mid-1940's and became a team in their Holocaust pursuits when he started representing the victims, especially children, before the courts and found that many of them had only vague memories of their ordeals.         Dr. Kestenberg, a professor emeritus at New York University Medical School, taught generations of psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoanalysts and other experts on development, mental health and dance-movement therapy. She also was on the staff and faculty at Long Island Jewish Hospital.         She published seven books and some 150 professional articles. Most recently she edited, with Dr. Charlotte Kahn, ''Children Surviving Persecution: An International Study of Trauma and Healing'' (Greenwood, 1998).         Her other books in print include ''Sexuality, Body Movement and the Rhythms of Development'' (Aronson, 1995); with Dr. Ira Brenner, ''The Last Witness: The Child Survivor of the Holocaust'' (American Psychiatric Press, 1996), and, as editor with Dr. Eva Fogelman, ''Children During the Nazi Reign: Psychological Perspective on the Interview Process'' (Greenwood, 1994).         Milton Kestenberg died in 1991. Dr. Kestenberg is survived by a son, Howard, of Foxborough, Mass.; a daughter, Janet Kestenberg of West Chester, Pa., and four grandchildren.         Her work at Child Development Research is being continued by Dr. Fogelman and associates.       
         Dr. Miriam Freund-Rosenthal, a former national president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on Saturday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 92 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Dr. Freund-Rosenthal persuaded the artist Marc Chagall to create the stained glass windows for a synagogue in Jerusalem, endowed Hadassah educational seminars in the United States and Israel and wrote the book 'A Tapestry of Hadassah Memories.'' She and her second husband, Harry Rosenthal, also endowed clinics and parks in Israel through Hadassah.         During her presidency, from 1956 through 1960, a second hospital was built for the Hadassah medical center in Jerusalem, in the Ein Kerem neighborhood. It was dedicated in 1960.         Dr. Freund-Rosenthal, whose doctorate was in history from New York University, was known as Miriam K. Freund when she was Hadassah's president.         With about 300,000 members, Hadassah says it is the United States's largest women's organization, largest Jewish organization and largest Zionist organization.         Before and after Dr. Freund-Rosenthal was Hadassah's president, she held a variety of other posts overseeing the organization's education and youth programs. She was also prominent in other Zionist and Jewish communal organizations.         In a volume of memoirs, ''In My Lifetime'' (1989), she tells of her visit with the violinist Isaac Stern to Chagall in France. The artist agreed to create the design for the stained-glass windows that were to be installed in the synagogue in the Ein Kerem hospital complex, saying, ''I have always looked forward to a call from the Jewish people.'' Known as the Jerusalem windows, they have attracted immense numbers of visitors over the years.         Miriam Kottler Freund-Rosenthal was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Harry Kottler and the former Rebecca Zindler, and lived in Perth Amboy, N.J., and Harlem as a child. She received a bachelor's degree in 1925 from Hunter College and a master's degree and doctorate from N.Y.U. In 1935 she first visited what was then Palestine.         She taught in the New York City public school system for a decade and a half until the early 1940's, and was prominent in fund-raising for the founding of Brandeis University, which opened in 1948.         Her other writings include the books ''Jewish Merchants in Colonial America'' (1939) and ''Jewels for a Crown'' (1963).         In 1927, she married Milton B. Freund, a financier active in Jewish communal and religious affairs, who died in 1968. She married Harry Rosenthal, a businessman in St. Paul in 1974. He died in 1989.         Her survivors include two sons, Dr. Matthew Freund of Miami Beach; and Harry I. Freund of Harrison, N.Y. and Manhattan; 5 grandchildren; 10 great-grandchildren and 2 stepdaughters, Midge Decter of Manhattan, the political writer, and Connie Fields of St. Paul.       
         Mirra Komarovsky, a sociologist who was an innovative authority on gender, family and education, died on Saturday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 93.         Professor Komarovsky retired in 1970 after 32 years on the faculty of Barnard College. But she returned to Barnard in 1978 and became the chairwoman of its women's studies program for a time.         She was an advocate for women who has been credited with having initiated the contemporary analysis of gender roles with her book ''Women in the Modern World: Their Education and Their Dilemmas'' (1953, Irvington).         In that work she wrote that by making the purposes of women's education clearer, barriers to the attainment of a good life could be removed. As to the respective merits of training for a career and of education meant only for a homemaker, she wrote: ''To disagree with the antifeminist does not necessarily make one a feminist. We can reject the antifeminist program without having to embrace the old-fashioned feminism with its militant hostility towards, and its disparagement of, the homemaker.''         In 1991, Ellen V. Futter, who was Barnard's president at the time, said Professor Komarovsky's ''research has been crucial to our understanding of today's women and the choices they make.''         In that year Professor Komarovsky received the Distinguished Career Award of the American Sociological Association. Earlier, in 1973 and 1974, she was the second female president of the association, which was founded in 1905.         In her book ''Women in College: Shaping New Feminine Identities'' (1985) she described changing views of work, family and men that were held by students in the class of 1983 at Barnard, a women's college.         Reviewing that book in The New York Times Book Review, Adele Simmons, then president of Hampshire College in Amherst, Mass., wrote: ''The impact of the women's movement on higher education becomes apparent to even the most skeptical reader.'' She noted that Professor Komarovsky observed bleakly that, as Dr. Simmons put it, ''while attitudes have changed, institutions have not. The gains of the last decade, she warns, will only be secure when society develops permanent measures to support women in the workplace as well as in the home.''         In researching the book, Professor Komarovsky used interviews, questionnaires and surveys to study the attitudes of more than 200 students in the Barnard class of 1983. Fully two-thirds of those young women were afflicted with what she called ''culture shock'' that differed from student to student. As Dr. Simmons put it, ''Ideas about virginity, femininity, sexual preferences and study habits all came under scrutiny as students' friendships evolved and intellectual challenges arose.''         Professor Komarovsky found that 76 percent of the female students planned, at the time they entered Barnard, on combining career, marriage and children in the coming years. And by the time the class graduated, fully 85 percent of its members had come to have that threefold ambition.         Two observations of Professors Komarovsky's that Dr. Simmons found intriguing were her finding that the most highly career-minded students had mothers who had not worked and regretted it -- or mothers who worked and enjoyed it; and her suggestion that the young women sought a mixture of sensitivity, self-awareness and masculinity in men.         Professor Komarovsky also found that most of the women she surveyed found it hard to attain relationships that they considered satisfactory with men, although those women had had chances to interact with men from a variety of backgrounds.         Rather similarly, Professor Komarovsky wrote, on the New York Times Op-Ed page in 1981: ''Young women are becoming aware that the call to equal opportunities for women outside the home is an empty slogan as long as the society insists on traditional role segregation within the family. Some women react to this discovery with equanimity, others with frustration, resignation or indignation. But the real touchstone of their aspirations is the longing for a society in which the rhetoric of equality will be realized as fact. There is no denying that this would require major institutional changes.''         What to do? ''We have much to learn from Sweden,'' Professor Komarovsky wrote: ''Modified work patterns for both sexes, housing patterns permitting more-cooperative ties among child-rearing families, accessible child-care centers of high quality for all economic classes.''         Over the years, she also wrote about various aspects of sociology, including theory and methodology.         She was born in Baku, on the Caspian Sea, in what was then Russia, to Mendel Komarovsky and the former Anna Steinberg, and she was raised largely in Baku. When she was 17, she and her family emigrated to the United States. She attended a high school for a year in Wichita, Kan., where some members of her family lived, and went on to receive a bachelor's degree in 1926 from Barnard, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was taught by the anthropologists Ruth Benedict and Franz Boas.         Nonetheless, as the book ''Women in Sociology'' (1991, Greenwood), edited by Mary Jo Deegan, reports: ''Komarovsky was puzzled'' by Barnard's ''extolling intellectual excellence while discouraging women from pursuing careers.''         She received a master's degree in 1927 and a doctorate in 1940, both in sociology, and both from Columbia. Her doctoral thesis was published as a book, ''The Unemployed Man and His Family'' (1940).         Earlier, she was a co-author of the book ''Leisure: A Suburban Study'' (1934). In addition, before joining the Barnard faculty as an instructor in 1938, she taught at Skidmore College in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and was a research assistant at the Yale University Institute of Human Relations, at Columbia, and at the International Institute of Social Research in New York.         She was chairman of the sociology department at Barnard from 1949 to 1968 and was president of the Eastern Sociological Society in 1955 and 1956.         But she recalled years later that in the 1940's and even later, choosing women's issues to do research on was at a cost to her. The field lacked academic glamor and was not likely to further a career.         An early marriage, in 1926, ended in divorce in 1928. In 1940, she married Marcus A. Heyman, who died in 1970.         Her survivors include a sister, Dolly Cheser of Rockville Centre, L.I., and five nieces and one nephew.       
         Dr. Jan Hawkins, a pioneer in the use of computers and other technology in education, died Feb. 9 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 47 and lived in Cambridge, Mass., and on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Before joining the education faculty at Harvard University in September, Dr. Hawkins established her reputation through her work as director of the Center for Children and Technology, an agency founded in 1981 by the Bank Street College of Education in New York. Dr. Hawkins joined the group that year, long before computers had become an integral part of education.         ''She worked to find the mutual fit needed so technology could work in an educational setting,'' said Dr. Howard Gardner, a colleague of Dr. Hawkins's at Harvard. Dr. Hawkins was often called upon for help and advice by school districts, museums and other educational institutions looking for ways to integrate computers into their programs.         In her first studies during the early 1980's, she showed that children, especially girls, used computers in sociable and collaborative ways, not in isolation as critics had feared, said Dr. Margaret Honey, a longtime colleague of Dr. Hawkins's at the center.         In 1994, the Center for Children and Technology became a division of the Education Development Center, based in Newton, Mass. Dr. Hawkins became a vice president of that association, which, like the Center for Children and Technology, is a nonprofit research and development group financed by grants and contracts with foundations and government institutions.         Jan Hawkins was born in New Canaan, Conn., and received her bachelor's degree in psychology and English from Tufts University in 1973. She received a master's degree in psychology and a doctorate in developmental psychology from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in 1987.         She belonged to numerous boards and advisory groups in her field. She was an editor of professional journals and at Cambridge University Press, dealing with its ''Learning by Doing'' series.         Dr. Hawkins is survived by her parents, John and Francette Hawkins of Mountain View, Calif.; two sisters, Kim Hawkins of Cleveland and Cynthia Rahilly of Manhattan; a brother, John Hawkins of Virginia Beach, Va., and her fiance, Prof. Rand Spiro of East Lansing, Mich.       
         Gertrude B. Elion, a pioneer in drug research who shared a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1988, died on Sunday in Chapel Hill, N.C., where she lived. She was 81.         Ms. Elion developed drugs for use in a vast array of conditions. They included drugs for herpes, leukemia, malaria, gout, immune disorders, and AIDS, and immune suppressants to overcome rejection of donated organs in transplant surgery. In perfecting one compound after another, Ms. Elion worked for four decades with Dr. George H. Hitchings, who died a year ago.         Ms. Elion broke down sex barriers in the male-dominated world of scientific research, becoming one of the rare women to win a Nobel Prize and, even rarer, a scientist who did not have a doctorate.         Ms. Elion shared the Prize with Dr. Hitchings, who hired her as a $50-a-week assistant in 1944. Also sharing the Prize was Sir James Black of Britain, who discovered two classes of drugs, beta blockers, for high blood pressure and heart disease, and H-2 antagonists, for ulcers.         Seldom does the Nobel committee in Stockholm honor employees of pharmaceutical companies, but all three that year worked or had worked for such a company. Ms. Elion and Dr. Hitchings collaborated throughout their careers at the company known today as Glaxo Wellcome. In awarding the Prize to the three scientists, the Nobel committee said their work ''had a more fundamental significance than their discovery of individual drugs.''         Ms. Elion was noted for her precise work, intellectual brilliance and ability to work with others.         Few scientists matched the wide array of drugs that Ms. Elion and Dr. Hitchings developed. The drugs include acyclovir (Zovirax) for herpes; azathioprine (Imuran) to help prevent rejection of transplanted organs and in treatment of severe rheumatoid arthritis; allopurinol (Zyloprim) for gout; pyrimethamine (Daraprim) for malaria and trimethoprim (a component of Septra) for bacterial infections.         The two worked in lock step for much of their careers, but Dr. Hitchings was always one step ahead of Ms. Elion; as he moved into a new job, she filled the old one.         The two scientists wrote many papers together, sometimes with her name first, sometimes his. As Ms. Elion said, ''He had two arms of research and I was one of them.''         In 1991, President George Bush awarded Ms. Elion a National Medal of Science, saying her work had ''transformed the world.''         Gertrude Belle Elion was born in New York City on Jan. 23, 1918, and graduated with highest honors in chemistry from Hunter College in 1937. Ms. Elion decided to go into medical research as a teen-ager after her grandfather died of cancer and her father, a dentist and Lithuanian immigrant, encouraged her to develop a career. Her mother was from Russia.         But unable to find a laboratory position because she was a woman, Ms. Elion took a succession of jobs. First, she worked as a laboratory assistant in biochemistry. Then she worked as a food analyst, checking the acidity of pickles and making sure the berries slated for jam were not moldy. Next, she taught chemistry and physics in the New York City school system before earning a master's degree in chemistry at New York University in 1941.         After working for Johnson & Johnson for two years, Ms. Elion, helped by labor shortages in World War II, joined what was then Wellcome Research Laboratories, in Tuckahoe, N.Y., as a biochemist. Ms. Elion later became head of the company's experimental therapy department.         She retired in 1983, but continued working, helping to oversee work on the development of AZT as the first drug against H.I.V., the AIDS virus. Ms. Elion also served on the faculty of Duke University and the University of North Carolina.         While working for the drug company, Ms. Elion felt that her lack of a doctorate was a disadvantage, so she began a Ph.D. program at Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute. She took courses at night, commuting an hour and a half each way. But she eventually had to quit because she was told she would have to attend school full time to get a Ph.D., and she could not afford to give up her job.         When she gave her first scientific paper at a major meeting, she said she got into an argument with a distinguished scientist and stood her ground because ''I knew I was right.''         Ms. Elion never married. She was once engaged, but her fiance died of a heart infection. Ms. Elion said she would not have advanced in her career if she had chosen to marry and have children because women were not encouraged then to work while their children were young.       
         Bessie Cohen, who as a 19-year-old seamstress escaped the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. She was 107 and was one of the last two known survivors of the Manhattan fire, according to the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.         Her son, Jack Kosslyn, an acting teacher and casting director, said she died at the Jewish Home for the Aging in Los Angeles, where she had lived for the last 14 years. Until six weeks ago, he said, she had retained much of her vitality and memory.         Over the years, she had graphically recalled for her family, as well as for historians and documentary filmmakers, what she experienced and witnessed on March 25, 1911, when the worst factory fire in New York history raged through the top three floors of the 10-story Asch Building on the northwest corner of Washington Place and Greene Streets. Inside, about 500 women, mostly Jewish and Italian immigrants, worked behind locked doors making shirtwaists. Shirtwaists were blouses of lightweight fabric, depicted as the uniform of modern womanhood in the illustrations of Charles Dana Gibson.         It was a Saturday afternoon, and Mrs. Cohen, then still Bessie Gabrilowich, was on the ninth floor. She had come alone from Russia to New York two years earlier and had worked in several shops as a stitcher, saving money to bring her sisters to America. The workers were near the end of their 6-day, 52-hour workweek, and since one of the women on the ninth floor had just become engaged, someone had brought a cake, and slices were being passed around.         For the rest of her life, Bessie Cohen would remember that earlier in the day, she had urged her friend, Dora Abramowitz, who was 15, to ask the foreman to give her a 50-cent raise to bring her salary up to the $3 a week that Bessie was earning. At the moment that someone screamed fire, Bessie was teaching a dance step to a fellow worker. The flames were coming up from the cutting room on the floor below.         Within the next 15 minutes, nearly 30 percent of all the Triangle Shirtwaist workers were killed. Mrs. Cohen would later tell her children that after the warning, she went to look for the cheap straw hat she had bought the day before, when she heard a foreman shout to her in Yiddish, ''Bessie, save yourself.'' She looked across the room and could see her friend Dora, looking frightened. But when she looked again, Dora was gone. She was one of those who jumped from the windows and died.         The fire trucks' ladders could reach only to the seventh floor. Firefighters held nets below, but so many women were jumping at the same time that the nets tore and did not hold them. Some rushed to the elevator shaft, hoping to escape by sliding down the cables, only to lose their grip. Most of those who lost their lives had worked on the ninth floor.         Later inquiries found that doors leading from the shop areas had been locked, presumably to keep the women at their sewing machines. The owners, who were tried for manslaughter, were acquitted when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were locked. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families.         On the day of the fire, Mrs. Cohen would recall, she somehow found her way to a staircase and covered her face with her purse as she ran to the street.         The next day, she returned to the street outside the building, where the bodies were arrayed so that friends and relatives might identify them. A newspaper photographer took a picture of her as she collapsed at the sight; Mr. Kosslyn said his mother kept that newspaper picture throughout her life.         She took other jobs, he said, and became active in the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, whose organizing efforts gained momentum after the fire. Two years before the blaze, a three-month strike of about 20,000 shirtwaist workers in New York City and Philadelphia had helped to entrench the union and had focused public attention on conditions in sweatshops. The needletrades union is a successor to the International Ladies Garment Workers.         At least one survivor of the fire is still living, according to The Associated Press. Rose Freedman, 105, of Beverly Hills, Calif., escaped by fleeing to the roof, her family said.         The Triangle Shirtwaist fire has become the most vivid symbol of the struggle for workplace safety. As outrage mounted after the fire, the union intensified its demands for safer working conditions. A huge crowd of sympathizers, Mrs. Cohen among them, paraded in mourning to the arch in Washington Square Park. Hearings were held, and by the end of 1911, the city of New York had established a Bureau of Fire Investigation, headed by the future Senator, Robert F. Wagner, who was later the father of the Wagner Labor Act. The bureau had the power to impose and enforce safety regulations.         The Asch Building, its interior long since gutted and rebuilt, became a part of New York University and still stands.         In 1915, Bessie married and moved with her husband, Lewis Cohen, to New London, Conn., where her son and daughter were born. For many years after the fire, her son said, she would react fearfully to thunder and lightning, burying her head in her arms and sobbing.         The family moved to Passaic, N.J., and then to New York. In 1940, after her marriage ended, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son was living. Mrs. Cohen, an independent woman, lived on her own until she was 93 in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, staying on after most of the Jewish residents had left.         When she was 89, she was mugged and had her jaw fractured by two men who took her purse, which contained a bus pass and 60 cents.         After two weeks, she returned to her home and neighbors, sipping liquids through her wired jaw for months. When she finally did leave for the nursing home, about 200 of her neighbors, almost all of them Hispanic, saluted her with a festive street party.         She is survived by her son, Jack, of Los Angeles, and a daughter, Sylvia Scott of Calistoga, Calif. A grandson, Jan Tangen, died last year.       
         Sarah Kane, a provocative playwright whose bleak view of the limitations of human relationships and graphic dramatizations of violence and sex earned her a reputation as an enfant terrible of the British theater, died on Saturday at King's College Hospital here. She was 28.         She was found hanged in her room at the hospital, where she was being treated for depression, friends said. The police said they considered the case a suicide.         Ms. Kane exploded onto the London theater scene at 23 with her nihilistic first play, ''Blasted,'' a precocious debut that shocked critics and brought her tabloid denunciations as a promoter of depravity. The play depicted a rampaging soldier raping another man and then gouging out his eyes, eating his tongue and forcing him to cannibalize a dead baby.         No play or playwright had caused such outrage since Edward Bond had an infant being stoned to death in a baby carriage in his play ''Saved'' 30 years earlier on the same Royal Court stage. The theater, which has had a policy of presenting bold new playwrights since its 1956 success with John Osborne's groundbreaking  ''Look Back in Anger,'' stuck by Ms. Kane and staged two of the three other plays she was to write in her short, high-profile career.         One of them, last May's ''Cleansed,'' brought forth a fresh cascade of negative comment with scenes that included the injection of heroin into an eyeball, a savage amputation and a rape with a broom handle. Her other works were  ''Phaedra's Love,'' an adaptation of Seneca, produced at the Gate in 1996,  and ''Crave,'' which opened at last year's Fringe Festival in Edinburgh before moving on to the Royal Court.         Early performances of ''Crave'' listed a pseudonymous author, an effort on her part to free the play from the unwanted celebrity that ''Blasted'' had brought her. She said she had been wounded by the bad publicity, and according to a newspaper account, confided to a friend that ''the only good journalist is a dead journalist.''         While the dominant view of her work was typified by The Daily  Mail's verdict that ''Blasted'' was ''a disgusting feast of filth,'' there were critics who found courage and honesty in her work. One classed her tormented visions as ''the bleached language of truth and poetry'' depicting a world in which love and violence are intertwined.         Reviewing ''Cleansed,'' Benedict Nightingale of The Times of London wrote: ''She is not the gloating opportunist that some reviewers of 'Blasted' thought. She has no less integrity than Pinter or Bond, but, God knows, I would hate to live in her head.''         In contrast to the ferocity of her words, in person she was a pale, thin, soft-spoken presence, living alone in Brixton in South London and writing feverishly in the early morning hours instead of sleeping. She spoke of her moments of mental affliction with a grim appreciation, saying:  ''Many people feel depression is about emptiness, but actually it's about being so full that everything cancels itself out. You can't have faith without doubt, and what are you left with when you can't have love without hate?''         The daughter of a journalist, Ms. Kane grew up in Brentwood in suburban Essex County, east of London, in a household that went through an obsessive Christian redemption process during her youth. At 17 she turned her back on religion, saying that her family's experience was ''a spirit-filled, born-again lunacy.''         To critics of her dramas' dependence on savagery, she said: ''The reading I did in my formative years was the incredible violence of the Bible. It was full of rape, mutilation, war and pestilence.''         She was drawn to theater as a teen-ager, directing school productions of Chekhov's ''Bear'' and Joan Littlewood's ''Oh, What a Lovely War!'' She went on to Bristol University, where she graduated with honors in drama, and to Birmingham University, where she got a master's degree in playwriting.         She was a writer in residence at the experimental company Paines Plough, working with emerging writers at the urging of her friend and fellow playwright Mark Ravenhill, the author of ''Shopping and . . .,'' which played at the New York Theater Workshop last year. She ran workshops in Bulgaria and Spain with the Royal Court International summer school, and her plays were produced by a number of continental companies.         ''People in Britain never realized the extent of her fame throughout Europe,'' said Michael Billington, the  drama critic of The Guardian. ''Wherever I went, I found an extraordinary curiosity about her work and what it said about contemporary Britain.''         Mr. Ravenhill said that Ms. Kane ''talked about suicide all the time -- so much so that it became a joke.'' Her last play ''Crave,'' ends with a suicide, and, interviewed about the play recently, Ms. Kane said: ''Some people seem to find release at the end of it, but I think it's only the release of death. In my other plays it was the release of deciding to go on living despite the fact that it's terrible.''       
         Virginia Foster Durr, a well-born civil rights campaigner who was on hand when Rosa Parks was bailed out of jail where she was being held for not giving up her seat on a bus to a white man in 1955, died on Wednesday at a nursing home in Carlisle, Pa. She was 95.         Mrs. Durr and her husband, Clifford, a lawyer, were New Deal veterans who were in the thick of the civil rights movement in their native Alabama in the 1950's and 1960's.         President Clinton said, in a statement: ''A white woman, born to privilege in the Deep South, Mrs. Durr refused to turn a blind eye to racism and intolerance in our society. Her courage and steely conviction in the earliest days of the civil rights movement helped to change this nation forever.''         In 1955 Mrs. Durr and her husband helped a black civil rights leader, E. D. Nixon, bail Mrs. Parks, a black seamstress active in the N.A.A.C.P., out of jail in Montgomery, Ala., said Dr. Patricia Sullivan, a historian and fellow at the W. E. B. Du Bois Institute of Afro-American Research at Harvard University.         Mrs. Parks's action touched off the Montgomery bus boycott by blacks, which helped spur the civil rights movement and brought the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to prominence.         Mrs. Parks said in a letter to the Durr family: ''I will miss you, old soldier, but the rich legacy you have passed to your children, grandchildren and great-grands lives on. We still have a long ways to go, but you, my friend, have made it easier for all of us.''         A native of Birmingham, Ala., Virginia Foster was reared there in the traditions of the Old South. She was a debutante, was prominent in the local Junior League and attended Wellesley College.         She moved to Washington in the 1930's, when Mr. Durr was on the staff of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. In the Washington of the 1930's, many New Deal Young Turks clustered around the couple. Her personal liberalism found expression in those years, and she was a founding member of the interracial Southern Conference for Human Welfare, which opposed segregation.         Mrs. Durr also helped Eleanor Roosevelt generate support for legislation to end the poll tax, which helped prevent many Southerners from voting. In 1948 she was an unsuccessful candidate of Henry A. Wallace's Progressive Party for the Senate from Virginia.         Three years later the Durrs moved to Montgomery, where they supported the bus boycott and other civil rights activities. In 1954 she was summoned before the Senate's Internal Security Subcommittee after being accused of harboring Communist sympathies. She testified that she did not belong to the Communist Party and had not attended any party meetings.         As Rosellen Brown, a novelist, has put it, ''While the majority of Alabamians considered Virginia and Clifford Durr traitors, not heroes, they represented to many of us the best of the white South, its native strength: they were sensible, outspoken, committed and only accidentally heroic.''         Mrs. Durr won applause for her autobiography, ''Outside the Magic Circle'' (University of Alabama, 1985)'' edited by Hollinger F. Barnard. Dr. Sullivan is also editing a  book of Mrs. Durr's letters.         The Durrs were married in 1926. Mr. Durr died in 1975.         Mrs. Durr is survived by four daughters, Ann Durr Lyon of Harrisburg, Pa., Lucy Durr Hackney of Philadelphia, Virginia Foster Durr of Sweden, Me., and Lulah Durr Colan of Milwaukee; 11 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Molly Harrower, a clinical psychologist who devised a Rorschach test for use in group therapy, died Feb. 20 at her home in Gainesville, Fla. She was 93.         Dr. Harrower developed her own set of inkblot cards to administer to groups of Canadian military recruits in World War II. Known as the Harrower Blots, the tests were used to help analyze personality traits through a subject's interpretation of a standard series of inkblot designs.         She also refined diagnostic tests to measure tolerance for stress.         With Dawn Bowers, she edited ''The Inside Story: Self-Evaluations Reflecting Basic Rorschach Types'' (Erlbaum, 1987.)         Among her other titles were ''Appraising Personality'' (1952), ''Personality Change and Development'' (1958), ''The Practice of Clinical Psychology'' (1962), ''Psychodiagnostic Testing: An Empirical Approach'' (1965) and ''The Psychologist at Work'' (revised edition, 1971). She also wrote ''The Therapy of Poetry'' in 1974 and contributed to ''The Quest for the Nazi Personality: A Psychological Investigation of Nazi War Criminals.''         Dr. Harrower, a native of South Africa, was educated in England and graduated with a degree in psychology from the University of London in 1928. She briefly studied dance and painting in France but was persuaded to continue her education on a fellowship at Smith College with the theorist Kurt Koffka, a founder of Gestalt theory.         Working for Koffka, she obtained her Ph.D. at Smith in 1934. The association prompted her book ''Kurt Koffka: An Unwitting Self-Portrait,'' reprinted in 1983.         Over the years, she was in private practice in New York, worked as a psychologist for Federal agencies and taught at universities in various parts of the country before moving to the University of Florida in 1968. She retired in the mid-1970's.         Her husband, Mortimer Lahm, died in 1967.       
         Marion Boyars, an independent publisher whose eclectic and internationally minded list of authors included at least four Nobel Prize winners, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 71.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, her family said.         In an industry increasingly populated by conglomerates with deep pockets and a penchant for books that appeal to as wide an audience as possible, Mrs. Boyars was rare in her insistence on publishing only what she liked, whether the book was likely to sell or not. ''Most of my publishing is out of enthusiasm,'' she told The New York Times in 1995.         Over the years, often working on a shoestring and struggling to stay afloat, she published some 500 books by such writers as Eudora Welty, Julio Cortazar, Yevgeny Yevtushenko, Georges Bataille, Tim O'Brien, Pauline Kael and Ingmar Bergman,  works translated from more than 20 languages. Among the Nobel Prize winners on her list were Heinrich Boll, Elias Canetti, Kenzaburo Oe and Eugenio Montale.         She was born Marion Asmus in New York, and grew up there and in Switzerland. After graduating from Keele University in Staffordshire with a degree in politics, philosophy and economics, she married George Lobbenburg, an American who ran a successful clothing company in Britain. The couple had two daughters.         Divorced in her early 30's, she answered an advertisement in The Bookseller, a London trade magazine, and ended up buying a 50 percent stake in a firm run by the independent publisher John Calder. The two set up business in London under the name Calder & Boyars, publishing works by such authors as Samuel Beckett, Marguerite Duras, Henry Miller, Eugene Ionesco and William S. Burroughs. They also specialized in the writings of modern composers, publishing works by Cage, Ives and Stravinsky, and social commentators including Ivan Illich and Robert Heilbroner.         In an international cause celebre, the company was brought to court here and charged with obscenity in 1966 after publishing ''Last Exit to Brooklyn'' by Hubert Selby Jr. It lost the original case in the Old Bailey but won on appeal two years later after a successful argument by a young John Mortimer.         But Mrs. Boyars, who by then had married her second husband, Arthur Boyars, fell out with her business partner. Taking along the firm's big money-maker, Ken Kesey's ''One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest,'' among other things, she eventually set up Marion Boyars Publishers, with offices in London and on East 39th Street in Manhattan.         She published about 25 new books a year, becoming a fixture at the annual Frankfurt Book Fair and  mining world literature for anything worthy of publication in English.         Mrs. Boyars formed close friendships with many of her authors. When Michael Ondaatje -- who by then was published by another company -- won the Booker Prize for ''The English Patient'' in 1992, he publicly thanked her for helping to start his career.         She is survived by Mr. Boyars and her two daughters, Susan Quateman of Beverly, Mass., and Catheryn Kilgarriss of London, who is now managing her publishing house.         Correction:  February 11, 1999, Thursday  An obituary last Thursday about Marion Boyars, an independent publisher with offices in London and New York, misspelled the surname of her first husband. He was George Lobbenberg, not Lobbenburg. The obituary also misspelled the surname of one of her daughters. She is Catheryn Kilgarriff, not Kilgarriss.       
         Indrani, a distinguished dancer who familiarized Americans with several styles of India's classical dance as a performer and teacher, died on Friday in Beekman Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Sukanya Wicks, said.         Indrani was an artist of international repute and often appeared before heads of state in her native India and abroad. But she also became a highly respected figure in the dance world of New York after her debut there in 1960. The hallmark of her dancing, a blend of dramatic vibrancy and technical refinement, carried over to her teaching at American colleges and festivals.         Although she had a home in New Delhi until recently, she spent most of the last two decades in the United States, where she toured extensively. In 1961, Indrani was the first dancer presented on a national tour by the Asia Society. She had been on the faculty of the Juilliard School since 1976.         ''Indrani was an exquisite dancer, a great teacher and a true rasika, in the largest spirit of that word, meaning a lover of the arts,'' Rachel Cooper of the Asia Society said yesterday. Ms. Cooper, associate director of the society's performing arts and public programs, also praised Indrani's role as a producer of concerts in New York by younger Indian dancers. She said the society had planned to give Indrani a lifetime achievement award. ''The event will now be a memorial as well,'' Ms. Cooper said.         Unlike many Indian dancers of her generation, Indrani did not specialize in a single school of classical dance but studied with leading gurus in India to master the contrasting styles of Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam and Orissi.         In the 1950's, Indrani was the first professional dancer to perform Orissi onstage; Orissi, then a neglected dance form, was inspired by temple sculpture in the state of Orissa, in eastern India. Indrani was instrumental in the revival of Orissi, introducing it to audiences in India by touring widely there and doing the same abroad when she performed as a soloist or with her ensemble of musicians and dancers.         In championing rarely seen or forgotten classical dance forms, Indrani followed naturally in the footsteps of her mother, Ragini Devi, an American-born dancer who was internationally known for her leading role in the revival of classical dance in India in the 1930's.         As Esther Sherman in Petoskey, Mich., the future Ragini Devi was already in love with Indian dance when she met Ramlal Bajpai in Minneapolis. After she married Bajpai, an Indian scientist and activist for Indian independence, she traveled to India to study dance in 1930. Their daughter, Indrani, was born that year in Madras. In her book ''Dance Dialects of India,'' Ragini Devi described how she would take the infant Indrani on her own visits to gurus. As a dancer, Indrani was her  ''alter ego,'' Ragini Devi wrote. ''Her dance career is a continuation of mine.''         Ragini Devi, who died in 1982, made her last stage appearance at a memorable concert in 1979 at New York University. She was joined by Sukanya, Indrani's daughter and also a dancer, as well as Indrani. The vivacity of all three generations came into play.         Indrani's playfulness and gaiety at that performance were typical of her vivid personality. In the dramatic Kuchipudi solos, Indrani's quick shifts in characterization were always subtle and deep.         Having started at age 5 in her mother's company, she was steeped in the content of classical dance. As a professional, she began with Bharata Natyam, where she could display the rhythmic complexity of her footwork. But mime within this style and in others allowed her to exhibit her brilliant dramatic gifts.         The Indian Government sponsored Indrani's tours. Her warmth and artistry, as well as the beauty of her costumes and presentations, made her a perfect choice. In 1961 she performed for President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during Nehru's official visit to Washington. Indrani received the Indian Government's national award, Padma Shri, and the Sangeet Natak Akadami Award in the performing arts.         Indrani married Habib Rahman, who was named India's chief architect and who died in 1995. In addition to her daughter, of Orr's Island, Me., she is survived by her son, Ram Rahman, of New Delhi, and two grandsons, Wardreath Wicks of Orr's Island, and Habib Wicks of New York City.       
         Iris Murdoch, a prodigiously inventive and idiosyncratic British writer whose 26 novels offered lively plots, complex characters and intellectual speculation, died yesterday at a nursing home in Oxford, England. She was 79 and had Alzheimer's disease.         Her struggle with Alzheimer's was documented recently in ''Elegy for Iris,'' a memoir by her husband, the critic and novelist John Bayley, who was at her bedside when she died.         Miss Murdoch's first novel was published in 1954 and in a career that lasted for more than four decades, her fiction received many honors, including the Booker Prize for ''The Sea, the Sea,'' the Whitbread Literary Award for Fiction for ''The Sacred and Profane Love Machine'' and the James Tait Black Memorial Prize for ''The Black Prince.'' Although she was made a Dame of the British Empire, she rarely garnered the attention given to gaudier contemporaries. She spent much of her career quietly teaching and writing, away from lecture tours, prize committees and television appearances.         Along with novels, she produced a half a dozen works on philosophy, several plays, critical writing on literature and modern ideas and poetry.         Miss Murdoch had a background in philosophy -- she knew and wrote about Jean-Paul Sartre, studied with Ludwig Wittgenstein and was a lecturer in philosophy at Oxford University -- and her fiction grappled with such questions as the nature of good and evil. This led many who knew her work superficially to assume that her novels were philosophical explorations of the origins of morality and behavior and too esoteric or intellectually rigorous for a general audience.         In fact, many of Miss Murdoch's novels are exuberantly melodramatic, offering bemused records of romantic or erotic follies, as well as more somber battles between individuals representing moral good and its opposite. Her characters, drawn largely from the middle class, are described with loving exactitude and in such depth that their struggles to define what it means to live a good life take on dramatic force.         In Books, Happiness And Moral Lessons         Far from viewing fiction as another and lesser way of dealing with philosophical questions, Miss Murdoch argued that literature was meant ''to be grasped by enjoyment,'' and that the art of the tale was ''a fundamental form of thought'' in its own right. The ideal reader, she told one interviewer, was ''someone who likes a jolly good yarn and enjoys thinking about the book as well, about the moral issues.'' In another interview she went further, asserting that good art offers ''uncontaminated'' happiness that also teaches ''how to look at the world and to understand it; it makes everything far more interesting.''         Her belief in literature had its inception in her happy and book-filled childhood. Jean Iris Murdoch was born in Dublin on July 15, 1919, the only child of British and Irish parents. When she was a year old her family moved to London, where her father, Wills John Hughes Murdoch, joined the civil service. In interviews she remembered that as a child she had existed ''in a perfect trinity of love.'' Her mother, the former Irene Alice Richardson, who had trained as an opera singer, was a ''beautiful, lively, witty woman with a happy temperament.''         Her father began discussing books with her early on and encouraged her to read widely. She progressed rapidly from Lewis Carroll (one of her favorites) and Robert Louis Stevenson to more adult fare. Her great pleasure in reading, and her early attempts to write stories led to the conviction, which she formed as a child, that she would become a writer.         She attended boarding school in Bristol, and in 1938 entered Somerville College, a women's college at Oxford, where she studied the classics, ancient history and philosophy. She graduated with honors in 1942 and immediately took a job with the Treasury. In 1944 she began working for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, which helped Europeans displaced by World War II. The somber experiences of the war had a profound impact on her thinking. Close friends died while in service, and her work, often on the front lines, with poor and elderly refugees was hard but instructive.         If her childhood had been mostly idyllic, there was, she later noted, at  least one shadow falling across her memories of those years: her family members were largely ''wanderers,'' cut off from their Irish relations and their roots. Working with refugees led her to reflect further on the place of the exile in modern society, as well as on the sources of evil, raising questions that she would pursue in many novels.         After leaving the United Nations, Miss Murdoch took up further study in philosophy at Cambridge University, where she worked with Wittgenstein. While she expressed no lasting allegiance to his school of thought, she said her studies with him  spurred her development as a writer.         In 1948 she became a fellow and tutor at St. Anne's College at Oxford, where she remained for 15 years as a lecturer in philosophy. It was a particularly heady time for anyone concerned with the study and application of philosophical thought; new schools of philosophy were contending for primacy and often combative works were being produced to define these emerging disciplines.         Miss Murdoch had met Sartre, the most visible proponent of existentialism, while working with refugees in  Belgium. Existentialism, with its focus on individual will, appealed to her, but she found its emphasis on the primacy of the self disturbing.  Her first published work, ''Sartre: Romantic Rationalist'' (1953), was a serious, clear explanation of existentialism and its place in contemporary thought. While it was balanced, it was not uncritical: Miss Murdoch felt that existentialism encouraged an almost hermetic focus on the self, ignoring the corrosive implications of such a perspective on society.         Her study paid special attention to Sartre's fiction. She had already written and discarded several novels, but now she had become absorbed with how fiction expressed ideas and the ways fiction and ideas could best be blended. ''Under the Net,'' her first published novel, appeared to generally positive reviews. It focused on the picaresque adventures of a free-spirited Irishman making the rounds of some of the more raffish areas of London and Paris. A reviewer in The Times Literary Supplement said the work seemed to announce the emergence of ''a brilliant talent.''         The novel signaled the beginning of an industrious and prolific career.  Miss Murdoch published, on average, a novel every two years for the next four decades. Her work, while varied in setting and tone, rarely moved far from several central preoccupations and themes.         She first encountered existentialist writings while working with refugees, and she drew deeply from her fascination with those experiences in  her second novel, ''Flight From the Enchanter'' (1956). It concerns the  well-intentioned, conventionally liberal Rose Keep, who attempts to offer solace to two Polish brothers, refugees from the war. Her efforts founder because she cannot see the brothers as something more than symbols of displaced, wounded humanity.         Revisiting Themes Of Pure Love         The double-edged nature of love figures often in Miss Murdoch's fiction. True love, she asserted in the essay ''The Sublime and the Good,'' was perhaps the best way to overcome isolation and the absorption with one's crippled and constricted self. ''Love is the extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real,'' she argued.         Many of the figures in her fourth novel, ''The Bell'' (1958), are crippled by their inability to clearly see, and thus to truly love, those around them. ''The Bell'' reached a new level of sophistication for Miss Murdoch, displaying elements that would  become hallmarks of her fiction: effortless shifting between the grim and the humorous; deft marshaling of a large, varied cast of characters and numerous subplots, and creation of fables or myths that could suggest the struggle between true and diminished forms of love.         In many of Miss Murdoch's novels, romantic disasters, suicides and even murder are set in motion by a character who is brilliant and ferociously self-absorbed. Such figures, usually men, often go beyond egotism into evil.         In ''A Fairly Honorable Defeat'' (1970), a biologist who helps create biological weapons sets out to destroy those around him. But goodness, Miss Murdoch suggests, while imperiled, is also resilient.         In ''The Sacred and Profane Love Machine'' (1974), the only character who comes close to true altruism is destroyed. But the novel suggests that her death may have opened the  hearts of those around her to a better, more responsible life.         ''The Sea, the Sea'' (1978), which received the Booker Prize, is considered one of Miss Murdoch's best novels. Its protagonist, a retired theatrical director trying to win back his first love, is not so much evil as simply self-absorbed and dangerously certain of his limited view of the world.         ''A Severed Head'' (1961) was a black farce about infidelity, incest and violence.         Storytelling And Large Truths         Miss Murdoch was always balancing the demands of storytelling with the more urgent need to examine how the truth of a fleeting life reflected the larger, permanent truths of  existence.         ''The Red and the Green'' charts the fates of two friends who find themselves on opposite sides during Ireland's 1916 Easter rebellion against British rule.         ''The Nice and the Good'' follows  the efforts of a decent man to uncover the reasons for a colleague's suicide and extricate himself from the seamy web of blackmail and the occult that he uncovers.         ''Italian Girl'' traces the struggle of a young man to liberate himself from the corrosive effects of family secrets and a shallow, destructive image of love.         The tension generated by this iconoclastic approach to fiction has made Murdoch's novels unique and controversial. Her fiction takes a distinctive vigor and texture from its combination of the usual elements of a tale with a sustained, sophisticated inquiry into such concepts as the defining characteristics of goodness, the nature of morality, the place of faith in everyday life and the conflict between spiritual and carnal love.         When most other writers were content to dwell on the heated specifics of individual lives or to simply offer a catalogue of society's ills, Miss Murdoch dared to suggest that fiction should be a means of dealing with life's largest and most basic issues and a way to learn about moral behavior.         This quest ''for a passion beyond any center of self,'' as David Bromwich wrote in The New York Times Book Review, made her fiction unlike that of any other contemporary Western writer. It also let her in for  both considerable acclaim and criticism. Harold Bloom, while praising her ''formidable combination of intellectual drive and storytelling exuberance'' in a review of her novel ''The Good Apprentice'' in The Times, and noting her ''mastery'' in ''representing the maelstrom of falling in love,'' also found that her narrative voice often lacked authority, ''being too qualified and fussy.''         Anthony Burgess, while noting the highly original ''synthesis of the traditional and revolutionary'' in her work and praising her talent for creating stories that were ''both thoroughly realistic yet at the same time loaded with symbols,'' also argued in his 1967 book ''The Novel Now'' that her characters were too often ''caught up in a purely intellectual  pattern.'' In a memorable phrase, he contended that, while Miss Murdoch had a rare ability ''to dredge that world of the strange and mysterious'' that rested ''on the boundary of the ordinary,'' her work rarely offered a convincing portrait of the more common realms of life.         In a body of work so large, both admirers and critics were bound to find material to advance their arguments, and this was true as well in her later novels, such as ''The Message to the Planet'' (1989) and ''The Green Knight'' (1994).         But neither criticism nor praise seemed much to affect her. She said that she never read her reviews. She rarely read modern writers, preferring the British and European novelists of the 19th century (Jane Austen,  Charles Dickens, George Eliot, Henry James, Tolstoy and Dostoyevsky), with whom she felt an affinity, describing them as ''moralistic writers who portray the complexity of morality and the difficulty of being good.''         She lived for many years in the small village of Steeple Aston, near  Oxford, in a house crowded with books and paintings. The quiet life there, and in the house in Oxford to which she moved in 1986, has been described memorably by her husband, an Oxford don, in ''Elegy for Iris,'' his memoir of their lives together.         John Bayley fell in love with Iris Murdoch when he was in his late 20's and she was in her early 30's; she passed his window on a bicycle. ''I indulged the momentary fantasy that nothing had ever happened to her; that she was simply bicycling about, waiting for me to arrive,'' he wrote. ''She was not a woman with a past or an unknown present.'' They were married in 1956; he is her only close survivor.         The novelist Mary Gordon, reviewing ''Elegy for Iris'' in The Times, touched on their relationship. ''Radical privacy, sealing compartments of her life off from each other, was always a condition of Iris Murdoch's selfhood, and anyone who married her had to deal with that. From the beginning, she had friendships that she kept from Bayley, and love affairs that he was meant to understand had nothing to do with him. There are some hints that this was not always easy, but Bayley rose to the challenge.'' Ms. Gordon then quotes Mr. Bayley's memoir: ''In early days, I always thought it would be vulgar -- as well as not my place -- to give any indications of jealousy, but she knew when it was there, and she soothed it just by being the self she always was with me, which I soon knew to be wholly and entirely different from any way that she was with other people.''         Slipping Into A Baffling Darkness         In 1995 Miss Murdoch told an interviewer that she was experiencing severe writer's block, noting that the struggle to write had left her in ''a  hard, dark place.'' In 1996, Mr. Bayley announced that she had Alzheimer's disease, which she had suffered for five years by the time she died. Her final three weeks were spent in a nursing home. If ''Elegy for Iris'' offers a moving evocation of a great love story, it also provides a grim record of watching the personality of a loved one gradually dwindle under the burden of fear, bafflement and grief.         She was, Miss Murdoch confided to one of her friends, ''sailing into the darkness.'' Mr. Bayley's descriptions of his struggle to understand his wife's suffering, to find ways to ameliorate it and to come to grips with the physical demands of his new responsibilities and to understand the conflicting emotions aroused in him by the experience are exact, penetrating and unsparing. Miss Murdoch became like ''a very nice 3-year-old,'' her husband said, and she needed to be fed, bathed and changed.         The note on which the book concludes, however, is one of reconciliation, and of a painfully won serenity. ''Every day,'' Mr. Bayley wrote of their lives together in Miss Murdoch's last years, ''we are physically closer. . . . She is not sailing into the dark. The voyage is over, and under the dark escort of Alzheimer's, she has arrived somewhere. So have I.''       
         Pearl Bernstein Max, who played a central role in melding the New York City municipal colleges into today's City University of New York, died Thursday in her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 94.         In 1938, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed Mrs. Max -- known as Pearl Bernstein for much of her career -- as the first administrative director of New York City's Board of Higher Education. That job, the chief administrator, was a predecessor of the office of Chancellor in the current system.         Mrs. Max helped lay much of the groundwork for fitting City, Hunter, Brooklyn and Queens Colleges into CUNY, as it came into being in 1961. She drafted the first master plan and the financing formula for the system and served as liaison to its Administrative Council of College Presidents.         She was the founding coordinator of CUNY's Office of Institutional Research in 1967. From there, she initiated pioneering studies of teacher education, admissions procedures and other issues of vital importance to the growing university.         Thus, Mrs. Max was one of the principal shapers of CUNY, the nation's largest municipal university system. It now comprises 11 senior colleges, 6 community colleges, a graduate division, a law school, a medical school and an affiliated school of medicine. It has nearly 200,000 students working toward degrees and 155,000 adult and continuing education students throughout the five boroughs.         Mrs. Max also served as secretary and administrative head of the New York City Employees Retirement System, one of the country's largest pension funds. She taught courses on state and local government at Barnard College, and retired from CUNY in 1969.         A native of Manhattan, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard in 1925 and pursued postgraduate studies at Columbia University and Fordham Law School. She joined the League of Women Voters of New York City in 1926 as its municipal representative and the group's first paid executive.         The league monitored the policies and procedures of the city's Board of Estimates and Apportionment. Her reputation for clear and evenhanded analyses drew the attention of Mayor La Guardia, who named her secretary of the board in 1934.         She was the first woman in that post, which she held until the Mayor moved her to the Board of Higher Education. Over the years she served as an officer of the Women's Club of New York, Ethical Culture Schools, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, New York Metropolitan Council and American Society of Public Administrators, among other organizations.         Her husband, Dr. Louis W. Max, died four years ago after 66 years of marriage. Mrs. Max is survived by a daughter, Dr. Claire Max of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Dr. Betty Bernstein of Manhattan and Hilda Morris of Huntington, N.Y.; two brothers, Ira Bernstein of Fairfield, Conn., and Seymour Bernstein of Manhattan, and one grandson.       
         Vivian Hallinan, the striking matriarch of one of San Francisco's best-known and most colorful political families, died on Tuesday at a granddaughter's home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 88.         Mrs. Hallinan, the widow of Vincent Hallinan, a fiery socialist lawyer who died in 1995, made a multi-million-dollar fortune by buying apartment buildings during the Great Depression.         ''She didn't trust the stock market, so she didn't get wiped out, and had money to buy buildings real cheap,'' said Shane Hallinan, the granddaughter at whose home Mrs. Hallinan died.         Her profits financed her political causes, which included leftist movements like the Sandinistas in Nicaragua. ''She was aware of the contradiction,'' Shane Hallinan said. ''But she believed she was able to do something to better the world with the money she made.''         A native San Franciscan, Mrs. Hallinan was born Oct. 21, 1910, to Ed Moore and Katherine Lagomarsino Moore. After her parents' brief marriage ended, she was reared by her mother, whose maiden name she adopted, and by a series of immigrant Italian relatives. She attended the University of California at Berkeley.         After her marriage in 1932 to Mr. Hallinan Mrs. Hallinan reared six sons. She wrote about the experience in ''My Wild Irish Rogues'' (Doubleday & Company, 1952).         Politics was her passion as much as parenting, however. She helped her husband with his campaign in 1952 as the Presidential candidate of the Progressive Party. She also held the family together when he spent six months in jail in the 1950's for contempt of court, in connection with his support of the labor organizer Harry Bridges, who was accused of being a Communist Party member.         Mrs. Hallinan, elegant and chestnut-haired, served 30 days for participating in the 1964 civil rights demonstrations in San Francisco. She was also tear-gassed once, in Chile in the early 1980's.         ''She found the experience in jail heartening,'' Shane Hallinan said. ''She was used to being judged by her movie-star looks or her money, and here she was with just all these other women. The other stuff didn't matter, and she liked that.''         With her during that civil rights demonstration were all of her sons, including Terence Hallinan, now the district attorney for San Francisco.  ''Everyone was there except my father, who stayed outside with the bail money,'' said Patrick Hallinan of Kentfield, Calif.         Besides Terence and Patrick, Mrs. Hallinan is survived by three other sons: Matthew, Daniel and Conn, all of Berkeley, and 16 grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Huckaby, who as a vice principal shepherded nine black students through the tumultuous integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957, died on March 18 in Little Rock.         Mrs. Huckaby, whose memoir, ''Crisis at Central High,'' inspired a 1981 television movie recounting the landmark civil rights confrontation, was 93.         In September 1957, Mrs. Huckaby was about to enter her 28th year at Central High. A native of Hamburg, Ark., the daughter of a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of the University of Arkansas, she was accustomed to the ways of the South. As she remembered it, ''I had never known any black well, except those in household employ.''         Soon, she would be trying to shield the first black students at Central High from intimidation by white students.         As an outgrowth of the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision, the Little Rock school board admitted nine blacks to Central High for the 1957-58 school year. But Gov. Orval E. Faubus called out the National Guard to prevent their entry. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock and placed the Arkansas guardsmen under Federal control to insure the black students' admission in the face of mob action.         On one occasion, 50 boys gathered atop the stairs at the school's entrance when no troops were in sight and shouted racial epithets at the blacks as they approached.         Melba Pattillo Beals, in her memoir, ''Warriors Don't Cry'' (Pocket Books, 1994), recalled what happened as she and other black students were about to retreat:         ''Vice Principal Huckaby made her presence known at the bottom of the stairs. Tiny, erect, and determined, she stood there all alone between us and our attackers, demanding they leave us alone. One by one she challenged the leaders, calling them by name, telling them to get to class or there would be hell to pay. Whether or not she favored integration, she had a heck of a lot of guts.''         The best-remembered image of the Little Rock events is a photograph showing a white girl, her face contorted in rage, screaming at Elizabeth Eckford, a black girl entering the school.         Mrs. Huckaby, the vice principal for girls and an English teacher, took the white student to her office.         ''I told her, hatred destroys the people who hate,'' Mrs. Huckaby recalled. ''She shrugged. Well, that was the way she felt, she said. Wasted breath.''         Mrs. Huckaby later persuaded Miss Eckford to remain in school after she came to her office in tears over continuing harassment.         The tensions took their toll on Mrs. Huckaby, who testified at a June 1958 court hearing: ''I would lie awake at night wondering what I could do. I had no social life at all because on weekends I was too tired. I would go out to the country and just sit.''         Eight of the nine black students remained through the school year, and at commencement ceremonies on May 27, 1958, Ernest Green became the first black graduate of Central High. Mrs. Huckaby stayed at the school until retiring in 1969. ''Crisis at Central High'' (Louisiana State University Press, 1980), based on journals she had kept during the confrontation, was made into a CBS movie that brought Joanne Woodward an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Mrs. Huckaby.         Mrs. Huckaby is survived by a sister, Clara Doyle, of Danville, Calif., and a brother, Clifton Paisley, of Tallahassee, Fla.         Mrs. Huckaby, who did not consider herself a social crusader, would recall having told Daisy Bates of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Arkansas that ''since my field was education, my immediate goal was having the black children in school as just ordinary children.''         She supported school integration, believing, she said, that ''no public school system segregated by law on the basis of race is consistent with democracy.''       
         Dr. Hildegard Elizabeth Peplau, a nursing educator who played a major role in developing the theory and practice of psychiatric and mental health nursing, died on March 17 at her home in Sherman Oaks, Calif. She was 89.         Dr. Peplau wrote a seminal text, ''Interpersonal Relations in Nursing: A Conceptual Frame of Reference for Psychodynamic Nursing,''  which was completed in 1948 and published in 1952. It was translated into several languages and left an impact in much of the world.         She introduced the concept of nurse-patient relationship, an interpersonal approach that has since been integrated into nursing education and practice. With this, she was considered a force in elevating nursing to a profession.         Colleagues regarded Dr. Peplau as the ''mother of psychiatric nursing,'' said Dr. Grayce M. Sills, professor emeritus at the Ohio State University College of Nursing and a fellow of the American Academy of Nursing.         Referring to the general acceptance of Dr. Peplau's interpersonal process, Dr. Sills added, ''It has been argued that Dr. Peplau's life and work produced the greatest changes in nursing practice since Florence Nightingale.''         Dr. Peplau's book was also deemed highly unusual at the time because it had been written by a nurse, without a physician as a co-author. Its English version remains in print with a 1991 edition from Springer.         Dr. Peplau was born in Reading, Pa., and witnessed the deadly influenza epidemic of 1918, which defined her understanding of the impact of illness and death on families.         She graduated from Pottstown Hospital School of Nursing in 1931 and from Bennington College in 1942. She served in the Army Nurse Corps as a first lieutenant in World War II and received a master's degree from Columbia University in 1947 and a doctorate in education in 1953.         She studied psychology for a certificate from the William Alanson White Institute (1953), and that study inspired her to adapt the interpersonal approach for the nursing profession.         Dr. Peplau directed the graduate program of psychiatric nursing at Columbia Teachers College from 1948 to 1953 and its counterpart at Rutgers University after that. She retired from Rutgers as a professor emeritus in 1974.         She lectured worldwide and wrote articles for many publications. She was also executive director and president of the American Nurses Association, which inducted her into its Hall of Fame last year, and was a board member of the International Council of Nurses, which honored her with its highest award, the Christiane Reimann Prize, in 1997.         Dr. Peplau is survived by a sister, Bertha Reppert, of Mechanicsburg, Pa., and a foster brother, John D. Forster, of Reading.       
         Her hair is boyishly cropped, her clothes are casual, and while riding her bike around Cape Cod she could pass as a college freshman.         But Dr. Lene Vestergaard Hau is no freshman. A teacher at Harvard University and an accomplished experimenter, she has gained a formidable reputation in a branch of science traditionally dominated by men: physics.         Most of all, she is known as the scientist who slowed light down to a walk.         Dr. Lene (pronounced LEE-nuh) Hau, at 39, is rapidly reaching the top of her profession, her colleagues agree. On Feb. 18 the prestigious scientific journal Nature selected for its cover article a paper of which she was the leading author, and it caused a mild sensation.         In their paper, Dr. Hau, with Dr. Steve E. Harris of Stanford University and two of Dr. Hau's Harvard students, reported the results of their experiment in which a beam of laser light was slowed to the astonishingly low speed of 38 miles an hour. (By comparison, light in a vacuum travels about 186,000 miles per second.)         Dr. Hau's laboratory at the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge (where she conducts research with the help of her graduate and post-doctoral students from Harvard) ) is one of a handful of organizations studying the interactions of lasers with a very peculiar kind of matter called a Bose-Einstein condensate.         It was by shining precisely tuned lasers on such a condensate, or cloud, of ultra-cold sodium atoms that Dr. Hau and her team reduced the speed of a light beam to a pace slower than her bicycle.         The achievement, noted by many newspapers, magazines and broadcasters, was a tour de force of pure physics, and it may also herald great practical applications.         Among them could be the development of optical switches that could enormously improve the performance of computers.         Dr. Hau presides over a half million dollars' worth of apparatus at the Rowland Institute, a research organization founded by the late Edwin H. Land, the inventor of Polaroid instant photography, to support innovative research. Unmarried, Dr. Hau lives near the laboratory and spends most of her time either at the laboratory or pondering the problems her next experiment will present.         ''I find that the shower is a very good place to think things out,'' she said, ''but sometimes I forget what I'm doing. Once I even stepped into the shower with my clothes on.''         Although increasing numbers of women have entered the sciences in recent years, their participation in physics remains very limited. Of several hundred scientists attending a typical physics meeting, only a half dozen or so are likely to be women. Dr. Hau is often asked how she came to be one of them.         ''For one thing,'' she said, ''I was lucky to be a Dane. Denmark has a long scientific tradition that included the great Niels Bohr, one of the founders of quantum theory.         In Denmark, physics is widely respected by laymen as well as scientists, and laymen contribute to physics. For instance, research in quantum mechanics has been supported in Denmark by the makers of Carlsberg beer since the 1920's. I myself was supported as a graduate student for one year by a Carlsberg scholarship.''         Dr. Hau was born in Vejle, a small town not far from the University of Aarhus, on the east coast of Jutland.         ''Neither of my parents had any background in science,'' she said. ''My father was in the heating business and my mother worked in a store. But both of them believed in giving me the same advantages as my brother, which was very important to my education.''         A prodigy who skipped 10th grade, she was immediately accepted at a ''gymnasium,'' a European upper school roughly equivalent to the first two years of college in the United States.         From childhood Dr. Hau was fascinated by mathematics, especially geometry. ''All my life I have needed to visualize things, even abstractions. Without a visualization in my head I'm lost, and geometry is very visual.''         This approach to physics works, she said, even for visualizing mathematical abstractions like Hilbert spaces (named for David Hilbert, a German mathematician), which combine a variety of physical states (or ''wave functions'') into a single mathematical entity.         ''When I first entered Arhus University,'' Dr. Hau recalled, ''I was bored by physics. They just taught us thermodynamics and classical mechanics, and that bored me. But I loved mathematics. I would rather do mathematics than go to the movies in those days.         ''But after a while I discovered quantum mechanics, and that got me interested in physics again, and I've been hooked ever since.''         Quantum mechanics is a system of probabalistic rules governing the discontinuous jumps in behavior of very small particles of matter and energy. Transistors and many other electronic devices work according to these rules.         Dr. Hau was awarded her Ph.D. from the University of Arhus in 1991 after completing a dissertation on the ''channeling'' of electrons along strings of atoms in a silicon crystal, as if the atomic strings were miniature wave guides, like the optical fibers used to guide light.         Along the way she acquired a working knowledge of English, German and French. French proved to be vital to her work during seven months of research she conducted at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva.         ''The scientific papers were written in English, but the meetings announcing the availability of various particle beams were all in French, and without French I would have been lost,'' Dr. Hau said.         ''I loved it at CERN. The people were really passionate about their work. Even at 3 in the morning you would always see people in the labs.''         In 1988, while completing her Ph.D. work, Dr. Hau made her first trip to the United States, looking for a post-doctoral job. By then she had received a one-year stipend from Carlsberg so she could accept a post-doctoral university appointment without pay. Among the scientists she met was Dr. Jene A. Golovchenko, a physicist at Harvard, who also worked at the Rowland Institute.         ''I told Jene what I had been doing and also that I wanted a complete change in direction. I wanted to work on cooling atoms,'' she said. ''He told me he didn't know anything about cooling atoms but said we could work together on it, so I was given a post-doctoral appointment. Later, the Rowland Institute gave me a staff job and my own laboratory.''         Although she is a permanent United States resident, Dr. Hau has not applied for citizenship.         ''I would like to be a citizen so I could vote,'' she said, ''but I would have to give up Danish citizenship, and that would make me feel disloyal. Last week the Danish comedian and pianist Victor Borge performed in Boston for two straight hours -- and it was hilarious -- even though he is 90 years old. Now there's a Dane for you, one to make you feel proud.''         Although much of Dr. Hau's work is done on a blackboard, she is also a ''dirty hands'' physicist who builds and adjusts much of her own complex apparatus.         In 1994, she and Dr. Golovchenko designed and built an ingenious atomic beam source called the ''candlestick,'' which is now a part of Dr. Lau's light-slowing apparatus. The device incorporates a ''wick'' made of gold-plated stainless-steel cloth, which soaks up hot molten sodium metal and wicks the sodium up to a heater that vaporizes it. A jet of hot sodium atoms then shoots out of a pinhole into the cooling apparatus that chills them to a tiny fraction of a degree above absolute zero.         An atom at room temperature moves at high speed, but when it is bombarded from three directions by laser beams it loses energy and slows down: it cools off. In a complicated series of stages, Dr. Hau's apparatus uses lasers to cool the sodium atoms part way, and then evaporates the fastest (and therefore hottest) of them, saving the coolest in the trap. At the end of this cooling operation (which takes 38 seconds), the cloud of atoms in the trap has been reduced to only 50 one-billionths of a degree above absolute zero, a temperature far colder than any in nature, even in the depths of space.         Because of the Uncertainty Principle -- one of the fundamental rules of quantum mechanics -- the more precisely the momentum (or velocity) of a particle is known, the less precisely is it possible to measure its position, and vice versa. At exactly zero degrees (which in practice could never be reached), a particle would have zero momentum, a precise value. This would mean that the particle's position would be highly uncertain; it might be found anywhere within a large volume of possible places.         The volume occupied by each ultra-cold sodium atom in Dr. Hau's trap expands enormously, so much so that atoms in the trap are forced to overlap and merge into what physicists call a Bose-Einstein condensate (named for the theorists Satyendra Nath Bose and Albert Einstein), in which the atoms' quantum wave functions are combined.         Once the condensate is created, a ''coupling'' laser tuned to resonate with the trapped mass of atoms is beamed into the trap chamber so that the atoms and photons of light become ''entangled'' with each other, behaving as if they were a single entity. A pulsed laser probe is then shot into the ''laser dressed'' condensate from a different direction, and some of its light passes through, but at a speed 20 million times as slow as the speed of light in a vacuum.         A table covered with a labyrinth of little mirrors guides a network of beams requiring perfect adjustment, and Dr. Hau and her team work long and tedious hours, sometimes around the clock. Their eyes become strained from exposure to the glaring yellow laser spots reflected from the apparatus.         ''Of course, we have to eat while we work, and we like pepperoni pizza, but we have to be careful to keep the optical system clean,'' she said. ''Each cooling cycle for the sodium atoms takes 38 seconds, and that gives us just enough time to take a bite of pizza, change hands and flip up one of the mirrors in the optical system to prepare for the next cooling cycle. It takes some practice.''         Dr. Hau is considering an experiment to measure localized wave functions in the cooled atom trap, allowing her to explore the structure of the condensate.         ''Some people think it might be dangerous, that the trap might explode. But the most worthwhile physics is often a bit dangerous,'' she said.         ''When you're looking at the computer monitor and you suddenly see what you had hoped you would find,'' she added, ''it's the greatest feeling in the world.''         SCIENTIST AT WORK: LENE VESTERGAARD HAU       
         Harriet M. Waddy, one of the two highest-ranking black officers in the Women's Army Corps in World War II and its wartime adviser on racial issues, died on Feb. 21 in Las Vegas, Nev. She was 94.         In April 1943, First Officer Harriet West, as Harriet Waddy was then known, made a radio broadcast on behalf of the Army, urging black women to get into uniform.         She said that joining the segregated military ''and accepting a situation which does not represent an ideal of democracy'' was not ''a retreat from our fight'' but ''our contribution to its realization.''         The 6,500 black women who joined the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, created in 1942, and the organization that succeeded it a year later, the Women's Army Corps, joined an institution in which segregation was the official policy. Many were used as uniformed domestic servants, assigned to cleaning officers' clubs. Harriet West tried to ease their distress after she was promoted to major and named an aide to the WAC director, Col. Oveta Culp Hobby.         Major West and Maj. Charity Adams, who commanded the only unit of black Wacs sent overseas in World War II, were the only two black women to attain the rank of major in the wartime WAC.         ''Harriet was charming,'' Charity Adams Earley recalled last week from her home in Dayton, Ohio. ''She looked good, and she was well-disciplined, as we were all trained to be.''         Major West's composure must have been sorely tested when she was dispatched to the South to hear the grievances of black Wacs.         Lula Jones Garrett, a reporter for The Philadelphia Afro-American, who accompanied Major West on a trip from Atlanta to Fort McClellan in Anniston, Ala., in 1944, wrote how Major West ''had been insulted by a white conductor whom she had asked to hand her baggage from the train.''         Major West fought racially insulting Army decrees. On a visit to Wacs at Fort Des Moines, Iowa, she recommended that ''all reference to white and colored personnel be completely eliminated'' from official memorandums on information boards. She said that would bring ''less embarrassment to the colored personnel'' and a ''feeling that a forward step has been made toward democracy.''         Service in the wartime military, in her view, would help blacks gain acceptance. She said that military service would give black women a chance to ''show their ability'' and be ''of future benefit to the whole race.''         Harriet M. Hardin was born in Jefferson City, Mo., on June 20, 1904, and brought up by a grandmother after her mother died. A graduate of Kansas State University, she worked during the Depression as an aide to Mary McLeod Bethune, the director of the National Youth Administration's Division of Negro Affairs and later a civilian adviser to the WAC.         She entered the WAC officer candidate school at Fort Des Moines in 1942. She was promoted to lieutenant colonel in 1948 and retired from the armed forces in 1952. Then she worked for the Federal Aviation Administration and counseled troubled girls at a Job Corps center in Oregon.         A longtime resident of Eugene, Ore., Mrs. Waddy moved to Las Vegas in 1998 to live with a friend, Barbara Connolly, when her health declined. She was married four times but left no immediate survivors. In the war years, she was married to Dr. Charles West, a physician. She and her fourth husband, Maj. Edward Waddy, were divorced.         Another friend, Marie Marshall of Eugene, recalled how Mrs. Waddy was still bowling and driving a car into her 90's. Mrs. Marshall viewed her as a strong and independent woman who said, ''The Frank Sinatra song 'My Way' was just perfect.''       
         Helen Priest Rogers, an authority on dance notation, a co-founder of the Dance Notation Bureau and a pioneer in the use of film to preserve choreography, died on Mar. 2 at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Brattleboro, Vt. She was 85 and lived in West Brattleboro.         Ms. Rogers, who studied modern dance with Martha Graham and performed with the Graham company in 1935, went to Germany in 1936 at Graham's suggestion to learn the new system of Labanotation.         In 1940 she, Eve Gentry, Janey Price and Ann Hutchinson founded the Dance Notation Bureau in New York. It remains one of the world's most important centers for notation research.         Ms. Rogers also believed in recording choreography on film. She made her first dance films at the  Bennington Dance Festivals of the 1930's. After World War II, she taught notation for the American Dance Festival when it was at Connecticut College in New London. From its first season there in 1948 until 1976, when Ms. Rogers turned over her project to other cinematographers, she supervised the filming of 75 productions, including works by  Graham, Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor.         Ms. Rogers, who was married to the Canadian artist Hubert Reginald Rogers, was born in Ogdensburg, N.Y., and attended St. Lawrence University and Columbia University.         She taught dance and notation at various colleges and directed the dance program at Mount Holyoke College from 1953 to 1975.         She is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Scott of Whately, Mass.; a son, Norman Rogers of West Brattleboro; a stepdaughter, Jean Rogers of Provincetown, Mass; a sister, Alice Dunn of Big Arm, Mont.; a brother, Dorman Priest of Amherst, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Lila Hotz Luce Tyng, the first wife of Henry R. Luce, founder of Time Inc., died on Wednesday at her home in Gladstone, N.J., five days after her 100th birthday.         Mrs. Tyng, the mother of Mr. Luce's children, was a leading figure in New York's social and philanthropic circles for several decades.         Though overshadowed in history by the editor's famous second wife, the author Clare Boothe Luce, Mrs. Tyng played an important role in the life of Mr. Luce, who sought her advice even after they were divorced, said Robert E. Herzstein, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina and the author of ''Henry R. Luce'' (Scribner, 1994).         Lila Hotz was born in Chicago in 1899, the daughter of Robert Schuttler Hotz, an inventor and financier, and Lila Ross Hotz. On New Year's Eve 1919, she met the young Luce through one of his Yale classmates, Thornton Wilder; they were married in 1923.         The young wife hoped that Time's growing success would eventually allow her workaholic husband to join her in the kind of social whirl she loved. But they divorced in 1935, not long after Mr. Luce met Clare Boothe, whose literary and journalistic drives and interests better matched his own. ''Lila was devastated when Luce confronted her with his intention to divorce her,'' Dr. Herzstein said. ''But they maintained a closeness and were in constant contact, often discussing their children's education and careers, among other things.''         Mrs. Tyng and Mr. Luce, who died in 1967, had two sons: Henry Luce 3d,  chairman and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation in New York City, and Peter Paul Luce of Englewood, Colo.         In 1939, she married Sewell Tappan Tyng, a lawyer, author, head of a mining company and assistant to the New York City District Attorney, Thomas E. Dewey. She became a fixture in New York society, serving on the boards of several institutions,  including the Henry Street Settlement, the Berkshire Farm School, the Spence-Chapin Adoption Service  and the Grosvenor Neighborhood House. She once reported attending 36 balls in 36 weeks.         Besides her two sons, Mrs. Tyng is survived by six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Edith Anderson, an American writer who defied postwar ruin and harsh political realities to resettle in divided Berlin with her German Communist husband and lived just long enough to see her cold war memoir published and praised as a literary event, died on Tuesday at her home in Berlin. She was 83.         Ms. Anderson, whose last name was originally Handelsman, had returned to Berlin on April 7 after two weeks in New York to promote her new book, ''Love in Exile,'' published in March by Steerforth Press of South Royalton, Vt.         The product of decades of reminiscences, journalism and correspondence, the book traces Ms. Anderson's odyssey from a conservative Jewish upbringing in the Bronx, to a stint at the Communist newspaper Daily Worker, to encounters with Richard Wright, Simone de Beauvoir, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym and other literati. She also wrote of her consuming romance with Max Schroeder, a surrealist poet, editor and antifascist whom she married and followed from his wartime exile in New York back to Soviet-controlled East Germany in 1947.         ''Love in Exile'' has been hailed by Grace Paley, Doris Lessing and Vivian Gornick, among other writers, as a sharp and gripping portrait of an ideological and human landscape as foreign to today's Americans as the dark side of the moon. A review in The New York Times Book Review  found the book most affecting when Ms. Anderson recounted her domestic anguish and search for love outside the marriage.         In an early section, she described how she landed her job at The Daily Worker in 1942, when she was 26.         ''Hastening down Broadway to my Marxist analyst who charged only $5 a session because I was unemployed (he too was still young) I bumped into a former college crony named Milton. He hailed me joyously. 'You're just the person I need!' He told me he was cultural editor of The Daily Worker but had just been drafted into the Army and must find a replacement by the weekend.''         She was overwhelmed. She would scrub floors at The Daily Worker. But she had no newspaper experience. She wrote:         '' 'I'll break you in,' he said.         '' 'In three days?         '' 'Less.' ''         She asked herself how she had the nerve to pass herself off as cultural editor. ''My analyst brushed these scruples aside. He was delighted that I had a real challenge to bite into; life, as Marx said, was a struggle and I was no more a fraud than anyone else.''         Still, she was soon dismissed and ended up as one of the women on train crews hired to replace men called to war. Shortly afterward, she met Mr. Schroeder, a craggy and mesmerizing onetime bohemian 17 years her senior. He had escaped from Nazi captivity in Vichy, France, and was editing an anti-fascist publication in New York.         After he returned to Germany in 1946, she followed the next year, via Paris, after almost joining the American Army in a desperate effort to enter restricted Berlin at a time when almost everyone there would have given anything to get out. She was to remain, with only intermittent visits home, for the next 52 years, although her husband died in 1958. They had a daughter, Cordelia, who still lives in Berlin.         In ''Love in Exile,'' Ms. Anderson said that as a widow she considered returning to the United States with her daughter but was deterred by the imagined voice of Max: ''What right have you to deprive her of the Socialism for which so many people died or went into exile? It may be imperfect but something can be made of it.'' The book ends in 1962.         Although clearly enamored of Marxism since youth, Ms. Anderson was not overtly political, said her childhood friend, the writer Helen Yglesias, a classmate at James Monroe High School in the Bronx. ''She was highly sympathetic to Max's idealism and his hope that a just society could be built,'' she said.         But she was a sharp and often corrosive chronicler of the death throes of the German Democratic Republic as Communism collapsed and the Berlin Wall fell in 1989: ''a kaleidoscope rolling downhill,'' as she described it.         In an account of the final days, later included in an anthology, ''Without Force or Lies'' (1990), she wrote of traveling through East Germany in a train compartment with her grandson and watching a young man and woman, strangers, suddenly shed their inhibitions and take up the taboo subject of politics.         The man, agitated, ripped off his tie, warning that East Germans  ''had just about had it,'' she wrote.         '' 'I give it one more year before something busts,' he said.         '' 'Six months,' she replied.''         Her grandson grew alarmed and Ms. Anderson sought to calm him. ''But I felt my own scalp creep, as if some law of nature had had broken, a sheep instead of baaing shouted in a human voice, 'Enough!'         ''The young woman had hit it right on the nose: six months. The unthinkable happened here.''         At the same time, Ms. Anderson also wrote acidly of the former West Germans ''tramping around'' the prostrate east, flooding it with inferior ''Western goods.''         Edith Handelsman grew up on Hoe Avenue in the Bronx and graduated in 1937 from New College, a division of Teachers College at Columbia University. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a brother, John Bernard Handelsman of Hampton Bays, N.Y., a cartoonist at The New Yorker, and a grandson.         Besides her memoir, Ms. Anderson also wrote ''Gelbes Licht'' (''Yellow Light'') in 1956 about her railroad work, and short stories, children's books and radio plays. A play, ''Wo Ist Katalin? (''Where Is Katalin?''), was produced in Weimar in 1977. From 1960 to 1977 she was the Berlin correspondent for The New York National Guardian.         Mr. Handelsman said that on her recent book-promotion visit to New York, his sister seemed confused and forgetful, possibly presaging her fatal stroke.         But Ms. Anderson's literary agent, Malaga Baldi of Manhattan, said any infirmities disappeared at a reading the author gave at the New School for Social Research on March 25.         ''She started to read an excerpt,'' Ms. Baldi said, ''but the people would not let her stop.''       
         Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild, a patron of Martha Graham and of modern dance in Israel, died on Tuesday at her home in Tel Aviv. She was 84.         The granddaughter of Baron James de Rothschild, the founder of the French branch of the Rothschild banking family, Baroness de Rothschild became a supporter of Graham after seeing performances by her and her company in New York in the early 1940's. She bought the house on East 63d Street in Manhattan that was the company's headquarters for many years and supported the Graham school and its activities.         Baroness de Rothschild began her professional life as a research biologist at a laboratory in Paris. She came to the United States at the start of World War II, studied chemistry and biology at Columbia University and worked in an industrial laboratory.         During the war she worked for the Free French movement in New York and London. She enlisted in the French Army and landed in Normandy after the Allied invasion. She was a liaison between the French and United States forces in Paris, returning to New York at the end of the war.         In her quiet way, Baroness de Rothschild intrigued the Graham dancers, who knew her as Bethsabee, the French version of her first name.         ''For all I know, the tour being my first, wardrobe mistresses are always baronesses,'' Paul Taylor wrote in his autobiography, ''Private Domain.'' ''Bethsabee supervises the laundering and packing of our costumes with quiet efficiency, almost as if born to it, and by looking at her own outfits, you can't tell she's an heiress -- that is, if you don't know that expensive dresses are sometimes the dumpiest.''         Besides supervising the wardrobe, Baroness de Rothschild was involved in a wide range of company activities, including taking a few dance classes with Graham and buying the dancers jewelry one Christmas at a lavish party she gave for the troupe.         Baroness de Rothschild founded the Batsheva de Rothschild Foundation for Arts and Sciences in the early 1950's in New York. The foundation's first project, in 1953, was to sponsor a two-week festival of American modern dance on Broadway. In addition to underwriting Graham tours, the foundation also helped establish the Juilliard Dance Theater, directed by Doris Humphrey, and sponsored a second three-week festival of modern dance on Broadway.         One of the Baroness's greatest contributions to modern dance was the founding of the Graham-based Batsheva Dance Company in 1964 in Tel Aviv. Baroness de Rothschild, who had moved to Israel two years earlier, believed the country needed a professional modern dance company with full-scale sets and costumes and thorough training. She sent several dancers to New York to work with Graham, who agreed to be Batsheva's artistic adviser, and Graham sent dancers to Israel to work with the new company.         Internationally known choreographers like Jerome Robbins and Jose Limon went to work with Batsheva, and the troupe toured extensively in the United States, Europe and Asia. Baroness de Rothschild went on to form a second, more balletically based group, the Bat-Dor Dance Company, in 1967. She withdrew her support from Batsheva in 1974 after the company refused to hire as its director Jeannette Ordman, her protegee and the head of Bat-Dor.         Though she never became an Israeli citizen, she remained immensely loyal to the nation, working as a driver after her car was mobilized during the 1973 war. She supported many Israeli causes through her foundation, giving money to hundreds of emigre scientists and providing housing for new arrivals and loans to the poor in Tel Aviv.         She supported the establishment of the Center for Dance Medicine, the Chamber Music Association, the Chamber Ensemble and the Batsheva Crafts Corporation. She also established the Batsheva Foundation for the Advancement of Science in Israel, an endowed fund of the Israel Academy for Science and Humanities. She was the author of a French book on modern dance, ''La Danse Artistique aux U.S.A.''         Baroness de Rothschild is survived by a brother, Guy, of Paris, and a sister, Jacqueline Piatigorsky of Los Angeles.         She received the Israel Prize in 1989 and was honored in 1997 at a celebration of the 30th anniversary of the Bat-Dor Dance Company at the new Tel Aviv House. Those paying tribute included Roni Milo, the Mayor of Tel Aviv, and the choreographers Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor.         Throughout her life the Baroness fascinated people with her innocent grandeur. Graham long remembered an exchange she had with the baroness after they visited the august Rothschild Bank in Paris.         ''It was unlike any bank I had ever seen,'' Graham wrote in her autobiography ''Blood Memory.'' ''No real tellers, no depositors that I could see.         '' 'Bethsabee, where are the depositors?'         '' 'Depositors?'         ''Bethsabee had evidently never been asked that question before.         '' 'We don't really encourage depositors, but yes, we do have one now . . . the Pope.' ''         Correction:  April 23, 1999, Friday  An obituary of Baroness Batsheva de Rothschild yesterday misstated her relationship to Baron James de Rothschild. She was his great-granddaughter, not his granddaughter.       
         Dr. Rose Payne, whose research into tissue compatibility at Stanford University over more than three decades helped advance the field of organ transplants, died on April 18 at Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Santa Clara, Calif. She was 89 and had been living in Cupertino, Calif.         Dr. Payne, an expert in tissue-typing, was credited with helping identify proteins that play an important role in how well patients accept a graft of tissue, or a blood transfusion, from another person. The proteins, part of the human leukocyte antigen system, may also lend insights into why some people are more susceptible than others to a range of autoimmune diseases, including diabetes and arthritis.         Before the work of Dr. Payne and other scientists who studied the proteins, doctors who transplanted organs had to base their determination of compatibility only on whether the donor and recipient had the same blood type.         Rose Payne was born on Aug. 5, 1909, in Lake Bay, Wash. She attended the University of Washington, where in 1937 she earned a doctorate in bacteriology.         She was hired by Stanford as a research assistant after World War II, one of the few women there at the time. A new career began when Dr. Payne, in her mid-40's, was encouraged by a new administration to pursue her own studies.         She began focusing on leukocytes, trying to establish what caused incompatibility problems.         In 1972, Stanford named Dr. Payne a professor of medicine. Three years later, her status changed again, to professor emerita.         In 1984, the American Society for Histocompatibility and Immunogenetics named an award in her honor.         In an interview posted on the society's Web site, Dr. Payne recalled what led up to her appointment as professor.         ''I had never asked for anything,'' she said. ''Then, one day, I decided I was old enough and established enough. So I marched right in and asked.''         Dr. Payne, who is survived by a sister, Violet Russell of Seattle, and a nephew, said that, in the end, the appointment did not change her life. ''I already had an international reputation and had done what I wanted to do.''       
         Melba Liston, a trombonist and arranger who worked with some of the best bands in jazz, died on Friday after a series of strokes, said a friend, the pianist Randy Weston. She was 73 and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Liston is best known for her collaborations with Mr. Weston, including the ambitious African-influenced works ''High Life'' and ''Uhuru Afrika'' from the early 1960's. On those albums she created dense harmonies to place over the percussion that Mr. Weston was using. She made his pieces, often harmonically simple, thick with dissonances and meaning.         Ms. Liston stopped playing in 1985 after a stroke left her partially paralyzed, but she continued to arrange music with Mr. Weston. Their collaboration continued into the 1990's, and included work on Mr. Weston's ''Spirits of Our Ancestors'' (1992) and ''Volcano Blues'' (1993).         Ms. Liston came to prominence in jazz in 1943, when she joined the arranger and composer Gerald Wilson's band in Los Angeles. She recorded with the tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon in 1947 (he dedicated the tune ''Mischievous Lady'' to her) and a year later she began working with Dizzy Gillespie and his orchestra. In 1957 she took what might be her most famous improvisation on record, on Gillespie's ''Cool Breeze,'' from ''Dizzy Gillespie at Newport.''         A few years earlier she had dropped out of music, working in clerical jobs and as a film extra. She had small parts in ''The Prodigal''and ''The 10 Commandments.''         When she returned to music she worked with Gillespie and with Quincy Jones, who was the music director of the television show ''Free and Easy.'' In the 1960's she worked with Mr. Weston, and during the 1970's she taught in Jamaica at the University of the West Indies and the Jamaica Institute of Music. She returned to the United States in the early 1980's.         Her later work for Mr. Weston is as dramatic as her early pieces, and on ''Volcano Blues'' she produces some shocking orchestral colors. At one of Mr. Weston's concerts at the Brooklyn Academy of Music last year, her presence brought the audience to its feet.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Lucille Lortel, whose pioneering efforts to bring innovative theater and adventurous new playwrights and actors to the American stage earned her the title Queen of Off Broadway, died on Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 and had homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         Among the legacies of Miss Lortel's cutting-edge career, which spanned more than 70 years, is the theater that bears her name in Greenwich Village; the still thriving White Barn Theater that she started in Westport in 1947; the Lucille Lortel Room at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, and the funds and fellowships she established to aid the arts. She also leaves a veritable Who's Who of people in international theater -- playwrights, actors, directors, composers and designers -- whose careers were advanced by her daring and her confidence in young talent.         ''If you love the theater you must be innovative,'' she once said. ''You must try new ideas and new faces. That's the only way theater can develop. You can't do it on Broadway because it costs too much. The costs are lower Off Broadway, so you can afford to take a chance, and you must take a chance.''         Forsaking the Footlights For a Backstage Role         Miss Lortel gave up a career as an actress in 1939 in deference to her wealthy husband's wishes and in 1947 began an experimental summer theater for American and foreign plays and playwrights in the barn of the couple's summer estate in Westport. From the start she wanted White Barn, as she called it, to be a sanctuary from commercial pressures, a place where writers could take a chance with their plays and where actors could stretch their talents. It was there that Miss Lortel staged readings, mothered performers like Eva Marie Saint, Geoffrey Holder and Zero Mostel and presented plays by Samuel Beckett, Edward Albee, Eugene Ionesco and Sean O'Casey.         In 1955 her husband, Louis Schweitzer, gave her a Manhattan theater, now known as the Lucille Lortel Theater, as a 24th wedding anniversary gift. The first production in the house, at 121 Christopher Street, then called the Theater de Lys, was Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ''Threepenny Opera. '' It caused such a sensation that the production ran for seven years and put Off Broadway on the map.         As Stuart W. Little observed in his 1972 book ''Off Broadway: The Prophetic Theater'': ''For thousands of theatergoers, a visit to the de Lys was the authentic Off Broadway experience. Off Broadway meant the discovery of new talent and fresh theatrical experiences in unfamiliar parts of the city. . . .The de Lys at the far end of Christopher Street, near the Hudson River docks, was situated in a borderline neighborhood between the known residential part of the city and the open seaport. The unknown world beyond, in imagination, merged with the pulsing underworld life of 'The Threepenny Opera' and became sinister, exotic, menacing.''         Miss Lortel was frustrated by the success of ''Threepenny Opera'' because she wanted to bring more plays into her theater, so she  persuaded the American National Theater and Academy to support a matinee series as a ''laboratory for innovation.'' The series ran for 20 years and became a legend. A verse adaptation of Alan Paton's novel ''Cry the Beloved Country'' became the first venture of the series in 1956, followed that  season by such groundbreaking productions as Anna Sokolow's Kafkaesque dance-drama ''Metamorphosis'' and May O'Donnell's modern-dance interpretation of Maeterlinck's play ''Pelleas and Melisandre.''         Over the years the series offered ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' a dramatization of Langston Hughes poems with Godfrey Cambridge; adaptations of poetic works by Robert Frost, Archibald MacLeish, W. H. Auden and Conrad Aiken; performances of rarely seen plays by O'Casey, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Albee and William Inge, and presented actors like Richard Burton in ''An Afternoon of Poetry,'' Siobhan McKenna as Hamlet, Helen Hayes in an anthology of Shakespeare and Dame Sybil Thorndike and Sir Lewis Casson in a joint dramatic reading. Terrence McNally and Adrienne Kennedy were among the new writers whose works were presented.         She brought Jean Genet to the attention of American audiences with a production of ''The Balcony,'' which she co-produced at Circle in the Square in 1960. She also oversaw the first American production of a play by Athol Fugard, the South African playwright; it was ''Blood Knot,'' starring James Earl Jones and J. D. Cannon, and it ignited audiences at the Cricket Theater on Second Avenue in 1964. She introduced many plays by Beckett, including ''Rockaby,'' on Theater Row on West 42d Street.         Creating a Setting For Cutting-Edge Work         At the Theater de Lys, she provided a home for such plays as David Mamet's ''A Life in the Theater,'' Sam Shepard's ''Buried Child'' and ''Getting Out,'' early work by Marsha Norman, Caryl Churchill's ''Cloud Nine'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic.'' The house was renamed the Lucille Lortel Theater in 1981, and has been the setting for Larry Kramer's ''The Destiny of Me,'' for ''Groucho'' and for ''Gertrude Stein and a Companion,'' the recipient of the National Education Film and Video Award for historical biographies.         The 38th volume of John Willis's ''Theater World'' (1981-82) is dedicated ''To Lucille Lortel, whose vibrant spirit and untiring efforts have made immeasurable contributions to all components of the theater by discovering and encouraging new talent, and whose devotion to Off Broadway provided the impetus for its proliferation.''         In 1960 Miss Lortel began sponsoring dramatic productions and seminars at the Library of Congress. The presentations included O'Casey's ''Time to Go,'' Mark Van Doren's ''Last Days of Lincoln'' and Albee's ''Fam and Yam.''         Miss Lortel produced or co-produced some 500 plays, 5 of which were nominated for Tony Awards -- ''As Is'' by William M. Hoffman, ''Angels Fall'' by Lanford Wilson, ''Blood Knot'' by Mr. Fugard, ''Sarafina!,'' an import from South Africa, and ''A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing. Several were produced in Broadway theaters and the others moved to Broadway.         The theater on Christopher Street was only one of many unusual gifts that Mr. Schweitzer lavished on Miss Lortel before his death in 1971. A chemical engineer who made his fortune manufacturing cigarette papers, he also owned the FM radio station WBAI.         In 1957, when his wife told him it was sometimes difficult to find a cab after the theater, he bought a gray Mercedes-Benz. He had been told there was a cab driver named Louis Schweitzer in town and he arranged to get a taxi medallion for the car and for his namesake to act as its part-time driver. When the driver wasn't transporting  Miss Lortel, he was free to use the car as a taxi and split the earnings with the boss.         In 1956, Mr. Schweitzer was the first foreigner in more than 400 years allowed to buy a gondola in Venice. Although traditionally gondolas were identified only by numbers, he was given permission to name his purchase ''Lucille.'' The gondola continued to carry passengers and the gondolier was told that if American visitors used Mr. Schweitzer's name to book a ride, they were to be charged double. ''My friends can afford it,'' he explained.         For some years, the Schweitzers spent part of each winter on a houseboat in Florida. The two-story villa on a raft, anchored off Miami Beach, had two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, servants' quarters and a bar sheltered by a thatched roof.         Lucille Lortel was born in Manhattan on Dec. 16, 1900, the daughter of Harry and Anna Wadler. Lucille was her given name, Lortel an alliterative concoction for the stage. Her father was a manufacturer of women's clothes and frequently traveled to Europe to buy designs that he would copy. For some years, Miss Lortel was tutored at home and although she said, ''I think I went to public school after that,'' she did remember that she never graduated. She attended Adelphi College briefly and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. A 1921 review in ''The Musical Leader'' of her  graduating class's production of D'Annunzio's ''Honeysuckle'' described her as ''an exquisite little creature who seemed to be inspired.'' Later, she studied briefly with Max Reinhardt in Berlin.         Miss Lortel made her Broadway debut in 1925 in the Theater Guild production of George Bernard Shaw's ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' with Helen Hayes as Cleopatra and Lionel Atwill as Caesar. She had a small role, which she said had been added by the director, playing what she described as a whore. She never forgot her unwhorelike lines: ''No no, no, I'll have nothing to do with you,'' addressed to the line of men following her.         She met Mr. Schweitzer in 1930. ''I wasn't interested in getting married,'' she recalled. ''I was involved in the theater.'' Mr. Schweitzer pursued her. During a business trip to France he telephoned and told her he was sending a ticket and that they would get married in Paris. Friends persuaded her to accept -- ''You can always get a divorce,'' they said.         When she arrived in March 1931, the couple discovered that official proclamations of their intended marriage had to be posted for several weeks before the marriage could take place. They sailed back to the United States on the Leviathan and were married by the captain. ''I wouldn't have anything to do with my husband until we came back to New York,'' she said, and even then she waited for two more ceremonies,  one at City Hall and a religious service in Manhattan performed by the Jewish chaplain at West Point.         The year after her marriage, Miss Lortel appeared on stage with Jean Arthur and Claude Rains in ''The Man Who Reclaimed His Head,'' but her husband objected to her absence in the evenings. His unhappiness led to a new activity that continued until 1939 -- acting in movie shorts filmed in Brooklyn in the afternoons. This was followed by a temporary retirement.         ''My husband's mother disapproved of acting, and he was very possessive,'' Miss Lortel said in a 1996 interview. ''After a while, I was getting bored. I thought I'd go nuts so I started readings at Westport, moving the tractors and Ping-Pong table from the barn.''         From a White Barn To Off Broadway         In 1947 Miss Lortel was approached by the actor Canada Lee and Philip Huston, a playwright, who needed a place and a distinguished audience for a staged reading of a new play called ''The Painted Wagon.'' Miss Lortel provided both. This was followed by a request from the agent Audrey Wood, who wanted a showcase for a musical, ''No Casting Today.'' Thus the White Barn was opened with Miss Lortel as its sole backer and hostess, providing room and board for the actors.         She had a permanent stage built, brought in new and innovative troupes like the Dublin Players Company, the Oxford University Players and Mr. Holder and his Trinidad Dance Troupe, established an apprentice school, introduced seminars in Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov, and offered playwrights, actors, designers, composers and directors a chance to spread their wings.         ''When the White Barn began, it was to summer theater what Off Broadway is to the commercial theater,'' the actress and producer Eva Le Gallienneonce said. ''An avowed pioneer, it proved that summer productions could be stimulating, avant-garde and enthusiastically received.''         Nurturing Newcomers And Seasoned Actors         Among the newcomers who got a chance at the White Barn were Peter Falk, Vincent Gardenia, Sada Thompson, George Peppard and Sidney Lumet. Working with them were more established actors seeking challenges  -- Mildred Dunnock, Mr. Mostel, Kim Hunter, James Coco and Peggy Wood.         Mr. Schweitzer initially enjoyed his wife's new enthusiasm and the idea of having actors around the estate in the summer. Later, his enthusiasm waned and although he continued to support her endeavors, it wasn't until his later years that his interest revived.         Miss Lortel was showered with virtually every theatrical award and honor except a Tony, which is given for achievement on Broadway. She received the first Margo Jones Award (1962) and the Lee Strasberg Lifetime Achievement Award (1985), as well as induction into the Theater Hall of Fame (1990) and recognition from the School of the Arts at Columbia University (1996). The first theater chair to be named for a woman bears her name, the Lucille Lortel Distinguished Professorial Chair in Theater at the City University of New York. A permanent tribute to her career is on display at the archives of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The Lucille Lortel Theater Collection, an archive of theatrical history and memorabilia, is on permanent exhibition at the Westport Public Library.         In 1986, the Lucille Lortel Awards were established by the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers to honor outstanding achievements in the Off Broadway theater. Recipients have included the playwright A. R. Gurney, for ''The Cocktail Hour''; John Tillinger, the director; Playwrights Horizons, and Lincoln Center Theater for ''Woza Afrika!''         Miss Lortel, who leaves no immediate survivors, was a generous donor in other theatrical areas. She established the Lucille Lortel Fund for New Drama at Yale University to support the production of new plays at the Yale Repertory Theater (the fund's premiere production was August Wilson's ''Fences''). The Lucille Lortel Fellowship in Playwriting was started at Brown University in Providence, R.I., in 1996. She also donated money for the annual Drama Circle awards and made sizable financial contributions to dance and music groups.         ''Honey, I've got a one-track mind and it's theater, theater, theater,'' she once said. ''I have no time for anything else.''         One of Miss Lortel's favorite possessions in her memento-filled midtown apartment at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, where she lived after her husband's death, was a box covered with notices of plays she had produced. The lid opened to the sound of applause and a voice calling out ''More! More!''         Circulating in a milieu where youth often takes the starring role, she frequently sidestepped the matter of age by saying ''age is a number and mine is unlisted.'' When a gossip column last year reported that Miss Lortel would soon celebrate her 98th birthday, Blanche Marvin, a friend, reported that she was furious.         ''This will kill my love life,'' she said.       
         Dr. Mary D. Ainsworth, a developmental psychologist whose work revolutionized the understanding of the bond between mothers and infants, died in Charlottesville, Va., on March 21. She was 85.         Dr. Ainsworth's research contributed significantly to attachment theory, which emphasizes the importance of intimate human relationships, or attachments, in shaping children's development.         Dr. Ainsworth, who lived in Charlottesville, worked closely with Dr. John Bowlby, the British child psychiatrist whose work on separation, attachment and loss provided the foundation for attachment theory. She carried on his legacy in the United States, conducting systematic studies of attachments between mothers and infants.         ''No one had ever looked at that'' before Dr. Ainsworth's work, said Jude A. Cassidy, an associate professor of psychology at the University of Maryland at College Park. ''There had been little empirical observation.''         Dr. Ainsworth also developed methods for assessing the quality of the mother-infant bond. Attachment theory holds that infants need a ''secure'' attachment to thrive, and that ''anxious'' attachments can lead to problems later in life. ''She looked at a way of measuring which babies were securely attached and which were not,'' Dr. Cassidy said.         Though much of Dr. Ainsworth's research was for an academic audience, it also had a practical side. She argued, on the basis of her research, that picking up a crying baby does not spoil the child; rather, it reduces crying in the future.         ''That was a huge controversy over that,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''It had been thought that picking up a baby spoiled it and led to more crying. Instead, it teaches the baby that the world is a responsive place and leads to less crying long term.''         Psychologists continue to debate the issue.         Dr. Ainsworth's research also found that feeding an infant on demand rather than on a strict schedule led to a more secure attachment between infant and mother.         ''These findings had a big impact on how pediatricians advised mothers in the second half of the 20th century,'' said Robert S. Marvin, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Virginia.         Mary D. Salter was born in Glendale, Ohio, on Dec. 1, 1913, and spent most of her childhood in Toronto. She received her bachelor's degree in 1935, her master's degree in 1936 and her Ph.D. in 1939, all from the University of Toronto. She then was a lecturer in the university's psychology department until 1942, when she was commissioned in the Canadian Women's Army Corps, attaining the rank of major. She returned to the university as an assistant professor in 1946.         In 1950 she married Leonard Ainsworth, a graduate student in psychology. Shortly after their marriage she moved to London, where she began a lifelong partnership with Dr. Bowlby, who was investigating the impact on institutionalized children of prolonged separation from their mothers in early childhood. Dr. Ainsworth later moved to Kampala, Uganda, where she conducted one of the first studies of mother-infant interaction in the first year of life.         In 1955 she moved to Baltimore, where she joined the faculty of Johns Hopkins University. She became a full professor there in 1963, a year after she began her study of infant-mother attachment. In the study, she and her researchers conducted four-hour home visits every three weeks for a year with 26 mothers and their infants. It took four years to collect the data and 10 years to analyze it.         ''The depth has never been matched,'' Dr. Cassidy said. ''No one has done it as intensively.''         In 1974 Dr. Ainsworth, who was divorced from her husband in 1960, moved to Charlottesville, home of the University of Virginia, where she was a professor from 1975 to 1984. She retired as professor emeritus in 1984 and remained professionally active until 1992.         She wrote several books and many academic papers, and was a Fellow of the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford in 1966 and 1967. She also received several awards from professional organizations. Last year she was awarded the Gold Medal Award for Life Achievement in the Science of Psychology from the American Psychological Foundation.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Sloan of Vancouver, British Columbia.       
         Michi N. Weglyn, author of an acclaimed book about the internment of Japanese-Americans in the United States during World War II, died last Sunday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 72.         She had cancer, said Si Spiegel, the executor of her estate.         Ms. Weglyn's book, ''Years of Infamy: The Untold Story of America's Concentration Camps'' (University of Washington Press, 1976), was praised by an American Ambassador to Japan, Mike Mansfield. He called it ''a conscience-wrenching book of major significance,'' and said that ''every American concerned with human liberty should know of this bleak period of our national history.''         Ms. Weglyn herself was interned in one of the camps as a teen-ager.         Frank Freidel, a professor of American history at Harvard University, wrote in The New York Times Book Review that Japanese-Americans in the western United States, numbering over 100,000, ''became the scapegoats for the attack on Pearl Harbor.''         '' 'Years of Infamy' gives an appalling view of the privation, neglect and even brutality that the bewildered Japanese-Americans underwent in the camps,'' he wrote. Ms. Weglyn's account, he said, ''based largely on Government documents, is decidedly grimmer than most earlier books on this disgraceful subject.''         In later years Ms. Weglyn worked in behalf of former internees who had not received compensation from the United States Government.         Ms. Weglyn was born in Stockton, Calif., to Tomojiro Nishiura, who was a farmer, and the former Misao Yuasa.         She attended Mount Holyoke College in 1944 and 1945 and Barnard College in 1947 and 1948.         In the 1950's and 60's, under the name Michi, Ms. Weglyn was a designer and manufacturer of theatrical costumes.         Her husband, Walter M. Weglyn, died in 1995. Surviving are a sister, Tomi Fujita, and a nephew, Walter Fujita, both of Los Angeles.       
         Ruth Moulton Gilbert, a practicing psychoanalyst in Manhattan for over 40 years, died on April 30 at her home in Clinton Corners, N.Y. She was 83.         The cause was complications from cancer, her family said.         Dr. Moulton, who was known professionally by her maiden name, was a supervising and training analyst and fellow emeritus at the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology. She served as the institute's director of training from 1960 to 1970. She also was an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and associate attending psychiatrist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute from the 1950's until 1980.         She took a professional interest in the way theories of female sexuality had changed since the days of Freud. She published many papers on related topics, including feminism, frigidity, the changing family structure and the roles of men and women.         Ruth Moulton was born in Columbia, Mo., and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1936 and from its medical school three years later. She trained in psychiatry under Drs. Erich Fromm, Harry Stack Sullivan and Frieda Fromm-Reichmann and graduated from the New York Branch of the Washington School of Psychiatry in 1946.         Dr. Moulton's husband, Dr. Louis J. Gilbert, died in 1989. She is survived by their daughter, Karen Gilbert of Brentwood, Calif.; two sons from an earlier marriage, Dr. David Flory of Manhattan and Dr. Christopher Flory of Williamsburg, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
         Madelaine Chambers, a lyric soprano who sang at the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera in the 1950's and 60's, died on April 30 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 72 and lived in Allentown, N.J.         The cause was leukemia, said Leyna Gabriele, a friend.         Ms. Chambers attended New York University, Teachers College at Columbia University and the Juilliard School. She also won a Fulbright Award for vocal studies in Italy. She made her professional debut in the early 1950's as Musetta in Puccini's ''Boheme'' at the Teatro Nuovo in Milan. She also won several competitions, including the international contest for opera singers in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Marian Anderson Scholarship Fund Auditions in New York.         Ms. Chambers made her New York City Opera debut as Micaela in Bizet's ''Carmen'' in 1954; the next  evening she sang Zerlina in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni.'' In 1955 she was a winner of the Metropolitan Opera's Auditions of the Air and was signed to the company's roster in 1956. At the Met she appeared in Verdi's ''Forza del Destino,'' Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' and Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro.''         After her retirement Ms. Chambers taught voice at Princeton University and the State University of New York at Purchase.         She is survived by her husband, Alex Herenchak; a daughter, Valerie, and a son, Gregory, all of Allentown, and a stepdaughter, Linda, of Stroudsburg, Pa.       
         Sheila Gruson, an artist who worked as an assistant director  with many opera companies around the world, died yesterday in Tiverton, in Devon, England. She was 48.         The cause was breast cancer, according to her brother, Lindsey.         Ms. Gruson, who lived in Tiverton, was an assistant director with Covent Garden in London and La Fenice in Venice, as well as with opera companies in New York, Hamburg, San Francisco, Seattle and Munich.         Her sculptures were exhibited in England.         Ms. Gruson was born on March 21, 1951, in Tel Aviv, and graduated from Harvard University in 1972. She was a daughter of Sydney Gruson, a former vice chairman of The New York Times Company, who died last year.         Besides her brother, of Kent, Conn., she is survived by her daughter, Nina Lourie, of Tiverton; her mother, Flora Lewis, of Paris, foreign affairs columnist for The International Herald Tribune, and a sister, Kerry Gruson of Miami.       
         Ida Klaus, a labor law pioneer who became a high-ranking New York City official in the 1950's and who wrote the law that gave city employees the right to bargain collectively, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         Ms. Klaus was a lifelong labor advocate whose sympathy for the working classes was instilled in her by her mother. As a young child growing up in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn, she helped give free food from the family grocery to striking factory workers.         She organized her first union while still in her teens. She was one of three college women working as a waitress in the summer with several professional waiters at the Gross & Baum Hotel in Saratoga Springs, N.Y. One day, she heard that the hotel planned to lay off some of the waiters.         ''I don't know where I got the nerve, but I said, 'Let's get together and have a meeting,' '' she said in a 1974 interview in The New York Times.         Ms. Klaus became the spokeswoman for the waiters and waitresses, and told the hotel management that if anyone was discharged, they would all go.         ''At which point, Mr. Baum said he knew he shouldn't have hired college girls,'' she recalled. ''But he didn't fire anyone.''         Ms. Klaus's desire to become a lawyer also derived from the experience of watching her mother battle  the court system for 10 years over her husband's estate.         But after graduating from Hunter College and, in 1925, from the Teachers Institute of the Jewish Theological Seminary of America, now the  Albert A. List College, she was denied admission to Columbia University Law School because she was a woman.         She taught Hebrew until 1928, when she was admitted to the law school with the first class to accept women. She received her law degree in 1931.         After graduation, Ms. Klaus worked as a review lawyer for the National Labor Relations Board in Washington. In 1948, she took the post of solicitor for the National Labor Relations Board, a position that made her the highest-ranking female lawyer in the Federal Government.         In 1954, she was hired as counsel to the New York City Department of Labor under Mayor Robert F. Wagner. She became known as the author of the so-called Little Wagner Act, the city version of the National Labor Relations Act of 1935, which recognized workers' rights to organize and bargain collectively through unions of their choosing. The Federal Wagner Act was named for the Mayor's father, Senator Robert F. Wagner.         She also wrote Mayor Wagner's executive order creating the first detailed code of labor relations for city employees.         ''She is one of the pioneers and champions of bringing law and order into labor relations,'' said Robert S. Rifkind, a lawyer and longtime friend whose father, Simon H. Rifkind, was a law clerk for Ms. Klaus. ''She believed labor relations ought not to be under the rule of tooth and claw.''         Ms. Klaus briefly worked in the Kennedy Administration in 1961 as a consultant for the first labor relations task force for Federal employees.         She returned to New York in 1962 as director of staff relations for the  Board of Education, where she negotiated what was reported to be the first citywide teachers' contract in the country.         She left in 1975 to become a private arbitrator. In 1980, President Jimmy Carter appointed her one of the three negotiators in the Long Island Rail Road strike.         Ms. Klaus, who was born on Jan. 8, 1905, received Columbia Law School's Medal for Excellence in 1996, and an honorary doctorate in 1994 from the Jewish Theological Seminary.         No close relatives survive.       
         Alice Adams, widely admired for her deft, elegantly observed novels and short stories, died yesterday at her home in San Francisco. She was 72.         She had been treated for heart problems earlier in the week and seemed to have died in her sleep, said her editor, Victoria Wilson.         In 10 novels and five collections of short stories, Ms. Adams created richly textured, artfully constructed novels about women's lives that sometimes mirrored and sometimes anticipated changes in the society as a whole. Admirers particularly praised her ability to capture place and voice and the deceptively artful craft of her writing.         Ms. Adams was born Aug. 14, 1926, in Fredericksburg, Va., grew up in Chapel Hill, N.C., was educated at Harvard, and spent most of her adult life in San Francisco, and her writing in many ways fused the seductive intimacy of the South, the intellectual sophistication of New England and the sense of adventure and openness to new experiences of the West.         ''She was just so deft and had such a wonderful touch,'' said Ms. Wilson, her editor for 25 years at Knopf, where she published all of her short-story collections and all but one of her novels. Another novel, ''After the War,'' has been completed and will be published next year. ''She was a master at condensing so much, with so much resonance, into a short form,'' Ms. Wilson added.         Alice Adams lived a life full of enough energy, contradiction and nuance that it would have made an apt subject for her own fiction. She was the only child of Agatha Erskine (Boyd) Adams and Nicholson Barney Adams. Her father was a Spanish professor at the University of North Carolina, her mother a frustrated writer full of unfulfilled literary aspirations. Ms. Adams described her family as ''three difficult, isolated people.''         She graduated from high school at 15, at which point, she once said, she ''ran into trouble because of that Southern thing that women are supposed to be stupid.''         She went to Radcliffe College, where she graduated at the age of 19 and soon married a fellow Harvard student, Mark Linenthal. The couple spent their first year together in Paris, where she soon realized the marriage was a mistake. ''I loved Paris,'' she said later, ''except I disliked him so much.''         The couple moved to San Francisco in 1948, where she found little time to pursue her writing. Eventually the couple divorced in 1958. Struggling to raise their only son, Peter, who survives her, she began writing seriously soon after while holding a variety of bookkeeping and clerical jobs. She published her first novel, ''Careless Love,'' to mixed reviews and after years of struggling to establish herself published her first short story for The New Yorker in 1969. She became one of the magazine's most distinctive fictional voices, eventually publishing more than 25 short stories there.         She soon established herself as a skillful, widely admired short-story writer and her second novel, ''Families and Survivors,'' the odyssey of a woman who moves from the South to San Francisco and from relationship to relationship, was published by Knopf in 1975. Reviewers either loved it or hated it, but it established her as a serious literary presence. That novel was followed by ''Listening to Billie'' in 1978 and the short-story collection ''Beautiful Girl'' in 1979. The Washington Post Book World compared the book to the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald ''in both style and subject matter.'' She had her greatest success with ''Superior Women'' in 1984, which became a best seller and traced the lives of five Radcliffe women from 1943 to 1983. Admirers saw it as fusing the sensibilities of Jane Austen and Mary McCarthy.         Not everyone was so enamored. Some critics found her work mannered and humorless. But she became a consistent seller, who was widely admired and sometimes imitated by other writers.         ''No one wrote better about the tangled relations of men and women or about the enduring romance of friendship,'' said Fran Kiernan, a former New Yorker editor, who edited Ms. Adams's New Yorker stories for 10 years, beginning with ''Beautiful Girl'' in 1977. ''She was a great romantic, with the highest expectations of life. As a writer, she was unfailingly wise.''         Ms. Adams's stories have appeared in 22 O'Henry Awards collections and in several volumes of ''Best American Short Stories.'' She received an Academy and Institute Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.         Tall and striking looking, with short blond hair, turning gray, Ms. Adams was known for her sense of style as well as for her liberal politics and her wry view of life.         Describing the difficulty of writing as one ages, she said, ''Some smart person once said that what happens is your critical standards rise, and your talent does not necessarily increase in a commensurate way.''       
         Sara Holmes Boutelle, an architectural historian who rediscovered Julia Morgan, one of the first female architects to achieve major success, died on Wednesday at the Dominican Hospital in Santa Cruz, Calif. She was 90.         Until Ms. Boutelle published ''Julia Morgan, Architect'' (1988), little was known about Morgan (1872-1957) beyond the fact that she had designed William Randolph Hearst's spectacular California castle, San Simeon.         Ms. Boutelle's biography, which traced Morgan's career from the turn of the century to the late 1950's, revealed that she designed nearly 800 buildings, a legacy rivaling that of Frank Lloyd Wright, her contemporary. Her accomplishment was remarkable also at a time when women were rarely able to enter the profession.         Helen Searing, a professor of art at Smith College who knew Ms. Boutelle, said her revelations about Julia Morgan were ''indispensable because before that she was virtually unknown to all but a handful of architectural historians.''         ''Sara Boutelle was not a feminist by today's standards and not strident at all,'' said Professor Searing, ''but she put the spotlight on women in architecture, especially on Julia Morgan.''         Ms. Boutelle, who taught art and architecture at the Brearley School in New York, became fascinated with Morgan when she visited San Simeon in 1972 and learned that its architect was a woman she had never heard of. When Ms. Boutelle retired from Brearley the next year, she moved to Northern California and began to study the building.         Ms. Boutelle discovered that Morgan had worked alone and destroyed most of her blueprints shortly before her death. She began reconstructing Morgan's designs from the scattered records of former clients. In 1988 Ms. Boutelle finally published her 271-page biography, an oversize book with photographs and drawings.         Among the buildings designed by Morgan that Ms. Boutelle was able to document were the Hearst estate, Wyntoon, in Northern California; the Asilomar Y.W.C.A. conference center in Monterey, Calif., and, in Berkeley, Calif., the Women's City Club, St. John's Presbyterian Church and the Hearst Memorial Gymnasium.         Ms. Boutelle found that Morgan also designed schools, theaters, churches, stores, hospitals, houses, apartments, a bowling alley, billard rooms, a zoo, a pet cemetery and a hay barn. She said Morgan had ''a special knack'' for swimming pools, using color, light and shape to create ''sumptuous designs that flaunted a hedonism startling for so modest an architect.''         Reviews were favorable. Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Paul Goldberger said the book covered Morgan's career ''with sympathy and intelligence.'' Diana Ketcham, writing for The Nation, called it ''an exemplary work.''         Publication of the Morgan biography, which won the California Book Award Silver Medal in 1989, led Ms. Boutelle to embark on a new career as a lecturer and preservationist of historic architecture. For these activities, she was made an honorary member of the American Institute of Architects in 1991, the highest award the organization gives to someone who is not an architect.         Ms. Boutelle was educated at Mount Holyoke College, the Sorbonne and Hamburg University.         Ms. Boutelle is survived by three sons, Christopher, of Los Angeles, William, of West Chesterfield, Mass., and Jonathan of Santa Cruz; a sister, Mary Holmes of Santa Cruz, and six grandchildren.       
         Kathleen Kellogg Meserve, an amateur horticulturist from Long Island who produced a series of hardy holly hybrids that have become standard in nurseries and gardens in the United States and Europe, died last Sunday at her home in Vero Beach, Fla. She was 93.         Mrs. Meserve's interest in holly began shortly after World War II when she and her family moved to a 10-acre estate in St. James on Long Island and she chanced to attend a local garden-club lecture about the holly, the evergreen whose glossy, pointed leaves and clusters of red berries decorate gardens and deck the halls at Christmas.         At that time, the hollies used for Christmas foliage were the fragile English variety, Ilex aquifolium, which were grown in the Pacific Northwest and shipped as cut greenery to the East. Mrs. Meserve decided to create a English-style holly that could withstand the harsh winters of the Northeast.         The breakthrough came when Mrs. Meserve cross-bred Ilex rugosa, a low-growing native holly of northern Japan, with the handsome Ilex aquifolium. The results were  blue hollies, hybrids with exceptionally dark blue-green, spine-tipped foliage and excellent hardiness.         ''I didn't foresee my success,'' she later recalled. ''I just wanted to create something that was going to give pleasure and be beautiful.''         Blue Girl, Blue Boy, Blue Prince, Blue Princess and Blue Angel were followed by China Boy and China Girl, each with subtly different characteristics. As recently as 1997, she produced a new hybrid she called Centennial Girl.         The profits from the sale of Mrs. Meserve's holly patents helped to  maintain her estate, which came to be called Holly-by-Golly, and her plants are sold by commercial growers throughout the world.         When honored by the United States Patent Office in 1980 for her contributions to horticulture on the 50th anniversary of the Plant Patent Law, Mrs. Meserve said she held more plant patents than any other person in the country.         The former Kathleen Kellogg was born in Manhattan and graduated from Miss Chandor's School. She took pleasure in telling visitors that her cultivars -- the name for varieties developed and maintained in cultivation -- had been created in a kitchen by an amateur gardener whose formal study of botany ended in the fifth grade.         ''A professor from a leading university with a strong graduate horticulture program visited me once,'' she told an interviewer in 1978 with obvious delight. ''He told me that he was amazed at how his school spent thousands of dollars in research hoping to come up with a new strain, but that here I did it on $15.         ''Not knowing what I was doing was an advantage,'' she said. ''Especially, at the beginning. I didn't know what could be done and what couldn't. So I just did it.''         She once observed, ''Horticulture is the only field in which an amateur can be on the same level as an expert.''         In 1975 the American Horticultural Society honored Mrs. Meserve for her ''outstanding contributions to amateur horticulture'' and six years later she received the Eloise Payne Luquer Medal of the Garden Club of America for her work in hybridizing  hollies and greatly extending their temperature range.         And in 1992 the land of Christmas holly recognized her contributions when the Royal Horticultural Society of Great Britain gave her the Reginald Cory Memorial Cup.         Her husband, F. Leighton Meserve, died in 1968. She is survived by a son, Frederick L. Meserve Jr. of Kennett Square, Pa; two daughters, Anne Davis of Winnetka, Ill., and Marcia Poutiatine of Vero Beach;  seven grandchildren and a great grandchild.       
         Virginia Wise Marx, an educator and psychologist who dedicated herself to the care of children and their families, died last Sunday at White Plains Hospital. She was 93 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.         Since the early 1930's, Mrs. Marx had been involved in community affairs and a wide array of agencies. She set up remedial programs in five school districts and helped establish Westchester County's first full-time child guidance clinic.         More recently she devoted herself to the creation and expansion of a day care center at Westchester Community College. Now known as the Virginia Marx Children's Center, it serves nearly 100 children.         Many of their parents are single mothers on public assistance who attend the college. She created another center at Teachers College, Columbia University, for training educators in child care.         She and her husband, a New York developer, endowed the Virginia and Leonard Marx Professorship in Child and Parent Development and Education at Teachers College in 1993, as well the Marx Lecture Series at Teachers College. That program allows the college to give a platform to top researchers in child development. She also served on the advisory board of the Center for Infants and Parents.         Born in St. Louis, she graduated with a degree in psychology from  Washington University, then received a master's in social work. She  earned a master's in child psychology at Teachers College and spent a fellowship year in clinical psychology at what was then its Child Guidance Institute.         Before her marriage in 1930, she  designed children's toys for Macy's and was a contributing editor for Parents magazine. Her quarterly articles advised readers about child development.         Among Mrs. Marx's beneficiaries were the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, where she was a trustee for over 40 years and a longtime member of its Child Development Center committee. She supported its training branch, the Selig Educational Institute, and the Center for the Study of Social Work Practice, a joint undertaking with Columbia.         Other charities included UJA-Federation of New York, White Plains Hospital Center, Scarsdale Edgemont Family Counseling Service, and Camp Rainbow, a UJA affiliate serving handicapped children. Her interest in American antique furniture fueled her support of the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Friends of American Art at Yale University, and the Art Museum of Sarah Lawrence College.         Mrs. Marx is survived by her husband; their son, Leonard Jr. of Greenwich, Conn.; two daughters, Mary Lynn Bianco of Los Angeles, and Jennifer Gruenberg of Scarsdale; two sisters, Muriel Ducibella of Orange, Conn., and Jane Smith of St. Louis; a brother, Rudolph Wise Jr. of Baldwin, Mo.; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Mae Bertha Carter, who defied gunfire and the loss of employment to send her children to previously all-white public schools in Mississippi, eventually winning a legal battle that confirmed their right to be there, died on April 28 at her home in Drew, Miss. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said Francine E. Cheeks, a spokeswoman for the American Friends Service Committee in Philadelphia, a Quaker organization that supported Ms. Carter and many other black families in the civil rights struggle of the 1960's.         Ms. Carter was born on Jan. 13, 1923, in Sunflower County, Miss. She married Matthew Carter in 1939, and the couple became sharecroppers, raising 25 acres of cotton and sharing the income with the landowners, on Pemble Plantation, near Drew.         In the fall of 1965, just after the Carters had enrolled 7 of their 13 children in local white schools, the owner of the plantation told them to withdraw the children, saying they would receive a better education in a black school.         Ms. Carter's response was to take an old phonograph onto the porch and play a recording of a speech by President John F. Kennedy on civil rights.         ''I birthed those children and bore the pain,'' she later told her husband. Referring to the plantation owner, she said, ''He cannot tell me what to do about my children.''         Public schools throughout Mississippi were desegregated by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, but the state enacted what it called a freedom-of-choice law and used it to intimidate blacks into remaining at inferior black schools.         The Carters, however, resolutely kept their children in the once-segregated white schools, even though their house was once riddled with bullets in the middle of the night and they were eventually evicted, losing their income and their house.         From 1965 to 1968, the Carters were the only black family to keep their children in the county's schools.         In 1967 the Carters and Marian Wright Edelman, a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc., sued the Drew school district, challenging the state freedom-of-choice law. They won the suit in 1969, removing the last legal hurdle to the desegregation of Mississippi's public schools.         Eventually, eight of the Carter's children graduated from what had been all-white schools in Sunflower County; five older children graduated from local black schools. Eleven also graduated from college -- seven from the once-segregated University of Mississippi.         The story of the Carter family's battle was recounted in a book, ''Silver Rights'' (Algonquin Books of Chapel Hill, 1995) by Constance Curry, a field worker with the American Friends Service Committee in 1966, who worked closely with the family. The title is an old rural-black colloquial abridgment, noted by the novelist Alice Walker, of the phrase ''civil rights.''         Mrs. Carter's husband, Matthew, died in 1988. She is survived by five sons, Carl, of Columbus, Miss., Stanley, of Tulsa, Okla., Larry, of Hampton, Va., John, of Lake Charles, La., and Matthew Jr., of Conway, Ark.; eight daughters, Beverly Carter of Drew, Naomi Granberry of Cleveland, Miss., Pearl Owen and Deborah Smith, both of Oxford, Miss., Gloria Dickenson of Battle Creek, Mich., Ruth Whittle and Bertha Huckleby, both of Toledo, Ohio, and Edna Threats of Kansas City, Kan., 35 grandchildren and 36 great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Ellen Sparry Brush, an anthropologist and expert in the archeology of western coastal Guerrero state in Mexico, died May 1 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 65 and also lived on Shelter Island, N.Y.         The cause was a lung disorder, her family said.         Dr. Brush contributed to the field of early Mesoamerican archeology, concentrating on pre-Columbian figurines. She and her husband and colleague, Dr. Charles F. Brush 3d, surveyed coastal Guerrero for the American Museum of Natural History.         They turned up some of the earliest evidence of alloyed bronze production on Mexico's west coast. They also unearthed pottery dating to the third millennium B.C., and identified and analyzed early pre-Columbian ceramics.         Dr. Ellen Brush was a past chairwoman of the Society of Women Geographers. She was one of the first women to be members of the Explorers Club in New York, which honored her this year.         She was born in Manhattan, graduated from Smith College and earned a Ph.D. in anthropology at Columbia University in 1965.         In addition to her husband, survivors include a daughter, Dr. Karen A. Brush, and a son, Charles F. 4th, both of Manhattan.       
         State Senator Wynona M. Lipman, who in 1971 became the first African-American woman to be elected to the New Jersey Senate, died Sunday at her home in Newark. She was 67.         The cause was cancer, her office said.         Senator Lipman, a Democrat who represented Newark, was the longest-serving member of the State Senate. For 27 years she championed the causes of women, minority groups, children and small businesses. One bill she sponsored that became law increased penalties for adults who patronize under-age prostitutes. Another broadened the statutes on domestic violence to protect more victims and increase services to the children of troubled families.         She sat on the Governor's Council on AIDS, the Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect and the New Jersey Court Team on Domestic Violence.         A native of Georgia, she was educated at Talladega College, Tulane University and Columbia University, where she received a doctorate in philosophy on a Rockefeller Grant. She studied at the Sorbonne as a Fulbright scholar and taught high school. While serving in the Senate, she was also an associate professor at Essex County College.         For years she was not only the sole black but also the lone woman in a house she called a ''men's club'' some years ago. She held ranking positions on important committees, including those dealing with human services, the budget and appropriations.         Senator Lipman's survivors include her daughter, Karyne Anne Lipman of Atlanta, and a sister, Eloise Ransome of Virginia.       
         Catherine Brandel, one of the quiet forces behind the culinary tide called California cuisine, died on Tuesday night at her home in Berkeley, Calif.  She was 56.         She had waged a long battle with a rare muscle cancer, said her brother, Michael Terry of Richland, Wash., who is her only survivor.         She was an illustrator, chef, forager and mentor to other chefs as well as a prize-winning hula dancer and  exuberant acolyte of Hawaiian culture. She was a leading expert in wild edible plants and an indefatigable supporter of small family farms.         She opened and championed farmers' markets throughout the San Francisco Bay Area, lobbied on behalf of organic growers and helped create a conduit running from several thousand small-scale farmers to top restaurants nationwide.         One of two children of a Navy officer, Ms. Brandel was born in Philadelphia and grew up ''all over the place,'' her brother said, ''but the place that really got under her skin was Hawaii.''         She grew up artistic and after a brief marriage studied art and anthropology at Barnard College and graduated from the University of California at Berkeley.         Although she earned a teaching degree, she worked as a scientific illustrator before making a life in food in Berkeley. Neither her brother nor her longtime friend Nilofer King knew how Ms. Brandel became obsessed with cooking.         ''I think she just loved to eat and to cook,'' Ms. King said. ''And back in the late 1960's, all that joy and celebration was just in the air.''         Unlike the flamboyant star chefs, Ms. Brandel staked out a quiet role for herself. Initially, she gathered wild fruits, nuts and greens for Chez Panisse, Alice Waters's now-famous restaurant in Berkeley, and with Julia Child she organized the Great Chefs of France cooking program at the Robert Mondavi Vineyards.         She had ''this rare attitude toward food, serious and happy at the same time,'' Mrs. Child said yesterday.         On a segment of ''20/20,'' Ms. Brandel, a mischievous but soft-spoken storyteller, regaled the audience with tales of her curious shopping adventures to supply the Great Chefs of France. Her expert foraging in the Berkeley and Napa Valley hills seemed tame compared with her quest for the rooster testicles required for one of Pierre Troisgros's dishes.         ''Catherine was an original,'' Ms. Waters said. ''She could find anything, cook anything, teach anything, and I'm not sure the restaurant could ever have happened without her.''         In 1988, Ms. Brandel was named co-chef of Chez Panisse and used her position to create some of the dishes it has become famous for, like tangles of wild greens served on brick-oven-fired olive oil focaccia or local cheeses turned into ravioli with wild onions, beets and hazelnuts. She also increased public awareness of the plight of American farmers.         Above all, Ms. Brandel was a teacher. Throughout her career, she was a mentor to young chefs. In 1994, she left Chez Panisse to help create the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St. Helena, Calif., the California outpost of the Culinary Institute of America in Hyde Park, N.Y. Her course, ''Ingredients, Flavor Dynamics and Techniques of Evaluation,'' was one of the most popular courses, said Gregory Drescher, Greystone's director.         ''Rather than simply teaching cooking techniques,'' he said, ''Ms.  Brandel taught taste.''       
         Meg Greenfield, the editor of The Washington Post's editorial page, who brought a combination of sharp-eyed analysis and wry wit to bear on a generation of the nation's policy makers and politicians, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. She was 68.         She died of cancer, said The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham. The cancer had been diagnosed three years before, but not until the last six weeks did the disease sap her strength enough to silence her tart editorial voice. Her last column appeared in The Post on March 15.         Fred Hiatt, an editorial-page colleague, said yesterday, ''When it was time for her column, no matter how her body was conspiring against her, she would summon this incredible force of will and turn out a column that the rest of us would envy.''         In four decades as a reporter, editorialist and quietly influential opinion maker in the nation's capital, Miss Greenfield provided a stream of informed commentary that had an impact on the public perception of six Presidential administrations and scores of policy debates, ranging from affirmative action and abortion rights to the Panama Canal treaties and the Persian Gulf war. In 1978, when she was The Post's deputy editorial page editor, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.         In her role as the newspaper's editorial-page editor for the last 20 years and as a columnist for Newsweek magazine for 25 years, Miss Greenfield pored over the details of policy with the passion of a political scientist and wrote of the complex architecture of democracy with reverence. She also perfected a tone of sly mockery and an eye for the absurd, both of which informed the best of her work.         ''Meg has had a big influence,'' said Jodie Allen, who was lured into journalism by Miss Greenfield and is now a senior writer at U.S. News & World Report. ''She set the tone of debate early, before it became conventional wisdom. It's hard to see, because so many things she pioneered, like neoliberalism, are now in the water supply.''         Though capable of a passion for social justice, she sometimes irritated the city's progressive circles with her skepticism about any government's abilities to keep fallible citizens up to some moral mark. She also arched an editorial eyebrow at what she considered blunderbuss attacks on the conservative policies of the Reagan Administration.         A hands-on manager of both the editorial and op-ed pages of The Post, Miss Greenfield also spotted and showcased intellectual talent. Washington writers and commentators, including George Will, Michael Kinsley, Roger W. Wilkins and Charles Kraut hammer credit Miss Greenfield with starting or fast-forwarding their careers.         Her friends and confidants were legion, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board. Miss Greenfield's diminutive figure was a fixture in the elite dining rooms of Georgetown, where she lived near the home of her employer, who was also among her closest friends, Katharine Graham, the chairwoman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company, which owns both The Post and Newsweek. She was also close to Mrs. Graham's son, Donald, who is the company's current chairman and chief executive as well as The Post's publisher.         ''Meg was unique in her mind, character, and affinity for hard work,'' Mrs. Graham said in a statement yesterday. ''She was both brilliant and funny, a writer and an editor of amazing ability. She will be missed by all those affected by her original, independent thinking, by her family, her colleagues, and her close friends.''         As an editorialist, she was both a judge and a connoisseur of the foibles of the city's political and intellectual elites. ''Her mark was her obliqueness,'' Mr. Will said. ''Most columnists are Hemingway. She's Henry James, using understatement, nuance, indirection. It lasts better.''         Though missing in action from the televised punditry that began to dominate the nation's political discussion in the 1980's and 1990's, Miss Greenfield wielded her influence in many other venues, from the dinner parties of the powerful to the Columbia University offices where, from 1986 to 1995, she sat in judgment on her colleagues' work as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board.         She also had a keen sensibility for literature, history, fact and hypocrisy, and what dose of each goes into a person's reputation. That sensibility shone through one of her last columns, ''Goodbye, Columbus,'' in which she discussed the attitude of President Clinton's supporters toward Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia.         ''Senator Byrd was seen for a time as just another starchy, retrograde legislator, all hung up on the archaic lore of the Senate, ceaselessly spouting citations and precedents from the Constitution,'' she wrote. ''To be rude about it, as they were, they dismissed him as a bore.         ''But when it became apparent that his inclination and his own studies were leading him not to a love of Clinton or even to a degree of political solidarity with him, let alone any sympathy for what he did, but rather to conclusions about the Constitution that would be advantageous to Clinton, all that quickly changed. Byrd became in the Clinton supporters' depiction a great Roman statesman, a man beyond reproach -- a living, walking, breathing toga.''         Mary Ellen Greenfield -- she derived Meg from her initials -- was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Seattle, where her father, Lewis Greenfield, ran an antiques business. She graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1952, with a major in English literature, then spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Cambridge University in England, specializing in William Blake's works.         After considering an academic career, Miss Greenfield decided on journalism instead, joining The Reporter, a magazine of analysis and commentary, in 1957 as a researcher in its Washington bureau.         After three years of largely anonymous work, she published, in the heat of the 1960 Presidential campaign between Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy, a scathing intellectual profile of Mr. Nixon.         ''Refusal to answer a question by setting up a straw man to attack instead is a not uncommon device of debating,'' she wrote. ''But in Nixon's prose the straw man emerges as more than a debating device: it is an innate feature of his thinking. Nixon apparently finds it almost impossible to make a statement that is not, in some manner, an argument. Ideas never quite exist for him until they have been pitted against something else -- an extreme danger, a radically different point of view, or a potential attack from some sinister quarter.''         Miss Greenfield was promoted to staff writer at the magazine in 1961 and in 1965 became its Washington editor. When The Reporter shut down in 1968, Miss Greenfield became the first person hired by Philip Geyelin, the newly appointed editorial page editor of The Washington Post. One of Mr. Geyelin's early goals was to turn The Post away from the hawkish stance on the Vietnam War favored by its departing editorial page editor, J. Russell Wiggins.         As Mr. Geyelin and Mrs. Graham recount it, Miss Greenfield paid a courtesy call on Mr. Wiggins. Afterward, the unreconstructed cold warrior said to his dovish successor: ''My boy, you're making the mistake of your life. She's on my side.''         Few others would try to pigeonhole Miss Greenfield in the years that followed.         A year after she arrived at The Post, Mr. Geyelin made Miss Greenfield his deputy. A decade later, she replaced him. Even though she rose to the top of her profession during the years that saw the rise of the feminist movement, Miss Greenfield kept a studied distance from it.         Still, Miss Greenfield gleefully skewered some of the racism and sexism of the city's journalistic culture. In 1970, she solicited an op-ed article from Mr. Wilkins, a prominent black intellectual and policy analyst, about the Gridiron Dinner.         The piece focused on the raw humor featured at the dinner, which is an annual off-the-record event that brings the city's journalistic and political elites together for assorted high jinks. ''It was a piece that really kind of blew the town apart because people were not supposed to write about the Gridiron and I wrote about how racist that particular dinner was,'' Mr. Wilkins said.         Miss Greenfield and Mrs. Graham toured another Gridiron from the outside, trying to get a feel for the women's protests while ducking behind the dashboard of a car to avoid being seen. After the barriers fell, Miss Greenfield was a frequent guest at Gridiron dinners, attending the most recent one earlier this year.         An avid reader of literature, Miss Greenfield studied Latin in the 1970's so she could read more classic works. She was also a perennial on the college commencement circuit, receiving honorary degrees from Smith, Georgetown University, Wesleyan University, Williams College and Princeton University.         When she first became ill with lung cancer, Miss Greenfield returned to the region where she grew up and bought a home in the Puget Sound area. The property also allowed her more time to see her nephews and nieces. Her late brother's five children are her only remaining relatives.         In 1980, she wrote a mock lament to the knee-jerk excesses of her chosen profession. The piece was inspired by an embarrassing mistake at The Boston Globe that let a joke headline, ''More Mush From the Wimp,'' sneak into the newspaper over an editorial about a speech by President Jimmy Carter. After 100,000 copies were on the street, it was replaced with the headline ''All Must Share the Burden.''         ''That's the part that got us,'' Miss Greenfield wrote. ''All Must Share the Burden.'' She continued: ''Just put us in the presence of that headline and, we can't help ourselves, we start automatically and compulsively writing the editorial that goes with it. It's all about how men of good will should cease the bootless acrimony as there can be no winners in this tragic dispute and the biggest losers of all will be -- are you ready? -- well, of course, the nation's children.''         She added: ''When the end of the world finally comes about and editorial writers are all called to judgment, it won't be the headline pranks run amok, that sort of thing, that will get us. No, it will be all those other miles of editorial prose that fit so nicely under the headline ''All Must Share the Burden'' for which we will, collectively, fry.''       
         Helena Kuo Kingman, the author of several books about China, died on April 25 at a hospital in Taipei, Taiwan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kingman was in Taiwan to attend a reception for her husband, the painter Dong Kingman, at the Taiwan Museum of Art in Taichung.         In the 1930's Mrs. Kingman was a reporter for The Shanghai Evening News and other Chinese newspapers. When the Japanese invaded China in 1937, she fled to England and became a columnist for The Daily Mail of London. Two years later, she moved to the United States.         Her first book, ''Peach Path'' (Methuen), was published in 1940. She  wrote three more books, all, like her first, under the name Helena Kuo, and another with her husband.         Mrs. Kingman was born in Macao  and graduated from Shanghai University. She served as an adviser to the movie ''China'' (1943), starring William Bendix, Loretta Young and Alan Ladd. She was also a writer, broadcaster and translator for the Voice of America and the United States Information Agency.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Kingman is survived by two stepsons, Eddie Kingman of Garden Grove, Calif., and Dong Kingman Jr. of Manhattan, and four step-grandchildren.       
         Wilmina Rowland Smith, who in 1971 became the first woman to serve as a guest chaplain of the Senate, died on June 5 at a retirement home in St. Petersburg, Fla. She was 91.         Billie Rowland, as she was known, was born in Augusta, Ga., on March 17, 1908, and received bachelor's degree from Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa. She also earned master's degrees from Yale University and Union Theological Seminary in New York.         After college she traveled widely,  settling for a time in China to teach the children of American missionaries.         She worked for World Student Relief in Geneva after World War II, and in 1957 became the sixth woman to be ordained by the Presbyterian Church USA.         In the early 1960's, she was a staff member of the National Council of Churches in Greenville, Miss. She retired in 1973, two years after giving the opening prayer at a Senate session.         Her husband, H. Maxcy Smith, died in 1985.       
         Cecilia Danieli,  who helped revolutionize the world steel industry by developing the compact steel mills known in the industry as minimills, died last Thursday of cancer. She was 56.         Though women made broad strides in Italian business in her lifetime, Ms. Danieli was one of a handful who reached the top in the male domain of heavy industry. Her presence at the top, she once said, meant that Danieli consistently boasted a higher percentage of women in management posts than Italian companies of comparable size.         The company she ran, Danieli Group, founded by her grandfather in the family's hometown of Buttrio in Northern Italy, developed in the 1950's from a small manufacturer of scissors and shears to a supplier of compact steel mills to small Northern Italian steelmakers that mainly supplied the steel reinforcing bars that were the sinews of postwar Italian reconstruction.         Beginning in the 1970's, the company began shipping its engineers abroad to build mills in places like Mozambique to produce steel bars or rolling mills in the United States. These mills revolutionized steelmaking and tilted the market away from the developed world by giving scores of countries in Africa, South America and the East Asia the means to produce steel cheaply and efficiently. They ultimately led, in highly industrialized countries like the United States, to the decline of traditional big steel mills and their replacement by smaller, more flexible minimills.         Ms. Danieli, one of four sisters, was forced to take charge of the family company founded by her grandfather in 1914 in the mid-1970's, when the oil price increases in the first half of that decade drained the capital to invest in steel and scuttled further expansion. In 1976, the company posted its first loss ever. That year, she assumed the top position of managing director next to her father, Luigi, who remained president of the company but concentrated on the engineering side of the business.         She quickly rejuvenated Danieli's management, then gained a major breakthrough when the company captured a $240 million contract for a steel mill in the former East Germany from its nearest competitor, the giant Krupp group of the former West Germany. She also expanded sales in North and South America, Asia and the former Soviet Union.         In addition to its Italian headquarters, the company, with roughly 3,000 employees, had affiliates in Youngstown, Ohio, and in Sweden.         In 1984, to keep the company financially as well as technologically fit, Ms. Danieli took the unusual step for Italian family-run companies, and against the opposition of her more traditional father, of listing Danieli on the stock exchange. About 54 percent of the company remained controlled by her and Gianpietro Benedetti, her companion, with whom she shared management of the company in recent years.         Ms. Danieli entered the company in 1969 after earning a degree in economics at nearby Trieste University. A fluent English speaker, she once worked as a student for a summer on a truck farm near Schuylerville, N.Y. She avoided the limelight often favored by Italian executives. But Danieli's business success reflected her drive for technical superiority and her untiring sales efforts. A passionate student of history and a mountain climber, in the mid-1990's she once spent Christmas Day in the mountains of Iran to negotiate a sale.         She is survived by Mr. Benedetti and three children.       
         Patricia Kerr Ross, former director of the State University of New York's Programs in the Arts, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Albany. She was 60 and lived in Albany.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         As director of the university-wide arts programs from 1971 to 1991, Ms. Ross was instrumental in producing statewide arts festivals, workshops and exhibitions. Over the years her office provided creative assistance and support to artists and arts administrators throughout the State University system.         Ms. Ross helped bring dance to SUNY campuses by producing such festivals as the Early Years of Modern Dance (1981) and Merce Cunningham and the New Dance (1987). Dance Black America (1984) was produced with the Brooklyn Academy of Music and filmed for public television.         From 1979 to 1987 she was executive producer of a series of public television specials, ''SUNY in the Arts on Television.'' She also organized faculty and student visits to artists, actors, directors and producers, as well as the SUNY Writer's Festival of readings, discussions and workshops. In 1985 she was co-producer of ''The Educated Eye,'' an exhibition at the New York State Museum of 400 artworks from 25 SUNY campuses.         Ms. Ross, who taught arts policy at Empire State College, was also director of the Thayer Fellowship, which supported outstanding SUNY arts graduates in their first year of professional activity.         In 1989 she founded and directed what became an annual ''Come Sunday'' celebration of music and dance in Albany's historic Center Square neighborhood. The festival presented such performers as Dizzy Gillespie, Branford Marsalis and Garth Fagan as well as emerging local artists. She retired from the university in 1997.         Ms. Ross is survived by a daughter, Linda Proctor of Concord, N.H.; her companion, George Hofmann, an artist and professor at Hunter College, and two grandchildren.       
         Ruth Whitney, the editor who steered Glamour magazine for 31 years and influenced several generations of women during three important decades in American feminism, died yesterday at her home in Irvington, N.Y. She was 71.         The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said her daughter-in-law, Christina Ferrari.         Mrs. Whitney was the editor in chief of Glamour, a magazine owned by Conde Nast Publications that now has a circulation of 2.1 million readers, from 1967 until last September. Part of her mission, she said, was to make feminism accessible, not intimidating, to American women.         Her reputation for frankness reached into the pages of Glamour, where -- along with the standard fare of women's magazines, like frothy fashion spreads and light service articles -- she published articles about sexuality, politics and women's health issues that other women's magazines had generally avoided. And her editorial decisions -- like putting a black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, a first in the women's magazine industry -- sometimes caused a stir in magazine circles.         In an interview a week before she retired last September, Mrs. Whitney explained her goal as editor in chief of Glamour: ''I always felt that I had a mission. I wanted to broaden the scope of a magazine to go with women's lives. I never wanted to appeal to everyone. That's not what we were about, and that's not the secret of our success. But I really wanted to make women feel good about themselves, not just about what they wore.''         Mrs. Whitney's origins were more humble than glamorous. She was born Ruth Reinke is Oshkosh, Wis., on July 23, 1928. Her mother, Helen, was a housewife, and her father, Leonard, was a designer of gravestones and mausoleums, but the only effect her father's choice of career had on her, she said last year, was that she learned to drive in a cemetery.         She was awarded a scholarship to Northwestern University, where she met Daniel Whitney, a journalism student; they married shortly after her 21st birthday. Unlike her husband, who attended journalism school but eventually ran his own advertising agency, Mrs. Whitney decided against professional journalism training and went straight to work for Time Inc. as a promotional copywriter. She didn't last long in the job.         ''It was an election year and I was madly for Adlai,'' she said. ''And the company was not madly for Adlai. So I got more and more sullen and eventually they fired me.'' To her dismay, the young Mrs. Whitney found that she could not get a job writing for Newsweek or Fortune.         ''What I always say next,'' she said, ''was that if you had a uterus, you couldn't write for those magazines.'' She found a job in women's magazines and, at 28, became editor in chief of a now-defunct magazine called Better Living, then of Seventeen. She arrived at Glamour in 1967.         During her tenure the magazine won four National Magazine Awards, including two for general excellence, in 1981 and 1991, and one in the public interest category in 1992, for a series conceived by Mrs. Whitney on the availability and safety of abortions in America. Until her death, she served on the board of the NOW Legal Defense Fund.         While she was editor, she kept a low profile. She never ran an editor's note at the front of the magazine and refused parties for her 20th, 25th and 30th anniversaries as editor in chief. When S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications, the parent company of Conde Nast, asked her what she would like for her 25th anniversary, she asked that he establish two scholarships in her name at the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University.         Despite her low-key manner, she was fond of controversy. When she wanted to feature the black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, the issue was debated at every level of the company, all the way up to the president. ''I never shied away from controversy,'' Mrs. Whitney said last year. ''It's always good for you.''         And she was a champion of women who confronted authority. In October  1991, just as Anita Hill began testifying on Capitol Hill against the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Whitney closed the December issue of the magazine -- with its special feature on notable women of the year -- and went home to watch the hearings. On Sunday she called her production manager and said that she wanted to reconfigure the issue to include Ms. Hill as one of the notable women, which she did, beating most monthly magazines to an interview with Ms. Hill.         Gloria Steinem, a former contributing editor to Glamour, said that decisions like those defined the magazine under Mrs. Whitney. ''She was always trying to get as much real information into the pages of a fashion and beauty magazine as she possibly could,'' Ms. Steinem said.         The combination of fashion and service with strong editorial articles worked especially well on the newsstand. Glamour is second in circulation in its field only to Cosmopolitan. Conde Nast is a privately held company and does not disclose the earnings of its magazines, but in 1997 Steven T. Florio, the chief executive officer, said that Glamour's annual profits were in the ''tens of millions of dollars.''         Richard B. Stolley, the first managing editor of People and now the senior editorial adviser at Time Inc., said that Mrs. Whitney's rare longevity in the magazine industry could be attributed to her forward thinking.         ''She truly tried to turn her readers into not only capable women,'' he said, ''but functioning citizens of America, with all the knowledge and concerns that she felt young women ought to have. And of course she was right.''         The magazine business was long a family enterprise. Mrs. Whitney's husband served as her sounding board on all editorial matters until his death in 1995. Her son, Philip, who survives her, was until last year an executive at Money magazine; his wife, Christina Ferrari, is the managing editor of Teen People magazine. She is also survived by a brother, Leonard Reinke, of Oshkosh.       
         Hillary Brooke, an actress who appeared in some 50 films as well as in the early 1950's television series ''My Little Margie,'' died on May 25 at a  hospital in Fall Brook, Calif. She was 84 and lived in Bosnall, Calif.         Rarely the leading actress, Ms. Brooke mainly portrayed elegant blondes who were ''the other woman.''         She appeared in ''Jane Eyre'' (1944) with Orson Welles and Joan Fontaine; ''Ministry of Fear'' (1944) with Ray Milland and Marjorie Reynolds; ''The Enchanted Cottage'' (1945) with Robert Young; ''Road to Utopia'' (1945) with Bob Hope and Bing Crosby, and ''The Man Who Knew Too Much'' (1956), directed by Alfred Hitchcock and starring James Stewart and Doris Day.         On television she appeared on ''The Abbott and Costello Show'' in the early 1950's, and played Roberta Townsend, the love interest of Charles Farrell, as Gale Storm's widowed father, in ''My Little Margie,'' which ran from 1952 to 1955.         Born Beatrice Peterson in Queens, she attended Columbia University and worked as a model before becoming an actress.         She is survived by a son, Donald Klune of Ketchum, Idaho; a stepdaughter, Carol Klune of Arcata, Calif.; a brother, Arthur Peterson of Seattle; 17 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  June 14, 1999, Monday  An obituary of the actress Hillary Brooke on Tuesday misspelled the names of two California communities. Ms. Brooke died at a hospital in Fallbrook, not Fall Brook; and she had lived in Bonsall, not Bosnall.       
         Anne Sheafe Miller, who made medical history as the first patient ever saved by penicillin, died on May 27 in Salisbury, Conn. She was 90.         In March 1942, Mrs. Miller was near death at New Haven Hospital suffering from a streptococcal infection, a common cause of death then. She had been hospitalized for a month, often delirious with her temperature spiking to nearly 107, while doctors tried everything available, including sulfa drugs, blood transfusions and surgery. All failed.         As she slipped in and out of consciousness, her desperate doctors obtained a tiny amount of what was still an obscure, experimental drug and injected her with it. Her hospital chart, now at the Smithsonian Institution, registered a sharp overnight drop in temperature, and by the next day she was no longer delirious and soon was eating full meals, one of her doctors reported.         Mrs. Miller's life was saved, and so eventually were the lives of all those previously felled by infections of bacteria like streptococci, staphylococci and pneumococci. Penicillin also saved the lives of an untold number of servicemen and civilians wounded in World War II; in earlier wars, people died by the thousands from bacterial infections resulting from their injuries.         Although Sir Alexander Fleming, the Scottish biologist, was the first to recognize the therapeutic potential of penicillin through a chance discovery at St. Mary's Hospital in London in 1928, nearly a dozen years passed before scientists fully appreciated its significance and were able to produce it for experimental use in humans.         Largely forgotten, it came to the fore only when researchers picked up on it again at Oxford University at the outbreak of World War II.         Before Mrs. Miller's doctors succeeded in saving her life, only a few experiments had been conducted with penicillin in mice and people, with results mixed and largely disheartening.         The small quantity of penicillin rushed to New Haven came from a laboratory in New Jersey, and news of Mrs. Miller's full, seemingly miraculous recovery helped inspire the American pharmaceutical industry to begin full production of penicillin.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Miller graduated in 1931 from Columbia Presbyterian School of Nursing, now part of Columbia University. The next year, she married Ogden D. Miller, a Yale University administrator. The family moved to Washington, Conn., in 1945, when Mr. Miller became headmaster of the Gunnery School, where he served until he retired in 1969. He died nine years later, and Mrs. Miller remained in Washington until 1996, when she moved to a retirement community in Salisbury.         She is survived by three sons, Ogden D. Jr., of Vienna, Va., David P., of Darlington, Md., and Dwight D., of Watertown, Mass.; a brother, Theodore H. Sheafe of Tigard, Ore.; a sister, Mary S. Jewett of Lyme, Conn.; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Patricia Zipprodt, the Tony Award-winning costume designer whose career extended from theater to dance to opera to film and television, died on Saturday at her home in  Greenwich Village. Ms. Zipprodt was 74.         The cause was cancer, according to her sister, Constance Zonka of Chicago.         Quite simply, as a headline writer once put it, Ms. Zipprodt had the gift of garb. In her youth she studied art, and then one day at the ballet she discovered her calling. She wanted to make the dresses.         ''I'll design for the ballet,'' she recalled telling herself. ''I'll paint with fabric.''         Years later she described a play as a painting that moves. ''Instead of it holding still and you look at it, you hold still and it scrolls by,'' she said.         Although she realized her early dream of designing costumes for ballet, she also designed for scores of Broadway shows, won Tony Awards for ''Fiddler on the Roof'' (1964), ''Cabaret'' (1966) and ''Sweet Charity'' (1985), along with many other prizes.         Her costumes graced musicals like ''Pippin'' (1972) and ''Chicago'' (1975), Broadway plays like ''Plaza Suite'' (1968), ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' (1983) and ''The Glass Menagerie'' (1983).         Off Broadway, her credits included ''Our Town'' (1959), ''The Balcony'' (1960), ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad'' (1962) and ''The Blacks'' (1962).         She did wardrobes for the Boston Opera, the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera and for American Ballet Theater, the New York City Ballet, the Houston Ballet and Ballet Hispanico.         In Hollywood she left her imprint on ''The Graduate'' (1967). On television she designed costumes for productions like ''The Glass Menagerie'' on ABC in 1973 and ''Alice in Wonderland'' on WNET in 1983.         Analyzing Ms. Zipprodt's talent, the actor Joel Grey, who worked with her in ''Cabaret'' in 1966, said: ''Her hands were all over the work, whether or not it had to do with making a diaper for Father Time or this very tattered but elegant master-of-ceremonies tail coat.''         Ms. Zipprodt's costumes for ''The Blacks'' brought her to the attention of Jerome Robbins, who hired her when he made his debut as a director with ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad.'' He called on her again for his next show, the hit ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' From Robbins, she said, she learned how to use color to help the audience track the main characters.         In 1990 she spent six months researching and designing more than 300 costumes for the 38-member cast of ''Shogun,'' the muscial based on the James Clavell novel about a shipwrecked 17th-century English navigator who is pivotal in a power struggle among five Japanese overlords.         Despite a million-dollar budget, the assignment, Ms. Zipprodt said, was harder than her work on ''Sunday in the Park With George'' (1984), when the challenge was to design costumes that suggested pointillism without actually using dots; or on the 1977 Metropolitan Opera production of ''Tannhauser,'' which called for more than 200 people to appear onstage at one point.         For ''Shogun'' Ms. Zipprodt traveled to Japan, studied the weaving industry in Kyoto that dated back to the world of ''Shogun'' and visited and photographed Kabuki theaters, samurai-movie studios, gardens, castles and textile mills.         In New York she sought out Japanese women to consult on tradition and custom and experimented in a workshop on West 22d Street with ways to duplicate ancient decorative techniques. (The show was fated to run for only 72 performances.)         Ms. Zipprodt was born in Chicago on Feb. 24, 1925. She was the eldest of three daughters of Agnes Irene Turpin and Herbert Edward Zipprodt, an advertising executive. In 1947 she earned a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in Massachusetts.  After graduation, she returned to Chicago and fell in love with Lieut. Col. Robert O'Brien Jr., an Army cavalryman, but declined his proposal because she felt she must go to New York to discover if she had artistic talent.         By the 1950's Ms. Zipprodt was living the bohemian life in New York, where she painted at the Art Students League, studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and waited on tables at Schrafft's until her visit to the ballet altered her life forever.         About seven or eight years ago, after Colonel O'Brien had married, retired and become a widower, he came across a biography of Ms. Zipprodt in a copy of Playbill in Washington. It mentioned that she was an artist in residence at Brandeis University's theater department. The colonel called Brandeis and asked for her phone number, which the university would not give out. So he told the university to call her and pass along a message: ''Bob O'Brien called, and I want to marry her.'' The university did as instructed.         Ms. Zipprodt and the colonel were married on June 5, 1993. She lived in  Upperville, Va., and in New York. Colonel O'Brien died in 1998. Ms. Zipprodt was inducted into the Theatrical Hall of Fame in 1992.         As meticulous as she might be, as committed to researching history, assessing color, collecting swatches, cords and tassels and overseeing the  construction of costumes, Ms. Zipprodt never forgot that her quest for authenticity and beauty was in the service of the hectic and sometimes harrowing institution of show business.         ''Velcro,'' she once said, ''is our favorite word.''       
         Barbara Raskin, author of the best-selling 1987 novel ''Hot Flashes,'' about the concerns of her generation of women, died on Friday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She was 63 and lived in Washington.         The cause was complications after vascular surgery, said her former husband Marcus Raskin.         Ms. Raskin won praise for ''Hot Flashes,'' which is about three middle-aged women who come together to mourn and commemorate the death of a female friend.         Cosmopolitan magazine, which called the book ''a novel so entertaining you'll be annoyed to have it end,'' also said: ''Every once in a while, a novelist comes along whose eye for detail is so precise that you wonder if she's read your private journal. Barbara Raskin is such a writer.''         West Coast Review of Books called the book ''enchanting, entrancing, ennobling, all-encompassing.''         The Los Angeles Times said Ms. Raskin made ''the menopausal hot flash a metaphor for sudden understanding of all the changes'' women of her generation experienced: ''marrying in the quiet 50's, raising kids and feeling stifled in the explosive 60's, getting divorced in the 70's, finding themselves in the 80's.''         But Judith Rascoe, reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review, panned its female characters as ''raging narcissists'' who ''want it all.''         ''Hot Flashes'' was on the hardcover and paperback best-seller lists of The New York Times for a total of 20 weeks, and a movie version is to be filmed this fall.         In an interview, Ms. Raskin said of ''Hot Flashes'': ''I wrote the story I knew. I didn't set out to write a manifesto. I did want to articulate and define a little bit my friends, women I am part of. We had such bad deals along the way, out of sync from the beginning, missing things by five years. I didn't want us to get swept under the historical carpet and not be recognized at all.''         Her other writings included the novel ''Current Affairs'' (1990, Random House), which Linda Wertheimer, in The New York Times Book Review, called ''stylish and slangy, written in a wild and wordy prose that is engaging and catchy,'' but not as good as ''Hot Flashes.''         Ms. Raskin also wrote for numerous publications, including The New York Times, and was active in writers' groups. She was given a fiction award by the National Endowment for the Arts.         Barbara Bellman, as she was then, was born and reared in Minneapolis and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota and a master's degree from the University of Chicago; she did doctoral work at Catholic University.         She was a Delta Airlines flight attendant in 1956 and 1957 and later taught English at Catholic and Georgetown Universities and other institutions in the Washington area.         Her 1957 marriage to Mr. Raskin ended in divorce, as did her 1984 marriage to Anatole Shub.         She is survived by a daughter, Erika Littlewood of Richmond; two sons, Jamin Ben, of Takoma Park, Md., and Noah A., of Vienna, Va.; seven grandchildren, and a brother, Richard Bellman of Manhattan.       
         Donna Allen, an early standard-bearer of feminism who kept an eye on the news and communications industry from her Washington home, died on July 19 of a heart attack. She was 78.         Her family said she died at a hospital but declined to identify it.         Dr. Allen came to social and political activism as a young woman, organizing farm workers on the West Coast and writing pamphlets for the American Federation of Labor in Washington. In the early 1950's, she became involved with the League of Women Voters, which was scrutinizing the Truman Administration's loyalty program for Government employees.         At the time, there was widespread fear of Communist infiltration and subversion. Dr. Allen strongly objected to loyalty oaths and their general acceptance by the press.         From this, Dr. Allen developed a lifelong interest in communications and the role of women in the field.         On the political side, she was a founder of Women Strike for Peace, which opposed nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War, and she served as Washington representative for the National Committee to Abolish the House Un-American Activities Committee.         Dr. Allen herself ran afoul of the Un-American Activities Committee in 1965, when it questioned a visa granted to a Japanese law school dean and leading pacifist for an American lecture tour in 1963. She and two others refused to testify at a closed hearing, claiming a constitutional right to an open hearing.         The committee cited the three for contempt of Congress. A United States district judge found them guilty and gave them suspended sentences of four months in prison and $100 fines. Those were overturned on appeal.         In 1972, Dr. Allen founded the Women's Institute for Freedom of the Press and started a newsletter, Media Report to Women: What Women Are Doing and Thinking About the Communications Media. She edited Media Report, now a quarterly, until selling it in 1987 to another publisher, but continued as president of the institute at her home to the end, organizing conferences and writing in an effort to get a woman's point of view across in communications here and abroad.         Donna Allen was born in Petoskey, Mich., and graduated in history, with a minor in economics, from Duke University in 1943. She received a master's degree in economics at the University of Chicago in 1953 and a Ph.D. in history at Howard University in 1971, with a dissertation on national health insurance.         Dr. Allen taught grievance procedures and labor economics and history at the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University in the early 1950's. She assisted Senator Paul H. Douglas, an economist, with an update of his standard text, ''Theory of Wages,'' and wrote briefs for Presidential emergency boards named to resolve railroad labor disputes.         She was the author of ''Fringe Benefits'' (1964) and co-author of ''Communications at the Crossroads: The Gender Gap Connection'' (1988). She was active in the National Women's Political Caucus, the National Organization for Women and the National Women's Party.         Dr. Allen is survived by three daughters, Dana Densmore of Santa Fe, N.M., Indra Allen of San Francisco and Dr. Martha Allen of Washington; a son, Mark, of Memphis; a brother, Donald Rehkopf of Chicago; and three grandchildren. Her marriage to Russel Allen, a resident of Nashville, ended in divorce.         Dr. Allen sat in the audience when the Committee on Un-American Activities delved into the Ku Klux Klan in 1965, representing the group that wanted the House committee abolished. As the investigators sorted out such mysterious denizens as klaliffs, klokards and kludds, Dr. Allen sported a button proclaiming: ''I am not now nor have I ever been a member of H.U.A.C.''         The committee stopped asking questions about Community Party membership in 1969, when it went out of business. Dr. Allen's group henceforth turned itself into the Committee Against Repressive Legislation, of which she became vice chairman in 1975.       
         Marguerite W. Cullman, a longtime theatrical investor who was also an author, died yesterday in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 94, and her main residence was in Purchase, N.Y.         After working as an editor of the old Stage magazine, Mrs. Cullman began investing with her husband, Howard S. Cullman, who was chairman of what was then called the Port of New York Authority and was prominent in the tobacco industry, serving on the board of Philip Morris  Inc. He died in 1972.         The couple began investing in Broadway productions in the 1930's because, as their children said yesterday, while Mrs. Cullman worked at Stage she liked to be sure that a play the magazine wrote about would not fold before the next issue appeared.         As a family story has it, Mrs. Cullman proved prescient in guessing on behalf of the magazine which plays would prove durable. When her husband learned that, he proposed that she read the scripts of forthcoming Broadway productions and he study the financial prospectuses issued by their producers.         After Mrs. Cullman left the magazine, the couple began their investing, which continued into the 1970's and brought them renown for their shrewdness and energy.         Robert Whitehead, the theatrical producer, recalled last night, ''I could see that she got a kick out of the theater and a kick out of being associated with it through investment.''         Among the hits that the Cullmans helped bring to the stage were ''Life With Father,'' ''Oklahoma!,'' ''Carousel,'' ''Brigadoon,'' ''South Pacific,'' ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Teahouse of the August Moon,'' ''Death of Salesman'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''         During the 1940's and 1950's, their children said, the couple's success rate was so high that their participation in a forthcoming show was enough to guarantee its full funding.         Marguerite Sanders, as she then was, was born and reared in Manhattan, attended Columbia University, worked as a writer and editor for the McNaught Newspaper Syndicate and contributed articles to The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker and other publications.         In addition, she wrote two books, ''Occupation Angel'' (1962), about Broadway, and ''Ninety Dozen Glasses'' (1960), about her life with Mr. Cullman in 1958, when he was the United States Commissioner for the World's Fair in Brussels.         She was also vice chairman of the Lighthouse for the Blind and served on the board of the Spence-Chapin Home for Adoption.         An early marriage was annulled. She married Mr. Cullman in 1935.         She is survived by a daughter, Marguerite P. Cullman of Severna Park, Md.; a son, Brian Henry Cullman of Manhattan; two stepsons, Hugh Cullman of Beaufort, N.C., and Paul T. Cullman of Ferndale, Wash.; 12 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren.       
         Anne Richardson, former chairwoman of Reading Is Fundamental, the nation's largest organization promoting children's literacy, died on Monday at a hospital in Cheverly, Md. She was 69 and lived in Mitchellville, Md., a Washington suburb, with her husband, former Attorney General Elliot L. Richardson.         The cause of death was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her son Henry.         Ms. Richardson was a founding member of Reading Is Fundamental and served as its chairwoman from  1981 to 1996. By the time she stepped down, the number of children the organization was serving had grown to 3.7 million from 3 million, the volunteer force to 219,000 from about 100,000, and Federal financing to $13.2 million from $7.6 million.         Ms. Richardson was born Anne Francis Hazard on Dec. 5, 1929, in Providence, R.I., the fourth of five children of a Rhode Island state senator. She graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe and later served on the Harvard University board of overseers.         In addition to her husband and her son Henry, who lives in Washington, she is survived by two other children, Nancy Carlson of St. George, Vt., and Michael Richardson of Upper Montclair, N.J.; a sister, Mary Conrad of Albuquerque, N.M.; two brothers, T. P. Hazard Jr. of Rockville, Md., and Oliver C. Hazard of Bedford, N.Y., and seven grandchildren.       
         Brenda Hughes Moore, a human-rights advocate and arts consultant and the wife of the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr., retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, died Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 56 and lived in Greenwich Village and Stonington, Conn.         The cause was hepatitis, her husband said.         A native of Richmond, Mrs. Moore graduated from Salem College in North Carolina and studied at the University of Aix-Marseille and the University of Perugia.         She accompanied her first husband, John Franklin Campbell, a Foreign Service officer, to Ethiopia, where she became a special assistant to Emperor Haile Selassie and arranged a national exposition of Ethiopian crafts. She was also interested in the cause of Eritrea, then seeking independence from Ethiopia. Back in the United States, she assisted her husband, the first editor of Foreign Policy and author of ''The Foreign Affairs Fudge Factory.''         Mr. Campbell died in 1971 at age 31, and the next year she married Vernon Eagle, then the executive director of the New World Foundation, which supported civil rights and community projects.         The year after Mr. Eagle's death in 1974, she married Bishop Moore, who had officiated at her second wedding and had himself recently been widowed. She later received a degree from Yeshiva University as an arts appraiser.         In 1989 she and Bishop Moore visited the island of East Timor, and for the rest of her life she championed the cause of autonomy for East Timor.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Moore's immediate survivors are two sisters, Stephanie Hughes of Phoenix, and Lisa Hughes of Honolulu.       
         Sherley Anne Williams, a daughter of migrant workers who became an award-winning novelist, poet and playwright as well as a professor at the University of California, died on July 6 at a hospital in San Diego. She was 54 and lived in San Diego.         The cause was cancer, Kate Callen, a university spokeswoman, said.         Ms. Williams fused her experiences in the dusty cotton fields and fruit orchards of the San Joaquin Valley with historical research to articulate the African-American experience.         In 1986, when she was already a celebrated poet, she ventured successfully into fiction with the historical novel ''Dessa Rose.''         A story of relationships, particularly the one between a privileged Charleston bride and a young pregnant slave sentenced to die after the birth of her baby, the work was praised by David Bradley in The New York Times as ''artistically brilliant, emotionally affecting and totally unforgettable.''         Ms. Williams's language, infused with rhythm and image, transcended the boundaries of genre.         ''While Ms. Williams shows that she can write a novel better than a lot of novelists, nowhere does she cut herself off from her poetic roots,'' wrote Mr. Bradley, citing a passage in which the character Dessa recalls her lover, Kaine:         ''Kaine, his voice high and clear as running water over a settled stream bed, swooping to her through her. . . . He walked the lane between the indifferently rowed cabins like he owned them, striding from shade into half-light as if he could halt the setting sun. . . . Talk as beautiful as his touch. . . . Kaine's eyes had been the color of lemon tea and honey. Even now against closed eyelids, she could see them.''         At her death, Ms. Williams was working on a sequel to ''Dessa Rose'' and on a novel set in the 20th century.         Her first book of verse, ''The Peacock Poems,'' was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award in 1975.         She won an Emmy Award for a television performance of poems from her second book of verse, ''Some One Sweet Angel Chile,'' which was another National Book Award nominee. Her one-woman drama, ''Letters From a New England Negro,'' was performed at the National Black Theater Festival in 1991 and at the Chicago International Theater Festival in 1992.         ''Working Cotton,'' a 1992 children's tale, won an American Library Association Caldecott Award and a Coretta Scott King Book Award, and was listed among the best books of 1992 by Parents magazine. Ms. Williams had recently published a second children's book, ''Girls Together.''         Born in Bakersfield, Calif., she grew up in Fresno, where her family worked as migrant workers. Her father died when she was 8, her mother when she was 16. After that she survived by picking crops in the same fields where her parents had toiled. Her upbringing, she later said, ''was the most deprived, provincial kind of existence you can think of.''         Though an impassioned reader, Ms. Williams had been discouraged from that activity by her mother, who felt she might be introduced to ambitions she would have no possibility of fulfilling. But in the eighth grade, a science teacher saw promise and urged her to enroll in college preparatory courses. In high school, she realized a love of language and was encouraged to apply to college.         The change was unsettling, she later recounted. ''To go from having no prospects at all to having seemingly limitless opportunity . . . well, in my case, I feel I just wasn't prepared for seemingly limitless opportunity.''         As a freshman at Fresno State University, she discovered the work of Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown, who she claimed were her earliest influences. ''I was just captivated by their language, their speech and their character because I always liked the way black people talk,'' she said. ''So I wanted to work that in writing.''         After completing a master's degree in American literature at Brown University, she joined the literature department at the University of California at San Diego in 1973 and remained there until shortly before her death.         She is survived by a son, John Malcolm Stewart of Lancaster, Calif.; a sister, Ruby Birdson, and three grandchildren.       
         Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, whose marriage to John F. Kennedy Jr. catapulted her and her understated glamour to fame, was reported lost and presumed dead on a flight Friday to Martha's Vineyard, Mass., along with her husband and her sister Lauren Bessette.         She was 33.         Until shortly before her marriage, Ms. Bessette was an executive at Calvin Klein Ltd. in New York. Her rise there -- from saleswoman in Boston to director of publicity for Mr. Klein's flagship line -- had been fast, but her achievements were quickly overshadowed by her relationship with Mr. Kennedy, whom she married in 1996.         After her marriage, she quickly became a fashion icon herself, on the cover of numerous magazines.         She soon settled into the role of Kennedy wife, with all the public appearances and public attention that entailed. But she kept a deliberately quiet profile.         ''She's a very private woman,'' Mr. Kennedy told USA Today in 1998. ''It's like you go from having a life you've built on your own terms and all of a sudden it's being snatched away from you.''         Ms. Bessette Kennedy grew up in affluent Greenwich, Conn. Her parents divorced when she was very young. Her mother, Ann, a teacher and administrator, remarried, to Richard Freeman, an orthopedic surgeon; the couple now live in Old Greenwich, Conn. Her father, William Bessette, an architectural engineer, lives in White Plains.         Ms. Bessette Kennedy had two sisters, Lauren and Lisa Ann, identical twins who were born 18 months before her.         Lauren Bessette, who graduated from Hobart College in Geneva, N.Y., was a principal in the investment banking division at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter. She joined the company in 1993 and spent several years in Hong Kong.         Carolyn Bessette graduated from St. Mary's High School in Greenwich in 1983 and went on to Boston University, where she majored in elementary education. She graduated in January 1988 and was briefly a nightclub promoter. She then began working at Mr. Klein's Boston store.         A Calvin Klein executive brought her to the fashion house's headquarters in New York. She was hired to outfit the ''personals,'' friends of the house, among them celebrities and socialites.         Paul Wilmot, the former director of publicity for Calvin Klein who hired her, said he had been immediately stuck by her intelligence and poise. He said she easily juggled the demands of the job, which required a keen fashion sense and attention to countless administrative details.         She was promoted to director of publicity of the collection, a job that entailed working with fashion editors as well as coordinating the shows for the line.         She began dating Mr. Kennedy in 1994. Their relationship was relentlessly chronicled in the tabloid press, but their wedding, in front of 40 people in a rundown church on a secluded island off Georgia, was carefully scripted to elude publicity.         Usually dressed in black, she often wore her hair slicked back in a bun, and she favored simple clothing designers like Prada and Yohji Yamamoto.         Comparisons to her mother-in-law, the late Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, were frequent -- the two shared a Roman Catholic heritage, a thin, athletic physique, a cultivated mystique and a fierce possessiveness of their privacy.         Since her marriage, Ms. Bessette Kennedy had largely shunned the fashion world. Along with her husband, she lent her presence, and sometimes her name, to numerous benefits and cultural events.         ''I don't think she particularly missed being in the fashion industry,'' said John Perry Barlow, a friend of the couple. ''She still had plenty to do to adjust to being Mrs. John F. Kennedy Jr.''         Correction:  July 20, 1999, Tuesday  The obituary of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy yesterday misidentified the college from which her sister Lauren graduated. It was William Smith College, not its affiliate, Hobart; both are in Geneva, N.Y.       
         Kim Perrot, the tiny floor leader of the Houston Comets team that has won the first two Women's National Basketball Association championships, died here today. She was 32.         She died at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center after a public battle against lung cancer. She recently had been seeking alternative treatment in Mexico after undergoing surgery on Feb. 24 to remove tumors in her brain, where the cancer had spread.         ''Who would have thought Kim Perrot would be a two-time W.N.B.A. champion?'' she said when she accepted her second championship ring during a Comets home game on June 22. ''When no one else believed in me, my teammates and the fans stuck with me.''         Perrot, who was 5 feet 5 inches and 130 pounds, was indeed an unlikely professional champion despite a record-setting college career. She held 26 school records at the University of Southwestern Louisiana, where she remains the career scoring leader with 2,157 points. As a senior, she led the nation in scoring, averaging 30.1 points a game.         After graduation, she did what other American female basketball players had to do at the time: she went abroad to play professionally, spending one year each in Sweden, Germany, Israel and France.         But the success of college women's basketball, coupled with the Olympic championship team at the 1996 Atlanta Games, put women's basketball on the American sports map. Perrot returned to the United States and attended a tryout with the Houston Comets, who signed her as a developmental player. By the end of the W.N.B.A.'s first season, Perrot was in charge of the league's best team. In her two-year career she averaged 4 assists, 7.2 points, 2.6 steals and 2.9 rebounds a game.         Perrot is survived by her mother, Consuella Perrot, two brothers, Craig Perrot and Kevin Perrot, and a sister, Loretta Williams.       
         Eugenie Marron, a renowned big-game fisherwoman a half-century ago, died on Monday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 99.         In her heyday, Mrs. Marron, who lived in Brielle, N.J., and Palm Beach, Fla., held five world fishing records; one women's record, for a 722-pound swordfish caught in 1954 off Chile, remains unbroken, according to the International Game Fish Association in Dania Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Marron traveled the world for big-game fish with her husband, Louis E. Marron, who holds the men's record with a 1,182-pound swordfish caught off Chile in 1953.         She wrote a book about her fishing experiences called ''Albacora: The Search for the Giant Broadbill'' (Random House 1957). Mrs. Marron also assisted in research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Miami about the central nervous system of the giant squid.         Mrs. Marron was born on Nov. 22, 1899, in Jersey City and received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Columbia University. She was also an artist and sculptor; she studied with Alexander Archipenko.         She is survived by two nieces, Eugenie Wikberg of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Suzanne J. Treacy of Deerfield Beach, Fla.       
         Nancy Guild, a film actress who starred opposite some of the leading men of the 1940's and early 50's, died on Monday at her home in East Hampton, Long Island, after a long battle with emphysema. She was 73.         Ms. Guild, whose full name was Nancy Guild Martin, was ''discovered'' in old Hollywood style when she appeared in a 1945 Life magazine picture layout about campus fashions while a student at the University of Arizona. With her bone structure and insouciance, she captured the attention of five movie studios, which offered her screen tests.         She was signed to a seven-year contract by 20th Century-Fox, during which she made her film debut as a nightclub singer in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ''Somewhere in the Night'' (1946), starring John Hodiak. Movie ads urged viewers to ''meet that Guild girl; she rhymes with wild.''         She went on to star with George Montgomery in ''The Brasher Doubloon'' (1947), based on the Raymond Chandler thriller ''The High Window,'' and with Orson Welles in ''Black Magic'' (1949). She retired from acting in the 50's and later wrote for Architectural Digest.         Ms. Guild married the actor Charles Russell, with whom she had a daughter, Elizabeth. They divorced in 1950 and she married Ernest H. Martin, who produced Broadway hits like ''Guys and Dolls.'' Divorced from Mr. Martin in 1975, she married John Bryson, a photojournalist, in 1978. They divorced in 1995.         She is survived by three daughters, Elizabeth Martin of Boulder, Colo., and Cecilia Martin Ford and Polly Martin of New York, and three granddaughters.       
         Vera Krasovskaya, the dean of Russian ballet historians and a ballet writer who was highly respected in the West, died on Sunday at her home in St. Petersburg, Russia. She was 83.         Ms. Krasovskaya came to ballet writing after a career as a dancer. She trained at the Leningrad Choreographic School, where she studied with the ballet pedagogue Agrippina Vagonova, and performed with the Kirov Ballet from 1933 to 1941. Her first writing on dance was published in 1941. She went on to study at the Leningrad Ostrovsky Institute of the Theater in 1946 and joined its faculty in 1951. She received a doctorate in art criticism in 1955.         Ms. Krasovskaya did not mince words as a critic. ''No ballet production can be fossilized,'' she wrote in a review of the recent Kirov Ballet revival of Marius Petipa's ''Sleeping Beauty'' that was reprinted in the August edition of the English journal Dancing Times in a translation by Igor Stupnikov. ''Now the company tries to revive what was created more than 100 years ago,'' Ms. Krasovskaya wrote. ''But it cannot pan out. The idea itself is wrong.''         ''Petipa wrote that any ballet, like a human being, is continually changing and developing,'' she added. ''I believe that a ballet production can preserve the delicate aroma of the past and its inherent energy but it cannot be fossilized.''         She wrote about dancers, choreographers and ballet company seasons for Soviet and foreign ballet periodicals. She was a leader in a movement in the 1950's that advocated fresh approaches to dance at a time when  some rebelled against an emphasis on drama in ballet. She developed as a ballet historian as older historians were beginning a systematic study of the Russian ballet history.         Her greatest achievements were considered to be her two four-volume histories. The first, ''Ballet Theater in Russia,'' was published in 1958 to 1972 and assessed the principles and work of Petipa, Michel Fokine and other Russian choreographers. The book provided the basis for a textbook, ''The History of Russian Ballet,'' published in 1978. Her second major history, considered her culminating work, was the four-volume ''Western European Ballet Theater,'' completed in 1996. It was the first comprehensive history of ballet outside Russia to appear in Russian since 1917.         She also wrote biographies of Anna Pavlova, Vaslav Nijinsky, Vagonova and the dancer Nikita Dolgushin. Her biography of Nijinsky, called ''Nijinsky,'' was published in the United States in 1979. It was her only book to be published in America and received mixed reviews. In 1989 she made her first and only trip to the United States, delivering scholarly papers at a Balanchine Conference in Miami and at New York University. She contributed to many major reference books on ballet. In January, she received the privately awarded Triumph Prize, given in Russia for achievement in the arts and literature. It was the first time the award has been given for work in dance.         She is survived by her husband, David Zolotnitsky; a brother, Yuri; a son, Yuri, and a stepdaughter, Tatiana Zolotnitsky, all of St. Petersburg.       
         Eva Shain, the first woman to serve as a judge at a heavyweight championship boxing match when she was assigned to the Muhammad Ali-Earnie Shavers bout at Madison Square Garden in 1977, died Thursday at Englewood (N.J.) Hospital and Medical Center. Mrs. Shain, who lived in Fort Lee, N.J., was 81.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Frank, a longtime ring announcer.         Mrs. Shain, who was among the first female judges in New York State, judged some 50 title bouts. She worked at fights in New York, New Jersey, Nevada, Canada and Europe for over a quarter of a century.         ''It wasn't the idea of being a trailblazer,'' Mrs. Shain said of her pioneering role. ''It was something I wanted to do. It was a challenge.''         Mrs. Shain, a native of Jersey City who worked as an interior decorator and bookkeeper after attending New York University, agreed reluctantly to accompany her husband to a Golden Gloves bout at Madison Square Garden one night in the late 1960's.         ''I didn't want to watch two men beating each other up in the ring,'' she recalled. ''Besides, there were never any women at the fights.''         But she remembered how she ''totally fell in love with boxing.''         ''It was such a precise science,'' she said. ''After that, I went to every fight with him.''         Mrs. Shain went on to judge amateur bouts for eight years. In July 1974, the New York State Athletic Commission named Carol Polis, the wife of a former boxer and referee, Bob Polis, as the first woman to be a professional boxing judge in the state. Mrs. Shain and Carol Castellano, whose husband, Tony, was a judge, were the next female judges, gaining their licenses in March 1975.         Mrs. Shain received word that she would judge the Ali-Shavers bout, on Sept. 29, 1977, only hours before the fight. ''I really did not expect it,'' she recalled. ''That morning I had gone to the doctor, and he told me to stay home because I had a cold.''         Ali won the bout on a unanimous decision, Mrs. Shain giving him 9 of the 15 rounds and feeling elated that she had reached the pinnacle of her calling, ''like when an opera singer sings at the Met.''         Mrs. Shain, who worked with her husband in promotions and sales at a toy company when she was not involved in boxing, remained active as a judge until last December.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Harvey Shultz, of Hackensack, N.J., and a daughter, Barbara Brocklehurst, of Franklin Lakes, N.J., both from a previous marriage; a brother, Jack Inwood, of Paramus, N.J.; a sister, Florence Schiffman, of Tamarac, Fla., and three grandchildren.         Frank Shain, the ring announcer at seven title fights for which Eva Shain was a judge, recalled that the first time they worked together, ''As I announced the judges, there was about a three-second pause -- it was so emotional I couldn't get her name out.''         Later, he said, his wife quipped, ''We're married, and he forgot my name.''         In October 1984, a tempest of sorts arose when John Branca, the chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, announced plans to name three female judges to the Marvelous Marvin Hagler-Mustafa Hamsho middleweight championship bout at the Garden, saying, ''This fight needs some publicity.''         One of Hagler's handlers, Pat Petronelli, complained that ''it's a man's game'' and ''there's going to be a lot of blood and I don't want the three judges throwing up.''         Mrs. Shain did work the bout -- a third-round knockout by Hagler -- but the other two female judges were assigned to a title fight on the undercard.         Hagler's corner man need not have worried about Mrs. Shain being squeamish amid boxing violence, as her husband noted in remembering a conversation Ali once had with her.         ''Ali said to her, 'Eva, if you're wearing a blouse or a skirt and blood got on it, would it bother you?'         ''She replied, 'Well, it's not my blood.'         ''Ali laughed. He said, 'I didn't expect that answer.' ''       
         Patricia Beer, a British poet concerned with death, theology and the mysteries of everyday existence,  died on Aug. 15. She was 79.         The cause and place of her death were unavailable.         Ms. Beer was among the few candidates for successor to Ted Hughes,  Britain's poet laureate, who died in October.         Her poems have been described by  critics and scholars as sly, dry, ironic and economical with well-observed landscapes. Occasionally they were also called prosaic, gloomy, flat and almost housewifely.         Andrew Motion, Britain's new poet laureate, reviewing her ''Selected Poems'' in The New Statesman in 1980, said Ms. Beer ''admits to having been 'a child who dared not seem/Gloomy,' but over the years she has become increasingly prepared to say what she feels. The fear of death and the lack of absolute religious security have proved more than a match for her instinct to explain and placate.''         Ms. Beer's themes often included theology, mortality and daily existence. In ''Middle Age'' she wrote:         Everywhere I look it is the same,         The churchyard or the other side of the bed.         The one who is not lying there         Could have been.         And in the poem ''Home,'' she wrote:         Out of the window         I see the opposite roofs         Fitting well like ours.         This house is as warm         And secure as bath water.         Yet very often         Through the double glazing         I imagine people crying,         Somewhere out there.         In ''Reader, I Married Him'' (1975), a study of the female characters of Charlotte Bronte, Jane Austen, Elizabeth Gaskell and George Eliot, Ms. Beer ''demonstrates with wit, wide knowledge and a bare minimum of footnotes that even the greatest of women novelists were enthralled by the need of preserving the superior position of men,'' wrote Carolyn G. Heilbrun in The New York Times Book Review.         Her first volume of poetry, ''The Loss of the Magyar,'' was published in 1959. Among her other books of poetry were ''The Survivors'' (1963), ''The Resurrection'' (1967), ''The Estuary'' (1971), ''Driving West''  (1975), ''Poems'' (1979), ''The Lie of the Land'' (1983), ''Collected Poems'' (1989), ''Friend of Heraclitus''  (1993) and ''Autumn'' (1997).         She also wrote a novel, ''Moon's Ottery'' (1978), and a childhood memoir, ''Mrs. Beer's House'' (1968), about her upbringing in a family of Christian fundamentalists.         Patricia Beer was born on Nov. 4, 1919, in Exmouth, Devon. She was brought up by members of the strict Plymouth Brethren sect; her first poems were hymns. She went to Exeter University and received a degree in literature from Oxford University. She taught English at the University of Padua in Italy from 1947 to 1949, and at the British Institute in Rome from 1949 to 1951.         She returned to England in 1953 and taught at the University of London. She also reviewed books for The Daily Telegraph in the 1980's and  contributed to The London Review of Books.         Her first marriage ended in divorce. In 1964, she married John Damien Parsons, an architect, who survives her.       
         Sandra B. O'Leary, an economic adviser in three White House Administrations and a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, died on Aug. 9 at her home in McLean, Va. She was 50.         The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, James.         Ms. O'Leary served as an economic adviser from 1986 to 1992 to Secretaries of State George P. Shultz and James A. Baker 3d in the Reagan and Bush Administrations.         Her duties included helping former Communist countries make the transition to capitalist systems. She also worked during the Persian Gulf war securing international financial support and on developing economic policies for the Middle East in the aftermath of the war.         Ms. O'Leary stayed on at the State Department as an economic adviser when the Clinton Administration took over in 1993, and in 1995 she became a deputy assistant Secretary of State for economic policy, serving until 1996. Her focus was East Asian and Pacific affairs.         More recently, she was a professor at the Foreign Service Institute and the National Defense University.         Ms. O'Leary was born in Hackensack, N.J., on June 16, 1949, and graduated from Smith College. She received a master's degree in international affairs from the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies and a doctorate in political science from Johns Hopkins University.         Before joining the State Department, Ms. O'Leary worked in various positions at the Office of the United States Trade Representative, the Treasury Department and the Department of Commerce.         Besides her husband, Ms. O'Leary is survived by two daughters, Glynis O'Leary and Abigail O'Leary, both of McLean; her father, Boniface Brazaitis, and a sister, C. B. Lovell, both of Columbia, Md.       
         Martha Rountree, the co-creator and first moderator of the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' died on  Monday at Sibley Hospital in Washington. She was 87 and lived in Washington.         On June 24, 1945, Ms. Rountree and Lawrence E. Spivak introduced the show on radio, unveiling it two years later on television, where it has since become television's longest-running program. In 1997, at the 50th anniversary celebration of ''Meet the Press,'' held at the National Building Museum in Washington, Ms. Rountree was honored as the only woman who had moderated the program.         In addition to her work with ''Meet the Press,'' she produced several other radio and television shows, including ''Keep Posted,'' ''Washington Exclusive,'' ''Leave It to the Girls,'' ''Press Conference'' and ''Capitol Close Up.''         Ms. Rountree lost a coin-toss to Mr. Spivak in 1953 to determine who would buy out the other's interest in the program. They agreed that she would not develop a competing program for at least two years.         ''She was a news pioneer who helped create a national treasure,'' said Tim Russert, the chief of NBC News's Washington Bureau who now serves as moderator of ''Meet the Press.''         After leaving the program and becoming a popular lecturer, Ms. Rountree in 1965 founded Leadership, a nonprofit political research foundation based in Washington, and served as president of the organization until 1988. A member of the National Press Club and the Women's National Press Club, she received awards in recent years from the Women for Achievement, the National Fraternity of Women in Journalism and the American Legion.         Martha Rountree was born in Gainesville, Fla., in 1911. After spending her youth in Columbia, S.C., she enrolled at the University of South Carolina. She then worked in South Carolina for The Columbia Record, before returning to Florida as a reporter for The Tampa Tribune.         In 1938, she moved to New York City, where she worked as a freelance and wrote advertising copy for several magazines. She founded radio's first panel show, ''Leave It to the Girls,'' in 1940 before creating ''Meet the Press,'' which became the template for the Sunday political talk shows.         Ms. Rountree married Oliver M. Presbrey in 1952. Mr. Presbrey, an advertising executive, died in 1988.         She is survived by two daughters, Martha Wiethorn of Bethesda, Md., and Mary Greene of Duxbury, Mass.; a sister, Ann Rountree Forsberg of Greenwich, Conn.; a brother, Calvin Rountree of Hayesville, N.C., and three grandchildren.       
         Doris R. Schwartz, a nurse who did some of the earliest research on geriatric nursing care and whose findings led to improvements in health care for the elderly, died on Sunday at her home in Gwynedd, Pa.         A former resident of Manhattan, Ms. Schwartz was 84 and had moved to the Foulkeways Continuing Care Community in Gwynedd after a stroke in 1980. She retired that year from Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing, where she was a professor for many years.         Ms. Schwartz's familiarity with the debilities of old age stemmed from her years as an Army nurse in World War II, when she tended to wounded soldiers with similar afflictions. Her work continued even after she began to use a wheelchair.         After moving to the retirement center, she initiated research by the University of Pennsylvania School of Nursing into the use of physical restraints on patients in nursing homes and hospitals; her work led to changes in restraint procedures.         Ms. Schwartz wrote an autobiography, ''My Fifty Years in Nursing: Give Us to Go Blithely'' (Springer; 2d ed., 1995), which remains in print.         In the weeks before her death, she had been working on a book about the 55 people who most influenced her career.         Doris Schwartz was born in Brooklyn and graduated from the Central Methodist Hospital School of Nursing there in 1942. She enlisted in the Army Nurse Corps and served in the Pacific and, after the war, at a military rehabilitation center in Battle Creek, Mich., rising to the rank of captain.         She then worked as a public health nurse in the Visiting Nurse Service with babies and new mothers in the Red Hook section of Brooklyn into the 1950's. She became an adviser to the Teaching Nursing Home Program of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.         She was a member of the Institute of Medicine at the National Academy of Science and co-director of two groundbreaking programs to train geriatric and family nurse practitioners at Cornell University-New York Hospital. There she taught staff members and worked with victims of strokes and dementia.         A Doris Schwartz Chair of Gerontological Nursing was established at the University of Pennsylvania, and a Doris Schwartz Research Award, honoring a nurse for outstanding research in aging, is given by the Hartford Foundation Institute of Geriatric Nursing at New York University.         Ms. Schwartz leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Shulamit Katznelson, who was awarded the 1986 Israel Prize for Life Achievement, her country's highest honor, for bringing Arabs and Jews together through learning each other's languages, died yesterday at her home in the coastal town of Netanya, north of Tel Aviv. She was 80.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         For nearly half a century, Ms. Katznelson taught Hebrew to Arabs and Arabic to Jews at Ulpan Akiva, an independent residential language school she founded in Netanya in 1951. Arabs and Jews often room together at the school to help break down psychological barriers.         ''We are perhaps naive in trying to approach the problems of the region in this way,'' she said recently. ''But we believe that the firm foundations necessary to build and consolidate peace can only come about through person-to-person contacts and the ability of each side to speak the other's language.''         She added that many of the Jews and Arabs who attend the intensive six-week live-in course in a former hotel complex became friends and remained in touch with each other.         The school philosophy includes Ms. Katznelson's conviction that language cannot be separated from culture. Of the five hours of lessons each day in Hebrew, one hour is spent learning about Judaism and Jewish history. Likewise, the course in Arabic includes the study of Islam and Arab history as well as visits to Arab villages.         Ms. Katznelson was born in Geneva in 1919, and her family immigrated to Palestine two years later. Her mother, Bat-Sheva, became a legislator in Israel's Parliament. Her brother, Shmuel Tamir, served as Justice Minister, and an uncle, Zalman Shazar, was Israel's third President.         Ms. Katznelson attended high school and a teacher's college in Jerusalem, then attended a master's program at the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor.         From the start, the program at Ulpan Akiva taught not only Jewish immigrants, but also Israel's Arab citizens and visitors from around the world.         Nearly 100,000 people from 148 countries have studied at the school in the last five decades, among them ambassadors, Israeli Army officers and Palestinians from the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Ulpan Akiva set up two branch offices in the Gaza Strip towns of Gaza City and Khan Yunis.         Ms. Katznelson retired two years ago, and was succeeded at the school by Ephraim Lapid, a former Israeli brigadier general.       
         Kathryn Murray, the hostess of ''The Arthur Murray Party,'' which used comedy and celebrity to sell ballroom dancing to the masses in television's infancy, died on Friday at her home in Honolulu. She was 92.         Mrs. Murray had been the executive vice president of the dance-studio empire built by her late husband, Arthur Murray, and played such an important part in promoting their ''dancing in a hurry'' business that the entertainer Sam Levenson joked that Mr. Murray had become rich ''by the sweat of his frau.''         ''The Arthur Murray Party'' ran intermittently from 1950 to 1960 on the three commercial networks and on the old DuMont network. Luminaries of sport and stage joined in songs, skits and contests, and at the end of each episode, Mrs. Murray told her audience: ''Put a little fun into your life. Try dancing.''         Then she turned, held up her arms to Mr. Murray, and he waltzed her away.         Mrs. Murray made sport of herself for her on-air pronunciation of ''party'' as ''pahty,'' and blithely repeated the critics' assessment that she ''talked too fast, smiled too often and wore unimpressive gowns.''         Robert J. Thompson, the founding director of the Center for the Study of Popular Television, at Syracuse University, said the Murrays ''literally danced an era out'' by drawing families together for quaint variety acts, before rock-and-roll began to fragment audiences. He said that another way to look at the show was as a pioneering infomercial -- ''one big advertisement for people to go to the studios.''         Indeed, the studios were as much about sales as they were about the cha-cha or tango, and it was Mrs. Murray who wrote the training manuals for the franchises, including the lucrative advice, ''Don't try to teach a whole course in one lesson.'' The Murrays and the business signed a consent decree with the Federal Trade Commission in 1960 promising to stop using high-pressure tactics to sell dance courses.         Mrs. Murray liked to tell about the time she got carried away with a prospective student. ''We tangoed, we waltzed, we pivoted and chassed,'' she said. ''Rumba music filled our cubicle, and I did an open swivel and flirtation scallop, then a jitterbug and a Hollywood Lindy.''         The prospect fled in a sweat, and she used the tale to remind instructors to teach, not show off.         Mrs. Murray was born Kathryn Kohnfelder in Jersey City on Sept. 15, 1906. Her father, Abraham Kohnfelder, was a newspaper advertising manager. She graduated from high school at 15, earned a teaching certificate, then was introduced to Mr. Murray when she and a friend went to a radio station where he was teaching dance steps over the air.         She was 18, and he was 29. They married three months later.         Mr. Murray started by selling mail-order instructions -- all dotted lines, arrows and outlines of shoes -- and taught a ''magic step'' that he said could be used 30 ways. The couple built their empire to 500 studios by the time they sold the business. The television show took them to new heights of success. They continued to manage the business until 1964.         The Murrays were constantly mentioned in the newspapers because of their glamorous lives and complex business affairs. After they tired of suburban life in Harrison, N.Y., they lived mostly in hotels in New York and California. Then Mrs. Murray wanted a kitchen, and they bought an apartment on Park Avenue.         Still, they dined out almost every night with notables from radio, theater and publishing. About once a week, they dropped into Broadway dance halls to watch Latin and other dancers for moves that could be simplified for middle America. The Murrays arrived quietly but usually were instantly recognized. In 1968, they moved to the Honolulu penthouse where Mrs. Murray died.         She wrote two books, ''My Husband, Arthur Murray,'' with Betty Hannah Hoffman, in 1960, and ''Family Laugh Lines,'' a collection of anecdotes about celebrity friends, in 1966.         Mr. Murray died in 1991, a month before the couple's 66th wedding anniversary.         Mrs. Murray is survived by twin daughters, Jane Heimlich of Cincinnati and Phyllis McDowell of New Haven, eight grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Viola Sheely, an actress, a singer and a founding member of the Urban Bush Women dance company, died on July 27 in Tompkins Square Park on the Lower East Side. She was 41 and lived in Manhattan and Bali.         Ms. Sheely had taken her daughter, Jessye, to the park and apparently had a heart attack, said Grisha Coleman, a friend.         The winner of a 1992 Bessie Award, which is bestowed for creative work in dance and performance art, Ms. Sheely had a long, thin body and a slightly prim demeanor that belied her intensity and daring as a performer. One of her most memorable roles was as the shy young visionary Hannah, a character inspired by the primitive painter Minnie Evans, in Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's 1990 ''Praise House.''         ''Viola Sheely's range here is impressive, but nothing prepares the audience for her last stunning soliloquy -- a bellowed, ecstatic release,'' Anna Kisselgoff, senior dance critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1991. But Ms. Sheely was just as convincing portraying the lusty, anarchic women who populate many of Ms. Zollar's pieces.         Born in Belle Glade, Fla., Ms. Sheely trained at Florida State University. In New York City, she studied with the dancer and choreographer Dianne McIntyre in the early 1980's. Ms. Sheely performed with Urban Bush Women from 1984 to 1993. She also performed in ''Vanquished by Voodoo,'' an En Garde Arts theater production, in 1992.         A founder of Hot Mouth, an a cappella singing group, she belted out songs in a show-stopping performance in 1994.         In addition to her daughter, survivors include her husband, Oded Carmi, and two sisters, Betty and Carey Sheely of Belle Glade.         Correction:  August 17, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Aug. 8 about Viola Sheely, a dancer and singer, misstated the relationship of a survivor and omitted a reference to four others. The survivor, Jessye, is her son, not her daughter. She also leaves her brothers Michael, Jerry, Joe and Larry, all of Belle Glade, Fla.       
         Claudette Sorel, a pianist who was at her best in music that demanded delicacy and lyricism but who also gave highly regarded performances of difficult contemporary works and big Romantic showpieces, died on Friday at her home in Hampton Bays, N.Y. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for the J. Ronald Scott Funeral Home in Hampton Bays.         Ms. Sorel was born in Paris in 1932, and was already a promising pianist when her family fled France just before the German invasion in 1940. When her family settled in New York, Ms. Sorel became a student of the Hungarian concert pianist Sari Biro. In 1942 she received a scholarship to the Juilliard School, where she studied with Olga Samaroff.         After a year at Juilliard, Ms. Sorel made her recital debut at Town Hall at age 11. Noel Straus, reviewing the concert in The New York Times, wrote of her performance of a Mendelssohn Etude that ''a child capable of so polished and eloquent an example of pianism has a future worth watching.''         With Samaroff's encouragement she performed regularly in recitals and as an orchestral soloist. Once Samaroff arranged for her to play the Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 3, a work she had never studied, on a week's notice. She performed several times in the New York Philharmonic's youth concerts before making her formal debut with the orchestra, at age 17, with the MacDowell Piano Concerto No. 2.         As her career progressed, she continued her studies. After Samaroff's death in 1948 she enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Rudolf Serkin and Mieczyslaw Horszowski. She received an artist's diploma from Curtis in 1953 and a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Columbia University the same year.         During the 1940's and 50's Ms. Sorel toured as a soloist, often including on her programs works written for her by American composers, among them Lukas Foss, Howard Hanson, Paul Creston and Peter Mennin. Her last performance in New York was a 1973 recital at Alice Tully Hall devoted entirely to music by Rachmaninoff, in honor of the centenary of his birth. Included on the program were two previously unknown Nocturnes that Rachmaninoff composed when he was 14. Ms. Sorel had discovered them while researching the composer at the Moscow Conservatory. She edited the published versions of the works.         A fall on an icy sidewalk in 1974 ended her performing career. But Ms. Sorel, who had no immediate survivors, was established as a teacher by then. She taught at the  University of Kansas, Ohio State University and the State University of New York at Fredonia.         Besides the Rachmaninoff works, Ms. Sorel edited some of Arensky's piano works for publication. She also published several books for pianists, including ''A Compendium of Piano Technique,'' ''17 Little Piano Studies'' and ''Mind Your Musical Manners.'' Recently she edited ''From Madam: Selected Writings of Olga Samaroff Stokowski From Her Years at the Juilliard School.''       
         Celestine Sibley, an Atlanta newspaper columnist who for 55 years wrote about the commonplaces of Southern life in a prose as soothing as the hum of cicadas in summer, died on Sunday at her vacation home on Dog Island, Fla.         Ms. Sibley was 85, and her last column was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on July 25.         In it, she writes of her own invalid's insomnia, when her thoughts turn to Key lime pie (''you stumble a bit fishing it out of the refrigerator, and Key lime has a tendency to slither'') and quilts (''when they are old and faded and weightless, you pull them up and remember the women who made them and the families they 'kivvered' with them'').         There were few regional columnists who could match Ms. Sibley for longevity, although the columnist Herb Caen of The San Francisco Chronicle did stretch his career over 58 years before his death in 1997.         But unlike other proud regional voices -- Mike Royko in Chicago or Atlanta's own Ralph McGill -- Ms. Sibley was not forceful as she passed on her musings about minutiae: choosing a Christmas tree, baking a pie, daydreaming about a Civil War battle and forgetting to pay a toll in the process. Echoes of the novelist Margaret Mitchell's ability to describe and evoke nostalgia run throughout Ms. Sibley's work.         ''It was a country-girl-come-to-the-city kind of column,'' said Bill Kovach, a former editor of The Journal-Constitution, who is curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. ''She was the last voice of the white-glove, tea-and-apple-blossom set that had not a sharp edge on it.''         Ms. Sibley was born near Pensacola, Fla., and joined The Atlanta Constitution as a reporter in 1941, covering murder trials and Georgia Statehouse politics. She was assigned her first column in 1944 when she had to take time away from the office to be with her children.         ''For generations and generations of Georgians, she embodied the South, the simple, folksy, homespun South,'' said Cynthia Tucker, the editorial page editor of The Constitution. But, Ms. Tucker cautioned, Ms. Sibley ''was not as one-dimensional'' as her columns about gardens and scotch pines, dogwoods and azaleas  might indicate. ''This was an intelligent woman with a lot of backbone,'' she said.         An article in The Journal-Constitution last week described Ms. Sibley's rebuff to Gov. Jimmy Carter after he had sent a letter to every state legislator disputing an article she had written about the legislative maneuvering involving one of the Governor's bills. When Mr. Carter invited her to his office to discuss the issue, she refused, saying, ''You mean you want to insult me publicly and apologize in private.''         And years after the racial turmoil of the 1960's that transformed the South, Ms. Sibley wrote a 1990 column about the movie ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' marked by a sharpness and almost rueful tone. Writing of a scene in the movie when painfully complacent Atlantans hear themselves chastised for inaction in the civil rights battles, Ms. Sibley said, ''It was an Atlanta attitude at the time, and many Atlantans took it like Miss Daisy, listening and looking at the empty chair beside her where her black servant and best friend, Hoke, should have been sitting if her courage had matched her good will.''         Ms. Sibley also wrote 25 books, most of them mystery novels, including some that featured Kate Kincaid, a reporter at The Atlanta Searchlight.         Her first husband, Jim Little, died  at age 45. Her second husband, James Strong, died in 1988. She is survived by two daughters, Susan Sibley Little Bazemore of Des Moines and Mary Everitt Little-Vance of Roswell, Ga.; a son, James W. Little 5th of Alford, Fla.; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Joan Braden, a former State Department official who was a hostess and friend to high-ranking Washington figures and whose eight children inspired the ABC television series ''Eight Is Enough,'' died on Monday in Alexandria, Va. She was 77 and a longtime resident of the Washington area.         The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported. Mrs. Braden collapsed at Sutton Place Gourmet, a food store in Alexandria,  and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.         For two years beginning in 1976, Mrs. Braden was the State Department's coordinator of consumer affairs and special assistant to the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. She had also been an aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller and had worked in political campaigns for  John and Robert Kennedy.         The 1975 book ''Eight Is Enough,'' by her husband, Tom Braden, tells of their family of eight children. In 1977 the book was adapted as the ABC series, starring Dick Van Patten, which was broadcast by the network until 1981.         In the book, Mr. Braden, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times Syndicate from 1968 to 1986, described his wife's personality: ''She's blithe. That's what it is about her, and that is why she is so everlastingly cheerful.''         By 1976, when Mrs. Braden took up her State Department posts, her friends included Vice President  Rockefeller, Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger and many other powerful figures, who would assemble at the Bradens' large yellow clapboard house in Chevy Chase, Md., a Washington suburb.         According to those who dined there, the food was simple but good,  and the furniture pleasant and necessarily childproof. There were always flowers and candles and, if the weather was right, a fireplace ablaze.         But it was not those things that made Mrs. Braden's dinner parties special, and her invitations a status symbol.         Rather, it was said in Washington, the main magnet was Mrs. Braden herself, a slight woman (5 feet 5 inches tall, admittedly too thin at 103  pounds) with short auburn hair and a wide smile -- blithe, as her husband said, and everlastingly cheerful.         Mrs. Braden herself wrote a book, ''Just Enough Rope: An Intimate Memoir'' (1989). Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Maureen Dowd said, ''Joan Braden has taken a lot of heat for this book, which has been criticized as a vapid kiss-and-sell by a Washington society hostess with the capital's most notorious 'open' marriage.''         ''The title refers to the amount of freedom the author has received from her husband,'' Ms. Dowd wrote.  ''Washington insiders, however, sniff that it also alludes to the fact that she has hanged herself with this 'intimate memoir.' ''         But ''this reviewer does not take such a harsh view,'' Ms. Dowd continued, adding that after all, how can a book be all bad that features ''a shower scene with Nelson Rockefeller, a bedroom scene with Bobby Kennedy, a toe-tingling lunch with Kirk Douglas and an account of Frank Sinatra singing 'High Hopes' without his toupee?''         Mrs. Braden was born Joan Ridley in Indianapolis, and was reared in the nearby town of Anderson and in Washington. She received a bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University, and  worked in the Pentagon during World War II.         From 1946 to 1951, she was an assistant to Mr. Rockefeller, who was then in the middle of a succession of Federal posts he filled before becoming Governor of New York in 1959. She went on to be a special assistant for public relations to  Oveta Culp Hobby, the Eisenhower Administration's Secretary of  Health, Education and Welfare.         Later she and her husband moved to California, where Mr. Braden -- with the assistance of a $100,000 loan from Mr. Rockefeller, whom he had known for years -- bought a small daily newspaper, The Oceanside Blade-Tribune. Mr. Braden published the paper for more than 13 years before selling it to South Coast Newspapers for $1.6 million.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Braden's survivors include five daughters, Mary Poole of Alexandria, Joan Ridder of Denver, Susan Zarker of Takoma Park, Md., and Nancy and Elizabeth Braden, both of Denver; two sons, David, who lives in Taiwan, and Nicholas, of Alexandria, and 12 grandchldren. One of the Bradens' sons, Tom, died in 1994.       
         Louise Alone Thompson Patterson, an advocate of civil rights and leftist causes, a participant in the Harlem Renaissance and a longtime associate of one of its leading figures, the poet Langston Hughes, died on Friday at the Amsterdam Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 97.         The 1920's and 30's saw an artistic and literary flowering in Harlem and an outpouring of social criticism examining the position of blacks in American society. Soon after her arrival in 1928, Mrs. Patterson, then Louise Thompson, gravitated toward that intellectual ferment, which became known as the Harlem Renaissance.         Born in Chicago on Sept. 9, 1901, she had experienced racism while living in a succession of predominantly white towns in the Pacific Northwest, before entering the University of California at Berkeley, where she was inspired by a lecture on racism given by W. E. B. DuBois.         After graduating from Berkeley in 1923 with a degree in economics, she taught at Hampton Institute in Virginia, which had a black student body but a predominantly white and paternalistic administration. She supported a student strike there, then went to New York to study at the New School for Social Research under a scholarship from the Urban League.         Louise Thompson entered Harlem Renaissance circles through a friendship with the painter Aaron Douglas and his wife, Alta, and she married the writer Wallace Thurman. They separated six months later. In the late 1920's, she became a secretary to Hughes, and a long professional association and friendship began.         In 1932, after helping found a Harlem branch of the Friends of the Soviet Union, she became a leading organizer of a trip to the Soviet Union by 22 black intellectuals, journalists and writers who were to make a Soviet-sponsored movie called ''Black and White,'' about white supremacy in America.         She enlisted Hughes's participation in the trip, but the film project was canceled by Soviet authorities after the group's arrival, ostensibly because of inefficiency on the part of the Soviet film company. The real reason may have been Soviet fears that the film would create enmity in the United States and jeopardize diplomatic recognition.         Louise Thompson enjoyed her experience of Soviet society and told how ''the Russians would push us to the front of the queue line for a bus or ticket, or offer us seats in a crowded streetcar.''         ''For all of us who experienced discrimination based on color in our own land, it was strange to find our color a badge of honor, our key to the city, so to speak,'' she said.         The group eventually split into two factions. Those who saw Louise Thompson as too trusting of the Russians nicknamed her Madame Moscow.         After returning to the United States, she organized a march to Washington to speak out on the ''Scottsboro Boys'' -- nine black youths wrongly convicted of raping two white women in Scottsboro, Ala. She later traveled to Spain on behalf of the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War.         She was an organizer of Vanguard, a left-wing salon organized at her Harlem apartment in the 1930's for cultural presentations and discussions of Marxist theory. In 1938, she helped Hughes start the Harlem Suitcase Theater, where he presented his play with music ''Don't You Want to Be Free?'' Hughes dedicated his 1942 collection of poems, ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' to her.         In 1940, having moved to Chicago, Louise Thompson married William Patterson, a figure in the American Communist Party. He died in 1980. She is survived by a daughter, MaryLouise Patterson of Manhattan, two granddaughters and a great-grandson.       
         Chan Richardson Parker, known to many in the jazz world as the last wife of Charlie (Bird) Parker, the be-bop innovator, died on Sept. 9 in a hospital in Etampes, France, southwest of Paris. She was 74.         She died of cancer, said Albert Oehrle, the lawyer for her son, Baird Parker. She had lived in Champmotteux, south of Paris, since 1971.         She lived with Parker from 1950 until he died in 1955 at 34, his life cut short by alcohol and drug use. Robert Dobrish, the lawyer for Parker's estate, said Parker ''thought of her as his wife,'' but they were not legally spouses.         Chan Parker, a native New Yorker, was originally named Beverly Dolores Berg, but as she wrote in her 1993 memoirs, ''My Life in E-flat'' (University of South Carolina), ''I changed that name as soon as I could.'' For a time, she was a nightclub dancer. She became an avid fan of jazz and be-bop. She met Charlie Parker when he was 23 and she was 18.In 1950, she and Kim, her daughter, moved in with Parker.         In later years, Ms. Parker's activities included operating a restaurant in New Hope, Pa.         Two daughters, Pree Parker and Aimee Woods, died earlier.         Besides Baird Parker of Lansdale, Pa., she is survived by her daughter, Kim Parker, of Delaware Water Gap, Pa.; another son, Gar Woods of Long Pond, Pa., and two grandchildren.       
         M. C. Richards, a poet, potter, essayist, translator and painter, who taught at Black Mountain College in the late 1940's and thereafter became an impassioned advocate of community in both art and life, died on Friday at Camphill Village, an agricultural community in Kimberton, Pa., where she had lived since 1984. She was 83.         An artist who wrote poems about pottery and made pots inspired by her reading, Ms. Richards was perhaps best known for ''Centering in Pottery, Poetry and the Person,'' a book of essays published in the middle of the tumultuous 1960's that was impressive for its synthesis of thought, plain speech and incantatory momentum. The book, which became an underground classic, pulled together ideas about perception, craft, education, creativity, religion and spirituality, arguing for the richness of daily experience if carefully attended to, and the creativity of the average person. ''Poets are not the only poets,'' Ms. Richards wrote.         Mary Caroline Richards was born in Weiser, Idaho, in 1916 and reared in Portland, Ore. She earned a bachelor's degree in literature and languages from Reed College in 1937, with a thesis titled ''Poetry of the Tang Dynasty in Relation to Western Imagism.'' She went on to the University of California at Berkeley, where she studied Chinese and wrote her Ph.D. dissertation on irony in Thomas Hardy in 1942. She then began a brief marriage, and taught English at the Central Washington College of Education in Ellensburg, Wash., and at the University of Chicago. But she found academic life stifling.         In 1945 she married Albert William Levi Jr., her second husband and a social scientist who was invited that year to join the faculty of the experimental Black Mountain College, near Asheville, N.C. Black Mountain was a short-lived laboratory for innovative teaching and art whose faculty and students included Josef and Anni Albers, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, David Tudor, Robert Rauschenberg and Charles Olson.         At Black Mountain Ms. Richards taught writing, produced and, when necessary, translated plays by Cocteau, Satie and Yeats. She also danced and studied pottery with Robert Turner. Around 1950 she participated in what might have been the first ''happening,'' with Cage, Olson, Mr. Rauschenberg and Franz Kline. In 1951 she separated from her husband, whom she later divorced, and in 1952 she went to New York with Tudor.         She studied pottery at Greenwich House in Greenwich Village, attended the meetings of the downtown avant-garde known as the Club and worked on the first English translation of Antonin Artaud's influential ''Theater and Its Double,'' published by Grove Press in 1958.         In 1954 Ms. Richards, Tudor and Cage, along with Paul Williams, an architect, and Karen Karnes, a potter, who had both also been at Black Mountain, established a commune called the Land near Stony Point, N.Y. Ms. Richards lived there for a decade, working in a studio with Ms. Karnes; they developed a form of flame-proof clay that enabled them to make ceramic cookware.         Ms. Richards began giving pottery workshops in the early 1960's. Reflecting the ideas that would figure in ''Centering,'' these became increasingly interdisciplinary, with titles like ''Clay and Words,'' ''Clay and Movement'' and ''Clay and Eurythmy.'' She lectured and taught workshops at schools in the United States, Canada and Britain. Her longest teaching affiliation, from 1986 until her death, was with the University of Creation Spirituality, established in Oakland, Calif., by Matthew Fox, a Dominican priest.         Ms. Richards's books, which often mixed prose and poetry, included ''The Crossing Point'' (1973), ''Opening Our Moral Eye'' (1996), ''Imagine Inventing Yellow'' (1991) and ''Toward Wholeness: Rudolf Steiner Education in America,'' a work of social philosophy. The Camphill community in Kimberton is one of 80 Camphills worldwide based on Steiner's teachings.         In 1989 Ms. Richards, who has no survivors, added painting to her roster of activities. She then exhibited ceramics, poems and paintings together, most recently at the Works Gallery in Philadelphia in 1997. The Worcester Center for Crafts in Massachusetts is organizing a retrospective of her work that is to open on  Oct. 9, with a public memorial.         Ms. Richards embraced old age with characteristic openness, writing  a poem in 1997 in which she saw herself as ''living toward dying, blooming into invisibility.''         Correction:  September 23, 1999, Thursday  An obituary of the poet and potter M. C. Richards on Monday misstated the date of her death. It was Sept. 10, not Sept. 17.       
         Raisa Maksimovna Gorbachev, who broke Kremlin tradition by sharing the spotlight with her husband, the former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and did so with bold self-assurance and flair, died today in Munster, Germany. She was 67.         The cause was leukemia, aides to Mr. Gorbachev said. She had been under treatment in University Hospital in Munster since late July.         Mr. Gorbachev's rise to the leadership of the Communist Party in 1985 was the first sign of a seismic shift in the Soviet Union's calcified politics and economy. But it was Raisa Gorbachev who, both at home and abroad, soon came to embody the changes to come. She emerged as a First Lady who had her own mind, her own style and according to reports of a secret videotape that circulated after one of her foreign trips, her own American Express card.         None of this endeared her to the Soviet public, who began to grumble early in her husband's tenure that she was too pushy, too flashy and too influential. Her appearances on foreign trips and her cultural projects at home stirred debate in many Russian kitchens over whether the proper place for Kremlin wives was -- as it had always been -- at home, or at least in the background.         But since the beginning of this month, when Russians first learned that their former First Lady had been hospitalized in Germany with an advanced and rare case of leukemia, sentiments toward her in Russia began to shift. Favorable articles began to appear in the press, and thousands of letters and telegrams of sympathy arrived at the hospital in Munster, where her husband kept a faithful vigil that touched many Russian hearts. ''It must be in the Russian character -- to run somebody into the mud, and them laud them to high heavens after a tragedy strikes,'' said Vladimir Polyakov, a Gorbachev spokesman.         President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev's bitter rival in the early 1990's, sent a message of condolence today, and in a statement he said that a ''wonderful person, a beautiful woman, a loving wife and mother is no longer with us.''         In his autobiography, published in 1996, Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged that the resentment over his wife's high profile surfaced in letters written to the Communist Party's Central Committee. ''Who does she think she is, a member of the Politburo?'' he quoted one as saying. ''The simplest answer would have been: 'No, she is my wife.' ''         She first became known in the West in 1984 when she accompanied her husband, then a ranking member of the Soviet Politburo, to Britain, where they were received by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Diplomats and reporters, scanning the couple for clues about the next generation of Soviet leaders, quickly focused up on her wardrobe -- in particular her gold lame sandals with chain straps, a far cry from the dowdy shoes worn by other Kremlin wives. On a later trip to France, the French press labeled her clothes ''elegant, but not chic.''         On her foreign travels, she also became known for a haughty conversational style that bordered on the pedantic. During the 1986 summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, she needled her tour guides with persistent questioning, adding didactic commentary of her own. Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, she irked Nancy Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American President's wife to quip, ''Who does that dame think she is?''         As she became more comfortable in her role as the Soviet First Lady, she loosened up and her wardrobe became more subdued. On a visit to Washington in 1990, she established more friendly relations with Barbara Bush, from whom she got a recipe for blueberry pie.         Born in the Siberian city of Rubtsovsk, Raisa Titarenko grew up as the daughter of a railway engineer. She graduated from school with a gold medal -- top honors in the Soviet system -- and went on to the prestigious University of Moscow. She was studying philosophy there when she met Mr. Gorbachev, then a law student. According to his book, he was smitten, but she was aloof.         ''Our first meeting had not impressed Raisa at all,'' he wrote. ''She seemed calm and indifferent -- judging by the look in her eyes.'' Not much later, at an impromptu party staged by Mr. Gorbachev's roommates for Raisa and her friends, ''I wanted to impress her,'' he wrote, but ''I think I made a terrible fool of myself. She was reserved and was the first to suggest breaking up the gathering.''         After an intense courtship, the two penniless students were married in 1953, the year of Stalin's death. They had one daughter, Irina, born in 1956, who survives her along with Mr. Gorbachev and two granddaughters.         After the couple completed their college work in 1955, the family returned to Mr. Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol in southern Russia. There Mrs. Gorbachev completed a doctoral dissertation, entitled ''The Emergence of New Characteristics in the Daily Life of Collective Farm Peasantry,'' based on an unusual amount of field research, which was accepted by the Lenin Pedagogical Institute in Moscow.         When her husband, then first party secretary in Stavropol, was promoted to Moscow as a Central Committee secretary in charge of agriculture, she returned to academics, taking a job as lecturer in philosophy at Moscow University, a position which she gave up when he became General Secretary of the Communist Party.         As the wife of the Soviet leader, she was enlisted as a board member of the Soviet Cultural Foundation, headed by Dmitri S. Likhachev, one of Russia's most distinguished academicians, which was created to promote the arts and to restore the country's cultural heritage.         In this role, she became one of her husband's conduits to the Russian intelligentsia, which was then rallying to his call for more ''glasnost,'' or openness. As Soviet censorship eased, the Soviet people rushed to rediscover books and parts of their own history that had been buried under a rigid Communist ideology.         Mrs. Gorbachev's most traumatic moments came during the August 1991 coup, when the Gorbachevs were held hostage at a seaside villa in the Crimea while a group of Communist hard-liners tried to seize control in Moscow. The coup failed, and Mr. Gorbachev and his family returned to Moscow, visibly shaken. ''Raisa Maksimovna took it very hard,'' said Mr. Gorbachev at a news conference after their return to Moscow.         In 1991, Raisa Gorbachev published a book of reminiscences, entitled in English, ''I Hope,'' which she decided to write after a visit with Mrs. Bush in 1990 to Wellesley College where, she said, ''the girls showered me with questions.'' Reviewers found the book self-serving in parts but also informative about the couple's intellectual journey as, together, they came to realize the flaws in the Soviet system.         In her last years, Mrs. Gorbachev started a club that drew together a dozen well-known and high-powered Russian women for conferences, charitable projects and informal debates. She described the group as an attempt to promote a civil society in Russia. Against her wishes, the club became known as the Raisa Maksimovna Club.         Lyudmila Telen, a deputy editor at the newspaper Moscow News and a member of the club, said her impressions of Mrs. Gorbachev changed as she got to know her better. ''She set herself very high goals -- she felt she had to improve herself,'' said Ms. Telen. ''Going from wife of a provincial first secretary to First Lady was a big jump.         ''She wanted to represent the country in a new way. She understood that what Mikhail Sergeyevich was doing was a revolution, but she had many complexes, too -- a natural reserve and a Soviet way of behavior that she tried to overcome.''         Ms. Telen said Mrs. Gorbachev was well aware of the resentment against her felt by many Russians. But she herself was never bitter. ''She realized that people had been used to different women, different traditions, different leaders,'' said Ms. Telen. ''She understood it. It hurt her of course, but I never heard her be mean or bitter about it.''         As a couple, the Gorbachevs shared interests in philosophy and literature, theater and politics. Mr. Gorbachev on several occasions acknowledged that he often turned to his wife for advice. In his book, he recalled how the two would have their most serious discussions in the garden of their Government-provided apartment, beyond the earshot of K.G.B. eavesdropping devices.         Their close relationship was the envy of their friends. At a dinner in Paris in the fall of 1985, her host said she confided: ''I am very lucky with Mikhail. We are really friends, or if you prefer, we have great complicity.''         After the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin took over Mr. Gorbachev's office in the Kremlin, he became a political pariah in Russia, widely blamed for ushering in reforms that led to a decade of political and economic instability.         After a disastrous run for the presidency in 1996, he maintained a low profile at home, while Mrs. Gorbachev, who accompanied him on the international lecture circuit, became practically invisible until her recent illness.         With a diagnosis of acute lukemia, Mrs. Gorbachev was rushed to the hospital in Munster on July 25. News of her hospitalization became public only in early August.         According to Russian news reports, Mr. Gorbachev remained at her side day and night. ''Dear God,'' the former Soviet President, visibly exhausted, told a Russian television reporter on Aug. 9, ''for her to undergo such a drama these two days before my very eyes.''       
         Tahia Carioca, the Egyptian belly dancer often called the Marilyn Monroe of the Arab world, died of a heart attack in a Cairo hospital on Monday.  She was 79.         Miss Carioca's parents were mortified when as a teen-ager she took her beauty and talent to a Cairo nightclub to dance for strangers, but it was the beginning of a journey that would make her one of the world's most renowned belly dancers.         Though the hold of fundamentalist Islam on Egyptian society has virtually wiped out public manifestations of her art, she was in the end granted the official approval her parents withheld, as the Egyptian Culture Minister, Farouk Hosni, led her funeral procession.         The stuff of legend, she married 14 different husbands and once slapped King Farouk when he threw an ice cube down her dress. She had roles in more than 300 movies and television shows.         But beyond mere fame, she virtually defined the intricate, pulsating art called raqs sharqi in Arabic nations but known in the West as the belly dance since a promoter at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair dreamed up the name.         Belly dancers cover less territory than Western dancers, concentrating instead on often minute movements, sometimes emphasizing such tiny muscular articulations as a quivering lower lip.         ''You really liked watching her; she would draw you in,'' said Morocco, a New York dancer who was inspired by Miss Carioca and herself became a leading international performer. She recalled the intensity of Miss Carioca's musicality and her grace.         When another great Egyptian belly dancer, Samia Gamal, died in 1994, her funeral was officially ignored,  Morocco said. Her style of dancing was sometimes called coltish or kittenish, in contrast to the strength and dignity of Miss Carioca's approach.  Miss Carioca used her many films to raise the status of Middle Eastern  dance.         ''She got it recognized as part of the Egyptian fine arts landscape through her portrayals of it in movies,'' said Julie Elliot, a belly dancer who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. ''She was a pioneer of modern oriental dance as it is done today.''         Miss Carioca, originally named Abla Mohammed Karim, was born in 1920. She studied dance at Ivanova Belly Dancing School in Cairo before moving to Mohammed Ali Street, Cairo's 1930's and 40's version of Broadway. She took her stage names from the Brazilian sambas she liked to perform.         Miss Carioca became one of the biggest stars at a Cairo nightclub owned by Badia Massabni, a Lebanese woman. The club was an elegant re-creation of a British music hall and was frequented by both British colonial administrators and the local aristocracy. Women as well as men were part of the audience. Dancers wore elegant, bejeweled gowns, sometimes with bare midriffs and sometimes not.         But the nice surroundings did not make belly dancing, something that up until that time had been performed mainly at private weddings and celebrations, publicly respectable.         ''Many men would reject the trade and would never marry a female performer,'' Karin van Nieuwkerk wrote in a 1995 book about Egyptian dancers called ''A Trade Like Any Other'' and published by the University of Texas Press.         The dancer Morocco said, ''Women do not show themselves publicly outside the family and, maybe, somebody they're going to marry.''         Of course, Miss Carioca married many interesting men, among them an American army officer whom she met during World War II, an actor and a prominent playwright.         That none of the matches lasted long may have owed something to her sometimes assertive personality, Morocco said. ''She was sort of a big mouth,'' she said, ''but very sweet.''         Miss Carioca is survived by an adopted daughter, Atiyat Allah.         Her first film was ''Doctor Farahat'' in 1935, directed by Togo Mizrahi. One of her most popular movies was ''Youth of a Woman,'' in which she played a landlady who seduces a naive, young peasant student. It was shown at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival.         ''She was an important part of Egypt's movie history,'' said the film director Gulal Sharqawi.         She gave up dancing in 1963 but as late as the mid-1980's ran her own theater in Cairo, helping to write and choose plays, as well as directing and producing.         She took to wearing the Islamic head scarf before retiring completely from public view 13 years ago.       
         Diane Erickson, a model who was on the cover of Self magazine's first issue in 1979 and who later became a fashion photographer, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She was 43.         She died from complications from breast cancer, said Meg D'Incecco, the public relations director of Self, a health and fitness magazine for women.         Ms. Erickson acted in several films, including ''Jagged Edge'' and ''Runaway Train.'' After her cancer was diagnosed last year, Ms. Erickson wrote a monthly chronicle of her fight against cancer called ''Diane's Diary'' for Self.         She also began to create a visual and literary record of her life and was preparing it as a book with a friend.         Mason Flaine, chairman of C.R.C. Press, a specialized publishing house, said he planned to publish the book when the friend completed it.         Born on May 24, 1956, in the Boston area, Ms. Erickson studied photography at the State University of New York at Buffalo and later worked with well-known fashion photographers.         She was legally separated from her husband, Michael Charles. She is survived by her daughter, Helena, of Manhattan; her mother, Mary Helfer of Centerville, Tex.; two brothers, John Erickson of Cleveland and Thomas Erickson of Houston, and two sisters, Christina Reid of Sugarland, Tex., and Jane Ashmore of Texas.       
         She had not even known exactly what the word ''philanthropy'' meant, but the elderly washerwoman who gave away practically every dollar she ever made to endow a scholarship fund for poor students in Mississippi would become a symbol of selfless giving.         Oseola McCarty, who gave away a life savings of $150,000 to help complete strangers get a college education at the University of Southern Mississippi here in her hometown, died late Sunday afternoon in the frame house where she took in laundry and ironing and made her small fortune a dollar or two at a time.         Miss McCarty was told that she had liver cancer three weeks ago, about a year after she underwent surgery for colon cancer. She wanted her last days to be spent in the little house where she spent most of her life. She was 91.         ''I don't want to close my eyes because I don't know if I'll open them again,'' the tiny, frail woman told a visitor recently. ''But I am not afraid.''         In anticipation of her death, she decided in the summer of 1995 to give away most of her life savings, saying there was nothing in particular she wanted to buy and no place in particular she wanted to go. An only child who had outlived her relatives, she lived a solitary existence, surrounded by rows of clothes she made pretty for people who knew her only as the washerwoman.         ''I'm giving it away so that the children won't have to work so hard, like I did,'' she said in July 1995.         She did not want any monuments, any proclamations, said people who  knew her. But the selflessness of her gift would bring her worldwide attention. The woman who had gone out only for some preaching at the Friendship Baptist Church in Hattiesburg and to buy groceries would be honored by the United Nations, would shake hands with President Clinton and would receive more than 300 awards. People all over the world knew who she was and what she did.         The woman who acted in anticipation of death found a life she could have never imagined. She flew on a plane for the first time in her life and laughed out loud when the food did not fall off the tray as the plane rumbled through the sky. She stayed in a hotel for the first time in her life, and before she checked out, she made the bed.         ''People treated her like a monument,'' said Jewel Tucker, the secretary to the president of the university and Miss McCarty's traveling companion in those almost giddy years after the gift. ''But she was really a movement. It will keep moving.''         Contributions from more than 600 donors have added some $330,000 to the original scholarship fund of $150,000. After hearing of Miss McCarty's gift, Ted Turner, a multibillionaire, gave away a billion dollars.         ''He said, 'If that little woman can give away everything she has, then I can give a billion,' '' Ms. Tucker said.         If anyone can say they felt adoration in their life, Ms. Tucker said, Miss McCarty could. People would see her in airports and flock to her. Some people just wanted to touch her, as though she was good luck.         Along with all the plaques and trophies or other honors -- she received the Presidential Citizen's Medal, the nation's second-highest civilian award, and an honorary doctorate from Harvard University -- she was awarded other things that were pure fun.         In 1996, she carried the Olympic torch through part of Mississippi. Later that year, hers was the hand on the switch that dropped the ball in Times Square in New York's New Year's Eve celebration. In fact, she said at the time, it was the first time she had stayed up past midnight.         Miss McCarty will lie in state in the rotunda of the university's main building on Saturday.         Friends like Aubrey K. Lucas, president emeritus of the University of Southern Mississippi, said it warmed him and others that came into contact with her to know that a lifetime of loneliness had been pushed aside by all the positive attention that her gift brought.         Horace Fleming, the university's president, said he sometimes wondered if all the attention that came her way was really welcome. But he believes now that it was.         Her traveling companion, Ms. Tucker, knows that Miss McCarty did enjoy it.         Although she never asked for it, ''She loved every minute of it,'' Ms. Tucker said.         In time, people came to see her almost like an oracle and listened closely for pearls of wisdom at the little woman's knee.         But her friends know that Miss McCarty's wisdom was really a mix of common decency and common sense.         ''There's a lot of talk about self-esteem these days,'' she once said. ''It seems pretty basic to me. If you want to feel proud of yourself, you've got to do things you can be proud of. Feelings follow actions.''         The university's president said that a New York reporter once asked him out of earshot of Miss McCarty to tell him the true story of her gift.         ''How did it really happen?'' the reporter asked him.         The president told the reporter that it happened just as Miss McCarty said, that she had wanted to do something good with the money she had made. It is not any more complicated than that, Mr. Fleming said.         In a world in which people are suspicious of things too good to be true, he said, Miss McCarty really was good and true.       
         Anneli Cahn Lax, a professor and editor who was a leader in the publishing of mathematical literature, died on Friday at her home on Manhattan's Upper West Side. She was 77.         Professor Lax had pancreatic cancer, said her husband, Peter Lax.         She retired in 1992 from New York University, where she had been a professor for 31 years after holding other posts there for 18 years.         In her dissertation at N.Y.U. and in later publications, she made significant contributions to the theory of hyperbolic equations, a complex mathematical theory about aspects of the behavior of many kinds of waves.         She may be best known, however,  for her contributions to the understanding of mathematics by both students and lay people, especially as the editor of the Mathematical Association of America's New Mathematical Library Series.         The series, started in 1961, included 36 published volumes by 1995. It was planned, by Professor Lax and others, to make mathematics accessible to the general reader without stinting on technical accuracy. Its first two books, ''Numbers: Rational and Irrational'' by Ivan Niven and ''What Is Calculus About?'' by W. W. Sawyer, are still in print after a third of a century.         In addition, Professor Lax ''led the way in changing mathematical pedagogy, in exploring the connections of mathematics to the larger curriculum, in understanding the interplay between language and mathematics,'' Joanne V. Creighton, president of Mount Holyoke College, said in awarding her an honorary degree in 1997.         President Creighton said Professor Lax's experiences in mathematics and family life had endowed her with a special awareness of the challenges confronting young women interested in mathematics.         Professor Lax was a longtime active member of the New York Academy of Sciences and was instrumental in shaping its program of science education for children.         ''There is a misconception among people and schoolchildren about the nature of mathematics,'' she said in a 1979 interview. ''They consider it a matter of rules and regulations instead of thinking.'' The pressure, she said, was for pupils to come up with the right answer quickly, without time to analyze.         The honors she won included an award for ''distinguished service to mathematics'' from the mathematical association.         Professor Lax was born in Kattowitz, Germany. She and her family fled Hitler's Germany in 1935 and settled in New York. She received a bachelor's degree in 1942 from Adelphi College and her doctorate in 1956.         Besides her husband of 51 years, who is also a professor of mathematics at N.Y.U., she is survived by a son, Dr. James D. Lax of Manhattan,  and three grandsons.       
         Jeanne Miles, an American painter of luminous geometric abstractions, died last Friday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 90.         Ms. Miles was born in Baltimore and grew up in Washington. She was the first woman to enroll in the art school at George Washington University. In 1937, she was given a travel grant and, determined to use it for something exotic, went to Tahiti for a year to paint. She later studied in Paris at the Atelier Marcel Gromaire and the Grand Chaumiere.  She left France after the start of World War II and came to New York, where she lived and worked in Greenwich Village for many years. She moved to Los Angeles two years ago.         Ms. Miles exhibited for many years with the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York during the gallery's  heyday, from 1943 to 1959, and counted artists like Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Bradley Walker Tomlin among her friends. More recently, she had solo shows in Manhattan at the Marilyn Pearl Gallery in 1988 and at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in 1994.         The paintings in the Shapolsky show were modest in scale, based on circular and starlike patterns done in shades of rich jade green interspersed with passages of gold leaf. Although abstract, they suggested both illuminated manuscript pages and mandalas. The work reflected both the artist's long-standing interest in Asian art and thought, and her commitment to the spiritual implications of Western modernist art. ''The mandala form is universal and deeply fixed in our psyche,'' she said in an interview.         Ms. Miles's paintings were included in many group shows from the 1930's on at the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, among other institutions. Her work is in the permanent collection of the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Guggenheim, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Newark Museum and elsewhere.         She received grants from the Yaddo Art Colony and the McDowell Art Colony, an award from the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1968, and two Mark Rothko awards, in 1970 and 1973. She taught at Oberlin College, Moravian College and Yale University.         Ms. Miles is survived by a daughter, the actress Joanna Miles; a grandson, Miles Brandman, and a sister, Kitty Daffron of Florida.       
         Marion Zimmer Bradley, a science fiction writer and the creator of the Darkover series of fantasies, died on Saturday at Alta Bates Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif. She was 69 and lived in Berkeley.         The cause was a heart attack, said Elisabeth Waters, her cousin and secretary.         Ms. Bradley rose to fame in 1958 with the publication of ''The Planet Savers,'' the first of her top-selling Darkover novels. The series eventually comprised 21 books, written almost exclusively by Ms. Bradley, which told the story of a planet discovered at the end of the 21st century  and colonized by Earth.         She later worked primarily in the fantasy genre, often adding a feminist spin to well-known myths. In 1983, she published her most famous work, ''The Mists of Avalon,'' a retelling of the legend of King Arthur  from the vantage point of its principal women, Viviane, Gwynyfar, Morgaine and Igraine. Hailed by Maureen Quilligan in The New York Times as ''a massive narrative that is rich in events placed in landscapes no less real for often being magical,'' the novel remained on The Times best-seller list for four months. In her 1987 work ''The Firebrand,'' she retold the story of the Trojan War from the perspective of the prophet  Cassandra, whom she renamed Kassandra.         Born in Albany, N.Y., Ms. Bradley began to write as a teen-ager and by the age of 17 had created a magazine for science-fiction fans. Two years later she began writing for pulp magazines. In 1964 she graduated from  Hardin-Simmons University in Abilene, Tex., and then did graduate work at the University of California at Berkeley from 1965 to 1967.         Though she continued to write until her death, Ms. Bradley's poor health in the early 1990's limited her activities. She devoted much of her time to editing magazines, including her own, Marion Zimmer Bradley's Fantasy Magazine, which she started in 1988. She also edited an annual anthology called ''Sword and Sorceress'' from Daw Books in New York.         Ms. Bradley's marriage to Robert Alden Bradley ended in divorce in 1964. She is survived by three children, David Bradley of Oakland, Calif.; Patrick Breen of Denver, and Moira Stern of Sparks, Nev.; a brother, Leslie Zimmer of East Greenbush, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Lenon Hoyte, better known as Aunt Len, who shared her dream of a doll museum with Harlem children and  collectors from around the world for two decades, died Aug. 1 at a hospital in New York. She was 94.         A public school art teacher, she  founded Aunt Len's Doll and Toy Museum, one of the most extensive private collections of dolls and related toys in the United States, and long one of New York City's choice specialty museums. She closed the museum in the early 1990's when she was no longer able to care for it.         To Ms. Hoyte, the dolls were her ''babies,'' to be loved and shown off, whether they were the rarest antiques or battered castoffs.         In 1938, Ms. Hoyte and her husband bought the three-story brownstone at 6 Hamilton Terrace between Convent and St. Nicholas Avenues.         At one time the house was home to 6,000 dolls.         There were a dozen versions of  Shirley Temple; there was Barbie, and Betsy Wetsy, presidents and their wives, and refined French dolls with bodies and faces made of  bisque, the unglazed ceramic ware used to make fine dolls in the 19th century and before.         And always, her collection included black dolls, which are now highly sought by collectors, because so few were made before the 20th century.         One rarity, described in the sale catalogue as ''a black Bru pressed-bisque-head bebe doll,'' was valued at $18,000.         There were a pair of papier-mache dolls, named Lillian and Leo, made by Leo Moss, a black handyman who lived in Atlanta in the 19th century. Both Lillian and Leo have tears running down their cheeks.         The story has it that after the dollmaker parted from his wife and children he became so sad that he made only crying dolls.         The collection also included accessories like doll houses, doll clothing and costumes, tin toys and stuffed animals.         Visitors had to squeeze their way sideways or hunch down as they progressed through the narrow passageways of the public spaces on the ground floor and in the basement of the building.         The museum had a modest entrance fee, never exceeding $2 for adults and 50 cents for children.         Visitors would encounter all manner of mannequins, ranging from thumb-size to two or three feet tall.  Not all of the collectibles were old. One of Ms. Hoyte's favorites -- a baby doll with wide eyes and long eyelashes -- was carved in mahogany in 1977 by a California artist, Patty Hale.         In 1990, soon after Mayor Edward I. Koch presented Ms. Hoyte with the Mayoral Award of Honor for Art and Culture, her genteel house and museum was broken into by thieves.         At least nine dolls, including a two-foot-tall English king, considered priceless by knowledgeable collectors, were stolen.         Ms. Hoyte was disconsolate.         ''People any more don't let you live,'' she said then. ''You struggle to keep something up for joy and beauty, and you find yourself having to watch for thieves. It's not right.''         But soon after, four of the stolen dolls -- representing George and Martha Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin -- turned up, disjointed but repairable, in Ms. Hoyte's front room. ''I don't ask questions about how,'' she said. ''I'm just happy to have them back.''         In 1994, 700 of the finest antique dolls were auctioned at Sotheby's. Thousands more had been sold previously to dealers around the country.         Lenon Holder Hoyte was born in New York City on July 4, 1905, the first of five children of Moses and Rose Holder. She attended public school in New York City and studied art at the College of the City of New York, Columbia University and with private teachers.         She taught art at Junior High School 149 in the Bronx and retired after 41 years. ''When they started killing teachers, I got out,'' she said.         Her passion for collecting dolls dated to 1962, when she was asked to organize a doll show to raise money for Harlem Hospital. After that, she began acquiring dolls from flea markets, garage sales and antiques shops that she visited throughout the United States, Europe and the Caribbean. Her collection was officially opened as a museum in 1974.         Ms. Hoyte continued to produce  doll shows, and donated the proceeds to St. Philip's Episcopal Church, where she had been a lifelong member.         She spent many of her retirement years traveling to doll shows and picking up dolls and doll accouterments for her collection.         Ms. Hoyte's husband, Lewis Hoyte, died about 30 years ago. She is survived by her brother, Dr. Oliver Holder, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., two nieces and three nephews.       
         Birgit Cullberg, a pioneering experimental choreographer in Sweden who earned an international reputation through her intense dramatic ballets and vigorous social-protest pieces, died on Wednesday in Stockholm, where she lived. She was 91.         Although Miss Cullberg was a disciple of the German Expressionist choreographer Kurt Jooss, her own style fused modern dance and ballet. She was resident choreographer of the Royal Swedish Ballet from 1951 to 1957, and her most famous works were danced by ballet companies throughout the world.         Among these was her acknowledged masterpiece, ''Miss Julie,'' based on the August Strindberg play; it had its premiere in Sweden in 1950. Restaged to great acclaim in 1958 for American Ballet Theater, ''Miss Julie'' was a triumph for Violette Verdy in the title role, as the Swedish aristocrat who seduces a butler, and for Erik Bruhn as Jean, the butler. Mr. Bruhn virtually made the role his own for 20 years through his astonishingly powerful portrayal.         Ballet Theater staged three other Cullberg works, including the haunting Lapp tale ''Moon Reindeer.'' In 1958 the New York City Ballet presented Miss Cullberg's ''Medea'' with Melissa Hayden in the title role. In his review, John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, ''There is not a superfluous phrase, a meaningless gesture, an item of mere decoration in the choreography from end to end.''         Psychological insight was Miss Cullberg's strength, as she showed again in 1982 when the Cullberg Ballet, which she founded in 1967, made its belated United States debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with  Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in attendance.         Never shy about exploring the neurotic and the erotic, Miss Cullberg was represented by a duet, ''Adam and Eve,'' and an especially sensuous performance of ''Miss Julie,'' which nonetheless focused on the class differences between Julie and her servant. In ''Adam and Eve,'' Daniela Malusardi and Niklas Ek, Miss Cullberg's elder son, moved seamlessly from innocent playfulness to adult passion, a couple expelled from Eden but rejecting God as well.         Most of the other choreography was by Mats Ek, Miss Cullberg's other son, who cast her as a Mother Africa figure in his ''Soweto.'' Miss Cullberg, then 74, came out swinging, kicking, fiery-eyed and goading the oppressed onstage to resist until they collapsed to the sound of gunshots. In 1991, with her long white hair still flying, Miss Cullberg performed in Mats Ek's television dance production ''The Old Woman and the Door.''         She excelled in choreography for television. Her duet ''Red Wine in Green Glasses'' (1970) was shown on public television in the United States and was awarded the Prix Italia.         Miss Cullberg started life in a secure, wealthy home, but she had a volatile relationship with Anders Ek, one of Sweden's leading actors, whom she married in 1942. They had three children: Niklas, a brilliant dancer; Mats, 54, and his twin, the actress Malin Ek. They survive her, as do several grandchildren.         Miss Cullberg and her husband separated in 1949, and ''Medea,'' like many of her works, was interpreted by several Swedish critics as a piece that universalized her private emotions of the time.         Miss Cullberg and her husband reconciled in 1959 and both joined the new Stockholm City Theater, she as a stage director. (She directed him in ''Othello.'') The couple eventually divorced, but in the late 1970's, after Mr. Ek's death, Miss Cullberg choreographed a meditation on their life entitled ''Dreams of Love and Death.''         Born in Nykoping, Sweden, on Aug. 3, 1908, Miss Cullberg was the daughter of Ella W. Cullberg and Carl Cullberg, a bank director, and attended the University of Stockholm. After Jooss, the choreographer of the celebrated antiwar ballet ''The Green Table,'' appeared with his company in Stockholm, Miss Cullberg spent four years in England studying with him at Dartington Hall, an experimental arts center.         Returning to Sweden in 1939, she formed a small company and danced solos inspired by animal movements. In the early 1940's she studied ballet and wrote dance criticism. In 1946 she and the choreographer Ivo Cramer formed the Swedish Dance Theater, which disbanded in 1948. As the Royal Swedish Ballet's resident choreographer, she staged eight ballets.         In 1967 the Swedish Government established the current Cullberg Ballet. Writing in 1982 the Swedish critic Erik Naslund paid tribute to Miss Cullberg by declaring that it was her troupe, not the Royal Swedish Ballet, that was ''definitely the more prestigious company.''       
         Emily Solis Nathan, a journalist who later became a public relations executive specializing in art and museum projects in New York, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         Miss Nathan was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Adelphi University and received a master's degree in journalism from Columbia University in 1929. She wrote for The Bronx Home News, The New York Sun, The Sun-World Telegram and WOR radio.         Just before World War II she began a career in public relations and eventually started a firm with Helen Erskine. Her clients included the Archives of American Art, the National Portrait Gallery and the New-York Historical Society. During the war she helped organize art exhibitions to benefit the American Friends of France and the Free French. Her first at the Metropolitan Museum of Art was an exhibition of British and American cartoons, a wartime benefit for the English Speaking Union. It was the second exhibition of cartoons at the Metropolitan.         Miss Nathan is survived by two nieces and two nephews.       
         Frances Knight, who ran the United States Passport Office for 22 years with efficiency and conservative zeal, denying passports and entrance visas to those she regarded as enemies of the nation and surviving efforts to remove her and even mandatory retirement at 70, died on Sept. 11 in a hospital in Bethesda, Md. She was 94.         Frances Knight Parrish, who used her maiden name of Knight while working at the State Department rather than her married name, lived at the Carriage Hill Bethesda nursing home in Bethesda, Md., for the last three years.         The conviction that guided Ms. Knight as she supervised the Passport Office was that the Government had a legal right and moral responsibility to protect American citizens from ideas and philosophies she found abhorrent, especially Communism. To people who represented such forces, she denied passports and visas, and sometimes, when she was not permitted to do so by her superiors in the State Department, she went over their heads and complained to Congress.         Ms. Knight inherited her sense of mission, she said, from her predecessor, Ruth Shipley, a staunch conservative who ran the office with unchallenged authority and who hand-picked Ms. Knight as her successor in 1955. She served until 1977, when she was 72.         Ms. Knight's convictions and fearlessness attracted powerful friends and allies like J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. Director, and powerful members of Congress like Representative Francis E. Walter of Pennsylvania, who headed the House Un-American Activities Committee and the Subcommittee on Immigration and Naturalization.         She drew fire from liberals who accused her of practicing thought control and perpetuating many of the strict travel regulations imposed in the most bitter days of the cold war.         But Ms. Knight won praise from both conservatives and liberals for running a highly efficient agency at a time when Americans were traveling overseas in previously unimaginable numbers.         In a 1960 interview, she said, ''I was determined to prove that a Government agency could be made efficient; that business management and standards could be instituted and sustained; that Government employees could provide the public with interested, friendly and personalized public service.''         Ms. Knight was also outspoken on equal rights for women. She often complained about the lack of women in high-ranking management positions in the State Department.         She raised a furor in Congress in 1963 when it came to light that she had told a closed meeting of the Senate Internal Security subcommittee that she had been ordered by Secretary of State Dean Rusk to approve passport applications by ''dangerous undercover Communists engaged in espionage, sabotage and sedition.''         She testified that Mr. Rusk's order and departmental regulations ''in effect forbids us to protect ourselves,'' and she questioned ''whether there exists the will'' to defend the country from ''the inroads of Communism.''         In 1966, Abba P. Schwartz, the liberal-minded head of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs, a Kennedy appointee, tried unsuccessfully to force her to resign because of their political differences.         Ms. Knight called a news conference in which she declared: ''Some creeps are out to get me.''         She also sought the help of J. Edgar Hoover and powerful members of Congress, and in the end it was Mr. Schwartz who was forced to resign.         After that, her critics in Congress referred to her as ''the ogress'' and the columnist Mary McGrory likened Ms. Knight to Senator Joseph R. McCarthy.         But her friends in Congress twice permitted her to remain on the job at the Passport Office after she had reached mandatory retirement age.         Ms. Knight was born in Newport, R.I., and grew up in New York City. She attended Hunter College and New York University. She moved to Washington when her husband, Wayne Parrish, a magazine publisher, was offered the editorship of a Washington-based aviation magazine.         Mr. Parrish soon became a multimillionaire and the couple lived on Embassy Row in Washington.         He later started his own publication, with his wife dealing with the bookkeeping and circulation.         Mr. Parrish died in 1984. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Irene Heskes, a historian and author who specialized in sacred and secular Jewish music, including music of the Yiddish theater, died on Thursday at Long Island Jewish Hospital. She was 76 and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         The cause was aplastic anemia, said Dr. Alan M. Kraut, her son-in-law.         Ms. Heskes was born in Brooklyn and studied music and history at New York University, voice and piano at the Juilliard School, music education at the Eastman School of Music and arts administration at Harvard. She completed her studies of Jewish music at the School of Sacred Music at Hebrew Union College and the Cantors Institute at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         Because she studied cantorial music in the 1950's, long before cantorial positions were available to women, Ms. Heskes worked as a researcher, writer and lecturer for the Theodor Herzl Institute of the Jewish Agency from 1964 to 1976. She was also the director of the National Jewish Music Council from 1968 to 1980 and a consultant to the American Jewish Historical Society and to libraries and academic institutions.         In 1980 Ms. Heskes founded the American Yiddish Theater Music Restoration and Revival Project. Under her direction the project assembled, catalogued and microfilmed a comprehensive collection of Yiddish theater music, which is now available for study at the Library of Congress. In 1992 the library published Ms. Heskes's annotated catalogue and resource book based on the collection.         Ms. Heskes also wrote extensively about Jewish music for academic publications and Jewish newspapers and magazines, and she wrote several books that covered the expanse of Jewish composition, including ''The Cantorial Art'' (1966); ''Ernest Bloch: Creative Spirit,'' with Suzanne Bloch, the composer's daughter (1976); ''The Resource Book of Jewish Music'' (1985); ''The Music of Abraham Goldfaden: Father of the Yiddish Theater'' (1990); ''Yiddish American Popular Songs, 1895 to 1950'' (1992), and ''Passport to Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions and Culture'' (1994). At the time of her death she was working on another book, ''Yiddish-American Music: Melodies of Immigration, Acculturation and Assimilation.''         Ms. Heskes is survived by her husband, Jacob Heskes; a daughter, Deborah Aviva Kraut of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Walter Morris Heskes of Edison, N.J., a granddaughter and two grandsons.         Correction:  October 20, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary yesterday about Irene Heskes, an author and music historian, omitted a survivor. He is her brother, Lawrence Newman of Niskayuna, N.Y.       
         Nathalie Sarraute, the Russian-born French novelist who remained an influential and innovative literary figure long after she first gained fame as the doyenne of the Nouveau Roman movement in the late 1950's, died today at her home in Paris. She was 99 and also had a country home in Cherence in Normandy.         In a writing career that lasted more than six decades, Mrs. Sarraute published 17 books, including 10 novels, although in her very first book, ''Tropisms,'' she already set the tone of her life's work. She took the book's title from the biological term for the involuntary reaction of plants to external stimuli and used it to describe the human impulses that precede gestures or words.         All her subsequent books can be understood through the prism of these tropisms, which she once described as ''the interior movements that prepare our words and actions at the limits of our consciousness.'' On another occasion, she spoke of her writing as ''sub-conversation'' through which she captured and conveyed half-formed ideas and feelings in often hesitant dialogue.         While ''tropisms'' became her tool for exploring the human spirit, her purpose was to break with the 19th-century novel of Balzac and Flaubert, which in her view, had been made obsolete by Kafka, Proust, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. She considered these writers to be her mentors, but she went further, creating a stark literary form stripped of characters, plot and chronology, a form that Jean-Paul Sartre tagged the ''antinovel.''         ''I believe that, through my novels, I showed that it was possible to write novels where the purely fictional element was freed from the conventions that encumbered it, just as the purely pictorial element in painting has freed itself from subject matter, perspective, and so on,'' Mrs. Sarraute wrote in an essay in The New York Times Book Review in 1964.         In the 1950's, her innovative approach drew her toward several young French writers, among them Alain Robbe-Grillet, Michel Butor, Marguerite Duras, Claude Simon, and Robert Pinget, who came to be identified with the Nouveau Roman (a term borrowed from a critic for Le Monde). But while she enjoyed being discovered as a ''new novelist'' when she was already well into her 50's, her attacks on traditional literary form both anticipated and survived the movement.         Born into an intellectual Jewish family in Ivanovo, Russia, on July 18, 1900, Natasha Tcherniak -- as she then was -- had an unsettling childhood. Her father, Elie, a chemist, and her mother, Pauline, a writer, separated when she was 2 and remarried,  and she was painfully shuttled back and forth between two countries and two sets of parents. She went to Paris with her mother in 1902, moved to St. Petersburg in 1905 and then returned to Paris in 1908, where she was then brought up by her father and his new wife, Vera.         Soon fluent in German and English as well as French and Russian, she  studied law and literature at the Sorbonne and Oxford University before joining a Paris law firm in 1925, the same year that she married a fellow lawyer, Raymond Sarraute. After Germany occupied France in 1940, she escaped the fate of 76,000 Jews who were deported from France to German death camps by hiding out in a village and posing as Nicole Sauvage, the governess of her own three young daughters.         She never returned to the Paris bar. In 1932, she had begun writing ''Tropisms,'' a book comprising 24 short sketches. She finished five years later, but it was not until 1939 that she found a publisher. After the war, dedicating herself entirely to writing, she became friends with Sartre, who offered to write a preface for her first novel, ''Portrait of a  Man Unknown'' (1948), which he famously described as ''an antinovel that reads like a detective story.'' He noted, ''Nathalie Sarraute has a horror of the tricks of the novelist.''         Although Mrs. Sarraute was not drawn to existentialism, she remained friends with Sartre until Simone de Beauvoir came between them. ''She separated us completely,'' Mrs. Sarraute recalled in a 1990 interview with The Paris Review. ''But I heard that she couldn't bear Sartre having an intellectual relationship with anyone, male or female.''         Like many French writers then and now, Mrs. Sarraute liked to work at a table in a cafe, in her case one at the Trocadero near her home in the 16th arrondissement. In his memoir ''Paris in the Fifties,'' the American journalist and author Stanley Karnow, who was briefly married to Mrs. Sarraute's eldest daughter, Claude, paints a portrait of the writer as ''a lean, severe-looking woman with a hawk nose, piercing black eyes and combed-back ebony hair.''         At one point, Mr. Karnow recalled, he moved in with his wife's parents, although he was unsure whether Mrs. Sarraute's ''unpredictable Slavic temperament'' would prove too much. ''She could be uptight and relaxed, cantankerous and amiable, dour and cheerful,'' he wrote. ''Even so, I adored her -- or perhaps it was the intellectual electricity of her company.'' Mrs. Sarraute is survived by her daughter Claude and two other daughters, Anne and Dominique.         In her second novel, ''Martereau'' (1953), Mrs. Sarraute used the natural intrigue of an extended family to explore her tropisms. The book sold few copies, but it sufficed to identify her as a ''new novelist.'' Just three years later, when she published ''The Age of Suspicion,'' this book of essays about her approach to literature was presented to the public as ''the first theoretical manifestation of the Nouveau Roman school.''         Mrs. Sarraute was not prolific. After she published ''The Planetarium'' in 1959, it would take more than a decade for her to complete her next three novels -- ''The Golden Fruits'' (1963), ''Between Life and Death'' (1968) and ''Do You Hear Them?'' (1972) -- which had in common a complex and humorous self-criticism of her own creative process hidden inside a novel.         Quintessentially French in its intellectual playfulness, ''The Golden Fruits'' revolved around a discussion of the merits and demerits of an imaginary, much-acclaimed book, also called ''The Golden Fruits,'' a discussion that enabled Mrs. Sarraute to demystify the solemn language of literary criticism through parody and caricature while, at the same time, raising disturbing questions. ''It is my most abstract work,'' she said at the time.         Well received in France, ''The Golden Fruits'' appeared obscure to some American critics. ''The fact that this misty book contains some valid satirical points does not make it a rewarding novel,'' Orville Prescott wrote in The New York Times in February 1964. ''When the experimental techniques shrink the size of fiction and squeeze the juices of life out of it, they are fruitless indeed.''         Albeit eliminating even the narrator from some of her books (in which characters may be reduced to ''he,'' ''she'' and ''they''), Mrs. Sarraute was in fact always present as a form of mischievous puppeteer. In her 1983 autobiographical work, ''Childhood,'' however, she showed herself, at least how she remembered her turbulent first 12 years of life. And, typically, she recalled them through the impact of single words, like ''stupid'' and ''tragedy.''         ''Childhood'' was written in her ''predialogue'' style, which she defined as the ''little bits of something still alive'' on the border of consciousness, ''something prior to language -- a sensation, a perception.'' These feelings, she said, must be captured before they're labeled with adult words because adult words both falsify experience and render it traumatizing.         ''Childhood'' was adapted as a one-act play and presented in New York with Glenn Close. But it was less successful than several pieces that she wrote as radio plays and that were later staged, among them ''The Lie'' and ''Silence.'' In writing for theater, she was also forced to become more explicit. In novels, she said, the dialogue skimmed the surface of the sub-conversation. But in plays, the ''predialogue'' became a fully fledged dialogue. ''They later said my plays, in relation to my novels, were like a glove turned inside out,'' she told The Paris Review.         Slowing down in the mid-1980's after the death of her husband, Mrs. Sarraute nonetheless never stopped writing, occasionally demonstrating that she remained as fascinated with her explorations of language as she had been a half-century or more earlier. ''You Don't Love Yourself,'' published in 1990, is a dialogue about self-hate in which, as often is the case, there is a counterpoint between language and emotion.         ''Here,'' published in 1995 in France and in 1997 in the United States, just as Mrs. Sarraute's complete works were being reissued in France's legendary Pleiade Series, is as always a novel without plot or characters or perhaps, as suggested by Richard Burgin writing in The Washington Post, ''a poetic essay of ideas'' in which the author pursues ''the power and poverty of words.''         In France, ''Here'' was described by some critics as Mrs. Sarraute's final testimony, an apt summation of her oeuvre. But she had not yet finished. In September 1997, at the age of 97, she published ''Ouvrez,'' or ''Open,'' a 130-page book in which she denounced the impoverishment of the French language. ''It seems completely mad,'' she remarked in one interview, ''but at my age one is allowed to write things that are completely mad.'' And, unsurprisingly, she was working on yet another book at the time of her death.       
         Maria Ley Piscator, a theater arts teacher and director and the widow of the theatrical director Erwin Piscator, died on Oct. 14 at the Jewish Home and Hospital for the Aged in Manhattan. She was 101.         Born in Vienna, Ms. Piscator began her theatrical career as a dancer in Berlin and Paris and later turned to choreography. She helped stage several productions with Max Reinhardt, including his renowned production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.''         She met Piscator, her third husband, in 1936 while studying for a doctorate in literature at the Sorbonne. The two immigrated to the United States and founded the Dramatic Workshop at the New School for Social Research in Manhattan. Their students included Stella Adler, Harry Belafonte, Marlon Brando, Tony Randall and Anthony Franciosa.         Ms. Piscator also directed theatrical productions off Broadway and in Europe and was the director and founder of small theater programs in New York for the elderly, children and others. Her teaching also included work in the 1970's at the University of Southern Illinois at Carbondale and at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. She began working with the Elysium Theater Company of Munich in the 1980's and in 1993 became the honorary artistic director of Elysium -- Between Two Continents, a Munich-based organization devoted to cultural exchange between the United State and Europe, particularly Germany.         Ms. Piscator wrote books including ''The Piscator Experiment: The Political Theater,'' which was published by James H. Heineman in 1967, a year after her husband's death. Her autobiography, ''Mirror People,'' was published in 1989.       
         Wendy Scott, who had one of the most severe cases on record of a syndrome in which people feign illness or make themselves sick to get medical treatment, died on Oct. 14 at a hospice in South London. She was 50.         The cause was intestinal cancer, said Mary Jane Lang, a friend of Miss Scott.         Miss Scott, who lived in London, spent 12 years traveling from one hospital to another in Britain and elsewhere in Europe, pretending to be ill so that she could become a patient. She was admitted to hundreds of hospitals and underwent 42 operations, nearly all of them unnecessary.         Remarkably, Miss Scott recovered from the condition, called Munchausen syndrome, which many doctors consider untreatable.         In an interview in The New York Times on July 20, Miss Scott said she had not faked her way into a hospital in 20 years. She credited her devotion to a pet with helping her recover. She became so attached to a kitten that she gave up hospitals for fear the kitten would be neglected in her absence.         In recent years, she tried to help other people with Munchausen syndrome, communicating with them by mail, telephone and Internet. She also approached Dr. Marc Feldman, a psychiatrist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham and an expert on Munchausen syndrome, who said she had helped a number of patients.         In the last year, Ms. Scott became increasingly ill but had difficulty obtaining medical care in London because of her notorious record. While visiting Miss Lang in the United States last summer, she sought help from Dr. Feldman, whose colleagues in Birmingham discovered that she had advanced intestinal cancer.         Miss Scott remained in the hospital in Birmingham until last month, and then returned to London.         Miss Scott was born in 1948 in Wemyss, in the Fife region of Scotland near the North Sea. Information about survivors was not available.       
         Barbara Wolff, a veteran New York City official who was instrumental in setting up the city's business improvement districts program and in the commercial revitalization program that followed the blackout of 1977, died Oct. 15 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 58.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said George Glatter, a friend and colleague, who said Ms. Wolff had kept coming to her office until several weeks ago.         Ms. Wolff was assistant commissioner in charge of the neighborhood development division of the New York City Department of Business Services, a job she had held for more than a decade. The division develops and oversees economic programs designed to benefit neighborhood commercial streets, industrial areas and other economic centers in the city.         In that post and for some years earlier she played a leading role in creating the business improvement districts known as B.I.D.'s, which now number more than 40. They are self-financing organizations directed by local property owners and businesses. The districts offer a variety of services, including sanitation, security, promotion and marketing. The services are tailored to each district's needs and supplement the services the city provides.         The biggest districts include those for the Lower Manhattan, Grand Central and Times Square areas. The smallest are strips of commercial establishments in neighborhoods like the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn and the Steinway Street area of Queens.         The program has been credited with strengthening many commercial areas and some industrial ones by helping attract new businesses and persuading others to stay.         From 1977 to 1983, Ms. Wolff was with the city's Office for Economic Development as its director of commercial revitalization. Mr. Glatter, a deputy assistant commissioner in the business services department, said Ms. Wolff had directed the program, begun as a response to the damage inflicted on stores around the city in the looting that took place during the 1977 blackout.         The program has made use of Federal and city funds over the years to provide various kinds of aid to local businesses and groups.         Ms. Wolff was born in Manhattan and graduated from Hunter High School. She received a bachelor's degree from Simmons College in Boston and a master's degree in political science from the University of California at Berkeley.         She also worked for the International Labor Organization in Geneva, the United States Agency for International Development in Washington, the Parks and City Planning departments in New York and the City's Public Development Corporation, where she was a vice president.         She is survived by a brother, William Wolff of Los Angeles.         Correction:  October 27, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary yesterday about Barbara Wolff, a New York City official who was instrumental in setting up the city's business improvement districts, misstated the date of her death. It was this past Friday, not Oct. 15.       
         Ginette Lesley Harrison, an outstanding alpinist, was lost in an avalanche on Sunday on one of the most treacherous Himalayan mountains.  She was 41.         A British-born physician who specialized in high-altitude medicine, Dr. Harrison was part of an 11-member international expedition scaling Dhaulagiri in central Nepal, at 26,795 feet the world's seventh highest mountain. She was lost on her final ascent after two teammates had reached the summit; a sherpa on another expedition was killed in the same avalanche.         Her death was reported at Dhaulagiri base camp by her husband, Gary Scott Pfisterer, the American leader of the team.         The couple met in 1993 on Mount Everest, when they walked to the summit hand in hand. They recently moved to his hometown in Massachusetts, Monson.         Dr. Harrison earned her medical degree at Bristol University and trained in high-altitude and wilderness medicine at the University of Colorado. Besides her husband, her survivors include her parents, Brenda and Douglas Harrison, of Saltash, Cornwall.       
         Carol Berlin Manzoni, a Chicago lawyer whose knack for recruiting clients propelled her rapid rise in the legal profession, died on Oct. 9 at her home in Chicago. She was 52.         The cause was heart disease, the Blake-Lamb Funeral Home said.         Ms. Manzoni was a leading player at Ross & Hardie, a Chicago-based firm with about 180 lawyers and offices in Washington and Manhattan. She specialized in cases involving labor and employment, litigations and higher education law, and was known for her energetic leadership style.         She was a senior partner in the firm and served two consecutive terms as co-chairwoman of its executive committee from 1995 to 1998. A colleague at Ross & Hardie, Richard E. Lieberman, said she would probably have been in line for a third turn as co-chairwoman next year.         Ms. Manzoni's swift professional rise began when few sizable law firms counted women among their policy makers. She joined Ross & Hardie in 1989, bringing with her enough clients to become an instant equity partner.         Ms. Manzoni, a native New Yorker, received a bachelor's degree from Bucknell University in 1969 and a doctorate in law from Catholic University of America in 1977. She recalled that when she first presented herself at law firms, her interviewers usually assumed she was applying for a secretary's job.         She handled sexual discrimination suits for a Chicago firm for a year, as she told The New York Times in 1996, ''writing briefs for senior partners, and fuming a lot.'' Then, at a party, she met the president of a local college who opened the way for her to give labor seminars and thereby build her reputation.         Ms. Manzoni is survived by her husband, Michael G. Hron; two stepsons, Benjamin and Jonathan, and a sister, Susan Klimpl, also of Chicago.       
         Lee Lozano, an eccentric artist who pursued Conceptual Art and painting in the 1960's and then left the New York art world for self-imposed exile that included an embargo on contact with other women, died on Oct. 2 in the Dallas Health and Rehabilitation Center in Texas.  She was 68 and lived in Dallas.         The cause was cervical cancer, said Mark Kramer, the artist's cousin.         Ms. Lozano was a quixotic, confounding rebel whose decadelong New York career seemed always to involve pushing one limit or another. Her early paintings, executed in an Expressionistic cartoon style, confronted issues of sexual and painterly decorum. They featured a robust messiness, distorted close-ups of the body, intimations of violence and suggestively exaggerated images of tools.         By 1967 she had taken the systemic approach of Minimalism, making nearly monochromatic ''Wave'' paintings based on wavelengths that pushed the limits of visual perception. In the mid-1960's she also began to execute a series of life-related actions (she didn't like the word performance) that tested, among other things, her stamina, her friends' patience and the conduct of everyday life. These works reflected her friendship with Conceptually inclined artists like Sol LeWitt, Hollis Frampton, Dan Graham and Carl Andre. They also reflected an increasing disenchantment with the art world that bordered on hostility.         Many of these pieces were proposed or recorded in written works that she considered drawings. Sometimes she designated everyday activities like thought, conversation or marijuana smoking as art, attracted by the idea that they were unsaleable and democratic. Her ''Throw-Up Piece'' proposed throwing the 10 most recent issues of Artforum, the leading magazine of contemporary art, in the air and letting them fall where they may. In ''Transistor Radio Piece'' she listened to a radio while attending a panel discussion on art.         In 1969 and 1970 Ms. Lozano began a steady withdrawal from the art world in works that she titled ''General Strike Piece'' and ''Dropout Piece.'' She decided to boycott women for a month or two as a means of improving communication with them. For unexplained reasons, she continued this piece to the end of her life, despite the great inconvenience and, one supposes, even greater rudeness.         Ms. Lozano was born Lee Knastner in Newark in 1930. She received a B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1951 and studied painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. A brief marriage in the late 1950's to an architect, Adrian Lozano, ended in divorce. She leaves no survivors.         Ms. Lozano had her first exhibition at the Bianchini Gallery in New York in 1966 and was then associated with the Green Gallery. In 1998 her work, long absent from the New York scene, returned when three SoHo galleries, Mitchell Algus, Rosen & Van Liere and Margarete Roeder, each showed a different phase of her painting. At the same time the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford exhibited her ''Wave'' paintings and notebooks. All the dealers and curators involved with these exhibitions were men.       
         Mary C. Weitzman, who was a chorus girl as a teenager, a college freshman at 35, later a professor and finally a respected medical researcher, died on Saturday at a Manhattan hospital. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan.         As a researcher at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, she worked on isolating microscopic samples of endocrine hormones from the eyestalks of Bermuda land crabs, some of which she captured herself. The work provided evidence for the once radical but now established theory that nerves secrete hormones in small but extremely influential quantities.         Until a year ago, Dr. Weitzman was still taking two subways and a bus to work each day from her Upper West Side apartment. It was the last leg of a journey that began in Norfolk, Va., where she was born in 1914 to two poor Eastern European immigrants. She dropped out of high school to dance in a chorus line, much to the delight of her father, a frustrated vaudevillian.         She married J. Daniel Weitzman, an investor and art collector, who made headlines in the 1970's when more than $400,000 of his artworks were stolen from his home by three gunmen who left him bound and gagged.         The Weitzmans were involved in the early stages of the civil rights movement, even before it was generally called that, and in 1948 they opened the Dupont Theater, the first desegregated theater in Washington.         Because of the Weitzmans' politics, the American Legion picketed the theater and Hollywood distributors cut off the supply of films. The Dupont therefore came to specialize in foreign and avant-garde films. Chess tables and espresso added to the bohemian atmosphere.         In 1949, the Weitzmans, neither of whom had graduated from high school, enrolled at George Washington University. Mr. Weitzman dropped out because of a business deal. Mrs. Weitzman went on to earn a master's degree.         In 1957, the couple moved to New York City when Mrs. Weitzman was accepted by Einstein's doctoral program, which at the time was jointly administered by Columbia University. She received her doctorate in 1963, staying on to join the Einstein anatomy department.         For years, she single-handedly published Bibliographica Neuroendocrinologica, an abstract of the world's research in her field. Colleagues said that part of her motivation was to spread new findings to third world countries. She personally translated articles from German, French, Spanish and Russian.         Her research was done with two other Einstein scientists, Berta and Ernst Scharrer, who are often credited as founders of endocrinology, which describes how hormones control the nervous system.         The Weitzmans were divorced in 1962. Mr. Weitzman died in 1980.         Dr. Weitzman is survived by two sons, Donald, of Brookline, Mass., and David, of Orinda, Calif.; a sister, Frances Pasmanick of Washington; two brothers, Harold Cohen of Arlington, Va., and Norman Cohen of Venice, Calif.; and five grandchildren.         Dr. Weitzman's impact was as much human as scientific, said Sam Seifter, a professor of biochemistry at Einstein. She worked with students one-to-one in the laboratory, devoted herself to helping minority students, and often counseled students on personal problems.         Sometimes, in the anatomy department's lunchroom, her colorful past would return when she burst into song; she favored old-time show tunes, the Loyalist songs of the Spanish Civil War and the anthems of the civil rights movement.       
         Dr. Naomi Bluestone, a medical writer, a practitioner, a teacher and a ''Dear Abby'' to a generation of aspiring doctors, died Nov. 13 at her home in Center Barnstead, N.H. She was 63 and had moved there from Great Neck, N.Y., in 1991.         The cause was chronic lymphocytic leukemia, said her husband, Robert Press.         Dr. Bluestone wrote about 200 articles in professional as well as lay journals. She wrote a book, ''So You Want to Be a Doctor?'' (William Morrow, 1981), for college students contemplating medical careers and fielded the question with humor and satire.         Her main interests were in social and public health and psychiatry, and she continued to write about them to the end. Until two years ago, her general psychiatric practice in Center Barnstead drew patients from near and far.         Born in Wilmington, Del., she graduated from the University of Delaware with an English major. Changing course, she graduated from Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1962 and trained in psychiatry in New York in the 1980's.         In between, Dr. Bluestone held teaching and administrative posts in New York at Mount Sinai Hospital, Bird S. Coler Memorial Hospital and Montefiore Hospital. She was also  the city's assistant commissioner of health for chronic and long-term care in the 1970's.         She wrote on many issues confronting American medicine, particularly those affecting women as doctors and patients. Dr. Bluestone also helped organize national conferences and seminars on the challenges for female doctors and the special problems of female patients.         She wrote columns for such publications as The New Physician, Medical Dimensions and Resident and Staff Physician. As an editor she was associated with The New York State Journal of Medicine and The Journal of Community Health.         ''I was getting letters from medical students,'' Dr. Bluestone said in an interview after her book was published, ''and the medical students would pour their hearts out to me to the point where I was starting to feel like the Dear Abby of the medical profession.''         She said some asked advice about the dictatorial atmosphere of hospitals and the terror and loneliness of internship, adding, ''The women, in particular, wrote to me about sexism, discrimination, problems juggling career, home, family, husband.''       
         Gladys Yang, a British translator who spent most of her life in China, translating and promoting Chinese literature for foreign readers, died Thursday in Beijing, the official New China News Agency reported. She was 80.         ''After such famous translators from Chinese as Arthur Waley and James Legge of an earlier generation, Gladys Yang was No. 1,'' said Perry Link, a professor of modern Chinese language and literature at Princeton University.         ''She ran the gamut -- going as far back as China's classical period in the 5th century B.C., through later imperial works in the 7th through 19th centuries, and on to the moderns,'' Professor Link said.         Mrs. Yang was born in Beijing in 1919 to British parents and moved to Britain with them when she was 4. . She graduated in 1940 from St. Anne's College at Oxford University, the college's first student to receive a bachelor's degree in Chinese literature, the official newspaper China Daily reported.         She married a fellow Oxford student, Yang Xianyi, and the couple returned to China, where she taught for a while in Chongqing, China's wartime capital. After the Communist takeover in 1949, the Yangs began careers in Beijing devoted to translating Chinese literature for the Foreign Languages Press, the magazine Chinese Literature and other publishing houses.         Among Mrs. Yang's major translations was ''The Selected Stories of Lu Xun'' (Foreign Languages Press, 1960) by one of the foremost Chinese writers of the early 20th century.         Mrs. Yang's relationship to the Communist government was at times tense, although in general she and her husband occupied a privileged position.         In the mid-1950s, Mrs. Yang translated ''Keep the Red Flag Flying'' (China Youth Publishing House, 1957) by Liang Bin, a pro-Communist socialist realist novel; she expressed no reservations about the propagandistic nature of the work.         Like many foreign intellectuals living in China during the tumultuous Cultural Revolution, from 1966 to 1976, Mrs. Yang was persecuted and jailed. In the hope of sparing their son from the worst excesses of the period, the Yangs sent him to London. Once there, he committed suicide by burning down the house he was living in.         After the Beijing massacre of 1989, when troops moved in to suppress the pro-democracy demonstrations in Tiananmen Square, Mrs. Yang and her husband gave a joint television interview deploring the brutality of the government's actions. But they did not leave Beijing or publicly disavow Communism. ''She clung to it the way someone holds on to a stock that falls in value,'' said Professor Link, who knew Mrs. Yang. ''She kept hoping that it would rise again.''       
         Regina Shoolman Slatkin, a dealer in old master drawings and a writer and specialist on the 18th-century French painter Francois Boucher, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 92 and had homes in Manhattan, Essex, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla.         Born in what was Austria-Hungary and reared in Quebec, Mrs. Slatkin graduated from McGill University. She went to Paris on a French government fellowship to study at the Sorbonne and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and became interested in French art. She also studied at the University of Chicago.         When she returned to Canada she worked as a journalist on The Montreal Star and for the Jewish Welfare Board. She also published poetry and collaborated with the ethnologist Marius Barbeau on a government-sponsored project, later made into a book, to collect and translate the folk songs of Quebec.         In 1936 she married Charles E. Slatkin, a New York schoolteacher, and moved to Manhattan. Mr. Slatkin worked as a liaison between the public schools and the city museums from an office at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mrs. Slatkin worked as an editor and for several years as executive director of the Iranian Institute of Art and Archaeology.         In 1959 the couple opened a gallery in their apartment on East 92nd Street that specialized in old master drawings and Impressionist painting and sculpture. Their exhibitions were often accompanied by scholarly publications, like the 1962 show of Rodin's sculptures and watercolors whose catalog included essays by Leo Steinberg and Albert Elsen.         Mrs. Slatkin, who published numerous articles on Boucher in Burlington magazine and other journals, was instrumental in organizing the National Gallery of Art's 1974 exhibition of Boucher drawings, the first major show of its kind in North America, for which she wrote the catalog introduction and entries. With her husband she wrote ''The Enjoyment of Art in America'' (1947) and ''Six Centuries of French Master Drawings in America'' (1950). Her last article, ''A Note on a Boucher Drawing,'' was written and published in Master Drawings magazine in 1996.         After her husband's death in 1977 Mrs. Slatkin became interested in the decorative arts, building a collection of early-American glass that she donated to the State University of New York at Plattsburgh. She also donated 19th- and 20th-century prints.         Mrs. Slatkin is survived by two daughters, Carole Slatkin of Plattsburgh and Laura Slatkin of Chicago.       
         Charlotte Perriand, the French designer who created furniture with Le Corbusier in the 1920's and 30's and was rediscovered as a modernist legend in her own right in the 1980's and 90's, died at her home in Paris on Oct. 27. She was 96.         Through a productive career spanning eight decades, Ms. Perriand designed tubular ''equipment for living'' with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, bamboo furniture in Japan, lobbies for Air France in London and Tokyo, workers' housing in the Sahara and ski resort interiors in the French Alps.         Her ideas about flexible space, free-form shapes, natural materials and furniture designed to make ''space sing'' made her a modernist with a humanist agenda. The legs on her dining table were splayed, for example, so that people sitting at the ends could stretch their legs.         Preferring to be known as an interior architect instead of a furniture designer, Ms. Perriand subscribed to the modernist notion that furnishings and architecture needed to be developed as a single entity.         Her collaborations were often especially productive. The primary-colored bookcase with cupboards painted by Sonia Delaunay for the dormitory for Tunisian students at the Cite Universitaire in Paris and the lighting table (table and fluorescent overhead lights in one) she designed with Jean Prouve in 1953 are prized by collectors and sometimes reproduced without authorization.         ''For nearly three quarters of a century, Perriand has been one of the major innovators in French design, and her career embraces much of the history of 20th-century design in France,'' said Mary McLeod, an architectural historian at Columbia University.         Ms. Perriand was born in Paris on Oct. 24, 1903. Her early talent for drawing led her to the Ecole de l'Union Central des Arts Decoratifs. By 1926 she had been selected to exhibit her work at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs, from which the name of the Art Deco movement derives.         Her ''bar under the roof,'' an installation featuring a built-in chrome-walled bar counter and card table with pool-pocket drink holders, caused a sensation at the 1927 Salon d'Automne and established her as an avant-garde talent to watch.         Believing that she had nowhere to go but to the top, as she told Roger Aujame, a friend and former Corbusier Foundation director who is working on a catalog of her works, Ms. Perriand sought a job at Le Corbusier's studio. His initial withering response, ''We don't embroider cushions here,'' has become part of modernist lore. But once he went to see her bar installation, Le Corbusier hired her on the spot.         The years from 1927 to 1937 that she spent working with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret were formative and soon, like Corbusier, Ms. Perriand was making manifesto-style declarations about ''the new man'' and wearing her signature necklace of steel ball bearings. But it was her love of nature, especially the mountains where she often retreated, and her pragmatism that tempered the strict angularities of their furniture classics like the chaise longue and the famous cube-shaped Grand Confort chair.         In 1940 Ms. Perriand was invited to Japan, where she used traditional materials like bamboo, pine and woven straw to make modern shapes. When war broke out, she moved to Vietnam; unable to get a return visa to France, she worked for the colonial government. There she met Jacques Martin, a local official, whom she married in 1943. (An earlier, brief marriage in 1926 ended in divorce.) The couple had one daughter in 1944, Pernette Perriand, now an architect in Paris. Mr. Martin died in 1986.         Ms. Perriand returned to Paris in 1946 and was soon working on a wide range of projects, from ski resorts to student housing. Fiercely independent, she rejected frequent requests to furnish interiors designed by other architects. But she was eager to work with Mr. Prouve, the designer and manufacturer who collaborated with her and produced several of her designs from 1951 to 1953. She also collaborated again with Le Corbusier on the Unite d'Habitation housing project in Marseilles.         Ms. Perriand continued to travel to Japan and Brazil for inspiration, but spent much of her time from 1967 to 1982 working on the Arcs, a vast compound of ski resorts in the Alps.         In the 1980's the retrospectives of her work began, first at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in 1985 and then at the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Design Museum in London in 1996 and the Architectural League in Manhattan in 1997. But Ms. Perriand looked ahead, not back, and at the time of her death was exploring the possibilities of new materials for the 21st century.         At a league lecture, Ms. Perriand told the young design students there, ''We are leaving the age of oak and entering a period that will be defined by lightness, suppleness and the ephemeral.''

         Eve F. Kraft, a tennis teacher, coach, author and the founder and former executive director of the Education and Research Committee of the United States Tennis Association, died Thursday at Princeton Hospital.         She was 73 years old and lived in Princeton, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         Kraft began giving tennis lessons to her children and their friends on a court behind her house in 1955 and was soon teaching the fundamentals to thousands of amateur players through the Princeton Community Tennis Program.         Bill Talbert, the legendary doubles and singles champion, once described the program as ''a leader in the field in developing new materials and experimenting with new ways to teach tennis in group situations.''         Kraft, an enthusiast who kept the notes from her first tennis lesson at age 12, wrote ''The Tennis Workbook,'' a learning and practice guide for beginners, and ''The Tennis Teacher's Guide to Group Instruction and Community Tennis Programming.''         In 1971, when Princeton University first admitted women, Kraft became the women's varsity tennis coach, leading the team to an undefeated record for the three years of her tenure.         Kraft was the co-founder and director of the U.S.T.A. tennis teachers' conference held annually during the United States Open.         She was inducted into the U.S.T.A./ Middle States Tennis Hall of Fame in 1994 and into the International Tennis Association's Women's Collegiate Hall of Fame in 1996.         A native of Philadelphia, Kraft received a bachelor's degree in political science in 1947 from Antioch College.         She is survived by two sons, Kenneth of Haverford, Pa., and Robert of Los Angeles; four grandchildren; and her companion, G. Reginald Bishop Jr.       
         Ranjabati Sircar, a dancer and choreographer who fused India's classical and folk dance traditions with experimental forms from the West, died in Bombay on Oct. 23. She was 36 and lived in Calcutta.         The cause was unknown, said Jonathan Hollander, a friend and the artistic director of the Battery Dance Company in New York.         Ms. Sircar was the daughter of Manjusri Chaki-Sircar, one of India's best-known dancers. Together they established a school in Calcutta, Dancers' Guild, that focused on what they called navanritya, a contemporary form of Indian dance with its own technique and training system.         Ms. Sircar was born in Nigeria and grew up in the United States. She graduated from Jadavpur University in Calcutta and trained in classical and folk dance in India. She sought, however, a creative synthesis of modern dance from the West with classical Indian traditions.         In 1990 she participated in the International Choreographers Workshop of the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., and in 1992 she founded the South Asian Dance Youth Company, which won her the London Dance and Performance Award. Ms. Sircar wrote ''Navanritya: Toward Contemporary Indian Dance.'' She is survived by her mother, of Calcutta.       
         Phoebe Snetsinger, who saw and recorded more birds than anybody else, died on Nov. 23 in a van accident on a birding expedition to Madagascar, shortly after viewing an exceptionally rare Helmet vanga. She was 68 and lived in Webster Groves, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis.         Birding went from a hobby to a passion for Mrs. Snetsinger on the day in 1981 that a doctor told her she had an incurable cancer, with less than a year to live. Rejecting therapy, she took off to Alaska on a scheduled trip, her first long-distance journey simply to see birds.         ''She came back and felt good,'' her husband, David, said. ''Things just started snowballing from there.''         Mrs. Snetsinger liked to say her avian ardor ''began with a death sentence,'' and her relentless energy reflected that level of urgency as her cancer went into the first of several remissions. Family members and friends could not imagine her without binoculars, floppy hat, sneakers, telescope and other field gear as she scurried around the globe on scores of bird tours, most costing more than $5,000. An inheritance paid the bills; she supplied the boundless energy. She said she spent more time in the world's jungles, mountains and other wild areas than at home.         There were setbacks, as the cancer, melanoma, recurred every five years or so, only to go into remission again. But her record, as verified by the American Birding Association, was sighting about 8,400 birds, or nearly 85 percent of the species now estimated to exist, more than 2,000 birds ahead of her nearest competitor.         ''She was a celebrity in our bunch,'' said Bret Whitney, a co-founder of Field Guides, a tour operator based in Austin, Tex. Mrs. Snetsinger was traveling on one of the group's tours when the van overturned. Mr. Whitney said she apparently died instantly.         ''She gave so much to the birding world and had so much more left to give,'' said G. Stuart Keith, the birding association's first president. At the highest tier of birding, it was a common joke to differentiate between Phoebe Snetsinger and the phoebe, a genus of flycatchers.         Genera, or large groups of species (as in the genus Homo of Homo sapiens), were of considerable importance to Mrs. Snetsinger, who kept a separate list of those that have only a single species, known as monotypic genera. Her list of more than 2,000 such genera far surpassed anyone else's, said Mr. Whitney, who also works as a research associate at Louisiana State University.         She also kept extensive notes on subspecies, using index cards as a catalog until switching in recent months to a computer from the Remington portable typewriter she had used since college.         Her subspecies notes, in whatever format, are important because many of the birds have now been reclassified as species. When she started, there were 8,500 officially named species, compared with about 10,000 now. A spokeswoman for the American Museum of Natural History said some scientists believed there could eventually be as many as 18,000 named separate bird species.         This means that her life list will almost certainly grow posthumously. ''She has birds in escrow,'' Mr. Whitney said.         Mrs. Snetsinger was born in Lake Zurich, Ill., where she attended a one-room elementary school with only two other students. At 11, she met her future husband, then 13, in 4-H clubs.         She graduated from Swarthmore College as a German major, and then taught science at the Baldwin School, a private girls school in Bryn Mawr, Pa. When Mr. Snetsinger returned from service in Korea, they both attended graduate school and she earned a master's degree in German literature.         They had four children, all of whom survive. They are Thomas, of Corvallis, Ore.; Penny, of Woodbridge, Conn.; Carol, of Missoula, Mont., and Susan, of Tempe, Ariz. All but Penny pursued careers relating to birds, Thomas as a researcher in endangered bird species for the Federal government, Carol as a bird researcher in Alaska and Montana, and Susan as a student of the spotted owl in the Northwest.         In 1965, a friend took Mrs. Snetsinger birding for the first time in Minnesota, and when her husband took a corporate job in Missouri she pursued her interest with a group of birders. (Birders adamantly spurn the term ''birdwatcher'' in the belief that it suggests a lack of gravity.) The group visited local woods and prairies each Thursday afternoon.         After birding came to represent a new lease on life to her, Mrs. Snetsinger began to take longer and longer trips. She was hooked when she visited Kenya and saw 500 different birds in three weeks. Her odyssey was aided by new technology for recording bird sounds, greater access to more and more remote habitats and the increasing numbers of tours being offered.         The depth of her enthusiasm is suggested by her response to a fall she took about six months ago while climbing a mountain in the Philippines: she stayed in the field for two additional weeks to see more birds.         The whole idea of listing birds, or at least the seriousness of the pursuit, is also sometimes criticized, or at least satirized. Indeed, it is called ''the game'' by birders themselves. ''It's like collecting stamps or baseball cards,'' said Paul J. Baicich, editor of Birding, the magazine of the American Birding Association.         Mr. Snetsinger said his wife's competitive spirit was kept hidden, though he did not deny it existed. In a 1996 interview, she insisted that she wanted to play down her quantitative quest. ''I'm going back to being a birder, not a lister,'' she said.         Ultimately, she felt very lucky, as she explained in an article to be published in next February's issue of Birding. ''Birding is the best and most exciting pursuit in the world, a glorified never-ending one,'' Mrs. Snetsinger wrote. ''And the whole experience of a foreign trip, whether you see 10 new birds or 500, is simply too good to miss.''       
         Madeline Kahn, the Oscar-nominated comedian best known for her work in the films ''Paper Moon'' and ''Blazing Saddles'' and in the Broadway revival of ''Born Yesterday,'' died yesterday in a Manhattan hospital. She was 57 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was ovarian cancer,  said Jeff Schneider, a spokesman for the William Morris agency, which represented her.         Ms. Kahn acknowledged the illness publicly last month, saying she was undergoing ''aggressive treatment.'' She had been fighting the disease for the last year, Mr. Schneider said.         Once described as a Botticelli angel cracking a malicious grin, Ms. Kahn was one of the nation's queens of comedy on a par with Goldie Hawn, Bette Midler and Lily Tomlin.         Ms. Kahn was nominated for Academy Awards for best supporting actress two years in a row, for her portrayal of a floozy named Trixie Delight in ''Paper Moon'' in 1973 and her role as a saloon singer in ''Blazing Saddles'' in 1974.         She was also nominated for Tony Awards for ''In the Boom Boom Room'' in 1973; ''On the 20th Century'' in 1978, and the revival of ''Born Yesterday'' in 1989.         Ms. Kahn made her debut in the  chorus line of the 1965 City Center revival of ''Kiss Me Kate,'' the show that is now on Broadway. Her Broadway break was in Leonard Stillman's ''New Faces of 1968,'' for which she received glowing reviews.         She won a Tony Award for best actress in 1993 with her role as a ditsy matron in the Broadway production of ''The Sisters Rosensweig.''         Ms. Kahn was also known for her roles in the Mel Brooks movies ''Young Frankenstein'' and ''High Anxiety.'' She had most recently taken on the part of Pauline, a neighbor on the CBS sitcom ''Cosby.''         Discussing comic technique and audience reaction in an interview in 1989 just before she opened on Broadway in the Judy Holliday role in ''Born Yesterday,'' Ms. Kahn remarked: ''Laughter is a strange response. I mean, what is it? It's a spasm of some kind! Is that always joy? It's very often discomfort. It's some sort of explosive reaction.''         Flashing a devilish smile, she added musically, ''It's very complex.''         Critics and fellow actors said her intuitive comic technique derived partly from the daffy, cartoonish way she spoke, savoring some words and flinging out others as if to pop soap bubbles.         One interviewer called her ''a kind of toy person: diminutive, delightful, sexy, impish, cute and capable of squirting vinegar in your eye.''         In ''Blazing Saddles,'' Ms. Kahn used her classically trained voice in an amusing portrayal of a saloon singer who helps Gene Wilder foil Mel Brooks's evil plan to do in the new sheriff in town.         ''She is one of the most talented people that ever lived,'' Mr. Brooks once said. ''I mean, either in stand-up comedy, or acting, or whatever you want, you can't beat Madeline Kahn.''         Madeline Gail Kahn was born in Boston and grew up there and in New York, the child of divorced middle-class parents. She is survived by her husband, John Hansbury, and a brother, Jeffrey.         Ms. Kahn took an early interest in acting. She continued to perform while a student at Hofstra University on Long Island. She was cautioned by a teacher that her baby-talk way of speaking -- which has been described as if ''filtered through a ceramic nose'' -- would be a handicap. But she turned this trait to her advantage. After flirting with a singing career, she made many movies in which she used her voice for comic effect and people remembered it.         In ''Blazing Saddles,'' for example, she played an all-fluff-and-garters loose woman of the Wild West -- a Dietrich sendup -- who makes cowpokes beg for her favors.         When she is bored she tells them to go away, and when one timorous soul presents her with a flower she exclaims memorably: ''Oh, one wed wose! How wovely!''       
         Faith Sale, a publishing executive and the editor of dozens of novels and short-story collections by such authors as Donald Barthelme, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller, Kaye Gibbons and Amy Tan, died on Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 63 and had homes in Greenwich Village and Cold Spring, N.Y.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, the historian and biographer Kirkpatrick Sale.         Known as a devoted writers' advocate and a hands-on editor of a decidedly literary bent, Ms. Sale had a career in publishing that spanned four decades, beginning at J. B. Lippincott and including stints at Macmillan and E. P. Dutton. She spent the last 20 years at G. P. Putnam's Sons, where she was vice president and senior executive editor and is said to have introduced a more literary sensibility.         Her titles there included Mr. Heller's fictional treatment of the life of Rembrandt, ''Picture This'' (1988);  Ms. Tan's breakthrough novel, ''The Joy Luck Club'' (1989); and Mr. Barthelme's collection ''60 Stories'' (1981), which won the PEN/Faulkner fiction award. Most recently she edited Mr. Vonnegut's collection of stories from the 1950's, ''Bagombo Snuff Box,'' which was published in September, and a new novel by Delia Ephron, ''Big City Eyes,'' to be published in March.         Born Faith Apfelbaum in New York in 1936, she grew up in Manhattan and in New Rochelle, N.Y., and attended Cornell University, where she came under the thrall of an authoritative English professor named William M. Sale Jr. She worked on the school newspaper with his son, Kirk, whom she would marry.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Rebekah Sale and Kalista Sale Parish, both of New York; a brother, Ben Apfelbaum of Atlanta; and a granddaughter.       
         Pearl Resnick, the matriarch of a prominent New York real estate family and a philanthropist, died yesterday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.         Mrs. Resnick, whose maiden name was Ezaak, was born on Jan. 3, 1912, in Okna, Ukraine. She came to the United States with her family in 1923.         Nine years later, she married Jack Resnick, who had started a small real estate business in 1928. It grew into one of New York's largest development and construction companies, Jack Resnick & Sons. Mr. Resnick died in 1991.         Mrs. Resnick was a member of the board of overseers of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, in the Bronx.         In addition, she was also a trustee at Yeshiva and a major contributor to both institutions.         Together, the Resnicks established the Jack and Pearl Resnick Gerontology Center and the Jack and Pearl Resnick Fellowship in Geriatrics at Albert Einstein. Mrs. Resnick also endowed an academic chair in brain tumor research in memory of her daughter, Susan Resnick Fisher, who died in 1993.         In recognition of Mr. and Mrs. Resnick's support, the campus of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine was named in their honor in 1990.         Gershon Kekst, president of Kekst & Company, a New York public relations firm, said that Mrs. Resnick's character and charm were as important as her ability to raise money. Mr. Kekst, who is chairman of the Jewish Theological Seminary, recalled that about eight years ago, when the seminary was in financial straits, Mrs. Resnick joined the board and put everyone at ease. Mr. Kekst said that after a board meeting, Mrs. Resnick told him: ''That was a very good meeting. Things are going to be all right.''         Mrs. Resnick was a board member of Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. She and her husband also helped finance the Jack and Pearl Resnick Film Division of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.         She is survived by two sons, Burton P. Resnick of Rye, N.Y., and Ira Resnick of Manhattan; a daughter, Marilyn Katz of Purchase, N.Y.; a sister, Anna Sherman of Yonkers; 10 grandchildren; and 5 great-grandchildren.       
         Janet Bode, the author of 14 nonfiction books with socially conscious themes for young adults, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich Village in Manhattan. She was 56.         The cause was breast cancer, said her companion of many years, Stan Mack, the cartoonist.         Ms. Bode's books were about interracial dating, teenage immigrants, rape, sibling rivalry, teenage parents, troubled love, friendship, eating disorders and other concerns of young people. Her literary technique, she explained to an interviewer in 1997, was to pick a topic resonant with meaning for teenagers, interview hundreds of young adults across the country and then present their comments verbatim.         Among her books were ''Death Is Hard to Live With,'' ''Voices of Rape'' and ''The Colors of Freedom'' (1999), a book addressed to teenage immigrants. Her books are not the kind usually reviewed by critics, but their value to troubled or perplexed young adults has been recognized by organizations like the American Library Association, which designated six of her titles Best Books for Young Adults.         Ms. Bode was born on July 14, 1943, in Penn Yan, N.Y., the daughter of the late Carl Bode, a professor of English and American Studies at the University of Maryland, and the former Charlotte Watkins Smith. She attended schools in London in the late 1950's when her father was cultural attache at the American Embassy there. She graduated from the University of Maryland in 1965.         In addition to Mr. Mack, Ms. Bode is survived by two sisters, Barbara, of Washington, and Carolyn, of Santa Monica, Calif.       
         Lucile Petry Leone, the founding director of the United States Cadet Nurse Corps, which recruited more than 100,000 young women to study nursing and helped spare the country of the need to draft nurses in World War II, died on Nov. 25 at an assisted-living center in San Francisco. She was 97.         As early as the summer of 1941, months before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, there was talk in Washington that it might be necessary to conscript nurses to care for the inevitable high number of casualties there would be should the United States become engaged in a major war.         A less radical alternative -- and a much more politically acceptable one -- was temporarily agreed upon. The United States Public Health Service would start a program to attract young women at schools throughout the country into nursing. Lucile Petry, a teacher at the University of Minnesota School of Nursing, was chosen to initiate the program.         Two years later, after the United States was at war in both Europe and Asia, Ms. Leone founded and directed the Cadet Nurse Corps, a more formal effort to start women on a path to nursing. The program, authorized by Congress in 1943, offered to cover the cost of a candidate's tuition, fees, room and board, books, monthly stipends and snappy navy-style uniforms.         In exchange, said Ellen Schell, a nursing historian based in San Francisco, candidates had to ''promise to participate in essential military or civilian nursing for as long as the war lasted.''         The Cadet Nurse Corps proved a success, meeting its recruitment quotas in 1943 and 1944 and outstripping them in the final year of the war, when there were 112,000 cadets in the program. As a consequence, the United States never had to draft nurses into the armed services during the war.         Explaining the success of the Cadet Nurse Corps, Ms. Leone told an interviewer in 1945: ''We had a saleable package from the beginning. The girls immediately liked the idea of being able to combine war service with professional education for the future.''         She also gave credit to the organization's slogan, ''Custodians of the Crises of Life.''         In 1949, Ms. Leone became the first woman to direct a division of the United States Public Health Service, the Division of Nurse Education. Her rank was equivalent to that of an admiral.         ''In that capacity,'' said Zina Mirsky, assistant dean for administration at the School of Nursing of the University of California at San Francisco, ''she established the role of nursing in the federal government -- a presence that still exists.''         Ms. Leone retired from government service in 1966 and went on to teach nursing and serve as associate dean at Texas Women's University.  She retired again in 1971.         Lucile Petry, the only child of a high school principal and his wife, was born on Jan. 23, 1902, in Frog Heaven, in Preble County, Ohio. She was reared in Selbyville, Del., and  after graduating from the University of Delaware in 1924, she received  advanced degrees at the Johns Hopkins University School of Nursing in 1927 and Columbia Teachers College in 1929. She taught at the Yale School of Nursing and the University of Minnesota School of Nursing before being summoned to Washington.         Ms. Leone's marriage to Nicholas Leone ended in divorce in 1967. She has no immediate survivors.       
         Nilde Iotti, an early leader of the Italian Communist Party and the first woman to become president of the lower house of Parliament, died Friday night of heart failure after a long illness, the news agency ANSA reported. She was 79.         Ms. Iotti, who served as a Partisan during World War II, was first elected to office in 1946, winning a seat in the constitutional assembly. At age 26, she took part in the ''Committee of the 75,'' which wrote a first draft of Italy's postwar constitution.         From 1979 until 1992, she served as Italy's president of the lower house of Parliament, a role similar to that of the speaker of the house in the United States. It made her No. 2 in line to succeed the president.         In Parliament, her regal manner earned her the nicknames, ''Czarina'' and ''The Red Queen.'' She described herself differently, saying, ''I'm just a woman who has a difficult job and tries to do it with tact.''         The daughter of a railway worker, Ms. Iotti was born in Reggio Emilia, the heart of Italy's ''red belt'' and studied literature at the Catholic University of Milan. She moved to Rome after the war, where she met and fell in love with Palmiro Togliatti, Italy's Communist Party leader.         Mr. Togliatti was married, and divorce was then illegal in Italy. The couple adopted a daughter in 1950, the sister of a worker killed by police during a strike in Modena. The couple stayed together until Mr. Togliatti's death in 1964.         Viewed throughout her life as a staunch member of the Communist Party's central committee, Ms. Iotti changed along with many in her party after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. She was one of the first party officials to endorse the proposal to rid the party of its hammer and sickle and rename themselves ''Democrats of the Left.''         Ms. Iotti, who campaigned to legalize divorce and abortion in Italy, resigned from Parliament last month, citing ill health.         Her coffin will be laid in state in the Italian Parliament and she will receive a state funeral on Monday. She is survived by her daughter, Marisa Malagoli Togliatti.       
         Rose E. Bird, who became the first woman on California's Supreme Court and whose resolute opposition to the death penalty later led voters to remove her as chief justice, died of complications from breast cancer on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 63.         Almost from the moment she was appointed to head the state's highest court by Gov. Jerry Brown in 1977, Ms. Bird, a pioneering liberal lawyer who had never been a judge, became one of the most controversial figures in California politics. She led a liberal majority that strengthened environmental laws and consumer rights. But in 1986, voters angry at her opposition to the death penalty removed her and two other Brown-appointed justices by refusing to extend their terms. They were the first such removals in California history.         Ms. Bird, who came of professional age at a time when major law firms still resisted hiring women, held a succession of path-breaking jobs. She was the first woman hired by the Santa Clara County public defender's office in Northern California, and she became the first woman to hold a cabinet-level post in state government when Mr. Brown named her his secretary of agriculture in 1975. Many of her detractors were forced to acknowledge her administrative skills, while even her admirers among judges and lawyers conceded the brittleness that made her a lighting rod for criticism.         Judge Stephen Reinhardt of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, who had known her for years, said Ms. Bird had ''a total passion for, and commitment to, justice.''         ''In some ways, she was just too good to be a judge, he said. ''She had a total passion and commitment, and that's not always the best way to function and get along in this world, in a political environment. From the day she got to the Supreme Court, she never really had a chance.''         After the death penalty was reinstated in California in the late 1970's, Judge Bird never upheld a death sentence, voting to vacate such sentences 61 times. She survived repeated efforts to recall her, but was ousted after Governor George Deukmejian, a Republican, led an aggressive campaign against her.         To this day, Ms. Bird's name remains a kind of reflexive shorthand in California for ''soft-on-crime liberal.'' In last year's election, the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor, State Attorney General Dan Lungren, sought to tar his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Gray Davis, by association, because Mr. Davis had been Governor Brown's chief of staff at the time of Ms. Bird's appointment.         ''I appreciate that some people within our state are impatient, impatient to see executions,'' Ms. Bird said after her removal. ''I don't think anybody in this state will sit easy if, in fact, this becomes a court that ensures nothing but executions to appease the overweening and insatiable attitude of ambitious politicians.''         Today, in part because of long-running arguments over capital punishment, California has the largest death row in the nation, with more than 500 inmates sentenced to die. But virtually the entire state political establishment, Democratic as well as Republican, now favors the death penalty, and the pace of executions is widely expected to increase.         Rose Elizabeth Bird was born on Nov. 2, 1936, in Tucson, the youngest of three children whose parents ran a chicken farm. Her parents separated in 1941, and her father died soon after. Ms. Bird's widowed mother, Anne, moved the family to New York, her home state.         Young Rose was a standout scholar in high school, earning a scholarship to Long Island University, where she majored in English in preparation for a career in journalism. She later enrolled as a graduate student in political science at the University of California at Berkeley, but an internship in the State Legislature in Sacramento persuaded her to switch to law school, because lawyers seemed to have the most influence on public policy.         After working as a public defender and teaching a seminar in criminal defense at Stanford University's law school, Ms. Bird became a volunteer in Mr. Brown's 1974 campaign for governor, serving as his frequent chauffeur on his trips to her area and later as a trusted adviser on his transition team. On taking office, Mr. Brown broke precedent by naming Ms. Bird secretary of agriculture, a post traditionally held by a grower. Ms. Bird emphasized consumer protection and worker health and safety, moving to ban the use of a short-handled hoe that forced farm laborers to spend hours stooped in the fields. She also drafted a landmark farm labor bill guaranteeing workers' rights to hold secret-ballot union elections and shepherded it through the legislature.         The controversy she generated in the agriculture post was nothing compared to the criticism that greeted her nomination as chief justice in 1977. Police groups and politicians around the state opposed her on the grounds that she would favor defendants, and Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles, then a bishop and head of the state Agricultural Relations Board, questioned her ''emotional stability'' and her ''vindictive approach to dealing with all persons under her authority.''         Just a year later, conservatives outraged by her decisions on school busing, taxes and other issues began a campaign to remove her. Under California law, supreme court justices appointed by the governor must be approved by the electorate in the next gubernatorial election, and periodically thereafter.         She survived the opposition that year. But on the morning of election day, The Los Angeles Times published an article, citing anonymous sources, suggesting that the Supreme Court had deliberately delayed issuing a split decision overturning a law mandating prison sentences for those convicted of using a gun in certain crimes, so as not to hurt Judge Bird's chances at the polls.         That led to public hearings by the state Commission on Judicial Performance, which portrayed the court as riven by personal conflicts and political infighting. No formal charges of misconduct were brought against any justice, but the controversy generated by the investigation lingered on.         After her ouster in 1986, Ms. Bird, who never married, retreated into semi-seclusion. She cared for her aged mother in Palo Alto and surfaced occasionally as a television commentator or a public speaker, but dropped even some old friends and associates. She had battled breast cancer intermittently since 1976. Her mother died in 1991, and she is survived by two brothers, Philip, of Hawaii, and Jack, of Arizona.         ''If you have never experienced life under a microscope, you need to understand that those who live a public life are no longer seen as real persons -- human beings,'' Ms. Bird wrote in a 1996 newspaper column. ''Rather, they are objects to be examined, manipulated, ridiculed and sometimes even hated.''       
         Margaret A. Greenfield, a founder and officer of the Independent Journalism Foundation and a dealer in art, antiques and real estate, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 74.         She had cancer, said her husband, James L. Greenfield.         Beginning in the 1950's, Mrs. Greenfield was an art and antiques dealer in London, Washington and finally Manhattan, where for about the last 25 years she owned and ran an antiques shop, Marco Polo, on Madison Avenue between 84th and 85th Streets. It closed about a year ago.         She also renovated and resold brownstones on the Upper East Side.         Mrs. Greenfield was active in the Independent Journalism Foundation from its inception in 1991. The foundation, based in Manhattan, teaches citizens of former Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe about working as journalists in newly democratic societies.         She was the foundation's treasurer and one of its founders, along with her husband and Donald M. Wilson, a former vice president of Time Inc. Mr. Greenfield, a former foreign correspondent for Time magazine and former assistant secretary of state, is now a consulting member of the editorial board at The New York Times, where he has also been foreign editor and later an assistant managing editor.         Mrs. Greenfield created and furnished the foundation's four centers in Eastern European capitals -- in Prague, Bratislava, Bucharest and Budapest.         Margaret Ann Schwertley Greenfield was born in Gooding, Idaho. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Idaho and worked as a stewardess for United Airlines and then for Pan American World Airways.         She met Mr. Greenfield when she was based in Hong Kong in the early 1950's, while she was Pan Am's first stewardess based in the Far East. They were married in 1954.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Anne Schwertley of Manhattan and Jane Schwertley of Gainesville, Fla.       
         Elizabeth Zimmermann, who brought a penetrating intellect and a sculptor's sensitivity to revolutionizing the ancient art of knitting, died Nov. 30 at a hospital in Marshfield, Wis., where she lived. She was 89.         Mrs. Zimmermann's best-known gift to knitting was a mathematical formula for figuring the proportions of sweaters and other garments, depending on how many stitches per inch the knitter wanted to use. But her passion, expressed in magazine columns, in four books and at her knitting camp, the nation's first, was creating beauty. She gently urged knitters to challenge the limits of their imaginations.         ''She allowed people to be intuitive about their knitting, rather than just being blind followers of the written word,'' said Nancy J. Thomas, editor of Knitter's Magazine. ''She had a way of being breezy and fun. She made everything seem easy.''         Linda Ligon, president of Interweave Press, which specializes in traditional textile crafts, said Mrs. Zimmermann ''brought intelligence and validity to a craft that had been trivialized as women's work.''         Elizabeth Lloyd-Jones was born near Devon, England, in 1910, the daughter of a naval officer and the woman who invented Meals by Motor, a British forerunner of Meals on Wheels. Her youthful memories, as recalled in ''Knitting Around'' (Schoolhouse Press, 1989), suggested a bucolic paradise, framed by plum trees and plum jam, governesses and private schools.         ''I had a wonderful hideyhole in a gone-to-seed cabbage patch,'' Mrs. Zimmermann said, ''and one day had the excitement and glory of falling through the roof of an abandoned chicken house, garnering the first permanent scar on my leg.''         The women of her mother's family knitted. One day, she asked her mother if she could try knitting, perhaps the most important words she ever uttered.         ''If you're good all day today, I'll teach you tomorrow,'' her mother answered.         Miss Lloyd-Jones attended art schools in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Munich, where she sold sweaters of her own design to a local shop for pocket money. She also met Arnold Zimmermann, a brewer. He had to flee Hitler's Germany because an SS agent overheard him making a snide remark about Hitler. They married in England, immigrated to New York and moved several times before settling in Wisconsin.         Mrs. Zimmermann began spending morning after morning with local knitters, exchanging tips. She became frustrated with many of her friends' lockstep reliance on precise instructions in printed patterns. So, in 1955, she submitted her designs for Norwegian-pattern sweaters to Woman's Day magazine, resolving to use clear language. Other magazines also accepted her designs, and in 1959, she started her own knitting publication.         About the same time, the family, with three children, moved into a derelict schoolhouse in the middle of the woods and remodeled it. She combined her newsletter with a mail-order business for knitting supplies, books and video productions under the name Schoolhouse Press.         She was hostess of a knitting program shown on many public television stations and in 1974 began a knitting camp under the auspices of the University of Wisconsin. The camp has continued every summer since. She also led workshops throughout the United States and in New Zealand.         Besides ''Knitting Around,'' her books included ''Knitting Without Tears'' (Scribner's/Macmillan, 1971), Knitter's Almanac (Scribner's/Dover, 1975) and ''Knitting Workshop'' (Schoolhouse Press, 1981).         She was a woman who held to strong principles about her work, like never using any thread but wool. But she never criticized another knitter's use of other materials, including the dreaded polyester. She developed a reputation for giving pithy advice.         ''A knitter's question which arises perennially,'' she wrote in Knitter's Almanac, ''is, 'How much wool should I buy?' ''         She said there was no blanket answer, but advised, ''If you are using very thick wool, buy more than you could possibly imagine; if you are using very thin wool, use surprisingly little.''         But Mrs. Zimmermann's larger influence was in design, making sweaters and other garments in round tubes, rather than in flat pieces to be joined together. The result was a sculptural quality, said her daughter Meg Swansen, who is also a noted knitter and will carry on her mother's business. By contrast, Kaffe Fassett, a knitter whose work is often exhibited in art galleries, is known for his painterly approach, she said.         But Ms. Ligon said sculptural effects were just the beginning. She said Mrs. Zimmermann's mathematical formula for constructing sweaters in the round freed knitters to concentrate on other creative concerns, like yarn and stitches.         ''She was more than a sculptor,'' Ms. Ligon said. ''She was an engineer.''         Many knitters said the system opened up new possibilities to them.  ''She made me a thinking knitter,'' said Joyce Williams of Sparta, Wis., who attended three knitting camps with Mrs. Zimmermann.         A woman from Reading, Mass., in an online customer review of ''Knitting Without Tears'' on Amazon.com, said: ''Elizabeth's wonderful instructions, comments and faith gave me the O.K. to go ahead and have fun. I made a patterned yoke sweater that not only looks great, but fits as well.''         In addition to Ms. Swansen, who lives in Pittsville, Wis., Mrs. Zimmermann is survived by her husband, Arnold; another daughter, Lloie, of Pittsville; a son, Thomas, of New Hope, Pa.; two grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.         Mrs. Zimmermann chose to play down her influence on knitting, coining the term ''unventions'' for her woolly inventions.         ''The products of science and technology may be new, and some of them are quite horrid, but knitting?'' she wrote in Knitter's Almanac. ''In knitting there are ancient possibilities; the earth is enriched with the dust of millions of knitters who have held wool and needles since the beginning of sheep.''       
         Jeanne S. Chall, a leading expert on how children learn to read and a vociferous antagonist in at least two of the major educational controversies of the last quarter-century, died on Nov. 27 at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 78.         The cause was heart failure, said Ariadne Valsamis, a spokeswoman for the Harvard Graduate School of Education, where Dr. Chall taught for 26 years, until retiring in 1991.         Dr. Chall championed both challenging reading material for children and the use of phonics in basic reading instruction, as against limited-vocabulary texts and the so-called whole-language approach.         With the argument that easy is not necessarily good, she was a rigorous opponent of the prevailing view of reading specialists in the mid-1970's that if assigned reading was too difficult, children would become frustrated and give up trying to master it.         That view, Dr. Chall said, was responsible for a rash of ''cute kiddie books'' with lavish four-color illustrations, limited vocabulary and rudimentary syntax that made few demands on early readers.         Dr. Chall (pronounced shawl) attacked that orthodoxy with scores of books and articles in which she called for challenging primers.         Dr. Chall pressed her beliefs in a 1977 study that was commissioned by the College Board as part of a project to learn the reasons for a sharp decline since 1962 in average scores on the reading-comprehension part of the SAT. Although her report pointed to a number of possible explanations, it found that the scores tended to rise with the level of difficulty of the material students had been given to read from their earliest days in school.         Dr. Chall engaged in renewed combat in 1983, when, in the spring issue of Contemporary Education Review, she wrote a blistering review of a scholarly book, ''On Learning to Read'' (Knopf, 1982), by the psychologists  Bruno Bettelheim and Karen Zelan.         The Bettelheim-Zelan book, which had been almost universally praised by other professional educators, argued that the ability to decode words need not be taught but instead was intuitive, resulting without effort from the reading of imaginative, interesting stories. Accordingly, the authors said, the cure for the decline in reading scores was more entertaining and engaging primers.         Dr. Chall scorned that argument, maintaining that ''comparisons of different beginning-reading methods over the past 70 years have found that methods that teach decoding earlier and more systematically produce better word recognition as well as better reading comprehension.''         Dr. Chall also vigorously supported phonics, the method of teaching beginners to read by having them associate certain letters with the sounds those letters represent.         Many experts have de-emphasized phonics over the last two decades and instead adopted the whole-language approach, in which reading is taught through context rather than recognition of the alphabet. But Dr. Chall said her research showed that knowledge of the alphabet and familiarity with the sounds that make up words were crucial.         She expressed her view in ''Learning to Read: The Great Debate'' (Harcourt Brace, 1967), recognized as a definitive analysis of reading research.         Jeanne Stemlicht Chall was born in Poland on Jan. 1, 1921, and moved with her family to New York City when she was 7. She became the first member of her family to go to college, graduating cum laude from City College in 1941. She earned both a master's degree (1947) and a Ph.D. (1952) from Ohio State University, and taught at Ohio State, Teachers College of Columbia University and City College before joining the Harvard faculty.         Dr. Chall is survived by three sisters, Sylvia Rauch of East Brunswick, N.J., and Miriam Warmbrand and Shirley Decker, both of Rego Park, Queens, and seven nieces and nephews.
