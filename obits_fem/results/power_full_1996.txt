         Esther S. Manz, who was a 208-pound housewife pregnant with her fifth child when a kitchen-table gathering in 1948 inspired her to found TOPS, a weight-loss support group that grew into a 300,000-member nonprofit organization, died on Monday at the Heritage Nursing Home in Milwaukee. Mrs. Manz, who made her home in Greenfield, Wis., a suburb of Milwaukee, was 88.         TOPS, which stands for Take Off Pounds Sensibly, draws its philosophy from something the 5-foot-2-inch Mrs. Manz, then 40, observed in group sessions intended to prepare women for childbirth: the power of mutual support in helping participants remain within their doctors' guidelines for weight.         TOPS members work out a sensible diet and weight goal with their physician and provide evidence of having consulted a doctor before attending weekly meetings that include a weigh-in and provide support and encouragement for members.         Men and women who achieve their weight goals become KOPS (Keep Off Pounds Sensibly), role models who are themselves reinforced in their efforts to maintain their weight by continuing to attend meetings.         "Life is a battle," Mrs. Manz once said. "Just let us win the one on obesity."         According to data from the weekly weigh-ins, TOPS members in 12,000 chapters  in the United States and abroad lost more than 740 tons last year, a spokeswoman said yesterday.         The nonprofit organization, based in Milwaukee, is supported by membership dues -- $16 in each of the first two years and $14 thereafter. When Mrs. Manz wrote TOPS's articles of incorporation in 1952, she committed it to finding a cure for obesity, and TOPS says it has contributed more than $4.5 million to obesity research.         After Mrs. Manz and three friends established their support group at her kitchen table in Milwaukee, the organization's name took its final form as the result of a newspaper article.         Mrs. Manz said she originally thought of it as TOP. "We didn't even have a name for our club at first, but when we went down to The Milwaukee Journal to be interviewed about our organization, the reporter asked what we called ourselves," she said in the group's handbook for new members. When the article was published, the name appeared as TOPS, and Mrs. Manz said it was later suggested that the S be made to stand for "sensibly."         On Jan. 21, 1948, the first meeting of TOPS was held at a Milwaukee community center. In the early days of the organization, Mrs. Manz carried a scale with her as she made her rounds as roving ambassador, organizing meetings.         Mrs. Manz, who achieved average proportions in her effort to control her weight, became president and chairwoman of the TOPS board in 1952. Declining health prompted her to relinquish the presidency in 1991, but she remained chairwoman until her death.         Born in 1907 in Plymouth, Wis., she grew up as Esther Schuland and graduated  in 1926 from Wisconsin State Teachers College. She taught at rural Wisconsin schools, married Gilbert Manz, a steelworker, in 1929 and later moved to Milwaukee, where she became a housewife.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Manz is survived by a son, Gilbert Jr.; four daughters, Bonnie Prieben, Maureen Weigert, Barbara Canapa and Marjory von Hof;  a brother, Carl Schuland, of Green Bay, Wis., 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. All of Mrs. Manz's children live in Milwaukee except for Mrs. von Hof, a resident of Altura, Minn.       
         Barbara McLean, an Oscar-winning Hollywood film editor whose influence at 20th Century-Fox extended far beyond the cutting room, died on March 28 at a convalescent home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 92 and had lived in Newport Beach since her retirement in 1969 after 20 years as head of the studio's editing division.         One of the first women to work as a film editor in Hollywood, Miss McLean, who began as an assistant in the 1920's and cut her first movie, "Gallant Lady," in 1933, knew her place:         For decades it was in the chair next to Darryl F. Zanuck, the Fox studio chief, who relied so much on the judgment of the woman he called Bobby that he rarely made a major decision on anything from costumes to casting without consulting her first.         And when he did, arguments tended to cease. Studio executives knew that when  Mr. Zanuck prefaced a statement with "Bobby says . . . ," he wasn't expressing an opinion but announcing a decision.         There was the time in 1936, for example, when Mr. Zanuck and other executives were watching screen tests, trying to decide between two actors for a leading role. When the projection room lights went up, Mr. Zanuck turned to Miss McLean  as usual, and as usual she didn't disappoint: Don Ameche was good, she said, but the other fellow looked more dashing in the movie's costumes.         "Bobby says . . . ," said Mr. Zanuck, and Tyrone Power got the part in "LLoyd's of London" that made him a star.         Miss McLean, whose scores of credits included "All About Eve," "12 O'Clock High," "The Robe" and "Tobacco Road," won an Academy Award in 1944 for her work  on the documentary "Wilson," a biography of Woodrow Wilson.         But for all her undisputed skills, Miss McLean had to break through entrenched sexual stereotypes to get a job in the first place.         Although other women worked as editors in the 1930's, including Dorothy Spencers, Marjorie Fowler, Margaret Booth and Ada Warren, editing was considered man's work.         In the division of Hollywood labor, women might work as actresses, seamstresses, secretaries or even film lab technicians, where their nimble fingers were even deemed to give them an advantage in the delicate task of cutting and splicing film to a male editor's specifications.         Miss McLean's fingers were as nimble as anyone's, and no wonder. She had been cutting and splicing since she was a teen-ager working in the film lab that her  father, Charles Pollut, operated near the family's home in Palisades Park, N.J.         After she married Gordon McLean, a projectionist, the couple went to Hollywood in 1924. Miss McLean found work as a film technician, then worked as an assistant editor for a number of studios, and in the early 1930's began the long association with Mr. Zanuck, who inevitably selected her to edit his personal productions at Fox.         Miss McLean, whose early marriage ended in divorce, married the director Robert Webb in 1951 after working with him on the movie "David and Bathsheba." Mr. Webb died several years ago.         She is survived by a stepson, James Webb, of Payson, Ariz.

         Olga Marie Madar, who rose to the top echelon in the United Automobile Workers and fought for women's rights in the labor movement, died on Thursday at her home in Detroit. She was 80.         The cause was heart failure, the union said.         Ms. Madar achieved several firsts for women in a union career that spanned 62 years. With pressure from restive female members and the support of Walter P. Reuther, the union's president, she was in 1966 the first woman to take a seat on the union's board.         She was also the first woman to be elected an international vice president of the union, in 1970. And she was the founding national president of the Coalition of Labor Union Women in 1974. She retired as an officer of the union in 1974 but remained active in retiree affairs until last year.         She was born in Sykesville, Pa., one of 12 children of a coal miner and grocer who moved the family to Detroit in search of work when she was 15. In 1933, she found a summer job on a Chrysler assembly line.         Years later she recalled that the line moved so fast she could "never keep up" and had nightmares about it. She said she was apparently kept on the job because of her citywide reputation as a terror on the women's softball team.         "There was no union at the plant then," she said, "and the fact that they would hire me when other workers were being laid off -- just because I could play softball -- was incredible. It was my first indication that a union was badly needed."         She remained an advocate for women, aware that women rarely worked more than  two or three days a week and were the last hired and first fired. Working summers, she graduated from Eastern Michigan University in Ypsilanti in 1938 with a degree in physical education.         She reached her first milestone as a unionist in 1947 when she became the director of the recreation department at the auto workers union. She was elected to the policy-setting board at the union convention in 1966.         She joined Reuther in squashing a notion that labor should chart its own political course rather than stick to its alliance with the Democrats. .         Unhappiness among female union members with their lack of power within the unions led to the formation in 1974 of the Coalition of Labor Union Women.         Ms. Madar was also active in civic affairs, working with national organizations with programs to improve parks and recreation centers in the inner cities. She also acted to give citizens access to decision-making in that area.         The union said it had no immediate word on survivors.       
         Maria Telkes, an advocate of putting the sun's energy to use and one of the first researchers to do so in an experimental residence, died last Dec. 2 in Budapest on her first visit to her native Hungary in 70 years. She was 95 and lived in North Miami, Fla.         News of her death was relayed by members of the Hungarian community in this country last week.         Dr. Telkes also developed a solar salt-water still for the Navy in World War II, which saved the lives of torpedoed sailors and downed airmen. She spent many years experimenting with stoves that used solar energy for their heat and were simple and cheap enough for use by  villagers in poor, arid regions.         She also worked on an air-conditioning system in the 1970's that stored ''coolness'' at night for use the next day. The idea was to reduce power demand during hot spells and lower the risk of electrical ''brownouts'' and blackouts.         Born in Budapest, Dr. Telkes received a doctorate in physical chemistry at the University of Budapest, where she started her career as an instructor. She came to the United States in 1925 to visit a cousin, who was then the Hungarian consul in Cleveland, and stayed when the Cleveland Clinic Foundation hired her as a biophysicist.         She worked there for 12 years under Dr. George Crile. In a series of experiments they invented a photoelectric mechanism capable of recording brain waves.         Later, she carried out research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University and the University of Pennsylvania, among others. She retired in 1977 as a senior scientist at the University of Delaware but remained active as a consultant until about three years ago.         In the 1940's she teamed up with an architect, Eleanor Raymond, to build the first solar-heated house, using a chemical that crystalized and retained the heat and then radiated it back to keep a constant temperature. The plant used no auxiliary power source but still kept the five-room house in Dover, Mass., cozy through the winter.       
         Annabella, a film star with flashing eyes who became the toast of France in the 1930's, died on Wednesday at her home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris. She was 86.         The cause was a heart attack, said a friend, Jose Sourillan, according to The Associated Press.         Annabella, whose real name was Suzanne Georgette Charpentier, was the daughter of a French publisher. She rose to celebrity when she starred in two films directed by Rene Clair: ''Le Million'' (1931), about hunting for a lost lottery ticket, and ''Quatorze Juillet,'' or ''July 14th'' (1933), about the adventures of a flower girl and a cab driver. They are still widely regarded as her finest work.         Her skill at playing the gamine became known in the United States, where The New York American commented in 1937: ''Among screen types she is like a fresh breeze among too many orchidaceous blooms. Her eyes are frank, her forehead high and her mouth childishly quizzical.''         She moved on to Hollywood and starred in a down-to-earth role opposite Tyrone Power when he played the canal builder in ''Suez'' (1938). Later that year, when her plans to divorce the French actor Jean Murat drew wide attention, she was quoted in The New York Mirror as saying: ''It is not always good to be a film star in America. It is like being a goldfish in a bowl. They must know what I eat, what I think, they even want to know whom I love -- and that I tell no one.''         In 1939 she married Power. She appeared in four other American films and in 1942 became an American citizen. But Annabella achieved only minor success in her adopted country. She returned to France for good after a divorce in 1948 from Power, who went on to marry the actress Linda Christian.         Back in Europe, Annabella failed to regain her earlier acclaim. Her last film was ''Le Plus Bel Amour de Don Juan'' (1952).         In her teens she started out as a dancer. She made her first screen appearance, at 16, under the name Annabella, in a minor role in the epic-length silent film ''Napoleon'' (1926), with Abel Gance as director and screenwriter. Other minor film parts followed, until she was chosen by Clair, regarded by the film world as an original stylist, for her roles in ''Le Million'' and ''Quatorze Juillet.''         In 1936 she moved on to Britain, where she starred in three movies made there in 1937: ''Wings of the Morning,'' which was in color, ''Under the Red Robe'' and ''Dinner at the Ritz.''         Then Hollywood beckoned, and she appeared in ''The Baroness and the Butler'' (1938) before taking the role in ''Suez.'' That year she also found time to star in ''Hotel du Nord,'' directed by Marcel Carne, a classic with a fond view of working-class Parisians.         In 1940 Annabella and Power performed together in the Screen Guild radio production of ''Seventh Heaven,'' and the next year they were onstage together in a summer stock revival of Ferenc Molnar's hit ''Liliom.''         Over the years she took other roles in theatrical productions in New York, London and elsewhere.  The New York Times theater critic Brooks Atkinson praised her acting in a 1946 production of Jean-Paul Sartre's play ''No Exit'' as ''a bold and calculated performance that packs one corner of hell with horror.''         She is survived by a daughter, Anne Werner Power of Boston.       
         Guillermina Rico, a lemon peddler who bargained her way to wealth and power as the head of a political machine she forged from the ranks of Mexico City's itinerant vendors, died on Wednesday of a cerebral hemorrhage. She was 63.         In the market stalls and side streets she was known as La Jefa, the boss, and at her death her office walls were adorned with photos of the curly-haired matriarch, often wearing a trademark white apron, with senators, mayors, police chiefs and every Mexican president since Jose Lopez Portillo took office in 1976.         Today 2,000 people marched three miles from the city center to a weed-choked cemetery in a working class suburb, bearing Mrs. Rico's coffin to a plot wafting with the scent of lily and lavender and heaped with scores of wreaths. The trumpets of a mariachi sounded a dirge.         ''I feel like an orphan,'' said Pablo Ibarra, a 45-year-old vendor who accompanied her coffin. ''She helped me, and many others, to earn an honest living on the streets.''         In a 40-year career, Mrs. Rico led thousands of market peddlers through cycles of street war and peace with successive Mexico City mayors, who have repeatedly sought to clear the streets of the informal merchants who block sidewalks in front of tax-paying businesses. Sometimes the vendors have been removed to suburban markets, but always they have returned.         The vendors, whose ranks swelled during years of economic crisis as farmers lost their land and factory workers were dismissed, hawk everything from tortillas to tires to pirated American music tapes. Today Mexico City's central market is among the largest outlets in the world for contraband.         Mrs. Rico was born in 1934 in the downtown neighborhood of La Merced into a clan of street sellers. Both parents migrated to Mexico City during the Depression from outlying states. Guillermina's three brothers, Manuel, Fernando and Candido, also devoted their lives to street commerce, Roberto Hidalgo Lopez, one of Mrs. Rico's advisers said in a cemetery speech today.         Both of Mrs. Rico's parents died when she was a teen-ager, and Mrs. Rico was forced to give up school after fourth grade, Mr. Hidalgo said.         She began working the street at age 15, peddling lemons and avocados, and three years later, married another vendor: Salvador Sanchez Velazquez. They had four children.         In 1946, Mrs. Rico joined the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party, known as the PRI, and eventually she organized the vendors into a powerful bloc that cast thousands of ballots for the governing party.         During the early years, Mrs. Rico's leadership was informal, but in 1965 she organized 500 merchants into the Civic Union of Street Vendors of Old Merced. Twenty years later, the union's ranks had swelled to 3,000, and by 1985 it stood at 7,000.         Mrs. Rico gained the power to assign the choicest market stalls, for which she charged a quota, and those and other revenues made her wealthy. The Chamber of Commerce estimate in 1988 that Mrs. Rico and other union leaders collected about $1 million annually.         She funneled vast sums into the pockets of city authorities, partly to forestall their periodic threats to remove the vendors. Some of her riches she channeled into social work, and she once responded to a reporter's question about what she had done for Mexico: ''Ask the priests in the downtown churches who is the one that helps them. Go to the shelters. Ask the drug addicts and the alcoholics undergoing rehabilitation.''         She is survived by her brother Candido, her four children, Silvia, Margarita, Isabel, and Salvador, all of whom live in Mexico City, and 16 grandchildren, Mr. Hidalgo said.       
         Ljuba Welitsch, the flame-haired Bulgarian-born soprano whose career was highlighted by her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in ''Salome'' in 1949, died on Monday in a hospital in Vienna. Miss Welitsch, who had become an Austrian citizen, was 83.         The cause of death was a series of strokes, said Herta Wiedenhuber, the executor of her estate.         Miss Welitsch's performance in the title role of the Richard Strauss opera on Feb. 4, 1949, was regarded as one of the most memorable in Metropolitan Opera history. The packed house had turned out mainly to hear Fritz Reiner make his Met debut as a conductor, but by the time the performance ended, with at least 15 minutes of cheering and whistling from an ecstatic audience, Miss Welitsch had become an international star.         ''Miss Welitsch is a musician and interpreter of flaming temperament, who has the part absolutely in her hand,'' Olin Downes wrote in his review in The New York Times the next day. ''She is an actress of individuality and power.''         A few days later, Miss Welitsch dazzled the critics again, displaying her versatility in the title role of Verdi's ''Aida'' and prompting Howard Taubman of The Times to call her ''one of the few perfect singers to come to the Met in recent years.''         But Miss Welitsch's extensive repertory and her determination to make up for the years on the international stage that she had lost during World War II shortened her operatic career. She drove her voice mercilessly, and by the mid-1950's, critics seemed to agree that her best singing was behind her.         At the Met, she appeared in 63 performances between her debut and her final appearance, in the nonsinging role of the Duchesss of Krakenthorp in Donizetti's ''Fille du Regiment'' on Feb. 17, 1972.         Besides Salome and Aida, her Metropolitan Opera roles included Donna Anna in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' the title role in Puccini's ''Tosca,'' Rosalinde in Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus'' and Musetta in Puccini's ''Boheme.''         But most of Miss Welitsch's career was spent in Europe, where she was coached by the composer when she made her Vienna Opera debut in a special performance of ''Salome'' that celebrated Richard Strauss's 80th birthday in 1944.         Even when her career in grand opera faded, Miss Welitsch's love of performance kept her busy into the early 1980's in operetta, films, radio, television and on the stage.         She was born in Borissovo, on the Black Sea in Bulgaria, on July 10, 1913. As a child, she liked to sing and play the violin. By her teens she was taking singing lessons, and at 19 entered the Academy of Music in Vienna.         She began her professional career in 1936 with the Graz Opera Company, which played a 10-month season that enabled Miss Welitsch to build her repertory. From 1941 to 1943 she sang in Hamburg and from 1943 to 1946 in Munich. In 1943 she also joined the Vienna Opera, where she made her noteworthy debut in ''Salome'' the next year.         When she made her English debut with the company in 1947, she dazzled audiences at Covent Garden, and by 1948 she had sung Salome more than 50 times and appeared in more than 40 other roles. That summer, while abroad, Edward Johnson, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, heard Miss Welitsch and engaged her to sing in New York the following year.         In 1956, when she was 43, Miss Welitsch caused a stir in Vienna when she married Karl Schmalvogel, a 29-year-old traffic policeman who had assisted her after an accident a year earlier. They were divorced in 1969.         Miss Welitsch left no immediate survivors.       
         Edith Tilton Penrose, an American-born British economist who was an authority on corporate growth and on oil, died on Oct. 11 in Waterbeach -- near Cambridge, England -- where she lived. She was 81.         Her death was reported on Saturday by The Guardian and The Independent.         Dr. Penrose, whose doctorate was from Johns Hopkins University, retired in 1978 as a professor at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, where she concurrently headed the school's economics department. In later years she was a professor and a dean at the Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affaires in Fontainebleau, France.         Her best-known book is ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' (1959, Oxford), about the ways companies grow and the reasons why they do. Jay B. Barney, a professor of management at Ohio State University, writing in a management journal last year, called it a seminal work about ''the competitive implications of a firm's internal strengths and weaknesses.''         A Scottish economist, Sir Alec Cairncross, recalled in The Independent on Saturday, that the book brought Dr. Penrose ''instant recognition as a creative thinker, and its importance to the analysis of the job of management has been increasingly realized.''         In theorizing about companies, Dr. Penrose held that, as The Guardian  put it: ''There are important administrative restraints on the speed of the firm's growth. Human resources required for the management of change are tied to the individual firm and so are internally scarce. Expansion requires the recruitment of more such resources. New recruits cannot become fully effective overnight. The growth process is, therefore, dynamically constrained.''         Dr. Penrose's interest in oil originated in the late 1950's, when she was a visiting professor at the University of Baghdad. In a 1976 interview, she recalled: ''I was doing a book on multinational corporations, although nobody called them that in those days. Being in Iraq, it would have been rather silly not to concentrate on oil, wouldn't it?''         That book, ''The Large International Firm in Developing Countries: The International Petroleum Industry,'' was published in 1968, and by 1976 she was considered one of the top oil economists in the world.         In the 1976 interview, she said: ''Historically, the international oil companies often have wielded their vast power selfishly, although their accomplishments have often been beneficial to the world.'' By that time, oil executives had often been less than pleased with conclusions expressed in her writings, but she contended: ''I don't take sides. I just gather the facts and if people don't like my work, they just don't like the facts.''         Edith Tilton was born in Los Angeles and received a bachelor's degree in 1936 from the University of California at Berkeley. After working for the American Embassy in London, she received her doctorate in 1950. Her first book, ''Economics of the International Patent System,'' was published in 1951.         Dr. Penrose was a lecturer and research associate at Johns Hopkins for many years. Sir Alec wrote that after a campaign she and her husband, Ernest F. Penrose, a British-born economist and writer, ''conducted in support of Owen Lattimore, a professor accused of un-American activities,'' the couple ''fell afoul of McCarthy and were more or less exiled, first to the Australian National University in Canberra and then to Baghdad University.'' Then the couple moved to Britain.         Dr. Penrose married David Burton Denhardt in 1934; he died in 1938. She married Mr. Penrose in 1944; he died in 1984. Her survivors include three sons.       
         Fritz and Ingeborg Kahlenberg, exiled Germans who met during World War II as members of Hidden Camera, a Dutch Resistance group that documented the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, died this month at New York University Hospital within two weeks of each other.         The Kahlenbergs, who established Film Authors, a New York film production company after they immigrated to the United States in 1946, lived in Manhattan. Mr. Kahlenberg, 80, died on Oct. 15; Mrs. Kahlenberg, 76, died on Oct. 2.         The couple's daughter, Liz Kahlenberg Bordow, said her mother had died of lung cancer and her father of complications of kidney failure.         Working secretly, the Hidden Camera photographers, led by Mr. Kahlenberg, hoarded rationed film, snapped pictures with cameras concealed in coats or handbags, developed the photographs and, in some cases, tried to smuggle them out of the country.         Under the title ''The Illegal Camera: Photography in the Netherlands During the German Occupation, 1940-1945,'' an exhibition of 75 photographs taken by members of the Hidden Camera opened in August at the Jewish Museum, at Fifth Avenue and 92d Street, where it is to run until Dec. 1.         In addition to the persecution of the Jews, the photographs at the museum cover warfare and occupation, confiscation of goods, compulsory labor, resistance, the ''Hunger Winter'' of 1944-45 when starvation was rampant, and liberation.         One of the most widely known of the Hidden Camera photographs, taken by Cas Oorthuys and included by Edward Steichen in his collection ''The Family of Man,'' studies the face of a sunken-eyed woman gnawing on a crust of bread.         ''The pictures are painful to look at,'' Sarah Boxer wrote in her review in The New York Times.         Henry Kol, the Dutch consul for press and cultural affairs in New York, credited photographs taken by Hidden Camera with providing evidence that enabled the Dutch Government in exile to persuade the Red Cross to arrange food drops.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, who was taught by her husband to operate a camera, was also involved in resistance communications, transporting munitions and the use of forged documents.         Mr. Kahlenberg, who was born in Berlin, where his father was a founder of the U.F.A. film studio, settled in Amsterdam after Hitler came to power and was a film distributor when World War II began.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, whose maiden name was Wallheimer, was born in Bremen and moved to Amsterdam with her family in 1939.         The couple, cited by the Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, for their resistance activities, were married in 1946 and settled in New York.         For a time, Mr. Kahlenberg was a producer with Telenews, which provided newsreels to movie theaters. In the 1950's, the Kahlenbergs founded Film Authors, a production company.         They produced a wide variety of documentary and travel films for such clients as Pan American Airways, the Icelandic and Scandinavian Travel Bureaus, Holland America Lines and Bermuda. David Frost, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters were among the narrators.         In addition to their daughter, of Berkeley, Calif., they are survived by  a grandchild.         Mr. Kahlenberg is also survived by a brother, Hans Kahlenberg of Chiddingfold, England. Mrs. Kahlenberg is survived by a brother, Gunthur Wallheimer, and a sister, Helga Ekker, both of Amsterdam.       
         Lidiya Chukovskaya, the Russian writer who risked her life to record the horrors of Stalinism and speak out against the persecutions of dissidents in the Soviet Union, died on Wednesday at her home in Moscow. She was 88.         As a champion of human rights, Miss Chukovskaya criticized the trial of Andrei D. Sinyavsky and Yuli M. Daniel, who were jailed in the 1960's for their  satiric commentaries on the Soviet system. She also defended the dissident nuclear physicist Andrei D. Sakharov in 1973 and lent her country house to Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel Prize-winning author, before he was arrested and deported from the Soviet Union in 1974.         Ideas should be fought with ideas," she said, "not with camps and prisons."         In a statement yesterday, reported by The Associated Press, Mr. Solzhenitsyn  said: "Our literature has lost an exquisite connoisseur of Russian poetry and a  precious witness of the Soviet half-century. She preserved for us concealed treasures, which would have perished but for her."         Mr. Solzhenitsyn called Miss Chukovskaya an "incorruptible" and "passionate"  defender of writers and literature.         Miss Chukovskaya was 66, nearly blind and afflicted with a weak heart when her defense of Mr. Sakharov resulted in her expulsion from the Moscow Writers Union by a unanimous vote in 1974.         Accused of having "slipped into an anti-Soviet swamp," she was in effect blacklisted, since expulsion from the organization deprived writers of the means and the legal right to publish their work.         Summoned to a meeting with the union's secretary, Yuri F. Strekhinin, and another writer, A. M. Mednikov, she was questioned about her criticism of the treatment of dissidents.         "How do you know these things?" she said she was asked.         "From my life," Miss Chukovskaya said she answered. "From mothers, wives, sisters. In order not to see, you have to shut your eyes and cover your ears. It's all around."         "They put one of my friends who was completely healthy in an insane asylum,"  she later recounted having told them. "I knew he was healthy."         She said Mr. Mednikov asked her, "Why does all this happen around you and nothing like that happens around me?"         Miss Chukovskaya replied: "I don't know -- maybe you are living on an island. You make a special effort not to see."         Her differences with the authorities did not end with the breakup of the Soviet Union. When the Russian President, Boris N. Yeltsin, awarded Miss Chukovskaya a literary prize last year, she refused the money because she disagreed with Moscow's military campaign to keep Chechnya a part of Russia, said her longtime friend and English translator, Sylvia Rubashova, who lives in  London.         "She was very uncompromising," Mrs. Rubashova said.         The work that brought Miss Chukovskaya the prize was "The Akhmatova Journals," a recollection of her friendship with the great Russian poet Anna Akhmatova (1889-1966), who lost two husbands to Soviet repression.         Miss Chukovskaya was the daughter of a prominent writer and the widow of an author who died in the Stalinist purges of the 1930's. She was renowned for her  love of poetry and for a prodigious memory that enabled her to save countless poems from destruction by learning them by heart.         Among her other books were "Sofiya Petrovna," written in the winter of 1939-40 but not published until 1967, when it was smuggled to the West and issued under the title "The Deserted House."         The semi-autobiographical novel, set down while the memory of Stalin's Great  Purge was still fresh, conveyed the atmosphere of fear and terror that engulfed  the Soviet Union as the crackdown gathered force.         John J. Stephan, a friend who is a professor of history at the University of  Hawaii, said the manuscript of "Sofiya Petrovna" was passed along and hidden at  a time when its possession would have been tantamount to a death sentence.         She was also the author of "Going Under" (1976), a description of the corruption of writers by Soviet power.         Miss Chukovskaya's "To the Memory of Childhood," also published in 1988, was  a tribute to her father, Kornei Chukovsky, a Russian critic, translator and popular author of children's verse and fairy tales. Covering the years 1910 to 1917, it recalled her upbringing at the family home in Kuokkala on the Gulf of Finland.         Miss Chukovskaya was born on March 23, 1907 in Leningrad and spent her summers in Kuokkala. She served as her father's amanuensis, and in "To the Memory of Childhood" she described him as a humorous, fun-loving man who was passionate about language and fanatical about poetry.         She married M. P. Bronshtein, an eminent physicist who died in prison in 1938. For some years she worked as an editor for a children's book publisher in  Moscow.         Miss Chukovskaya is survived by her daughter, Yelena, of Moscow.
