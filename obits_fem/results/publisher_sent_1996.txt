Annabella, whose real name was Suzanne Georgette Charpentier, was the daughter of a French publisher.
She had also just completed a book, ''Frances Lear's Guide to Work and Family in the 21st Century,'' which does not yet have a publisher.
Mrs. Rey died from complications following a heart attack she suffered about three weeks ago, according to a statement released by her publisher Houghton Mifflin, in Boston.
It was in Paris, though, that a publisher expressed interest in a comic drawing of a giraffe by Hans Augusto.
The publisher then asked the couple to collaborate on a book for children.
Young Madga was 5 in 1939 when her father, Gyula Denes, a wealthy publisher, fled Budapest, abandoning his daughter, son and wife, who sought refuge in houses protected by Swiss diplomats.
She was elected guild unit chairwoman at The Post in 1976, while Dorothy Schiff was publisher.
When Rupert Murdoch bought the paper in 1977, she became the first Murdoch employee to lead a bargaining committee against the publisher.
She then joined Basic Books, a subsidiary of HarperCollins, as associate publisher, senior vice president and director of publicity and rights.
She was married three times: to the literary critic Cyril Connolly from 1950 to 1956; to the publisher George Weidenfeld from 1956 to 1961, and briefly to Derek Jackson, a newspaper heir, in 1966.
For some years she worked as an editor for a children's book publisher in  Moscow.
