         Dixy Lee Ray, former chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Governor of Washington, died yesterday at her home on Fox Island, near Tacoma. She was 79.         She had suffered for some months from a severe bronchial condition, said a friend, Lou Guzzo, who is a television commentator.         Dr. Ray, a marine biologist who championed the nuclear industry, was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to the atomic commission in 1972, and served as chairwoman from 1973 to 1975. During her tenure, she raised eyebrows in the nation's capital by living in a mobile home and taking her dogs to the office.         In 1974, she underscored the finding of an Atomic Energy Commission study of nuclear power plant safety: that the chance of mass destruction from a reactor accident was as unlikely as that of a meteor striking an urban area. "There is no question that the nuclear industry comes off very well," she said.         She issued her latest no-nonsense commentary on nuclear issues on Thursday, when she dismissed reports about cold-war-era Federal radiation experiments as alarmist.         "Everybody is exposed to radiation," Dr. Ray was quoted by The Associated Press as saying, adding, "A little bit more or a little bit less is of no consequence." Criticizing Kissinger         The Atomic Energy Commission was eventually abolished and its duties were transferred to the new Energy Research and Development Administration. Dr. Ray was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 as Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans, International Environment and Scientific Affairs.         She resigned from the post later that year, contending that Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger had ignored her office on policy matters.         It was as a Democrat that Dr. Ray was elected in 1976 to one term as the only female Governor her state has had, becoming the nation's second woman to be elected Governor without succeeding her husband. Ella T. Grasso, a Democrat, had been elected Governor of Connecticut two years before.         Dr. Ray, after her surprise victory, said that she supported the Equal Rights Amendment but that women should "stop brooding about being a woman." She told women, "If you want to do something, then train yourself and you've got to be willing to work."         Governor Ray a conservative in fiscal matters and was praised by a lobbyist in the aircraft industry as "the best friend business ever had."         She also angered environmentalists with her support of nuclear power, unhampered growth and oil supertankers.         But she could also be stern in the environmental sphere. In 1979, she ordered the low-level nuclear waste dump at a Federal reservation in Hanford, Wash., one of only three in the nation, closed temporarily after inspectors had found that some radioactive material was being hauled in unsafe trucks.         In 1980, Dr. Ray herself faced a environmental problem when Mount St. Helens repeatedly erupted, ravaging parts of the state with volcanic mud flows, flooding and ash.         While Dr. Ray was Governor, the power of her intellect and her skill as a speaker gave her an aura of great competence. But she was sharp-tongued, highly unconventional for a politician in high office, and became entangled in disputes with reporters and with other public officials.         Dr. Ray was also burdened by disaffection in her own party going into the 1980 Democratic primary and suffered a startling defeat at the hands of State Senator Jim McDermott, who offered himself as "a Governor who listens."         She was christened Margaret at her birth in 1914 in Tacoma, but she later chose the name Dixy Lee. She climbed Mount Rainier, her state's tallest peak, at age 12 -- becoming the youngest girl to do so -- and went on to graduate in 1937 from Mills College, where she also earned a master's degree. She received a doctorate in zoology from Stanford in 1945.         She taught at schools in Oakland, Calif., from 1938 to 1942 and was an associate professor of zoology at the University of Washington from 1945 to 1976.         With Mr. Guzzo she wrote two books: "Trashing the Planet: How Science Can Help Us Deal With Acid Rain, Depletion of the Ozone, and Nuclear Waste (Among Other Things)," published in 1990, and "Environmental Overkill," published this year.         She is survived by her sisters, Marion Reid of Fox Island, Dr. Jean Ray of Long Beach, Calif., Julianna Strong of Salem, Ore., and Elvista Steele of Klatskanie, Ore.       
         Mildred Gilman Wohlforth, who wrote books and magazine articles and was a New York newspaperwoman during the Roaring Twenties, died on Monday at her home in Ridgefield, Conn. She was 97.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Robert M. Wohlforth.         Mrs. Wohlforth's breathless coverage of flappers, bootleggers, love nests and trunk murders earned her a reputation as one of journalism's first sob sisters.         She was a friend and confidante of Harold Ross, the first editor of The New Yorker magazine, and she knew Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, Christopher Morley and other members of what came to be known as the Algonquin Round Table.         Among the dozens of murders that Mrs. Wohlforth covered for The New York Journal was the notorious Triple X murder case, which involved a serial killer who preyed on couples in lovers' lanes.         Her first novel, "Fig Leaves," was published shortly after she graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1919. Mrs. Wohlforth later became secretary to the columnist and author Heywood Broun and wrote a second novel, "Headlines."         Her articles appeared in Redbook, American Mercury, Reader's Digest, and McCall's. In 1931 Hollywood made a film of her third book, "Sob Sister," which she defined as "a reporter who almost literally sobbed with the victim, the culprit, the families of both."         She is survived by her husband of 63 years; two sons, Eric E., of Anchorage, and Timothy A., of Oakland, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Natalie Molostwoff, a former executive director of the School of American Ballet, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         The cause was cancer, said Nathalie Gleboff, the current executive director of the school, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet.         Ms. Molostwoff, whose original name was Natalie Merimanova, was a native of Baku, Azerbaijan, and emigrated to New York City with her mother when she was a girl. In later years, she became a secretary and was hired by the School of American Ballet in 1938.         Eugenie Ouroussow, the school's director at the time, soon discovered that Ms. Molostwoff possessed administrative skills. She became Ms. Ouroussow's assistant. When Ms. Ouroussow died in 1976, Ms. Molostwoff succeeded her as executive director, holding that post until she retired in 1991.         Ms. Molostwoff's first marriage ended in divorce, but she continued to use her married surname professionally.         She is survived by her second husband, the choreographer John Taras.       
         Madelin Thayer Gilpatric, a volunteer for almost five decades for several nonprofit organizations in New York City and California, died last Thursday at New York Hospital. She was in her 80's.         The cause of death was a cerebral hemorrhage, according to her family.         Mrs. Gilpatric was a founder and past vice president of the Society of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center of New York City. She also served on the board of the California Institute of Arts in Valencia for 36 years and of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York City for 17 years.         In addition, she worked with the Lighthouse for the Blind, the American Cancer Society, the Institute for Religion and Psychology and the International Press Institute.         Mrs. Gilpatric, a graduate of Syracuse University, was the widow of Arthur Kudner, whose advertising agency bore his name. Her marriage to Roswell Gilpatric, Deputy Secretary of Defense during the Kennedy Administration, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two brothers, Albert Thayer of Baldwin, L.I., and John Thayer of Norfolk, Va.; a son, Arthur Kudner of Grasonville, Md.; a daughter, Karyl McKay of Alanson, Mich., and six grandchildren.       
         Esther Sherman, a theatrical agent and a vice president of the William Morris Agency, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Hospital in Manhattan. She was 56.         The cause was cancer, the agency said.         Ms. Sherman was a native of Newark. She joined William Morris in 1964 as a secretary in the Chicago office and was promoted to assistant in the personal appearance department in New York in 1962. She became an agent in 1973.         One of her first clients was Howard Ashman, who went on to write "Little Shop of Horrors" and "The Little Mermaid." She also represented Edward Albee, Athol Fugard, John Patrick Shanley and Charles Fuller, among others.         She is survived by her brother and sister-in-law, Allan and Susan Sherman, of Toms River, N.J.       
         Dorothy Flagg Leet, who directed the forerunner of the Reid Hall campus of Columbia University in Paris for over 30 years, died on Thursday at Meadow Lakes nursing home in Heightstown, N.J. She was 99.         Under Miss Leet's leadership, Reid Hall became the focal point of interest in French-American cultural cooperation for many young American women students. It drew lecturers and guests in the arts, science, literature and public affairs and was also used as a residence hall for students.         In 1924 Miss Leet became the second director of what was then the American University Women's Club in Paris, an 18th-century house at 4 Rue de Chevreuse in Montparnasse. The name was changed in 1928 to honor its patron, Mrs. Whitelaw Reid, wife of an American minister to France in the 1880's.         Miss Leet left Paris in 1938 to become national secretary to the Foreign Policy Association in New York, returning to Reid Hall in 1946. She retired as president emeritus in 1964 when Reid Hall was turned over to Columbia.         Miss Leet also served from 1953 to 1956 as president of the International Federation of University Women. She was a 1917 alumna of Barnard College. Miss Leet received many awards for her cultural and scholastic activities, and in 1949 the French Government awarded her the rank of officer of the Legion of Honor.       
         Marie T. Mandry, who over 36 years in the advertising business rose from a secretary to senior vice president of Young & Rubicam in New York, died Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, said her brother, Gerard Mandry.         Miss Mandry joined Young & Rubicam after graduating from Marymount College in Tarrytown. When she retired in 1985 she oversaw the agency's account management department.         She is survived by her brother, of Dobbs Ferry.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Elizabeth Birdsall Burdick, the founding director of the International Theater Institute Library in New York, died last Friday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         She had a heart attack in her home, her family said.         A native of Haddonville, N.J., Mrs. Burdick graduated from Wellesley College and the Yale Drama School. She began her career as a production secretary on Broadway.         In 1969, she founded and organized the library for the institute and served as its archivist and curator until her retirement in 1988. The library holds resource materials from 146 countries and about 13,000 foreign play scripts.         Mrs. Burdick is survived by her husband, John; two sons, Owen of Jersey City and Richard of Manhattan; her brother, Robert Birdsall of Haddonfield, and two grandchildren.       
         Fiona Baan, the director of dressage and driving programs for the United States Equestrian Team, died on Sunday at her home in Chester, N.J. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, a team spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Baan was responsible for training this country's international teams in driving and dressage and coordinated national championships from which the United States Olympic team was selected.         In the international sport of driving, either four or two horses are guided by one driver in a carriage. In dressage, a rider controls a horse through a series of intricate movements. A Bronze Medal         A highlight of her career came in 1992 at the Barcelona Olympics when the American dressage squad took the bronze after 16 years without an Olympic medal in that competition.         Mrs. Baan's job covered all aspects of administering the two disciplines for the United States Equestrian Team, with headquarters in Gladstone, N.J. She managed the teams for the North American Dressage Championships in 1985 and 1989; the 1986 World Dressage Championships, and the 1989 and 1991 Pairs World Driving Championships.         She managed the 1989, 1990 and 1991 Olympic dressage teams and served as chef d'equipe, or team manager, for the dressage team at the 1987 Pan American Games. In 1991, she helped organize the Equestrian Team's Festival of Champions, having previously set up dressage championships and selection trials at Gladstone.         Born in Scotland, Mrs. Baan took up riding in the Cotswolds in England. She became versed in all its sports aspects, including dressage and show jumping. She entered the hotel business and worked in England, Bermuda, Florida and Nevada before settling in New Jersey.         She hunted with the hounds and successfully competed herself while working for the Equestrian Team. She began with the team in 1966 as a secretary.         Mrs. Baan is survived by her husband, Leslie, and a daughter, Natalie.       
         Catherine Damon Christy, a former president of the Young Women's Christian Association of Brooklyn and a former member of the boards of various charitable organizations, died on Wednesday at her home in Wilton, Conn. She was 96 and formerly lived in Brooklyn Heights.         The cause was cardiac arrest. She had been suffering from arteriosclerotic heart disease, said Joseph Pagliaro of the Hoyt Funeral Home in New Canaan, Conn.         Mrs. Christy did volunteer work for years with the Brooklyn Y.W.C.A. and was its president from 1944 to 1953. She was also a longtime member of its board.         In addition, she was a member of the national Y.W.C.A. board from 1947 to 1967 and was variously a member of its executive committee, its committee on racial inclusiveness and other panels.         Mrs. Christy also served on the boards of the Visiting Nurse Association of Brooklyn and the Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service, and was secretary of the National United Service Organization from 1957 to 1968.         A native of Pulaski, Va., she received a Bachelor of Science degree from Simmons College in Boston in 1920 and was later employed as a librarian.         She married Francis T. Christy, a lawyer, in 1922. He died in 1979.         She is survived by two sons, Arthur H. of Manhattan and Dr. Francis T. Christy of Washington; five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Margie Pitts Hames, an Atlanta civil rights lawyer who argued a companion case to the better-known Roe v. Wade, in which the Supreme Court upheld a woman's right to have an abortion, died on Tuesday night while driving her car in Atlanta. She was 60.         According to the police there, she suffered a heart attack, and her car went off the road and into a parking lot. She was pronounced dead at Piedmont Hospital a short while later.         Ms. Hames argued Doe v. Bolton, a suit from Georgia concerning restrictions on sites where abortions could be performed, which ran parallel to Roe v. Wade, a Texas case. The Supreme Court ruled on the two cases on Jan. 22, 1973. Ms. Hames called the decision "a cornerstone for liberating women."         Born in Milton, Tenn., she was a legal secretary when she started studying law at Middle Tennessee State University. She transferred to Vanderbilt University, where she earned bachelor's and law degrees.         She started practicing law in 1962, specializing in labor-management relations. She ran unsuccessfully for the Georgia Supreme Court 12 years ago.         Ms. Hames and several other Atlanta lawyers put the Doe v. Bolton case together in 1970 as a constitutional challenge to Georgia's abortion law. "Doe," like "Roe," was a woman with an unwanted pregnancy who had been unable to get a legal abortion. Ms. Hames was the main lawyer in the case when it came before the United States Supreme Court.         She was less successful in another instance as a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union. A lawsuit filed in 1972 sought to end persistent segregation in the Atlanta schools by busing pupils across city, county and district lines in a six-county region. The Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that there was no basis for ordering such a sweeping busing plan.         Ms. Hames's survivors include a son, Adam, and a daughter, Donia.       
         Joan Harrison, a producer and screenwriter who helped write the scripts for "Rebecca," "Foreign Correspondent" and other films directed by Alfred Hitchcock, died on Aug. 14 in London. She was 83.         Miss Harrison was born in Guildford, Surrey, England, where her father published two local newspapers. After attending boarding school in Kent, she received an honor's degree in philosophy, politics and economics at St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where she occasionally reviewed films for the student newspaper. She later studied at the Sorbonne.         In 1933, she was hired as a secretary by Hitchcock, who was at work on "The Man Who Knew Too Much." A poor secretary by her own description, she soon graduated to reading books and scripts, writing synopses and contributing to scripts. She received her first writing credit on Hitchcock's "Jamaica Inn." From Hitchcock to Hollywood         In 1939, Miss Harrison accompanied Hitchcock to Hollywood, working as his assistant and as a writer on "Rebecca," "Suspicion," "Saboteur" and "Shadow of a Doubt."         In 1941, Miss Harrison went out on her own and was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to write the script for "The Sun Is My Undoing." In 1943, she was hired as a producer at Universal, where her first film was "Phantom Lady," a melodrama starring Franchot Tone. In 1944, she produced and shared the screenwriting credit for "Dark Waters," a thriller starring Merle Oberon.         In the 1940's and 50's, she produced the mystery thrillers "Third Eye," "Uncle Harry," "Nocturne," "Ride the Pink Horse," "Once More, My Darling," "Eye Witness" and "Circle of Danger."         From 1955 to 1962, she produced the television series "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." With Norman Lloyd, she was responsible for selecting stories, hiring writers and directors, casting and supervising the production of each episode. She also produced the television series "Journey Into the Unknown."         She is survived by her husband, the mystery writer Eric Ambler.       
         Christine Lynn Potts, a Russian affairs expert on the staff of the National Security Council at the White House, died on Thursday at her home in Arlington, Va. She was 36.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Miss Potts, who was from Zanesville, Ohio, received a bachelor's degree in political science from Smith College and, in 1982, a master's degree in Russian studies from the University of Michigan. She began her career at the Brookings Institution as a research assistant on Soviet energy and economics.         She then spent two years at the Kennan Institute in Washington and went to work for the Central Intelligence Agency in 1987. She joined the staff of the National Security Council in 1992, specializing in Russian, Ukrainian and Eurasian affairs. At the security council she was the principal policy assistant on the economies of the republics of the former Soviet Union.         Miss Potts also served as the executive secretary of a commission established by Vice President Al Gore and Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin of Russia to foster economic and technological cooperation between the two nations. In that capacity, she helped to arrange the panel's first meeting last September.         She is survived by her parents, Robert and Jean Potts of Callawassie Island, S.C.; and two brothers, Mark, of Bozeman, Mont., and Jeff, of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Felisa Rincon de Gautier, Mayor of San Juan, P.R., from 1946 to 1969 and the only woman to hold that post, died on Friday in a nursing home in San Juan, where she had lived in recent months. She was 97.         She died after suffering a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.         She was appointed Mayor in 1946 to replace an incumbent who had resigned, and she was elected to office in later years. Running for another four-year term in 1964, she said, "After this term I want to lead my own life," and she did not run for re-election in 1968. Her other political work included membership on the Democratic National Committee.         Even before she became Mayor, Mrs. Rincon de Gautier, widely known as Dona Fela, worked on behalf of social causes, including the campaign to win Puerto Rican women the right to vote, which succeeded in 1932.         It was then that she went into politics, going on to press for child-care programs, centers for the elderly and legal aid for the poor. Her political power came in large part from the support of the city's poor residents, whom she organized within her Popular Democratic Party.         She worked hard to please the electorate. "My opponents campaign just before elections and then they disappear," she once said. "I start campaigning the day after the election and never stop."         She was also good at political repartee. After detractors said she had given city jobs to too many of her relatives, she replied: "I wish I had 20 more nieces. They work better -- for less."         As Mayor, she had a highly personal style that included enchanting local children by flying in planeloads of snow for Christmas parties. She maintained that personal touch even as San Juan grew, from a population of 180,000 when she first took office to 600,000 by 1961, when she was still meeting once a week with residents who needed advice or assistance.         But she also attended to larger matters, like public works. She was proud of having provided the city with well-equipped and hospitably managed dispensaries, as well as new schools and housing projects with nurseries and other amenities.         After stepping down as Mayor, she maintained her interest in politics. In 1992, at the age of 95, she was the oldest delegate to the Democratic National Convention, which was held in New York.         The eldest of eight children of a lawyer, she was born in Ceiba, 33 miles southeast of San Juan. She had to leave school at age 15 to care for her siblings.         Early in her life, she was a supporter of independence for Puerto Rico, but her views changed, and she went on to support the United States Commonwealth Constitution that came into effect in 1952.         In 1940, she married Jenaro A. Gautier, a lawyer who was secretary general of the Popular Democratic Party at the time. He died in 1971.       
         Amy Clampitt, known for her dense, ornate and allusive poetry, died on Saturday at her home in Lenox, Mass. She was 74 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Anne Close, her editor at Alfred A. Knopf.         Ms. Clampitt published her first full-length book of poetry, "The Kingfisher," when she was 63. It was a delayed but auspicious beginning. Richard Tillinghast, in The New York Times Book Review, wrote that the author "immediately merits consideration as one of our most distinguished contemporary poets." The work, which challenged readers with long strings of dependent clauses, an often obscure vocabulary and arcane literary allusions, ran counter to the prevailing taste for pared-down, plain speech. Instead, she offered "baroque profusion, the romance of the adjective, labyrinthine syntax, a festival lexicon," the poet Alfred Corn wrote in a review.         Ms. Clampitt was born in New Providence, Iowa, and grew up on a 125-acre farm. After earning a bachelor's degree with honors in English at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, in 1941 she studied at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research.         She worked as a secretary and a writer at Oxford University Press from 1943 to 1951 and as reference librarian at the National Audubon Society from 1952 to 1959. Through the 1960's and most of the 70's, she was a freelance writer, editor and researcher. From 1977 to 1982 she was an editor at E. P. Dutton. Initially Self-Published         In college, Ms. Clampitt succumbed to the spell of Gerard Manley Hopkins, but she wrote little poetry at the time. In the 1950's, she made unsuccessful stabs at novel writing. It was not until the 60's that she began writing poetry in earnest, initially without success. In 1974, at her own expense, she published a poetry chapbook, "Multitudes, Multitudes." The work caught the eye of Howard Moss, the poetry editor of The New Yorker, who began publishing Ms. Clampitt regularly. In 1981, a second small collection, "The Isthmus," was published.         "The Kingfisher," published in 1983 by Alfred A. Knopf, immediately pushed its author to the front ranks of American poets. Organized around the elements earth, air, fire and water, it treated subjects as various as the plants and marine life of New England, John Lennon's murder, the Holocaust and the Vietnam War.         Comparing Ms. Clampitt to Hopkins, Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, critics noted her pinpoint descriptions of the natural world that led to unexpected metaphysical insights and conclusions. She once referred to herself as "a poet of place," a characterization that she later revised to "a poet of displacement." From Life and Myth         "What the Light Was Like" (1985, Knopf) solidified its author's reputation. Like "The Kingfisher," it began with several poems about the New England coast, notably the book's title poem, an elegy for a drowned lobsterman.         In "Archaic Figure" (1987, Knopf), inspired in part by the author's travels in Greece, Ms. Clampitt used Greek myth to explore what Virginia Woolf called "the ancient consciousness of women." Her other major collections were "Westward" (1990, Knopf) and "A Silence Opens" (1994, Knopf).         She also published an essay collection, "Predecessors, et Cetera" (1991, University of Michigan Press) and edited "The Essential Donne" (1988, Ecco Press).         Ms. Clampitt received a fellowship award for distinguished poetic achievement from the Academy of American Poets in 1982 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1992. She was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.         She is survived by her husband, Harold L. Korn; two brothers, Lawrence, of Brunswick, Me., and Philip, of Auburn Hills, Mich., and a sister, Beth, of Carlisle, Iowa.       
         Margaret Janus, who helped her brother, Dr. Jack Kevorkian, in assisted suicides, died today at Sinai Hospital here. She was 68 and lived in Troy, Mich.         The cause was a heart attack, said her physician, Dr. Stanley Levy.         Mrs. Janus, who was called Margo, kept all the patient records involving the assisted suicides, and videotaped sessions between her brother and the 20 patients he helped commit suicide since 1990. She was present at the first 15 of the suicides, and later helped organize meetings of the survivors of Dr. Kevorkian's patients. She also worked in Dr. Kevorkian's campaign for a statewide referendum on doctor-assisted suicide.         "She was my record-keeper, my videographer and my chronicler," Dr. Kevorkian said. "She was also my supporter when I had no other supporters."         She was born in Pontiac, Mich., and was an executive secretary for various companies, including the Chrysler Corporation.         Mrs. Janus was divorced. In addition to her brother, she is survived by her daughter, Ava, of Troy, and a sister, Flora Holzheimer, of Schmalwasser, Germany.       
         Mildred Natwick, a versatile actress who created an engaging gallery of eccentric, whimsical and spunky characters in plays, films and television for more than 60 years, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Miss Natwick, a small woman with sharp features and a mischievous manner, was a familiar figure on the Broadway stage, where she appeared in some 40 productions. Among other roles, she played an idiosyncratic secretary in George Bernard Shaw's "Candida," an extroverted medium in Noel Coward's "Blithe Spirit" and a shrewish wife in Jean Anouilh's "Waltz of the Toreadors."         The New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson, in his review of the Anouilh play in 1957, characterized her performance as "protean" and one that "rides the whirlwind with a great sweep of venomous extravagance."         Miss Natwick's comic brilliance in Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park" prompted Walter Kerr to acclaim her in 1963 as "the most hilarious woman in the Western hemisphere." She further confirmed her versatility in 1970 in Harold Pinter's "Landscape" and in 1971 when, at the age of 62, she made her debut in a singing role in a John Kander-Fred Ebb musical, "70, Girls, 70," as the disarming leader of a circle of elderly people seeking self-esteem by stealing furs.         Among Miss Natwick's films were four directed by John Ford. She appeared as a prostitute in "The Long Voyage Home," a doomed mother in "The Three Godfathers," a hard-bitten Army wife in "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon" and a sly widow in "The Quiet Man."         In a 1990 interview, she praised Ford as a masterly director who needed just a few words to inspire actors and give them the right clue or insight for a scene. In contrast, she said, Alfred Hitchcock, in directing the comedy "The Trouble With Harry," told her and the other actors precisely what he wanted.         Miss Natwick concentrated her career on Broadway, saying she had always preferred plays to movies because "on the stage, you're in control for two hours, while in a film, you do bits and pieces, usually out of sequence."         She received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her work in the 1967 film version of "Barefoot in the Park." She also received several Tony and Emmy nominations and was awarded an Emmy for "The Snoop Sisters," a 1973-74 television series in which she and Helen Hayes played successful mystery writers who were obsessed with solving real crimes.         In an interview in her Park Avenue apartment, she said her main criterion for creating a role was to make a character as inseparable from herself as possible. Nearly everything, she remarked, "is hit or miss for a while, until it all comes together." She said her advice to young performers was: "Act every time you get a chance. At least in the beginning, go wherever acting is."         Miss Natwick, who was called Milly by friends and associates, was born in Baltimore on June 19, 1905, to Joseph Natwick, a businessman, and the former Mildred Marion Dawes. She graduated from the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore and also from Bennett Junior College in Dutchess County, N.Y., where she majored in drama.         She began performing at the age of 21 with the Vagabonds, a nonprofessional group in Baltimore. She soon joined the celebrated University Players on Cape Cod, trading lines with such other young performers as Henry Fonda, James Stewart, Margaret Sullavan and Joshua Logan. She made her Broadway debut in the melodrama "Carry Nation" in 1932.         Among her films were "The Enchanted Cottage" (1945), "The Late George Apley" (1947), "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950), "The Court Jester" (1956), "If It's Tuesday This Must Be Belgium" (1967), "Daisy Miller" (1974) and "Dangerous Liaisons" (1988)         No immediate family members survive.         Correction:  November 8, 1994, Tuesday         An obituary on Oct. 26 about the actress Mildred Natwick referred incorrectly to her debut in a singing role in a musical. It was in "Stars in Your Eyes" in 1939, not in "70, Girls, 70" in 1971.       
         Mary G. Roebling, former chairwoman of the National State Bank, one of New Jersey's largest independent banks, and a former governor of the American Stock Exchange, died on Tuesday at her home in Trenton. She was 89.         The cause was renal failure, The Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Roebling retired in 1984 as chairman of the National State Bank in Elizabeth, N.J., which then had assets of $1.2 billion.         Earlier, she became the first woman to head a major American bank, the Trenton Trust Company. In 1937, at the age of 30, she was named its president. It grew substantially and she was its president or chairman or both until 1972, when Trenton Trust was acquired by National State. She was then elected chairman of the combined institutions.         Mrs. Roebling was also a founder, in 1978, of the Women's Bank N.A. of Denver, the first nationally chartered bank founded by women. She went on to serve as its chairman until 1983. In addition, she was the American Stock Exchange's first woman governor, from 1958 to 1962.         Mrs. Roebling also served as a director of numerous other corporations over the years, was active in many civic, charitable and educational organizations, and was a tireless advocate of a greater role for women in the country's economic affairs.         In a speech in 1965, Mrs. Roebling said: "As a woman who for years has competed in the business world, I would be the first to agree that the American woman has almost unbelievable economic power, but American women, like women of all civilized nations, do not use the influence their economic power gives them."         Mrs. Roebling's own economic power came initially through inheritance, but she increased it vastly once it fell into her hands. She was bequeathed a large block of Trenton Trust stock by her millionaire second husband, Siegfried Roebling, whose family had long been prominent in engineering and cable manufacturing. He was a great-grandson of John A. Roebling, who designed the Brooklyn Bridge, and a grandson of Col. Washington A. Roebling, who completed its construction.         Siegfried Roebling died in 1936, of a heart attack. Mrs. Roebling's father and father-in-law then urged her to try her hand at running the bank. She had preparation for the job: she had worked for a Philadelphia investment house while taking business courses at night and, the two men told her, she had another important qualification, common sense.         The rest was banking history. She took her husband's seat on the bank's board and, on Jan. 21, 1937, was elected president.         "Mary G. Roebling didn't wait for women's lib," Forbes magazine once wrote, "she was ahead of it, way ahead."         By 1970, Mrs. Roebling estimated that 300 other American women had become presidents or chairwomen of banks. But in 1978, when she became chairwoman of the Women's Bank, she argued that there still was a place in the business world for banks that were operated specifically for female customers.         "Women's banks can be better listeners for women and give them more time, advice and direction than an ordinary bank would give," she told an interviewer. "It's a psychological thing, really."         She continued to be active in male-dominated spheres, however: in 1978, after having served as a civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army in several administrations, she became the founding president of the newly formed Army War College Foundation. It was set up to support the college's fund-raising and other activities.         She was born Mary Gindhart in 1907 in West Collingswood, N.J., the daughter of Isaac D. Gindhart Jr., a telephone company executive, and Mary Simon Gindhart, a music teacher. She went to public schools in Haddonfield and Moorestown, N.J., and earned pocket money picking strawberries for a penny a box.         While still a teen-ager, she married a musician, Arthur Herbert, but he died three years later, leaving her with a daughter to support. She went to work in Philadelphia and took evening courses in merchandising and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania.         She left her job when she married Mr. Roebling, becoming a housewife again until his death.         Over the years, Mrs. Roebling was variously a director of the Tattersall Corporation, the Standard Fire Insurance Company and the Colonial Operating Company, in Trenton, among other concerns; an officer of the New York World's Fair Corporation in 1964 and 1965; a member of the National Business Council on Consumer Affairs and of the Boy Scouts of America's national advisory council, and an active participant in other nonprofit organizations. She was awarded numerous honorary degrees and other honors.         She is survived by a daughter, Betty Hobin of Palm Beach, Fla., and Hopewell Township, N.J.; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and a sister, Margaret G. Finley of Haddonfield, N.J. A son, Paul Roebling, died in July.       
         Virginia E. Montes, a former national secretary and lobbyist for the National Organization for Women, died Thursday at her home in Atlanta. She was 50.         The cause was a stroke, the Atlanta medical examiner's office said.         Ms. Montes, a native of Honduras, had been active in NOW for 13 years and was the first Latin American woman to serve as a national officer of the organization.         She was elected secretary of NOW and of its national political action committee in 1991 and served until last year. In the spring of 1993 she led the organization's defense of Lani Guinier, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was nominated by President Clinton to head the Justice Department's civil rights division. The President withdrew the nomination after conservatives criticized Ms. Guinier for papers she had written on ways for blacks to increase their influence in elections.         Earlier, Ms. Montes was involved in NOW's lobbying efforts while serving as its government liaison officer. In two terms on the organization's national board she headed the committee for racial diversity.         Ms. Montes, who was known as Ginny, came to the United States when she was 10 years old. She was a delegate to three Democratic national conventions and frequently lobbied for civil rights groups in the halls of Southern state legislatures. One cause she advocated was the redrawing of election districts to strengthen minority representation.         In 1980 she became director of legislative research for the Southern Regional Council, based in Georgia. For a time she directed the Georgia Housing Coalition, but later returned to the council, where she was a senior consultant.         She also conducted leadership training activities for NOW, the American Civil Liberties Union, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Women's Political Caucus and other groups.         Ms. Montes is survived by a daughter, Rebecca Albury of Atlanta; her mother, Greta Hyde Montes of Tampa, Fla.; two sisters, Greta Montes of Wayne, Pa., and Jacqueline Zaborski of West Palm Beach, Fla., and three brothers, Robert, of Clearwater, Fla., and Ronald and Hiram, both of Tampa.       
         Carmen McRae, the jazz singer known for her probing interpretations of lyrics and her bruised but unbowed point of view, died on Thursday evening at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 74.         She had fallen into a semi-coma four days earlier, a month after being hospitalized for a stroke, said her secretary, Jan March. She withdrew from public performance in May 1991 after an episode of respiratory failure only hours after she completed an engagement at the Blue Note jazz club in New York.         Although Ms. McRae never reached the heights of popularity attained by Ella Fitzgerald, Sarah Vaughan and Billie Holiday, she was widely regarded as their artistic equal. In a prolific recording career that spanned nearly five decades, she had only two minor hits, both in the mid-1950's. But the scores of songs on she which stamped her bittersweet, gently mocking signature included "Alfie," "The Music That Makes Me Dance," "Guess Who I Saw Today?," "Blame It on My Youth," "Yesterdays" and "Mean to Me." In January, she received a National Endowment for the Arts Jazz Fellowship award for lifetime achievement.         Ms. McRae was born in Harlem on April 8, 1920, one of four children of immigrants from the West Indies. Growing up in Brooklyn, she attended Julia Richman High School in Manhattan and received her musical grounding in five years of formal piano lessons.         Like many other jazz giants of her generation, she had her first break when she won an amateur talent contest at the Apollo Theater in Harlem. It was there that she was discovered in 1939 by Irene Kitchings, who was then married to the jazz pianist Teddy Wilson. Through Wilson, who worked with Billie Holiday, Ms. McRae met the woman who became her biggest influence and who recorded Ms. McRae's song "Dream of Life."         "If Billie Holiday had never existed," Ms. McRae later recalled, "I probably wouldn't have, either."         Ms. McRae's parents, who opposed a show-business career, persuaded their daughter to take a secretarial course, and she spent two years in Washington doing clerical work for the Government. Returning to Brooklyn in 1943, she did office work by day while performing in clubs at night. Gradually music took over, and she began substituting for other singers in bands led by Benny Carter, Count Basie and Earl (Fatha) Hines. She eventually landed an 18-month engagement with a band led by Mercer Ellington, Duke's son, and in 1946 she made her recording debut with the band, singing under the name Carmen Clarke.         In Chicago, when the Ellington band broke up, Ms. McRae remained there and embarked on a solo career. A two-week engagement in a club as a singing pianist expanded to 17 weeks, and she ended up staying in Chicago three and a half years.         Her career took off when she returned to New York and developed an act as a stand-up singer at Minton's Playhouse in Harlem, receiving enough notice to be named best new female singer by Down Beatmagazine.         Ms. McRae released her first solo album for Bethlehem in 1955, the same year she made her first recordings for Decca, where she remained until 1958. From there she moved to Kapp (1958-60) and Columbia (1960-62), then jumped to several smaller labels before ending up on Atlantic for five years (1967-71). Her longest record company affiliation was with Concord Jazz (1980-88). Her last two albums, for RCA, were tributes to Thelonious Monk and Sarah Vaughan.         In these four decades as a jazz star, Ms. McRae toured constantly. Although she left New York for Southern California in the late 1960's, she appeared in New York regularly, usually at the Blue Note, where she did two engagements a year through most of the 1980's.         From the moment she made her mark, Ms. McRae was recognized as a supremely insightful interpreter of lyrics.         "Every word is very important to me," she said. "Lyrics come first, then the melody. The lyric of a song I might decide to sing must have something that I can convince you with. It's like an actress who selects a role that contains something she wants to portray."         The singer's two marriages, to the be-bop drummer Kenny Clarke and the pianist Ike Isaacs, both ended in divorce. There was no immediate word on survivors.       
         Catherine Filene Shouse, the philanthropist and arts patron who was the founder and major benefactor of the Wolf Trap Farm Park for the Performing Arts in Virginia, died yesterday at her home in Naples, Fla. She was 98 and also had homes in Washington, Easton, Md., and Vienna, Va., where Wolf Trap is situated.         The cause of death was heart failure, said Carol Harford, a longtime friend who is president emeritus of the Wolf Trap Foundation, which presents the park's arts programs under the auspices of the Department of the Interior.         Mrs. Shouse, the heiress to a retailing fortune, was a lifelong champion of the performing arts whose accomplishments and philanthropic ventures earned recognition from the highest quarters. In 1977, President Gerald Ford gave her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. A year earlier, Queen Elizabeth II had made her Dame Commander of the British Empire. This past October, she was among 12 Americans to receive the National Medal of Arts.         Catherine Filene was born in Boston in 1896. Her grandfather, William Filene, was the founder of the Filene's department-store chain, and her father, Lincoln Filene, founded Federated Department Stores. She graduated from Wheaton College in Norton, Mass., in 1918, and earned a master's degree in education at Harvard University in 1923.         Over seven decades, Mrs. Shouse held a remarkable variety of public and private posts. In 1919, she became the first woman appointed to the Democratic National Committee, and in the mid-1920's, she served under President Calvin Coolidge as chairwoman of the First Federal Prison for Women, where she instituted a job training and rehabilitation program.         In the 1940's, she became a dog breeder, importing hunting dogs from Germany and Switzerland and starting her own kennel at Wolf Trap Farm, a tract of land across the Potomac River, 15 miles west of Washington, that she had purchased in 1930.         In 1949, she joined the National Symphony Orchestra's board, and she served as its vice president from 1951 through 1968. In 1959, President Dwight D. Eisenhower appointed her to the first board of the National Cultural Center, now known as the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, to which she was reappointed twice by President Richard M. Nixon. As late as 1991, she was invited by the Yale School of Music to serve on its board.         Mrs. Shouse's most lasting legacy, however, is Wolf Trap. In 1966, at the age of 70, she donated 100 acres of the farm in Vienna to the United States Government to create a national park for the performing arts. There, under the auspices of the Department of the Interior, Mrs. Shouse established the Wolf Trap Foundation to manage the park, arrange programming and raise money, a unique partnership among the public and private sectors for managing an arts center. The park opened in 1971 and since then has been home to performances by some of the world's great musicians, dancers, singers and actors.         In 1982, the main amphitheater burned to the ground, but Mrs. Shouse led the drive to resurrect it, and a new theater, the 7,000-seat Filene Center (half the $18 million cost came from a Congressional appropriation), opened in 1984. It is now visited by some 500,000 people annually.         During her last decade, Mrs. Shouse, who was known to her friends as Kay, suffered from arthritis but remained a familiar figure at Wolf Trap, touring the grounds in a golf cart.         She was married twice, in 1921, to Alvin E. Dodd, a businessman from whom she was divorced in 1930. Two years later, she married Jouett Shouse, the chairman of the Democratic National Executive Committee. Shouse, a lawyer and businessman, had been a Congressman from Kansas and the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury under President Coolidge. He died in 1967.         Mrs. Shouse is survived by a daughter, Joan Dodd Tolley of Naples, four grandchildren, 10 great-grandchildren and three great-great-grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Moton Hubbard, who was deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs from 1964 to 1970, making her the top-ranking black woman in the Johnson Administration at the time, died on Sunday at her home in Chevy Chase, Md. She was 82.         Ms. Hubbard, who retired in 1970 at the onset of Cushing's disease, an adrenal disorder, died of congestive heart failure, said Marc L. Alper of Rockview, Md., a family friend.         In her State Department post, she worked at developing programs intended to eliminate discrimination against black soldiers during the Vietnam War. She also oversaw the department's public services and news offices.         During World War II, she worked for the Federal Security Agency, helping to organize arrangements for war workers and was a race and human relations consultant. She joined the State Department in 1963 as a coordinator of women's activities.         The daughter of a pioneer in the civil rights movement, Dr. Robert Russa Moton, she grew up on the campus of Tuskegee Institute, where her father had succeeded its founder, Booker T. Washington, as president. She was educated at Boston University.         Her husband, Maceo W. Hubbard, a Justice Department official, died in 1991. She is survived by two sisters, Catherine Patterson of Exeter, N.H., and Jennie Moton Taylor of Indianapolis.       
         Aminda Badeau Wilkins, a retired welfare official and the widow of Roy Wilkins, longtime executive secretary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. She was 89 and lived in Jamaica, Queens.         She suffered a brief illness, said Mildred Roxboro, director of development of the N.A.A.C.P.         Born in St. Louis, Mrs. Wilkins trained at the University of Chicago and started her career with a Chicago settlement house and doing case work in St. Louis. After her marriage to Mr. Wilkins in 1929, she moved to New York City and became a supervisor in the Department of Welfare.         She later carried out special projects for the commissioner and served as director of community relations. President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the National Advisory Council on Extension and Continuing Education, and she served on the Department of Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Armed Forces. She retired in 1971 as an assistant commissioner in the city's Department of Welfare.         Mr. Wilkins died in 1981.
