         Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in Congress and the first woman to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, died on Saturday night at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 80. She had suffered several strokes recently, according to a former staff member, William Howard.         Mrs. Chisholm was an outspoken, steely educator-turned-politician who shattered racial and gender barriers as she became a national symbol of liberal politics in the 1960's and 1970's. Over the years, she also had a way of making statements that angered the establishment, as in 1974, when she asserted that ''there is an undercurrent of resistance'' to integration ''among many blacks in areas of concentrated poverty and discrimination'' -- including in her own district in Brooklyn.         ''Just wait, there may be some fireworks,'' she declared after winning her seat in Congress in 1968 with an upset victory in Brooklyn's 12th Congressional District, which had been created by court-ordered reapportionment.         Her slogan was ''unbought and unbossed'' -- in the primary, she had defeated two other candidates, William C. Thompson, whom she maintained was the candidate of the Brooklyn Democratic organization, and Dolly Robinson. ''The party leaders do not like me,'' Mrs. Chisholm said at the time.         But about 80 percent of the registered voters in the district -- which included her own neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant -- were Democrats. That edge helped her in her race against James Farmer, a leader of the Freedom Rides in the south in the early 1960's, who ran as an independent on the Republican and Liberal lines, and Ralph Carrano, who ran as the Conservative candidate.         ''I am an historical person at this point, and I'm very much aware of it,'' she told The Washington Post a few months after she was sworn in.         Soon she was challenging the seniority system in the House, which had relegated her to its Agriculture Committee, an assignment she criticized as irrelevant to an urban district like hers.         ''Apparently all they know here in Washington about Brooklyn is that a tree grew there,'' she said in a statement at the time. ''Only nine black people have been elected to Congress, and those nine should be used as effectively as possible.''         She said that the House speaker, John W. McCormack, had told her to ''be a good soldier'' and accept the agriculture assignment. Instead, she fired a parliamentary salvo at the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur D. Mills, who handed out the committee assignments. Before long, she was reassigned, first to the Veterans Affairs Committee, and eventually to the Education and Labor Committees.         Winning a better committee assignment did not make her any less acerbic on the workings of Washington. ''Our representative democracy is not working,'' she wrote in a 1970 book that borrowed her campaign slogan as its title, ''because the Congress that is supposed to represent the voters does not respond to their needs. I believe the chief reason for this is that it is ruled by a small group of old men.''         In 1972, when she entered the presidential primaries, she did not expect to capture the Democratic nomination, which ultimately went to George S. McGovern. ''Some see my candidacy as an alternate and others as symbolic or a move to make other candidates start addressing themselves to real issues,'' she said at the time. She did not win a single primary, but in 2002, she said her campaign had been a necessary ''catalyst for change.''         She was also aware of her status as a woman in politics. ''I've always met more discrimination being a woman than being black,'' she told The Associated Press in December 1982, shortly before she left Washington to teach at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. ''When I ran for the Congress, when I ran for president, I met more discrimination as a woman than for being black. Men are men.''         Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Nov. 30, 1924. Her father worked in a factory that made burlap bags, and her mother was a seamstress and domestic worker. They sent their daughter and her three sisters to Barbados, where the children lived with a grandmother until 1934. Mrs. Chisholm later described the relatives she encountered there as ''a strongly disciplined family unit.''         But she had her own strength, too: ''Mother always said that even when I was 3, I used to get the 6- and 7-year-old kids on the block and punch them and say, 'Listen to me.'''         Her professors listened to her at Brooklyn College, where she won prizes in debating. Some of them told her she should think about politics as a career.         First, though, she taught in a nursery school and earned a master's degree in elementary education at Columbia University. Working as the director of the Friends Day Nursery in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and the Hamilton-Madison Child Care Center in Lower Manhattan, she became widely known as an authority on early education and child welfare. She argued that early schooling was essential, saying she knew there were experts who maintained that children's eyes were not developed enough for reading. ''I say baloney, because I learned to read when I was 3 1/2,'' she countered, ''and I learned to write when I was 4.''         From 1959 to 1964, she was an educational consultant in the day care division of the city's bureau of child welfare. But she laid a foundation for her eventual political career, working as a clubhouse volunteer and with organizations like the Bedford-Stuyvesant Political League and the League of Women Voters.         So, when she decided to run for the New York State Assembly in 1964, she said the decision was straightforward: ''The people wanted me.''         She moved on to the House four years later, in the year when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run for re-election. A year later, she confirmed her reputation for independence when she endorsed John V. Lindsay, who was running for re-election as mayor of New York         as the Liberal Party candidate.By 1982, the political climate had changed, and Mrs. Chisholm left Washington after seven terms in the House, saying that ''moderate and liberal'' lawmakers were ''running for cover from the new right.'' But she also had personal reasons for deciding not to seek re-election that year: Her second husband, Arthur Hardwick, a Buffalo liquor store owner who had been in the New York State Assembly when Mrs. Chisholm was, had been injured in a car accident. (Her first marriage, to Conrad O. Chisholm, ended in divorce in 1977. Mr. Hardwick died in 1986.)         ''I had been so consumed by my life in politics,'' she said in 1982. ''I had no time for privacy, no time for my husband, no time to play my beautiful grand piano. After he recovered, I decided to make some changes in my life. I truly believe God had a message for me.''         She also sounded frustrated, saying she had been misunderstood for much of her career. She mentioned her hospital visit to George C. Wallace, the Alabama governor who built his political career on segregation, after he had been wounded in an assassination attempt in 1972.         ''Black people in my community crucified me,'' she recalled. ''But why shouldn't I go to visit him? Every other presidential candidate was going to see him. He said to me, 'What are your people going to say?' I said: 'I know what they're going to say. But I wouldn't want what happened to you to happen to anyone.' He cried and cried and cried.''         She maintained that her visit had paid off. ''He always spoke well of Shirley Chisholm in the South,'' she said, adding that she had contacted him in 1974, when she was looking for votes for a bill to extend federal minimum-wage provisions to domestic workers. ''Many of the Southerners did not want to make the vote. They came around.''         Mrs. Chisholm moved to Florida in 1991 and said in 2002, ''I live a very quiet life.'' She said she spent her time reading biographies -- political biographies.         ''I have faded out of the scene,'' she said.         When she left Washington, she said she did not want to go down in history as ''the nation's first black congresswoman'' or, as she put it, ''the first black woman congressman.''         ''I'd like them to say that Shirley Chisholm had guts,'' she said. ''That's how I'd like to be remembered.''       
         Lucy Freeman, a reporter and an author whose early coverage of psychiatry and mental health for The New York Times led to wider reporting on the subject, died on Wednesday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, in the Bronx. She was 88.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her nephew David L. Schroedel.         Ms. Freeman, one of the few women on the Times's reporting staff when she was hired in 1940, initially wrote light society features, but moved to breaking news with an award-winning story on the explosion of two ships hauling munitions in Galveston Bay, Tex., in 1947.         By the late 1940's, some time after she began undergoing her own psychoanalysis, she persuaded editors to allow coverage of the growth of psychiatry and the preservation of Sigmund Freud's private papers.         ''It was even more unusual because it was in an era in which psychology was not popular,'' said Nan Robertson, the author of ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times.'' ''It used to be that people poked fun at getting shrunk.''         Over the course of four years, she reported on welfare, the stigma of mental illness and advancements in treatments for schizophrenic patients. She also studied mental health and welfare programs in the city hospital system.         Her nonfiction books, ranging from detailed studies of Freud to those exploring sources of anger and anxiety, helped familiarize a popular audience with what had long been a hush-hush practice.         Ms. Freeman's first book, ''Fight Against Fears,'' recounted her own experience as a psychoanalysis patient who struggled to overcome her shy, whispery voice and social fears. Published in 1951, the book was in print for 47 years.         Ms. Freeman also wrote 77 other books, including mystery novels and memoirs.         The first of four children born to a prominent New York family, Ms. Freeman was a member of the first graduating class at Bennington College in Vermont.         She was hired by The New York Times in 1940 and would later describe the newsroom of the day as ''a sea of male reporters.''         ''I hardly dared savor the glory. All those men,'' she wrote in a memoir, ''The Beloved Prison,'' (St. Martin's Press, 1989). ''I also dared the fleeting thought that among all these masculine forms perhaps I would find a husband.''         She eventually married William M. Freeman, an editor who had fixed an error in a story she filed from Texas. The marriage lasted two years.         Fond of low-cut dresses and high-heeled shoes, Ms. Freeman relished the attention she received from her male colleagues on the city desk, Ms. Robertson said. Mary Yost, Ms. Freeman's agent for more than 15 years, said that she digested academic papers like a scholar, but always preferred to write for a larger audience.         She could at times ''appear to be an ingénue, an innocent,'' Ms. Yost said, but she also played a mean game of poker, loved throwing large parties at her apartment with a view of Central Park, and mixed as easily with jockeys as she did with actors and intellectuals.         ''She enjoyed a popular audience for her work, and she wanted it in her social life, too,'' Ms. Yost said.         Ms. Freeman is survived by her brother, Edward Greenbaum of Clearwater, Fla; her sister, Sue Polera of Las Vegas; her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Warren Rosenberg of Scarborough, N.Y.; and numerous nieces and nephews.       
         Suzie Frankfurt, an interior decorator who popularized 18th- and 19th-century Russian furniture among corporate raiders of the 1970's and 1980's and was an early collaborator of Andy Warhol, died on Jan. 7 at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, in the Bronx. She was 73.         She had lived in Norfolk, Conn., until she became incapacitated several years ago after treatment of a brain tumor, her family said.         A bohemian hostess, the flame-haired Ms. Frankfurt was known as a creative catalyst as well as a celebrity decorator. The designer Gianni Versace, for example, credited her with introducing him to America when he was largely unknown, not to mention also introducing him to Studio 54.         The guest lists of her idiosyncratic cocktail parties included such unlikely pairings as Bill Blass and the jazz-rock group Blood, Sweat & Tears.         Ms. Frankfurt was born Suzanne Allen on Aug. 21, 1931, in Los Angeles, the daughter of Eva and Isidore Allen, the owner of a linen distribution company. A cousin was married to a son of the industrialist Norton Simon, and through that association she became part of a well-connected extended family that included the actress Jennifer Jones, who was married to Simon, and Simon's sister, Marcia Weisman, a prominent art collector.         After graduating with honors from Stanford, Ms. Allen moved to New York to work in the research department of the Young & Rubicam advertising agency, whose accounts included Norton Simon's food conglomerate. In 1956, she married Stephen O. Frankfurt, a graphic designer who was one of the agency's art directors; he later designed the titles for the film ''To Kill a Mockingbird'' and eventually became the president of Young & Rubicam. The couple divorced in 1968.         She is survived by her sons, Jaime and Peter, both of Los Angeles, and four grandchildren.         Research proved not to be Ms. Frankfurt's forte. Instead, she was given the responsibility of redecorating Young & Rubicam's lobby and executive conference rooms. Thirty years later, she had become one of the world's most admired interior decorators with a varied list of clients, including Robert Redford, Robert Mapplethorpe and a Florida bank chairman later convicted of fraud named David L. Paul. He was accused of paying Ms. Frankfurt some $389,000 in bank funds to decorate his home.         Connoisseur magazine called her a ''nostalgic romantic,'' explaining that her taste reflected an admiration for ''the ancient regime -- any regime, and the madder the king, the better.''         Ms. Frankfurt lived as well as she decorated, in a succession of town houses on the Upper East Side, all packed with Biedermeier and Russian antiques. ''I made Russian chic,'' she said in an interview with W magazine in 1993. ''Now, it's too chic.''         Though articles about Ms. Frankfurt's interior designs appeared frequently in Architectural Digest, The New York Times and other publications, she also occupied a small but significant niche in American art history, thanks to her friendship with Mr. Warhol.         She and Mr. Warhol met in 1959, and the friendship lasted a lifetime. In fact, the index of Mr. Warhol's published diaries has 34 entries for Ms. Frankfurt.         The first encounter occurred at Serendipity, an Upper East Side ice cream parlor, after she saw an exhibition of his watercolors. Their rapport was instantaneous, though tinged with opportunism. ''The only reason Andy liked me was because I was raised in Malibu with movie stars like Myrna Loy all around,'' Ms. Frankfurt said in an interview in The New York Observer years later. ''I liked Andy because I'd always felt my whole life that I was an outsider.''         Within the year, Ms. Frankfurt and Mr. Warhol produced ''Wild Raspberries,'' a spoof of haute cuisine cookbooks; the title was a tongue-in-cheek allusion to ''Wild Strawberries,'' the Ingmar Bergman film. Warhol illustrated the slender volume, which was colored by schoolchildren. The calligraphy text was the work of the artist's mother, Julia Warhola. Ms. Frankfurt prepared the recipes, which sounded like a cross between Julia Child and Edward Gorey, and included Omelette Greta Garbo (''always to be eaten alone in a candlelit room''). ,         ''Wild Raspberries'' failed to find an audience outside its creators' friends and families. It was probably just as well: only a few dozen copies were printed, each hand-bound by rabbis on the Lower East Side. In 1997, however, the book was reprinted by Bulfinch Press and received admiring reviews as an oddity.         Ms. Frankfurt herself called it ''a little dippy.''         Correction:  January 18, 2005, Tuesday  Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Suzie Frankfurt, a New York decorator who was a friend and collaborator of Andy Warhol's, misstated the place of her first meeting with him. It was at the Plaza Hotel after she had seen an exhibition of his watercolors at the restaurant Serendipity; they did not meet at Serendipity.       
         Ruth Warrick, who made her movie debut with Orson Welles in ''Citizen Kane'' and ended her career with the long-running role of Phoebe Tyler Wallingford on the television soap opera ''All My Children,'' died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         The cause was complications of pneumonia, said her manager, Carolyn Anthony.         Ms. Warrick was not well known when she took the role of Emily Monroe Norton, the president's niece who marries the newspaper magnate Charles Foster Kane, in Welles's 1941 film classic. Three decades later, her role as Phoebe, the patrician matriarch of the Tyler family on ABC's ''All My Children,'' fixed her most indelibly in the American consciousness. She created the role when the show was first broadcast in 1970, and this month she made a final visit to its fictional setting, Pine Valley, to commemorate the soap opera's 35th anniversary.         A striking woman with auburn hair, Ms. Warrick was born on June 29, 1916, in St. Joseph, Mo. In 1937, she won a contest to serve as Kansas City's paid ambassador and ended up making a many-feathered entrance in New York when she presented a live turkey to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia on the steps of City Hall. As Ms. Warrick recalled, the mayor was not impressed by the gift, but she managed to hang on in New York and began to work in radio.         In 1940, when Welles was searching for talent for his epic ''Citizen Kane,'' he was referred to Ms. Warrick. He was impressed enough to cast her as the wife of his own character. In their most famous scene together, the Kanes' marriage disintegrates over the breakfast table, and she is finally seen reading his competitor's newspaper. Ms. Warrick was subsequently signed to a contract with RKO.         She went on to appear in about 30 films, including ''Obliging Young Lady,'' ''The Corsican Brothers'' and ''Journey Into Fear,'' in which she again appeared with Welles. In theater, she worked extensively in summer stock and on Broadway, which she called her first love. She appeared with Debbie Reynolds in the 1973 musical ''Irene'' and starred with Jackie Gleason in the 1959 ''Take Me Along.'' But even with those substantial screen and stage credits, Ms. Warrick was grateful for her role as Phoebe, the haughty grande dame of Pine Valley.         ''We have become the phenomenon of our time, the best game in town,'' she told The New York Times in 1985. ''In one week, we play to an audience larger than Clark Gable played to in his whole career. You say 'Phoebe,' and 50 million people know what you mean.''         Susan Lucci, another original cast member of ''All My Children,'' who has played Erica Kane for more than three decades, said Ms. Warrick had little in common with the judgmental, status-driven Phoebe.         ''I always counted myself lucky, especially at the beginning, to be in the presence of such a legendary, glamorous actress,'' Ms. Lucci said in a telephone interview. ''She would tell these wonderful stories about Orson Welles and the studios she worked at.''         Ms. Lucci said Ms. Warrick had a playful side. In the 1970's, when streaking -- running naked through a public place -- was all the rage, she dashed through the set wearing nothing more than a fur coat, which she briefly opened for a laugh.         Ms. Lucci said Ms. Warrick would frequently finish a day's work, fly to a charity event and then be back on the set the next day.         Ms. Warrick was active in several charities, including the League School in Walpole, Mass., for autistic children. She taught in Operation Bootstrap, a Los Angeles program that provided teachers to poor neighborhoods, and at Julia Richman High School in Manhattan as part of President Jimmy Carter's Cities in Schools program.         Ms. Warrick, who married five times, is survived by three children, Karen Langenwalter, Jon Rolf and Robert McNamara; a grandson; and six great-grandchildren. In addition to ''All My Children,'' she worked for five years on ''As the World Turns'' and played Hannah Cord in the 1960's prime-time soap opera ''Peyton Place,'' as well as in the 1985 made-for-television movie ''Peyton Place: The Next Generation.''         But it was her role on ''A.M.C.,'' as her fans love to call it, that she treasured. As she said in 1985: ''You grab hold of one of those jobs, you don't want to let go.''       
         Miriam Rothschild, the heiress who discovered how fleas jump, brought Chaucerian wildflowers back to modern England and was acknowledged as one of the world's most distinguished naturalists, died Thursday at her home, Ashton Wold, in Northamptonshire. She was 96.         Her death was announced by her family.         Her extensive scientific and conservation achievements were matched by the might of her will and her delectably eccentric personality.         ''Imagine Beatrix Potter on amphetamines,'' The Times of London once said of her.         Though she viewed herself as a naturalist, more of a describer than an experimenter, she was taken seriously as a scientist and often worked with distinguished colleagues. Her well-known work on butterflies making themselves toxic by means of their food choices was done with the chemist Tadeus Reichstein, a Nobel Prize winner. Her highly original observations helped confirm 19th-century theories of evolution that had awaited 20th-century chemistry.         Given the title of dame by the queen in 1999 for her scientific achievements, she was more than a scientist, not least because she never had to fill out a grant application.         Was it odd that a scion of the venerable Rothschild clan should become the world's leading expert on fleas? Hardly. Dame Miriam's father was the banker Nathaniel Charles Rothschild, who found more than 500 new species of fleas. His daughter's six-volume catalog of his collection of 30,000 specimens, which she completed in 20 years beginning in 1953, firmly established her as the flea authority other experts consulted.         Her uncle Lionel Walter Rothschild's collections were just as inspirational. He amassed 2.3 million butterflies, 300,000 bird skins, 144 giant tortoises and 300,000 birds' eggs, among other things..         From her earliest youth, Dame Miriam loved animals and plants. Her mind was free to roam, and she received no formal education until she was 17, when she demanded to go to school. She never earned any degree, but received an honorary doctorate from Oxford in 1968.         Ranging from marine biology to chemistry to pharmacology to neurophysiology to horticulture to zoology, she came up with novel, often startling conclusions.         Her research on insects eating substances that are poisonous to their predators was considered groundbreaking. After determining that butterflies' bright colors were warning signals of their toxicity, she found that other species evolved to mimic the danger-sign coloration. She found that odors emitted by toxic butterflies were mimicked by other species, vindicating 19th-century naturalists' speculations.         Her enthusiasm for wildflowers led to her advising Prince Charles on plantings for his estate and Lady Bird Johnson on her program to beautify American roadsides.         Her interests ranged far beyond science. During World War II she tenaciously pressed the British authorities to admit more Jews from Nazi Germany and at one point personally housed 49 Jewish children. She worked in the top-secret British effort at Bletchley Park to crack the Nazis' code.         She fought for cause upon cause, including better treatment for laboratory animals, rights for homosexuals and free milk for schoolchildren.         Her farm at the family estate of Ashton Wold, near Peterborough, was a passion and her main source of income. Her livestock and plants won awards.         She did it all with a zestfully personal sense of style, wearing the loose-fitting clothes she designed for herself 50 years ago as she walked the grounds with her half-dozen pet Shetland sheepdogs.         Miriam Louisa Rothschild was born on Aug. 5, 1908, at Ashton Wold, where she lived her entire life. Her mother, Rozika de Wertheimstein, was a top Hungarian sportswoman, and Dame Miriam herself played tennis, cricket and squash, the last in international competitions.         Her childhood, as described in a 1987 New Yorker profile by Kennedy Fraser, was ''like a fairy tale: the palatial houses stuffed with mysteries and treasures; the grandfather who liked to shower gold half-sovereigns from his carriage; the brilliant dotty uncle with his cassowaries and his white top hat.''         Her first love was nature. By the age of 4 she was collecting ladybugs and caterpillars and taking a tame quail to bed with her.         Her world darkened when she was 15 and her father committed suicide. She temporarily lost interest in his passion, the natural world. But a year or two later, her enthusiasm was rekindled when she helped her brother dissect a frog.         ''I had never before seen fresh, internal organs, blood vessels and nerves,'' she wrote in an essay in Scientific American. Calling the experience ''my road to Damascus,'' she wrote, ''Their extreme beauty was a revelation.''         After taking some courses at the University of London, she worked in Naples and England studying a kind of mollusk.         ''During the first day of dissecting the bivalve,'' she wrote in Scientific American, ''I found a specimen infested with larval trematodes,'' which are parasitic flatworms known as flukes. ''It proved to be a hitherto undescribed species and a most extraordinary one from every point of view. My fate was sealed. I was completely hooked.''         She worked 16-hour days studying trematodes until a German bomb destroyed all traces of seven years of her research.         With the war, she passed a test to be an air warden but was first assigned to work as a dairymaid. She was secretly summoned to work on the top-secret Enigma code-breaking project and labored 12 hours a day for several years with Alan Turing.         In 1943 she married George Lane, a handsome Hungarian-born British commando. They had four children and adopted two more before divorcing in 1957. She is survived by one of her sons and three of her daughters.         As she raised her children, her late-night attention turned to fleas. She began writing about them in clear, engaging prose.         In ''Fleas, Flukes & Cuckoos: A Study of Bird Parasites,'' which she wrote with Theresa Clay in 1952 (Philosophical Library), she argued that most people misunderstood fleas.         ''It is difficult for them to realize that fleas breathe through holes in their sides, have a nerve cord below their stomachs and a heart in their backs; or that certain arthropods lay eggs through their heads and regularly practice virgin birth.''         Using high-speed photography, she studied how fleas jump. She theorized that they descended from winged ancestors and employed modified flight structures. In a famous comparison, she said fleas jump as high for fleas as the Empire State Building would be for humans.         Turning to plants as well as animals, she became one of the first practitioners of the new interdisciplinary approach to biological studies called ecology.         She began designing gardens to attract butterflies, writing extensively on the subject.         ''You can really abandon any romantic idea of creating a home for these angelic creatures,'' she wrote in ''The Butterfly Gardener,'' published in 1983. ''The best you can do is provide them with a good pub.'' She owned a pub for humans, in Ashton, decorated with natural history exhibits.         In 1970 she began to collect, propagate and sell wildflower seeds.         ''In the early 1980's, I went to a lecture given by a distinguished zoologist who said we should preserve our medieval hayfields, because it would take a thousand years to grow one from scratch,'' she said. ''After the lecture I told him I had done a good imitation in 10. From that moment, I thought I should spread the gospel.''         Spread it she did, to Mrs. Johnson and Prince Charles. As a result of the movement she led, British agriculture policies that favored replacing natural meadows with rye grass were reversed.         She remained as down to earth as the stone ruin her own house became as she deliberately let an immense tangle of ivy, wisteria, clematis and roses envelop it.       
         Anne Cox, a New York socialite who designed high fashion for high society in the 1950's and became the mother-in-law of a president's daughter, died on Tuesday in Westhampton Beach, N.Y. She was 86 and a resident of Palm Beach, Fla.         The cause was Lewy body disease, a form of dementia similar to Alzheimer's, her son Howard said.         Mrs. Cox offered her own designs in a boutique on 57th Street in Manhattan. She was also an occasional fashion and society columnist for The Herald Tribune and a fashion adviser for Bergdorf Goodman. Later she worked as a real estate developer in the Hamptons.         Mrs. Cox was descended on her mother's side from the socially prominent Livingston family. She was a patron of charities, including the Association for the Relief of Respectable, Aged, Indigent Females, of which she was president, and she was long the chairwoman or a co-chairwoman of the annual International Debutante Ball.         Anne Delafield Finch Cox was born in Westhampton Beach on March 13, 1918, and graduated from the Chapin School, where she was later a trustee and president of the alumnae association.         Her husband, Howard Ellis Cox, a New York lawyer, died in 1989. In addition to her son Howard Ellis Jr. of Boston, she is survived by a daughter, Mazie Livingston Delafield Cox of Northampton, Mass.; another son, Edward, who is married to Tricia Nixon, of Manhattan; a brother, Edward Ridley Finch Jr. of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.       
         Consuelo Velázquez, the songwriter who in 1941 created ''Bésame Mucho,'' a Latin hit that took on a life of its own worldwide, died on Jan. 22 in Mexico City. She was believed to have been 88.         The cause was respiratory problems, her family told The Associated Press.         ''Bésame Mucho'' is not so much an enduring standard as a global phenomenon. Translated into dozens of languages and performed by hundreds of artists, the song has been an emblem of Latin identity, an anthem of lovers separated by World War II and perennial grist for lounge singers everywhere.         Recorded by artists both serious (the Beatles) and saccharine (Mantovani), ''Bésame Mucho'' has had more than two million performances on radio and television, according to BMI, the music publishing organization.         The English version, written by Sunny Skylar in 1944, was a hit that year for the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra, with vocals by Kitty Kallen and Bob Eberly.         Ms. Velázquez was born in Ciudad Guzmán, Mexico, in 1916. (She sometimes gave the date as 1920.) Trained as a concert pianist, she wrote the original Spanish lyrics for ''Bésame Mucho'' when she was 25 and, as she liked to say, had never been kissed.         The song's haunting melody, which Ms. Velázquez also wrote, is based on the aria ''Quejas, o la Maja y el Ruiseñor'' (''Plaints, or the Maiden and the Nightingale''), from the 1916 opera ''Goyescas,'' by the Spanish composer Enrique Granados.         Ms. Velázquez's lyrics have a simple dramatic urgency: Bésame, bésame mucho,/Como si fuera esta noche la última vez (''Kiss me, kiss me a lot,/as if tonight were the last time'').         The English lyrics (Bésame, bésame mucho,/Each time I cling to your kiss, I hear music divine) add a generous dollop of schmaltz.         Among the strange bedfellows who have recorded the song are: Danny Aiello, Josephine Baker, Dave Brubeck, Vikki Carr, José Carreras, Charo, the Coasters, Nat King Cole, Xavier Cugat, Plácido Domingo, Bill Evans, the Flamingos, Connie Francis, Dexter Gordon, Chris Isaak, Harry James, Spike Jones, Diana Krall, Frankie Laine, Steve Lawrence and Eydie Gorme, Julie London, Trini Lopez, Dean Martin, Carmen McRae, Nana Mouskouri, Les Paul, Art Pepper, the Platters, Tito Puente, Artie Shaw and the 101 Strings Orchestra.         Ms. Velázquez's other songs, none of which rivaled the success of ''Bésame Mucho,'' include ''Amar y Vivir'' (''To Love and to Live'') and ''Verdad Amarga'' (''Bitter Truth'').       
         Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in Congress and the first woman to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, died on Saturday night at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 80.         She died after several recent strokes, according to a former staff member, William Howard.         Mrs. Chisholm was an outspoken, steely educator-turned-politician who shattered racial and gender barriers as she became a national symbol of liberal politics in the 1960's and 1970's. Over the years, she also had a way of making statements that angered the establishment, as in 1974, when she asserted that ''there is an undercurrent of resistance'' to integration ''among many blacks in areas of concentrated poverty and discrimination,'' including in her own district in Brooklyn.         ''Just wait, there may be some fireworks,'' she declared after winning her seat in Congress in 1968 with an upset victory in Brooklyn's 12th Congressional District, which had been created by court-ordered reapportionment. Her slogan was ''unbought and unbossed'' -- in the primary, she had defeated two other candidates, William C. Thompson, who she maintained was the candidate of the Brooklyn Democratic organization, and Dolly Robinson. ''The party leaders do not like me,'' Mrs. Chisholm said at the time.         But about 80 percent of the registered voters in the district, which included her own neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant, were Democrats. That edge helped her in her race against James Farmer, a leader of the freedom rides in the south in the early 1960's, who ran as an independent on the Republican and Liberal lines, and Ralph Carrano, who ran as the Conservative candidate.         ''I am an historical person at this point, and I'm very much aware of it,'' she told The Washington Post a few months after she was sworn in.         Soon she was challenging the seniority system in the House, which had relegated her to its Agriculture Committee, an assignment she criticized as irrelevant to an urban district like hers.         ''Apparently all they know here in Washington about Brooklyn is that a tree grew there,'' she said in a statement at the time. ''Only nine black people have been elected to Congress, and those nine should be used as effectively as possible.''         She said that the House speaker, John W. McCormack, had told her to ''be a good soldier'' and accept the agriculture assignment. Instead, she fired a parliamentary salvo at the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur D. Mills, who gave out committee assignments. Before long, she was reassigned, first to the Veterans Affairs Committee and later to the Education and Labor Committees.         Winning a better committee assignment did not make her any less acerbic on the workings of Washington. ''Our representative democracy is not working,'' she wrote in a 1970 book that borrowed her campaign slogan as its title, ''because the Congress that is supposed to represent the voters does not respond to their needs. I believe the chief reason for this is that it is ruled by a small group of old men.''         In 1972, when she entered the presidential primaries, she did not expect to capture the Democratic nomination, which ultimately went to George S. McGovern. ''Some see my candidacy as an alternate and others as symbolic or a move to make other candidates start addressing themselves to real issues,'' she said at the time. She did not win a single primary, but in 2002, she said her campaign had been a necessary ''catalyst for change.''         She was also aware of her status as a woman in politics. ''When I ran for the Congress, when I ran for president, I met more discrimination as a woman than for being black,'' she told The Associated Press in December 1982, shortly before she left Washington to teach at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. ''Men are men.''         Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Nov. 30, 1924. Her father worked in a factory that made burlap bags, and her mother was a seamstress and domestic worker. They sent their daughter and her three sisters to Barbados, where the children lived with a grandmother until 1934. Mrs. Chisholm later described the relatives she encountered there as ''a strongly disciplined family unit.''         But she had her own strength, too: ''Mother always said that even when I was 3, I used to get the 6- and 7-year-old kids on the block and punch them and say, 'Listen to me.'''         Her professors listened to her at Brooklyn College, where she won prizes in debating. Some told her she should think about a political career.         First, though, she taught in a nursery school and earned a master's degree in elementary education at Columbia University. Working as the director of the Friends Day Nursery in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and the Hamilton-Madison House Child Care Center in Lower Manhattan, she became known as an authority on early education and child welfare.         When she decided to run for the New York State Assembly in 1964, she said the decision was straightforward: ''The people wanted me.''         She moved on to the House four years later, in the year when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run for re-election. A year later, she confirmed her reputation for independence when she endorsed John V. Lindsay, who was running for re-election as mayor of New York as the Liberal Party candidate.         By 1982, the political climate had changed, and Mrs. Chisholm left Washington after seven terms in the House, saying that ''moderate and liberal'' lawmakers were ''running for cover from the new right.'' But she also had personal reasons for deciding not to seek re-election that year: Her second husband, Arthur Hardwick, a Buffalo liquor store owner who had been in the New York State Assembly when Mrs. Chisholm was, had been injured in a car accident. (Her first marriage, to Conrad O. Chisholm, ended in divorce in 1977. Mr. Hardwick died in 1986.)         ''I had been so consumed by my life in politics,'' she said in 1982. ''I had no time for privacy, no time for my husband, no time to play my beautiful grand piano. After he recovered, I decided to make some changes in my life. I truly believe God had a message for me.''         She also sounded frustrated, saying she had been misunderstood for much of her career. She mentioned her hospital visit to George C. Wallace, the Alabama governor who built his political career on segregation, after he had been wounded in an assassination attempt in 1972.         ''Black people in my community crucified me,'' she recalled. ''But why shouldn't I go to visit him? Every other presidential candidate was going to see him. He said to me, 'What are your people going to say?' I said: 'I know what they're going to say. But I wouldn't want what happened to you to happen to anyone.' He cried and cried and cried.''         She maintained that her visit had paid off. ''He always spoke well of Shirley Chisholm in the South,'' she said, adding that she had contacted him in 1974, when she was looking for votes for a bill to extend federal minimum-wage provisions to domestic workers. ''Many of the Southerners did not want to make the vote. They came around.''         Mrs. Chisholm moved to Florida in 1991 and said in 2002, ''I live a very quiet life.'' She said she spent her time reading biographies -- political biographies. ''I have faded out of the scene,'' she said.         When she left Washington, she said she did not want to go down in history as ''the nation's first black congresswoman'' or, as she put it, ''the first black woman congressman.''         ''I'd like them to say that Shirley Chisholm had guts,'' she said. ''That's how I'd like to be remembered.''       
         Chesbrough Lewis Patcevitch, a former New York social figure and fund-raiser for charitable causes, died on Dec. 28 in Miami. She was 92 and she lived in West Palm Beach, Fla.         Her death was announced by her family.         Mrs. Patcevitch, who married four times, was the widow of Iva S.V. Patcevitch, a former president and chairman of Condé Nast Publications. He died in 1993 after 30 years of marriage. She was the mother of Chessy Rayner, a decorator and fashion writer and editor who died in 1998.         A native of Perrysburg, Ohio, the young Chesbrough Lewis was a cafe society beauty photographed by Horst and Avedon. She formerly lived in Southampton, N.Y., and on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         She was active most notably for Southampton Hospital and Just One Break Inc., known as JOB.         Mrs. Patcevitch is survived by a son, Charles Minot Amory III of Palm Beach, and three grandsons.       
         Elizabeth Janeway, who began her career as a best-selling novelist in the 1940's and later distinguished herself as a critic, a lecturer and an early advocate of the women's movement, died yesterday at a retirement home in Rye, N.Y. She was 91.         Her death was reported by her son Michael Janeway, a writer and editor who is a professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.         Most of Ms. Janeway's earlier books were novels that focused on family situations and occasionally the pressures on women of modern society and were cited for their psychological acuteness and good sense. All the while, she reviewed books for The New York Times and other newspapers, and was credited for helping to introduce English writers like Anthony Powell to an American audience and for defending the artistic merits of ''Lolita,'' by Nabokov.         In the 1970's, she began to write nonfiction books about feminist issues: ''Man's World, Woman's Place: A Study of Social Mythology'' (Morrow, 1971), ''Between Myth and Morning: Women Awakening'' (Morrow, 1974), ''Powers of the Weak'' (Knopf, 1980) and ''Improper Behavior'' (Morrow, 1987), among others.         Despite her conventional-seeming role as a wife and mother, she was always staunch in her support of feminism, remaining friends with women like Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem and Kate Millett, her son said. Reviewing ''Between Myth and Morning'' in The Christian Science Monitor, June Goodwin wrote: ''Of all the writers on the subject of feminism,'' Ms. Janeway ''has the most acceptability in the eyes of men. She has credentials, she is married to a successful man'' -- the economist and writer Eliot Janeway -- ''has children; as recently as 1969 she termed the women's movement 'frivolous and gestural.'''         Ms. Goodwin concluded that women ''need to read books'' like this ''to have their thoughts and experience confirmed and thus to be reinforced for action.''         Elizabeth Hall Janeway was born Oct. 7, 1913, in Brooklyn, the granddaughter of an Episcopal minister and the younger daughter of Charles H. Hall, a naval architect, and Jeanette F. Searle Hall.         After graduating from the Shore Road Academy in Brooklyn, she spent a year, 1930-31, at Swarthmore College. Her son said that because the Depression wiped out her family's savings, she broke off her education to spend a year writing advertising copy for a department store, Abraham & Straus, and handling orders for the Book of the Month Club.         She then went to Barnard College, taking her B.A. degree in 1935.         In 1938, she married Mr. Janeway, who died in 1993. Their second son, William Hall Janeway, a financial executive, also survives her.         In 1943, she published her first novel, ''The Walsh Girls'' (Doubleday), about two New England sisters, one of whom rejoins the other after her German husband's death in a concentration camp. The book was praised by John Dos Passos, and it became a best seller. Six more novels followed, among them ''Daisy Kenyon'' (Doubleday, 1945), which was made into a movie starring Joan Crawford; ''Leaving Home'' (Doubleday, 1953; reissued by CUNY, 1987); and ''Accident'' (Harper & Row, 1964), as well as several books for young people and collections on writing that she edited.         Ms. Janeway was also active on behalf of writers, serving as president of the Authors Guild from 1965 to 1969, a longtime member of the executive board of the American Center of Poets, Essayists and Novelists, a member of the board of directors of the McDowell Colony, and a judge for both the National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prizes.         She was a trustee of Barnard, a fellow of Berkeley College at Yale University and a director of the Legal and Education Fund for the National Organization for Women.         Through her husband's involvement with the Roosevelt and Johnson administrations, she came to know many prominent Washington figures, including Eleanor Roosevelt, about whom she wrote profiles. At the request of Walter Reuther, the labor organizer, Ms. Janeway served as secretary of the National Committee to Aid Families of G.M. Strikers during an auto workers strike against General Motors soon after World War II.       
         The Spanish soprano Victoria de los Angeles, whose sweet-toned lyric voice and beguiling expressivity earned her a devoted following during a career of more than four decades, died overnight Friday in a hospital in Barcelona, a spokesman for the Liceu Opera there said. Ms. de los Angeles, who was 81, had been admitted to the city's Teknon clinic with cardiorespiratory problems on New Year's Eve.         For sheer loveliness of timbre, affecting sensitivity, elegance of line and utter ease in florid passagework, she was hard to top. By the 1950's she was a mainstay of opera houses around the world and widely admired for her portrayals of leading lyric soprano roles, including Puccini's Mimi (from ''La Bohème'') and Madama Butterfly, Verdi's Violetta (from ''La Traviata''), and Massenet's Manon, Bizet's Carmen and Debussy's Mélisande.         Though her sound was not enormous, she knew how to project her voice so that it carried effortlessly in the opera house. She even sang lighter Wagner roles with effectiveness and allure, including Elisabeth in ''Tannhäuser,'' the role of her 1961 Bayreuth Festival debut in Germany, and Eva in ''Die Meistersinger.''         To some tastes Ms. de los Angeles lacked temperament. By her own admission she was not an intellectually probing artist. But at her best she was an exquisite, unmannered and deeply communicative singer. On stage, with her black hair, gleaming eyes and broad smile, she projected an openness and naïveté that, coupled with her creamy voice, audiences adored.         From the start of her career, Ms. de los Angeles was a devoted recitalist who sang an extensive repertory of German, French and Spanish songs. Her American recital debut program at Carnegie Hall in October of 1950 included such rarities at the time as a recitative and aria from Monteverdi's ''Orfeo.'' At the end of the recital she endeared herself to an already smitten audience by sitting on the closed lid of the piano and singing a group of Spanish songs accompanying herself on the guitar. In his review of that recital, Virgil Thomson, the demanding critic of The New York Herald Tribune, wrote, ''The voice is one of rare natural beauty, the schooling impeccable, the artistry first class.''         Victoria Gómez Cima was born in Barcelona on Nov. 1, 1923, to a musical family. She studied piano, voice and guitar at home, then continued her training at the conservatory in Barcelona, completing the six-year program in three years and graduating at 18 with the highest honors. That same year at a coffee house near the university she met Enrique Magriña, a law student. After a traditional long Spanish courtship they were married in 1948.         After the conservatory, instead of immediately pursing a career in opera, Ms. de los Angeles joined Ars Musicae, an ensemble that specialized in French and Spanish songs from the Renaissance to modern times and in German lieder. She made her recital debut in 1944 in Barcelona and, several months later, her professional debut in opera as the Countess in Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' at the Liceu. After winning the Geneva International Singing Competition in 1947, she attracted the attention of the world's leading opera companies, and debuts at Covent Garden in London, La Scala in Milan and elsewhere soon followed.         Her Met debut in 1951 was as Marguerite in Gounod's ''Faust.'' For almost a decade she was a favorite at the Met. Among her highlights at the house was a 1958 performance as Desdemona in Verdi's ''Otello'' with Mario Del Monaco in the title role and Leonard Warren as Iago, a performance that the Met has released as a special edition of a live historic broadcast.         In 1948 she began an association with EMI that lasted nearly 30 years and produced over 80 recordings including 21 complete operas. Among these are several classics, including a 1956 ''La Bohème'' with Ms. de los Angeles as Mimi and Jussi Björling as Rodolfo and Sir Thomas Beecham conducting.         Speaking in a 1977 interview with The New York Times about Carmen, a mezzo-soprano role that Ms. de los Angeles sang with assurance and distinction, she complained that many interpreters simply do not understand Spanish women. Carmen should be elegant, not crude and vulgar, she said, adding: ''Even the common Gypsy women have a pride and reserve. They stay faithful to one man at a time, no matter what. That is my Carmen.''         After 1961, Ms. de los Angeles focused her career on recital work. One motivation was to slow down so that she could devote more time to raising a family. She gave birth to two sons in the mid-1960's: Juan Enrique and Alejandro.         Though she sang with such intellectually rigorous German artists as the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf and the baritone Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau, Ms. de los Angeles said her more instinctive approach was a result of her nationality.         ''We are a people that sings naturally,'' she said in a 1980 interview, adding, ''When we have a sorrow, it is a wonderful sorrow; when we have a happiness, it is a wonderful happiness, it is a big happiness.''       
         Myriam J. Altman, an appeals judge of the New York State Supreme Court since 1994, died on Jan. 29 at New York University Hospital. She was 65 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was complications of myelofibrosis, a bone marrow disorder, her family said.         Justice Altman resigned from the bench just days before her death. She was an associate justice of the Appellate Division's far-flung Second Department, based in Brooklyn, but had her chambers in Manhattan.         A New York judge since 1978, she was appointed to the Appellate Division by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. She was recommended several times by the Commission on Judicial Nominations for an appointment to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court and a rung above the Appellate Division.         Myriam Jarblum was born in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1939. Her family fled Belgium and the Nazi occupation in 1941, escaping via Vichy France, Spain and Portugal and managing to reach Cuba on one of the last refugee ships.         She was 7 when the family came to the United States. She graduated from Barnard College in 1959 and received her law degree from New York University Law School in 1963. Before she joined the bench, she was in private practice and served as a law secretary in court.         She was a judge on the New York City Civil Court from 1978 to 1987, sitting as an acting justice of State Supreme Court for most of those years, presiding over civil and, later, criminal cases. She was elected a Supreme Court justice in 1987 and served in its Civil Term until her promotion to the Appellate Division in January 1994.         She was a past member of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct and the Ethics Commission of the Unified Court System.         Justice Altman is survived by her husband, Herbert I. Altman, a former justice of State Supreme Court; two sons,, Michael T., of Woodmere, N.Y., and Daniel, of Teaneck, N.J.; a daughter, Sarah R. Stark of Raanana, Israel; a brother, William Jarblum of Los Angeles; and nine grandchildren.       
         Yolanda Garcia, a South Bronx community advocate who forced planners and politicians to rethink how they would rebuild a sprawling swath of the Melrose section, died on Thursday. She was 53.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Yolanda Gonzalez. She was stricken at the office of Nos Quedamos/We Stay, the community group she helped found in the early 1990's to prevent the eviction of hundreds of people who lived and worked in the neighborhood.         The vow embodied by the group's name became a rallying cry for Ms. Garcia, after she and her neighbors learned of a city redevelopment plan that would transform 30 blocks from rubble-covered lots into buildings that would house 4,000 families.         In a story she would recount often, proudly and with a wry smile, they found out about the plan by accident in 1992, when a resident noticed a city worker outside her house jotting down notes. Residents soon learned that the city had begun surveying the area to see which buildings were still occupied and who might have to be relocated as part of the Melrose Commons redevelopment plan.         Incensed by the idea that their reward for enduring years of abandonment, arson and crime would be eviction, they confronted officials during public hearings. Ms. Garcia, whose family owned a carpet store on Third Avenue, became one of the more outspoken leaders.         ''If this area deteriorated, it wasn't because of the people -- it deteriorated because of poor city planning,'' Ms. Garcia told The New York Times in 1993. ''If we kept our area up when it was in dire need of repair, we should be part of the progress.''         The confrontation turned into collaboration as politicians and planners invited the group to work alongside architects not only to critique the original plan, but also to redefine it. An apartment on Courtlandt Avenue was turned into a planning studio, where nearby residents pored over architectural drawings and models.         Fernando Ferrer, the Bronx borough president at the time and a proponent of the redevelopment plan, said Ms. Garcia offered insights that had to be heeded.         ''She was right,'' he said in an interview yesterday. ''They stuck it out in the toughest of times, and they were saying to government: 'You're planning for my neighborhood? Ask me.'''         Their suggestions ranged from allowing for lower-density housing to including numerous smaller gardens. The group sponsored construction of several dozen town houses and currently has 750 more units of rental and cooperative apartments in the pipeline. Their efforts became a model for community-based planning, said Richard Kahan, the former head of the New York State Urban Development Corporation who was active in the Melrose Commons plan.         Ms. Garcia was born in Santurce, P.R., and moved with her family to the Bronx when she was 6 months old. The family members moved often, always within the borough, as did their carpet business. She was helping run the business on a stretch of Third Avenue that had seen better days, when she became active in civic affairs.         She closed the carpet business several years ago to devote herself full time to her community work.         She is survived by her daughter, and one relentless community group.       
         Sandra Dee, the perennially perky, blond-haired and blue-eyed actress who helped American teenagers of the late 1950's and early 1960's cope with the frustrations of adolescent romance and the temptations of premarital sex, died yesterday at the Los Robles Hospital and Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, Calif. She was 62.         The cause of the death was complications from kidney disease, said Steve Blauner, a family friend.         Ms. Dee was probably best remembered for her portrayal of Gidget, a tomboyish California teenager who discovered the joys of surfing and boys in Paul Wendkos's 1959 film of the same name. The bright, chirpy Ms. Dee defined a new kind of natural, sun-soaked innocence that America, and much of the rest of the world, quickly embraced as the radiantly healthy, outdoorsy essence of Southern California living.         In 1960 she married the singer Bobby Darin, her costar in the 1961 romantic comedy ''Come September,'' after a whirlwind courtship. The story of her marriage to Darin, whom she divorced in 1967 and who himself died in 1973 at the age of 37, was chronicled in Kevin Spacey's recent theatrical film ''Beyond the Sea,'' in which Mr. Spacey played Darin and Ms. Dee was played by Kate Bosworth.         Ms. Dee followed ''Gidget'' with Delmer Daves's film ''A Summer Place'' (1959), in which she was paired with Troy Donohue as teenage lovers whose innocent confusion about how far their relationship should go ran up against the hypocrisy of an adult world -- a hypocrisy vividly embodied by their adulterous parents, played by Richard Egan and Dorothy McGuire. A tremendous commercial success, ''A Summer Place'' was among the earliest studio films to commodify youthful rebelliousness, though Ms. Dee was hardly an icon of adolescent revolt with her shiny helmet of flipped hair and color-coordinated outfits.         Born Alexandra Zuck on April 23, 1942, in Bayonne, N.J., she began modeling in New York at an early age. Appearances in television commercials led her to Hollywood, where she made her film debut in Robert Wise's 1957 ''Until They Sail.'' Her first substantial role came in Vincent Minnelli's romantic comedy ''The Reluctant Debutante'' (1958), in which she played the American-raised daughter of the Londoners Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall.         Ms. Dee soon proved to be as at home in melodrama as in comedy. She moved to Universal for Helmut Kautner's ''Restless Years,'' portraying the illegitimate daughter of a neurotic woman (Teresa Wright) trapped in a stifling small town. She remained at Universal for what was probably her finest sustained performance in certainly the most important of all her films, Douglas Sirk's grandly Brechtian soap opera ''Imitation of Life'' (1959).         Playing the neglected daughter of a driven, manipulative Broadway star (Lana Turner), Ms. Dee projected a genuinely touching fragility, and convincingly turned on her uncaring mother in one notable scene. ''Imitation of Life'' was Universal's biggest success of the 1950's, and prompted the studio to reunite Ms. Dee and Turner in the garish crime thriller ''Portrait in Black.''         Although Universal kept pushing her into teenage roles --as the barefoot, backwoods heroine of ''Tammy, Tell Me True'' (1961) and ''Tammy and the Doctor'' (1963, opposite an equally innocent young Peter Fonda) -- her widely publicized marriage to Darin made her seem less acceptable as an adolescent. In addition to ''Come September,'' Ms. Dee starred with her finger-snapping husband as a jealous young wife in ''If a Man Answers'' (1962) and as a maid posing as a successful publisher in ''That Funny Feeling'' (1965). In between, however, Ms. Dee returned to teenage roles, playing James Stewart's peacenik daughter in ''Take Her, She's Mine'' (1963).         After her troubled marriage to Darin came to an end, Ms. Dee seemed to lose interest in her acting career. Growing too old to play the perfect teenager (as she did again in the 1967 ''Rosie!''), she failed to make a convincing transition to adult roles, and soon she was appearing in small parts on television series. Her last starring role was in the low-budget film ''The Dunwich Horror'' (1970).         Ms. Dee is survived by her son, Dodd Darin, and two granddaughters. In 1994, Mr. Darin published, with Maxine Paetro, ''Dream Lovers: The Magnificent Shattered Lives of Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee,'' an account of his parents' relationship.         Correction:  February 23, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary of the actress Sandra Dee on Monday misspelled the surname of her co-star in ''A Summer Place'' and misstated the color of her eyes. The co-star was Troy Donahue, not Donohue, and her eyes were brown, not blue.       
         Simone Simon, the French actress of near-feline beauty best known to American audiences for her haunting role in the 1942 RKO horror film ''Cat People,'' died on Tuesday in Paris. She was 93.         Her death was announced by her friends and family to Agence France-Presse.         In ''Cat People'' Ms. Simon played a Serbian-born wife who fears that when her passions are aroused she will turn into a panther that kills. Her casting in this film and its mostly unrelated sequel, ''The Curse of the Cat People'' (RKO, 1944), was probably inspired by her role as the devil's emissary in ''All That Money Can Buy'' (RKO, 1941), an adaptation of Stephen Vincent Benet's short story ''The Devil and Daniel Webster,'' in which Ms. Simon's character steals a good man from his wife.         Ms. Simon made one other film for RKO, ''Mademoiselle Fifi'' (1944), an adaptation of two Guy de Maupassant stories about a French laundress who defies occupying German forces during the Franco-Prussian war. Although it was not a hit in the United States, it was the first American film to be shown in France after the Normandy invasion.         Ms. Simon was born on April 23, 1911, in Bèthune, France, to Henri Louis Firmin and Erma Maria Domenica Giorcelli. She grew up in Marseilles. After working briefly in Paris as a fashion designer and model, she made her stage debut in 1931 in the operetta ''Balthazar.''         The same year she appeared in her first film, ''Le Chanteur Inconnu'' (''The Unknown Singer''). After making about a dozen movies, she was summoned to Hollywood by Darryl Zanuck, the head of 20th Century Fox, to repeat her French ingénue roles, but despite her considerable acting talent and her distinctive looks, she failed to connect with a mass audience. The studio even tried to make her a singing star in ''Love and Hisses'' (1937) and ''Josette'' (1938), but she had a weak voice. Except for the four RKO films, her American work is largely forgotten.         In 1950 she returned to Europe to make films including ''La Ronde'' (1950) and ''Le Modèle,'' one of the three de Maupassant stories in the anthology ''Le Plaisir'' (1952); both were directed by Max Ophüls. Her last appearance was in Michel Deville's ''Femme en Bleu'' (1973).       
         Gwendolyn Knight, a painter and sculptor from the 1930's who emerged from the shadow of her husband, the painter Jacob Lawrence, late in her life, died on Feb. 18 at her home in Seattle. She was 91.         Although Ms. Knight did not begin to exhibit formally until the 1970's and was long known as the wife of Mr. Lawrence, a leading visual chronicler of the African-American experience, she began painting when she was young and was still setting out in new directions in old age.         This was evident in her first retrospective, titled ''Never Late for Heaven: The Art of Gwen Knight,'' at the Tacoma Art Museum in 2003. Having devoted most of her career to oil portraits of friends, figure studies of dancers, and watercolor and gouache landscapes that seemed to be companion pieces to her husband's work, she suddenly began in the 1990's to draw horses and cats from memory -- quick, lyrical sketches rendered as etchings and monoprints.         ''It wasn't necessary for me to have acclaim,'' she told Charles H. Rowell in an interview for Callaloo magazine in 1988. ''I just knew that I wanted to do it, so I did it whenever I could.''         Gwendolyn Clarine Knight was born in Bridgetown, Barbados, on May 26, 1913, the only child of Malcolm and Miriam Knight. Her father died when she was 2. In 1920, she traveled with a foster family to St. Louis, Mo., and then to New York City when she was 13.         After graduating in 1930 from the Wadleigh High School for Girls, an integrated school in Harlem, she spent two years at the Howard University School of Fine Arts, where she was encouraged by her teachers but had to drop out because of the Depression.         Returning to Harlem, she met the sculptor Augusta Savage, who became her mentor and obtained support for her from the Works Progress Administration. While taking classes at the Harlem Community Art Center she met Mr. Lawrence, whom she married in 1941.         She followed him when he taught at Black Mountain College in Ashville, N.C.; Brandeis University in Boston; and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. In 1949, when Mr. Lawrence was hospitalized with depression, she worked for a time for Condé Nast publications.         In the early 1960's, the couple lived in Nigeria, whose native arts influenced Ms. Knight. In 1971, they moved to Seattle, where Mr. Lawrence took a teaching position at the University of Washington School of Art and Ms. Knight had her first one-woman exhibition in 1976. Mr. Lawrence died in 2000.       
         Connie Scovill Small, known in maritime circles as the First Lady of Light for the decades she spent helping illuminate the night as the wife of a lighthouse keeper on the rugged New England coast, died on Jan. 25 at a nursing home in Portsmouth, N.H. She was 103.         Her death was announced by the American Lighthouse Foundation, of Wells, Me.         Active in the lighthouse preservation movement until shortly before her death, Mrs. Small lectured widely on her vanished way of life. Her memoir, ''The Lighthouse Keeper's Wife,'' first published when she was in her mid-80's, was reprinted by the University of Maine Press in 1999.         ''In the 19th century and early 20th century, any kind of state or federal policies that were made about lighthouse service included an understanding that women were part of that service,'' Andrea Constantine Hawkes, a historian who edited Mrs. Small's memoir, said in a telephone interview. ''And the government truly expected women to do these things and receive no money and no recognition.''         From 1920 to 1948, Mrs. Small worked alongside her husband, Elson, as he tended lighthouses in Maine and New Hampshire for the United States Lighthouse Service, later part of the Coast Guard. It was a solitary calling; most of the lighthouses to which the couple were posted were on tiny, windswept islands several miles off the coast. The work, Mrs. Small wrote, was ''a life of people risking their own lives to help men and ships; a life of order and duty.''         Every evening before sunset the couple lighted the lamp by hand, lugging cans of fuel up the tower stairs, trimming wicks, cleaning soot. They rose at dawn to extinguish the light. They endured lashing storms, injury and illness. In their first posting, Lubec Channel Light in northeastern Maine, they reached their quarters by way of an iron ladder on the outside of the tower that was slick with ice in winter. It was a 30-foot drop to the rocks below.         But for Mrs. Small, there were ample pleasures: correspondence courses from Betty Crocker, fresh clams dug up outside the house, friendships with summer visitors and the rough-hewn crew of a fishing boat who lumbered into her living room one day demanding to hear an opera on the radio.         Constance Scovill was born on June 4, 1901, in Lubec, Me., the easternmost town in the United States. The sea was in her blood: her grandfather was a captain, an uncle was a lighthouse keeper and her father was on the crew of the lifesaving station at nearby Quoddy Head. But Mrs. Small was afraid of the water and never learned to swim. She was also afraid of heights.         She married Elson Small in 1920, and for their first 28 years together they lived in keeper's quarters, some at the base of a lighthouse, others in the tower itself. There was seldom a telephone, electricity or plumbing.         Before Mr. Small retired in 1948, the couple also served at Seguin Light and St. Croix River Light in Maine, and Portsmouth Harbor Light in New Hampshire. After her husband's death in 1960, Mrs. Small worked in a Portsmouth department store and later as a head resident at Farmington State College in Maine. No immediate family members survive.         Automation has made the couple's work obsolete. Except for a largely ceremonial position at Boston Light, there are no more lighthouse keepers in the United States, according to the Lighthouse Foundation. The lights turn on by themselves.         ''I loved being in the tower at sunset,'' Mrs. Small wrote. ''When I took that lens cover off and the light flashed, I could begin counting from Portland to Pemaquid Point as almost simultaneously the lights came on -- 13 of them. It was like saying 'hello,' 'hello,' 'hello,' 'hello,' all down the coast.''       
         Eleanor Gould Packard, whose questions, comments and admonitions on the proofs of thousands of articles for The New Yorker for 54 years defined for many the care (some writers said obsessiveness) taken in editing the magazine, died Sunday in Manhattan. She was 87.         Her death was announced by her daughter, Susan Hathaway Packard.         Miss Gould, as she was known to the staff, challenged the logic, syntax, grammar, flow, usage, punctuation and vocabulary of a legion of nonfiction writers: E.B. White, Roger Angell, Wolcott Gibbs, Ved Mehta, Pauline Kael, Philip Hamburger, John McPhee, Lillian Ross. Many at The New Yorker believed the precisely penciled Gould proofs sustained its suavity of style.         David Remnick, the magazine's editor, once said: ''I think if there is an indispensable person here, it's Eleanor Gould. The relationship to her is as intimate as it gets; she has been inside my sentences.''         Invoking Harold Ross, the magazine's founding editor, Mr. Hamburger said, ''It is my impression that she brought to fruition an idea that Ross had, that everything should be looked at by a skeptical eye, not a cynical one, before it was presented to the public.''         Mr. Hamburger, who was interviewed several years before his death, sighed a little. ''Such probity and intelligence,'' he said.         Miss Gould's own view of her work was less glorified: ''I just try to make things right.''         Her work was not easily encompassed in a job title, and the magazine never saw a need to give her one. She was not a fact-checker, though she did find errors. She was not a story editor, copy editor or proofreader. She did not enter the process until an article had been examined by lawyers and editors and was in galley proof, close to the last minute. She worked her way down both margins, penciling corrections and suggestions in a legible hand, always providing her rationale.         ''A miracle to watch,'' said Edith Iglauer, an editor who once worked with her. ''The words danced across the page.''         As all editors know, showing such a thing to a tetchy or insecure writer might induce a tantrum. ''Not every writer gets to see a Gould proof,'' Mr. Angell said while she was still on the job. ''It's a challenge. You have to take a Gould proof seriously because she is a scrupulous reader, but you have to know what to ignore.'' If everything she recommended had been carried forward, he said, ''it would be like the purest water -- absolutely tasteless.''         Yet Mr. Remnick said on her death, ''If it's true The New Yorker is known for the clarity of its prose, then Miss Gould had as much to do with establishing that as its more famous editors and writers.''         He said that she had been greatly missed since a stroke took her off the job in 1999, but that there were still editors on the staff she had helped to train.         Miss Gould never used a computer and deadline pressure could sometimes render her handwritten work moot, especially during Tina Brown's chaotic six years as editor.         Eleanor Gould was born Oct. 3, 1917, in Newark, N.Y., to Wilson Mosher Gould, a lawyer, and Eleanor Loveland Gould. The family moved to Ohio and Eleanor graduated from high school in East Palestine, Ohio, in 1934. She won a scholarship to Oberlin and graduated summa cum laude with a major in English in 1938.         Aline Kilmer, a poet in New Jersey, became her mentor after years of correspondence Eleanor had initiated at 14. Kilmer taught her editing and helped her come to New York, and after several miserably paid editing jobs she applied to The New Yorker.         There was a myth that she flyspecked an entire issue and enclosed it with her application. But she described an application of less hubris: she noted two mistakes in recent issues, including, good Lord, a ''different than.''         She joined The New Yorker Nov. 5, 1945. Her marriage to Frederick A. Packard, also on the magazine's staff, came a year later, and the birth of their only child, Susan, a little more than a year after that. Her daughter and two grandsons survive.         In 1952, the family moved to Central Park West and 101st Street, where Miss Gould remained as long as she worked. She took a bus to the office on West 43rd Street, carrying a small lunch in an old shoe bag. For amusement, Miss Gould, who belonged at one time to Mensa, an organization of the supersmart, would factor the four-digit bus identification numbers.         In an interview in the summer of 1998, Miss Gould said she hoped to ''complete a century of Packards'' at The New Yorker. Her husband worked there for 45 years before he died in 1974. But for the stroke the year before, Miss Gould would have reached 55 years in 2000.         She was proud of her status. She cited the pinnacle she reached in 1972: a separate credit in ''The Elements of Style,'' the hugely popular text written by William Strunk Jr. and revived by E.B. White. The citation, which says, ''The co-author, E.B. White, is most grateful to Eleanor Gould Packard for her assistance in preparation of this second edition,'' recognized her as the linguistic equivalent of the Pope's confessor.         Interviewing Miss Gould for this obituary put the writer on the spot. Because she had been deaf since 1990, all questions had to be written; because of her status as a legendary editor, spelling counted. While asking about a Roger Angell statement, the interviewer at first wrote the name ''Angel,'' then added the second l. Miss Gould observed, ''I was going to say ''         Always the arbiter, she added, with amusement, ''I'll have to stage a faked death and come back to correct my obit.''       
         Former Representative Tillie Fowler, who despite being the most powerful woman in Congress did not run for re-election in 2000 to keep a promise to serve only four terms, died yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 62.         She had suffered a brain hemorrhage two days earlier, a family spokesman, Tom Alexander, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Fowler was vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and No.5 in the House leadership when she left Congress. Her steely intelligence earned her the nickname Steel Magnolia. A member of the House Armed Services Committee, she was known for her expertise on military matters, including vigorous efforts to retain armed services bases in her Florida district.         After leaving Congress in 2001 and joining a law firm, she continued her leadership role in military matters as chairwoman of both the commission that investigated sexual abuse accusations at the United States Air Force Academy and the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, which advises the secretary of defense.         Ms. Fowler was also on an independent panel that last year investigated the abuse of prisoners in Iraq, attributing the problem to a string of failures that led all the way up the chain of command to the Pentagon.         She was born on Dec. 23, 1942, in Milledgeville, Ga., where her father, Culver Kidd, owned a drug store. Mr. Kidd served for 44 years in the Georgia Legislature.         A photograph in Ms. Fowler's Congressional office showed her at age 7 playing on the desk of Gov. Herman Talmadge of Georgia. She recalled that she was arguing with him.         She earned a law degree from Emory University, where she also did her undergraduate work. She later worked as a Congressional aide and in the Nixon White House, in consumer affairs. In 1971, she moved to Jacksonville with her husband, Buck Fowler.         She threw herself into volunteer work, then used those contacts to run successfully for the Jacksonville City Council. Elected president of the Council, she had three members arrested in 1989, when they tried to walk out of a meeting, which would have prevented a quorum needed to pass the city budget.         In 1992, she ran for Congress, promising to serve no more than four terms. She received 57 percent of the vote and was unopposed in her next three races.         She got a seat on the Armed Services Committee and was elected co-chairwoman of the Freshman Republican Task Force on Reform. In her second term, she became a deputy whip for the Republicans. In late 1996, Speaker Newt Gingrich gave her and Representative Jane Harman, Democrat of California, the tough assignment of investigating sexual harassment in the Army.         In 1998, Ms. Fowler was elected vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference on the vow that she would serve no longer than two years in the Republican leadership. She filed papers in 1999 to seek re-election, but later decided to keep her initial promise.         She is survived by her husband and her daughters, Tillie Anne, of Washington, and Elizabeth, of California.       
         Opal Petty, whose lawsuit over her 51-year involuntary commitment in Texas mental institutions led to changes in state policy, died on March 10 in San Angelo, Tex. She was 86 and lived in Christoval, Tex.         The cause was pneumonia, said Linda Kauffman, the wife of Ms. Petty's nephew, Clint Denson.         Ms. Kauffman learned by chance at a 1986 reunion of her husband's family that Ms. Petty had been committed by her family to a state hospital in 1934, when she was 16. No one at the reunion knew exactly where she was at the time, Ms. Kauffman said in an interview, only that she was in some facility near where Ms. Kauffman lived.         When she got home to San Angelo, Ms. Kauffman called the institution closest to her home -- the San Angelo State School, in Carlsbad -- and found that Ms. Petty was indeed confined there.         She began to see Ms. Petty and arranged for her to make visits to the Denson home. The more she got to know Ms. Petty, Ms. Kauffman said, the more nervous and uncooperative school officials became.         Eventually she sought legal advice and was directed to Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, who filed suit on Ms. Petty's behalf. Through pretrial discovery, it was learned that she had been given a diagnosis of schizophrenia. But her lawyers argued that at worst she had had a psychotic depression. They also said she had suffered irreparable harm from being held in a ''prison-like environment'' for so long.         Dr. Jefferson Nelson, an Austin psychiatrist, testified, based on Ms. Petty's records and a personal examination, that she was psychotic when she was admitted, but that her symptoms quickly subsided, and that she should have been released.         He also testified that as a result of being institutionalized, Ms. Petty was afflicted with an ''institutional syndrome'' that left her withdrawn and unable to express emotion.         In 1989, the jury found the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation guilty of negligence and awarded Ms. Petty $505,000, which was reduced to $350,000 because of a state law that limits damages resulting from the actions of state employees, Mr. Harrington said in an interview.         As a result of the suit, the state made several changes, among them enacting annual hearings for all those who are confined, with the result that several other people were released from state institutions.         Ms. Petty was born on April 28, 1918, in Mills County, Tex., the third of six children of Robert Clinton Petty, a farmer, and Willie Mae Petty.         Mr. Harrington said: ''Being fundamentalist Baptists her family didn't approve of her wanting to go out dancing and such things. A church exorcism didn't work, so the family made the decision to commit her. One of her girl friends said she didn't see anything wrong with her.''         After Ms. Kauffman found her, Ms. Petty was furloughed from the state school and lived with Ms. Kauffman and her husband for almost 20 years. She was employed at a workshop for people with mental disabilities, and bought dolls to add to a collection she had started while confined.         ''They were her family,'' Ms. Kauffman said. ''When she was buried she was surrounded by her dolls.''       
         Midori Shimanouchi Lederer, who as founder and president emeritus of Japanese American Social Services Inc. helped provide social services to Asians and Asian-Americans in New York, died on March 9 at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was respiratory failure, her husband, Peter, said.         Mrs. Lederer founded the organization in 1981. It assists the elderly, abused women, hospital patients who do not speak English and others.         Midori Shimanouchi was born in Fresno, Calif., on April 11, 1923.         At age 18, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she was interned with her family at Topaz, Utah. Two years later, she came to New York, where she worked as a film publicist. She later volunteered with the Lower East Side Center, which helped elderly drug addicts, and with Japanese American Help for the Aging.         The recipient of many awards, Mrs. Lederer shunned publicity, saying she did not wish to embarrass her clients.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Lederer is survived by a sister, Ida Shimanouchi, of Medford, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Patricia Lederer Michaels, of Manhattan; and one stepgrandson.       
         Lisa Fittko, who achieved fame, particularly in Germany, by leading Jews and members of the anti-Hitler resistance from Nazi-occupied France to Spain, died on March 12 in Chicago. She was 95.         The cause was pneumonia, said Evelyn Marsh, her niece.         Ms. Fittko emerged from a leftist, artistic family to become active in the resistance to Hitler in the early months of his rule, then fled to continue the fight in other European countries for seven years. For seven tense months in 1940 and 1941, she escorted refugees on a tortuous path over the Pyrenees mountains so they could go on to Spanish and Portuguese ports to seek passage to safe havens.         Many of the people she helped were intellectuals, artists and anti-Nazi organizers. The first refugee she helped was Walter Benjamin, a Marxist literary critic and philosopher whose work has drawn new interest in recent years because of his provocative insights on subjects from consumerism to surrealism.         But that initial mission was thwarted when the Spanish authorities ordered the group to return to France because they lacked proper exit visas, a requirement that had not been enforced in the past and was ignored in the future. Mr. Benjamin died at the age of 48 in Room No.4 on the second floor of the Hotel de Francia, a cheap pension in Port-Bou, Spain, on Sept. 27, 1940, having apparently committed suicide.         Ms. Fittko had earlier helped the philosopher Hannah Arendt, who had been her friend in Paris, get out of a prison in France.         Ms. Fittko and her husband, Hans, became part of the rescue mission of Varian Fry, an American who is credited with saving about 2,000 people, many of them artists and intellectuals, including André Breton, Marc Chagall and Max Ernst.         Miriam Hansen, a professor of English and cinema and media studies at the University of Chicago, said Ms. Fittko became well known in postwar Germany because Germans liked to find and honor people who resisted Hitler. She said Ms. Fittko's death was announced on German radio and television, and obituaries appeared in the major national newspapers. In 1986, the president of West Germany awarded her the Distinguished Medal of Merit, First Class.         In the United States, Ms. Fittko's story was eventually documented in several novels and films, including the 1998 documentary ''Lisa Fittko: But We Said We Will Not Surrender.''         She wrote two books about her experiences. One, ''Escape Through the Pyrenees,'' which was first published in West Germany in 1985, won that country's award for the political book of the year. It was translated into French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, and, in 1991, into English by Northwestern University Press. The same press in 1993 published her ''Solidarity and Treason: Resistance and Exile, 1933-1940.''         Lisa Ekstein was born in 1909 in Uzhgorod in what was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire; it later became part of Czechoslovakia, then part of the Soviet Union and today is part of Ukraine. Most of her childhood was spent in Budapest and Vienna; she was evacuated and sent to the Netherlands with other children for a year during World War I. After the war, her family moved to Berlin.         Through her father, a writer and a publicist for avant-garde artists there, she met many members of the Weimar intelligentsia.         While still in high school, she joined what Ms. Hansen characterized as a Communist organization. She wrote and distributed leaflets protesting torture in Nazi prisons.         At 24 she was working as a secretary and went to a rally to see Hitler. She was reprimanded for not raising her arm in salute. She told an interviewer from The Vancouver Sun in 1999 that her failure to do so was hardly intentional.         ''I was stupid, but not that stupid,'' she said.         She was soon pursued by the Gestapo, and in 1933, she fled to Prague, where she met Hans Fittko, a fellow exile and an even more committed leftist whom the Nazis sought to kill. They married on their odyssey through, among other places, Basel and Amsterdam, ending up in Paris in 1938. There, they continued helping refugees.         After Germany invaded France, Ms. Fittko was detained for a few months in a concentration camp for women at Gurs, France, along with others who had lived in Germany. It was there she aided her friend and fellow prisoner Hannah Arendt by helping to supply her with a stolen release document.         After the Fittkos found each other again, they made their way to Marseille, dodging the French authorities who were collaborating with the Germans. They planned to escape through Spain but separated because the Spanish had begun arresting men who they feared might make their way to Britain to fight Hitler.         Mr. Fittko tried to find sea passage from Marseille to Casablanca. His wife, as originally planned, had gone to the border to find a way to escape by land. In September 1940, Walter Benjamin knocked on the door of her room in Port-Vendres, saying Mr. Fittko had told him to ask her for help.         With the assistance of a local socialist mayor, who gave her an old map, she led Mr. Benjamin and two other refugees across the mountains to Port-Bou, a Spanish border town. Mr. Benjamin died there after swallowing some of the 50 morphine tablets he had earlier split with his friend Arthur Koestler.         Mr. Benjamin had been carrying a heavy, bulging briefcase that he told Ms. Fittko contained ''the only copy of his latest writing.'' She wrote that he said it was ''more important than I am, more important than myself.''         The briefcase was lost after his death and its contents remain unknown.         For years people suspected that it might have been his lost work on the Parisian arcades, iron-and-glass-roofed shopping corridors, which provoked penetrating philosophical insights on the part of Mr. Benjamin. But those papers were discovered in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, where Mr. Benjamin's friend the essayist Georges Batailles had hidden them from the Nazis. They were published in West Germany in 1982.         Howard Eiland, who translated them as ''The Arcades Project,'' published in 1999 by Harvard University Press, said the contents of the lost briefcase remained a mystery. He said, ''This sounds like it was something completely different that no one knows about.''         Ms. Fittko was soon joined on the French side of the border by her husband, who had not been able to find sea passage. They delayed their own escape when Mr. Fry asked them to help take refugees into Spain. They pretended to be vineyard workers and took people across the mountains on what was called the F route (for Fittko) two or three times a week for seven months. The number of those they helped is sometimes estimated in the hundreds; not one was caught, they said.         The Fittkos eventually escaped to Cuba, then went on to Chicago, where Ms. Fittko's brother lived. Mr. Fittko died in 1960, and Ms. Fittko left no immediate survivors.         She returned to Spain several times to look for Mr. Benjamin's lost briefcase, but never found it.         Correction:  March 22, 2005, Tuesday  An obituary yesterday about Lisa Fittko, the anti-Hitler activist, misspelled the surname of the French essayist who helped hide the writings of Walter Benjamin, the German literary critic and philosopher. He was Georges Bataille, not Batailles.       
         Cushing N. Dolbeare, a leading expert on federal housing policy and a longtime campaigner for affordable housing for low-income people, died on March 17 at her home in Mitchellville, Md. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the research and advocacy group Ms. Dolbeare founded in 1974.         A respected policy analyst and consultant, Ms. Dolbeare was an adviser to several secretaries of housing and urban development and was a former member of the President's Commission on Housing. In 1996, The New York Times Magazine called her ''the dean of housing advocates.''         Ms. Dolbeare founded the coalition in response to President Richard M. Nixon's 1973 moratorium on federal housing subsidies. In the organization's early days, she ran it out of her Capitol Hill home. She was its executive director from 1977 to 1984 and from 1993 to 1994; at her death she was its chairwoman emeritus.         As Ms. Dolbeare explained in an interview with The New York Times in 1983, the lack of affordable housing was for poor people a chronic problem with limited available solutions.         ''Unlike food stamps or Medicaid or welfare, low-income housing is not an entitlement,'' she said. ''Just needing it does not mean you get it.''         Mary Cushing Niles was born in Hartford on June 25, 1926, the daughter of Henry Edward Niles and the former Mary Cushing Howard. Her parents were management consultants, and Ms. Dolbeare had a peripatetic childhood as they moved around the country from one consulting job to the next. By the time she graduated from high school, she had attended 10 to 20 schools, her family said.         Ms. Dolbeare earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Swarthmore College in 1949 and began her career as a housing advocate in 1951, as associate executive secretary of the Citizens Planning and Housing Association of Baltimore. From 1965 to 1971 she was managing director of the Housing Association of Delaware Valley and, from 1967 to 1968, a consultant for the United States Commission on Civil Rights.         Ms. Dolbeare served on the President's Commission on Housing from 1981 to 1982. In 2002, she received the Heinz Award for the Human Condition from the Heinz Family Foundation; she was named a senior scholar at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard the same year.         Ms. Dolbeare is survived by her husband, Louis P. Dolbeare; a sister, Alice Lynd of Niles, Ohio; two children, L. Niles Dolbeare of San Francisco and Mary Dolbeare O'Kane of Seattle; and four grandchildren.       
         Leona Rostenberg, a rare-book scholar and dealer who with her partner of 50 years, Madeleine B. Stern, discovered a series of racy novels written by Louisa May Alcott under a pseudonym, died on March 17 at her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 96.         Ms. Rostenberg died after having heart problems for two years, said Abbey Lustgarten, a filmmaker who became friends with the two women while making a documentary about them.         The discovery in 1942 of the works by Alcott, all written before she gained fame as the author of ''Little Women,'' brought a moment of detective-work thrill for Ms. Rostenberg and her partner and forever altered Alcott scholarship.         A past president of the Antiquarian Booksellers' Association of America, Ms. Rostenberg wrote numerous books herself: scholarly works on printing history, and memoirs written with Ms. Stern that twinned their love of literary sleuthing with reminiscences of their life together.         Ms. Rostenberg's relationship with Ms. Stern, whom she met in 1930 and with whom she lived for nearly 50 years, runs like a constant thread through her decades in the world of rare books.         Writing in The New York Times in 1995, Dinitia Smith described the partnership as ''both a love story and a detective story, a tale of doggedness and devotion to books and to each other.''         That article led an editor to approach the women about doing a memoir of their lives; they had already written several books together about their profession and their experiences hunting down this or that volume. The result was ''Old Books, Rare Friends: Two Literary Sleuths and Their Shared Passion'' (Doubleday, 1997).         In it they evaluated their own relationship on Page 3. Referring to the article in The Times, they wrote: ''Several readers inferred from it that our relationship was a lesbian one. This was a misconception. The 'deep, deep love' that existed and exists between us and that is mentioned in Dinitia Smith's last paragraph has no bearing upon sex.''         The follow-up work, ''Bookends: Two Women, One Enduring Friendship'' (Free Press, 2001), focused even more on their relationship and intertwined personal lives, including a chapter called ''Men We Did Not Marry.''         Leona Rostenberg was born in the Bronx on December 28, 1908, to Dr. Adolph and Louisa D. Rostenberg. Her father was a dermatologist. She met Ms. Stern in 1930 while she was a senior at New York University and Ms. Stern was a freshman at Barnard.         Ms. Stern lent Ms. Rostenberg $1,000 to start her rare-book business and eventually joined her as partner. They lived first in Ms. Rostenberg's family house in the Bronx, and then in Manhattan.         They made their discovery about Louisa May Alcott after being tipped off by a scholar that she might have written works under a pseudonym to pay the rent, but that the pseudonym was mystery.         After seeing a reference to an ''A.M. Barnard'' in a correspondence between Alcott and a publisher, they knew they had found what -- or whom -- they had been looking for.         The discovery caused a re-evaluation of Alcott's career. Eventually, one of the lost Alcott works, ''A Long Fatal Love Chase,'' was published.         ''It completely changed the way people perceived Louisa May Alcott,'' Ms. Lustgarten said. ''What they knew about was 'Little Women,' and here were 'blood and thunder' tales -- meetings in opium dens and things like that. The polar opposite of 'Little Women' in the sense of being more risqué and passionate.''         Ms. Rostenberg is survived by two cousins, Richard F. Koch and Marion Alexander.       
         Katherine A. Lathrop, a pioneering researcher in nuclear medicine and a member of a University of Chicago team that developed an isotope widely used to locate and diagnose cancers, died on March 10 at a nursing home in Las Cruces, N.M. She was 89.         The cause was advanced dementia, her family said.         A versatile scientist with degrees in biology, chemistry and physics, Ms. Lathrop was named a professor of radiology at Chicago, where she taught for four decades, without having received a doctorate.         In 1945 and 1946, she participated in the Manhattan Project as a junior chemist in the metallurgical laboratory in Chicago, studying the effects of radioactive materials on animals. Later, as part of a research effort led by Dr. Paul V. Harper, she investigated the qualities of technetium, a radioactive element discovered in the 1930's.         Ms. Lathrop and the Chicago team experimented with an isotope, technetium 99m, by injecting it into a patient's bloodstream and then tracing its path through the brain, heart, kidney, liver and other organs.         A scan of the isotope, also called a radionuclide or radiotracer, yielded images to help diagnose and record the size and growth of cancers and other tumors. Dr. Harper's team also found technetium was less radioactive and had a shorter half-life than many other isotopes, and was therefore less dangerous to patients. A scanning system for technetium was perfected in 1963 and was used to perform a successful brain scan. The isotope remains in clinical use worldwide and is often used to scan bones.         Dr. Robert Beck, an emeritus professor of radiology at Chicago and a member of Dr. Harper's team, recalled that Ms. Lathrop was ''an indispensable part of Paul Harper's team.''         Dr. Beck added, ''After that initial successful scan, the field of nuclear medicine took a major and continuing upward turn.''         Katherine Gray Austin was born in Lawton, Okla. She graduated from Oklahoma State University, where she also received a master's degree in chemistry in 1939.         Ms. Lathrop was appointed an associate biochemist at the Argonne National Laboratory, where she worked from 1947 to 1954. She next joined the staff of the Argonne Cancer Research Hospital, now the Franklin McLean Memorial Research Institute, which is affiliated with the University of Chicago. In 1978, she was appointed professor of radiology at Chicago, a position she held until retiring in 1985.         Ms. Lathrop served as chairwoman of the Society of Nuclear Medicine's Medical Internal Radiation Dose Committee from 1977 to 1984.         Ms. Lathrop lived in Hyde Park, Ill., before moving to Las Cruces last year.         She is survived by a son, Dr. David Lathrop, a physiologist at the National Institutes of Health, of Gaithersburg, Md.; three daughters, Laura Fowler of Santa Fe, N.M., Jane Grider of Las Cruces and Julia Smiddy of Valparaiso, Ind.; a sister, Billie Carol Austin of Denver; a brother, John C. Austin of Duncan, Okla.; 10 grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.       
         Isabelle Goldenson, who worked for people with disabilities, including her oldest daughter, as a founder of United Cerebral Palsy, died on Feb. 21 at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 84.         Her death was announced by her family.         People with disabilities were often separated from their families and institutionalized at the time that Mrs. Goldenson and her husband, Leonard H. Goldenson, former head of ABC, were raising their daughter Genise.         In 1945, the Goldensons and another couple, Jack and Ethel Hausman, reached out to other parents of children with cerebral palsy by placing an advertisement in The New York Herald Tribune. United Cerebral Palsy was founded in 1949.         Mrs. Goldenson and her husband lobbied for wheelchair access to sidewalks and restrooms; donated at least $60 million to research on neurological diseases; and even recruited NASA to their cause.         ''If we can put a man on the moon,'' she asked at a dinner party in 1971, ''why can't we develop a lightweight wheelchair for people with disabilities?'' NASA engineers soon constructed such a wheelchair as well as medical monitoring equipment.         In 1955, Mrs. Goldenson convinced Dr. Sidney Farber of the need for research toward preventing cerebral palsy. He recruited 14 other medical scientists for what became the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation.         Through its network of affiliates, United Cerebral Palsy provides daily services to more than 30,000 people.         Isabelle Charlotte Weinstein was born in Manhattan on May 18, 1920. She attended Barnard College and Columbia University and studied at the Union Theological Seminary.         She is survived by two daughters, Loreen Arbus of New York and Los Angeles and Maxine Goldenson of Los Angeles; and a grandson. Her daughter Genise died at the age of 29 in 1973, and her husband died in 1999.       
         Sara Stein, an influential advocate for gardening with native plants, died Feb. 25 at her home in Vinalhaven, Me. She was 69.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Martin Stein.         In ''Noah's Garden: Restoring the Ecology of Our Own Backyards'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1993), Ms. Stein lamented the effects of traditional suburban landscaping on her six-acre homestead in Pound Ridge, N.Y., three acres of which were scraped in the 1930's to provide topsoil for the 1939 New York World's Fair.         She wrote how she and her husband had undertaken the process of ''ungardening,'' or changing what had become an environment of sterile lawn and plantings into carefully researched ecosystems representing swamp, prairie, rock barren and other native environments. The result attracted birds, small mammals and other wildlife.         ''Noah's Garden,'' which mingled good-humored anecdotes about her family with widely applicable advice, caught the attention of gardeners and homeowners around the country and became a bible for a growing native landscape movement. Ms. Stein was soon in demand as a speaker to gardening and environmental groups.         She followed the book with ''Planting Noah's Garden: Further Adventures in Backyard Ecology'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1997) and ''Noah's Children: Restoring the Ecology of Childhood'' (North Point Press, 2001), a meditation on the role the natural environment plays in childhood development.         Ms. Stein was born Sara Bonnett in Manhattan on Oct. 7, 1935, the second of three daughters of Earl Clough Bonnett, an insurance medical examiner, and Sara Bonnett, a psychoanalyst. She attended Cornell College for a year and earned her bachelor's degree in Russian studies at the New School for Social Research. In 1959, she married Mr. Stein, an architect.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Stein is survived by four sons, Lincoln, of Glen Cove, N.Y.; Rafael, of Ramsey, N.J.; Joshua, of Acton, Mass.; and Aram, of Richmond, Calif.; two sisters, Suzanne Caffuzzi, of Manhattan, and Diantha Guessous, of Rabat, Morocco; and six grandchildren.         Ms. Stein began her career as a toy designer, which led to her writing children's books. She started off in 1974 with a series on sensitive subjects like hospitals, dying and handicaps. The books were subtitled ''An Open Family Book for Parents and Children Together'' (Walker & Company). In 1979 she added ''On Divorce'' and ''The Adopted One'' to the series, and in 1983 ''About Phobias'' and ''Making Babies.'' The same year she published ''Girls and Boys: The Limits of Nonsexist Childrearing'' (Scribner's).         Among her other books is a series on how to raise various pets that led to ''Great Pets: An Extraordinary Guide to Usual and Unusual Family Pets'' (Workman, 1976).         Another series explained science to children and included ''The Science Book'' (Workman, 1980), ''The Evolution Book'' (Workman, 1986) and ''The Body Book'' (Workman, 1992). Ms. Stein's focus turned to gardening with ''My Weeds: A Gardener's Botany'' (1988).         Ms. Stein, who sometimes illustrated her own books, created a handmade dollhouse that was exhibited at the Museum of the City of New York for more than a year and became the basis of ''A Family Dollhouse'' (Viking, 1979).       
         Alice Thomas Ellis, a British novelist celebrated for her witty, unflinching dissections of middle-class domestic life, died on Tuesday in London. She was 72 and lived in Wales.         A spokeswoman for Ms. Ellis's literary agent, Robert Kirby, confirmed the death. No cause was given, but several British newspapers reported that Ms. Ellis had been ill with lung cancer for some time.         Far better known in Britain than in the United States, Ms. Ellis's fiction defied easy categorization. With its blend of the transcendently spiritual and the achingly mundane, her work was compared, variously, to that of Virginia Woolf, Evelyn Waugh, Iris Murdoch and Muriel Spark.         Alice Thomas Ellis was the pseudonym of Anna Margaret Haycraft, who under her real name was an editor at Gerald Duckworth, the London publishing house run by her husband, Colin Haycraft.         Under her pen name, Ms. Ellis wrote a dozen slender novels, most published by Duckworth, among them ''The Sin Eater'' (1977); ''The Birds of the Air'' (1980); ''The Summer House,'' a trilogy (Penguin, 1994); and ''Fairy Tale'' (Moyer Bell, 1998). Her novel ''The 27th Kingdom'' (1982) was finalist for the Booker Prize.         She also published several nonfiction works, including ''A Welsh Childhood'' (Moyer Bell, 1997) and ''Serpent on the Rock: A Personal View of Christianity'' (Hodder & Stoughton, 1994).         Reviewing ''The Summer House'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1994, Francine Prose wrote, ''Its quick humor, prickly ironies and lack of portentous self-importance may mislead casual readers into overlooking its true heft, its provocative and disturbing shrewdness.''         Shot through with melancholy, Ms. Ellis's novels focus on the small savageries, deep discontents and abiding grief of women's lives. Yet they are also mordantly funny sendups of bourgeois manners. Sometimes, as in the work of Shirley Jackson, the gothic overlays the domestic, to unsettling effect. Many of Ms. Ellis's characters are repellent, and they are meant to be.         A spare stylist, Ms. Ellis could sketch a devastating portrait in a single phrase. In ''The Birds of the Air,'' she describes one character, an academic, as a man whose ''insistence on ordinary language and absolute clarity of expression rendered his discourse unintelligible to the ordinary person.''         Ms. Ellis was born Anna Margaret Lindholm in Liverpool on Sept. 9, 1932, and raised in Wales. Her father and mother were devout secular humanists, and at 19, Anna rebelled by converting to Roman Catholicism.She entered a convent as a postulant, but back problems forced her to leave the order, with its requirement of physical labor. She settled in London, where she met Mr. Haycraft; they were married in 1956 and had seven children. She eventually joined him as a fiction editor at Duckworth, where her list of writers included the novelist Beryl Bainbridge.         In 1977 Ms. Ellis published her own first novel, ''The Sin Eater.'' Set in Wales, it tells of a family drawn uneasily home by the impending death of its patriarch. In The Spectator, Peter Ackroyd praised the book for ''its wit: the relentlessness of domestic life, the knives only just sheathed in time.'' Ms. Ellis's pen name, chosen perhaps for its sibilant hiss, suited her style of elegant malice.         Ms. Ellis, who also wrote on domestic life and religion for several British publications, remained a passionately traditional Catholic who deplored efforts to modernize the church. In 1996 she was fired as a columnist for The Catholic Herald after she attacked the reforms of Derek Worlock, archbishop of Liverpool, who had recently died.         Ms. Ellis is survived by four sons, William, Thomas, Oliver and Arthur, and a daughter, Sarah. Another daughter, Rosalind Mary, died in infancy, and a son, Joshua, died in an accident as a teenager. Ms. Ellis's husband died in 1994.         Throughout her work, on subjects large and small, Ms. Ellis was concerned with the futility of connection. In 1987 The Times of London asked several prominent people to compose a Valentine's Day verse. Ms. Ellis's submission began, dryly: ''Men love women/Women love children/Children love hamsters.''       
         Maria Schell, an Austrian actress who achieved international fame in Hollywood and became a major star of German-language films, died on Tuesday at her home in Preitenegg, Austria. She was 79.         The cause was heart failure, the mayor of Preitenegg, Franz Kogler, told the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur.         Before she went to Hollywood in the 1950's, Ms. Schell, who was sometimes called ''the blond angel,'' was already a celebrated film figure in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, where she was often typecast as a charming girl from the Alps.         Ms. Schell was named best actress at the Cannes film festival in 1954 for her portrayal of a young doctor in ''Die Letzte Brücke'' (''The Last Bridge'') and became internationally known for her role as Grushenka in ''The Brothers Karamazov'' in 1958.         She also appeared in several American movies alongside actors like Gary Cooper, in ''The Hanging Tree'' in 1959, and Marlon Brando, in ''Superman'' in 1978.         Ms. Schell made more than 200 film and television appearances, mostly in German. She was also a prominent stage actress in Austria and Germany.         She was born in Vienna on Jan. 15, 1926, the daughter of a Swiss writer and an Austrian actress. She grew up with three siblings who all went into acting, including Maximilian, her younger brother by four years, who also became a star. In 1938, the family moved to Switzerland, where, in 1942, at the age of 16, she appeared in her first film, the Swiss ''Der Steinbruch'' (''The Quarry'').         Even though her debut was not very successful, Ms. Schell decided to study drama in Zurich. She did not make another movie until she starred in Karl Hartl's Austrian-German 1948 production ''Der Engel mit der Posaune'' (''The Angel With the Trumpet''), the first film to bring her recognition abroad.         In 2002, Ms. Schell made her last public appearance at a presentation of ''Meine Schwester Maria'' (''My Sister Maria''), Maximilian's documentary about her life.         The Austrian film critic Alexander Horwath said she was ''one of the very few stars of postwar German-speaking cinema who had a lasting impact on the international film scene,'' Agence France-Presse reported.         Ms. Schell's two marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was the film director Horst Hächler. Her second marriage, to the Austrian actor Veit Relin, ended after 22 years in 1988. In her last years, Ms. Schell suffered several strokes and led a secluded life at her home in the Alps.         Survivors include Maximilian; her son, Oliver, from her first marriage; and her daughter, Marie-Theres, from her second marriage.       
         Charlotte Kempner Beyers, a documentary filmmaker whose works were among the first to introduce students to the realities of AIDS, died on March 10 at her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 73.         The cause was complications of lymphoma, her family said.         The producer and writer of 15 films, Ms. Beyers began her career as a print journalist, writing about science and education for a variety of publications. She made her first film, ''AIDS in Your School,'' after a brother-in-law's death from AIDS in 1985. That film, along with her later ones about AIDS, was distributed to schools and youth groups by the World Health Organization.         Ms. Beyers's other films include ''A Is for AIDS'' and ''AIDS and Women: The Greatest Gamble,'' as well as movies about drug abuse, disability and homelessness.         Charlotte Kempner was born in Manhattan on Dec. 8, 1931; her father, S. Marshall Kempner, was a prominent investment banker. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Stanford University in 1953 and a master's in journalism from Stanford in 1968.         Ms. Beyers's first marriage, to Gerald Davis, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Robert West Beyers, died in 2002. She is survived by a sister, Phyllis Kempner; four children from her first marriage: Pamela Davis Kivelson, Nancy Stewart, Alan Davis and Cynthia Kanner; three stepchildren: Bill Beyers, Robbie Beyers and Amy Theorin; and 13 grandchildren and step-grandchildren.       
         Ida Libby Dengrove, a New York courtroom artist who visualized the moods and faces of some notorious trials for the television audience, died on Wednesday while on a family visit to Los Angeles. She was 86 and lived in Ocean Township, N.J.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         A portrait painter away from court, Mrs. Dengrove worked as a courtroom illustrator for NBC-TV from 1973 to 1986. It allowed her to take her sketch pad where cameras were forbidden and capture the proceedings in her own distinctive style.         Her pictorial reportage won two Emmy awards. She was cited for her newscast illustrations of the sensational Son of Sam trial of David Berkowitz (1977-78), and again for the Murder at the Met trial (1980-81) of Craig S. Crimmins, the stagehand convicted of slaying a young violinist, Helen Hagnes Mintiks.         She sketched the principals in the trial of Jean Harris for the murder of Dr. Herman Tarnower and documented court appearances by John Lennon, Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr., John W. Hinckley Jr., John J. Gotti and Gen. William C. Westmoreland, to name a few. Some of her sketches, meant for television, also turned up on the front pages of newspapers.         Ida Libby Leibovitz was born in Philadelphia, where she later graduated, in 1940, from Moore College of Art and Design. She taught art in the city's public school system until World War II, which she spent touring the United States for the U.S.O., sketching servicemen.         Later in her career, she taught again and lectured at various colleges and organizations.         Mrs. Dengrove's husband of 64 years, Dr. Edward Dengrove, a psychiatrist, died in 2003. She is survived by two sons, Richard A., of Arlington, Va., and Robert S., of Ocean Township; a daughter, Lois Ann, of Los Angeles; and four granddaughters.         Mrs. Dengrove herself fell victim to a crime in 1982. Eighty of her courtroom sketches were mounted in a lobby show at the United States Court House at Foley Square, a gallery of the famous in a place normally brimming with guards and federal marshals.         Yet one Monday morning, a portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono was gone from its place high up on a wall. She had caught the couple in pastel in 1975, when deportation charges against Lennon were dropped, and -- her usual procedure -- had kept the original after it was taped for broadcast.         ''They took it like they took the Mona Lisa,'' she noted at the time. ''They removed it from the frame and left the frame and mat on the lobby floor.''         ''Somebody must have climbed on a chair,'' she said.       
         Carol Rothschild Noyes, a supporter of civic and environmental causes, died on April 18 at her home in Laurel Hollow, N.Y. She was 88.         Her family announced the death.         Mrs. Noyes sat on the boards of the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Woods Hole Oceanographic Center, Planned Parenthood of New York City, and the Rocky Mountain Institute in Old Snowmass, Colo. She was a trustee of the Brearley School and Vassar College.         Carol Warburg Rothschild was born in Manhattan. She graduated from Vassar in 1939, and in the late 1940's she and a friend, Dottie Noyes, owned a New York furniture store, New Design, that sold contemporary creations by the Eameses, Saarinen and Aalto.         Mrs. Noyes's first marriage, to Amory Bradford, ended in divorce in 1963; he died in 1998. She was the widow of Charles P. Noyes, who died in 1994. She is survived by two sons, Peter A. Bradford of Peru, Vt., and David A. Bradford of Guilford, Vt.; three daughters, Carola Lea of Lyme, N.H., Madhavi Bradford of Darlington, Idaho, and Deborah Bradford of Aspen, Colo.; a sister, Phyllis Farley of Manhattan; two stepsons, Charles P. Noyes III of Spencertown, N.Y., and James McC. Noyes of Hood River, Ore.; and eight grandchildren.       
         Ludmilla Nikitina Shapiro, a Russian-born journalist and photographer who with her husband amassed a collection of Soviet-era political porcelain considered the most comprehensive in North America, died on May 8 in Madison, Wis., where she lived. She was 91.         Mrs. Shapiro's death was announced by her granddaughter, Alexandra Corten.         Over six decades, Mrs. Shapiro and her husband, Henry, built their collection through donations, by scouring consignment shops and by occasional gentle larceny. (Mrs. Shapiro once lifted a cigarette holder from the Kremlin.) The collection was acquired in 1989 by the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York.         Mr. Shapiro, a longtime Moscow correspondent for United Press International, died in 1991.         Comprising more than 250 objects made between the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the advent of glasnost in the 1980's, the Shapiro collection includes dinnerware, statuettes and other ceramics emblazoned with words and images intended to convey Soviet glories.         Much of the collection is magnificent kitsch. An enameled porcelain figurine from the 1960's depicts two little cosmonauts standing proudly before their spacecraft. A 1937 dinner plate, depicting a beefy young woman in a bathing suit at its center and other athletes around the rim, extols the virtues of physical fitness.         Mrs. Shapiro, who with her husband endured World War II and the terrors of the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union, insisted that neither ideology nor aesthetics motivated the collection.         ''We didn't collect these porcelains as art,'' she told The New York Times in 1992. ''We felt they illustrated Soviet history.''         Ludmilla Nikitina was born in Moscow on June 11, 1913, to a prominent family of artists and intellectuals. She earned a degree from the Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages and another, in artistic translation, from the Gorky Literary Institute in Moscow.         In 1933, she married Mr. Shapiro, a Romanian-born American journalist. She worked alongside him as a journalist and translator, contributing articles and photographs to American and British publications. (She photographed Nikita Khrushchev, Boris Pasternak and Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, among others.)         As the Moscow representative of the American impresario Sol Hurok, Mrs. Shapiro also helped persuade the Soviet government to let the Bolshoi Ballet perform in the United States, her granddaughter said.         With her husband, Mrs. Shapiro came to the United States in 1954. The couple later returned to the Soviet Union for nearly two decades, settling permanently in the United States in 1973.         Besides her granddaughter, of Madison, Mrs. Shapiro is survived by a daughter, Irina Shapiro Corten of Minneapolis, and one great-grandchild.         The Shapiros started their collection in 1933, purely by chance.         ''Henry and I were eating lunch at a skating rink, and the coffee spoons were chained to the water heaters on the table so they could not be stolen,'' Mrs. Shapiro said in 1992. ''The plates had inscriptions on them: 'Stolen From the Moscow State Eating Enterprise.'         ''I said, 'Well, then let's do what they invite us to do.' So we stole it.''       
         Margaret Popkin, an American lawyer who worked to overhaul the judicial system in strife-torn El Salvador, died on May 18 at a hospital in Washington. She was 54.         The cause was complications of heart surgery, her family said.         After working in California as an immigration lawyer for Central American refugees, Ms. Popkin moved to El Salvador in 1985.         There she served as deputy director of the Human Rights Institute at the University of Central America, where six Jesuit priests and two others were assassinated in 1989. Ms. Popkin traveled the country investigating human rights abuses at a time of internal warfare and corruption.         Ms. Popkin continued her work after moving back to the United States in 1993. She served as a consultant to members of United Nations commissions on El Salvador and published a book on the subject, ''Peace Without Justice: Obstacles to Building the Rule of Law in El Salvador,'' in 2000. In 1999 she became director of the Due Process of Law Foundation in Washington.         Margaret L. Popkin was born on May 21, 1950, in Iowa City. She had an undergraduate degree from the University of California, San Diego, a master's degree in women's studies from Goddard College in Vermont and a law degree from the Boalt Hall School of Law at the University of California, Berkeley.         Ms. Popkin is survived by her mother, Juliet, of Los Angeles; her son, Joel, of Silver Spring, Md.; her brother, Jeremy, of Lexington, Ky.; her sister, Susan, of Vienna, Va.; three nephews, Gabriel Popkin, Alexander Popkin and Zachary Popkin-Hall; and a niece, Rachel Kang Popkin-Hall.       
         Betty Talmadge, a former first lady of Georgia and a prominent Washington hostess who had a second career as a businesswoman, restaurateur and cookbook author after her divorce from Senator Herman E. Talmadge, died on Saturday in Atlanta. She was 81.         Mrs. Talmadge died after a long illness, her son, Gene, said.         Mrs. Talmadge was married to Mr. Talmadge, a Democrat and the scion of a powerful Georgia political family, from 1941 until their divorce in 1977. A former Georgia governor who served four terms in the United States Senate, from 1957 to 1981, Mr. Talmadge died in 2002.         In 1979, Mrs. Talmadge testified before the Senate Select Committee on Ethics against her former husband, who was accused of improperly using campaign and office money.         As Georgia's first lady in the 1940's and 50's, Mrs. Talmadge was known for her lavish parties filled with antebellum charm. At the Talmadge family plantation in Lovejoy, Ga., 25 miles south of Atlanta, partygoers might be greeted by soldiers dressed in Confederate gray, Dixieland banjo players and the family pets, among them Rabbit E. Lee and a donkey named Assley Wilkes. In the 1960's and 70's, Mrs. Talmadge was a frequent bridge partner of Lady Bird Johnson.         She also ran a prosperous country ham business and in later years operated a restaurant out of her home. She wrote two cookbooks, ''How to Cook a Pig & Other Back-to-the-Farm Recipes'' (Simon & Schuster, 1977), with Jean Robitscher and Carolyn Carter; and ''Betty Talmadge's Lovejoy Plantation Cookbook'' (Peachtree Publishers, 1983).         Leila Elizabeth Shingler was born in Ashburn, Ga., on Sept. 17, 1923, and married Mr. Talmadge at 18. In 1947, at 24, she became Georgia's first lady for 67 days after Mr. Talmadge briefly succeeded his father, Gov. Eugene Talmadge, who had died after being re-elected but before being sworn in. Herman Talmadge was later officially appointed to fill out his father's term through 1948, when he won a special election; he went on to win a full four-year term as governor in 1950.         In the early 1950's, Mrs. Talmadge and her husband started Talmadge Farms, which cured hams. She built the company into a $6 million business before selling it in 1969.         At the end of 1976, Mrs. Talmadge learned from a television news report that her husband had filed for divorce.         In 1978, she ran in the Democratic primary for the House seat in Georgia's Sixth District. She lost the primary; Newt Gingrich, a Republican, won the general election.         In the summer of 1979, Mrs. Talmadge, who said she was testifying reluctantly, told the Senate Ethics Committee about tens of thousands of dollars in cash that her former husband kept in an overcoat in the closet of their Washington condominium. Although Mrs. Talmadge did not specify how the cash got into the coat, she testified that she and her husband had dipped into it for years whenever they needed extra money. She said she used the cash to supplement the $50 weekly allowance from her millionaire husband.         In October, the Senate voted to denounce Senator Talmadge for ''reprehensible'' official finances. He lost his bid for a fifth term in 1980.         Besides her son, of Lovejoy, Mrs. Talmadge is survived by eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Another son, Robert, died in 1975.         After her first cookbook appeared, The New York Times asked Mrs. Talmadge how she had found the nerve to slaughter her first pig.         ''Real easy, honey,'' she replied. ''I just thought, 'You little male chauvinist, you,' and I went to it.''       
         Louise Westergaard O'Neil, a theatrical producer best known for the hit Broadway musical revue ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' died on May 6 in New York. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was leukemia, her family said.         Based on the music of Duke Ellington, ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' which starred Gregory Hines, Judith Jamison and Hinton Battle, opened in 1981 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and ran for nearly two years. Mr. Battle won a Tony Award, as did the costume designer, Willa Kim.         Ms. O'Neil, known professionally as Louise Westergaard, was one of several producers of ''Sophisticated Ladies.'' She was so confident of the show's chances that she even persuaded her mother's dry cleaner to become an investor.         She was also a producer, on Broadway, of ''Say Goodnight, Gracie,'' starring Frank Gorshin as George Burns, which ran for 10 months in 2002 and 2003, and of the musical revues ''Dream'' (1997) and ''Stardust'' (1987).         Ms. O'Neil's productions elsewhere included ''Tovah: Out of Her Mind,'' starring Tovah Feldshuh, at the Jewish Repertory Theater in 1996; and the musical ''Poppy,'' by Peter Nichols, staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company in London in 1982.         Louise Arnold was born in Manhattan on Sept. 2, 1937, and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago. She was later artistic director of Theater of the Open Eye, a New York-based company founded by the choreographer Jean Erdman and her husband, the mythologist Joseph Campbell.         Ms. O'Neil's first marriage, to John Westergaard, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Stephen O'Neil, whom she married in 1989; two sons and two daughters from her first marriage, Emile, Kermit, Cathrine and Elizabeth; and three grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth McFarland Hoffman, who as poetry editor of Ladies' Home Journal sandwiched the work of W.H. Auden, Adrienne Rich and Sylvia Plath in between ''Is Your Marriage a Masquerade?'' and ''Bing Crosby's Kitchen for His Bride,'' died last Thursday in Philadelphia. She was 83 and had homes in Swarthmore, Pa., and Harborside, Me.         The cause was complications after cardiac surgery, her husband, Daniel Hoffman, said.         While Ms. Hoffman was at Ladies' Home Journal, from 1948 to 1962, the magazine published at least a half-dozen poems in each monthly issue. Major 20th-century writers whose verse appeared there included Marianne Moore, John Ciardi, Mark Van Doren, Randall Jarrell, Maxine Kumin, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Walter de la Mare, Galway Kinnell, Maxwell Anderson and John Updike.         Ms. Hoffman's own poems, published under her maiden name, also appeared in the magazine. She left Ladies' Home Journal in 1962, after its new owners stopped publishing poetry.         Elizabeth McFarland was born on May 3, 1922, in Harrisburg, Pa. As a teenager, she won a national poetry contest sponsored by Scholastic magazine; she later became Scholastic's poetry editor.         In 1948, she married Mr. Hoffman. He survives her, as do a son, MacFarlane Hoffman of Swarthmore; a daughter, Kate H. Siddiqi of Philadelphia; and two sisters, Nancy Ranew of Milton, Fla.; and Janice Volz of New York City.         The poems in Ladies' Home Journal were generally short, but Ms. Hoffman paid top rates: $10 a line. (In contrast, Poetry magazine paid 50 cents a line in the early 1950's, Mr. Hoffman, a prominent poet, said.)         Usually set in a box in the middle of a page, the poems created some arresting juxtapositions. In the August 1950 issue, ''Secrets,'' by Auden, follows an ad for Velveeta. In September 1956, ''Where the Bodies Break,'' by Mr. Kinnell, shares a page with ''How to Make 10 Tantalizing Butter Waffles With That Tender Melt-Away Texture.''         Readers of the June 1953 issue, which featured ''A Glass of Summer Daisies,'' by Jessamyn West, could, a page later, contemplate the question, ''Did you wake up today with 'morning mouth'?''         The magazine had a history of such juxtapositions. Under Edward Bok, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer who edited Ladies' Home Journal from 1889 to 1919, it published fiction by Sarah Orne Jewett, Bret Harte and Rudyard Kipling alongside articles on childrearing, Jennifer Scanlon, the author of ''Inarticulate Longings: The Ladies' Home Journal, Gender, and the Promises of Consumer Culture'' (Routledge, 1995), said in a telephone interview yesterday.         In the 1950's, women's magazines were tantalizing readers with similar mixed signals. ''The message of the Ladies' Home Journal and magazines like that is, 'Hey, we're willing to acknowledge the choices that women have in life, but in the end, we will maintain that most women will choose home and family,''' Professor Scanlon, a historian at Bowdoin College, said. ''The magazines reveal the tensions, as well as the message, of conformity.''       
         Anne Bancroft, the stage and film star whose signature triumphs in a 50-year career ranged from the courageous Annie Sullivan in ''The Miracle Worker'' to the hungrily seductive Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate,'' died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and Los Angeles. The cause was uterine cancer, said John Barlow, a spokesman for Ms. Bancroft's husband, Mel Brooks.         Graced with a sultry voice and expressive mouth, Ms. Bancroft could appear both tough and vulnerable, and she eagerly sought out nearly every kind of role, maturing effortlessly over the decades. She lent a singular potency to parts as varied as Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' and the mother superior of a convent, and from an aging ballerina to Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel. She repeatedly won praise for her work, as well as an Academy Award and two Tonys.         Arthur Penn, who directed her award-winning Broadway performances in ''Two for the Seesaw'' and ''The Miracle Worker,'' both by William Gibson, put it this way: ''More happens in her face in 10 seconds than happens in most women's faces in 10 years.'' Broadway lights were scheduled to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Ms. Bancroft worked hard to get beneath the surface, to inhabit a role as deeply as possible. While rehearsing for her role as the young Helen Keller's teacher in ''The Miracle Worker,'' she put tape over her eyes better to understand what it was like to be blind, learned sign language and spent time at a home for the visually impaired. Preparing for ''Golda,'' she traveled to Israel and got to know and observe Meir. She was more interested in performance than theory, although she was a member of the Actors Studio early in her career. The actor Rod Steiger once gave her a copy of Stanislavsky's writings on acting. ''I still have it,'' she said some years later, ''but I've never read it.''         The landmarks in Ms. Bancroft's acting life were, unquestionably, the two Gibson plays and ''The Graduate.'' She had already accumulated a long list of credits in TV dramas when she moved to Hollywood in the early 1950's to join the crowd of young hopefuls jostling for jobs in second- or third-rate films. She was among the few who found steady work, appearing in more than a dozen grade-C features with titles like ''Treasure of the Golden Condor,'' ''Gorilla at Large'' -- ''I played the title role'' -- and ''Demetrius and the Gladiators.'' Disenchanted after five years or so, and newly divorced, she headed back to New York with the promise of an audition for a new Broadway play called ''Two for the Seesaw.''         It was a two-character play, with Henry Fonda starring as a depressed Midwestern lawyer with marital troubles who comes to New York and meets Gittel Mosca, an attractive, thoroughly quirky young bohemian girl from the Bronx. They are two lost souls who, though their life styles are worlds apart, manage to help one another. Ms. Bancroft, who happened to be not only attractive and quirky but also Bronx-born and raised, auditioned and got the job. After a rocky start -- she had virtually no stage experience -- she quickly settled into the role. When the play opened in 1958, Ms. Bancroft stole the show and ultimately won a Tony Award as best supporting actress.         When the next Gibson-Penn theater project took shape the following year -- the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan -- they knew who would play Sullivan from Day 1. The part of the hostile, 10-year-old Helen went to Patty Duke. Between them, Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke tore up the stage as Sullivan struggled to communicate with and calm her raging young charge, eventually breaking through the child's defensive shell. ''The Miracle Worker'' was a resounding hit, and Ms. Bancroft came away with her second Tony Award, this time as best actress. Tonys also went to Mr. Penn, Mr. Gibson and the play's producer, Fred Coe. Two years, two plays, two Tonys. And when ''The Miracle Worker'' was made into a film in 1962, both Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke won Academy Awards.         Hollywood now had a new star, and Ms. Bancroft was offered scripts rather better than, say, ''Gorilla at Large.'' She appeared with Peter Finch in ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1964), Harold Pinter's adaptation of a novel by Penelope Mortimer about a woman driven into a nervous breakdown by her husband's casual philandering. Her work brought her an Oscar nomination. Next came ''The Slender Thread'' (1965), in which she played a housewife whose crumbling marriage leads her to attempt suicide.         By the time ''The Graduate'' came along, she was more than ready to play the alpha female and she got her wish with the character of Mrs. Robinson, the bored predator whose sexual binges with young Benjamin Braddock, the son of her husband's law partner are mechanical but necessary props for her self-indulgent ego. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a melancholic soundtrack of songs by Simon and Garfunkel, ''The Graduate'' was hailed as a winning social satire. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called it ''devastating and uproarious'' and hailed Ms. Bancroft's ''sullenly contemptuous and voracious performance.'' Mr. Nichols won an Oscar, while nominations went to Ms. Bancroft, Mr. Hoffman and Katharine Ross, who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The still photograph that appeared in advertisements for the film, showing Mrs. Robinson slowly peeling off a nylon stocking under the glazed gaze of Mr. Hoffman's Benjamin, became a classic of its kind.         Anna Maria Louisa Italiano was born on Sept. 17, 1931, in the Bronx to Italian immigrant parents. Her father, Michael, was a patternmaker, and her mother, Mildred, a telephone operator. By the time she was 2 years old she was learning to sing and dance. ''Why play with dolls,'' she recalled years later, ''when you can sing 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' on the street corner?'' Even so, by the time she left high school she had decided to become a laboratory technician. Instead, her mother insisted that she attend the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Two years later she found work in television where, as Anne Marno, she appeared in scores of dramatic shows. In 1951 she was asked to participate in another actor's screen test for 20th Century Fox, after which she, not he, was offered the contract that took her to Hollywood. At the studio she was handed a book of names and urged to choose a new one. She became Anne Bancroft. She had no illusions about that chapter of her film career, noting some years later that ''20th Century Fox told me what to do and I did it. I learned nothing.''         During her first stay in Hollywood she married Martin A. May, a building contractor, in 1954. They were divorced in 1957. In 1964 she married Mr. Brooks, who survives her, as does their son, Maximilian. Also surviving are her mother and two sisters, Joanne and Phyllis.         In the 1970's and 80's Ms. Bancroft took on a variety of roles, from Winston Churchill's American-born mother in ''Young Winston'' to the actress-wife of a hammy Polish impresario (''world famous in Poland''), played by Mr. Brooks, in the farcical ''To Be or Not to Be.'' She also earned two more Oscar nominations, one for her portrayal of a ballerina confronting her choice of career over family in ''The Turning Point,'' the other for her work as a mother superior in ''Agnes of God.'' Other major roles included '''Night Mother,'' as a woman struggling with her daughter's decision to commit suicide, and ''84 Charing Cross Road,'' in which she played an American writer whose correspondence with a London bookseller (Anthony Hopkins) develops into a long-distance romance.         She rarely returned to the theater, although she did win praise as the steel-willed Regina Giddens in Mr. Nichols's 1967 staging of Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In The Times, Clive Barnes characterized her performance as ''a series of unforgettable visual and aural images.'' The following year Ms. Bancroft appeared in the Lincoln Center Repertory production of another William Gibson drama, ''A Cry of Players,'' set in Shakespearean England. Her performance in ''Golda'' (1977) brought her a Tony nomination. She played a crippled violinist the 1981 ''Duet for One,'' which closed after a two-week run, and then was absent from the stage until the spring of 2002, when she was set to star in Edward Albee's ''Occupant'' as the sculptor Louise Nevelson. The play's scheduled run had to be canceled when Ms. Bancroft contracted pneumonia during previews.         In later years she continued to appear in films, although the roles grew smaller. She was briefly on screen as Nicolas Cage's mother in ''Honeymoon in Vegas,'' trained a young woman as an assassin in ''Point of No Return,'' scored a few points as a wily Senator in ''G.I. Jane'' and had some campy fun in an updated version of ''Great Expectations'' as a loony character based on Dickens's Miss Havisham.         She fared better in television, earning Emmy nominations playing a killer in the PBS drama ''Mrs. Cage'' and the title role in ''Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' on CBS.         She was resigned to the fact that age and changing times worked against her. In a 1992 interview in The Times she admitted to taking parts ''even if they're one page,'' because ''there are very few good scripts, even for Julia Roberts.'' She preferred a good bit part to a heftier bad one. She often rejected work in favor of family life -- for a while. ''I retire after every project,'' she once said. ''Then somehow there's always something that pulls me out of retirement.''         Correction:  June 18, 2005, Saturday  The obituary of the actress Anne Bancroft on June 8 misstated the name of the acting school she attended and omitted a major award. The school was the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, not the New York Academy. Ms. Bancroft won an Emmy in 1999 for best supporting actress in a mini-series, for the CBS drama ''Deep in My Heart.''       
         Annie Toglia, who developed a physical rehabilitation program for women with breast cancer, died in Mount Kisco, N.Y. on Wednesday. She was 56.         Her family said the cause was complications of the disease.         When Ms. Toglia learned she had late-stage breast cancer in 1996, she had a private practice in sports medicine fitness training. After undergoing several operations, aggressive treatment and years of physical therapy, she left her practice to become a medical exercise specialist and advocate for breast cancer awareness.         She developed a special exercise program to help survivors recover and maintain their health after surgery.         She wrote ''Staying Abreast: Rehabilitation Exercises for Breast Cancer Surgery,'' a guide that is available on her Web site, www.stayingabreast.com.         Ann Theresa Toglia was born on June 18, 1948, in Mount Vernon, N.Y. She earned a bachelor's degree in English in 1970 from the State University of New York, Purchase. She had formal training in ballet and modern dance and earned many certifications in health and fitness instruction. She received a second bachelor's degree, in music, from Marymount Manhattan College in New York City in 1995.         Ms. Toglia is survived by her parents, Orazio and Rose Toglia, both of Mount Vernon, N.Y.       
         Lillian Lux, the matriarch of a celebrated Yiddish theatrical family who performed for decades as an actress and singer in New York and around the world, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her son, Mike Burstyn, said.         With her husband, Pesach Burstein, Ms. Lux starred inYiddish-language plays and musicals from the 1930's on. Among her most famous roles was Feygele in the operetta ''A Khasene in Shtetl'' (''A Village Wedding''), which she played opposite her husband. In later years, the couple performed with their two children as the Four Bursteins.         The family was the subject of a documentary, ''The Komediant,'' shown in the United States in 2002. Directed by Arnon Goldfinger, an Israeli filmmaker, the film is narrated by Ms. Lux.         The first decades of the 20th century were the glory days of the Yiddish stage, with more than a dozen theaters in New York City alone. To their devoted fans, who packed the seats for original productions and adaptations of the classics, Ms. Lux and Mr. Burstein were the Lunt and Fontanne of the Lower East Side.         In the late 1940's Ms. Lux had her own Yiddish-language radio show on WEVD-AM. But by the 1950's, with theatergoers graying and many American Jews assimilating, Yiddish theater began to disappear. By the 1970's, it was almost completely gone. ''The Komediant'' chronicles the family's peripatetic existence as they travel to Europe, South America and Israel in pursuit of an ever more elusive audience.         Lillian Sylvia Lukashefsky was born in Brooklyn on June 20, 1918; her family Americanized its surname when she was young. She began her stage training as a child with the Yiddish Art Theater, run by the impresario Maurice Schwartz. As a teenager, she played the Catskills, performing opposite Danny Kaye.         At 17 Ms. Lux met Mr. Burstein, more than 20 years her senior and an established star. He was looking for an actress for his South American tour. After making the requisite good impression on Ms. Lux's parents, he hired her. They set sail and were married in Uruguay in 1938.         In the late 1930's, the couple toured Poland, catching the last ship out before the Nazis invaded in September 1939. After the war, they returned to Europe. Little of their audience remained. In the 1950's, the Bursteins went to Israel but found it difficult for Yiddish theater to take root there. They had better success a decade later, when they returned with ''The Megilla of Itzik Manger.'' The show, a musical version of the Book of Esther starring Ms. Lux, her husband and son, came to Broadway in a Yiddish-English production in 1968.         After her husband's death in 1986, Ms. Lux performed in a one-woman show and appeared often on radio.         Besides her son, of Los Angeles (an actor on Broadway and in films, Mr. Burstyn changed the spelling of his name as an adult), Ms. Lux is survived by a daughter, Susan Roth of Westfield, N.J.; and a sister, Beatrice Friedman of Washington.       
         Shana Alexander, a journalist and television personality best known as the liberal sparring partner of the conservative commentator James J. Kilpatrick on the television newsmagazine ''60 Minutes'' in the 1970's, died on Thursday in Hermosa Beach, Calif. She was 79 and had lived in Manhattan and Wainscott, N.Y., for many years.         The cause was cancer, her family said. She had been in an assisted living facility.         A former columnist for Newsweek and Life magazines, Ms. Alexander joined ''60 Minutes'' in 1975 as the liberal voice of its debate segment, ''Point/Counterpoint.'' Once a week for nearly five years, she and Mr. Kilpatrick, a columnist for The Washington Star, locked horns over some of the most divisive issues of the day, including drugs, women's liberation and the Vietnam War. ''60 Minutes'' dropped the segment in 1979.         Ms. Alexander also wrote several nonfiction books, including ''Anyone's Daughter'' (Viking, 1979), about Patty Hearst; ''Very Much a Lady: The Untold Story of Jean Harris and Dr. Herman Tarnower'' (Little, Brown, 1983); and ''When She Was Bad'' (Random House, 1990), about the Bess Myerson conspiracy trial.         In 1995, she published a memoir, ''Happy Days: My Mother, My Father, My Sister and Me'' (Doubleday), an account of her privileged but loveless childhood.         Shana Ager was born in Manhattan on Oct., 6, 1925. Her father, Milton Ager, was a successful Tin Pan Alley composer whose tunes included ''Ain't She Sweet'' and ''Happy Days Are Here Again,'' which became a Democratic Party anthem. Ms. Alexander's mother, Cecelia, was a film critic for Variety and the New York newspaper PM.         Shana and her younger sister spent their early childhood in the family's opulent home on West 57th Street. In later years, the family lived in a string of elegant hotels. Her parents numbered Irving Berlin, the Gershwin brothers and the Marx Brothers among their friends.         Ms. Alexander earned a bachelor's degree in anthropology from Vassar in 1945. While in college, she worked as a copy girl for PM and after graduating became a reporter there; her first assignment was to interview the stripper Gypsy Rose Lee. Ms. Alexander was later an entertainment editor at Flair magazine.         In 1951, Ms. Alexander was the first woman to be named a staff writer of Life. She wrote a regular column, The Feminine Eye, for the magazine from 1964 to 1969. From 1969 to 1971, she was the editor of McCall's magazine, the first woman in nearly half a century to hold the job.         Ms. Alexander joined ''60 Minutes'' on Jan. 5, 1975, replacing the journalist Nicholas von Hoffman. Though she and Mr. Kilpatrick were friends off camera, their on-camera arguments were so famously heated, and so exquisitely literate, that they were regularly parodied by ''Saturday Night Live'' in its mock newscast, ''Weekend Update.''         Playing a character modeled on Ms. Alexander, Jane Curtin would begin the segment with a stream of impassioned statements. Dan Aykroyd, as Mr. Kilpatrick's alter ego, would invariably retort, ''Jane, you ignorant slut.'' She would shoot back, ''Dan, you pompous ass.''         In the years after ''60 Minutes,'' Ms. Alexander turned to writing accounts of true crime, which often opened windows onto larger issues like sex roles and social class and, in some cases, onto Ms. Alexander's own life. In most of her books, the central figures were women whose lives of privilege had caused them little but sorrow.         Many reviewers praised Ms. Alexander's strong characterizations, eye for detail and ability to capture entire social milieus. But some critics took her to task for identifying with her subjects too strongly. Her biography of Jean S. Harris, convicted in 1981 in the shooting death of her lover, the diet doctor Herman Tarnower, is an impassioned portrait of Ms. Harris as the victim of a domineering man. Ms. Alexander later publicly supported clemency for Ms. Harris. (Ms. Harris's sentence was commuted in December 1992.)         If Ms. Alexander felt a kinship with her subjects, she had good reason: she too was reared in icy splendor, by a remote, glamorous mother. Reviewing her memoir, ''Happy Days,'' in The New York Times Book Review, Delia Ephron called it ''heartbreaking,'' adding: ''There is no physical cruelty in this tale, just the awesome power of withheld love.''         Ms. Alexander's two marriages ended in divorce. Her only child, Kathy, died in 1987 at the age of 25 in a fall from Ms. Alexander's Park Avenue apartment building, an apparent suicide. Ms. Alexander's sister, Laurel Bentley of Manhattan Beach, Calif., is her only immediate survivor.         Among Ms. Alexander's other books are ''Nutcracker: Money, Madness, Murder'' (Doubleday, 1985); ''The Pizza Connection: Lawyers, Money, Drugs, Mafia'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1988); ''Marking Time: Letters From Jean Harris to Shana Alexander'' (Scribner, 1991); and ''The Astonishing Elephant'' (Random House, 2000).         Though Ms. Alexander always considered herself a print journalist, it was her gleeful, if carefully scripted, battles with Mr. Kilpatrick that made her famous. ''Imagine having to explain the facts of life to Jack Kilpatrick on national TV,'' Ms. Alexander said in a 1976 segment on maternity leave.         And from Mr. Kilpatrick, in a 1977 broadcast: ''If ever I heard an oversimplified fairy tale of the last years in Vietnam, I just heard one from you.''         Their act, Ms. Alexander knew, had a time-honored antecedent. ''Unwittingly,'' she told Publishers Weekly in 1979, ''we have reinvented an ancient classical art form known as the 'Punch and Judy Show.'''       
         Vera Komarkova, a botanist and mountain climber who was among the first women to scale some of the world's highest peaks, died on May 25 in her home in Leysin, Switzerland. She was 62.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, her family said.         In the fall of 1978 the American Women's Himalayan Expedition left the United States for Annapurna in Nepal, the 10th highest mountain in the world. Dr. Komarkova and her climbing partner Irene Miller, now Beardsley, with the help of two Sherpa guides, became the first women and the first Americans to reach the summit.         ''She was an incredibly strong, dedicated climber,'' said Arlene Blum, who led the 10-woman expedition. ''Vera was one of the strongest on our team.''         At the time, it was only the fourth expedition to reach the top, and Annapurna is now thought to be one of the most dangerous of the world's 8,000-meter mountains, a class that includes Everest. Two other members of the team fell to their deaths in the attempt.         It was then generally believed that women were not physically and emotionally strong enough to endure such demanding climbs, and women had problems getting climbing permits or joining men's teams, Ms. Blum and Ms. Beardsley said.         Most of the roughly $80,000 needed for their trip was raised by a T-shirt campaign with the slogan ''A Woman's Place Is on Top.''         In 1984, Dr. Komarkova led another successful Himalayan expedition, to Cho Oyu in Tibet, the world's sixth highest peak. She and her partner were the first women to reach that summit, and it was her last major climb.         Vera Komarkova was born in Pisek, Czechoslovakia, in 1942. Her father was a scientist at Charles University in Prague, where she would earn a master's degree in biology and chemistry in 1964. Throughout her youth, she climbed in Europe, scaling mountains in the Tatras, Carparthians, and the Alps.         Dr. Komarkova studied at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and earned a Ph.D. in biology in 1976. She later became an American citizen.         For her dissertation, Dr. Komarkova produced a detailed study of the alpine flora of the Niwot Range in the Colorado Rockies.         It was published as a two-volume book, ''Alpine Vegetation of the Indian Peaks Area'' (Cramer, Vaduz; 1979), and remains the definitive work on the subject, according to her adviser, Patrick Webber, now of Michigan State University.         She stayed with the university's Institute of Arctic and Alpine Research for several years, climbing the tallest North American mountains and meeting many of the women she would later join on the Himalayan expeditions.         In 1986, Dr. Komarkova moved back to Europe to join the staff of the American College of Switzerland, a campus of Schiller International University, at Leysin. She was a professor of science, primarily alpine ecology, and later a professor of information technology.         She is survived by her mother, Tatiana Ruzickova of Pisek, the Czech Republic; and two sons, Mipam Moudry of Bossonnens, Switzerland, and Dorje Moudry of Leysin.       
         Grete Sultan, a pianist and teacher who was both a performer of Bach and Schubert and a mentor to John Cage and his contemporaries, died in her sleep at St. Vincent's Hospital last Sunday morning. She was 99.         ''Basically, her heart gave out,'' said Robert Jurgrau, a former student and close friend. She had been hospitalized for about a week with pneumonia.         Ms. Sultan was a matter-of-fact proponent of the avant-garde. Her calling cards included Bach's Goldberg Variations, which she performed with all the repeats in downtown New York and, later, in uptown concert halls -- which, in the 1940's, before Glenn Gould's 1955 recording helped make the piece familiar fare, was practically outré.         But Ms. Sultan was open to all kinds of music. She met Cage in 1945; his ''Études Australes'' from the mid-1970's, based on notes derived from star charts, were written for her. Other contemporary composers whose works she performed included Earle Brown, Stefan Wolpe, Alan Hovhaness, Ben Weber and Christian Wolff, one of her students.         She said in a 1996 interview: ''Music is music. That's all.''         Johanna Margarete Sultan was born on June 21, 1906, in Berlin. Her family was musical -- two of her aunts had studied with Clara Schumann -- and Richard Strauss, Artur Schnabel, and Ferruccio Busoni were regular visitors to her childhood home. So was the American pianist Richard Buhlig, who introduced her to the composer Henry Cowell and the music of other contemporary composers. At the Hochschule für Musik in Berlin, she completed a course of study in only three years, working with Leonid Kreutzer. But a more important mentor was the pianist and conductor Edwin Fischer, teacher of Alfred Brendel, Paul Badura-Skoda and Daniel Barenboim, with whom she began private lessons after graduation.         Her burgeoning concert career was, however, abruptly curtailed by Hitler's rise to power, after which Jewish pianists could no longer play German music, although Arturo Toscanini set up some recitals for her in Italy. In 1941, Buhlig helped her escape to the United States, where she arrived with a suitcase and the clothes on her back. (Her mother was able to join her in 1946; a sister also managed to escape.)         Ms. Sultan began teaching at Vassar College and at the 92nd Street Y in New York before taking a post at the Masters' School in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y., in 1952, which she held until 1971. It was Buhlig who introduced her to his former student Cage; Ms. Sultan, in turn, introduced Cage to her student Mr. Wolff, who gave Cage his first copy of the I Ching. In addition to Mr. Wolff, her students included the composer Lucia Dlugoszewskiwho moved to New York to study Bach with her in 1948 and ended up meeting the choreographer Erick Hawkins, who had a studio next door.         Ms. Sultan also continued to perform in concert throughout her life, winning praise for her natural, unflashy manner and musical integrity, and doggedly following her own musical tastes through the years, performing now Schubert, now Schoenberg, now Stravinsky, now Cage or Feldman without proselytizing and with equal aplomb. In 1996, shortly after her 90th birthday, she played the Goldberg Variations at Merkin Hall. The same year brought the release of the first of two retrospective CD sets that give a flavor of her performances and the breadth of her repertory.         ''She clearly strives for something higher from music than emotion or adventure,'' wrote Mark Swed, the Los Angeles Times music critic, after that 1996 concert. ''Her Bach has the modernist's attention paid to the smallest detail of sound and structure. The feeling here is that the spirit will soar much higher if it isn't pushed.''         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, an educator who concluded that bored high school students should be sent straight to college and started Simon's Rock College to prove the point, died on Monday in Canaan, Conn. She was 95.         Her death was announced by Judith Monachina, spokeswoman for the college, in Great Barrington, Mass., which is now part of Bard College. Mrs. Hall, as the headmistress of a girls' prep school, perceived that adolescents were maturing faster than in the past, and that high schools were not meeting the challenge. So in 1964, she began what she called ''an early college'' for young women. Students who otherwise would have been in the last two years of high school instead took the first two years of college.         Leon Botstein, president of Bard, explained in an interview that Mrs. Hall abhorred the way adolescents were ''infantilized,'' when they were capable of doing high-level academic work. He said that her ideas had been adopted by more and more colleges, and that Bard itself had intensified its ''early-college'' efforts by beginning a high school in New York City in 2001 to teach college-level courses.         The later Bard program received funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has also given millions to other early college programs on the theory they will help reduce dropout rates. Tom Vander Ark, executive director of the foundation's education program, credited Mrs. Hall's inspiration.         Mrs. Hall's mission was intensely personal. In addition to spending more than $6 million of her own, she gave 200 acres of her family's farmland, buildings included, to start the college, which became coeducational in 1970. She named it for a rock on which she had played as a child.         Elizabeth Blodgett was born in Manhattan on Nov. 16, 1909. Her father made a fortune in the chewing gum industry.         She later attended public and private schools in the Great Barrington area. She graduated from Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield, Mass., in 1928, and then attended Knox College for a year.         In 1930, she married Livingston Hall, who was later a professor and administrator at Harvard Law School. After having four children, she entered Radcliffe College, one of the first adults to do so, and graduated in 1946.         After holding several other jobs, she became head of the history department, then headmistress, at the Concord Academy, a private girls' school in Concord, Mass. An article in Mademoiselle in 1969 said she turned ''a genteel finishing school'' into ''one of the most dynamic girls' preparatory schools in the East.''         It was a time when educators were scrambling to jump-start education to keep up with the Russians, in space and elsewhere. Initiatives ranged from Advanced Placement courses that allowed students to do college-credit work while still in high school to the experimental admissions of bright high school students.         Earlier, in the 1930's, Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago and a philosopher of education, had admitted academically superior 16-year-olds as freshmen. European universities had long allowed such acceleration.         What Mrs. Hall was doing was different in that she established a residential college expressly for high school aged students, putting it somewhere between a prep school and a college, with resultant tensions. For example, students complained about rules forbidding overnight room visits by members of the opposite sex.         There have been accusations over the years between the students and the administration as the college sought to find ways to restrict students' behavior without being harsh.         Mrs. Hall faced frequent criticism from both faculty and students. In an interview with Berkshire Week in 1988, she recalled that she fought against ''self-pity'' before resigning, partly as a result of such criticism, in 1972 . She remained a trustee.         Mrs. Hall's husband died in 1995. She is survived by her sons, Thomas Livingston Hall of San Francisco, and John Kendrick Hall of Jerusalem; her daughters, Margaret Hall Whitfield Courant of Great Barrington and Elizabeth Hall Richardson of Denver; 11 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.         Correction:  July 21, 2005, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, who founded Simon's Rock College, now part of Bard College, referred incorrectly in some copies to the given name of the president of Bard, who commented on her legacy. He is Leon Botstein, not Leo.       
         Dame Cicely Saunders, a founder of the modern hospice movement, died July 14 in the prototype she had built in Britain 38 years ago, St. Christopher's in Sydenham, south London. She was 87.         Her death was reported on the hospice's Web site.         European hospices go back to the Middle Ages, when they sheltered, comforted and entertained wayfarers -- pilgrims, minstrels, crusading knights. Dame Cicely, a medical doctor, played a major role in reinventing them as last way stations for the terminally ill, offering palliative care and, if possible, peace of mind before a death without needless pain.         She founded the hospice at St. Christopher's in 1967 and made it the kernel of a movement that she helped spread in the United States and worldwide. Its purpose was to complement pain and symptom control with compassionate care.         Now caring for more than 2,000 patients and their families a year, St. Christopher's has inspired about 240 other hospices in Britain alone and many others around the world. It supports hospice care in developing countries and shares expertise through international partnerships and extensive education, training and research programs. Over the years it has trained some 50,000 doctors, nurses and other professionals and helped establish palliative care for those with terminal illnesses as a medical discipline.         Dame Cicely was St. Christopher's medical director from its founding in 1967 until 1985, then served as chairwoman till 2000, when she took the title of president.         Her travels in the United States greatly encouraged the movement here, said Patricia Farrington, director of the Pax Christi Hospice program at St. Vincent Catholic Medical Centers in New York.         ''She came to us in the early 60's and met with people here who became hospice founders and pioneers,'' she said. ''She came to New York, Los Angeles and Boston and Yale, and met with people who had corresponded with her and were impressed with her passion, that it was the obligation of health-care providers to relieve suffering.''         Dame Cicely's first book, ''Care of the Dying,'' was published in 1960. She wrote and edited textbooks and guides for laymen bracing for a death in the family. Among the titles were ''Living with Dying'' (1983) ; ''Management of Terminal Malignant Disease'' (Oxford, third edition, 1993), written with Nigel Sykes; and ''Living With Dying: A Guide to Palliative Care'' (third edition, 1995), to which she contributed.         She received more than a score of honorary degrees and was made a Dame Commander of the British Empire in 1980. She was awarded Britain's Order of Merit in 1989.         Cicely Mary Strode Saunders was born into a well-to-do family on June 22, 1918, in Barnet, in north London. She set out to study politics, philosophy and economics at Oxford, but with the war she turned to tending to the ill and wounded. She graduated as a Red Cross war nurse from the Nightingale Training School in 1944 and worked in many hospital departments.         Returning to St. Anne's College at Oxford, she studied to become a medical social worker, or what the British then called a lady almoner. She trained at a cancer hospital and, having joined the staff, developed a rapport with patients. Talking with them, she saw the need for better-rounded care of those near the end.         She entered St. Thomas's Hospital Medical School, became a doctor in 1957 and, as a researcher in pharmacology, worked on handling pain. She sought a way to avoid large dosages of medications like morphine by giving low dosages regularly, allowing the patient to stay alert.         As early as 1959 she presented her ideas for a holistic hospice in a paper titled ''The Need'' that drew contrasts with prevailing treatments of the terminally ill. In another paper, ''The Scheme,'' she outlined a plan for a 100-bed home.         Dame Cicely, a Christian, included a chapel and provided for prayer time but made it clear that religion, even when proffered tactfully, was no substitute for clean, well-lighted rooms, a comfortable day room, a homelike setting and a caring staff.         The home within a hospital that she had envisioned, St. Christopher's Hospice, finally opened in 1967 after she led a fund-raising campaign for it.         ''I didn't set out to change the world, I set out to do something about pain,'' Dame Cicely said in a 2002 interview with The Daily Telegraph of London. ''It wasn't long before I realized that pain wasn't only physical, but it was psychological and spiritual.''         In 1980, Dame Cicely married Marian Bohusz-Szyszko, a Polish artist. He died in her care at St. Christopher's in 1995.       
         Elizabeth C. Beine, a retired director of New York City's Bureau of Child Welfare, who for more than a decade oversaw one of the largest child welfare programs in the world, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96.         Susan Vail, a longtime friend, confirmed the death.         Ms. Beine (pronounced BYE-nee) was the director of the bureau, then part of the city's Department of Welfare, from 1962 to 1975. The bureau provided a range of services, including counseling, temporary shelter and long-term foster care.         The bureau became Special Services for Children in 1974 and the Child Welfare Administration in 1989. In 1996 the city established the Administration for Children's Services as a separate agency.         During Ms. Beine's tenure the bureau started the city's first protective-services program, which allowed needy children to receive help at home rather than being sent to foster care. The bureau also instituted the city's first family day care programs, which provided child care at home instead of in an institution.         Elizabeth Charlene Beine was born in Manhattan on July 4, 1909; her mother was a social worker with the New York Mission Society. Ms. Beine earned an undergraduate degree from Hunter College and, in 1949, a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work.         In 1950 Ms. Beine joined the Welfare Department, where she eventually supervised the city's three children's shelters. After retiring as bureau director in 1975, she became an executive with the Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies.         Ms. Beine is survived by a sister, Deanie Alexander of Manhattan.       
         Barbara Bel Geddes, a critically acclaimed stage, screen and television actress known for her work with Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950's and, more recently, for her role as Miss Ellie, the matriarch of the fractious Ewing clan on the long-running nighttime soap opera ''Dallas,'' died on Monday at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 82.         The Jordan-Fernald Funeral Home in Mount Desert, Me., confirmed the death to The Associated Press, giving no cause. The San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday that Ms. Bel Geddes had died of lung cancer.         On Broadway Ms. Bel Geddes was best known as the original Maggie the Cat in Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on Hot Tin Roof,'' which opened in 1955. She also appeared in ''The Moon Is Blue'' (1951) and ''Silent Night, Lonely Night'' (1959). Her film credits include Hitchcock's ''Vertigo'' (1958); ''Caught'' (1949), directed by Max Ophüls; and ''Panic in the Streets'' (1950), directed by Elia Kazan.         On television Ms. Bel Geddes starred in several episodes of Hitchcock's weekly series ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' during the late 1950's and early 1960's. In 1980 she won the Emmy Award for best actress in a dramatic series for her role on ''Dallas.''         Blond, soft-spoken and slightly plump as a young woman, Ms. Bel Geddes projected a resolute, even steely, intelligence beneath her cherubic exterior. It was a quality Hitchcock used to great effect, notably in ''Vertigo,'' in which Ms. Bel Geddes played Midge, the steadfast, unglamorous ex-fiancée of Jimmy Stewart, who watches his painful descent into obsession and madness.         Hitchcock used her memorably again in ''Lamb to the Slaughter,'' widely considered one of the finest episodes of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' Broadcast in the spring of 1958, it starred Ms. Bel Geddes as a wife who murders her philandering husband by bludgeoning him with a frozen leg of lamb. When detectives show up to investigate the death, the murder weapon is nowhere to be found. Ms. Bel Geddes, smiling a tiny, knowing smile, sits them down to a home-cooked meal.         Barbara Bel Geddes was born in New York on Oct. 31, 1922. Her father was Norman Bel Geddes, the architect and stage designer. She made her Broadway debut in 1941 in the forgettable play ''Out of the Frying Pan.'' She went on to win a Theater World Award in 1946 for her performance in ''Deep Are the Roots,'' which Kazan directed.         Soon afterward, Ms. Bel Geddes went to Hollywood, where she starred opposite Henry Fonda in her first film, ''The Long Night'' (1947). Although she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Katrin Hanson, the daughter of Norwegian immigrants in ''I Remember Mama'' (1948), Ms. Bel Geddes made relatively few movies, working primarily in theater and television. Her other film credits include ''Blood on the Moon'' (1948), ''Fourteen Hours'' (1951) and ''The Five Pennies'' (1959).         Ms. Bel Geddes's greatest critical acclaim came as Maggie, the restless young wife in a decaying family of Mississippi planters in ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' Reviewing her performance in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called it ''vital, lovely and frank.''         Her other Broadway credits include ''The Living Room'' (1954), by Graham Greene; ''The Sleeping Prince'' (1956), by Terence Rattigan; and ''Mary, Mary'' (1961), by Jean Kerr.         Ms. Bel Geddes appeared on ''Dallas'' in two installments, the first from 1978 to 1984, when she retired after heart surgery. She was replaced as Miss Ellie by Donna Reed, who sued to retain the role after the show's producers reinstated Ms. Bel Geddes in 1985. Ms. Reed lost her bid, and Ms. Bel Geddes remained in the role until 2000.         Ms. Bel Geddes's first marriage, to Carl Schreuer, an engineer, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Windsor Lewis, a theater director, died before her. She is survived by a daughter, Susan, from her first marriage, and a daughter, Betsy, from her second.         In addition to acting, Ms. Bel Geddes also worked as a professional artist. She wrote and illustrated two children's books, ''I Like to Be Me'' (Viking, 1963) and ''So Do I'' (Arbor House, 1972).         Looking back on her career, Ms. Bel Geddes expressed amusement that she was so often cast as patricians. ''They're always making me play well-bred ladies,'' she told People magazine in 1982. She added, ''I'm not very well bred, and I'm not much of a lady.''         Correction:  August 13, 2005, Saturday  An obituary of the actress Barbara Bel Geddes on Thursday misstated the year of her final appearance on the television show ''Dallas.'' It was 1990, not 2000. A picture caption referred incorrectly to the character she played. It was Miss Ellie, not Ms. Ellie.       
         Judith Rossner, a novelist who used crisp, piercing prose to tell of women pushed to often grotesque extremes, most famously in her 1975 book ''Looking for Mr. Goodbar,'' died on Tuesday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was not immediately determined, Rayner Pike, her brother-in-law, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Rossner marshaled intriguing plot twists, precise description and deep empathy to examine women's experiences, addressing situations like pregnancy, sex with strangers and the introduction of a man into a single-parent household.         ''Many of her novels offer a clinical dissection of America's failed marriages and of a culture that has not permitted women to have a life apart from their children and husband,'' said the reference book Contemporary Novelists.         ''Mr. Goodbar,'' the fourth of Ms. Rossner's 10 novels, sold four million copies and in 1977 became a popular movie starring Diane Keaton. The book was based loosely on the 1973 murder of a young schoolteacher in New York who frequented singles bars and could be read as a particularly harrowing caution for the sexually adventurous.         Her seventh novel, ''August,'' published in 1983, was also a best seller. It is about of the complex relationship between a troubled teenager and her psychiatrist, with much of the story told in what seem like transcripts of analytic sessions.         Ms. Rossner's vivid imagination is suggested by the circumstances of the young analysand: Dawn Henley was raised by a lesbian aunt and her lover after Dawn's mother killed herself and her homosexual father drowned in a boating accident. Her foster parents have since separated.         Other fanciful plots include a woman who falls in love with a young man who turns out to be her illegitimate son in ''Emmeline'' (1980), and conjoined twins who marry two women in ''Attachments'' (1977), with the curiosity-inspiring sexual gymnastics hardly ignored.         John Leonard in The New York Times called ''Attachments'' an ''ambitious, disturbing novel by a best-selling author who might have written a trashy book, but decided instead to mess up our minds.''         Judith Perelman was born in Manhattan on March 31, 1935, and grew up in the Bronx. Her father was a textile merchant and her mother a schoolteacher who nurtured her daughter's early interest in writing. At 19 she dropped out of the City College of New York to marry Robert Rossner, a teacher and writer whose name she kept after their divorce in 1972.         She later married and divorced Mordecai Persky. She is survived by her husband Stanley Leff; her children, Daniel and Jean Rossner; her sister, Nancy Pike; and three grandchildren.         Her first marriage broke up after an ill-fated move to a New Hampshire commune, and she returned to New York, where she supported her family with secretarial work, carving out time to write her first three novels. These included ''Any Minute I Can Split,'' finished just before her first divorce.         ''My abiding theme is separations,'' she said in an interview with The Washington Post in 1983.         Ms. Rossner became fascinated by the murder of Roseann Quinn, the 27-year-old schoolteacher killed after an encounter in a singles bar, and proposed an article for a special women's issue of Esquire magazine. Esquire's lawyers, fearing the article might jeopardize the accused man's defense, killed the story.         Ms. Rossner, who was recovering from a car accident, found herself pondering the extent to which people are to blame for their own misfortunes. She wrote a one-sentence proposal for a novel on the episode to Simon & Schuster. It read: ''I want to write a book about a schoolteacher who's murdered picking up someone when she's cruising a singles bar.''         According to some published reports, she received a $5,000 advance; others say $10,000. ''Mr. Goodbar'' was sold for $300,000 as a paperback and for $250,000 as a movie, making her financially independent.         Christopher Hawtree, writing in The Guardian of London in 1990, described the book's bleak theme: ''Some of the raunchiest sex scenes ever written lead to a despair that makes death almost inevitable, perhaps even sought.''         Ms. Rossner's other books included ''To the Precipice'' (1966), ''Nine Months in the Life of an Old Maid'' (1969), ''His Little Women'' (1990), ''Olivia'' (1994) and ''Perfidia'' (1997).         Her works repeatedly explored but never explained what she considered an unsettling quandary.         ''It's astonishing what some women will put up with just to have a warm body -- some of the brightest women I know are obsessed with that search,'' she told The Washington Post. ''It's very sad.''       
         Joyce Wein, a former vice president of the company that produced the Newport Jazz and Folk Festivals and numerous other events, died on Monday at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital on the Upper East Side. She was 76 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The cause was cancer, said a spokeswoman for the company, Festival Productions, which was founded by her husband, George Wein         Mrs. Wein was a biochemist but became professionally involved in music through her marriage in 1959 to Mr. Wein, the founder of the Newport festivals and the chief executive of Festival Productions. Mrs. Wein was a vice president of the company from shortly after it was established in the early 1960's to the late 1990's, and remained involved in its operations until her death.         Besides the Newport events, Festival Productions presents the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the JVC Jazz Festival in New York and many other events worldwide. Mrs. Wein had a hand in all of them but had especially close ties with the folk festival, which her husband founded in 1959. For several years beginning in 1963, the festival was run by the nonprofit Newport Folk Foundation, which Mr. and Mrs. Wein established with the folk singer Pete Seeger and his wife, Toshi.         Joyce Alexander was born in Boston on Oct. 21, 1928, and majored in chemistry at Simmons College there. She was the jazz columnist for the Simmons student newspaper and Mr. Wein was an aspiring jazz pianist when they met at a jazz concert in Boston in 1947.         Mrs. Wein was a founder of the New York Coalition of 100 Black Women, a charitable organization, and established the Joyce and George Wein Professorship Fund in African-American Studies at Boston University and the Alexander Family Endowed Scholarship Fund at Simmons.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Eugenia Manning of San Francisco and Theodora McLaurin of Hingham, Mass.         Correction:  August 19, 2005, Friday  An obituary yesterday about Joyce Wein, who worked on music festivals and charities with her husband, George, misstated the name of one of her projects. It is the George and Joyce Wein Chair in African-American Studies at Boston University, not the George and Joyce Wein Professorship Fund.       
         Mo Mowlam, the earthy, straight-talking politician who as Britain's Northern Ireland secretary helped negotiate the Good Friday peace settlement in 1998, died Friday morning at a hospice in Canterbury, her family said. She was 55.         Unsteady on her feet at times as a result of radiotherapy treatments for a brain tumor discovered in 1997, Ms. Mowlam fell and hit her head two weeks ago, slipping into a coma from which she never recovered. She left instructions that she not be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of improvement, her family said, and doctors removed her artificial feeding tube earlier this week.         Ms. Mowlam, who retired from politics four years ago, was an unusually blunt and unusually popular member of Parliament. After the radiation treatments caused her hair to fall out, she regularly flung her wig off during negotiations and news conferences, complaining that it made her head itch.         ''I hate the bloody things and have to carry two around with me because I kept losing one,'' she once said.         During the 1998 Labor Party conference, Prime Minister Tony Blair referred to her as ''our Mo'' in passing during his keynote speech, only to have the audience unexpectedly give her a prolonged standing ovation. Although the prime minister joked about it, she later said she thought that he resented being upstaged and felt threatened by her popularity.         In any case, the two fell out politically. He removed her from her Northern Ireland post against her will in 1999, shuffling her to a less important job in the Cabinet Office, and she eventually quit politics, growing increasingly disillusioned with his New Labor government.         But as tributes poured in from across the political spectrum on Friday, the prime minister called Ms. Mowlam ''one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered'' and said she was ''great company, utterly irreverent, full of life and fun.''         ''It is no exaggeration to say she transformed the politics not just of Northern Ireland itself but crucially of relations between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom,'' he said, ''and it was this transformation that created the culture in which peacemaking could flourish.''         Marjorie Mowlam was born in 1949 and brought up in Coventry. She had a tough childhood -- her family was invariably short of money, and her father was an alcoholic. She came to politics late, at the age of 38, after working as a college lecturer.         She decided to run for Parliament just five days before the deadline to register as a candidate for the 1987 election and won a seat in Redcar, on the North Sea coast. Immensely charismatic, bawdy, unpretentious and funny, she became an integral part of Mr. Blair's rejuvenated Labor Party, helping lead it into power in the 1997 general election.         She was quickly made Northern Ireland secretary, with a mission to help effect a peace settlement for the warring province. She visited paramilitary prisoners at Maze Prison to win them over to the idea of peace.         But even as she worked hard to build good relations with Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, which wants Northern Ireland to become part of the Irish Republic, she alienated unionists, who want it to remain united with Britain and who accused her of being too sympathetic to the republican cause.         She complained that she was increasingly marginalized during the talks that eventually led to the peace agreement, saying she was no more than ''a tea lady.'' After she was removed from the Northern Ireland post, her criticism of the government grew louder. When she finally left politics, she said it had become ''harder and harder to defend what the Labor government is doing.''         In 2002 she published a memoir, ''Momentum,'' in which, among other things, she stated that Mr. Blair and Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, were not getting along.         She is survived by her husband, Jon Norton, and two stepchildren.         Her plain-spokenness extended to shouting and swearing at intransigent politicians from both sides in Northern Ireland, invariably men, and invariably tough combatants. She was once overhead saying to Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, ''Bloody well get on and do it; otherwise I'll head-butt you!''       
         Jane Lawrence Smith, an actress and singer and the widow of the architect and sculptor Tony Smith, died on Aug. 5 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 90.         Her death was announced by her family.         Ms. Smith was one of the last survivors of the central circle of Abstract Expressionist artists and companions who came to the fore in New York in the 1940's and 50's. Her husband was close to Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman, and she was the subject of one of Pollock's late black-and-white paintings, ''No. 7'' (1952), now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Two of her daughters, Kiki Smith and Seton Smith, are artists, adding to her prominence in the art world, but she made a career of her own in entertainment.         Jane Lawrence was born in Bozeman, Mont., in 1915 and raised in Mount Vernon, Wash. At 16, she began studying theater. By the time she was 18, she was living in New York and making her way in the theater. She appeared on Broadway in the original casts of ''Oklahoma!,'' ''Inside U.S.A.'' and ''Where's Charley?,'' the musical based on ''Charley's Aunt.'' As June Lawrence, she appeared in the Columbia Pictures movie ''Sailor's Holiday'' (1944), and she was also in three independent films.         In 1943 she married Tony Smith in Hollywood, with her close friend Tennessee Williams as best man. Her family said she helped inspire aspects of the character Blanche DuBois in Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire.''         In 1950 she traveled to Europe and began an opera career in Germany; the next year she sang the part of Electra in the 1951 Salzburg Festival presentation of ''Idomeneo,'' conducted by Georg Solti. After her husband's death, in 1980, she resumed her acting career, this time in avant-garde theater, and worked with the directors John Jesurun, Joan Jonas and Marianne Weems.         Ms. Smith's daughter Beatrice Smith Robinson died in 1988. In addition to her daughters Kiki and Seton, who live in New York, she is survived by a granddaughter.       
         Ernesta Drinker Ballard, who saved the Philadelphia Flower Show and transformed it from a horticultural beauty show into a spectacular international educational event, died Aug. 11 at the Cathedral Village retirement community in Philadelphia. She was 85 and formerly lived in the Chestnut Hill area of Philadelphia.         The cause was complications of a stroke, her family said.         For 18 years, from 1963 to 1981, she was the executive director of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. Early in that period, the society's annual flower show, which began in 1829 and eventually grew into the largest indoor flower show in the United States was faltering, and a two-year suspension was discussed. Mrs. Ballard argued that a suspension might be fatal and instead changed the content of the show, bringing it to international prominence.         An exhibitor herself, she directed the show for 17 years, until 1981. She opened it to amateur growers and used it as a teaching laboratory for a wider public. Last year's show covered more than 30 acres with flower, garden and landscape displays and competitions, and lectures, workshops and cooking demonstrations. It drew more than a quarter million visitors.         Under Mrs. Ballard's guidance, the event began to produce a financial surplus, which she used to start the Horticultural Society's community gardening program, Philadelphia Green. That program, which turns vacant lots into vegetable gardens and flower beds, became one of the largest such urban greening projects in the nation.         Mrs. Ballard also played a leading role in saving public monuments like the Swann Fountain on Logan Circle and restoring the buildings and grounds of Philadelphia's historic Fairmount Waterworks. She was a Fairmount Park commissioner for 21 years, until 2002.         Ernesta Drinker was born into a distinguished Philadelphia family, a daughter of a prominent lawyer, Harry Drinker, and Sophie Hutcheson Drinker, a feminist and author. She was not encouraged to attend college but graduated as an adult from the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women (now part of Temple University) in 1954, when she started her own greenhouse business.         Mrs. Ballard was also known as the ''godmother of Philadelphia feminism.'' She was a founder of local chapters of groups like the National Organization for Women and campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' (1963) by Betty Friedan propelled Mrs. Ballard toward feminism, and it was Ms. Friedan who invited her to start the NOW chapter. She was also a co-founder of Women's Way, a seminal Philadelphia fund-raising group that supports an array of women's organizations and causes.         Mrs. Ballard's husband, Frederic, a prominent lawyer and former president of the American Bonsai Association, died in 2001. She is survived by their son, Frederic L. Jr., of Bethesda, Md.; three daughters, Alice W. Ballard of Philadelphia, Sophie B. Bilezikian of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Ernesta Ballard of Ketchikan, Alaska; a sister, Cecilia D. Saltonstall of Exeter, N.H.; a brother, Henry Drinker of Bedford, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Nell I. Mondy, a Cornell biochemist who extolled the nutritional benefits of the potato to consumers worldwide and pushed hard to dispel its reputation as a weighty clump of empty calories, died on Aug. 25 at Cayuga Medical Center in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 83.         The cause was complications after an operation, said a friend, Marion Howe.         After early research in vitamins, Dr. Mondy became passionate about potatoes in the 1950's, drawn by their nutritional richness, low cost and long life in storage.         In her four decades at Cornell, she compared the taste of different varieties, examined color changes in potatoes and continually promoted their value as a staple food providing amino acids, protein, calcium, vitamin C, iron and other nutrients. In fact, Dr. Mondy said that meals of potatoes and milk provided enough nutrition for a healthy diet.         Dr. Robert L. Plaisted, an emeritus professor of plant breeding at Cornell, said that Dr. Mondy tested big king, Atlantic, Katahdin and other potato varieties, and investigated why some varieties darkened after cooking, a trait considered undesirable by consumers. She also assembled panels of potato tasters to better define the subtleties of different varieties, and then tried to explain differences on a biochemical basis.         In 1987, Dr. Mondy's research created a public stir when she and a graduate student, Barry Gosselin, released a study suggesting that a naturally occurring toxic compound found in potatoes could be hazardous to human health.         The compounds, called glycoalkaloids, become concentrated in the potato skin, especially when exposed to light, but enormous quantities would have to be eaten to result in harm. Regardless, Dr. Mondy recommended removing the skins.         In the 1990's, she reported other potential health hazards from potato skins. Dr. Mondy and others found that chemicals sprayed on potatoes to prevent sprouting in storage often arrived at the grocery store in significantly higher levels than federal guidelines recommended.         She also promoted potatoes as a crop for developing countries, particularly in Africa.         Nell Irene Mondy was born in Pocahontas, Ark. She earned an undergraduate degree from Ouachita Baptist College and a master's degree from the University of Texas. In 1953, Cornell awarded her a doctorate in biochemistry.         Dr. Mondy was appointed an associate professor of food and nutrition at Cornell in 1953, and became a professor there in 1961. While at Cornell, she was a consultant to Frito-Lay, Procter & Gamble and other food companies before retiring in 1992.         She wrote an autobiography, ''You Never Fail Until You Stop Trying: The Story of a Pioneer Woman Chemist,'' in 2001.         She lived in Ithaca.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Constance Baker Motley, a civil rights lawyer who fought nearly every important civil rights case for two decades and then became the first black woman to serve as a federal judge, died yesterday at NYU Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Isolde Motley, her daughter-in-law.         Judge Motley was the first black woman to serve in the New York State Senate, as well as the first woman to be Manhattan borough president, a position that guaranteed her a voice in running the entire city under an earlier system of local government called the Board of Estimate.         Judge Motley was at the center of the firestorm that raged through the South in the two decades after World War II, as blacks and their white allies pressed to end the segregation that had gripped the region since Reconstruction. She visited the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in jail, sang freedom songs in churches that had been bombed, and spent a night under armed guard with Medgar Evers, the civil rights leader who was later murdered.         But her métier was in the quieter, painstaking preparation and presentation of lawsuits that paved the way to fuller societal participation by blacks. She dressed elegantly, spoke in a low, lilting voice and, in case after case, earned a reputation as the chief courtroom tactician of the civil rights movement.         Gov. George C. Wallace of Alabama and other staunch segregationists yielded, kicking and screaming, to the verdicts of courts ruling against racial segregation. These huge victories were led by the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, led by Thurgood Marshall, for which Judge Motley, Jack Greenberg, Robert Carter and a handful of other underpaid, overworked lawyers labored.         In particular, she directed the legal campaign that resulted in the admission of James H. Meredith to the University of Mississippi in 1962. She argued 10 cases before the United States Supreme Court and won nine of them.         Judge Motley won cases that ended segregation in Memphis restaurants and at whites-only lunch counters in Birmingham, Ala. She fought for King's right to march in Albany, Ga. She played an important role in representing blacks seeking admission to the Universities of Florida, Georgia Alabama and Mississippi and Clemson College in South Carolina.         She helped write briefs in the landmark school desegregation case Brown v. Board of Education in 1954 and in later elementary-school integration cases.         Judge Motley was a tall, gracious and stately woman whose oft-stated goal was as simple as it was sometimes elusive: dignity for all people. Her personal approach was also dignified. When a reporter wrote that she had demanded some action by the court, she soon corrected him:         ''What do you mean 'I demanded the court'? You don't demand, you pray for relief or move for some action.''         Charlayne Hunter-Gault, whose admission to the University of Georgia was engineered by Mrs. Motley's legal finesse, described her courtroom cunning.         ''Mrs. Motley's style could be deceptive, often challenging a witness to get away with one lie after another without challenging them,'' she wrote in her book ''In My Place,'' published in 1992. ''It was as if she would lull them into an affirmation of their own arrogance, causing them to relax as she appeared to wander aimlessly off into and around left field, until she suddenly threw a curveball with so much skill and power it would knock them off their chair.''         As a black woman practicing law in the South, she endured gawking and more than a few physical threats. A local paper in Jackson, Miss., derided her as ''the Motley woman.''         In 1966, President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her as a judge on the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York at the urging of Senator Robert F. Kennedy of New York, a Democrat, and with the support of Senator Jacob K. Javits, a Republican. The opposition of Southern senators like James O. Eastland, a Mississippi Democrat, was beaten back, and her appointment was confirmed. She became chief judge of the district in 1982 and senior judge in 1986.         Constance Baker was born on Sept. 14, 1921, in New Haven, the ninth of 12 children. Her parents came from the tiny Caribbean island Nevis at the beginning of the 20th century.         Her father worked as a chef for various Yale University student organizations, including Skull and Bones. She attended local schools in what was then an overwhelmingly white community.         One of her first experiences with discrimination came at 15, when she was turned away from a public beach because she was black.         She read books dealing with black history and became president of the local N.A.A.C.P. youth council. She decided that she wanted to be a lawyer, but her family lacked money to send their many children to college. After high school, she struggled to earn a living as a domestic worker.         When she was 18, she made a speech at local African-American social center that was heard by Clarence W. Blakeslee, a white businessman and philanthropist who sponsored the center. He was impressed and offered to finance her education.         She decided to attend Fisk University, a black college in Nashville, partly because she had never been to the South. In Nashville, she encountered a rigidly segregated society, and brought her parents a poignant souvenir: a sign that read ''Colored Only.''         After a year and a half at Fisk, she transferred to New York University. After graduation in 1943, she entered Columbia Law School, where she began to work as a volunteer at the N.A.A.C.P.'s Legal Defense and Education Fund, an affiliate of the National Organization for the Advancement of Colored People that Mr. Marshall and his mentor, Charles Houston, had created in 1939.         After she graduated in 1946, she began to work full time for the civil rights group at a salary of $50 a week. She worked first on housing cases, fighting to break the restrictive covenants that barred blacks from white neighborhoods.         Also in 1946, she married Joel Wilson Motley Jr., a New York real estate broker. He survives her, as does their son, Joel III, who lives in Scarborough, N.Y.; three grandchildren; her brother Edmund Baker of Florida; and her sisters Edna Carnegie, Eunice Royster and Marian Green, all of New Haven.         Mr. Marshall had no qualms about sending her into the tensest racial terrain, precisely because she was a woman. She said she believed that was why she was assigned to the Meredith case in 1961.         ''Thurgood says that the only people who are safe in the South are the women -- white and Negro,'' she said in an interview with Pictorial Living, the magazine of The New York Journal-American, in 1965. ''I don't know how he's got that figured. But, so far, I've never been subjected to any violence.''         Mr. Meredith's admission to the University of Mississippi in September 1962 was a major victory for the civil rights movement. Mrs. Motley worked on the case for 18 months before Mr. Meredith's name was even seen in the papers.         She made 22 trips to Mississippi as the case dragged on. Judge Motley once called the day Mr. Meredith accepted his diploma in 1963 the most thrilling in her life.         She said her greatest professional satisfaction came with the reinstatement of 1,100 black children in Birmingham who had been expelled for taking part in street demonstrations in the spring of 1963.         In February 1964, Mrs. Motley's high-level civil rights profile drew her into politics. A Democratic State Senate candidate from the Upper West Side was ruled off the ballot because of an election-law technicality. She accepted the nomination on the condition that it would not interfere with her N.A.A.C.P. work and handily defeated a Republican to become the first black woman elected to the State Senate. She was re-elected that November.         She remained in the job until February 1965, when she was chosen by unanimous vote of the City Council to fill a one-year vacancy as Manhattan borough president. In citywide elections nine months later, she was re-elected to a full four-year term with the endorsement of the Democratic, Republican and Liberal Parties.         As borough president, she drew up a seven-point program for the revitalization of Harlem and East Harlem, securing $700,000 to plan for those and other underprivileged areas of the city.         After becoming a federal judge in 1966, Judge Motley ruled in many cases, but her decisions often reflected her past. She decided on behalf of welfare recipients, low-income Medicaid patients and a prisoner who claimed to have been unconstitutionally punished by 372 days of solitary confinement, whom she awarded damages.         She continued to try cases after she took senior status. Her hope as a judge was that she would change the world for the better, she said.         ''The work I'm doing now will affect people's lives intimately,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1977, ''it may even change them.''         Correction:  October 5, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary on Thursday about Constance Baker Motley, the first black woman to serve as a federal judge, misstated the given name of her surviving brother and the means by which she was named to fill a vacancy as Manhattan borough president. Her brother is Edward Baker, not Edmund; she took office by a unanimous vote of the City Council members from Manhattan, not of the Council as a whole. The article also misstated part of the name of the civil rights organization that was then the parent of the Legal Defense and Educational Fund, for which Judge Motley began volunteer work in 1943. It is the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People -- not National Organization.       
         Nora Kerr, a longtime editor at The New York Times and a former editor of its Sunday Travel section, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 61 and a Manhattan resident.         Ms. Kerr, who retired from the paper this month, died after having been ill with cancer for some years, her husband, Gordy Thompson, said.         Ms. Kerr joined The Times in 1976 as a copy editor; she was later editor of the paper's Westchester Weekly section and an assistant metropolitan editor. She was editor of the Travel section from 1986 to 1989, and was afterward an editor in The Times Magazine and the Arts & Leisure and Culture sections.         Nora Kerr was born on Nov. 19, 1943, in Cairo, where her parents had met during the war; the family later moved to New Jersey. She attended William Paterson College and Rutgers University and from 1967 to 1976 was a reporter and editor at The Bergen Record.         Ms. Kerr's first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Thompson, a retired manager of Internet services at The Times, Ms. Kerr is survived by their son, Andrew Kerr-Thompson; her mother, Hermine, of Wayne, N.J.; and a sister, Jacqueline Kerr Harrold, of Benton, Pa.       
         Ruth Levine Sussman, an acting New York State Supreme Court justice who organized and headed the state system's first Integrated Domestic Violence Court, in the Bronx, died on Aug. 26 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 46.         The cause was breast cancer, according to an announcement by Judith S. Kaye, chief judge of the Court of Appeals, who selected her in 2001 for the special panel, a pilot project for the state court system.         Justice Sussman grew up in Schenectady, N.Y. She graduated from Smith College in 1980 and received her law degree from Georgetown University's School of Law in 1983, then became an assistant prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office.         Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed her a Civil Court judge in 1995, after which she was assigned to Family Court and Criminal Court. She was named an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1999.         The Integrated Domestic Violence Court was created by Chief Judge Kaye to bring before a single judge all court proceedings involving domestic violence cases. Those include criminal, family and matrimonial issues that, under the prevailing system, were divided among the Criminal Court, Family Court and Supreme Court.         In her final days on the bench, in mid-June, Justice Sussman was conducting hearings under the Sex Offender Registration Act, known as Megan's Law, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.         As she was being treated for her illness, Justice Sussman, helped by family and friends, raised money toward a Sussman Family Fund for research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The center said that the effort had contributed more than $500,000 to its breast cancer programs.         Justice Sussman is survived by her husband, David W. Sussman; their daughters, Jane and Rebecca; her parents, Judge Howard A. and Barbara Levine of Schenectady; and two brothers, Neil and James Levine, also of Schenectady.       
         Dr. Margot S. Kruskall, a Harvard hematologist and an expert on blood banks who was an early advocate for patients' donations of their own blood before surgery, a practice propelled by the spread of AIDS in the 1980's, died on Aug. 27 at her home in Dover, Mass. She was 56. The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         In 1982, when Dr. Kruskall headed Beth Israel Hospital's blood bank and hematology laboratory in Boston, she established a program for patients to donate and store their own blood, in large part stemming from concerns about hepatitis infections.         The practice, known as autologous donation, was known for more than a century, although it had never before been instituted on a wide scale. Dr. Kruskall and others at Beth Israel set up a system to label the blood, decided what surgical procedures were best served by it and created an inventory system.         The program's timing was propitious, coming just as H.I.V. was being recognized as a blood-borne virus.         When similar programs appeared nationwide, Dr. Kruskall and others analyzed their effectiveness and published the findings in the journal Transfusion in 1986. Autologous donations have since declined, largely because of closer controls on blood banks and the application of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells and markedly reduces the need for blood transfusions.         Dr. Justine M. Carr, a hematologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a former director of the hematology lab there, said Dr. Kruskall began to research the viability of erythropoietin in the 1980's, helping to prove its effectiveness and determine dosages.         She and other scientists later developed a blood test to detect erythropoietin, which has been used by athletes to reduce muscle fatigue and illicitly enhance performance.         More recently, Dr. Kruskall pursued research to develop a kind of universal red blood cell that could be safely infused, regardless of a patient's blood type. She worked with Type B blood, modifying its red cells with enzymes to react like the cells in blood Type O, which can be received by most patients.         Margot Sheffield Kruskall was born in New York City. She earned an undergraduate degree from Jackson College of Tufts University, and her medical degree from the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1974.         She arrived at Beth Israel in 1976 and remained for the rest of her career, ultimately serving as director of the division of laboratory and transfusion medicine. Harvard appointed her an associate professor of medicine in 1992 and a professor of pathology in 2002.         Dr. Kruskall was an associate editor of Transfusion.         She is survived by her husband of 32 years, Dr. Stephen Kruskall, co-chairman of the emergency room at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Mass.; a son, Peter; two daughters, Gillian and Lauren, all of Dover; and by a sister, Denni Day of Rochester.       
         Kathy Wilson, who as head of the National Women's Political Caucus in the 1980's lobbied on behalf of issues affecting women's lives, from the proposed equal rights amendment to the right to an abortion, died on Sept. 1 while vacationing in Rehoboth Beach, Del. She was 54 and lived in Alexandria, Va.         Ms. Wilson died in her sleep, apparently of heart failure, her sister-in-law Ann Goodrich said.         Founded in 1971, the National Women's Political Caucus is a bipartisan group that seeks to foster women's participation in the political process. Ms. Wilson was its chairwoman for two terms, from 1981 to 1985, and was previously its first vice chairwoman. In recent years, Ms. Wilson worked in early childhood education, the field in which she originally trained.         Among the changes Ms. Wilson advocated during her tenure were the election of more women to public office, the appointment of women to cabinet and other high-level government positions and equal pay for women.         An almost life-long Republican, she became an outspoken critic of President Ronald Reagan and supported the candidacy of Walter F. Mondale and Geraldine A. Ferraro in the 1984 presidential race.         ''I believe in individual rights and the absence of government interference in those rights,'' she told People magazine in 1983. She added: ''I have worked for scores of Republican candidates, but I'm not going to toe the party line when I have a president who seeks to send me down the time tunnel as a woman.''         Kathleen Anne Higdon was born in Quonset Point, R.I., the daughter of a Navy pilot and a homemaker. The family moved wherever her father's job took them, settling in St. Louis when she was a teenager. The Higdons were ardent Republicans, and much of Ms. Wilson's ideology was forged at the dining-room table.         Ms. Wilson earned a bachelor's degree in education, with a concentration in special education, from the University of Missouri in 1973; she married a fellow student, Paul O. Wilson, the next year. In 1976, she earned a master's in education from Missouri.         After college, Ms. Wilson worked briefly as a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines, a job that she quickly came to loathe, her family said. She then worked in the convention sales department of a Kansas City hotel; in less than a year, she was the top saleswoman there. But after spending several months training two male employees to do the job, Ms. Wilson discovered that they were being paid $100 more a month than she was.         ''I walked out,'' she told The New York Times in 1981, ''and joined the women's movement.''         Moving to Washington in 1977 to work as a research analyst for the Department of Labor, Ms. Wilson remained politically active. She founded several chapters of the women's political caucus, including its Northern Virginia chapter, before becoming involved with the national organization.         Ms. Wilson's full-time entry into politics coincided with her years as a young mother. When her children were small, she often took them to out-of-town engagements, presenting what she viewed as a living demonstration of the compatibility of career and family. She attended the 1980 Republican National Convention -- visibly pregnant -- with a button supporting abortion rights pinned conspicuously to her lapel.         Ms. Wilson is survived by her husband, a Republican political consultant; a daughter, Casey Rose Wilson, of New York City and Los Angeles; a son, Fletcher Todd Wilson, a student at the University of Pennsylvania; her father, Marion Higdon, of Pensacola, Fla.; and a brother, Bruce D. Higdon, also of Pensacola.         For the last 14 years, Ms. Wilson worked as the director of a preschool in Alexandria. A few years ago, her sister-in-law said, she left the Republican Party.       
         Toni Trent Parker, an author who helped advance the cause of books featuring African-American children, died on Thursday at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 58.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         To increase the visibility of black children in children's books, Ms. Parker and two friends, Donna Rand and Sheila Foster, established a company to help promote such books and later wrote a series of four guides, ''Black Books Galore! Guide to Great African American Children's Books.'' The guides, first published in 1998 by John Wiley & Sons, are available at www.blackbooksgalore.com.         Children's picture books featuring or including minority children were largely absent before the 1960's, when the first few were published and authors and other advocates began criticizing what they viewed as prejudice in the publishing industry, said Leonard S. Marcus, a book reviewer for Parenting magazine.         By promoting sales, raising awareness and adding to the literature, Ms. Parker helped bring more books with black children into the mainstream, he said.         In 1998 she established Kids Cultural Books, a nonprofit organization that holds book festivals around the country to bring multicultural books and their authors together with children. The organization received a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in 2000.         Ms. Parker wrote six children's picture books, including holiday books and a keepsake book, all picturing black children. Her most recent title, ''Sienna's Scrapbook'' (Chronicle Books, 2005), portrays an young African-American girl and her family visiting black cultural and historical sites in the United States.         Toni Trent Parker was born in 1947 in Winston-Salem, N.C. She earned a bachelor's degree in history from Oberlin College in 1970, and did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley.         Ms. Parker is survived by her husband, Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. of Stamford, who is on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; their daughters, Christine, Kathleen and Jennifer, all of Stamford; her mother, Viola Trent of Greensboro, N.C.; and two sisters, Kay Holloway of Potomac, Md., and Judy Scales-Trent of Buffalo, N.Y.       
         Molly Yard, for more than half a century an outspoken advocate for liberal causes, who came to national prominence as president of the National Organization for Women in the late 1980's, died yesterday at a nursing home in Pittsburgh. She was 93 and had resided most recently in Arlington, Va., and Washington.         Ms. Yard's son James Garrett confirmed her death.         Active since the 1930's in student and civil rights movements, Ms. Yard served as NOW's president from 1987 until 1991. She was previously the organization's political director.         During her tenure, NOW championed issues including abortion, gay and lesbian rights and the election of women to public office. In 1987, in one of its most vigorous campaigns, it opposed the nomination to the Supreme Court of Judge Robert H. Bork, whom Ms. Yard publicly condemned as ''a Neanderthal.'' She also called for the impeachment of President Ronald Reagan over the Iran-contra affair.         Ms. Yard spent so much time pounding unforgiving marble in various corridors of power that she developed permanent nerve damage in her feet, The Washington Post reported in 1987.         Mary Alexander Yard was born in Shanghai on July 6, 1912, and raised in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, where her parents were Methodist missionaries. At her birth, one of her father's male friends presented him with a beautiful brass bowl. It was meant as a consolation prize. Ms. Yard was the family's third daughter.         Growing up in China, Ms. Yard later said, helped set her on her course as a social activist. She saw many people die of cholera. She also heard screams whose source she could not immediately identify.         ''I asked my father what was going on, and he said it was a young girl whose feet are bound,'' Ms. Yard told The Post in 1987. ''They used to unbind them at night in order for the blood to circulate.''         The Yards lived in China until Ms. Yard was about 13, when her father angered church superiors by proposing that their missions in China be turned over to the Chinese. The family moved to the United States, where Mr. Yard became the director of religious activities for Northwestern University -- until he angered superiors there with his work as a civil rights and labor organizer. Through much of the Depression, Ms. Yard's mother, who ran a mail-order business selling imported Chinese goods, was the family's sole support.         Ms. Yard became politically active as a student at Swarthmore. After discovering that the sorority to which she belonged would not admit Jews, she campaigned successfully to abolish all sororities on campus. She graduated in 1933, with a bachelor's degree in political science.         In 1938, Ms. Yard married a Swarthmore classmate, Sylvester Garrett, keeping her maiden name. When the couple tried to open a joint checking account, Ms. Yard would later recall, they were told they could not do so under two different surnames. If only Ms. Yard had been Mr. Garrett's mistress, the bank told her, it would have been no problem at all.         Mr. Garrett, a noted labor arbitrator who taught at Stanford and elsewhere, died in 1996. Besides her son, of McDonald, Pa., Ms. Yard is survived by another son, John Garrett, of Fairport, N.Y., and five grandchildren. A daughter, Joan Garrett-Goodyear, died in 1992.         After college, Ms. Yard began a career as a social worker but soon realized that politics was a better outlet for her unrelenting energy. As an officer of the American Student Union, a left-wing youth organization, Ms. Yard struck up a long friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt, whom she credited as a deep influence. Ms. Yard was later a board member of Americans for Democratic Action.         During her husband's years at Stanford, Ms. Yard immersed herself in Democratic politics in California, supporting Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas in her Senate race against Richard M. Nixon in 1950. After her family moved to Pittsburgh a few years later, Ms. Yard worked in the civil rights movement and was a local organizer for the March on Washington in 1963. She entered electoral politics as a candidate only once, running unsuccessfully for the Pennsylvania legislature in 1964.         Ms. Yard joined NOW in the early 1970's and for the next decade worked on its campaign, ultimately unsuccessful, to have the equal rights amendment ratified. In 1987, Eleanor Smeal, Ms. Yard's mentor and NOW's departing president, suggested she run for the position. In her mid-70's, Ms. Yard demurred at first.         ''I thought if I were 10 years younger, I would love to do it,'' she told People magazine in 1987. ''Then I remembered Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony never stopped, even in their 80's.''         Ms. Yard's reputation as a forceful negotiator stood her in such good stead that she did not have to be physically present to get results. In 1987, Patricia Blau Reuss, who was the legislative director for the Women's Equity Action League at the time, told The Washington Post what it was like to lobby members of Congress with Ms. Yard as a bargaining chip:         ''We would say, 'Look, you either deal with me or you have to answer to Molly,''' Ms. Reuss said. ''They always relent.''       
         Shirley Horn, a jazz singer and pianist who drew audiences close with a powerfully confidential, vibratoless delivery, died yesterday at a nursing home in Cheverly, Md. She was 71. Her death was announced by Regina Joskow, vice president of publicity at the Verve Music Group, Ms. Horn's label.         Ms. Horn was a unique singer, with one of the slowest deliveries in jazz and a very unusual way of phrasing, putting stress on certain words and letting others slip away. She cherished her repertory, making audiences feel that she was cutting through to the stark truths of songs like ''Here's to Life'' and ''You Won't Forget Me.'' She wanted things just so: she stuck with her drummer, Steve Williams, for 23 years, and her bassist, Charles Ables -- who died in 2002 -- for 33.         She lived all her life in and around Washington, often performing close to home to be near her family. But over the last two decades she enjoyed a quietly expanding revival of the concert and club career she had begun in the 1950's, and she became a star in the jazz world.         When she was 4, her mother had her start piano lessons. In her teens she won a scholarship to Juilliard, but it was decided that living in New York would cost the family too much money; she studied classical music at Howard University in Washington instead.         She recalled that at 17, while she was playing classical music at a restaurant in Washington, a man appeared in front of her with a four-foot-tall turquoise teddy bear. ''If you sing 'Melancholy Baby,''' he said, ''I'll give you this bear.'' She did, and he did.         At the time Ms. Horn was shy and largely focused on classical music, but she often cited this as the moment when it dawned on her that if she overcame her reluctance to sing and to play jazz in public, she might be able to make a living at it. About her transition from classical to jazz, she liked to say: ''I loved Rachmaninoff, but then Oscar Peterson became my Rachmaninoff. And Ahmad Jamal became my Debussy.''         From 1954, she led her own jazz trio in Washington. In 1960 she recorded her first album, ''Embers and Ashes,'' for a small label called Stere-o-Craft. It was not widely heard, but Miles Davis heard it, and a year later he tracked down her telephone number in Washington and invited her to open for him at the Village Vanguard in New York. That exposure, plus the help of the jazz agent and manager John Levy, helped get her a contract with Mercury Records.         Mercury signed Ms. Horn as a singer, not a singer-pianist. Although some of the great piano-playing accompanists, including Hank Jones and Jimmy Jones, were hired to play on her records, and although ''Loads of Love,'' from 1962, showcased her voice well -- she could sound like a quieter, subtler version of Dinah Washington -- the situation made her uncomfortable.         By the mid-1960's she had stopped touring and decided to restrict her performing to the Washington and Baltimore areas so she could spend more time at home raising her daughter, Rainy. From 1963 to 1978 she made only two records -- ''Travelin' Light'' for ABC-Paramount and ''Where Are You Going?'' for Perception. From 1978 to 1984, she recorded for the Danish label Steeplechase and slowly came back into the awareness of jazz fans.         In 1982, she played her first New York performance in more than 15 years, at Michael's Pub, and in 1986 she was signed by Verve. The company built up her career all over again over the course of 11 albums, including ''You Won't Forget Me'' (1990), which featured guest appearances by Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis; ''I Remember Miles'' (1998), which won a Grammy Award; and a few that featured string sections.         Ms. Horn's survivors include her husband, Sheppard Deering, of Upper Marlboro, Md.; her daughter, Rainy Smith, of Maryland; and several grandchildren.         Ms. Horn had been fighting breast cancer for some time when complications of diabetes led to the amputation of her right foot in 2002. For a few years she performed sitting in a chair and facing the audience directly, away from the piano, which was played by George Mesterhazy. But in her final performances in New York, a two-week stretch at Le Jazz Au Bar that started last Dec. 30, she was back at the piano again, with the help of a prosthetic device that helped her to use the instrument's sustain pedal.         Three of those performances will be released in October on a Verve anthology of her work, ''But Beautiful: The Best of Shirley Horn.''       
         Enid A. Haupt, whose philanthropy benefited libraries, museums and hospitals but who devoted much of her considerable fortune to creating public gardens and preserving horticultural institutions, died on Tuesday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 99, and also kept a residence in Manhattan.         Her death was announced by her niece Cynthia Hazen Polsky.         Mrs. Haupt was fond of saying that ''nature is my religion.'' For more than five decades her greatest pleasure was sharing that religion.         A principal beneficiary of this passion was the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Over the years it received more than $34 million and will also receive a substantial gift from her estate. A major portion of her gift went to the resurrection of the garden's glass-domed Victorian conservatory, which by the 1970's had become a sodden and broken-paned ruin. The conservatory now bears her name.         ''People are refreshed, their minds are cleared, when they take a walk in a garden,'' she once said, explaining her interest in making public spaces beautiful. ''It's a marvelous escape from reality.''         Her other gifts were far-ranging and continuous. In the last 25 years alone they totaled more than $140 million, including $35 million to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She also endowed 10 faculty positions and had been an active member of the cancer center's Board of Overseers. Other beneficiaries included the Enid A. Haupt Garden at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, four acres of Victorian formal gardens, a section of which is entered through nine-foot-high moon gates, and another area with North African accents. In 1993, Mrs. Haupt donated 15 works of art, valued at more than $5 million, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, four years later, further works valued at $1.7 million, part of a total contribution of more than $13 million. A $1.5 million Haupt endowment maintains the gardens at the Cloisters in Upper Manhattan.         She also contributed $1 million to buy River Farm, a former home of George Washington in Alexandria, Va., for use as the national headquarters of the American Horticultural Society (with a stipulation that the 27 acres be open to the public). Another $1 million went to help the restoration of Bryant Park, adjoining the New York Public Library, once a haven for drug dealers and now a Midtown oasis. The library itself received more than $1.5 million, including $300,000 for a 1989 exhibition of flowers.         Mrs. Haupt's other important philanthropies included a multimillion-dollar gift to the Wildlife Conservation Society, some of which went to the restoration of Bronx Zoo Jungle World and some to an endowment fund for the project. She underwrote the Haupt Fountains on the Ellipse in Washington, between the White House and the Washington Monument. Other sizable contributions went to the restoration of the glass conservatory in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and to the Enid A. Haupt Library Annex of the Horticultural Society of New York. There were also gifts to the Monet garden in Giverny, France, and the National Wildflower Research Center in Austin, Tex. A gift of Édouard Vuillard's ''Place Vintimille'' to the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1998 was valued at $3.5 million.         A dreamer who was able to see many of her dreams take shape, she was also a realist, aware that even the best-laid plans require follow-up, and she devoted considerable time to the projects in which she took a particular interest. She was once asked how often the projects she supported ended up as she had visualized them. ''When they think I'll see it,'' she said.         Once committed to a project, she never wavered. When she wanted additional funds, she disposed of cherished possessions, seemingly without a qualm. Nineteen pieces from her collection of jewels brought more than $2 million at auction in the early 1970's. The money went immediately to her horticultural interests. In 1983, when she wanted $25 million to provide an ambulatory care center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she sold 15 of her French Impressionist paintings, including works by Gauguin, Cézanne, Renoir and van Gogh, to her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher, philanthropist and former ambassador to Britain. He died in 2002.         Mrs. Haupt was the fourth, and last surviving, of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, the publisher who founded Triangle Publications, whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, The Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television stations. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom devoted much of their inherited wealth to public institutions.         Mrs. Haupt was married in 1936 to Ira Haupt, the founder and senior partner in a Wall Street securities concern, a marriage that lasted until Mr. Haupt's death in 1963. An earlier marriage to Norman Bensinger of Chicago, whom she had met while horseback riding, ended in divorce.         An intensely private woman -- Mrs. Haupt often wandered through the New York Botanical Garden when she felt there was little chance that she would be recognized -- she became less interested in the trappings of wealth as she grew older.         The gift that gave her the most satisfaction, she said, was one of her earliest and least heralded: the Enid A. Haupt Glass Garden, a playground for children who are patients at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine at New York University Medical Center. In 1959, she enveloped the playground, which was almost immediately nicknamed the Garden of Enid, in a greenhouse with soft music and made it a serene wheelchair-accessible haven for patients of every age and for staff members and visitors. Almost $1 million was donated for an endowment to maintain it.         Enid Annenberg was born in Chicago on May 13, 1906, and grew up in Milwaukee, where she attended the German-English Academy, now the University School. The family later moved to Manhattan and then to Long Island, but Enid was sent away to school at Mount Ida Seminary in Newton, Mass.         Although she was brought up at a time when careers for women from affluent families were not common, she was, she said, ''very adventurous and curious about everything and very different from my sisters.'' One of her first jobs was at The Philadelphia Inquirer, part of her father's publishing empire. During World War II, she wrote and broadcast for the Office of War Information, coining such phrases as ''If you can shell a pea, you can pack a parachute.''         In 1954, she became the publisher of Seventeen, the magazine for teenage girls, owned at the time by the Annenberg family. A year later, she became its editor, and for 15 years she directed the magazine from a pink swiveled throne in a large office dominated by pink curtains and pink flowers. During part of her tenure at the magazine, she also wrote a syndicated column, ''Young Living.''         She also wrote four books on young living and etiquette, with advice on how to meet boys and, once met, what to do about kissing. She recommended art exhibitions as a fine place to meet young men and once met, dropping a casual remark to capture their interest. Her suggestions of casual remarks included, ''What's chiaroscuro?'' and ''Picasso's Blue Period, I believe.''         If chiaroscuro or Picasso led to kissing, there was further advice: ''Kiss him lightly on the lips but don't go into a frantic clutch -- tilt your face ever so slightly so that the noses won't bump.''         Her serious collecting of Impressionist art began during her marriage to Mr. Haupt. ''My husband was also very interested and he supplied the money,'' she said.         She also made major gifts to museums. Six bronze sculptures by Giacometti, a sculpture by Henry Moore and a painting by Mark Rothko were among 13 pieces she gave to the National Gallery of Art in 1977.         She traced her interest in horticulture to a pot of huge purple orchids displayed in a friend's house in Milwaukee when she was a child. Much later, when a business associate of Mr. Haupt asked what she wanted as a wedding present, she said orchids, and orchids she got -- 13 tubs of cymbidiums from England.       
         C. DeLores Tucker, an outspoken advocate for minority and women's rights who marched arm in arm with Martin Luther King Jr. at Selma, Ala., and campaigned against profanity-ridden rap music lyrics, died on Oct. 12 at a rehabilitation center in Philadelphia. She was 78.         Peter Bailey, editor of ''Vital Issues: The Journal of African-American Speeches,'' which Mrs. Tucker founded, confirmed her death.         When she was 16, Mrs. Tucker raised her voice from the back of a flatbed truck to protest a Philadelphia hotel's refusal to admit black athletes. She went on to become the highest-ranking black woman in any state government when she served as secretary of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania in the 1970's.         She started the first Commission on the Status of Women in Pennsylvania and helped found and led the National Political Congress of Black Women. She held leadership positions in the Democratic Party, the National Women's Caucus and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, among many other organizations.         Mrs. Tucker achieved perhaps her greatest fame in the 1990's when she campaigned against gangsta rap lyrics, calling them ''sleazy, pornographic smut.'' At one point, she bought 20 shares of Time-Warner stock and rose at an annual meeting to demand the company's leaders read aloud the lyrics on records one of their subsidiaries was selling. They declined.         In her zeal to fight gangsta rap, the fiercely partisan Democrat found herself allied with William J. Bennett, the conservative Republican who held top posts in the presidential administrations of Ronald Reagan and George H. W. Bush.         Despite having raised more than $1 million for the N.A.A.C.P. as a public speaker, she picketed the organization's Image Awards because the rapper Tupac Shakur had been nominated for one. At the time, he was accused of sexually assaulting a 20-year-old female fan in New York and with shooting two Atlanta police officers in a traffic dispute.         At her funeral on Oct. 21, former Vice President Al Gore, one of many political leaders in attendance, called Mrs. Tucker ''a four-star general in the battle for righteousness.''         Cynthia DeLores Nottage was born in Philadelphia on Oct. 4, 1927, as the 10th of 11 children of the Rev. Whitfield Nottage and the former Captilda Gardiner. The children were raised in a strict religious atmosphere, not allowed to dance, listen to music or date until they were 21.         Because her father refused to accept pay for his pastor posts, Mrs. Tucker's mother became an entrepreneur to feed the family. She founded an employment agency for Southern blacks who migrated northward for jobs, ran a grocery store and became a landlord. When Mrs. Tucker later inherited some of those properties, political opponents accused her of being a slumlord.         She attended Temple University but did not earn a degree. Her first involvement in civil rights came when she registered black voters for a Philadelphia mayoral campaign in 1950.         The next year, she married William Tucker, a real estate executive, who is her only immediate survivor. They had no children but helped raise a number of relatives in their extended families.         In the 1960's, she campaigned for black candidates, served on the Pennsylvania Democratic Committee and earned a reputation as an excellent fund-raiser. She was the first black and the first woman elected to the Philadelphia Zoning Board. In 1971, Gov. Milton J. Shapp appointed her secretary of the commonwealth, equivalent to secretary of state in other states.         As secretary, she was a leader in instituting voter registration by mail and lowering the voting age to 18. Governor Shapp fired her in 1977 because of accusations that she used state employees to write speeches for which she was paid $66,931.         She ran unsuccessfully for Congress, lieutenant governor and the United States Senate.         Her involvement with gangsta rap began when a niece she was raising was ostracized for using foul language she had picked up from listening to the music. Music industry executives responded by suing her, and much of her later life was tangled in complicated suits and countersuits.         In 1997, she sued the estate of Mr. Shakur, who was shot to death the year before, for $10 million, alleging defamation for mentioning her in an obscene lyric. The suit was dismissed.       
         Ruth Clement Bond, an educator and civic leader who in the mid-1930's, in her first and only foray into quilt design, helped transform the American quilt from a utilitarian bedcovering into a work of avant-garde social commentary, died on Oct. 24 at her daughter's home in Manhattan. She was 101.         Her death was confirmed by her family.         Mrs. Bond was noted for a series of quilts known collectively as the T.V.A. quilts. Designed by her, the quilts were sewn in rural Alabama by the wives of African-American workers building dams there for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Visually arresting and contemporary-looking even today, the T.V.A. quilts are considered pivotal in the history of American quiltmaking.         While most quilts of the period were based on the traditional geometric and floral designs that had endured for more than a century, the T.V.A. quilts are dynamic works of modern art. Using solid-colored fabrics appliquéd onto stark backgrounds, they depict bold, stylized silhouettes of black people. With their jagged yet elegant lines, the figures have been compared to the paper cutouts of Matisse and to the work of the Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas.         Mrs. Bond, who had trained as an academic and did not know how to quilt, embarked on the project after her husband was sent to northern Alabama to supervise the black workers at the dam sites there. The Bonds lived for a time near the Wheeler Dam, in one of the segregated villages built for the workers and their families.         The women completed a half-dozen large quilts, all believed to have been made in 1934. Three are extant, as are several very small quilts, made as samples.         The T.V.A. quilts have been exhibited in New York at the Museum of Arts and Design, and elsewhere around the country. They are featured in several books, among them ''Soft Covers for Hard Times: Quiltmaking and the Great Depression'' (Rutledge Hill Press, 1990), by Merikay Waldvogel.         In later years, Mrs. Bond, whose husband joined the Foreign Service in 1944, taught at universities in Haiti, Liberia and Malawi and worked with women's and youth groups in Afghanistan, Tunisia and Sierra Leone. After returning to Washington in the 1960's, she served as president of the African-American Women's Association.         In 1978, Mrs. Bond was part of a fact-finding mission for the National Council of Negro Women that studied the role of women in Senegal, Togo and the Ivory Coast.         Ruth Elizabeth Clement was born in Louisville, Ky., on May 22, 1904, the fourth of seven children of a prominent black family. Her father, George, was a bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Her mother, the former Emma Williams, was, in 1946, the first black woman to be named American Mother of the Year.         Ruth received bachelor's and master's degrees in English literature from Northwestern University and was afterward the head of the English department at Kentucky State College.         In 1931, she married J. Max Bond and followed him to the University of Southern California, where he earned a doctorate in sociology. Mrs. Bond also started work on a Ph.D., but left after the birth of her first child. Mr. Bond later took a position with the T.V.A., becoming the highest-ranking black administrator there.         Mr. Bond died in 1991. Mrs. Bond is survived by their three children, Jane Clement Bond and J. Max Bond Jr., both of Manhattan, and George Clement Bond of Teaneck, N.J.; a sister, Emma Clement Walker, of Seattle; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         When Mrs. Bond joined her husband in Alabama, she planned to finish her doctoral studies, but there was no local university at which she could enroll. So, while her husband trained the builders, she went to work with their wives in the makeshift villages along the Tennessee River.         Many of the workers were former sharecroppers, and the dam project gave them their first real income. Almost overnight, their wives were buying pianos for their parlors. But to Mrs. Bond's consternation, they were wallpapering those parlors with the pages of the Sears catalog.         ''These country women were buying things they didn't need, yet weren't fixing up their houses,'' she said in 1992, in an oral history for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training.         Mrs. Bond started a home beautification program, helping the women make curtains from dyed feed sacks and rugs from cornhusks. Many of the women were expert quilters, and she began designing pictorial quilts that celebrated black Americans' expanded opportunities under the New Deal. Mrs. Bond cut the pattern pieces out of paper and chose the colors; the women pieced and quilted the cotton fabric.         One quilt depicts a man torn between an alluring woman, tantalizingly glimpsed at one edge of the image, and a solid government job, represented by an extended uniformed arm, at the other.         Another shows a black fist seeming to rise straight from the earth. The fist clutches a jagged red lightning bolt, symbolizing the T.V.A.'s promise of rural electrification.         The women called the quilt ''Black Power.''       
         Dorothy Law Nolte, a writer and family counselor whose ubiquitous inspirational poem, ''Children Learn What They Live,'' was photocopied, circulated, anthologized and affixed to refrigerator doors worldwide for nearly two decades before she claimed rightful authorship of it in the 1970's, died on Nov. 6 at her home in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif. She was 81.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         In 1954, Mrs. Nolte, who wrote a weekly column on family matters for The Torrance Herald, a local newspaper, found herself on deadline and strapped for material. She composed a 14-line poem on childrearing that would become a mantra for millions of parents.         The poem quickly took on a life of its own. It was copied repeatedly and passed from hand to hand. It was printed on plaques and posters. It was distributed to millions of new parents by a maker of baby formula.         Earlier this year, Crown Prince Naruhito of Japan announced that he would raise his daughter, Princess Aiko, by its tenets.         For years, the poem was widely believed to be anonymous, and Mrs. Nolte received neither credit nor compensation. Unaware that she had loosed a genie on the world, she soon forgot about it.         In 1972, after discovering how big her poem had become, Mrs. Nolte copyrighted it. In 1998, she expanded it into a book, ''Children Learn What They Live: Parenting to Inspire Values,'' written with Rachel Harris. The book has more than 3 million copies in print worldwide and has been translated into 18 languages, according to its publisher, Workman Publishing.         Mrs. Nolte and Ms. Harris also collaborated on a sequel, ''Teenagers Learn What They Live: Parenting to Inspire Integrity and Independence,'' published by Workman in 2002.         Considered timeless wisdom by some and undiluted treacle by others, Mrs. Nolte's poem is organized as a series of logical propositions:         If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn.         If children live with hostility, they learn to fight.         If children live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive.         If children live with pity, they learn to feel sorry for themselves.         But do not despair, the poem seems to say. It continues:         If children live with encouragement, they learn confidence.         If children live with tolerance, they learn patience.         If children live with praise, they learn appreciation.         If children live with acceptance, they learn to love.         The poem has time-honored antecedents in Western oral tradition. With its steady rhythm and gentle didacticism, it recalls well-loved nursery rhymes or ballads. As with much oral literature that is later written down, it circulated in a number of variant texts over the years, some longer, some shorter, some with altered language.         Mrs. Nolte herself changed the poem in later years to make it gender-neutral. (The original read, ''If a child lives with criticism, he learns to condemn,'' and so on.)         Dorothy Louise McDaniel was born in Los Angeles on Jan. 12, 1924. She held various jobs before training as a family counselor in the 1950's. In recent years, she lectured often on childrearing.         Mrs. Nolte's first marriage, to Durwood Law, ended in divorce. She married Claude Nolte in 1959. With her second husband, Mrs. Nolte wrote a book, ''Wake Up in Bed, Together! A Handbook for Sexual Repatterning'' (Stein & Day, 1975).         Mr. Nolte died in 1988. Mrs. Nolte is survived by two children from her first marriage, Joyce Jameson of Gold Canyon, Ariz., and Gerald Law of Rancho Santa Margarita; a daughter from her second marriage, Lisa Mulvania, of Huntington Beach, Calif.; a stepson, David Nolte, of Kailua, Hawaii; eight grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild.       
         Constance Cummings, a versatile American actress who lived mostly in England and, in a more glamorous age of liners and ocean crossings, captivated audiences on both sides of the Atlantic in a long stage, screen and television career, died on Wednesday in a nursing home in Oxfordshire. She was 95.         Her death was confirmed by her son, Dr. Jonathan Levy.         Starting as a teenage chorus girl in New York in 1928, Ms. Cummings appeared in several Broadway shows, caught the eye of a Hollywood mogul in 1930 and was soon playing flappers, molls and ingénues in a skein of films heavy on romance, blazing guns and sedans careening along dark roads.         From that inauspicious apprenticeship, she climbed on rungs of talent and drive to become a serious and celebrated actress in New York and London. She took on plays by Shakespeare, Sartre, Shaw, Edward Albee, Tennessee Williams and others, and with them more complex roles: vulgar women, ambitious schemers, witless socialites and victims of drugs, alcohol and stroke.         Ms. Cummings's finest performance, many critics said, was as Mary Tyrone, the frail matriarch of an Irish-American family, in the 1971 London revival of ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical tale of a dysfunctional family's day of disintegration.         Playing opposite Laurence Olivier at the National Theater, Ms. Cummings delivered a subtle and hypnotic portrayal of transformation, from a gentle maternal presence to the spectral morphine addict of the last act. Clive Barnes, in a review for The New York Times, called it ''one of the most compelling O'Neill productions I have ever seen -- terrifying in its intensity and uncompromising honesty.''         In the 1979 Broadway production of Arthur Kopit's ''Wings,'' Ms. Cummings bewitched theatergoers in the role she called the most demanding of her career: Emily Stilson, a one-time aviator and wing-walker, stricken by a cerebral hemorrhage and groping in the chaotic landscape of her broken mind.         To be in the audience, critics said, was to be inside her consciousness, lost in the silent pandemonium of the stroke. A ticking clock falters, then stops. The lamp flickers out. She sits alone in the darkness, bewildered by jumbled memories, terrifying voices. Have I crashed in a strange country? Are the doctors Romanians? Why are they talking gibberish? Why can't they understand my perfectly lucid answers? Is this a snowstorm? What is a toothbrush? Who am I?         Richard Eder, in a review for The Times, called her performance ''by far the most distinguished work to open on Broadway this season.'' Ms. Cummings shared the Tony award for best actress that year with Carole Shelley, who was cited for her role in ''The Elephant Man.''         Ms. Cummings made more than 40 American and British films, most of them in the 1930's and 40's -- a canon of romantic comedies, farces and potboilers co-starring the likes of Harold Lloyd, George Raft, Robert Young and Spencer Tracy. It was her 1945 role in the screen adaptation of Noël Coward's ''Blithe Spirit,'' with Rex Harrison, that made her an international star.         But as her dramatic range widened, she became better known for her perishable stage work than her film roles. In the 1950's and 60's, she made only eight movies, but performed in scores of plays on Broadway, in the West End and at the National Theater in London, and elsewhere in Britain and Europe.         In London, she was in Joseph Kramm's ''Shrike'' (1953), with Sam Wanamaker; Clifford Odets's ''Winter Journey'' (1952), with Michael Redgrave; Aristophanes' ''Lysistrata'' (1957); Sartre's ''Huis Clos'' (''No Exit,'' 1962); Max Beerbohm's ''Social Success'' (1962); and as Martha, the alcoholic campus wife, in Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' (1964).         In her twilight years, Ms. Cummings appeared in revivals of ''The Chalk Garden'' in New York and ''Mrs. Warren's Profession'' in Vienna, both in 1982; in a 1983 television version of ''Wings,'' filmed for the American Playhouse series on PBS; and in a London production of ''The Glass Menagerie'' in 1985. Her last television movie was ''Dead Man's Folly,'' an Agatha Christie mystery with Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot, on CBS in 1986. Her West End finale was in ''Uncle Vanya,'' in 1999.         Constance Cummings was born Constance Halverstadt -- she took her mother's maiden name professionally -- in Seattle on May 15, 1910, the daughter of a lawyer and a concert soprano. She was stage-struck early, studied classical dancing and performed in summer stock at 16. Two years later, accompanied by her mother, she went to New York, where she got into the chorus line of a Broadway musical.         By 1930, she had caught the eye of Samuel Goldwyn, and went to Hollywood to co-star with Ronald Coleman in ''The Devil to Pay.'' Unexpectedly replaced by Loretta Young, she jumped to Columbia and made her first film, ''The Criminal Code,'' in 1931, with Walter Huston. She appeared in 21 more movies over the next four years, most notably ''Movie Crazy,'' with Harold Lloyd.         In Hollywood, she met the British playwright and director Benn W. Levy, who was there to do a script. They were married in 1933 and settled in London a year later. She had to win a court fight with Columbia to make movies in Britain. But by 1935, she was one of the most sought after film stars on either side of the Atlantic. She also began appearing on the stage again, in London and New York.         Many of her plays in the 1940's and 50's were written or directed by her husband, who became a Labor member of Parliament after World War II and a prominent campaigner for nuclear disarmament.         In her heyday, Ms. Cummings cut a glamorous figure, a gray-eyed, auburn-haired beauty toasted in Hollywood, New York and London. Her trans-Atlantic sailings made little items in the newspapers.         In 1974, Ms. Cummings was named a Commander of the British Empire for her contributions to entertainment. She had spent so many years in England -- living in London and on a 600-acre farm in Oxfordshire -- and spoke British English with so slight an accent that many Americans assumed she was British. Her husband died in 1973. In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Jemima Levy. Both live in Oxford.         Correction:  November 30, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary yesterday about Constance Cummings, a stage and screen actress, misspelled the surname of the co-star of the film ''The Devil to Pay!'' (1930), in which she was replaced by Loretta Young. He was Ronald Colman, not Coleman.       
         Katharine Sergava, a dancer and actress who portrayed Laurey in Agnes de Mille's dream ballet in the original Broadway production of ''Oklahoma!,'' died on Nov. 26 at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 or 96.         Her death was reported yesterday by a longtime friend, Ann Berlin. An erroneous report of Ms. Sergava's death appeared in The New York Times on Dec. 4, 2003.         Ms. Sergava was born in Tiflis (now Tblisi) in Georgia on July 30, 1909 or 1910 (she gave both dates). She fled Russia with her family during the Revolution and settled for a time in London. She studied drama and ballet in London and Paris and later emigrated to the United States.         In New York, she danced with the Mordkin Ballet, Ballet Theater, now known as American Ballet Theater, and the Original Ballet Russe, as Col. W. de Basil's Ballet Russe then called itself.         She danced the part of Laurey from the opening of ''Oklahoma!'' in 1943 until 1947. She was then cast in ''Look Ma, I'm Dancing,'' choreographed by Jerome Robbins. In 1956, she took over Lotte Lenya's role in ''The Threepenny Opera.''         She also appeared in a variety of plays, including ''Dial M for Murder'' and Jean Cocteau's ''The Typewriter,'' and she toured in Shaw's ''Misalliance.'' She taught drama at HB Studios in New York for more than 30 years.         Her husband, Bernard Sznycer, died in 1970. She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Débora Arango, a prolific artist who at first repelled socially conservative Colombia with stark paintings of nudes and social conflict but who was later celebrated as one of the country's most inventive, daring artists, died on Dec. 4 at her rambling colonial home outside Medellín. She was 98.         Her death was confirmed by a great-nephew, Pedro Miguel Estrada.         In a career that began nearly 80 years ago and lasted until late in life, Ms. Arango produced countless works that often depicted the hurdles and indignities she found in being a woman in a strict Roman Catholic country. She made dramatic paintings of prostitutes, which shocked midcentury sensibilities, and one of a woman giving birth in prison.         Though a product of a traditional, affluent family from the Antioquia province of Colombia, Ms. Arango produced work that pushed the bounds of decorum, vividly touching on delicate and troubling subjects like Colombia's political violence, poverty and brutality. In her work, she depicted a 1950's-era Colombian dictator, Gen. Gustavo Rojas Pinilla, as a toad, and portrayed a military junta as five monkeys wrapped in Colombia's flag.         Ms. Arango always pushed boundaries, even as a young girl. In a favorite story, she talked about how she wore pants to ride horses, unheard of in her time, and about how her father permitted her to drive the family car.         ''In those times in Medellín, there were three women who drove: a foreigner, the daughter of a trucker and me,'' she said.         One of 12 children, Ms. Arango first studied art at 13 at the rigid Catholic school she attended in Medellín and later at the city's Instituto de Bellas Artes. In 1935, she began working with Pedro Nel Gómez, a well-known artist who painted murals that portrayed the powerful and influential of Colombian society.         Despite living amid anti-reform movements, Ms. Arango began to capture social issues in her work, as well as the female body, which she often depicted as corpulent and wrinkled.         Ms. Arango first caused a public stir in 1939 when she exhibited in Antioquia with established male artists. In 1940, after an exhibition in Bogotá, the newspaper El Siglo said of her works, ''They constitute a true attack against the culture and artistic tradition of our capital city.'' Ms. Arango's work also came under assault in Spain in 1955, when the dictator Francisco Franco closed an exhibition of her paintings.         Ms. Arango, like the better-known Mexican painter Frida Kahlo, was inspired by the muralist movement of Mexico, which captured Latin America's roiling history in epic proportions. She never became a muralist, but she did paint large, trying to hammer her message with broad, thick brushstrokes. Her subjects inhabited the seamy side of small-town life: drunken men leaving a bar, a woman roughed up by policemen, an emaciated child in a mother's arms.         ''She did it with brazen language,'' Fernando Botero, Colombia's most renowned artist, said of Ms. Arango's message in a telephone interview from his studio in Paris. ''She was not preoccupied with aesthetics. What was central was expressing herself.''         Her paintings also tackled subjects that in an isolated, provincial country in the 1940's and 50's were best left alone. What she saw as hypocrisy in the church became an important subject for her. In one famous painting, Ms. Arango portrayed a group of nuns circling a caged bird, a cardinal. In another, a boxcar is filled with bodies, a reminder of the relentless political violence that has marked Colombia for decades. Ms. Arango often focused on race and poverty, as well as on corrupt leaders.         ''She was capable of condemning,'' said Alberto Sierra, curator of the Museum of Antioquia in Medellín and an expert on Ms. Arango's work. ''Politically, Débora was a voice of protest as things were unfolding. A lot of artists wait and portray events after they happened.''         As Colombia opened itself up to the world and produced celebrated artists like Mr. Botero and writers like Gabriel García Márquez, Ms. Arango's work eventually found acceptance and critical acclaim.         Though her art has been exhibited in Madrid and the United States, Ms. Arango never sought fame and was reluctant to have her paintings shown. Still, in Colombia art books feature her work, and the Museum of Modern Art in Medellín boasts of the 233 pieces she donated in 1986.         In old age, she continued to work, her paintings climbing the walls of her beloved house in the town of Envigado. She delighted in having visitors, surprising them with her sharp wit.         When one asked her about her relationships with men, whom Ms. Arango's art often portrayed in a less-than-positive light, she said, ''Men never thought much of me, and I never thought much of them, either.''         Her diminishing skills forced her to give up painting in the last year or two of her life. In 2003, shortly before receiving the Cruz de Boyacá, Colombia's most important honor, she recognized the inevitable.         ''There is so much to paint, but the tears come to my eyes and I cannot do it like I would like,'' she said. ''I was very bold, but you start to wear down with the years.''       
         Margretta Madden Styles, a nursing educator who conceived and helped establish precise national standards for certifying nurses in pediatrics, cardiology and other medical specialties, died on Nov. 20 at her home in Clearwater, Fla. She was 75.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         It was in the 1970's that Dr. Styles and others began to press for stricter certification of nurses and a rational system to regulate them. She lectured and wrote on the subject in nursing journals, contributing articles on advanced nursing practices and ways to determine criteria for issuing sound credentials.         In the 1980's she helped found the American Nurses Credentialing Center, which now administers testing for more than 20 medical specialties and, said Catherine L. Gilliss, dean of the Duke University School of Nursing, ''helped to standardize across the nation just what to expect from your nurse.''         The center is the credentialing arm of the American Nurses Association, which represents 150,000 nurses and nurse specialists. Dr. Styles served as the association's president from 1986 to 1988.         Later in her career she studied the emerging importance of trained nurses in developing countries and, in 1993, was elected president of the International Council of Nurses.         She continued to write on certification and helped edit a popular anthology, ''On Nursing: A Literary Celebration'' (1993), which ''framed the art of healing, the pain of suffering, and was received as a gift to the profession,'' said Barbara A. Blakeney, the current president of the American Nurses Association.         Margretta Madden was born in Mount Union, Pa., and earned an undergraduate degree from Juniata College, a master's from Yale and a doctorate in education from the University of Florida.         She worked as a staff nurse in hospitals before becoming an associate professor of nursing at Duke in 1967. She was dean of nursing at the University of Texas at San Antonio; then at Wayne State University, in Detroit; and finally at the University of California, San Francisco.         Dr. Styles's husband of 47 years, the Rev. Douglas Styles, an Episcopal priest, died in 2002.         She is survived by two sons, Michael, of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Patrick, of Redmond, Wash.; a daughter, Megan Styles of Danville, Calif.; a brother, Joseph Madden of Indian Rocks, Fla.; a sister, Jane Rupp of St. Petersburg; and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Aiken Littauer, whose love affair with horses began with a childhood pony, blossomed with her marriage to an officer in the cavalry of Czar Nicholas II, and flowered famously when she became a leading expert on horses of ancient times, died on Dec. 7 at her home in Syosset, N.Y. She was 93.         Her son, Andrew, announced the death.         Mrs. Littauer's scholarly career did not begin until her mid-50's, when her husband's health would no longer permit him to maintain his standards of horsemanship. The standards were high indeed: Vladimir S. Littauer was the author of eight books on riding and training horses, and his instructional techniques are still used.         Not wanting to ride alone, Mrs. Littauer was restless. Her husband suggested she write a book about horses.         She had had no college education, but decided to start at the beginning. By bringing her keen intelligence and considerable horse sense to archaeological discoveries, she would write about when and how horses and men got together. Her first article, ''The Function of the Yoke Saddle in Ancient Harnessing,'' appeared in the British journal Antiquity in 1968.         The same year, Mrs. Littauer was introduced to Joost Crouwel, who had just earned a degree in classical archaeology from the University of Amsterdam and was beginning his doctoral thesis on Mycenaean chariots. A collaboration of three decades began.         Dr. Crouwel became professor of Aegean archaeology at the University of Amsterdam. Mrs. Littauer gained fame as the Grande Dame of the study of horses.         The two wrote about 65 articles for academic journals, usually with each other though sometimes with other scholars and sometimes individually. A typical title: ''The Earliest Evidence for Metal Bridle Parts.''         They wrote two books, ''Wheeled Vehicles and Ridden Animals in the Ancient Near East'' (1970) and ''Chariots and Related Equipment from the Tomb of Tutankhamen'' (1985). Both became standard reference works.         ''They have set international standards that will last for many years,'' said Peter Raulvig, an archaeologist and linguist who also studied chariots.         In 2002, Mrs. Littauer and Dr. Crouwel published a collection titled ''Selected Writing on Chariots and Other Early Vehicles, Riding and Harness.''         An example of Mrs. Littauer's analysis was her article in 1983 in La Recherche, a French counterpart of Scientific American, in which she rejected earlier assertions that the first wheels were used on two-wheeled carts. Instead, she argued, the first real wheel was on a crude four-wheel vehicle. She theorized that soft sands in the Middle East would have made a two-wheeled precursor of the chariot impractical, and pointed to the four-wheeled carriages discovered by Sir Leonard Woolley in the so-called King's Tomb in Ur, a Sumerian city that flourished in Lower Mesopotamia (now Iraq) about 4,500 years ago.         But she disputed Sir Leonard's contention that the vehicles were the ''tanks'' of antiquity. The reason was that the harness used was highly vulnerable to projectiles, not to mention the vehicle's occupants, The New York Times reported in 1983.         Her ability to interpret evidence found by others became legendary. She once pointed out that an ancient horse's bit displayed in the British Museum was upside down. Embarrassed curators corrected the error.         Mary Aiken Graver was born in Pittsburgh on Feb. 11, 1912, and grew up in Manhattan. Her formal education ended when she graduated from what is now the Spence School. Her interest in horses dates from her ownership of a cow pony in Nevada, where her family vacationed.         As a young woman, she was a volunteer courier in the Frontier Nursing Service, which provided health care in rural Kentucky. For young society women, the chance to ride horses for many miles over roadless, mountainous terrain in a good cause was grand adventure. She was once caught in the middle of a shooting battle between feuding families.         Mr. Littauer founded a riding academy called the Boots and Saddles Club, and also taught private clients at the family's Long Island home before his death in 1989, at 96. In addition to their son, of Princeton, N.J., Mrs. Littauer is survived by two grandsons.         Already fluent in French, Mrs. Littauer taught herself ancient Greek, German and Russian. Scholars sent her their research results, commentaries and papers to edit.         Mary B. Moore, an art historian at Hunter College specializing in ancient Greece, said that Mrs. Littauer advised colleagues on how an ancient bit or bridle was probably used, or on where the driver would have stood on a chariot. Dr. Moore said those suggestions were utterly practical, and seldom theoretical or aesthetic.         She said that Mrs. Littauer seldom went to archaeological digs, because of her age. ''Sitting around a ditch all day wouldn't have been one of those things she would go for.''         She was nonetheless famously observant. In a paper on the Roman use of horses, Judith A. Walker, an archaeologist, mentioned a chariot and harness found in an ancient tomb.         ''No one person has spent more time studying, reconstructing and analyzing this harness and chariot than Mary Littauer,'' she wrote.         Mrs. Littauer embodied skepticism, as when what appeared to be wheels of chariots were found on the Russian steppes. In an article in The New York Times in 1994, she cautioned, ''A spoked wheel is not necessarily a chariot, only a light car on the way to becoming a chariot.''         On rare occasions, Mrs. Littauer ventured beyond the ancient world, with an interest as modern as the horses of medieval knights.       
         Selma Jeanne Cohen, a historian, editor and teacher who devoted her career to proclaiming dance an art worthy of the same scholarly respect traditionally awarded to painting, music and literature, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 85.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, said Leslie Steinau, her lawyer and a longtime friend.         Ms. Cohen waged a tireless campaign against scholars who maintained that dance was inherently frivolous. Instead, she believed it had a rich history that could be fruitfully analyzed from many philosophical viewpoints. Her efforts led her to become America's leading figure in dance scholarship.         Her most ambitious achievement was her editing of The International Encyclopedia of Dance for Oxford University Press. Published in 1998 after two decades of planning, and encompassing all forms of dance, the six-volume work, modeled on The New Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians, remains the most comprehensive guide of its kind.         Eclectic scholarly interests had prompted Ms. Cohen, A. J.Pischl and Sheppard Black in 1959 to found Dance Perspectives, a journal dedicated to monographs on various aspects of world dance. Ms. Cohen became its sole editor in 1966. After it ceased publication in 1976, the Dance Perspectives Foundation, which she had established, continued to award an annual prize for the best dance book of the year.         Ms. Cohen was born in Chicago, attended elementary and high school at the University of Chicago Laboratory School and went on to the university itself, receiving a Ph.D. in English in 1946.         When a childhood friend started taking ballet lessons from Edna McRae, a respected Chicago teacher, Ms. Cohen went along. Ms. Cohen soon realized she had no dancing talent. But she had great curiosity, and McRae had a dance library, which Ms. Cohen devoured.         She began teaching English at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1946 and, at the same time, worked with the Los Angeles teacher and choreographer Eugene Loring. After moving to New York in 1953, she devoted herself to dance and started reviewing for Dance Observer. From 1955 to 1958 she was a dance critic at The New York Times, where she assisted John Martin, who was chief dance critic. She was dance critic for The Saturday Review in 1965 and 1966.         Ms. Cohen was a member of the first National Endowment for the Arts Dance Panel in 1966; organized a critics' conference at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn., in 1970; and taught over the years at many colleges, including the University of Chicago, where she returned to head summer seminars from 1974 to 1976. Ms. Cohen wrote and edited several important books, among them ''The Modern Dance: Seven Statements of Belief'' (Wesleyan University Press, 1966), an anthology of essays by contemporary choreographers; ''Doris Humphrey: An Artist First'' (Wesleyan, 1972), a biography of a pioneering modern dancer; and ''Next Week, Swan Lake'' (Wesleyan, 1982), a study of dance aesthetics. Her ''Dance as a Theater Art'' (Dodd, Mead, 1974), a history of dance since the Renaissance, remains a popular college text.         Ms. Cohen, a tiny soft-spoken woman, could be a rigorous teacher, but she delighted in presiding graciously over social events. Friends, colleagues and students often met informally at her apartment, gatherings usually graced by Giselle, her long-lived and much-pampered cat. Ms. Cohen often jokingly said she hoped to write a treatise on feline aesthetics someday.         No immediate family members survive.
