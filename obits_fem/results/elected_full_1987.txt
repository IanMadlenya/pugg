A memorial service will be held at 10 A.M. Monday in the Cathedral Church of St. John the Divine in Manhattan for the Rev. Mother Ruth, founder and headmistress of St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's Episcopal day school. The Reverend Mother, who died Dec. 22 after a brief illness, was 89 years old.         The Reverend Mother, a native New Yorker, was born Ruth Elaine Younger. She entered the Canadian Sisterhood of St. John the Divine in Toronto and took her final vows in 1922. She was a graduate of St. Hilda's College, University of Toronto, and earned a master's degree and a doctorate in education from Columbia University.         She and a colleague, Sister Edith Margaret, founded St. Hilda's School in Morningside Heights in 1950. It later became St. Hilda's and St. Hugh's School, which offered coeducational academic training from nursery through the 12th grade. She was its headmistress until her retirement in 1985.         In 1952, she was elected the Reverend Mother of the Community of the Holy Spirit, an Episcopal religious order for women that she founded that year. Under her direction, the group also founded the Melrose School in Brewster, N.Y., and St. Cuthbert's Retreat House.       
        Septima Poinsette Clark, a teacher who had been active in civil rights activities since World War I, died Tuesday at a nursing home on John's Island. She was 89 years old.  Born in Charleston, the daughter of a former slave, Mrs. Clark was widely recognized for her work in civil rights. In 1964 she accompanied the Rev.         Septima Poinsette Clark, a teacher who had been active in civil rights activities since World War I, died Tuesday at a nursing home on John's Island. She was 89 years old.  Born in Charleston, the daughter of a former slave, Mrs. Clark was widely recognized for her work in civil rights. In 1964 she accompanied the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Norway when he was presented the Nobel Peace Prize.         ''The state has lost not only a leading civil rights activist but a legendary educator and humanitarian,'' Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. said today.         Mrs. Clark attended Avery Institute in Charleston, and received a bachelor's degree from Benedict College in Columbia and a master's degree from Hampton Institute in Virginia. Worked in Teacher Campaign         She began her teaching career at a black public school on John's Island and, in 1918, accepted a teaching post at Avery. That year, she was instrumental in getting about 20,000 signatures on a petition to have black teachers hired by the Charleston County School District.         Mrs. Clark moved to Columbia in 1927 to teach and helped in a campaign to equalize teacher salaries.         She later was dismissed from a teaching job in Charleston for being a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         In the late 1950's she worked at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, where she developed a program to teach blacks to read and write well enough to pass voter literacy tests. She lectured around the country and later became a director of the school and a supervisor of teacher training for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.         Her autobiography, ''Echo In My Soul,'' was published in 1962.         In 1974, Mrs. Clark was elected to the Charleston County School Board.         Mrs. Clark received a Living Legacy Award from President Carter in 1979 and the Order of the Palmetto, South Carolina's highest civilian award, in 1982.         She is survived by a son, Nerie D. Clark Jr., of Hickory, N.C., a sister and two brothers.       
        Representative Sala Burton, a California Democrat who succeeded her late husband in Congress in 1983 and carried on his liberal policies, died today of complications arising from cancer. She was 61.         Representative Sala Burton, a California Democrat who succeeded her late husband in Congress in 1983 and carried on his liberal policies, died today of complications arising from cancer. She was 61.         Tom Schulz, a nephew of Mrs. Burton, said she died at 8:22 P.M. at the George Washington University Hospital here.         ''Mrs. Burton, recently hospitalized for further treatment and recuperation from cancer surgery, experienced a sudden decline this weekend after an apparent stabilization of her illness,'' Mr. Schulz said.  Mrs. Burton underwent surgery for colon cancer surgery in August. Her last public appearance was on Dec. 9. Swearing-in Was Delayed         Mrs. Burton arrived at her Congressional office for the opening day of Congress on Jan. 6, after insisting that she would appear. However, later in the day she became ill and was forced to leave before the swearing-in ceremonies of the 100th Congress.         The House passed a resolution allowing her to be sworn-in at home, and the oath was administered Jan. 7 by the chairman of the California delegation, Don Edwards, also a Democrat.         ''She took the oath, signed all the papers, and gave me a bottle of champagne,'' Mr. Edwards said. Mrs. Burton entered the George Washington University Hospital the next day. Re-elected in 1984 and 1986         Mrs. Burton, who represented a large portion of San Francisco, was a member of the House Rules Committee. She was elected in 1983 to complete the term of her husband, Phillip, and was re-elected in 1984 and 1986.         Although Phillip Burton was one of Congress' leading liberals, his widow traced her interest in politics to her teen-age years, when she and her parents fled Poland ahead of the Nazi occupation forces.         ''I saw and felt what happened in Western Europe when the Nazis were moving,'' she once said. ''You learn that politics is everybody's business.''         Politics was her business most of the time after she met her husband in 1950 at a convention of the California Young Democrats. 'She Astounded Everybody'         Phillip Burton spent nearly two decades in Congress and championed his liberal causes with a brash style.         ''Phil was so overwhelming he would just take over when he walked into a room,'' Mr. Edwards recalled recently. ''It tended to put her in the role as a shy wife. But she was operating all the time.         ''When Phil died, she astounded everybody,'' he said. ''First, she was on the Education and Labor Committee.'' When she got on Rules, she was among the very strongest members for national Democratic Party policies. She was an advocate for poor people, education, the environment, and arms reduction. She was a pillar of strength. She didn't give an inch.'' When she returned to the House after her operation last year, Mrs. Burton was welcomed back with a speech by Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., then Speaker of the House. Democratic Party Activities         In the 1950's Mrs. Burton helped organize the California Democratic Council and served as its vice president. She was a delegate to three national Democratic Party conventions.         She also worked closely with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to end discrimination in employment and housing.         From 1972 through 1974, she was president of the Democratic Wives of the House and Senate. She was legislative chairman of the Women's National Democratic Club and its liaison to the House.         Friends said she viewed her job of representing three-quarters of San Francisco's 678,000 residents as a family legacy. After winning the seat, she moved into offices at a Federal building in San Francisco that had been renamed for her husband.         REPRESENTATIVE SALA BURTON, 61

        Nelda S. Freeman, a former managing editor and board member of W. W. Norton & Company, the book publisher, died of cancer Saturday at the Northern Westchester Medical Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 72 years old and lived in Brewster, N.Y.         Nelda S. Freeman, a former managing editor and board member of W. W. Norton & Company, the book publisher, died of cancer Saturday at the Northern Westchester Medical Center in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 72 years old and lived in Brewster, N.Y.         Mrs. Freeman joined Norton in 1940 as assistant to Robert E. Farlow, head of production and art director. She became managing editor in 1963.         Mrs. Freeman was elected to the board of directors in June 1972. She was the purchaser of paper for all Norton books until her retirement in 1984.         She was born in Russellville, Mo., and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1937.         Surviving are her husband, Andrew; a daughter, Melinda, of Brewster; a stepson, Roger, of Sudbury, Mass., and a sister, Marguerite Britter, also of Brewster.       
        Lieut. Gov. Ruth Meiers, the first woman to serve in that post in North Dakota, died Thursday. She was 61 years old.         Lieut. Gov. Ruth Meiers, the first woman to serve in that post in North Dakota, died Thursday. She was 61 years old.         Gov. George Sinner said Mrs. Meiers died of ''complications due to cancer.'' Doctors found cancer in her brain and lung last September.         ''We and the whole state have lost a wonderful friend and leader,'' Mr. Sinner said. ''We will miss her dearly. All of us are better because of her.''         An aide said the Governor had no immediate plans to to appoint a replacement.         Mrs. Meiers, who had earlier taken radiation and chemotherapy treatment as an outpatient, was forced back into the hospital last week.         ''I believe in prayer,'' Mrs. Meiers said after the diaognosis. ''I believe in miracles. I also believe in reality, and I can deal with that.''         Mrs. Meiers, a former Democratic member of the North Dakota House, was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1984. She had been drafted by the Democratic women's caucus at the party convention to be Mr. Sinners's running mate.         She was elected to the House in 1974, following her father, Axel Olson, to the Legislature.         Mrs. Meiers worked as a child welfare worker and director of the Mountrail County Welfare Board.         While serving as Lieutenant Governor, Mrs. Meiers commuted each weekend from Bismarck to the farm and ranch she and her husband, Glenn, own 150 miles northwest of Bismarck.         Besides her husband, survivors include four sons and a foster son.       
        Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Born in the Clasons Point section of the East Bronx, she held the borough's at-large seat on the Council for more than 17 years. A Democrat, she had been a teacher in the city's school system and had served three and a half terms in the State Legislature before her election to the Council in 1965.         Her political career, which ended in 1983 when the at-large Council seats were abolished, was devoted largely to education and consumer causes. At budget time she often tangled with the Koch administration over what she considered to be meager funds for the public libraries. Author of Food Laws         Her legislative triumphs included the sponsorship of a law to require dairies to place dates on their milk cartons. Another law she sponsored mandated that supermarkets must list unit prices as well as package prices.         As chairwoman of the Council's General Welfare Committee, she was at the center of some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's. She was chairwoman of a series of long public hearings on proposals to require all-male private clubs to admit women.         Her position on measures that sought to guarantee the civil rights of the city's homosexuals was equivocal at times, but her handling of the issue enhanced her reputation as a skilled parliamentarian. In 1978 she scheduled hearings on the rights bill the day after the November election, leading to accusations by proponents of the bill that she had chosen a day when the public and news media would be absorbed in other matters.         On another crucial occasion the bill was stalled in the Welfare Committee when she failed to return from lunch for an important vote, even though supporters of the bill were counting on her vote. Elected to Assembly         Mrs. Ryan went into politics after her husband, E. Gerard Ryan, a lawyer, died. Only a handful of women had served in the New York State Assembly when she was elected to the Legislature in 1958.         She was active in Bronx politics in her 10 years as a teacher, and she was a former vice president of the Siwanoy Democratic Club, now defunct. She was a charter member of the Bronx Historical Society and a member of the League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Ryan was also a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Business and Professional Women's Club of New York and the Order of Our Lady of the Holy Sepulchre.         Born Aileen Barlow, she attended Public School 47 in the Bronx, Cathederal High School, Hunter College and the New York University Law School. Manhattan College awarded an honorary doctorate to her in 1974.         She was a lifelong resident of the Bronx until she moved to Point Lookout, L.I., about two years ago.         She is survived by two sons, Gerald Ryan of Rockville Centre, L.I., and Francis X. Ryan of Muttontown, L.I.; a daughter, Allana Chesney of Point Lookout, and three grandchildren.         A wake will be held today and tomorrow from 2 to 5 P.M. and from 7 to 9 P.M. at O'Shea's Funeral Home in Wantagh, L.I. A funeral mass is scheduled for 10:30 A.M. Wednesday at St. Helena's Roman Catholic Church in the Bronx.       
        Lucille Mason Rose, a former New York City Deputy Mayor, died after a heart attack Saturday in Brookdale Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.         Lucille Mason Rose, a former New York City Deputy Mayor, died after a heart attack Saturday in Brookdale Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.         ''A middle-aged energetic woman who thinks she knows where she's going'' is the way Mrs. Rose described herself 10 years ago, shortly before Mayor Abraham D. Beame appointed her a Deputy Mayor. She was the first woman to hold such a job.         Mrs. Rose, whose style reflected her youth in Virginia and Brooklyn, moved through a variety of managerial jobs related to labor.         ''I've gone step by step,'' Mrs. Rose said in 1977. ''They haven't let me skip a step.''         The first step was a job as a fiscal clerk in the Department of Social Services, which in 1949 paid $1,860 a year.         After earning a degree in economics from Brooklyn College in 1963, she was named director of the Bedford-Stuyvesant field office of the city's Department of Labor. Her responsibilities were gradually expanded, and in 1970 Mayor John V. Lindsay named her first deputy commissioner of the city Manpower and Career Development Agency.         In 1972, she became Commissioner of the Department of Employment. While she was in charge of that agency, its budget grew from $55 million to $300 million.         Mrs. Rose was born in Richmond on Sept. 27, 1920. Her family moved to Brooklyn when she was 7 years old, and her mother and father opened the Mason Dining Room at the corner of Fulton Street and Albany Avenue.         After her father died, her mother operated the 12-table restaurant by herself. Mrs. Rose's mother also made dresses in the evening to support the family. ''My mother didn't believe in welfare,'' Mrs. Rose recalled in 1972.         Mrs. Rose often left school to help serve the lunchtime crowd at the restaurant. She attended Public School 3 and was graduated from Girls High School in 1937.         During World War II, she worked as a welder in the construction of the battleship Missouri.         Mrs. Rose was the first woman president of the Catholic Interracial Council. She also held posts in other civic and political organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; the National Democratic Committee; the Salvation Army Advisory Committee, and St. Mary's Hospital. She was recently elected president of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn chapter of the Lioness Club.         She is survived by a son, Cornelius.       
        Eleanor Poynter Jamison, a former Indiana newspaper publisher, died Tuesday. She was 86 years old.         Eleanor Poynter Jamison, a former Indiana newspaper publisher, died Tuesday. She was 86 years old.         For more than 30 years, Mrs. Jamison was the publisher of The Sullivan Daily Times and three weekly newspapers. In 1959 she became the first woman to be elected president of the Indiana Democratic Editorial Association, and she was the first woman on the board of directors of the Hoosier State Press Association.
