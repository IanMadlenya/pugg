         Françoise Giroud, a widely admired French journalist who co-founded the political weekly L'Express and later served as France's first minister of women's affairs, died Sunday in the American Hospital of Paris. She was 86.         Her daughter said the cause of death was head injuries suffered when she fell last week.         Ms. Giroud was a slim, elegant woman known for both her charming manner and her piercing commentaries on France, the status of women and life in general. She continued working until just days ago, writing a weekly column in Le Nouvel Observateur, serving on the jury of a leading literary prize and appearing frequently on television.         Ms. Giroud was not a militant feminist in the manner of, say, Simone de Beauvoir but, as both a pioneering journalist and editor and as a cabinet minister, she served as a role model for two generations of French women seeking a more prominent role in French society. She made a particular point of encouraging young women in journalism.         While women are now highly visible in both news organizations and politics, though, she also recognized that sexual equality did not yet exist in France. In a 1996 interview, she noted: ''It's an illusion to believe that, because there are women ministers, women play a role in public affairs. There have been enormous changes, positive changes, but women still have a long way to go.''         Born in Geneva on Sept. 21, 1916, to parents of mixed Russian and Turkish extraction, France Gourdji -- as she was then called -- began working at 16 as a stenographer and then became a script-girl for several French movie directors, including Marc Allégret and Jean Renoir. During World War II, she worked as a go-between for the French Resistance, but was arrested by the Gestapo in 1943 and imprisoned at Fresnes until liberation the following year.         After the war, she began her journalistic career in the monthly magazine Elle, rising quickly to the position of news editor. Then, in 1953, with Jean-Jacques Servan-Shreiber, she founded L'Express, France's first American-style news weekly, and served as its news editor and later as editor. One measure of its influence is that the founding editors of its two competitors today, Le Nouvel Observateur and Le Point, came from L'Express.         During the 1950's, Ms. Giroud was married briefly and had two children. She is survived by her daughter, Caroline Eliacheff.         In 1974, during the center-right presidency of Valéry Giscard d'Estaing, she was named to the new post of minister of women's affairs by Jacques Chirac, who was prime minister at the time. She moved to the culture minister's job and held it until the following year.         In 1981, her own political views moved to the left: rather than backing either Mr. Giscard d'Estaing or Mr. Chirac, she endorsed the Socialist candidate, François Mitterrand, in his successful effort to win the presidency.         Ms. Giroud never returned to politics, but her weight as a commentator gave her considerable political influence. She also became a prolific author of biographies, including those of Marie Curie and Alma Mahler, and of books of political and personal reflection. In one of her first, ''The Comedy of Power'' (1977), she recounted her experience in government. In 1997, she published her autobiography and, in 2001, a collection of essays, ''Profession Journalist.''         Only one of her books, ''Si Je Mens,'' was published in the United States, in 1974, as ''I Give You My Word'' (Harcourt), but it is no longer in print.         Her books had a loyal readership in France, not least because they were packed with well-aimed commentaries on life.         ''God, how the French love rules,'' she noted in one book, ''The Rumor of the World.'' ''They put them everywhere, even where they have no place: in literature.''         In ''Journal of a Parisian,'' she offered, ''Indifference is an ailment of the spirit and the heart.'' In the same book, she concluded: ''Youth is short. It is life that is long.''       
         Jean Kerr, whose wry wit and unerring eye for life's everyday absurdities kept legions of readers and theatergoers laughing with books like ''Please Don't Eat the Daisies'' and plays like ''Mary, Mary,'' died on Sunday in White Plains. She was 80.         The apparent cause was pneumonia, her son Christopher said. She was in White Plains Hospital and lived nearby in Larchmont, N.Y., also in Westchester County.         Mrs. Kerr, who was the widow of the drama critic Walter Kerr, was well acquainted with the glamour, grit and egocentric follies of life in the theater and capitalized on that experience. She wrote entertainingly and often about show business, musing about what to say when lunching with a prospective producer (order a drink, so you look relaxed, but don't touch it lest he think you're an alcoholic), or gloomily anticipating negative reviews of her latest work (''If I have to commit suicide, I have nothing but Gelusil'').         But she also had an unquestioned gift for finding the comic in the commonplace anxieties of suburbia and married life. She cheerfully acknowledged doing most of her writing in the family car, parked several blocks away from the scrambling chaos of several children and pets (''There is nothing to do but write, after I get the glove compartment tidied up'').         The Kerrs made their debut as a team on Broadway in 1946 with ''Song of Bernadette,'' a dramatization of Franz Werfel's novel about a young Frenchwoman who was canonized after saying she had seen visions of the Virgin Mary in a grotto near Lourdes. It was not a success, nor was her solo writing effort two years later, a comedy called ''Jenny Kissed Me,'' about a priest who finds his household disrupted by the arrival of his housekeeper's niece.         Jean and Walter Kerr teamed up again in 1949 with ''Touch and Go,'' a revue for which they wrote the sketches and lyrics and which Mr. Kerr directed. The show was a hit, with sketches ranging from ''Hamlet'' performed as a musical comedy to a location rehearsal for a film sequence in which one of the characters, a trained ape, turns out to be smarter than the glamorous actress who is the star of the film. Brooks Atkinson, writing in The New York Times,praised the Kerrs' ''breezy and informed wit'' and hailed the show as the best of the season.         After contributing some sketches to another revue, ''John Murray Anderson's Almanac,'' in 1953, Mrs. Kerr joined forces to write ''King of Hearts'' with Eleanor Brooke. Starring Donald Cooke, Jackie Cooper and Cloris Leachman, and staged by Mr. Kerr, the 1954 comedy about a comic-strip artist and his love-struck secretary was well received.         Mrs. Kerr scored her first big success outside the theater with the publication in 1957 of ''Please Don't Eat the Daisies,'' a witty and wide-ranging collection of pieces about everything from the pet dogs in her life to the oddities of the Kerrs' house in Larchmont, which boasted a two-story fireplace and a carillon that played the duet from ''Carmen.'' The book became a best seller and then a movie in 1960, with David Niven and Doris Day. It became a television situation comedy as well, and ran on NBC from 1965 to 1967.         The Kerrs returned to Broadway in 1958 with their musical comedy ''Goldilocks,'' staged by Mr. Kerr, with music by Leroy Anderson, lyrics by the Kerrs and Joan Ford, and choreography by Agnes de Mille. The show closed after a mercifully brief run, and the Kerrs made a mutual vow never to mention its name again.         Mrs. Kerr went on to take Broadway by storm in 1961 with ''Mary, Mary,'' a comedy about a divorced couple who seem headed for new and misguided relationships until they discover that they still love each other. Barbara Bel Geddes played the title character, Barry Nelson her stubbornly obtuse former spouse, with Betsy von Furstenberg and Michael Rennie as the handsome troublemakers. The Times's critic, Howard Taubman, gave the show a mixed review.         Nevertheless, audiences packed the theater nightly and ''Mary, Mary'' became one of the longest-running productions of the decade. Its 1963 screen adaptation, was directed by Mervyn LeRoy with Debbie Reynolds and Barry Nelson. Meanwhile, the original show was still on Broadway, with more than 1,500 performances in all.         Jean Collins Kerr was born in Scranton, Pa., on July 10, 1922. She attended Marywood Seminary and Marywood College in Scranton and acquired a taste for theater while still a student. She was serving as stage manager of a college production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' when she met Mr. Kerr, then a professor of drama at Catholic University in Washington. Shortly after earning her bachelor's degree at Marywood, she married and received a master's degree from Catholic University in 1945.         Her self-deprecating humor was amply evident in her other published work. She also wrote ''The Snake Has All the Lines'' (1960), ''Penny Candy'' (1970) and ''How I Got to Be Perfect'' (1978), collections of humorous essays.         Her family was a rich source of comic inspiration, a minefield of the unexpected that demanded resilience and a gift for improvisation. In addition to Christopher, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Kerr is survived by her sons Colin of Port Jefferson, N.Y., John of Portland, Me., Gregory of Coopersburg, Pa., and Gilbert of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.; her daughter, Kitty of Arlington, Mass.; her brothers Hugh Collins of Meriden, Conn., and Frank Collins of Ardmore, Pa., and 11 granchildren.         Mr. Kerr, whose long career embraced teaching, playwriting, directing and theater criticism -- first for The New York Herald Tribune and then for The Times -- died in 1996 at 83.         A tall, handsome woman with a ready smile, Mrs. Kerr never took herself too seriously. ''I'm not a natural playwright at all,'' she told an interviewer. ''I write what I know.'' There were those who felt she drew water from the same well too often. Phyllis Theroux, writing about ''How I Got to Be Perfect'' in The New York Times Sunday Book Review, noted that ''beneath her cleverness lies a sizable literary talent'' waiting to be aired.         Mrs. Kerr returned to the theater in 1964 with ''Poor Richard,'' a coolly reviewed romantic comedy.         Nearly 10 years passed before her next appearance on Broadway, with another romantic comedy, ''Finishing Touches'' (1973).         The 1980 comedy ''Lunch Hour'' turned out to be Mrs. Kerr's farewell to the theater. Set in the Hamptons and directed by Mike Nichols, the play starred Sam Waterston and Gilda Radner.         For all her experience and success in the theater, Mrs. Kerr never stopped worrying about how her work would be received.         She regarded opening night as ''a public hanging, and you're the hanged.'' She once said, ''I think if you can write a play or produce a play,'' the first step toward success has been made, if ''people don't want to kill themselves in the lobby.'' Then came the inimitable extra twist of Kerr: ''Now there must be four or five other steps, but that's the first.''       
         Anne Logan Davis Wichern, a lung specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and professor emeritus at New York University who established one of the country's first emphysema clinics, died March 9. She was 78 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The cause was cancer, her family said, and she died at the Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital.         Dr. Davis, as she was known professionally, was a pioneer in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. She founded the emphysema unit at Bellevue in 1956 and remained its director until two years ago, when it was merged into the hospital's chest and asthma units.         She was associated with Bellevue since she started her internship there in 1949. An authority in pulmonary critical care, she formally retired in December as an attending physician at the hospital.         She directed the Bellevue chest clinic from 1987 to 1992, overseeing some 6,000 patient visits every year. Through the 1970's and 1980's, she also was a physician and consultant at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Manhattan.         She started her academic career as an instructor at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1957, rising to assistant professor of medicine in 1968. That year, she accepted an associate professorship with permanent tenure at the New York University School of Medicine, from which she retired in December.         Anne Logan Davis was born in Rahway, N.J., and graduated from Wellesley College in 1945 and received her medical degree at Columbia in 1949. She decided to specialize in chest and pediatric pulmonary medicine while a resident at Bellevue in the 1950's, after recovering from tuberculosis contracted during her internship.         From experience, she found that in a busy municipal hospital the special needs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary illnesses tended to receive short shrift. She was given the opportunity to organize the emphysema clinic to deal comprehensively with the patients' medical, social and economic conditions, and to undertake a systematic study and record of their progress.         Dr. Davis is survived by her husband of 47 years, Dr. Walter Adam Wichern Jr., chairman emeritus of surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center; a son, Walter A. III, and a daughter, A. Logan Wichern, both of Manhattan; and a sister, Carol Goodman of Morristown, N.J.       
         Martha Scott, who created the role of the sweet, ethereal Emily in the original Broadway production of Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town'' and was nominated for an Oscar for repeating it in the film version, died on Wednesday in Los Angeles. She was 88.         Miss Scott's trademark was warm sincerity in an era when glamour-girl artificiality reigned. She appeared in more than 20 movies, at least that many Broadway productions and a variety of television shows. She also produced plays and movies.         She loved to point out that she had played Charlton Heston's mother twice in films, in ''The Ten Commandments'' (1957) and ''Ben-Hur'' (1959) and his wife twice onstage: in ''Design for a Stained Glass Window'' (1950) and ''The Tumbler'' (1960).         But her most sparkling accomplishment was when, as a 23-year-old novice, she was chosen at the last minute for the part of Emily Webb in ''Our Town,'' Wilder's classic about the cycles of birth, love and death in Grovers Corners, a small New England town.         A previous actress had been fired for not capturing the character in the final act, when Emily appears after death.         In an interview with The New York Times in 1969, Miss Scott recalled her brief audition with Jed Harris, the original producer and director of ''Our Town.'' He was desperate because the play was about to open in Princeton, N.J.; she had been recommended for the part by several of his colleagues.         ''He just pushed back my hair, looked at me and said, 'You've got the job,' '' she said. ''Then he said, 'How many years' experience have you had?' I told him five years. He said, 'You're gonna get a chance to prove it.' ''         She did. In his review in The Times in February 1938, Brooks Atkinson praised her interaction with John Craven, who played her husband, saying, ''Some of their scenes are lovely past all enduring.''         She was also praised for her performance as Emily in the film version, but lost the Academy Award to Ginger Rogers, who won for ''Kitty Foyle.''         In 1940, Miss Scott also appeared in ''The Howards of Virginia,'' which many critics consider Cary Grant's worst movie. Her other films included ''In Old Oklahoma'' (1943) with John Wayne and ''The Desperate Hours'' (1955) with Humphrey Bogart.         Martha Ellen Scott was born on Sept. 22, 1914, in Jamesport, Mo. Her father later opened a garage in Gallatin, Mo., and went on to become an engineer for a paint firm in Kansas City. Her parents disapproved of acting, but a sympathetic aunt reportedly lent her $2,500 so she could study acting at the University of Michigan. She repaid the loan.         She then appeared in Shakespearean parts at the 1933-34 Chicago World's Fair. By the winter of 1937-38, she was making the rounds in Manhattan and was asked to audition for the role of Emily.         Miss Scott's long career kept veering back to the stage, which she loved best. In 1991, she played the doomed Rebecca Nurse in ''The Crucible,'' the first production of Tony Randall's National Actors Theater in New York.         Among her many television roles were Sue Ellen Ewing's mother on ''Dallas'' and a mysterious grandmother on ''General Hospital.''         She also produced plays. In 1968, she joined Henry Fonda and Robert Ryan in forming the Plumstead Playhouse, which produced classical revivals with all-star casts in New York. It later became the Plumstead Theater company in Los Angeles.         Her first marriage, to Carlton Alsop, a radio and film producer, ended in divorce in 1946. She later married the composer Mel Powell, who died in 1998.         She is survived by her son, Scott Alsop; her daughters Mary Powell Harpel and Kathleen Powell; and her brother, Charles Scott.         Miss Scott asked to be buried in the cemetery in Jamesport, where she rehearsed Emily's graveyard scene.       
         Elizabeth Fowler, who wrote a harrowing book about being the only woman among 35 passengers on a lifeboat in the Atlantic Ocean for 10 days during World War II, died on May 30 at a convalescent home in West Orange, N.J. She was 95.         On an autumn evening in 1942 she was in her early thirties and had finagled passage on a cargo ship from Africa to escape a troubled marriage and join her young daughter in Connecticut. She was knitting when a German U-boat torpedoed the ship.         Ms. Fowler endured pounding rain, hunger, excruciating thirst, frigid waves and circling sharks as she and her desperate companions bobbed through an intense human drama in a very small space. The episode, as described in news reports, columns and magazine articles, sounds very much like the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 movie ''Lifeboat.'' But there appears to be no direct link. Ms. Fowler's book, ''Standing Room Only'' (Dodd, Mead) was published the same year the movie was released.         Lucy Greenbaum in The New York Times Book Review called Ms. Fowler's account ''a tight, terse tale of war drama where each swell of a wave is matched by the surge of a human emotion.''         The Saturday Review of Literature called the book ''almost unbearable reading at times,'' but said that its directness and vividness made it impossible to put down.         For 35 years, until recently, Ms. Fowler lived in Montclair, N.J., and her saga only gradually became known to friends she met at the local Y.M.C.A. She was a legend there for her daily exercise regimen: swimming 18 laps and doing 36 pull-ups on the diving board well into her 90's. In her 80's, she was still putt-putting around town on a motor scooter.         As Ms. Fowler intermittently spun out the story of her life, friends in the Y's steam room at first thought it implausible.         ''We all thought she was exaggerating,'' Elizabeth Crann she said. ''She was never exaggerating.''         Elizabeth Japp was born in the United States on March 13, 1908, said Ms. Crann, who interviewed her about her life. Miss Japp's father was Sir Henry Japp, a British engineer who built the rail tunnels under the East River. A profile of Sir Henry by The New York Times in 1906 called him ''the wizard.''         In her book, Ms. Fowler, who had both American and British citizenship, said the family moved back to England when she was 12. She attended English schools and then went to study music in Paris, where someone burst into one of her lessons and demanded that the master hear two children. One was the violinist Yehudi Menuhin, who immediately became a pupil.         While in France, Miss Japp became engaged to an English businessman who died in a plane crash when she was 21. She returned to New York.         At some point she met Frank Fowler, a physician who worked on the Gold Coast for the Colonial Medical Service. They left their only daughter, Niccie, in England. After German bombing began, they sent her to live in Connecticut. After strains in her marriage, Ms. Fowler talked her way onto the West Kebar, a ship carrying palm oil from what is now Ghana to New York.         She was the only woman on board, and wrote that the men resented her because they believed she could not pull her weight. German submarines had been attacking many merchant ships, but Ms. Fowler on a pleasant evening was relaxing on deck, knitting. Suddenly, the captain screamed, ''This is it!''         Thirty-five people ended up in a 26-foot lifeboat, a self-contained universe of fear, boredom and oddity. Ms. Fowler wrote of trying to evade a man intent on kissing her, and how she finally managed to urinate in a bucket. Repeatedly and inexplicably, she wrote, she mourned the Burberry coat she had lost.         Mostly she told of her boat mates and their interaction. ''Human decency showed more brightly with some,'' she wrote. ''That was all -- but that was everything too.''         The lifeboat was finally spotted from land, off the coast of Barbados. After they were rescued, she worked as a nanny in Connecticut but was also something of a celebrity. Lord & Taylor displayed her bedraggled dress from the lifeboat in its window, and women's magazines profiled her. The columnist Elsa Maxwell wrote that she ''has had more emotional experiences out of this war than any other human being I know.''         Ms. Fowler, as a result, always thought she was the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's 1944 movie, although her book was a published a month after the release of ''Lifeboat.'' John Steinbeck, who wrote the novella and the screen treatment that became ''Lifeboat,'' does not seem to have mentioned her experience.         But there is no question that her story was in the public eye, and when Ms. Fowler later met the movie's star, Tallulah Bankhead, Miss Bankhead said, ''So I was supposed to be you,'' a comment Ms. Fowler did not take as flattering.         For many years, Ms. Fowler worked as an editor for book and magazine publishers. She is survived by her daughter, Niccie Sesson of England, and a grandson, Ms. Crann said.         She treasured a piece of the lifeboat's sail her companions had given her. ''To a good shipmate,'' it said.       
         Barbara B. Lazarus, an educational anthropologist who studied barriers to women entering science and engineering and created programs to overcome them, died last Tuesday in Pittsburgh. She was 57.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Marvin Sirbu, said.         Dr. Lazarus, who was associate provost for academic affairs at Carnegie Mellon University, was recognized for her creative methods of increasing the number of women in science and engineering at Carnegie Mellon and elsewhere. Her programs became models for other colleges, which often sought her help.         She also helped women's colleges in Asia find ways to help their graduates enter the work force. She combined her professional knowledge of the workplace with her personal experience with cancer -- she was first diagnosed in her early 30's -- to write about the problems cancer survivors face in their careers.         Dr. Lazarus started her work in Providence, R.I., in the early 1970's, developing materials to help telephone counselors advise women who wanted to enter or re-enter the work force. Later, as director of the Center for Women's Careers at Wellesley College, she adopted similar techniques to offer phone counseling to alumni who wanted help with their careers.         She also dreamed up a program now known as ''Explanatoids'' -- signs and videos at playgrounds, amusement parks and other sites to explain the science of everything from roller coasters to the curve balls being thrown at PNC Park, where the Pirates play.         The program will be extended to the Smithsonian Institution's National Air and Space Museum in Washington this fall.         Dr. Lazarus is survived by her husband; two children, Margaret Ann Lazarus Sirbu and Benjamin James Lazarus Sirbu; her parents, David and Betty Lazarus of Urbana, Ill., and Chilmark, Mass.; two brothers, William of Washington and Richard of Cabin John, Md.; and a sister, Mary Ann Lazarus of St. Louis.       
         Josephine Jacobsen, a poet, short-story writer and critic who held the post that later became that of national poet laureate, died on Wednesday in Cockeysville, Md. She was 94 and had lived in Maryland most of her life.         She was consultant in poetry to the Library of Congress from 1971 to 1973; the title was changed to poet laureate consultant in poetry in 1986, the same year Robert Penn Warren was awarded the post. Mrs. Jacobsen's name is on the honor roll of national poets laureate, backdated to 1937, when the consultant's position was created.         Over more than 80 years, her writing braided the physical and spiritual strains of the human experience. Collections of both her poems and prose were published as recently as three years ago.         Mrs. Jacobsen's first poem was printed in a children's magazine when she was 10, but she did not achieve widespread recognition until her 60's and 70's. All the while, her work appeared in nearly every literary or college quarterly that published poetry, as well as in publications like The New Yorker and The New York Times.         She was celebrated for elegant, concise phrasing on a wide range of topics and in varied forms, which she filled with nature and animal imagery. She plumbed questions of identity, interrelatedness and isolation.         In 1993 Mrs. Jacobsen received the Shelley Memorial Award from the Poetry Society of America, and in 1997 its highest award, the Robert Frost Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Poetry. Among other things, the medal honored her legendary generosity in helping younger, struggling poets get their work published, a quality considered rare in her profession.         That aspect of her character came to the fore in 1971, when L. Quincy Mumford, the librarian of Congress, named her consultant in poetry. She was only the fourth woman to receive the honor, and the first in 21 years. Her male predecessors included Robert Frost, Conrad Aiken and, most immediately, William Stafford.         The job had fairly flexible duties, which entailed advising the library on its literary collections, inviting scholars and poets to Washington for readings, and lecturing and reading her own work.         Mrs. Jacobsen, born Josephine Winder Boylan in Cobourg, Ontario, was taken to the United States when she was 3 months old. Privately educated, she graduated from Roland Park Country School in Baltimore in 1926, and in 1932 married Eric Jacobsen.         The couple spent half of each year in New Hampshire, where Mr. Jacobsen, a businessman, liked to garden and play tennis, and Mrs. Jacobsen worked in a little cabin ''down under the trees.''         She gained critical attention with her first publication, ''Let Each Man Remember'' (Kaleidograph, 1940), a collage of 15 love sonnets interspersed with metaphysical love poems. The book, which showed her knack for poetry in a disciplined form, was followed by the intensely personal verses of ''The Human Climate: New Poems'' (Contemporary Poetry, 1953), and ''The Animal Inside'' (Ohio University Press, 1966), which widened her range and touched on subjects of love and death.         Mrs. Jacobsen is survived by a son, Erlend, of Plainfield, Vt.; five grandchildren; and a great-grandson.         She was inducted into the American Academy of Arts and Letters in 1994.         Her books currently in print include ''Distances'' (Press Alley, 1991); ''In the Crevice of Time: New and Collected Poems'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 1995); ''Instant of Knowing: Lectures, Criticism and Occasional Prose,'' Elizabeth Spires, editor (University of Michigan Press, 2000); ''On the Island: New and Selected Stories'' (Ontario Review Press, 1989); and ''What Goes Without Saying: Collected Stories of Josephine Jacobsen'' (Johns Hopkins University Press, 2000).         Correction:  August 2, 2003, Saturday  An obituary of the poet Josephine Jacobsen on July 12 misstated the name of the publisher of her book ''Distances.'' It is Press of Appletree Alley, not Press Alley.       
         Jinx Falkenburg, one of America's highest paid cover-girl models during World War II, and later, with her husband, Tex McCrary, a pioneer talk-show star on both radio and television, died on Wednesday in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 84 and lived in the nearby village of Mill Neck.         She died at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, a Long Island hospital of which she and her husband were among the founders, said her son Kevin McCrary. She and Mr. McCrary had lived apart for many years but remained friends. He died on July 29.         At one point in the 1950's, ''Tex and Jinx,'' as they were known in virtually every American household, had two radio programs, a five-day-a-week television show and a syndicated column in The New York Herald Tribune. They were among the first to refine the format that came to be called the talk show.         In addition to having a successful broadcasting career, Miss Falkenburg was long active in raising money for the Republican Party and helped her husband when he worked to persuade Dwight D. Eisenhower to run for the presidency in 1952.         She was born Eugenia Lincoln Falkenburg on Jan. 21, 1919, in Barcelona, Spain, one of three children of Eugene Falkenburg, an engineer, and Marguerite Crooks Falkenburg, an accomplished amateur tennis player. Mr. Falkenburg had a series of assignments in Spain, where he worked on electrifying railroads. The nickname Jinx was given by her mother. The name stuck.         Soon after Miss Falkenburg was born, the family moved to Chile and then, in her teens, to Los Angeles, where she went to public schools. She left Hollywood High School in 1935 to pursue acting and modeling.         She had already attracted the attention of a talent scout from Warner Brothers who had seen her play tennis. She was signed to a studio contract and, since she was fluent in Spanish, was given Spanish-language movies distributed only in Latin America.         Two years later, she met Paul Hesse, a professional photographer whose work appeared regularly in The American Magazine. He called her ''the most charming, most vital personality I have ever had the pleasure to photograph.'' In August of 1937, her face appeared on the cover, and that quickly led to invitations from more than five dozen other magazines to showcase her hazel eyes and lithe body.         At about this time she was sent to Honolulu to work on a film. In her hotel, she stepped on what she thought was a secure balcony, fell through the floor and landed in the dining room below. In a hospital for her injuries, she was assigned a room near one occupied by Al Jolson, who was convalescing. They were introduced and it led to Jolson's offering her a part as a cowgirl in his musical ''Hold On to Your Hat,'' which opened at the Shubert Theater in New York in 1940.         She met Mr. McCrary, who was then a writer for The Daily Mirror, when he was sent to interview her.         She was regarded as one of the most beautiful women in America. The New York World-Telegram observed that Miss Falkenburg's photogenic face had probably appeared in more different places in this country than that of any other woman around.         In 1941, Liebmann Brewery, the maker of Rheingold beer, decided it might sell a lot more of the brand if each year it bestowed on some attractive young woman the title Miss Rheingold. Miss Falkenburg was the first. It was a plum for any model, since, for starters, it put her name and face in every store in New York that sold beer.         Now she was asked to appear in Hollywood productions made for distribution in the United States. Her acting ability, however, did not attract the attention of the critics, who generally gave her films poor reviews. Among those 1940's movies for Columbia Pictures were ''Sing for Your Supper,'' ''Sweetheart of the Fleet,'' ''Lucky Legs,'' ''Laugh Your Blues Away,'' ''She Has What It Takes,'' ''Two Señoritas From Chicago'' and ''Cover Girl.''         During the war, she spent considerable time entertaining Allied troops, and in 1945 received the Asiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal for her work. When Mr. McCrary returned from the war after service as a photographer and public relations officer for the Army Air Corps, he courted Miss Falkenburg and they were married in June 1945.         In 1946, Miss Falkenburg and Mr. McCrary pooled their considerable powers of persuasion and talked radio station WEAF in New York into giving them their own show. It was broadcast on weekday mornings and quickly became popular with the public and the critics because it tackled issues that were then controversial, including venereal disease, the United Nations and the atom bomb. The program was called ''Hi Jinx,'' and Miss Falkenburg, who had no experience as an interviewer, was coached by Mr. McCrary, who also wrote most of the show himself.         They made their television debut the next year in ''At Home,'' which was broadcast by NBC and showed them interviewing their guests at home. They also had another television program, called ''The Swift Home Service Club,'' in which they offered household hints and conducted chatty interviews.         Meanwhile, a second radio program, ''Meet Tex and Jinx,'' achieved such a following that it became a summer replacement for the popular ''Duffy's Tavern'' in both 1947 and 1948.         Tex and Jinx continued their work in television and also began to write a daily column for The New York Herald Tribune, called ''New York Close-Up.'' That led to yet another television show of the same name, on NBC. Miss Falkenburg's biography, ''Jinx,'' was published in 1951.         By the middle 1950's, Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenburg were conducting their talk show from Peacock Alley in the Waldorf-Astoria.         Miss Falkenburg and Mr. McCrary were friends of John Hay Whitney, who was chairman of the finance committee of the Republican Party. At Mr. Whitney's request, Miss Falkenburg became head of the women's division in 1954.         Miss Falkenburg and Mr. McCrary had two children, John Reagan McCrary 3d of Manhattan and Kevin Jock McCrary of Mill Neck. Both survive them.         After the husband-and-wife talk show eventually ran its course, Mr. McCrary had his own radio shows for a time. He and Miss Falkenburg separated in the 1980's. In later years, she lived quietly on Long Island, serving on the board of the hospital the couple had helped found and working on a planned second autobiography.         Correction:  August 29, 2003, Friday  Because of an editing error, an obituary yesterday about Jinx Falkenburg, a model and early talk-show star, reversed the places of residence of her sons. John Reagan McCrary 3d lives in Mill Neck, N.Y., and Kevin Jock McCrary lives in Manhattan.       
         Dr. Josefina B. Magno, an oncologist who established some of the first hospice programs in the United States and helped bring the hospice concept into the medical mainstream, died on July 27 in Manila. She was 83.         Born in the Philippines, Dr. Magno moved to the Washington area in 1969 to join the staff of the Georgetown University Hospital. Three years later, breast cancer was detected, and she underwent a radical mastectomy and intensive chemotherapy.         The experience made her more aware of the physical and emotional pain suffered by the terminal patients around her. It also made her realize that the medical profession, which focused on curing illness and prolonging life, had relatively little to offer the dying.         After recovering, Dr. Magno went to England, where the world's first research and teaching hospice was established in 1967. She studied the hospice approach there, which combined pain management with psychological and spiritual counseling.         In 1976, she created a pilot hospice program at Georgetown, persuading Blue Cross-Blue Shield to cover expenses for its subscribers by pointing out that fees would be half what hospitals charged. The next year, she established the Hospice of Northern Virginia.         Dr. Magno became the first executive director of the National Hospice Organization in 1980. In three years in office, she persuaded Congress to pass legislation to include hospice care under Medicare.         In 1984, she established the International Hospice Institute to train doctors in the United States and developing countries. Moving to Michigan, she founded the first hospice there and created the hospice service at Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit. In 1998, she returned to the Philippines, where she helped establish programs for the poor.         Josefina Bautista Magno was born on Dec. 28, 1919, in San Fernando, Pampanga, on Luzon. She received a medical degree from the University of Santo Tomas.         She is survived by six children: Jose, Manny and Cesar, of Detroit; Vincent, of Richmond; and Nanette Magno-Velayo and Carlo, of Manila; three sisters; a brother; 15 grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Her husband, Dr. Cesar P. Magno, died in 1955.       
         Althea Gibson emerged in the tennis world of the 1950's as a most unlikely queen of the lawns of Wimbledon and Forest Hills.         In 1950 she became the first black to compete in the United States nationals. She won 56 tournaments, including five Grand Slam singles titles -- the United States nationals and Wimbledon twice, in 1957 and 1958, and the French championship in 1956.         What made that especially remarkable was her background as a rough-hewn product of Harlem, a chronic truant and an eighth-grade dropout.         She had grown up far removed from the two genteel worlds of tennis: the white country club set and the network of black doctors, lawyers and other professionals who pursued tennis on private courts of their own.         Gibson owed much of her success to that very network of black tennis enthusiasts and to a geographic coincidence.         Althea Gibson, born in a sharecropper's shack in Silver, S.C., on Aug. 25, 1927, was brought to New York by her parents when she was a few months old. By chance, the family moved into an apartment on a West 143rd Street block between Lenox and Seventh Avenues that was a designated play street.         When the volunteers from the Police Athletic League closed the block to traffic and set up their recreation equipment, the spot they chose to mark off as a paddle tennis court was right in front of the Gibsons' front stoop.         A natural athlete who excelled in virtually every sport she tried, Gibson took up paddle tennis at 9 and won a citywide championship when she was 12.         In 1941 Buddy Walker, a Harlem bandleader and part-time P.A.L. supervisor, bought her two rackets and introduced her to friends at the Cosmopolitan Tennis Club, a predominantly black club that played on courts on 149th Street just a few blocks away but a world removed from the neighborhood she had known. Gibson was coached there by Fred Johnson, the one-armed club pro, and taken up by the club's members, who taught her some more important lessons.         As she put it in her 1958 autobiography, ''I Always Wanted to Be Somebody,'' the club attracted ''the highest class'' of Harlem residents, people, she noted, who ''had rigid ideas about what was socially acceptable.''         Those ideas were alien to her own experience.         ''I'm ashamed to say,'' she wrote, ''that I was still living pretty wild.''         Gibson would come home late (sometimes the next day) and her father, a garage attendant, would beat her. But Gibson saw her father as merely a stern disciplinarian, not abusive.         Gibson made a lifelong friendship when she approached her idol, the boxing champion Sugar Ray Robinson, in a bowling alley. Sympathetic to her dream of a career in music, he bought her a saxophone.         Finally, to escape her father's wrath, she sought refuge in a Catholic home for girls and eventually received a welfare grant to get her own apartment while she worked at menial jobs.         But it was tennis that gripped her interest. In 1942 she won her first tournament, the New York State girls' championship, sponsored by the American Tennis Association, which had been organized in 1916 by black players as an alternative to the United States Lawn Tennis Association.         In 1946, when she lost in the final of her first A.T.A. women's championship, she caught the eye of two men who changed her life and altered the course of tennis, Hubert A. Eaton of Wilmington, N.C., and R. Walter Johnson of Lynchburg, Va.         These men, both physicians and leaders of a cadre of black enthusiasts determined to crack the racial barriers of mainstream tennis, saw Gibson's potential and became her sponsors.         They arranged for Gibson to live with Eaton and his wife during the school year, practicing on his court and attending high school, and to spend the summer traveling on the A.T.A. circuit with Johnson, who later performed a similar service for Arthur Ashe.         She was 19 when she started at Wilmington Industrial High School, but finished in three years, graduating 10th in her class, and enrolled as a scholarship student at Florida A&M, receiving a degree at 25.         She also flourished on the court, winning the first of her 10 straight A.T.A. national championships in 1947.         In 1949, a year after Dr. Benjamin Weir had become the first black to play in a United States Lawn Tennis Association title event -- the 1948 National Indoor Championships -- Gibson took her first steps beyond the world of the black tennis circuit, making it to the semifinals of the Eastern Indoor Championships and then to the semifinals of the national championships.         The next step proved harder. Even after she had won the 1950 Eastern Indoor Championship and a clamor had begun to let her play in the National Grass Court Championships at Forest Hills, the precursor of the United States Open, the powers of tennis seemed to close ranks to keep her out.         To qualify for an invitation to the 1950 nationals, she was required to first make a name for herself at one of the major preliminary grass-court events. But no invitations were forthcoming.         Alice Marble, a former champion, rallied support for Gibson. ''If tennis is a game for ladies and gentlemen,'' she wrote in a letter to American Lawn Tennis magazine, ''it's time we acted a little more like gentlepeople and less like sanctimonious hypocrites.''         Finally, Gibson received an invitation to the Eastern Grass Court Championships at the Orange Lawn Tennis Club in South Orange, N.J. She made it only as far as the second round, but that was enough to win a bid to Forest Hills.         On Aug. 28, 1950, three years after Jackie Robinson had broken the color barrier in major league baseball, Gibson became the first black player to compete in the national tennis championship. Taking her place on a remote court at the West Side Tennis Club in Forest Hills, Queens, she dispatched Barbara Knapp of England, 6-2, 6-2.         The next day, she faced the Wimbledon champion, Louise Brough. After losing the first set, 6-1, Gibson took the second, 6-3, then fell behind by 3-0 in the third before beginning a surge that brought repeated roars from 2,000 hardy spectators who ignored the first peals of thunder and flashes of lightning of a gathering storm.         Gibson took a lead of 7-6 and was on the verge of victory over her visibly spent opponent. But the rains came, the match was suspended, and when it resumed the next day, Brough won three straight games to win the match.         The 5-foot-10 1/2 Gibson gained the attention of the tennis public. A powerful if inconsistent player, the lean and muscular young woman had a dominating serve, and her long, graceful reach often stunned opponents.         Over the next half-dozen years, Gibson became a fixture on the tennis circuit, playing Wimbledon for the first time in 1951 and earning a ranking as high as No. 7 in the United States.         But Gibson became so disenchanted with her failure to break through to the top that she considered abandoning tennis and entering the Army.         In the fall of 1955, the State Department selected her for a goodwill tennis tour of Asia and the Far East, and the experience inspired her game. In 1956 she won 16 of her first 18 tournaments, including the French championship at Roland Garros, her first title at a Grand Slam event.         But once again victory in the singles championships eluded her at Wimbledon and Forest Hills, although she had been favored to win both. Gibson did team with Angela Buxton to win the Wimbledon doubles in 1956. She won in doubles again in 1957, with Darlene Hard, and in 1958, with Maria Bueno.         After losing to Shirley Fry of the United States in the singles final of the Australian Open in 1957, she did not lose another match all year. Passing up the clay court distraction of the French championship to concentrate on tuning up on grass courts in England, she again entered Wimbledon as the favorite and defeated Hard in the final.         ''At last,'' she said, ''at last,'' as she accepted the trophy from Queen Elizabeth II.         She later wrote in her autobiography: ''Shaking hands with the Queen of England was a long way from being forced to sit in the colored section of the bus going into downtown Wilmington, N.C.''         Upon returning home, Gibson was given a ticker-tape parade up Broadway, a banquet at the Waldorf-Astoria and a celebration on West 143rd Street.         She told friends and supporters, ''This victory belongs to you,'' but she chaffed at efforts to make her a symbol of black achievement.         When a reporter asked if she was proud to be compared to Jackie Robinson as an outstanding representative of her race, Gibson replied: ''No. I don't consider myself to be a representative of my people. I am thinking of me and nobody else.''         Having won Wimbledon, Gibson rolled through the national championship at Forest Hills. In the final, she defeated Brough, who had eliminated her in her first national seven years before.         After being named the outstanding female athlete of the year in a poll of Associated Press sports editors, Gibson repeated her Wimbledon and Forest Hills singles victories in 1958, and was named the outstanding female athlete again. Then, under pressure from her family to make some money from her talent, she announced her retirement from amateur tennis.         At a time when the professional game was little more than a sideshow, she had little trouble winning the pro title and went on an exhibition tour with the Harlem Globetrotters, playing tennis at halftime.         In the early 1960's she became the first black player to compete on the women's golf tour, but she never won a tournament. Gibson, who was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame at Newport, R.I., later held various athletic posts in New Jersey state government. A resident of East Orange, she had served as its recreation director.         Gibson was married twice, to William Darben and Sidney Llewellyn. She had no children.         When another black woman, Zina Garrison, made it to the Wimbledon final in 1990 before losing to Martina Navratilova, Gibson was there to cheer her on, but she soon receded from the limelight once again with health and financial problems.         ''It was truly an inspiration for me to watch her overcome adversity,'' Billie Jean King, who was 13 when she first say Gibson play, told The Associated Press yesterday. ''Her road to success was a challenging one, but I never saw her back down.''         Robert McG. Thomas Jr., a reporter for The New York Times, died in 2000.         Correction:  October 2, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Monday about Althea Gibson, the first black competitor in the United State tennis nationals and the winner of five Grand Slam titles, gave an incorrect surname for the first black player in a United States Lawn Tennis Association title event. He was Dr. Reginald Weir, not Benjamin.       
         Marie Foster, a dental technician whose quiet but effective efforts to win voting rights for blacks made her a national symbol when she was beaten by the police in the Selma, Ala., voting rights march in 1965, died on Saturday in Selma. She was 85.         She was one of the original eight members of the Dallas County Voters League, a group that came to be called the Courageous Eight and worked with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and other civil rights leaders to make Selma the center of a national crusade. She was later called ''the mother of the voting rights movement'' by its local organizers.         She tried eight times to register to vote before succeeding; she had already started coaching blacks on how to pass the deliberately bewildering voter registration tests.         She was clubbed at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge when state troopers stopped the first march from Selma to Montgomery on March 7. Two days later, she tried to hobble forward in another march, one that was stopped peacefully.         On March 11, when President Lyndon B. Johnson went on national television to announce that he would send Congress a strong voting rights bill, it was in Mrs. Foster's living room that Dr. King watched and wept at the news.         When the march was finally permitted to begin on March 21, two weeks later, Mrs. Foster walked 50 miles in five days with injured knees.         In his book on the civil rights movement, ''The Children'' (Random House, 1998), David Halberstam called Mrs. Foster ''one of the heroes of the Selma group.''         Marie Priscilla Martin was born on Oct. 24, 1917, in rural Wilcox County, near Alberta, Ala. Her mother wanted her children to be educated, but her father resisted moving to town, Mrs. Foster said in a statement prepared for the Web site of the National Voting Rights Museum and Institute in Selma, which she helped found. Her mother then sneaked away and took her children to Selma.         Mrs. Foster dropped out of high school to marry and had three young children when her husband died. After working for years, she returned to high school and graduated after her daughter, Rose. She then went to junior college, became a dental hygienist and went to work for her brother, Dr. Sullivan Jackson.         She became involved in the growing voting rights movement because of anger over racial discrimination. Mr. Halberstam suggested that being employed by her brother protected her from economic pressure from the white establishment.         Working with the Dallas County Voters League, she went door to door with leaflets and asked all ministers in town to announce the registration effort from their pulpits.         Things at first went slowly. Taylor Branch, in his book ''Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years 1963-65'' (Simon & Schuster, 1998), said her first nighttime class to teach literacy for the voting test drew one student, a man in his 70's.         In 1964, she was named in an injunction against voter registration leaders along with John Lewis, the civil rights leader who is now a Georgia congressman, Mr. Branch wrote. The Ku Klux Klan threatened her life several times.         In 1985, Mrs. Foster told about her experience at the bridge in an interview with United Press International.         ''It was a trooper who hit me,'' she said, adding that it happened just as she crossed the bridge near the head of the column of about 525 demonstrators. ''I lay on the pavement with my eyes closed. I didn't move. I stood my ground.''         Mrs. Foster is survived by her son, James Foster of Indianapolis; her daughter, Rose Davis of Salt Lake City; her brothers, Dr. Sullivan Jackson and Thomas Martin, both of Selma; and three grandchildren.         Her activism never stopped, said Rose Sanders, a friend and civil rights lawyer. Among more recent battles, Mrs. Foster was a leader in successful fights for public housing for poor people in Selma and the removal of a statue of the founder of the Klan from a public park.         She conducted reading classes for underprivileged children in a small classroom next to her home, and made it a point to take poor children to Sunday school.         ''She never quit,'' Ms. Sanders said.       
         Margaret E. Murie, a conservationist and an author who helped preserve millions of acres of unspoiled land in Alaska and across the United States by encouraging the creation of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the passage of the Wilderness Act, died on Sunday at her ranch in Moose, Wyo. She was 101.         A longtime official of the Wilderness Society, she was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, by President Bill Clinton in 1998.         Ms. Murie, who was known as Mardy, grew up in a log cabin in Alaska, an experience that she wrote about in her autobiography, ''Two in the Far North.''         Published in 1962 and still in print, the book describes the winter night when she was 14 and Fairbanks caught fire, prompting her father and other men to burn the town's bacon supply as fuel to keep the steam-powered water pump running; her late-winter dogsled trips over thawing rivers; how in 1924 she became the first woman to graduate from the University of Alaska; and her marriage later that year, in a 3 a.m. sunrise ceremony, to Olaus Murie, a biologist for the Biological Survey, the forerunner of the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.         ''Two in the Far North'' also recounts the couple's honeymoon, a 500-mile caribou research expedition by dogsled, as well as a later river journey taken with their infant son, Martin, strapped to their canoe.         Although Ms. Murie (pronounced MYUR-ee) and her husband moved to Wyoming in the 1930's to study elk migrations, they never lost their focus on Alaska and returned there often.         After traveling in the Brooks Range above the Arctic Circle in the summer of 1956, they began a campaign to set aside parts of the area as a wildlife refuge.         Four years later, President Dwight D. Eisenhower designated eight million acres as the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge; President Jimmy Carter more than doubled the protected area in 1980.         The Muries extended their preservation campaign in the early 1960's by lobbying Congress in behalf of the Wilderness Act, legislation intended to prevent development on designated lands nationwide. Ms. Murie continued her support after her husband's death in 1963. She was invited to the White House by President Lyndon B. Johnson to attend the signing of the act.         Ms. Murie received numerous other honors for her support of conservation and the protection of the environment, including the 1980 Audubon Medal and the 1983 John Muir Award from the Sierra Club.         Born Margaret Elizabeth Thomas on Aug. 18, 1902, in Seattle, she moved to Alaska with her family when she was 9.         In addition to her autobiography, she wrote two other books, ''Island Between,'' published in 1977, and ''Wapiti Wilderness,'' published in 1966 with her husband as co-author.         Their Wyoming home, the Murie Ranch, was declared a National Historic District in 1997 and today is the headquarters of the Murie Center, an educational center dedicated to conservation.         Ms. Murie is survived by her sister Louise Murie-MacLeod of Jackson, Wyo., who was the wife of Olaus's brother Adolph, who was a National Park Service biologist and an author; two sons, Martin, of North Bangor, N.Y., and Donald, of Palm Springs, Calif.; a daughter, Joanne Miller of Brookline, Mass.; 9 grandchildren; and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Marie Marcus, a jazz pianist who was a protégée of Fats Waller and appeared on Manhattan's 52nd Street, the prewar epicenter of jazz, before becoming a summer fixture in nightclubs on Cape Cod, died on Oct. 10 in Hyannis, Mass. She was 89.         In a book about jazz personalities, ''Barney, Bradley, and Max'' (Oxford, 1989), the jazz critic Whitney Balliett suggested that Mrs. Marcus's talent and experience elevated her into a higher league than the normal run of resort acts. ''At first, her style seems a simple mélange of chunky chords and brief connective runs, but on closer examination it is a repository of the jazz piano playing of the thirties and forties,'' he wrote.         Marie Eleanor Doherty, an only child, was born in Roxbury, Mass., on May 25, 1914. Her father, a plumber, and her mother were elegant ballroom dancers and had a player piano in the house with rolls by the likes of Waller.         She started playing the piano at 4 and studied at the New England Conservatory of Music while attending Roxbury Memorial High. She started in children's radio shows and ended up in Manhattan playing the piano on a national radio show for NBC as well as in clubs, under the name Marie Doherty.         When Waller persuaded her to play in an after-hours club in Harlem, he pointed to his heart and said, ''For a white girl, you sure got it there.''         She asked him whether he knew a good piano teacher. He answered, ''How about me?'' and gave her lessons when he was in town.         With the licks she absorbed from him, she made it to 52nd Street, the epicenter of jazz, where she played at the Swing Club.         At the end of her New York years, she led a 12-piece band and, after several musicians were drafted, a six-piece one. Her agent sent her to the Coonamessett Club in Falmouth on Cape Cod, in part to help her relax from the exhausting work. The respite became a happy 40-year residency, and she became popular with both locals and tourists.         President Kennedy came to hear her and Alma Gates White play as the ''piano mamas'' at the Panama Club in Hyannis.         For many years, she also spent winters performing in Miami Beach. In the 1950's, she appeared on television shows like Steve Allen's ''Tonight'' show and the ''Dave Garroway Show.''         In 1937, she married Jack Brown, a singer. They later separated, and he died. She later married Bill Marcus, a trumpet player and later a lawyer. He died in 1965.         She is survived by her sons, Jack Brown, of Quincy, Mass., and William Marcus, of Fort Lauderdale; her daughters, Mary Liles and Barbara Marcus, both of St. Petersburg, Fla.; eight grandchildren; and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Evan Ruderman, whose theatrical monologue about her own experience with AIDS was a major part of a documentary shown on public television in 1996, died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. She was 44.         The cause was complications of AIDS, her mother, Dr. Cydelle Berlin, said.         Ms. Ruderman was active in feminist and political causes. She dropped out of high school to become an apprentice electrician, and became a leader of organizations promoting jobs for women in blue-collar trades, including Women in the Trades and NEW, whose name is an acronym for nontraditional employment for women.         She later worked toward her high school diploma and received two years of college-level training to become a full member of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 3. She was the fifth woman in the group, her mother said.         Ms. Ruderman, who was born in Brooklyn on March 28, 1959, learned she was H.I.V. positive in 1988 and developed full-blown AIDS in 1990.         Her mother, Dr. Berlin, was involved in AIDS education, but Ms. Ruderman did not tell her that she was H.I.V. positive until 1989. The year before, Dr. Berlin had started a group to visit schools and other places to explain AIDS. Dr. Berlin was considering theatrical use of an anonymous monologue by someone suffering from AIDS when her daughter told her she had written it. Ms. Ruderman and her monologue then became part of the production.         In 1996, PBS showed a documentary by the producer Roger Weisberg about her mother's group, called the Star Theater. The group was first affiliated with Mount Sinai Medical Center and is now sponsored by St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. Ms. Ruderman played a featured role in the production, titled ''Sex and Other Matters of Life and Death.''         Ms. Ruderman retired as an electrician 11 years ago with a full pension from her union, her mother said. She remained active in AIDS causes. In 2002 at the Worlds AIDS Conference in Barcelona, Spain, she represented New York area women who were unable to attend the larger gathering.         Ms. Ruderman is survived by her mother, who lives in Manhattan; her father, Robert, of Manhattan; her stepmother, Vicki Fian of Manhattan; her sister, Leigh Roumila of Ridgewood, N.J.; and her brothers, Jamie, of Maplewood, N.J., and Adam, of Manhattan.         Correction:  November 27, 2003, Thursday  An obituary of the AIDS activist and educator Evan Ruderman on Friday gave an incorrect surname for her surviving stepmother. She is Vicki Sufian, not Fian.       
         C. Z. Guest, one of the monarchs of New York society who was a perennial selection on the best-dressed list, a noted horsewoman and an authority on gardening, died yesterday at home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 83.         Mrs. Guest's interest in horticulture began when she was a child following the family gardener around her parents' estate on the North Shore of Boston. Her name then was Lucy Douglas Cochrane, but she soon became C. Z. when her brother, Alexander, could not pronounce ''sister.'' Embarking on a writing career relatively late in life, she was the author of books on gardening and a children's book, ''Tiny Green Thumbs.'' She also wrote a syndicated weekly column that appeared in 350 newspapers across the nation.         Mrs. Guest began her writing career while recovering from a horseback riding accident in 1976. While she was convalescing, frequent telephone calls from friends about their gardening problems prompted her first book, ''First Garden,'' which was illustrated by her ''very dear friend'' Cecil Beaton and which had an introduction by another ''dear, dear friend,'' Truman Capote.         In his introduction, Capote described Mrs. Guest working in her garden: ''There, with her baskets and spades and clippers, and wearing her funny boyish shoes, and with her sunborne sweat soaking her eyes, she is a part of the sky and the earth, possibly a not too significant part, but a part.''         Beaton and Capote were only two in a legion of celebrities and jet-setters who surrounded Mrs. Guest throughout her vivid life. When she was married in 1947 to Winston Frederick Churchill Guest, an international polo star, heir to the Phipps steel fortune and a second cousin of Winston Churchill, the ceremony was held at the home of Ernest Hemingway in Cuba, with Hemingway serving as best man.         Until Mr. Guest's death in 1982, the couple was prominent in international social circles, hunting in India with the Maharaja of Jaipur and frequently entertaining the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who subsequently became godparents of their children, Cornelia and Alexander.         C. Z. Guest was considered one of America's classic beauties. The writer Jill Gerston once described her this way: ''With her pale skin, blue eyes, ash-blond hair and trim figure, she is cut from the same cool, silky cloth as Grace Kelly. It is a patrician beauty that is indigenous to socially registered enclaves like Palm Beach and Southampton, a sporty, outdoorsy look that eschews makeup, hairspray and anything trendy. She has an outspoken, coolly self-assured manner and a throaty, well-modulated voice with a trace of a British accent.''         In 1962, Time magazine did a lengthy article on American society and apotheosized Mrs. Guest on its cover as the model of horsy high society. She posed in front of her Long Island estate wearing a button-down shirt and tie and jodhpurs, a sleek hound at her side, the personification of old-guard chic. Truman Capote once described Mrs. Guest as the incarnation of understated elegance and said she was ''a cool vanilla lady.'' John Fairchild, then publisher of Women's Wear Daily, described her as ''Southampton, Long Island American, Ivy League blond.'' British Vogue said she had ''the face of a flower.''         Often adorned by Mainbocher, Givenchy and Adolfo, she was chosen by the New York Dress Institute as one of the best-dressed women in the world early in the 1950's and remained on the list for years until her elevation to the Fashion Hall of Fame.         Mrs. Guest was also the designer of a small fashion collection introduced in 1985 and at the time made up principally of cashmere sweaters. ''I will only sell what I like to wear,'' she said after her sweaters had been displayed flung casually around the shoulders of models at the semiannual show of the designer Adolfo. A limited sportswear line was licensed in 1986 and in 1990 she came out with a fragrant insect repellent spray and other garden products.         Lucy Douglas Cochrane was born in Boston on Feb. 19, 1920, the second of five children of Alexander Lynde Cochrane, an investment banker, and Vivian Cochrane, the former Vivian Wessell. Her father died when she was 6. She was educated by tutors and later graduated from the Fermata School in Aiken, S.C. She made her debut in 1937, and was voted the glamour girl of the Massachusetts North Shore in a contest held in 1939, which prompted a brief fling as a showgirl. She appeared in a 1943 revue on the roof of the Ritz-Carlton in Boston and in a revival of the Ziegfeld Follies on Broadway in 1944. She spent six months in Hollywood attending 20th Century Fox's studio school but never appeared in a film.         ''My ambition was to be a successful enough actress to get myself thrown out of the Social Register,'' she once said. ''I had no talent at all but I enjoyed every minute of my experience.'' It was also during this period that she took off for Mexico, where Diego Rivera painted her as a nude odalisque. When she became engaged to Mr. Guest, her portrait, which had reportedly been displayed in a Mexico City bar, was bought by her fiancé's family.         Mrs. Guest became interested in volunteer work as a debutante in Boston and was active in numerous charitable organizations over the years, including the Children's Research and Asthma Institute, the Police Athletic League and the March of Dimes.         For years she was chairwoman of the April in Paris Ball and was a favorite of society columnists, who often mentioned her lunching with such friends as Elsa Maxwell, Mrs. William Paley, Mrs. Earl Smith, Doris Duke and Estée Lauder. They also mentioned her riding in the hunt country of Virginia, taking in the polo matches at the Piping Rock Club on Long Island, working hard on her orchids in her greenhouses or walking the grounds of Templeton, her estate on Long Island, trailed by a string of hunting dogs.         During the 1930's and 40's she was one of society's leading hostesses. ''She was very comfortable with all kinds of people, which is not common for a woman who's born to the purple, so to speak,'' her friend Eppie Lederer (the advice columnist Ann Landers) once observed.         The Guests jointly owned racing stables, with Mr. Guest supervising those in Chantilly, France, and Mrs. Guest supervising others in Middleburg, Va.. She loved exercising her horses and did so most mornings. For years she competed in the leading horse shows.         In 1984, Mrs. Guest was named commissioner general of the American garden exhibit of the International Garden Festival in Liverpool, England. The project, jointly sponsored by the United States Information Agency and the United States Forest Service, was a memorial to members of the Army Air Force who were killed in World War II.         Mrs. Guest was amused when her daughter, Cornelia was hailed by Life magazine as ''the debutante of the year'' in 1982 and herself became the darling of columnists and photographers.         In addition to her son Alexander, of Hunterdon County, N.J., and her daughter, Cornelia, of Old Westbury, she is survived by two stepsons, Winston Guest of Palm Beach, and Frederick, of New York, and three grandchildren.         ''I've always felt that having a garden is like having a good and loyal friend,'' C.Z. Guest once said.

         Jenifer Estess, a theatrical producer who set up a foundation for research into Lou Gehrig's disease after she learned she had it, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 40.         The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or A.L.S., as Lou Gehrig's disease is formally known, her sister Valerie Estess said.         Ms. Estess was told in 1997 that she had the condition, a degenerative disease of the nerve cells that control muscular movement. It affects 30,000 Americans and is usually fatal within two to five years.         With friends and family members, Ms. Estess set up Project A.L.S., and, calling on her experience as a producer, she raised more than $17 million and brought together scientists from different laboratories to cooperate in the search for a cure.         The foundation paid for investigations into genetics, stem cells, gene therapy, accelerated drug testing and disease pathways. Some new approaches may help those with related conditions, like Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, as well as brain and spinal cord injury, her sister said.         Jenifer Greer Estess was born on Feb. 17, 1963, in Moline, Ill., and grew up in Harrison, N.Y. After graduating from New York University with a major in drama, she worked as an actor. She helped found and was producing director of Naked Angels, a Manhattan theater company.         She then worked in public relations and helped found the Nantucket Film Festival and the New York Women's Film Festival.         Project A.L.S. has staged benefits involving show business celebrities in New York and Los Angeles, and in 2002 it arranged for Project A.L.S. Day at 14 major-league baseball stadiums. At each event, a celebrity read Gehrig's famous farewell speech, in which he declared to Yankee fans that he considered himself ''the luckiest man on the face of the earth.''         In 2001, Ms. Estess produced a movie for CBS television called ''Jenifer'' that told her own story. That year, she was named Glamour magazine's Woman of the Year.         Next May, HBO is planning to show a documentary about her.         The publication of her memoir, ''Tales From the Bed: On Living, Dying and Having It All,'' is scheduled for May.         Project A.L.S. will continue, Valerie Estess said.         In addition to her sister Valerie, who lives in Manhattan, Ms. Estess is survived by her mother, Marilyn R. Estess, of Rye, N.Y.; her other sisters, Alison Estess of Manhattan and Meredith Hulbert of Harrison; and her brother, Noah, of San Diego.
