         Mary Ingraham Bunting-Smith, the Radcliffe president who sought ways to help educated women carve out careers in a society not yet transformed by the feminist movement and became a mentor to several female writers, performers and scholars, died on Wednesday at Kendal at Hanover, a continuing care community in New Hampshire. She was 87.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith, a microbiologist who was Radcliffe president from 1959 to 1972, was called Polly from childhood and added Smith to her name after her second marriage,  in 1979.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith, who was also known for overseeing the fuller integration of Radcliffe College into Harvard, founded the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study -- now the Bunting Institute -- to help women who were scholars, writers, artists and scientists return to careers interrupted by family obligations.         ''Polly Bunting was always ahead of her time in anticipating the needs of women and of Radcliffe College,'' said Derek Bok, president emeritus of Harvard and a professor there. ''The idea of the Radcliffe Institute seems so obvious now. But the idea that there would be women who wanted to come back was a new idea then, and she saw that and created an institution that made it possible.''         Mrs. Bunting-Smith was also the first female member of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, a member of the President's Committee on the Status of Women and a vice president of the Peace Corps.         Underused women and interrupted careers were a theme for Mrs. Bunting-Smith. She chided society for its ''waste of highly talented, educated womenpower,'' as she put it in a 1961 article she wrote for The New York Times Magazine, calling it a ''prodigious national extravagance.''         A soft-spoken woman who herself had worked part time while her children were young, she devoted her life to fighting that waste, to raising expectations among and about women and to creating opportunities for them.         As she saw it, two ''hidden dissuaders'' lowered the professional expectations of women: a system of higher education that, first, ignored real differences between male and female patterns of life and, second, did not provide for women who wanted to keep working part time in their fields while raising families. She established the Radcliffe Institute specifically to give scholarships to women cut off from careers by marriage.         To see a model of an active, engaged woman, Mrs. Bunting-Smith had only to look within her own family. Born in Brooklyn in 1910, she was one of four children of Mary Shotwell Ingraham, who was president of both the Brooklyn Young Women's Christian Association and the Y.W.C.A.'s national board. Her mother was also  a member of the New York City Board of Higher Education who helped plan the creation of the City University. Her father was Henry A. Ingraham, a lawyer and one of the founders of Long Island College of Medicine.         In her early years, Polly Bunting loved being outside. Although an avid reader, she did not go to school regularly until high school, because of her uncertain health. And she did not enjoy school. ''I was glad to get rid of it in the afternoon and get back to something interesting,'' she once said.         A growing interest in the sciences drew her into academia. She majored in physics at Vassar College, her mother's alma mater. At the University of Wisconsin, she studied agricultural bacteriology, earning a master's degree and a doctorate and meeting her husband, Henry Bunting, a medical student who shared her interest in hiking and bird watching. During his medical residency, she taught at Bennington College in Vermont. They married in 1937 and moved to Connecticut, where he was on the faculty of Yale University and she conducted research, working on the effects of radiation on bacteria.         While her four children were young, she spent more time at home, in Bethany, Conn. But even with young children, Mrs. Bunting-Smith was a 4-H leader, served on the library and school boards and was one of the organizers and directors of the Public Health Nursing Association.         When her husband died of a brain tumor in 1954, however, Mrs. Bunting-Smith was forced to look for a full-time job. Because she was a woman, there were no faculty openings at Yale, her son Charles recalled yesterday, and she jumped at the offer to become dean of Douglass College, the women's college of Rutgers University. She was a professor in the department of bacteriology there and an honorary professor at the Rutgers Institute of Microbiology.         At Douglass, she introduced a multilingual course in world poetry run by the students, as well as a program of part-time study for married women.         Five years later, at age 48, she was offered a job as the fifth president of Radcliffe College, the undergraduate college for women at Harvard University, with about 1,775 women.         She liked talking to students and kept an open door. She taught a freshman seminar. In meetings with students, she would sometimes kick off her shoes and invite her guests to do the same, and to join her on the floor. She also liked to chat with students who dropped by her Brattle Street house, and she would turn on her porch light on to signal that she was in.         Such access did not protect her from student protest. In the late 1960's, 20 black students sat in the Radcliffe administration offices seeking increased minority enrollment. Mrs. Bunting-Smith, who was at a conference in North Carolina, flew back to meet with the protesters and promised to act on their complaints. She faced other protests during the Vietnam War.         Another source of dissension was her work to merge Radcliffe more completely into Harvard. Radcliffe students already took classes with Harvard students, but they were admitted to college separately and had their own living quarters, administration and trustees. Mrs. Bunting-Smith thought the system inequitable and worked to integrate the campuses more fully, even though it ultimately reduced the role of the Radcliffe president.         But she may be best remembered for the establishment of the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, which opened in 1961 with the help of $150,000 from the Carnegie Foundation and other grants. Its purpose was to pursue research into the psychological and cultural factors that affected women's status in society, and also to support female artists, scientists and scholars, particularly those who had suspended their careers because of family responsibilities.         In its first year the institute gave 20 women scholarships of up to $3,000 each, space to do their work and access to Radcliffe and Harvard services.         The poet Maxine Kumin, a member of that first group of scholars, remembers her two years at the institute as an ''amazing'' experience, with a diverse group of artists, scientists, social scientists and poets, ''with Polly Bunting as our ringmaster.''         Ms. Kumin said that at a time when she was teaching English composition to physical education majors at Tufts University because only men were allowed to teach liberal arts majors, ''being chosen as a Radcliffe scholar put an imprimatur on what you were doing and gave it legitimacy.''         Since that first class of scholars, more than 1,200 women have been given fellowships at the institute, including the author Alice Walker, the psychologist Carol Gilligan; former Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont; the poets Anne Sexton and Sophie Cabot Black; the performance artist Anna Deavere Smith; the anthropologist Mary Catherine Bateson, and the geophysicist and astronaut Marcia McNutt.         After Mrs. Bunting-Smith stepped down as president of Radcliffe in 1972, she spent three years as special assistant to the president of Princeton University, William Bowen, working on coeducation there.         In 1979, she married Dr. Clement A. Smith, a pediatrician and faculty member at Harvard. He died in 1988.         Mrs. Bunting-Smith is survived by three sons, Charles I. Bunting of Shelbourne, Vt., William H. Bunting of North Whitefield, Me., and John E. Bunting of New Boston, N.H.; a daughter, Mary B. Decher of Bellevue, Wash; three stepdaughters,  Pamela Smith of Harvard, Me., Gail Smith Biggar of Concord, Mass., and Hilary Smith of Peacham, Vt.; a stepson, Reynolds Smith of Harvard, Me.; a sister, Winifred I. Warner of Laurel Hollow, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Alma Hawkins, a pioneering modern-dance educator who founded the dance department at the University of California at Los Angeles, died on Jan. 8 at her home in Santa Monica. She was 94.         Born in Rolla, Mo., Dr. Hawkins graduated from the University of Missouri and went on to study at Teachers College, Columbia University, where she became interested in modern dance. She trained in dance at Bennington College and in Colorado before earning master's and doctor's degrees at Columbia.         She taught at Emporia State University in Kansas and George Williams College in Chicago before joining the dance program at U.C.L.A.; she was its chairwoman from 1953 to her retirement in 1977.         In 1962, Dr. Hawkins established an autonomous dance department, equal in status to the departments of art, music and theater arts, at the College of Fine Arts at the university.         According to the University of California at Los Angeles, it was the nation's first university dance department, eventually offering degrees in dance therapy, dance history, esthetics and education as well as choreography and performance.         Dr. Hawkins encouraged the establishment of an interdepartmental program in ethnic arts that later became the world arts and cultures program. She worked closely with dance presenters to bring leading American and foreign troupes to perform at Royce Hall at the university.         In 1967, she formed the Council of Dance Administrators, a product of a national conference on dance sponsored by the arts and humanities division of the United States Office of Education.         The council published ''Standards for Dance Major Programs'' of colleges in 1979, leading to a national dance certification program. Also in 1967, Dr. Hawkins founded the West Coast Dance Film Archives. She later founded the national Council of Graduate Dance/Movement Therapy Educators.         Dr. Hawkins was a dance therapist and researcher at the university's Neuropsychiatric Institute from 1960 to 1977, training dance therapists and creating a series of educational research films about the field. On her retirement from U.C.L.A., Dr. Hawkins taught for more than 10 years in the dance department at Santa Monica College.         She is survived by her sister, Alice Hawkins of Santa Monica, Calif.       
         Sister Bernadette Szymczak, who fought hunger and despair with such loving zeal that she turned a tiny Brooklyn food program into a mighty engine of sustenance and hope, died Monday at Long Island College Hospital. She was 76 and, until six months ago, had been getting up at 5 A.M. to stir the soup and poor people's spirits as the hands-on founding director of St. John's Bread and Life Soup Kitchen.         Friends said the cause was stomach cancer.         On paper, the soup kitchen Sister Bernadette founded in 1982 at the old red-brick campus of St. John's University on Lewis Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant would seem impressive enough. The 1,000 or so hot meals it serves each weekday in the old priests' dining hall make it the largest of the 1,000 emergency food kitchens and pantries that distribute about 60 million meals a year to New York City's poor.         And its array of medical, job placement, adult education and other satellite programs have won it a reputation as a model of its kind.         But to those who knew Sister Bernadette and fell under her spell, the numbers hardly measure her impact on the lives of those most food agencies regard as clients and Sister Bernadette knew only as guests.         ''She turned my life around,'' said Bill Baker, a one-time drug addict and petty criminal, recalling yesterday that his road to personal salvation began one freezing January day a few years ago when he stopped by St. John's for a warming cup of coffee and was approached by Sister Bernadette.         Speaking with a distinct Boston accent, she posed the question that would change his life: ''Would you mind helping with the trays?''         Like countless other street toughs before and after him, Mr. Baker, who had just got out of jail, found himself on his feet taking the first steps with a load of trays that would lead him  into Sister Bernadette's world of service before self.         ''The next day I came in a little earlier,'' he said, recalling the beginning of a slow, often-painful process that would, under Sister Bernadette's gentle goading, lead him to become a full-time volunteer, to abandon drugs and, finally, to join the kitchen's small staff.         ''She never gave up on me,'' he said.         A loving tenacity seemed to be the hallmark of a woman whose guests, not always the most stable of sorts, would sometimes become so disruptive she would throw them out, then welcome them back the next day.         To most of the guests, however, she was a warm and cordial woman who knew the regulars by name, inquired after their children and set such an inspiring standard of scurrying service that it is hardly surprising that the kitchen's two-dozen scurrying volunteers are all former guests.         To the volunteers she was also cordial, unless they became too boisterous, in which case they would see the stern side of a woman who brooked no nonsense when it came to helping those in need.         A native of Boston who was orphaned as a child, Bernadette Szymczak (pronounced SIM-zak) lived for a while in a home operated by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent DePaul, the order she later joined. By the time she got to Brooklyn in 1971, she had spent 25 years working with children in homes in Boston, Buffalo and Philadelphia.         For a few years after she and other members of the order established themselves in Brooklyn, at the request of the Vincentian priests who run St. John's parish, there seemed little need for a soup kitchen.         The once prosperous neighborhood had descended into poverty, but Food Stamps and other Great Society programs had all but eliminated hunger in Bedford-Stuyvesant and elsewhere, so much so that by 1980 only about 50 small soup kitchens were being operated in New York City.         Then came the Reagan Administration cutbacks of 1981, and as the need for food began to soar, Sister Bernadette, who had already established a thrift shop and an adult education program, started the soup kitchen, initially serving 15 or so meals a day.         Over the next decade and a half, as the slender woman in the plain blue habit grew frail in her work, she became a neighborhood heroine. As she walked along some of the city's meanest streets, layabouts would rise from their stoops, the faces of hardened young criminals would soften and she would be besieged with offers of assistance.         For all her charity, Sister Bernadette, whose idea of a hobby was to do a bit of sewing, then give her handiwork away, was not completely above a taste for luxury.         Friends who knew her weakness would take her out for a breakfast of pancakes or bring her a treat from McDonald's.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Rell Sunn, the Hawaiian surfer who skimmed across the waves with such sure and natural grace that she sometimes seemed at one with the sea, died on Jan. 2 at her home in Makaha on the island of Oahu. She was 47.         Ms. Sunn won international fame as a surfing champion and captured the heart of Hawaii during a stirring 14-year battle with breast cancer.         To the international surfing world, Ms. Sunn was the longboard champion who challenged the men on their own surf and helped make the sport safe for women as a founder of the first women's professional tour.         Hawaiians considered her a state treasure who used her fame to celebrate Hawaiian culture.         By the time her cancer was diagnosed in 1983, Ms. Sunn had established the credentials that would qualify her to become one of the first five women inducted into the International Surfing Museum's Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, Calif.         A native of Makaha, a small town on Oahu's leeward coast, about 25 miles northwest of Honolulu, Ms. Sunn grew up just three blocks from one of the world's most storied surfing beaches, a reef-ringed stretch of water where big waves abound and the surf is almost always up.         Riding a surfboard almost every day from the age of 4, Ms. Sunn entered her first amateur meet at 16, but quickly ran up against a hard fact of surfing life. Although women had surfed alongside men in Hawaii for centuries, since the arrival of Western missionaries in the 19th century their participation had been discouraged. In the 1950's, boys rode the boards, and girls stayed on the beach, tanning their bodies and looking good in bikinis.         With virtually no competition for women, Ms. Sunn entered men's events, almost always making the finals. By 1975, she and other pioneers, like Joyce Hoffman and Linda Benson, had inspired enough women to take up the sport that Ms. Sunn was able to help found the Women's Professional Surfing Association and establish the first professional tour for women.         Riding the waves around the world, she competed in California, Australia, South Africa, France and elsewhere. In 1982, she became the top-ranked woman on the longboard.         Ms. Sunn had a mastectomy, a bone marrow transplant and so much chemotherapy that she lost her luxuriant amber hair five times, but never her good humor. Typically, the only concession she would make to the disease was to wear a bathing cap when surfing.         After an impatient hospital stay she would wheedle permission from her doctors to return home, but only after they had made her promise to go straight to bed and stay there. As soon as she got home, Ms. Sunn would go straight to the beach. Surfing, she said, was the best therapy.         In October she was able to paddle around the island of Molokai with friends, but she weakened rapidly after that.         On New Year's Day, the woman who once described her cancer as ''the biggest wave ever,'' was taken to the beach on a stretcher to satisfy her last wish, to taste the sea on her lips one more time.         She died the next day, and two weeks later thousands of people gathered at Makaha Beach for a memorial service she had planned.         After her ashes were scattered over the water, several hundred surfers made a final ride with Ms. Sunn, whose middle name, Kapolioka'ehukai, means ''heart of the sea.''         Ms. Sunn, who was married three times, is survived by her husband, Dave Parmenter; a daughter, Jan Carreira of Los Angeles; her parents, Elbert and Roen Sunn of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii; a brother Eric of Makaha, and three sisters, Val Fenwick of Kailua-Kona, Anella Dehr of Makawao, Hawaii, and Kula Sunn of Haiku, Hawaii.       
         Dr. Jean Trepp McKelvey, who hurdled gender barriers in the field of labor-management mediation and opened the School of Industrial and Labor Relations at Cornell University, died on Jan. 5 at the Kirkhaven Nursing Home in her hometown of Rochester. She was 89.         She taught at Sarah Lawrence College for 13 years until 1946, when Cornell formed the new branch on its Ithaca, N.Y., campus and appointed her as its first faculty member. She wrote the curriculum for the school and taught courses in arbitration, labor law and labor practices.         She assumed emeritus status in 1976 but continued to teach and coordinate the school's off-campus graduate credit courses given under extension programs in Albany, Corning, Elmira, Rochester and Syracuse. In a tribute to her and another faculty member, the school, known by its initials, I.L.R., established its first endowed chair in 1994 and named it the Jean McKelvey-Alice Grant Professorship of Labor Management Relations.         Many of her former students went on to fill influential positions as union leaders, arbitrators and jurists. The year after she arrived at Cornell, she became a charter member -- and the sole woman at the time -- in the National Academy of Arbitrators. In 1970, she was the first woman to be elected president of the academy and, mindful of the overwhelming preponderance of men in her metier, came up with an arbitration training program for women.         Outside the classroom, Dr. McKelvey was a sought-after arbitrator for the airline industry as well as other sectors of the economy. Gov. W. Averell Harriman named her to the  State Board of Mediation in 1955, and she served on it for 11 years, helping settle thorny disputes like a wholesale butchers' strike in 1961.         President Richard M. Nixon appointed her to the Federal Services Impasses Panel in 1970, and she remained on it until eight years ago. At her death, she was still a member of the Public Review Board of the United Automobile Workers.         She was the author of many papers and books and edited the proceedings of several annual meetings of the National Academy of Arbitrators. Among her books were ''Cleared for Takeoff: Airline Labor Relations Since Deregulation'' (I.L.R. Press, 1988), ''The Changing Law of Fair Representation'' (I.L.R., 1985), ''New Challenges to Arbitration'' (I.L.R., 1977) and ''A.F.L. Attitudes Toward Production, 1900-1932'' (Greenwood, 1974).         She was born Jean Trepp in St. Louis and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley College in 1929. She received her M.A. and Ph.D. degrees from Radcliffe College in 1931 and 1933 and joined the Sarah Lawrence faculty in the year between. During World War II, she was a hearing officer and arbitrator for the National War Labor Board.         She is survived by her husband of 63 years, Blake McKelvey, Rochester's city historian emeritus, and a brother, Richard Trepp of Springfield, Mass.       
         Alice Marie Miel, an educator who was among the earliest to advance the notion that curriculum in the nation's classrooms should have a role in preparing children for the society they will enter as adults, died on Jan. 31 at the North Florida Regional Medical Center in Gainesville. She was 91.         Dr. Miel, a former resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan, moved to Gainesville after retiring from Teachers College at Columbia University in 1971.         As a professor of education and an author who specialized in curriculum development, Dr. Miel (pronounced mile) taught and left her imprint on the subject throughout the country and around the world.         She taught and wrote that a good teacher was a student with the world as the classroom. She set forth that approach in more than 10 books and other writings, beginning with the 1946 classic, ''Changing the Curriculum: A Social Process'' (Appleton). It counseled ''group solidarity and heterogeneity'' in curriculum development or, as she put it, ''diversity within unity.''         She believed that teachers must inspire their students to creativity and awareness of society at large even as they teach the basics. Her concern was that too many American children were growing up without a clue to their country's social and racial diversity. It was a conclusion that most of her peers had yet to reach.         She promoted the concept that education should be a vehicle toward a world community and intercultural understanding, beginning at home. In the book ''More Than Social Studies'' (Prentice-Hall, 1957) she coined the term ''social educator,'' whose classroom becomes ''a particular setting in which children can experience democratic living.''         She had particular trouble with the way children were being reared in the white suburbs of the 1960's, which she wrote about in a four-year study published in 1967, ''The Shortchanged Children of Suburbia.'' She concluded that these children were  being deprived of the ''rich diversity of American life,'' never knowing an African-American or poor youngster their own age.         Born on Feb. 21, 1906, in Six Lakes, Mich., she graduated in 1928 from the University of Michigan, where she earned a master's three years later. She received her doctorate in education at Teachers College in 1944.         Her career started in Ann Arbor, Mich. She taught elementary and secondary school and became a principal. Before she arrived at Teachers College, she was the curriculum coordinator for the public schools of Mount Pleasant, Mich.         In 1945, she was appointed a professor at Teachers College and staff researcher at the Horace Mann-Lincoln Institute of School Experimentation. In 1960, she took charge of the college's department of curriculum and teaching, which deals with education programs from the nursery to the college level.         Four years before she took emeritus status, Teachers College established Project Milestone for a ''re-look, revitalization and a recommitment to the central themes'' of Dr. Miel's thinking.         Dr. Miel is survived by two brothers, Homer Miel of Stanton, Mich., and Lucas S. Miel of Destin, Mich.       
         Margaret Hillis, who founded the Chicago Symphony Chorus and was the first woman to conduct the Chicago Symphony itself, died yesterday at Evanston Hospital, in Evanston, Ill. She was 76, and lived in Wilmette, Ill.         The cause was lung cancer, said Synneve Carlino, a spokeswoman for the Chicago Symphony.         Ms. Hillis, who appeared as a guest conductor with many American orchestras, including the National Symphony, the St. Louis Symphony, the Oregon Symphony and the Minnesota Orchestra, often said that orchestral conducting was her first love. She established herself as a choral conductor, however, because there were virtually no orchestral conducting opportunities for women when she began her career in the 1950's.         ''I learned to take a strong disadvantage and turn it to my advantage,'' she once said, and indeed, her work with the Chicago Symphony Chorus, as well as the choruses of the San Francisco Symphony and the Cleveland Orchestra, brought her considerable renown.         It also helped smooth her path to orchestral podiums. In 1957, when she started her chorus in Chicago, she made her conducting debut with the Chicago Symphony. She led the orchestra several times thereafter, both in Chicago and on tour         In 1977, she had a notable appearance as a last-minute substitute for Sir Georg Solti, who had fallen ill, in a performance of Mahler's Eighth Symphony at Carnegie Hall.         Ms. Hillis was born in Kokomo, Ind., in 1921. She began studying the piano when she was 5, but said that by the time she was 8 she began dreaming of becoming a conductor. She studied music at Indiana University in Bloomington, but suspended her studies during World War II to become a civilian flight instructor in Muncie, Ind.         After she completed her bachelor's degree in 1947, Ms. Hillis moved to New York, where she studied choral conducting with Robert Shaw at the Juilliard School. She soon became Mr. Shaw's assistant at the Collegiate Chorale, and in 1950 she founded the Tanglewood Alumni Chorus, which later performed as the New York Concert Choir and Orchestra.         In the 1950's she also worked as a choral conductor for the New York City Opera and the American Opera Society. During her years in New York she taught choral conducting at the Juilliard School and Union Theological Seminary, and she formed the American Choral Foundation, an organization that sought to raise the standards of choral performance.         The conductor Fritz Reiner invited her to start a chorus for the Chicago Symphony in 1957, and within a decade she had established one of the finest professional choirs in the country.         She also began working with community and regional orchestras, and was director for several years of the Kenosha Civic Orchestra, the Chicago Civic Orchestra and the Elgin Symphony. Starting in the late 1970's, she worked more actively as a guest conductor.         Although the directors of orchestral choirs do most of their work behind the scenes, rehearsing their choruses for performances conducted by the orchestra's music director or a guest conductor, Ms. Hillis's work with the Chicago Symphony Chorus was widely praised. She received Grammy awards for nine recordings for which she prepared the chorus for Mr. Solti, among them a Verdi Requiem, Beethoven's Missa Solemnis, two recordings of the Brahms German Requiem, Haydn's ''Creation'' and Bach's Mass in B minor.         Ms. Hillis is survived by three brothers: Elwood Hillis, a former Congressman, of Culver, Ind; Robert Hillis of Kokomo, and Joseph Hillis of Lafayette, Calif.         She had a sense of humor about her struggle for recognition in a profession dominated by men. ''There's only one woman I know who could never be a symphony conductor,'' she told The New York Times in 1979, ''and that's the Venus de Milo.''       
         Anne Sayre, a short story writer turned scientific sleuth who helped establish the important role played by the British crystallographer Rosalind Franklin in the discovery of the structure of DNA, died on Friday at a hospital near her home in Bridgewater, N.J. She was 74 and the author of the 1975 book ''Rosalind Franklin and DNA.''         Her husband, David, said the cause was scleroderma, a rare rheumatoid disorder.         Until Mrs. Sayre's book was published by Norton in 1975, Rosalind Franklin had been little more than a footnote to the history of the discovery of the double helix, the form taken by deoxyribonucleic acid, the stuff of heredity.         In their 1953 paper in the British journal Nature, James D. Watson and Francis H. C. Crick, who first constructed a model of the DNA molecule, barely mentioned Dr. Franklin and gave her none of the credit for their conceptual breakthrough.         A decade after Miss Franklin's death in 1958 and six years after he, Dr. Crick and Dr. Franklin's associate, Maurice Wilkins, won the Nobel Prize in 1962 for their work on DNA, Dr. Watson provided a hint of Dr. Franklin's contribution.         In his 1968 best-selling book ''The Double Helix,'' Dr. Watson acknowledged that he had seen a diffraction X-ray photograph of the DNA molecule taken by Dr. Franklin, but he left it unclear just what role the photograph had played in the discovery a few weeks later of the DNA structure.         That role might have remained a mystery if Dr. Watson had not provided such an unflattering portrait of Dr. Franklin that it outraged many international crystallographers.         It might yet have remained a mystery if within months of the book's publication, the world's crystallographers had not held their triennial meeting on Long Island, at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, practically next door to the Sayres' longtime home in the North Shore village of Head of the Harbor.         As it happened, Mrs. Sayre's husband, a crystallographer then working for I.B.M., was a host of the meeting, and he and his wife, who had met Dr. Franklin in Paris in the late 1940's, spent a lot of time listening to the visiting scientists complaining about Dr. Watson's portrayal of Dr. Franklin and speculating on whether her photograph had played a significant role in the discovery of the DNA structure.         At the urging of the crystallographers familiar with her work as a short story writer, Mrs. Sayre agreed to do a book on the subject. After years of research, including a stint in England, she produced the 1975 book. Among other things, it established that the Franklin photograph had been far more important than had been acknowledged in leading Dr. Watson and Dr. Crick to their discovery of the DNA structure.         Indeed, in Mrs. Sayre's book, Dr. Crick went so far as to suggest that Dr. Franklin was just weeks away from making the DNA discovery herself when her unscrupulous associate Dr. Wilkins showed the photograph to Dr. Watson without her permission.         Dr. Watson has since acknowledged the role played by the photograph in the DNA discovery, but has continued to disparage Dr. Franklin, saying yesterday that she had not been a real crystallographer and had missed the significance of her own photograph.         Nevertheless, Mrs. Sayre's book has been widely cited in feminist circles for helping to expose rampant sexism in science.         Mrs. Sayre was already familiar with sexism elsewhere in society.         Born on a train passing through Milwaukee, Mrs. Sayre, who grew up in Woodmere, N.Y., was a brilliant student who majored in government at Radcliffe, but was dissuaded by the sexual barriers of the day from going on to law school.         After holding a series of jobs in advertising and magazine publishing, Mrs. Sayre, who met her husband while working briefly at a radiation laboratory in Cambridge, turning out short stories, some of which were included in annual anthologies.         Before her 1975 book on Rosalind Franklin, Mrs. Sayre had written just one other book, a well-received 1957 book for teen-agers, ''Never Call Retreat,'' about a Quaker family living in the South during Reconstruction.         Working on the Rosalind Franklin book helped prompt Mrs. Sayre to redress an old feminist complaint of her own.         She received her law degree from New York University, worked for a while as a volunteer Legal Aid lawyer in Riverhead, N.Y., then in the late 1980's became town justice in Head of the Harbor, a post she held until illness forced her to step down in 1996.         Her husband is her only survivor.         Editor's Note:  July 8, 1998, Wednesday  An obituary on March 18 about Anne Sayre, an author, described a book she wrote in 1975 about the role of Rosalind Franklin, a British biologist, in the discovery of the structure of DNA 45 years ago. The article recounted an incident in 1952 in which Maurice Wilkins, a colleague of Dr. Franklin's, showed other scientists in the field an X-ray photograph she had taken.         In describing the incident, the article called Dr. Wilkins ''her unscrupulous associate.'' While some biologists question the prudence of what he did with her photograph, the consensus is that it was not unscrupulous. The term should not have appeared.         This note was delayed by an editing lapse.       
         Rose Steinberg Stamler, a pioneer in the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure and a professor emeritus of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Medical School, died on Feb. 28 at Scottsdale Memorial Hospital in Arizona. She was 75 and lived in Chicago.         The cause was heart failure, said her husband, Dr. Jeremiah Stamler, also a professor emeritus at the school.         Beginning in 1958, Professor Stamler, a sociologist by training, and her husband, a cardiovascular specialist, conducted studies to identify risk factors linked to heart disease. The studies have established the basis for others that have found that a change in life style, like quitting smoking and controlling high blood pressure through proper diet and exercise, can improve longevity.         Professor Stamler was also involved in other research projects, including a survey of more than 10,000 people worldwide that reaffirmed sodium as a factor in high blood pressure.         At her death, Professor Stamler was involved in a study to examine how protein, carbohydrates and fats in the diet affect blood pressure, said Alan Dyer, associate chairman of the department of preventive medicine at the medical school.         In addition to her husband, Professor Stamler is survived by a son, Paul J., of St. Louis, and a sister, Gertrude Asher of the Bronx.       
         Augusta Braxston Baker, a spellbinding storyteller, editor and former custodian of the children's section at the New York Public Library, died on Feb. 23 at Baptist Medical Center in Columbia, S.C. A Columbia resident since 1980, she was 86 and formerly lived in St. Albans, Queens.         Mrs. Baker was associated with the New York Public Library for 37 years, until her retirement in 1974 as coordinator of children's services and supervisor of storytelling for all its branches. She also conducted a weekly broadcast, ''The World of Children's Literature,'' on WNYC radio in the 1970's and continued as a visiting lecturer on library sciences at Columbia University until 1979.         After moving to the South, she became the storyteller in residence at the University of South Carolina.  Columbia established a yearly storytelling festival in her honor in 1987,  called ''A(ugusta) Baker's Dozen,'' and the Association of Library Services to Children of the American Library Association in 1993 cited her for a Distinguished Services Award, its highest tribute to a member.         Mrs. Baker was admired as someone who could enchant children and their parents alike. Over the years she also reviewed children's books for The New York Times and was a  judge of its Book Review's list of best-illustrated books.         In 1941, she printed her first listing of books about black life. Teachers and librarians kept it current as a guide for all library visitors. Mrs. Baker usually reviewed about 150 to 200 books for her list.         She was a past chairwoman of the Newbery Caldecott Committee, which bestows medals each year on the authors and illustrators of the children's books deemed the most distinguished. With Ellin Greene, she wrote ''Storytelling: Art and Technique.''         Mrs. Baker suggested that a parent start with books of folk and fairy tales to be retold while sitting comfortably on a living room rug or under a shade tree in the park, preferably without interruptions. It is the voice that counts, she said, and it  must be pleasing, flexible and enthusiastic enough to add drama to the story line, though overly dramatic gestures ought to be avoided.         ''Naturally, we try to entertain:  that is the heart of all storytelling,'' she told an interviewer in 1955. ''But our initial purpose is to teach the child to listen. Through this approach we try to strengthen his literary awareness.''         She was born in Baltimore and graduated in 1933 from what is now the State University of New York at Albany, where she received a degree in library science the next year.         She joined the New York Public Library in 1937 as a children's librarian for its Countee Cullen Branch in Harlem.         While at the Harlem branch she helped build its James Weldon Johnson Collection of quality books about the black experience and in 1946 compiled a bibliography, ''Books About Negro Life for Children.''         She advanced to the main branch in 1961 as assistant coordinator and storytelling expert and was named  coordinator of children's services in 1961.         She was divorced from her first husband, James Henry Baker Jr., who died in 1956. Her second husband, Gordon Alexander, died in 1987 after 43 years of marriage.         She is survived by a son, James Henry Baker 3d of Columbia, and two granddaughters.       
         Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the widow of John Hay (Jock) Whitney, the first wife of James Roosevelt and the last of the three glamorous Cushing sisters of Boston, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 89.         Mrs. Whitney was one of the most prestigious figures in New York society, although she disliked publicity and rarely attended large social gatherings. When she did appear at an event, it was considered a coup.         In recent years, in failing health, Mrs. Whitney, a prominent philanthropist in medicine and art, spent most of her time at Greentree, one of the most magnificent private residences in the country, situated on 438 acres in Manhasset, on Long Island's Gold Coast. There, surrounded by an important Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art collection, gardens and greenhouses, Mrs. Whitney was looked after by 20 employees.         Mrs. Whitney was the second-born of the three Cushing sisters, who were renowned in the 1930's and 40's for their brilliant marriages into some of the most prominent families in the country. She inherited the bulk of one of the great American fortunes when Jock Whitney -- sportsman, financier, publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, philanthropist, political mover and shaker, and Ambassador to Britain -- died in 1982. In 1990, Forbes magazine estimated her wealth at $700 million.         Practicing the Art Of Marrying Well         From their debutante days, she and her sisters were celebrated by society chroniclers for their beauty and charm. Her older sister, Mary (Minnie) Cushing, was married to Vincent Astor, the wealthy real estate owner, and after a divorce, to James Whitney Fosburgh, an artist. She died in 1978 at 72. Barbara (Babe) Cushing, the youngest, was married to Stanley Mortimer Jr., a grandson of one of the founders of Standard Oil, and after a divorce, to William S. Paley, the legendary founder and chairman of the Columbia Broadcasting System.         Babe Paley, a perennial name on the world's best-dressed list and a glittering figure in society, also died in 1978, at 62, four months before her older sister.         Betsey Maria Cushing was born in Baltimore on May 18, 1908. Her father was Dr. Harvey Cushing, a neurosurgeon who was a professor of surgery at various times at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities. Her mother was Katherine Crowell Cushing, of a socially prominent family in Cleveland.         Dr. Cushing was a stern father, and Mrs. Whitney later recalled that ''perfectionism was drummed into us.'' The social skills that she learned at Miss May's, a private day school in Boston, and at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn., were burnished by her mother, who made certain that her daughters excelled in the arts of entertaining and running a household as prerequisites for the advantageous marriages she was determined they would have.         David Grafton, the author of the 1992 book ''The Sisters: The Lives and Times of the Fabulous Cushing Sisters'' (Villard Books), wrote that Katherine Cushing once told a gossip columnist that she expected her girls ''to marry into the highest level of European nobility or into America's moneyed aristocracy.''         There were also two brothers, William and Henry, neither of whom survives.         Although marriage into the Roosevelt family did not apparently meet her highest expectations, it merited no objections. Betsey Cushing met James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, when she was 22.         They married at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Brookline, Mass., on June 5, 1930, two days before the bridegroom's graduation from Harvard. Five hundred leaders of the social and political worlds of Boston and New York watched the bride, in a floor-length gown of silver lame, exchange vows with the son of the Governor of New York and his wife. Elliott Roosevelt was his brother's best man, and two other brothers, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. and John A. Roosevelt, were among the ushers. Minnie Cushing was the maid of honor, and Babe Cushing was a bridesmaid.         As a young married woman, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt ''could be imperious,'' the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst later told Mr. Paley's biographer, Sally Bedell Smith. But,  Ms. Smith wrote, ''Fortunately, Betsey redeemed herself with a rollicking sense of humor and an ability to kick up her heels.''         Not Exactly a Favorite Of Eleanor Roosevelt         The young Roosevelts spent their early married life living with the Cushings, while the bridegroom studied law at the Boston University Law School. When Mr. Roosevelt went into the insurance business, the couple bought a house and property in Framingham, Mass. After his father became President of the United States and chose him as an aide, the couple lived in Georgetown.         The young Mrs. Roosevelt was said to be the President's favorite daughter-in-law, but she enjoyed no such preference from Eleanor Roosevelt and was, in turn, not fond of her mother-in-law. ''The two women were simply too strong and too different in personal style and social preferences,'' Mr. Grafton wrote.         Betsey Roosevelt was often the hostess at the White House when Eleanor Roosevelt was absent. She was in the forefront on a summer day in 1939 when the President entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic in Hyde Park, N.Y., at which the King ate his first hot dog. Later that day, when the President took the King and Queen for a drive along the Hudson River, the President asked Betsey Roosevelt to go along for company in the car.         Always family-conscious, she enhanced Babe Cushing's debutante season by giving a tea dance at the White House as a second coming-out party. She also introduced Minnie Cushing to Vincent Astor, and the two were married in 1940 after Mr. Astor divorced his first wife.         Even as a member of the President's circle, Betsey Roosevelt preferred a private life, and she did her best to shield her two daughters, Sara and Kate, from the public eye.         In November 1938, James Roosevelt left the Government and went to Hollywood to work in the movie business as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. His wife followed him, but they separated, and early in 1940 it was disclosed that they were to be divorced. Mr. Roosevelt filed for divorce on grounds of desertion, and his wife filed a cross-complaint on grounds of desertion and cruelty.         In March 1940, Mrs. Roosevelt obtained a divorce decree. She was given custody of the children, child support, a settlement and further payments until she remarried.         Mr. Roosevelt went on to become a decorated Marine officer in World War II, a six-term Congressman from California and a delegate to the United Nations during the Johnson Administration. He died in 1991.         Early in 1942, rumors of a romance between Betsey Cushing Roosevelt and Jock Whitney began circulating in New York, Boston and Washington. He had been divorced in 1940 after 10 years of marriage to the former Mary Elizabeth Altemus.         The couple were married in a small, informal ceremony on March 1, 1942, in her widowed mother's East 86th Street apartment. The bride was 33 and the bridegroom 37.         After a honeymoon at Greenwood Plantation in Thomasville, Ga., one of Mr. Whitney's many residences, the newlyweds moved to Washington, where he ran the motion picture division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, headed by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Whitney later joined the Air Force, rose to colonel, was a German prisoner for 18 days in 1944 before escaping and got several decorations.         In 1949, Mr. Whitney adopted his wife's two daughters. The Whitneys moved to London in 1957, when President Eisenhower named Mr. Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Mrs. Whitney renewed her friendship with the Queen Mother, whom she had met on the 1939 visit to America. Both Ambassador and Mrs. Whitney became close to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.         Mrs. Whitney spent a good deal of her time making the Whitney residences comfortable and welcoming. In his book, Mr. Grafton quoted a friend of hers as saying, ''The Jock Whitneys are just about as 'down-to-earth' as any people can be with a quarter of a billion dollars.''         White House Is Nice, But It's No Greentree         The residences that Mrs. Whitney had at her disposal over the years included, in addition to Greentree on Long Island and the plantation in Georgia, a town house and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island near New London, Conn.; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races there; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Ga., and a spacious house in Surrey, England, not far from the Ascot racecourse.         E. J. Kahn, Mr. Whitney's biographer, reported that years later one of the daughters, Kate, once took her own children on a tour of the White House. Mr. Kahn wrote, ''After inspecting it, they pronounced it nice enough but hardly on a par with Greentree.''         In addition, the Whitneys shared a renowned Kentucky horse farm, which also bore the name Greentree, with Mr. Whitney's sister, Joan Whitney Payson. It was later sold.         Mrs. Whitney established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups, and she was its president. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950's on 15 acres donated by Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Payson.         Mrs. Whitney was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art, Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. The Modern received eight major paintings, by artists like Utrillo, Picasso and Seurat, from Mr. Whitney's estate, and Yale received six paintings, valued at $5 million at that time. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center received a $15 million gift.         After her husband's death in 1982, Mrs. Whitney gave $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art got nine American and French paintings, which had been placed in a charitable trust during Mr. Whitney's lifetime. The trust also gave $2 million for acquisitions, and Mrs. Whitney chose a Toulouse-Lautrec painting from her husband's collection, ''Marcelle Lender Dancing the Bolero in 'Chilperic,' '' to give the gallery in his memory.         Mrs. Whitney made art history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene ''At the Moulin de la Galette.'' It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction.         Among Mrs. Whitney's many public activities were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service.         She is survived by her daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, both of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Linda Schele, a onetime studio art teacher who made a fateful vacation visit to Mexico that turned her life upside down and helped revolutionize Mayan scholarship, died on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Austin, Tex. She was 55 and widely known for her pioneering work in decoding inscriptions on Mayan monuments.         Her husband, David, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.         A native of Nashville who obtained a bachelor's degree in education and a master's in fine arts from the University of Cincinnati in 1968, Dr. Schele (SHE-lee) was more or less contentedly teaching studio art at the University of South Alabama in Mobile when her husband, a Cincinnati-trained architect who had long been fascinated with pre-Columbian architecture, suggested that the couple spend their 1970 Christmas vacation visiting Mayan ruins in Mexico.         A woman of infectious enthusiasm, Dr. Schele, who had no special interest in the Mayan civilization, threw herself into the project, securing a grant to take photographs for the university collection and recruiting three art students for the trip.         As the travelers began their tour, they were persuaded to make a slight detour from their itinerary to spend a couple of hours visiting the ruins at the Mayan city of Palenque.         When they got there, Dr. Schele was so taken with the breathtaking beauty of the site and so enthralled by the scholars she encountered there that the 2-hour visit stretched to 12 days. By the time she got back to Mobile she had a new life's work.         She remained at South Alabama until she had obtained a doctorate in Latin American studies from the University of Texas and become a professor of art there in 1981, but Dr. Schele spent virtually every spare moment at Palenque and other Mayan sites.         Although the Mayans, who flourished from about A.D. 200 to 900, had long been recognized for their scientific work in devising a calendar based on advanced astronomical observations, they had been largely dismissed by scholars as sort of idiot savants, an illiterate nation of indolent stargazers who devoted all their considerable mathematical and intellectual resources simply to marking time. They were also seen as a blissfully peaceful people, whose fabled cities lacked even rudimentary fortifications.         As for the abundant carvings and glyphs on the countless monuments among the ruins, scholars had assumed these were variously religious symbols or arcane notations denoting the movement of planets.         The view had persisted even though a 16th century Spanish priest had done important though long-ignored work suggesting that the glyphs constituted an actual language and though a spate of recent work, derided by established scholars, had even worked out the syntax of the language, in which individual glyphs represented syllables of complex words.         It was at a meeting of scholars at Palenque in 1973 that Dr. Schele emerged as a leader of a revisionist school of Mayan scholarship. When it was suggested that she and a young Calgary University student at the meeting, Peter Matthews, try to translate the inscriptions on the monuments at Palenque, it took the pair only three hours to discover that the inscriptions provided an incredibly detailed history of the Palenque dynasty.         Over the next dozen years, Dr. Schele and others deciphered and interpreted inscriptions throughout the Mayan realm, but it was not until 1986, when Dr. Schele helped organize an exhibition at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth that the world learned the full implications of the work: Far from being an ethereal peaceful people, the Mayans were a warring nation who tortured and sometimes sacrificed their captives, whose nobles engaged in blood-letting rituals to placate their gods and whose king was required to stick a rod through the shaft of his own penis on ceremonial occasions.         A scholar who shared her own research generously and who organized annual conferences that became a focus of Mayan research, Dr. Schele collaborated on a series of important books, among them ''The Blood of Kings'' (1986, Braziller), ''A Forest of Kings'' (1990, Morrow), ''Maya Cosmos'' (1993, Morrow) and ''The Code of Kings'' (1998, Scribner.)         In recent years the woman who helped decipher a language and discover a history of a once mighty civilization had held workshops to teach the Mayan descendants how to read the language of their ancestors.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Schele is survived by a brother, Tom Richmond of Chicago.       
         Barbara Burton Elliott, the founder and executive director of Il Piccolo Teatro dell'Opera, a small New York opera company that gave performances in Brooklyn and Manhattan, died on Saturday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 63 and lived in Brooklyn.         Her son Drew said the cause was complications from leukemia.         Ms. Elliott started her company in 1984 with the idea of nurturing young singers and developing new audiences. Her staging of Rameau's ''Platee'' at the Brooklyn Academy of Music gave the soprano Renee Fleming one of her first starring roles in New York. Other singers who worked with the company on their way to establishing their international careers were Douglas Perry and Jianyi Zhang.         Notable productions of the company include Puccini's ''Villi,'' Britten's ''Rape of Lucretia,'' ''Midsummer Night's Dream'' and ''Noye's Fludde,'' Weill's ''Threepenny Opera'' and an annual staging for children of Menotti's ''Amahl and the Night Visitors.'' She gave an annual series of free summer concerts in Prospect Park in Brooklyn as well as performances at Riverside Church and the Church of the Virgin Mary in Manhattan.         Her educational efforts included a program called Create, an acronym for Collaborative Resources for the Education and Artistic Training of Every Child, and the Brooklyn Children's Chorus. She took music and dance programs to public schools in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx.         Ms. Elliott had a knack for persuading established stars to support her cause. Tony Randall and Paul Sorvino narrated her production of Puccini's ''Villi,'' and Luciano Pavarotti, Samuel Ramey, Gian Carlo Menotti and Mirella Freni appeared at benefit dinners for the Piccolo Teatro.         In addition to her son Drew, of Brooklyn, she is survived by her husband, Donald; two other sons, Douglas, of Brooklyn and Steven, of Glen Ridge, N.J.; her mother, Eunice Burton of Austin, Minn.; a sister, Victoria Swedish of Madison, Wis.; a brother, Robert, of Indianapolis and four grandchildren.         Correction:  April 27, 1998, Monday  An obituary on Thursday about Barbara Burton Elliott, executive director of Il Piccolo Teatro dell' Opera, misidentified a church in Manhattan where the company has performed. It is the Church of St. Mary the Virgin, not the Church of the Virgin Mary.       
         Tammy Wynette, whose 1968 hit ''Stand By Your Man'' established her as a queen of country music, died yesterday in her sleep at her home in Nashville. She was 55.         Ms. Wynette had a history of health problems. The cause of death  was believed to be a blood clot, said Evelyn Shriver, a spokeswoman for the singer.         In her 25-year career, Ms. Wynette recorded more than 50 albums and sold more than 30 million recordings. ''Stand By Your Man'' made her  synonymous with the role of a long-suffering but determinedly loyal wife, holding the family together even when her husband strayed.         Her voice had a husky center, with melancholy balanced by determination; she sounded like an Everywoman with unexpected reserves of strength and affection. Working with  Billy Sherrill as producer, she also became the standard-bearer of an elaborately orchestrated Nashville sound, with pedal steel guitars underlined by strings and backup choruses.         Ms. Wynette's own life was more turbulent, and less stable, than the lifelong attachments her songs promised.         She was born Wynette Pugh in 1942 in rural Itawumba County, Miss., and was raised by her grandparents on a farm where she picked cotton. She was drawn to music and learned to play guitar before she became a teen-ager, when she joined her mother in Birmingham, Ala.         A month before her high school graduation in 1959, she was married for the first time, to Euple Byrd. She had three daughters with him: Gwen, Jackie and Tina. The couple was divorced in 1965.         In 1963, she had enrolled in beautician's school in Tupelo, Miss. Working by day as a beautician and at night as a singer in clubs, she began appearing on local television and then on Porter Wagoner's syndicated country television show.         In 1966, she moved to Nashville and auditioned for Mr. Sherrill, who signed her to Epic Records. He renamed her Tammy Wynette and recorded some honky-tonk-flavored songs, including the ballad ''Apartment No. Nine'' and the uptempo ''Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad,'' her first Top 10 hit, in 1967. ''I Don't Wanna Play House'' reached No. 1 on the country charts and brought her a Grammy award. She married a second time, to Don Chapel, a singer, but the marriage lasted only a year.         Her three No. 1 hits in 1968 -- ''Stand By Your Man,'' ''Take Me To Your World'' and ''D-I-V-O-R-C-E'' -- established both her public image and her style, concentrating on weepers about holding a marriage together and unending love. ''Stand By Your Man,'' written by Ms. Wynette and Mr. Sherrill, sold more than two million copies.         As the song moved from country radio stations to the pop Top 20, she married George Jones, the country singer who had been her idol. ''Stand By Your Man'' brought her a second Grammy Award as well as recognition from the Country Music Association as female vocalist of the year in 1969 and 1970. She and Mr. Jones had a daughter, Georgette, in 1970.         Through the 1970's, she recorded duets with Mr. Jones, even continuing after they were divorced in 1975; the duo had No. 1 country hits with ''Golden Ring'' and ''Near You.'' In 1976, she married and divorced Michael Tomlin.         Two years later, she married George Richey, with whom she wrote the song '' 'Til I Can Make It on My Own.'' Her autobiography, ''Stand By Your Man,'' was published in 1979.         Her career fluctuated in the 1980's, with Top 10 hits including ''Another Chance'' in 1982 and ''Sometimes When We Touch,'' a duet with Mark Gray, in 1985. She acted in the soap opera ''Capitol'' in 1986, but also spent part of the year at the Betty Ford clinic fighting an addiction to prescription painkillers. She was recognized as a major figure in country music, with younger performers, including Emmylou Harris and Vince Gill, appearing on her albums. Although her hits reached the Top 20 less often, her voice was immediately recognizable. In 1992, she had an unexpected international hit when she sang ''Justified and Ancient'' with the English electronic dance group, the KLF; the song reached No. 1 in 18 countries.         Ms. Wynette became a part of the 1992 Presidential campaign after Hillary Rodham Clinton, stressing that her support of her husband was more than routine, told an interviewer, ''I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.''         Ms. Wynette demanded, and received, an apology. Ms. Wynette said Mrs. Clinton had ''offended every true country music fan'' and every person who has ''made it on their own with no one to take them to a White House.''         Ms. Wynette later performed at a Clinton fund-raiser.         In 1993, Ms. Wynette teamed with Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn to record the album ''Honky-Tonk Angels.'' She was hospitalized in 1994 for stomach problems but returned to touring soon afterward.         Her last album, ''One,'' released in 1996, was a reunion with Mr. Jones.         Ms. Wynette had performed as recently as two weeks ago, and had been preparing for a live performance on May 8 on TNN with Melissa Etheridge and Trisha Yearwood, said Ms. Shriver, her spokeswoman.         She is survived by her husband, George Richey; five daughters, Jackie Daly, Gwen Ignaczak and Tina Jones, all of Nashville, Georgette Smith of Alabama and Deirdre Richardson of Los Angeles; a son, Kelly Richardson of San Francisco,  and seven grandchildren.

         Tammy Wynette, whose 1968 hit ''Stand By Your Man'' established her as a queen of country music, died on Monday in her sleep at her home in Nashville. She was 55.         She recorded more than 50 albums and sold more than 30 million recordings. Ms. Wynette, who had a history of health problems, is believed to have died of a blood clot, said her publicist, Evelyn Shriver.         ''Stand By Your Man'' established Ms. Wynette in the role of a long-suffering but determinedly loyal wife, holding the family together even when her husband strayed. Her voice had a husky center, with melancholy balanced by determination; she sounded like an Everywoman with unexpected reserves of strength and affection. ''I'm not the best singer in the world, just the loudest,'' she once declared.         Working with the producer Billy Sherrill, with whom she wrote her biggest hit, she also became the standard-bearer of an elaborately orchestrated Nashville sound, with pedal steel guitars underlined by strings and backup choruses.         She became the first female country singer to have a million-selling album, and she had 20 No. 1 country hit singles in her career. But her own life was more turbulent, and less stable, than the lifelong attachments her songs promised.         She was born in 1942 in rural Itawamba County, Miss., named Virginia Wynette Pugh, and raised by her grandparents on a farm where she picked cotton. She was drawn to music, and learned to play guitar before her teen-age years, when she joined her mother in Birmingham, Ala.         A month before her high school graduation in 1959, she was married for the first time, to Euple Byrd. She had three daughters with him: Gwen, Jackie and Tina. In 1963, she enrolled in beautician's school in Tupelo, Miss.; she was divorced in 1965. Working by day as a beautician and at night as a singer in clubs, she began appearing on a local television program, the ''Country Boy Eddie Show,'' then on Porter Wagoner's nationally syndicated country television show.         In 1966, she moved to Nashville and auditioned for Mr. Sherrill, who signed her to Epic Records. He renamed her Tammy Wynette and recorded some honky-tonk-flavored songs: the ballad ''Apartment No. Nine'' and the uptempo ''Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad,'' her first Top 10 hit, in 1967. ''I Don't Wanna Play House'' reached No. 1 on the country charts and brought her a Grammy Award.         The three No. 1 hits she had in 1968 -- ''Stand By Your Man,'' ''Take Me to Your World'' and ''D-I-V-O-R-C-E'' -- established both her public image and her style, concentrating on weepers about holding a marriage together or declaring her unending love. ''Stand By Your Man'' sold more than two million copies. In it, she sang: ''Sometimes it's hard to be a woman, giving all your love to just one man. You'll have bad times and he'll have good times doin' things that you don't understand. But if you love him, you'll forgive him even though he's hard to understand. And if you love him, oh be proud of him 'cause after all he's just a man.''         She had married the songwriter Don Chapel in 1967, but the partnership lasted only a year. It ended when Ms. Wynette walked out on her husband to live with George Jones, the revered and, at the time, hard-drinking country singer. According to Mr. Jones's autobiography, ''I Lived to Tell It All'' (1996), he had fallen in love with Ms. Wynette while they were on tour together.         One night, visiting her at home, he walked in while she and her husband were having an argument. After kicking over a dining room table, Mr. Jones declared his love for her, and Ms. Wynette and her three daughters left Mr. Chapel that night. A day later, Mr. Jones and Ms. Wynette flew to Mexico for a quick divorce, only to find out on their return that Tennessee did not recognize Mexican divorces. Mr. Chapel sued Mr. Jones for alienation of affection and Ms. Wynette for divorce. But Mr. Jones's lawyers discovered that Mr. Chapel and Ms. Wynette had married illegally, because she had married too soon after her previous divorce.         As ''Stand By Your Man'' moved from country radio stations to the pop Top 20, Ms. Wynette married Mr. Jones in 1969, and they began billing themselves as ''Mr. and Mrs. Country Music.'' They moved to Lakeland, Fla.         ''Stand By Your Man'' brought Ms. Wynette a second Grammy Award as well as recognition from the Country Music Association; she was named female vocalist of the year in 1969 and 1970. She and Mr. Jones had a daughter, Georgette, in 1970. But the marriage was a troubled one. In her 1979 autobiography, ''Stand By Your Man,'' Ms. Wynette wrote that one night he menaced her with a rifle while in a drunken rage, firing in her direction as she ran from him and then shooting up their Lakeland mansion; his autobiography denies the account. The next morning, he was straitjacketed and hospitalized for 10 days.         From 1971 to 1980, she recorded duets with Mr. Jones. Among them were songs like ''We're Gonna Hold On,'' which appeared amid reports of their marital troubles and rumors of impending divorce. The duo had No. 1 country hits with ''Golden Ring'' and ''Near You.'' But their marriage could not survive Mr. Jones's drinking and the couple's increasingly bitter quarrels. In 1975 they were divorced, although they continued to record duets. Ms. Wynette married Michael Tomlin in 1976, then divorced him after 44 days. Two years later, she married George Richey, with whom she wrote the song '' 'Til I Can Make It on My Own.''         Ms. Wynette's career fluctuated in the 1980's, with Top 10 hits including ''Another Chance'' in 1982 and ''Sometimes When We Touch,'' a duet with Mark Gray, in 1985. She acted in the soap opera ''Capitol'' in 1986. But she also spent part of the year at the Betty Ford Clinic fighting an addiction to prescription painkillers. She was recognized as a major figure in country music, with younger performers including Emmylou Harris and Vince Gill appearing on her albums, but her songs reached the Top 20 less often.         Yet her voice was immediately recognizable. In 1992, she had an unexpected international hit when she sang ''Justified and Ancient'' with the English electronic dance group, the KLF. The song reached No. 1 in 18 countries.         In 1992, her name and best-known song entered the Presidential campaign when Hillary Rodham Clinton, stressing that her defense of her husband against charges of adultery was more than routine, said in a ''60 Minutes'' interview: ''I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.''         Ms. Wynette demanded, and received, an apology, declaring that Mrs. Clinton had ''offended every true country music fan'' and every person who has ''made it on their own with no one to take them to a White House.'' After the apology, Ms. Wynette performed at a Clinton fund-raiser. ''Her trademark style has filled our hearts and made her a legend,'' President Clinton said yesterday.         In 1993, Ms. Wynette made an album, ''Honky-Tonk Angels,'' with Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn. She was hospitalized in 1994 with an infection that left her in critical condition for a week. But she returned to touring and recording soon afterward, including a guest appearance on Elton John's album ''Duets.'' Her last recordings reunited her with Mr. Jones to sing duets on the 1996 album ''One.''         In addition to her husband, George Richey, she is survived by five daughters, Jackie Daly, Gwen Ignaczak and Tina Jones, all of Nashville, Georgette Smith of Alabama and Deirdre Richardson of Los Angeles; a son, Kelly Richardson of San Francisco and seven grandchildren.

         Dr. Emily Mudd, a onetime college dropout who trained to be a landscape architect before the trajectory of her life and her own inner fire led her to become a pioneering marriage and family counselor, died on Saturday at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 99 and widely regarded as a giant of the field she helped create.         At a time when more than 25,000 American marriage counselors treat some 2 million troubled marriages a year, it might seem a shade surprising that in 1933, when Mrs. Mudd helped form the Philadelphia Marriage Council, the field was so new there were only two other such organizations in the country.         There were also no established training programs for marriage counselors, which might help explain why her fellow organizers asked Mrs. Mudd to run the Philadelphia program even though she did not have an academic degree.         But she did have a few other credentials. For one thing, she and her husband, Stuart, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, had helped start Pennsylvania's first birth control clinic six years earlier, and her experiences there dealing with often overburdened and sometimes abused wives had led her to see the need for broader family counseling.         Then, too, Mrs. Mudd was the only wife and mother among the academics and social work specialists who met at the Mudds' home to plan the marriage council.         The men were so impressed with their hostess's drive, insights, intuition and commitment that after an elaborate search for a qualified professional, they decided she would be the best person to run the council. It certainly would have been hard to find anyone more dedicated to social change and human improvement.         As a student at Vassar when the United States entered World War I, she was so determined to do her part for the cause that she helped form a Vassar unit of the women's Land Army, established to have women work the fields in place of mobilized farmers.         Her own role in that unit and as a Vassar student came to an end when she drank some fetid water, developed typhoid fever and was advised to avoid stuffy classrooms and seek a career in the fresh air. Accordingly, she studied landscape architecture at a school in Groton, Mass., but before she could begin a career she was diverted by romance.         After her marriage in 1922, Mrs. Mudd spent a decade as her husband's unpaid laboratory assistant, first at Harvard, later at the Rockefeller Institute in New York and then at the Henry Phipps Institute in Philadelphia, winning credit as co-author of 14 of his scientific papers.         After being asked to run the new Philadelphia Marriage Council, she returned to college. Working part time until she obtained a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, Mrs. Mudd, who eventually received her doctorate there, became the council's full-time executive director in 1936 and held the post until her retirement in 1967.         Along the way she helped lay the groundwork for virtually every aspect of professional marriage and family counseling. She formed one of the first counselor training programs, developed the first program to measure counselor effectiveness, wrote several textbooks and lectured widely here and abroad.         Only the third woman to be named to the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school, Dr. Mudd, who later became the first woman to become a full professor there, taught the first course at an American medical school dealing with sexuality, a speciality that led her to help edit Alfred Kinsey's book on female sexuality and to work closely with the Masters and Johnson clinic in St. Louis, to which she contributed thousands of case histories from her own practice.         After her retirement from the Philadelphia Marriage Council, now affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Mudd, who remarried after her first husband's death in 1975, continued to see patients well into her 80's. She also found time to pursue her old landscaping speciality by developing elaborate gardens at her suburban home.         She is survived by two sons, John, of Cambridge, Mass., and Harvey, of Bethesda, Md.; two daughters, Margaret, of Cold Spring, N.Y., and Emily Mitchell of Concord, Mass.; 10 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Emily Whaley, a South Carolina woman with a green thumb and such an eye for color that she helped show flowering Charleston there was bloom beyond azaleas and camellias and turned her backyard into one of the nation's most acclaimed private gardens, died on Monday at her summer home in Flat Rock, N.C. She was 87 and had become something of celebrity since the publication of a memoir, ''Mrs. Whaley and her Charleston Garden,'' last year.         Her family said the cause was a stroke.         No one would mistake Mrs. Whaley's garden for, say, Longwood Gardens, but as home gardens go, the one she maintained for more than 50 years on a 30-foot by 100-foot plot behind her narrow 1754 white clapboard house at 58 Church Street, a block from the harbor in Charleston's historic district, has been a perennial eye-popper.         Among other things it has been featured in books by Rosemary Vaerey and other garden writers and has been a fixture on the Historic Charleston Foundation's annual garden tours.         The garden has been considered special partly because it was laid out in 1941 by a renowned landscape architect, Loutrell Briggs, who took full advantage of a brick carriage house, a couple of mighty oaks and a magnolia tree on neighboring properties as backdrops of opportunity for a design that included five distinct gardens, or ''rooms,'' as Mrs. Whaley called them.         But mainly it was because Mrs. Whaley filled the Briggs design with repeated flair, adding a statue here, ripping out a bed of plants there and forever experimenting with new plants in varied combinations.         That was not, to be sure, because she hadn't gotten it right the first time, but because her tastes changed every few years.         Until her book, billed as ''a conversation with William Baldwin,'' a  South Carolina novelist, was published by Algonquin Books last year, Mrs. Whaley's fame had been largely local, but well established.         One of the first local gardeners to dare to plant for year-round blooms in a city whose signature azaleas and camellias lose their blossoms in the torrid Charleston summers, Mrs. Whaley helped establish a trend of planting perennials like roses, gerbera daisies and hydrangeas, in front of the towering azalea and camellia shrubs.         She was also one of the first to open her garden to the public to raise money for charities, a practice that attracted some 3,000 paying visitors a year and led some to call her garden the most visited private garden in the country.         For Mrs. Whaley, an accomplished pianist and ballroom dancer who helped start the Cotillion, a dancing school that has become a Charleston social fixture, and once taught chess, gardening came more than naturally. It was, she liked to say, in her genes.         The daughter of a country doctor, Mrs. Whaley was born Emily Kershaw in Pinopolis, a village about 40 miles west of Charleston, and spent part of her childhood at her mother's family's Belvidere Plantation, helping her mother tend a 13-acre garden even as her mother had helped her mother garden.         After attending the University of Georgia she married Ben Scott Whaley, who became a prominent Charleston lawyer, served a term in the state legislature, was United States Attorney for Charleston in the Truman Administration and played a crucial role in creating his wife's garden.         With his wife confined to bed during a difficult pregnancy in the summer of 1941, Mr. Whaley asked if there was some special present she would like. She said yes, a garden designed by Loutrell Briggs.         It took a few years for Mrs. Whaley to turn the Briggs blueprint into an actual garden, but once she got it growing, she did not neglect it.         Working for several hours a day with her longtime assistant, Junior Robinson, she was a demon for pruning, a necessity in such a small garden with narrow brick walks.         Mrs. Whaley was not sentimental about her plantings. Let a row of Italian cypresses grow too tall for her tastes and whack, they would be gone.         A woman so attuned to the subtleties of nature that she was forever commenting on the weather and could become ecstatic over the feel of a gentle breeze on the back of her neck, Mrs. Whaley, if her book can be trusted, seemed comfortable speaking in epigrams.         A secluded garden bench, for example, was ''a place to invite your soul for a visit.''         For all her love of gardening, it was hardly her only love or her only talent. She also, its seems, had a way with the stove.         In October, Algonquin is bringing out a second Whaley collaboration with Mr. Baldwin, a book of recipes and family stories, ''Mrs. Whaley Entertains.''         Mrs. Whaley, whose husband died in 1987, is survived by three daughters, Emily Whipple, Anne Le Clercq and Martha Adams, all of Charleston, and seven grandchildren.       
         Ginette Mathiot, who taught French cooking to the French with such succinct authority that her basic book of recipes sold more than five  million copies, died on June 14 at a retirement home in Paris. She was 91 and best known for her 1932 classic, ''I Know How to Cook.''         In a country whose vaunted cuisine has been largely the province of men, the title of that book, Miss Mathiot's first, has a certain ring of defiance, and no wonder.         Born in Paris in an era when women in France had far fewer career choices than they do today, Miss Mathiot, who was chastising the French cooking establishment as a sexist, male-dominated bastion long after opportunities for women improved, chafed at the restrictions from the beginning.         If she couldn't do anything else, at least she could cook, and if anybody doubted her, it wasn't the generations of French homemakers who turned her book into the bible of the French kitchen.         Raised in an austere household headed by her father, a Protestant minister, she was a brilliant student in secondary school, becoming a disciple of Simone Weil, the ascetic philosopher and mystic. But when she expressed an interest in studying medicine, she was persuaded instead to take teaching courses at the Sorbonne and eventually to specialize in the French version of home economics as a more appropriate outlet for a woman than medicine.         She rose to the top of her academic field, becoming an inspector general in the French homemaking academy before French education authorities withdraw recognition of homemaking as an academic discipline.         By her own account Miss Mathiot  garnered a total of seven marriage proposals but her father rejected each of her suitors on religious grounds (none were Protestant) and although Miss Mathiot considered rebelling, in the end, she said, she found she couldn't and bowed to her family's wishes.         After she established a life and career away from her family, the proposals kept coming, but Miss Mathiot continued to reject them, she said, though for reasons of her own.         If it was a father's stern will that forced her to become a home economics teacher, it was another man's inspired whim -- and a bit of luck -- that led her from the backwaters of education to the front burner of French cuisine.         While Miss Mathiot was still studying to be a teacher at the Paris Training School of Homemaking at the beginning of the Depression, Albin Michel, a portly French publisher, decided that a cook book emphasizing nutrition might help his ailing business, not to mention his waistline, by appealing to what he perceived as a broad public fascination with the developments of modern science, including advances in nutritional understanding.         When leading authorities on French cuisine turned him down, Mr. Michel proposed the project to the head of a local college's science department, who also turned him down but set off a chain of recommendations that finally led Mr. Michel to the 23-year-old Miss Mathiot, who said yes.         Her book, which included 2,000 recipes covering the canon of French cuisine from lobster bisque to crepe suzette, was an immediate sensation and paved the way for sequels, among them books on bread, pastry and even camping-trips cooking.         In addition to emphasizing nutrition, Miss Mathiot's books appealed to family cooks because they showed how to keep food costs down while remaining true to the spirit of French cooking.         Like ''The Joy of Cooking'' in the United States, ''I Know How to Cook'' and other Mathiot books served as primers for novice cooks, leading readers from the basics of food preparation through simple recipes to more elaborate concoctions.         A woman who presided over what she saw as a kitchen with millions of stoves, Miss Mathiot, who leaves no immediate survivors, never took anything for granted.         Anyone following a cake recipe, for example, might think the end had been reached with the instruction to remove the cake from the oven, but Miss Mathiot, mindful of the distractions of a triumphant moment, would have one more instruction: turn off the oven.       
         Catherine Kennedy, who after a  long struggle established one of the nation's first nursing centers for AIDS patients, died on Tuesday at her home in New Haven. She was 51.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, family members said.         Not long after moving to New Haven with her family in 1983, Mrs. Kennedy became aware of the lack of nursing centers and services for people with AIDS. Many were turned away by nursing homes. Some were being kept, at enormous expense, at hospitals essentially unequipped to treat them. Others were homeless.         She resolved to open a nursing center for AIDS patients but constantly encountered obstacles. She waged an eight-year struggle against  financial and political obstacles to establish the home. Her experiences, which became a case study for the Harvard Business School, exemplified how someone involved in social entrepreneurship could overcome  great odds.         After two years of research and attempts to raise money, she received a $60,000 grant from the Merck Family Fund. When she sought help from the State Legislature, she encountered indifference and fear of AIDS among the public, as well as hostility from legislators more interested in cutting health-care funds than increasing them.         But she gained the help of Lucie McKinney, the widow of Representative Stewart McKinney, who had died of AIDS, to plead her case with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.         The Governor was persuaded and,  with others, gained passage of a bill to provide special funding for her project that included daily patient costs that were substantially less than full hospitalization and $3 million to renovate an old factory in New Haven.         In 1995, the home opened in the reconverted factory as Leeway Inc.; Mrs. Kennedy ran it until last fall,  when she was forced to resign because of her illness. In that time about 150 patients have been treated.         Catherine Urwin Kennedy was born on Feb. 12, 1947 in Wallsend, England. She received a bachelor of arts in economics and a master's in economic history from the University of East Anglia in England, where she later taught. She also earned a master's degree at Yale's school of management.         She married Paul Kennedy, the author and Yale historian, in 1967.  Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, James and Matthew, of New Haven, and John, of New York, and two brothers and two sisters, all of England.         It was through her affiliation with  Yale that she was able to apply for her patients' participation in the university's experimental research in  AIDS medication and treatment.         Mrs. Kennedy's original goal was to build a home to shelter and care for dying patients. But today, Leeway staff members said, nearly half  of the patients can be sent home with reasonable chances of survival.  Among them was Fred Tyson, who is going back to work as a casting director in Hollywood.         ''She got us involved,'' he said of Catherine Kennedy. ''And I truly believe I would not be alive if it weren't for her.''       
         Helen Carter, a singer and musician who was part of the Carter family dynasty of country-music entertainers, died on Tuesday at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tenn. She was 70 and lived in Dickson, Tenn.         She had been hospitalized for gastrointestinal problems that began over a year ago, said Kelly Hancock of House of Cash, the business office of Johnny Cash, Mrs. Carter's brother-in-law, and of her sister June Carter Cash.         The original Carter Family band, which helped kick-start the country-music record industry in 1927, was begun by A. P. Carter, a railroad worker and farmer from Maces Springs, Va.; his wife, Sara, and Sara's cousin, Maybelle. The band grew with the occasional addition of Maybelle's children, including Helen.         The family band lasted from 1927 to 1943, and it was of inestimable importance to American music.         It disseminated traditional songs, established a widely imitated small-group sound and built a set of templates that country, bluegrass and folk musicians would draw upon -- the mountain hymn, the love ballad, the cowboy tune and so on.         In 1943 Sara quit singing for good, and Maybelle started a new band, Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, with her daughters as permanent members.         Helen was 12 when she was introduced to the world over the airwaves of XET in Monterrey, Mexico, and in her teen-age years became the most dependable musician of her mother's band, playing accordion, guitar and autoharp.         It was a successful band, featured on ''The Old Dominion Barn Dance,'' a radio show based in Richmond, Va., in 1946; later it moved to the ''Tennessee Barn Dance,'' on Knoxville's WNOX. In 1950 the band joined the Grand Ole Opry on WSM in Nashville, and did some recording as a trio for Columbia records.         Helen Carter was a songwriter as well, writing ''Poor Old Heartsick Me,'' a hit for the singer Margie Bowes in 1959.         In the 1960's and 70's, she often appeared on radio and television not as a member of a working group but simply as a member of the famous clan. For example, she appeared on television with her sister June and  Mr. Cash.         In addition to her sister June, of Hendersonville, Va., she is survived by her husband, Glenn Jones of Dickson, Tenn.; another sister, Anita Carter of Goodlettsville, Tenn.; three sons, Glenn Daniel, David Lawrence, and Kevin Carter Jones, all of Dickson, and six grandchildren.       
         Shirley Polykoff, the pioneering advertising woman who came up with a single double-entendre that changed the face, or rather turned the heads, of American society, died on Thursday at her home on Park Avenue. She was 90 and the author of the ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' slogan, which unleashed American women to choose the color of their hair.         In an era when hair color is no longer a fiat of nature but a routine fashion choice, it is easy to forget that as recently as the mid-1950's hair coloring was such an exotic exception to a cultural norm that only 7 percent of American women dared dye their hair, mainly actresses, models and other fast women.         Then in 1956 Miss Polykoff invented the ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' campaign for a tiny Bristol-Myers division known as Clairol. Almost overnight, the slogan became a national catch phrase, and dyed hair (although never thereafter, she made sure, known that way) went from declasse to de rigueur.         Attracted by the slogan and its reassuring tag line, ''Hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure,'' within a decade nearly half of all American women were regularly coloring their hair, and sales of dyes, tints and rinses had soared from $25 million to $200 million a year, with Clairol accounting for more than half the total (as it does today with industry sales of more than $1 billion).         Once the lone female copywriter at the giant Foote, Cone & Belding advertising agency, Miss Polykoff became the agency's lone female executive vice president, the toast of Madison Avenue and the 1967 Advertising Woman of the Year.         For the Brooklyn-born middle daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants, especially one whose mother wanted her to be a boy, the triumph was hardly a fluke. From the time she was 11 and made ''$3 and change'' for 12 hours' work selling coats in a Brooklyn department store, Miss Polykoff had relished proving herself in the traditional masculine role of breadwinner.         By the time she arrived at Foote, Cone & Belding in time to take over the new Clairol account in 1955, Miss Polykoff, who had written her first advertising copy as a teen-age secretary at Harper's Bazaar, had long since established herself as a star in retail advertising, first for a series of department and variety stores, including Bamberger's and Kresge in Newark, then for New York agencies with retail accounts.         As one of the few women in a male-dominated industry selling almost exclusively to women, the traditional household purchasing agents, Miss Polykoff had an advantage over her sometimes obtuse colleagues, particularly those who told her the proposed ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' campaign was too suggestive.         In her 1975 book, ''Does She . . . or Doesn't She? And How She Did It,'' Miss Polykoff recalled that when similarly obtuse executives at Life magazine turned down a 10-page Clairol layout because of the double-entendre, she challenged them to poll the women in the magazine office.         When the dirty-minded executives could not find a single woman who thought the line had any smutty connotation, Miss Polykoff was not surprised. She had realized all along that well brought-up women of the 1950's, the Clairol target audience, would never admit, as she put it, ''that a nice girl ever got an off-color meaning about anything.'' The ad ran, and, as she recalled, ''everybody got rich.''         To some latter-day feminists, Miss Polykoff was somewhat perplexing, on the one hand an obvious pioneering role model for professional women, on the other a woman whose success, which included such campaigns as ''Is It True Blondes Have More Fun?'' and ''If I've Only One Life to Live, Let Me Live It as a Blonde,'' depended on catering to women's vanity as sex objects.         Miss Polykoff, who frankly used her femininity to charm men and who chided modern businesswomen who try to ape men, did not apologize. For all her ambition and outsized success as a woman, Miss Polykoff was cut from a pre-feminist mold, never forgetting, as she often put it, that she was ''a girl first and an advertising woman second.''         Growing up as the awkward middle daughter between two raven-haired beauties, Miss Polykoff, who saw her blond hair as her only physical distinction (at least until she began to develop what she called her ''sexy curves''), was so distraught when her hair began to darken as a teen-ager that she began having a local hairdresser lighten it, just to make the back match the front. That fiction sufficed until her future mother-in-law secretly asked her son the Yiddish foreshadowing of ''Does she  . . . or doesn't she?''         Miss Polykoff also unabashedly put husband and family above her career, going so far as to hold her Foote, Cone salary to $25,000 so as not to earn more than her lawyer husband, George P. Halperin. After he died in 1961, the agency doubled her salary twice in less than a decade, and when she retired in 1973 to open an agency under her own name she had been Foote, Cone's highest paid salaried employee for many years.         She is survived by two daughters, Laurie Zucker of Athens, Ohio, and Alix Nelson Frick of Manhattan, the president of Franklin Spier Advertising; a sister, Lillian Ovberg of Glen Cove, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  June 15, 1998, Monday  An obituary last Monday about Shirley Polykoff, the advertising woman who devised the slogan ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' in 1956 to advertise hair coloring products, referred incorrectly to the ownership of the advertiser, Clairol. The company was independent at the time. It was acquired in 1959 by the Bristol-Myers Company, now Bristol-Myers Squibb.       
         Judith F. Albert, a toy designer whose credits include the redesign of the Cabbage Patch doll for the mass market as well as other commercially successful dolls, died July 20 from breast cancer at her home in Mill Neck, N.Y. She was 59 years old.         Her vinyl recast of the formerly all-cloth Cabbage Patch doll in the early 1980's for the toy company Coleco Industries set off a frenzy among parents to obtain the dolls for their children or, perhaps, for themselves. Mrs. Albert had devised a way to manufacture the dolls with variety in eye color, facial features and clothes, so that each one looked unique. Like the originals, they also came with birth certificates, suggesting additional reality.         ''People were beating each other up in the store aisles, trying to get one,'' recalled Christopher Byrne, editor of Playthings Market Watch, a toy-industry newsletter. ''There were stories about people flying to Europe to buy them.''         Mrs. Albert, a native of Rockville Centre, N.Y., graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan and joined the Ideal Toy Company, then based in Queens, in 1960. She remained there for more than 20 years, said her husband, Arthur, whom she met when he joined the company in 1963.         Together -- she was the designer, he was the marketer -- they worked on a series of dolls, including Betsy-Wetsy, Tiny Tears, Tiffany Taylor and Chrissie, a doll heralded in television commercials for her ''beautiful hair that grows, and grows, right down to her toes.''         Chrissie, Mr. Albert said, was inspired by a television show he and his wife were watching one night about Rapunzel. ''The hair gave us the idea,'' he said. Chrissie, whose hair could be rewound with a knob attached to her torso, inspired a line of other dolls, including Velvet, who had purple eyes, Mr. Albert said.         By 1981, the couple had left Ideal because they did not want to follow the company when it relocated to New Jersey. They established their own company, called Alberts Design, and continued working on dolls and other toys. Among their successful projects was the Puffalumps series of dolls made by Fisher-Price Inc. -- now part of Mattel Inc. -- one of the first toys to be made of the synthetic fabric used in parachutes, and, more recently, the company came out with Singing Bouncy Baby, which sings when bounced on a child's knee, and Happy Hugs, which has a ''hug-o-meter'' that measures how hard a child squeezes it.         Thin, exuberant and always meticulously dressed, Mrs. Albert was a fixture at the annual Toy Fair in Manhattan for many years, where she now and then dressed in clothes matching whatever Tiffany Taylor, a Barbie-type doll made by Ideal, was wearing that season. In her spare time, she painted, sketched, raised prize-winning dahlias and tended a poolful of ornamental goldfish called koi on the grounds of the house she and her husband designed and built together in 1976.         Her instinct for what would make a doll appeal to children appeared to be innate. Not only would she design a doll, but she would also design the showroom for the manufacturer, said Maurene Souza, a former executive at Hasbro Inc. who worked with Mrs. Albert over the years.         ''She always understood the connection the child makes with the toy,'' Mr. Byrne said. ''Toys that have long-term value really aren't complete without the child.''         In addition to her husband, of Mill Neck, Mrs. Albert is survived by her mother, Florence Carman of Franklin Square, N.Y.; a stepson, Ross M. Albert of East Norwich, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Ronda Kornfeld of Greensboro, N.C., and four stepgrandchildren.       
         Lillian Hoban, who illustrated or wrote more than 100 children's books, including those featuring a badger named Frances and a chimpanzee named Arthur, died on July 17 at New York and Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan and in Wilton, Conn.         The cause was heart failure, said her principal publisher, HarperCollins Children's Books.         Ms. Hoban's best-known works explored the trials and tribulations of early childhood. She first established herself as an illustrator in the 1960's, providing the drawings for the ''Frances'' series written by her husband, Russell Hoban, a prolific author of children's books. She illustrated his ''Baby Sister for Frances'' (1964) and drew the pictures for five more books in that series about Frances and her family.         After the couple divorced in 1975, she began writing and illustrating an ''I Can Read Books'' series about Arthur and his little sister, Violet. An 11th title, ''Arthur's Birthday Party,'' is due out early next year.         Born in Philadelphia, Lillian Aberman Hoban attended the Philadelphia Museum School of Art, studied dance with Martha Graham and taught modern dance in New York and Connecticut. She also danced on television during the 1950's.         She taught herself to draw still lifes, using crayons and pastels, and started writing stories after she had her own children, basing her tales on their everyday adventures.         Ms. Hoban is survived by three daughters, Phoebe, and Julia, both  of Manhattan, and Esme, of Wilton; a son, Brom, of Austin, Tex.; a sister, Esther Man of Los Angeles, and six grandchildren.         Ms. Hoban was active in civic affairs in Wilton, particularly at the Wilton Library.         She also played a prominent role in the National Arts Club's creative writing program for public-school children, hoping to whet their taste for reading and writing.         ''When I am writing, I like writing best, and when I am drawing, I like drawing best,'' she once said. ''But probably what I like better than anything is just messing around with color.''       
         Dorothy West, ''the Kid'' of the  Harlem Renaissance circle of writers and artists in the 1920's who was rediscovered seven decades later when her novel ''The Wedding'' was published and became a best-seller,  died on Sunday night at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard.         Miss West, who began writing stories at age 7 in her family's elegant four-story house in Boston, was not yet 20 in 1926 when her short  story ''The Typewriter'' won a prize from the Urban League's Opportunity magazine. Encouraged, she  moved to Harlem and joined the poets, novelists, musicians and other artists forging a cultural renaissance there. Long before her death, she was frequently described as the last surviving member of that group.         ''We thought we were going to be the greatest writers in the world,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. 'We were all young and we fell in love with each other. We all had the same ambitions: writers and painters and so forth. We were free. . . .We had an innocence that nobody can have now.''         Langston Hughes gave Miss West the nickname ''the Kid'' and took her to Russia in 1932. She asked him to marry her but he declined. Soon she received a proposal from Countee Cullen, the poet who received one of the first Guggenheim Fellowships given to an African-American. She turned him down. She shared an apartment with Zora Neale Hurston, the writer and folklorist, and when guests came to the loft of Wallace Thurman, the novelist and editor, she was always there, sitting on the floor.  She had a bit part in the original stage production of ''Porgy and Bess.'' Claude McKay, already established as a poet and novelist, scolded her for not writing more.         ''We were a beautiful, young group,'' she told a Boston Globe interviewer in 1989. 'We drank too much, though. We drank too much.''         Miss West's first novel, ''The Living Is Easy,'' was not published until  1948, when the Harlem Renaissance had long faded. Her second, ''The  Wedding,'' about the aspirations and anxieties of black people living on Martha's Vineyard, appeared in 1995. Both were written at her family's former vacation home on the  Vineyard, where she had lived year-round since 1947 and was a columnist for The Vineyard Gazette.         At her celebrity-studded 90th birthday party on the island in 1997, which drew hundreds of well-wishers, she was called ''a national treasure'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton.         Miss West's stories and novels used brisk narratives, an eye for detail and wit to explore the aspirations of well-to-do blacks and the interplay of race, class and intraracial tensions in America. Her work was not overtly political, tending to more lyrical depictions of vanity, longing, love and misunderstanding.         ''Color is important, but class is more important,'' Miss West often said in the dozens of interviews she gave after ''The Wedding'' was published by Doubleday and made into a  miniseries by Oprah Winfrey.         Critics praised her storytelling and her pioneering descriptions of  conflict within the black middle class. ''There is an abundance of  psychological and historic richness to her characters,'' Elizabeth Benedict wrote in The Washington Post in 1995, ''and she can be wickedly eloquent about the costs of living in a world where the shadings in the color of one's skin are more important than the bonds between blood relatives.''         Miss West was born on June 2, 1907, in Boston, the only child of Isaac and Rachel West. Her father, born a slave, built a fruit and vegetable business that lifted the family into the slim ranks of Boston's black upper middle class. Her mother, a generation younger, ''spirited, fearless, sassy and smart,'' brought many of her 18 siblings and their families to live with them.         Family members ''ranged in color from the blond child to me,'' Miss  West wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' a collection of short stories and essays published in 1995. ''We were always stared at. . . . My mother prepared us. As she marched us down our front stairs, she would say what our smiles were on tiptoe to hear, 'Come on, children, let's go out and  drive the white folks crazy.'         ''She said it without rancor, and she said it in that outrageous way to  make us laugh. She was easing our entry into a world that outranked us  and outnumbered us. If she could not help us see ourselves with the humor,  however wry, that gives the heart its grace, she would never have forgiven  herself for letting our spirits be crushed before we had learned to  sheathe them with pride.''         The sisters and cousins defended  each other against outsiders, but at home squabbles were melodramatic, Miss West said. ''Surrounded by all these different personalities, each one wanting to be first among equals, I knew I wanted to be a writer.  Living with them was like living inside a story.''         Her work was first published when she was 14, in The Boston Post, and she soon became a regular contributor. After graduating from the Girls' Latin School at 16, she attended Boston University and the Columbia University School of Journalism.         In 1932, she and 20 other black Americans including Langston Hughes, were invited to visit the Soviet Union to work on a proposed movie about racism in America. The film was never made, but Miss West remained in the Soviet Union with Hughes for a year, returning to the United States only when she learned of her father's death.         There remains some question about whether she and Hughes were romantically involved, although she proposed to him in a letter in 1933. In a 1995 interview with The Boston Globe, she said that she never particularly wanted to marry -- ''Seemed like the man just became the woman's child'' -- but had wanted a child.  The memory of how she learned she could not was still painful decades later: the white doctor telling her briskly, ''There are already enough black people in the world.''         Miss West had no immediate survivors, although she remained close to many of her cousins.         In 1934, she founded Challenge, a quarterly magazine intended as a showcase for younger black writers and ''to recapture in the mid-30's the literary vitality of the Harlem Renaissance, which had not survived the Depression.'' Her subsequent magazine, New Challenge -- which reflected the belief of its associate editor, Richard Wright, that art is a weapon -- survived only briefly in 1937.         Miss West became a welfare investigator in Harlem (a job that was the source for several short stories)  and joined the Depression-era Federal Writers Project. In 1940, she began contributing two short stories a month at $50 apiece to The New York Daily News, an association she continued until 1960.         In the summer of 1947, she left New York for good, moving to Martha's Vineyard and the two-bedroom cedar-shingled cottage in Oak Bluffs that her father had bought. She lived there the rest of her life, once writing: ''I have lived in various places, but the island is my yearning place.  All my life, wherever I have been, abroad, New York, Boston, anywhere, whenever I yearned for home, I yearned for the island.''         ''The Living Is Easy'' was published the next year. In this semiautobiographical tale, the strong-willed, light-skinned Cleo Judson -- modeled on Miss West's mother -- tries to remake her darker-skinned  daughter, and breaks up her own  marriage to a former slave who had made himself ''the Black Banana King.'' The book satirizes upper-crust black Bostonians.         In the late 1940's, Miss West began writing columns for The Vineyard Gazette.. While caring for ailing relatives in the now-winterized cottage, she was also slowly writing another novel, published as ''The Wedding'' in 1995. (''The Richer, The Poorer,''  gathering 13 essays and 17 stories Miss West wrote between 1926 and 1987, came out later the same year.)         Starting in 1992, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, then a book editor for Doubleday, had visited the cottage once a week in the summers to work on the long-stalled novel with Miss  West. Mrs. Onassis died shortly before its publication, and Miss West dedicated it to her memory, writing,  ''Though there was never such a mismatched pair in appearance, we were perfect partners.''         Set in the black community on Martha's Vineyard during the 1950's, the novel is a gently ironic story of a beautiful, blond, privileged young black woman, Shelby Coles, who is torn about her planned marriage to a white jazz musician. Using flashbacks from the wedding day to many past generations, it delves into interracial and intraracial bigotry. Miss  West's belief in integration and her penchant for romance coalesced in the final line she gave Shelby Coles: ''Color was a false distinction; love  was not.''         Oprah Winfrey used the novel for a two-part miniseries this year. ''It shows a world that most people have rarely seen, a world where black  families are all highly educated, very successful, living in Martha's  Vineyard,'' Miss Winfrey said.         An energetic conversationalist and inveterate storyteller who was less than five feet tall, Miss West kept her distance from the political upheavals of her lifetime. She went to Communist Russia with Hughes and the others, she wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' because ''I liked them.'' In the 1960's and 70's, Miss West was not active in the civil rights movement and found radicals like the Black Panthers discomfiting.         ''I'm a creative writer,'' she said late in life. ''I'm not a black with a  chip on my shoulder.'' Instead, she often said: ''Color is nothing when you know people.''       
         Juanita Kidd Stout, an Oklahoma music teacher turned Philadelphia lawyer who became the first black woman to serve as a judge in Pennsylvania, then spent the better part of 40 years as a judicial scourge of murder, mayhem and bad grammar, died on Friday at a hospital near her home in Philadelphia. She was 79 and throughout a long pioneering legal career had been first and foremost an English teacher.         Friends said the cause of death was leukemia.         It may not say much about Pennsylvania that the first black woman to gain a seat on a state bench was born in Wewoka, Okla., received a bachelor's degree from the University of Iowa and studied law at Indiana University, but it is to the state's credit that once Judge Stout established a practice in Philadelphia in 1954 it did not take the local legal community long to recognize that it had gained a treasure.         Within two years she had been appointed to the District Attorney's office, where she promptly extended her reputation as ''the hardest working lawyer in Philadelphia.'' Getting up at 4 A.M. seven days a week to study law, cases and evidence, she became so well-known for her preparation, and for her successful prosecutions, that it seemed hardly surprising that she would win swift appointment to the bench.         When she did, in 1959, on an interim appointment to the old Philadelphia Municipal Court, she came up for election two months later and won handily, becoming the first black woman in the country to win election to a court of record.         She was later appointed to the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas, where she specialized in homicide cases. In 1988, she received an interim appointment to the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, making her the first black woman in the country to be a judge on a state's highest court, a position she held for a year, until she turned 70, the court's mandatory retirement age, and returned to the bench in Philadelphia.         She dealt firmly with offenders and despised crime, but seemed to reserve her greatest fury for what she perceived as its underlying cause, an almost willful ignorance, especially among defendants who had dropped out of school without learning to read and write.         Slackers could expect no leniency, but if she saw a glimmer of remorse and a spark of resolve to do better, Judge Stout, who had a fine eye for the line between teen-age excess and hard-core crime, could be accommodating. One gang member who was sentenced to time at reform school rather than at a harsher correctional facility, later became her law clerk and went on to establish a large law firm.         In one of her more celebrated cases, while assigned to juvenile court in 1965, within 24 hours after a white sailor from Georgia was severely beaten while trying to defend a 16-year-old white girl from being raped at a subway station by eight black gang members, Judge Stout had tried, convicted and sentenced seven of the thugs to long prison terms and placed the eighth on probation.         ''Rape today, jail tomorrow,'' she suggested, might be an effective deterrent.         This and several other long sentences she imposed on violent gang members over the next few weeks made Judge Stout such a hero in Philadelphia that when the executive director of the local chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union sent form letters to members of the Philadelphia bar protesting her ''swift justice,'' he received so many angry replies that he sent a second letter, beginning, ''I am sorry that our criticism of Judge Stout has upset you.''         Her tough stance made her a pariah to local gangs, and when her mail included a number of death threats, Judge Stout was predictably outraged. The grammar was atrocious, she said, and the letters were riddled with misspellings.         Indeed, she gave so many impassioned lectures on the importance of education that youthful defendants learned to assure her that they attended school regularly, a tactic that might have worked more often if Judge Stout had not learned to check school attendance records.         She routinely sentenced first-time offenders to write long essays, and was such a stickler for proper usage that she blithely corrected her fellow judges' grammar, and woe betide the lawyer who sought to ''appraise'' her of something.         ''I know my value,'' she would snap. ''Now if you want to apprise me, get on with it.''         When lawyers sought leniency for their youthful clients on the ground that they had deprived upbringings, Judge Stout was unmoved. ''We didn't have indoor plumbing until I was 13,'' she once said, rejecting poverty as an excuse for crime.         She might have grown up poor, but her parents were both teachers, and Judge Stout, who credited her mother with instilling her lifelong habit of hard work, learned to read at 3, entered the third grade at 6 and started college at 16, first at a black school in nearby Missouri and later at the University of Iowa before returning to Oklahoma as a music teacher.         For all her later education, she credited her accidental legal career to a high school shorthand course. Seeking work in Washington in World War II, she landed a job at a law firm and was so good at taking legal dictation that she began to study law, first in Washington and later at Indiana University, where she obtained two law degrees while her husband, Charles Otis Stout, was studying for his doctorate. He died in 1988.         When one of the Washington firm's partners, William H. Hastie, was named to the Court of Appeals in Philadelphia in 1950, he hired his former stenographer as administrative assistant, a position she held until she entered private practice a few years later.         Throughout her career Judge Stout lectured widely, invariably stressing the importance of using correct English, especially when she addressed law students.         In recent years, as she was showered with honors, she modestly suggested they were undeserved but she could hardly complain. The citations hailing her myriad accomplishments were letter perfect.       
         Sybil Harrington, a philanthropist from Amarillo, Tex., who besides supporting medical, education and arts charities was the largest individual donor to the Metropolitan Opera in the company's history, died on Thursday in Phoenix, where she kept a winter home. She was 89.         Grand opera was her passion, Mrs. Harrington once told an interviewer from Town and Country magazine. ''It's all there -- beautiful sets, great costumes, great music,'' she said. ''What more could you want?''         And Mrs. Harrington liked her grand opera grand. Other patrons could back productions of Berg's ''Wozzeck'' and Britten's ''Peter Grimes.'' Her tastes went to Verdi, Puccini, Wagner and Mozart. She made possible some of the Met's most lavish and popular productions, like Franco Zeffirelli's ''Boheme,'' ''Tosca'' and ''Turandot'' and Otto Schenk's ''Meistersinger.'' She financed 16 new productions in total, most recently the Elijah Moshinsky production of Verdi's ''Otello'' introduced in the 1993-94 season. She also supported 13 ''Metropolitan Opera Presents'' television broadcasts, and provided funding for the company's computerized lighting board.         In 1980, Mrs. Harrington made a  gift of $20 million to the Metropolitan Opera endowment fund campaign. In acknowledgement of her extraordinary generosity, the company named the house's auditorium after her.  Marilyn Shapiro, the executive director for external affairs at the Met, estimated that Mrs. Harrington's donations to the Met totaled more than  $30 million.         As a director of the foundation she formed with her husband, Donald D. Harrington, a Texas oil man, Mrs. Harrington also contributed large sums to dozens of diverse charities and organizations, including the Deafness Research Foundation in New York and the Harrington Arthritis Research Center in Phoenix. She was especially attentive to the needs of the Texas Panhandle, providing money for everything from outdoor lights for softball fields in small towns like Gruver to a cancer treatment center outside Amarillo.         Mrs. Harrington was a fierce defender of private philanthropy over government support. ''We've got to have that free enterprise,'' she once said. ''It's important in charitable institutions as well as in business. Art has to have freedom.''         Mrs. Harrington was born Sybil Buckingham in Amarillo in 1908, the granddaughter of some of the first settlers in the remote region. As a child, she liked to fish and shoot, but she especially loved music and dance. She studied piano and organ, and ordered ballet shoes from a catalogue, persuading her mother to take her to Fort Worth for dance classes. Later, she loved listening to the first radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, which fired her love for the art form and the company.         A petite woman with a wry smile and quick wit, she married Mr. Harrington in 1935. They bought a 15,000-square-foot home in Amarillo built in 1914 by a cattle baron who, Mrs. Harrington often recalled, had had the grand Ionic columns that supported the portico hauled to Amarillo by mule train.         The couple's philanthropy began with some scholarships to Texas Tech University in Lubbock, and later with a ranch they bought and turned into the Don Harrington Boy Scout Camp. They established their foundation in 1961.         In 1974, Mrs. Harrington suffered two blows, the deaths of both her husband and, a few months later, their only child, Sally Harrington Goldwater, the wife of Robert Goldwater, the younger brother of Senator Barry Goldwater. Taking charge of the foundation was one way she  was able to cope with her loss.         She had been a regular contributor to the Met but had not thought of financing a production until it was suggested to her by friends on the Met's board. Her first gift made possible the production of Verdi's ''Don Carlo'' by John Dexter, introduced in the 1978-79 season. Mrs. Harrington immersed herself in the experience, attending rehearsals, talking with  cast and crew, dispensing advice. When someone suggested that a white horse and some Irish wolfhounds in one scene were distracting, Mrs. Harrington objected, and the animals remained in the cast.         Other productions she was responsible for, still in use by the company, include Puccini's ''Manon Lescaut,'' Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus,'' Wagner's ''Rheingold'' and Mozart's ''Don Giovanni.'' She became a member of the Metropolitan Opera Association in 1968, a director of its managing board in 1970 and advisory director in 1978.         She is to be buried in Amarillo.         Commenting once on her work as a philanthropist, Mrs. Harrington said: ''Giving money away is hard work. But I got a kick out of it. I felt important for once in my life.''       
         Florence Griffith Joyner, the three-time gold medalist at the 1988 Summer Olympics who revolutionized women's sprinting with her searing speed and flamboyant fashion sense, died yesterday at her home in Mission Viejo, Calif. She was 38.         Greg Foster, a former champion hurdler and a family friend, said he had spoken with Griffith Joyner's husband, Al Joyner, and with her sister-in-law, the track star Jackie Joyner-Kersee, and had been told that Griffith Joyner was believed to have suffered a heart seizure.         An autopsy was performed yesterday afternoon, but the results were not immediately reported.         Lieut. Hector Rivera, a spokesman for the Orange County sheriff's department, said a 911 call was received yesterday at 6:30 A.M., Pacific time, from Griffith Joyner's husband indicating that she was unresponsive and not breathing. No evidence of foul play was discovered or was expected, Lieutenant Rivera said.         Foster, who is an executive in the marketing firm in St. Louis owned by Joyner-Kersee and who has extensive contact with the family, said he had been told that ''she never woke up this morning.''         Griffith Joyner had suffered a seizure two years ago during a flight and was hospitalized briefly. The family said little about that incident. Bob Kersee, who was Griffith Joyner's coach and who is married to Jackie Joyner-Kersee, said yesterday that there had been no diagnosis of the 1996 incident. As far as he knew, Foster said, ''She was doing fine.''         A decade after her shattering achievements in track and field, Griffith Joyner's sprint records still stand, and many feel they will carry into the next century.         Known by the abbreviation ''FloJo'' -- even her name was fast -- she set the world record for 100 meters at 10.49 seconds at the 1988 Olympic trials in Indianapolis, then established the mark of 21.34 seconds in winning the 200 meters at the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul, South Korea, where Griffith Joyner also won gold in the 100 meters and the 4x100-meter relay. She also took a silver medal in the 4x400-meter relay.         Not only did Griffith Joyner run considerably faster than any woman before her or since, she displayed a spectacular flashiness in the way she ran, dressing in one-legged spandex bodysuits and wearing six-inch-long, elaborately decorated fingernails. After retiring in 1989, she designed the uniforms of the Indiana Pacers of the National Basketball Association. And she also served as co-chair of the President's Council on Physical Fitness.         ''We were dazzled by her speed, humbled by her talent and captivated by her style,'' President Clinton said yesterday, praising Griffith Joyner's work with disadvantaged children.         Only now are Griffith Joyner's records even being approached. Marion Jones of the United States ran the 100 in 10.65 seconds this month, and the 200 in 21.62. But even with her present dominance, Jones is still tenths of a second away from Griffith Joyner's records in a sport in which personal bests are usually lowered by hundredths of a second at a time.         ''I think she established herself in sport like Babe Ruth,'' said Terry Crawford, who coached the American women's track and field team at the 1988 Summer Games.         To some, however, Griffith Joyner has come more to symbolize Roger Maris than Babe Ruth, and her accomplishments carry both literal and figurative asterisks. Some have questioned the validity of her 100-meter record because of a possibly faulty wind gauge, and others have questioned whether the stunning times she ran were facilitated by performance-enhancing drugs, something she always denied. She never failed a drug test.         She set the world record in the 100 meters on July 16, 1988, on a day of swirling wind in Indianapolis. The mark of 10.49 seconds was astonishing; it broke Evelyn Ashford's 1984 record by 27-hundredths of a second. In the era of electronic timing, the women's 100-meter record had never been lowered by more than 13-hundredths of a second.         That the wind gauge on the track read 0.0, meaning there was no tail wind or head wind, struck many as illogical, considering that the wind gauge on the nearby triple jump runway showed a reading well above the allowable aiding wind of 4.47 miles an hour. The statistics manual used by track and field's world governing body now includes an asterisk by Griffith Joyner's time and the remarks, ''probably strongly wind assisted.''         Some in Europe have called for a review of the record, but Craig Masback, the chief executive officer of USA Track and Field, the sport's national governing body, said the matter was closed. He called Griffith Joyner a ''ground breaker'' who set standards of speed and flair ''that track and field is still trying to catch up to.'' Crawford, the 1988 Olympic track coach, said: ''There was no wind; I was right there. The track was brand new. It was hot and humid, ideal conditions.''         Because of the significant lowering of her sprint times and her increased musculature in 1988, Griffith Joyner was subjected to rumors and accusations about the possible use of such performance-enhancing drugs as anabolic steroids and human growth hormone.         The most serious allegation was made in 1989 by Darrell Robinson, a former national 400-meter champion, who said that he had sold human growth hormone to Griffith Joyner in 1988. She vehemently denied the charge, calling Robinson a ''compulsive, crazy, lying lunatic.''         ''I have never taken any drugs,''  Griffith Joyner said at the time. ''I don't believe in them. It's a false accusation.''         Yet, it was one that continued to have Griffith Joyner's achievements judged with some ambivalence by her rivals, including Ashford, the former world record-holder at 100 meters who finished second to Griffith Joyner in the 1988 Summer Olympics.         While praising Griffith Joyner's speed and flair, Ashford said yesterday, ''I think, for Florence, the drug issue will always come up, whether she did it or not.''         Griffith Joyner attributed her improved times to weight training, distance running and increased determination after her 1987 marriage to Al Joyner, who had won the triple jump at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. She was not a one-year wonder, having won a silver medal at 200 meters at the 1984 Summer Games. ''I never had any doubt as to the credibility of her records,''  Crawford said.         Delorez Florence Griffith was born Dec. 21, 1959, in the Watts section of Los Angeles, the seventh of 11 children. Her father was an electrical technician and her mother was a teacher.         Always a fashion maverick, she was once asked to leave a shopping mall for wearing her pet boa constrictor around her neck like a feather boa.         According to David Wallechinsky's ''The Complete Book of the Summer Olympics,'' Griffith Joyner began racing as a 7-year-old, but stopped temporarily in 1979, when she withdrew from California State-Northridge to help support her family. Working as a bank teller, she was later persuaded by Coach Bob Kersee to attend U.C.L.A., from which she received a degree in psychology in 1983 and emerging acclaim as a sprinter. Griffith Joyner went into semiretirement after winning an Olympic silver medal in 1984, working in a bank and as a beautician, but she lost weight and returned to serious training in 1987, preparing for her stunning performances a year later.         In addition to her husband, her survivors include their 7-year-old daughter, Mary.       
         Francelia Butler, a late-blooming academic of such passionate, unorthodox ways that she has been credited with almost single-handedly transforming the study of children's literature from a stepchild of library science into a recognized academic discipline, died last Friday at a nursing home in Windham, Conn. A resident of Mansfield Hollow, Conn., she was 85 and had been a professor at the University of Connecticut.         When they hired her in 1965, it's a safe bet that the men who ran the English department at the University of Connecticut knew that Dr. Butler, a native of Cleveland who grew up in Elyria, Ohio, was a 52-year-old widow who had returned to school after her husband's death, received a doctorate in Renaissance literature from the University of Virginia just two years earlier and spent the intervening years teaching at the University of Tennessee.         It's an even safer bet that her Connecticut superiors did not know that in 1934, as a fresh Oberlin College graduate with a degree in the classics, Dr. Butler had gone to Washington to write a pamphlet for  an education association on ''The Brotherhood of Man.'' And that she had been swiftly dismissed from the project after overriding her boss's directive to go easy on Hitler lest she offend association members who agreed with Hitler's policies.         Or that she had been dismissed from her next job, as publicity director of a segregated Washington hotel, after letting black Oberlin alumni attend a banquet there.         Had they been aware of her record of ad hoc social activism, her superiors might have had second thoughts about relegating Dr. Butler, a small woman with a will of steel, to children's literature, a course so scorned by the Connecticut English faculty that it was known derisively as ''kiddie lit.'' Certainly her superiors would not have been as surprised as they were when Dr. Butler, sensing that the academic disdain for children's literature reflected a disdain both for children and for women as children's traditional caretakers and teachers, proceeded to turn the course into a platform for reform.         The faculty's sneers at her course were understandable. Although children's literature had been taught in American universities since the turn of the century, generally as part of the library science or education curriculums, it was a reflection of the subject's lowly standing that it had no academic association and no academic journal.         Dr. Butler swiftly made up for lost time. Among other things, she established the journal Children's Literature, helped to create the children's literature division of the Modern Language Association and served as a founding director of the Children's Literature Association in 1972.         Along the way Dr. Butler's own course became one of the largest and most popular at the University of Connecticut, in part because she turned it into something resembling a three-ring circus with a string of guest lecturers that included falconers, puppeteers, troubadours, Maurice Sendak, Isaac Bashevis Singer, Bruno Bettelheim, Dr. Benjamin Spock, Big Bird and the Wicked Witch of the West (the actress Margaret Hamilton).         Some of her colleagues predictably complained that the course's success was based more on showmanship than scholarship, but Dr. Butler, many of whose students went on to to teach children's literature at other colleges, was no slacker as a scholar. She turned out reams of  papers, edited anthologies and in 1989 published ''Skipping Around the World,'' a study of international  jump-rope rhymes.         For all the acclaim she won, Dr. Butler chafed at what she saw as Connecticut's indifference or active opposition to her efforts to wrest children's literature from its vocational moorings and place it within the humanities.         When, by her account, her upstart Journal was actually banned from the University of Connecticut bookstore, Dr. Butler found another academic sponsor: Yale University. (Later, when Connecticut seemed to shun the annual Peace Games Festival she established to teach children conflict resolution through games that rewarded cooperation over competition, she moved it to Harvard.)         Although her male colleagues suggested that the university had been more supportive than she claimed, after her retirement in 1992 at the age of 79, Dr. Butler, who typically had led the campaign that overturned Connecticut's mandatory retirement at 70, transferred her journal and her papers to Hollins College in Virginia.         She is survived by her daughter, Ann Wandell of Windham; a brother, Bruce McWilliams of Little Deer Isle, Me; four grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         Fiamma di San Giuliano Ferragamo, a designer who helped develop one of the most famous shoe labels in fashion, died on Monday at her home in Florence. She was 57. She died of cancer, said Ferrucio Ferragamo, her brother and chief executive officer of Salvatore Ferragamo Italia.         For almost 40 years Fiamma Ferragamo was responsible for the design of the famed Ferragamo shoes and leather accessories, helping to build Ferragamo from a custom shoemaker for the elite to a global fashion powerhouse with a network of boutiques in New York, Milan, London and Paris. In 1996 the company had become so robust it was able to scoop up the Emanuel Ungaro company.         Ms. Ferragamo pursued her vigorous activities for her family company in defiance of doctors' prognostications a decade ago after she underwent surgery for breast cancer. ''She went against all the predictions at the beginning,'' Ferruccio Ferragamo said yesterday. ''They thought it was only a question of a few months and she made it 10 years.''         As executive vice president and a board member of the Ferragamo company, Ms. Ferragamo played a central role in the business, attending meetings as recently as two weeks ago with her five siblings and her mother, Wanda, the chairman, said Ferruccio Ferragamo.         Ms. Ferragamo prided herself on the comfort and elegance of the Ferragamo shoe, values she inherited from her father, Salvatore, who founded the firm in 1927.         Ms. Ferragamo's most successful shoe design, a round-toe low-heeled pump with grosgrain ribbon and gold buckle stamped with the family signature, became a badge of executive propriety and country club chic. Even though Ms. Ferragamo designed the Vara -- as she called the model -- in the 1960's, the shoe has never lost its appeal and remains a wardrobe staple for many conservative white-collar women in much the same way the Oxford wingtip is for white-collar men.         Ms. Ferragamo was born in Florence in 1941, the eldest of three boys and two girls. She began working for the company at 16 when her father had already established it as one of the most prestigious names in shoes. At one point it seemed that there was no foot in royal Europe or royal Hollywood that Mr. Ferragamo had not dressed -- from Audrey Hepburn, Elizabeth Taylor, Sophia Loren and Greta Garbo to the Duchess of Windsor, Queen Elena of Italy and, as he pointed out in ''Shoemaker of Dreams,'' his 1957 autobiography, Eva Braun.         Ms. Ferragamo inherited his mantle when she was only 19. When he was dying of cancer, Salvatore Ferragamo left her in charge while he sought treatment in the United States. He died in 1960.         Ms. Ferragamo believed in promotion as well as creation and she spent weeks flying around the United States selling her product in stores.         In 1967 she received the Neiman Marcus Award for Distinguished Service in the Field of Fashion, 20 years after her father was similarly honored.         When she was not designing or plotting acquisitions, Ms. Ferragamo served on the board of the Italian Environmental Fund, which protects historic Italian houses. She loved entertaining in her home and shopping for the home even more. She adored nights at the opera. A regular visitor with her husband, Giuseppe di San Giuliano, to the Salzburg Festival, she would not miss a night of the Maggio Musicale season in Italy directed by Zubin Mehta, a frequent guest in her home.         An ear for music was augmented with a nose for marmalade, as  Ms. Ferragamo developed her own recipe for the orange jam, which is sold by the jar in Japan.         In addition to her husband, her mother and her brother, she is survived by a son, Diego, two daughters, Giulia and Maria, two other brothers, Leonardo and Massimo, a sister, Fulvia Visconti Ferragamo, all of Florence; and another sister, Giovanna Gentile Ferragamo, of Milan. All are officers of the company.         Ms. Ferragamo's successor at the company has not been named, said Ferruccio Ferragamo. A team of designers that reported to her will continue to design the line.         Ms. Ferragamo pursued her passions to the last. On a typical shopping jaunt here in May, she was unstoppable. ''We did Banana Republic, always Saks, Gracious Home was like a candy store to her,'' said Helen O'Hagan, a friend and former Saks executive. ''Here she is -- I'm falling on my face -- straight out of chemo. We went to one of those antique shows at the pier and she would be there in four-inch heels and ahead of the pack.''       
         Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, the grande dame of sex education, died yesterday at the Kendal at Longwood nursing home in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 94 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last decade.         Indefatigable and fired by a zeal for sexual responsibility and realism, Dr. Calderone persuaded a recalcitrant American Medical Association to let doctors dispense birth control as a matter of course to their patients, and she set in motion the means of educating schoolchildren about human sexuality.         Dr. Calderone did more than any other individual to convince both the medical profession and the public that human sexuality goes far beyond the sex act. She heralded it as a multifaceted and vital part of a healthy life that should not be hidden under a shroud of secrecy or limited to erotic expression.         One of her favorite challenges to young audiences she addressed was to ask for a four-letter word ending in ''k'' that meant sexual intercourse. Over a chorus of titters, she would give her answer: ''talk.'' Then she would explain, ''We never talk to each other as nonsexual people.''         Dr. Calderone, the daughter of the photographer Edward Steichen, was a woman of many talents and diverse interests who did not find her true calling until midlife. Following graduation from Vassar College, where she majored in chemistry, she decided to go on the stage, but abandoned her acting career when she realized she could never be as good as Katherine Cornell.         At the age of 30, after a failed marriage to a fellow actor, W. Lon Martin, and the birth of two daughters, Nell and Linda, she decided to go to medical school.         She received an M.D. degree in 1939 from the University of Rochester and a master's degree in public health in 1942 from the Columbia University School of Public Health. While at Columbia she met Dr. Frank Calderone, then a district health officer on the Lower East Side who would soon become deputy commissioner of health for New York City and her second husband. The couple was married in 1941.         Dr. Calderone served for some years as a school physician in Great Neck, L.I. In 1953 she became medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, where she carried forward Margaret Sanger's mission for family planning.         In 1964 Dr. Calderone realized one of her crowning goals: she convinced the trustees of the American Medical Association that the nation's leading organization of physicians should disseminate information on reproduction and birth control and endorse the prescription of birth control measures to all patients who needed them. The trustees' proposal was adopted, helping to move birth control into the mainstream of American medicine.         Three years earlier, as a representative of family planning, she took part in the first American Conference on Church and Family run by the National Council of Churches. Attended by sociologists, religious leaders, educators and public health professionals, the conference highlighted the suffering of thousands of people because of ignorance about frigidity, impotence, homosexuality and contraception.         With five colleagues at the conference, Dr. Calderone set up an informal committee to study human sexuality. Out of that committee grew Dr. Calderone's signature achievement, the co-founding of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States in 1964. Dr. Calderone then resigned from Planned Parenthood to turn her attention from reproductive biology to education in human sexuality.         Better known by its acronym Siecus, the council was created to help teachers, therapists and other professionals establish human sexuality as an integral part of health and health education. Under her guidance, Siecus became the moving force for education about human sexuality in the schools as well as in the community. The organization publishes ''Guidelines for Sexuality Education: Kindergarten through 12th Grade'' and helps schools around the country set up comprehensive sex education programs.         As the president of Siecus, Dr. Calderone stood out in the 1960's as an innovator, one of a handful of educators, scientists and philosophers who were beginning to address the big topics of human existence like death and sexuality. She was an unstinting advocate for the acceptance of masturbation as a wholesome, normal and almost universal practice for people of all ages.         Dr. Calderone was far more than a female doctor championing a cause. Her theatrical training, coupled with her carriage, poise and authoritative voice, helped her to get her message across that children are born sexual beings and remain so until they die and that people of all ages need and deserve a proper sexual education.         Dr. Calderone believed sex education in the schools should start in kindergarten, and under her direction Siecus helped to set up sex education programs in thousands of schools throughout the country. After stepping down from the presidency, she joined New York University as an adjunct professor in its program on human sexuality. She was active professionally until age 80.         Almost from birth, Mary Steichen was a natural leader: optimistic, determined, resilient and forthright, who from early childhood knew how to speak her mind. At age 6, for example, she criticized the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, a family friend, for creating ''L'Oiseau d'Or'' with a horizontal head, a position that she said would make it impossible for the bird to sing. Brancusi's later bird sculptures had more uplifted heads.         Her imposing appearance combined with her strong personality helped her advance her causes and also to defend them against attacks by groups like the Christian Crusade, the John Birch Society and Moral Majority, who contended that her promotion of sex education in schools was encouraging a premature and unhealthy participation in sexual experience and usurping the role of parents in guiding their children's lives. Her reply was that if parents were doing their job properly there would be no need for school-based sex education.         A devout Quaker and a Republican, she was once labeled by the John Birch Society as an ''aging sexual libertine.'' She reminded her critics that modern children were in desperate need of sex education because they were sexually vulnerable: ''devoid of chaperones, supervision, rules and close family relations and subject to onslaughts of commercial sexual exploitation.''         But recognizing that a child's sexual attitudes are often shaped before school age, Dr. Calderone also focused on educating parents. Through Siecus she established Parent Learning Centers to teach adults about their own sexuality as well as their children's.         In 1981 she and Eric Johnson wrote a widely praised book, ''The Family Book About Sexuality,'' which was published in five languages. The following year, she and James W. Ramey were the co-authors of ''Talking With Your Child About Sex,'' published in four languages.         Dr. Calderone also contributed to many professional publications and served as editor of texts on abortion and family planning.         Though Dr. Calderone saw serendipity as a major architect of her success, she did not always lead a charmed life. She grew up as the daughter of a working artist. Her mother, Clara, was considered cold, and their relationship adversarial.         When her parents divorced, Mary, then 10, chose to live with her father. Not until nearly seven decades after the divorce was she able to bury the emotional hatchet that had estranged her from her mother.         Dr. Calderone's own experiences as a mother were also difficult. Her 8-year-old daughter, Nell, died of pneumonia, plunging her into a debilitating depression.         Her marriage to Dr. Calderone, who later became chief administrative officer of the World Health Organization, produced two more daughters, Dr. Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist, and Dr. Maria Calderone, a veterinarian in Galena, Ohio, born almost 20 years after her oldest daughter, Linda Hodes, a psychotherapist in Albuquerque, N.M.         The Calderones separated in 1979 but never divorced. Dr. Frank Calderone died in 1987.         In addition to her daughters, Mary Calderone is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 10, 1998, Tuesday  An obituary on Oct. 25 about Dr. Mary S. Calderone, who battled political and religious groups to take sex education to schools, misstated her political affiliation. She was a Democrat, not a Republican. The list of survivors also misidentified the public health degree held by a daughter, Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist. It is a master's, not a doctorate.       
         Jean Dalrymple, who abandoned a nascent acting career to become a successful publicist, then an even more successful manager of concert artists and finally a dynamic producer of musicals and plays for City Center and other stages, died on Sunday at her Manhattan home, across the street from City Center. She was 96.         Miss Dalrymple's stature in the New York theater world was enhanced by her uncanny ability to lure just the right actor for a particular role at a price that City Center, with its limited budget, could afford. Her skillful productions nourished and entertained audiences there from the 1940's through the 60's.         Among the center's offerings during her tenure as director of its theater and light-opera companies were plays by Shakespeare and Shaw, Sartre and Tennessee Williams, with actors like Jose Ferrer, Charles Boyer, Franchot Tone, Jessica Tandy and Hume Cronyn, Charlton Heston, Helen Hayes and Tallulah Bankhead. She also revived musicals by Cole Porter, the Gershwins, Frank Loesser, Rodgers and Hart, and Rodgers and Hammerstein.         The productions were quite polished. Indeed, after an opening of one Rodgers and Hammerstein revival, Miss Dalrymple received a floral tribute from the composers with a note that said, ''We wish last night had been the Broadway opening.''         In her day, Miss Dalrymple was one of a handful of formidable female producers; the others included Cheryl Crawford and Irene Selznick. She was as tough as they were, a woman in perpetual motion, but she did not seem that way.         ''Jean always had a kind of solid serenity about her,'' said Robert Whitehead, the producer. ''She had a great determination to get things done, but she was always very feminine, very pretty. She was an extraordinary person.''         Franchot Tone, an actor whose work Miss Dalrymple always admired, thought of her as ''the tenderest little lady.'' But a writer from The Cleveland Plain Dealer described as her as ''as fragile as a Fragonard painting but hep and with a sense of timing like a Garand rifle.''         In addition to luring actors, she was also able to persuade producers to give the City Center sets and costumes when their plays and musicals ended their runs. Thus, her revival of ''My Fair Lady'' featured the original costumes.         Creating a 'Temple' For Performing Arts         City Center, for which Miss Dalrymple worked so long and hard, was established on West 55th Street in 1943 by Mayor Fiorello La Guardia and City Council President Newbold Morris, who wanted it to be a ''temple for the performing arts,'' offering productions for a top price of $2.         Miss Dalrymple was there at the very beginning. Her success with their dream was such that when the center turned 50 in 1993 and called itself ''a glorious home for dance, music, opera and dozens of extraordinary musicals and plays,'' there were many who thought the phrase an understatement of what Miss Dalrymple had accomplished.         Initially serving as volunteer director of public relations and as a member of its board, Miss Dalrymple remained at the middle of City Center's publicity apparatus even after she started producing and directing. At the same time, she served as personal manager to performing artists like Leopold Stokowski, Mary Martin, Jose Iturbi, Andre Kostalanetz, Nathan Milstein and Lily Pons.         Jean Dalrymple was born on Sept. 2, 1902, in Morristown, N.J., to George and Elizabeth Collins Dalrymple. There was no shortage of money in her family; her grandfather, an officer in the Civil War, had founded a coal and lumber business that sustained the family very well.         When she was 9, she finished a short story, ''The Spinning Top,'' and sold it to a Newark newspaper for $1. Encouraged by this success, she wrote more stories for a Philadelphia paper, receiving $5 for each one. But even in those days, she thought of writing as secondary to her goal of becoming a stage director.         After completing her secondary education, Miss Dalrymple moved to New York, studied secretarial skills at a business school and got a stenographer's job on Wall Street when she was only 16. She even made a respectable sum in the market before the crash of 1929. The crash propelled her out of Wall Street and into vaudeville. She created an act with her beau Dan Jarrett and worked with James Cagney and Cary Grant on the Keith-Orpheum circuit.         During this period, she tried her hand at playwriting; ''Salt Water,'' written with Mr. Jarrett, was produced by John Golden. She was hired by Golden as an understudy, casting director, play doctor and press agent, and her skill in handling the press so impressed him that he encouraged her to work at it full time.         It also impressed Ward Morehouse, the drama critic for The New York Sun, so much so that in 1932 he proposed marriage. It was not a successful union, but in the five years they were together, they collaborated on a screenplay, ''It Happened in New York,'' which was made into a movie by Universal Pictures.         Miss Dalrymple was married in 1951 to Maj. Gen. Philip de Witt Ginder, who died in 1968. No immediate family members survive. The funeral will be held on Thursday at 1:30 P.M. at the West Point chapel.         Miss Dalrymple was one of the founding members of the American Theater Wing, the theater service organization. In 1939 she was its first publicity volunteer, and during World War II, she trained speakers who sold war bonds during the time of the Stage Door Canteen.         By 1940, Miss Dalrymple was working as an independent press agent, much sought after because of her contacts. Among the Broadway plays for which she handled the publicity were ''Mr. and Mrs. North'' (1941), ''One Touch of Venus'' (1943)  and ''Anna Lucasta'' (1944).         In 1945, she turned to producing. Her first effort, a collaboration with Marc Connelly, was ''Hope for the Best,'' a comedy by William McCleery, who had been Sunday editor of the newspaper PM. She did not leave the publicity business but pursued more producing ventures, among them ''Brighten the Corner'' (1945) and ''Burlesque'' (1946).         Meanwhile, she began to devote more of her energy to developing productions for the newly formed City Center, which was started in the old Mecca Temple that had been built years before by the Shriners. It had been taken over by the city for nonpayment of taxes and it stood idle, except for its occasional use as the site for Civil Service examinations.         Early productions included Thornton Wilder's ''Our Town,'' mostly because it required no scenery and was inexpensive to produce, and ''Porgy and Bess,'' which the center snared as it was completing a national tour.         Miss Dalrymple was especially proud of her production of ''Porgy.'' ''I had an overwhelming desire to restore it to its original form and present it exactly as as George Gershwin and DuBose Heyward had created it, as an opera for the Metropolitan,'' she once recalled.         One Misstep, Angering Sartre         In her 1975 memoir, ''From the Last Row,'' she recalled that Howard Taubman of The New York Times ''loved it'' but that Judith Crist of The New York Herald Tribune said she preferred the original Broadway version. ''I wrote her,'' Miss Dalrymple said, ''and told her she had a tin ear.'' She was pleased that this production of ''Porgy'' sold out and that ''Miss Crist never held my impulsive letter against me.''         In 1948, Miss Dalrymple thought she had scored a coup when she succeeded in getting Jean-Paul Sartre's permission to produce his play ''Les Mains Sales'' in an English adaptation by Daniel Taradash called ''Red Gloves.'' She followed this up by inducing Charles Boyer to make it his first Broadway role.         What began as a coup threatened to become a coup de grace; Sartre read Taradash's adaptation after he gave Miss Dalrymple the go-ahead and was filled with loathing for it. He loudly denounced it publicly as ''a vulgar, common melodrama with an anti-Communist bias.'' When the play opened, Brooks Atkinson echoed Sartre's denunciation and wrote in The New York Times that it was a production that ''looked and sounded bogus.'' It quickly closed.         But she scored many triumphs in the years that followed. Word of her organizational abilities spread and in 1951 the State Department asked her to arrange for what the United States would offer at the Berlin Arts Festival that year. In 1958 the State Department called on her again, this time to arrange for the performances sent by the United States to the Brussels World's Fair, including those by Harry Belafonte, William Warfield, Jose Iturbi and the Juilliard String Quartet.         In 1953, she persuaded Jose Ferrer to star in and direct four plays at the City Center during an eight-week season: ''Cyrano de Bergerac,'' ''The Shrike,'' ''Richard III'' and ''Charley's Aunt.'' To help City Center grapple with its tight budget, Mr. Ferrer and all the cast members in these productions worked for the Actors Equity minimum.         Mr. Ferrer called the center ''this happy beehive of the arts,'' and donated $1,000 to the cause. The season was a critical and box-office success. ''They have made the theater seem like a fresh, exciting, varied form of public art,'' Atkinson wrote in The Times.         In 1956 Miss Dalrymple persuaded Orson Welles to appear in ''King Lear'' (he performed in a wheelchair after breaking a leg in rehearsals) and Tallulah Bankhead to play Blanche Dubois in ''A Streetcar Named Desire.'' Both productions earned critical praise.         Among Miss Dalrymple's other warmly received revivals were ''The Beggar's Opera,'' ''Brigadoon'' (with Edward Villela as the villain), ''Pal Joey'' (with Bob Fosse in the title role), ''Guys and Dolls'' (with Walter Matthau as Nathan Detroit) and ''The Pajama Game.''         When her revivals turned a profit, Miss Dalrymple used the money to subsidize City Center's other companies, the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera, both of which moved to Lincoln Center in 1964. Her revivals were doomed in the late 1960's, however, when the city began to experience a series of fiscal crises.         Among Miss Dalrymple's other books were an autobiography, ''September Child'' (1963), ''Careers and Opportunities in the Theater'' (1969), ''Jean Dalrymple's Pinafore Farm Cookbook'' (1971) and ''The Folklore and Facts of Natural Nutrition'' (1973).         As a producer, Miss Dalrymple tended to play down her adroit handling of the press, which is critical in the success of even the most expertly produced play. ''I never went in for theme parties or the crazy events that publicists stage today,'' she said in 1993. ''I simply advertised the facts of the production. At City Center, that was always enough.''
