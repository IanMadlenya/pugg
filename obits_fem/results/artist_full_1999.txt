         Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California artist and conservationist who fought for the survival of sea otters, sea lions, mountain lions and other wild creatures, died on Jan. 21 at Wild Bird, her clifftop home above the Pacific in Big Sur, Calif. She was 85.         The cause was heart failure, reported the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which recently published a paean by her to Mother Nature.         Mrs. Owings, a former member of the California Parks Commission, led campaigns to protect the world's forests and oceans. The National Audubon Society honored her with a medal in 1983 and last year listed her among 100 individuals who had done the most to shape the environmental movement, along with Barry Commoner, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, William O. Douglas, Lady Bird Johnson, Stewart Udall and Morris K. Udall.         A native of Berkeley, Calif., she graduated from Mills College in 1934 and completed graduate studies in art the next year at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University. She had one-woman exhibitions of her stitchery at galleries and folk-art museums but largely set aside her art to work for conservation.         She and her second husband, Nathaniel Alexander Owings, a founding partner of the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, fought to keep the developers away from the wild beauty of Big Sur.         Seasonal residents of Santa Fe, N.M., they also assembled a collection of the art and Pueblo culture of the Southwest, now part of the collection of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.         Mrs. Owings was the founder and first president of Friends of the Sea Otter and won a battle to end the bounty-hunting of mountain lions in her state. As a member of the Point Lobos League she was instrumental in saving the beaches between the Carmel River and Point Lobos State Preserve, near Monterey.         She sat on the council of the Save-the-Redwoods League and the Big Sur Land Trust. She was a past trustee of Defenders of Wildlife, the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation and the Environmental Defense Fund, and a founder of the Rachel Carson Council.         She wrote about her experiences and spent the last months of her life compiling her writings and artwork. The resulting book, ''Voice From the Sea: Reflections on Wildlife and Wilderness'' was published weeks before her death.         Nathaniel Owings, who designed their home, Wild Bird, died in 1984.         Mrs. Owings is survived by a daughter, Wendy M. Benjamin, of Durango, Colo., from her previous marriage to Malcolm Millard, a resident of Carmel, Calif.; three stepdaughters, Natalie O. Prael and Jennifer O. Dewey, both of Santa Fe., and Emily O. Kapozi, of Novato, Calif.; a brother, William Wentworth, of Walnut Creek, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  February 2, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Sunday about Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California conservationist, omitted the name of a surviving stepson. He is Nathaniel O. Owings of Santa Fe, N.M.       
         Frances Godowsky, a prolific painter and sometime singer better known as George and Ira's little sister, Frankie Gershwin, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92 and the last of the Gershwin siblings.         In a family where talent abounded, Mrs. Godowsky and her slightly older brother, Arthur, inherited their share of the Gershwin genes, but when one older brother is one of the century's most acclaimed composers and another is among its most lionized lyricists, it is hard to measure up.         Not that Mrs. Godowsky didn't have her moments. An accomplished dancer who toured at 11 in a children's musical, ''Daintyland,'' she never let George and Ira forget that when they were grateful for $15 paychecks from Tin Pan Alley, she was the family's first big breadwinner -- never mind that most of her $40 weekly salary went to pay expenses.         Born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan on Dec. 26, 1906, 10 years to the day after her oldest brother, Ira, Mrs. Godowsky had a peripatetic childhood as her father, Morris, a man with an eclectic personnel file, repeatedly moved the family to be near his latest job. (Ira once calculated that between 1900 and 1917 the family lived in 28 apartments, 25 in Manhattan and 3 in Brooklyn.)         Although she sang in a couple of Broadway shows in the late 1920's, by the time the family moved into the house on West 103d Street made famous in the 1945 biographical movie, ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' Mrs. Godowsky seemed resigned to tailoring her career to her older brothers'.         Frequently summoned to George's lair on the fifth floor, she was often the first to sing Gershwin songs that would later be Broadway hits, and when George was in rehearsal for ''Lady Be Good,'' brother and sister would try out steps he had learned from the show's star, Fred Astaire.         Although her husky voice was small by stage standards of the day, George, who loved her interpretations of his sometimes complicated music, particularly the way she kept the rhythm going, made her his personal chanteuse, and the two entertained at countless flapper-era parties in New York and elsewhere.         In time, Mrs. Godowsky was glad enough to accept the benefits of being his beloved little sister.         In one episode in early 1928, Mrs. Godowsky, who was dating a boring doctor at the time, begged George to let her tag along on a European trip he and Ira were planning.         By the time she returned six months later, Mrs. Godowsky had so wowed Cole Porter at a party Elsa Maxwell gave in Paris that he designed a show for her at the storied nightclub Les Ambassadeurs, where she sang Gershwin tunes with George as her accompanist.         The limited engagement drew her a flood of professional offers, but George insisted she return with the rest of the party.         By then she had fallen in love with one of George's poker cronies, Leopold Godowsky Jr., the son of the celebrated Austrian pianist.         They married in 1930 and settled in Rochester, N.Y., where Mr. Godowsky helped invent Kodachrome, the acclaimed slide film.         Mrs. Godowsky, who had been her brother George's tryout singer, played a similar role for her husband, posing in bright red beret and bottle-green dress as a photographic test subject.         Soon after George's death in 1937, the couple moved to Westport, Conn.,  where Mrs. Godowsky, who had begun sculpturing in Rochester, hit her own artistic stride. She took up painting and turned out hundreds of well-received oils and acrylics.         The success of her painting helped soften the blow when the movie ''Rhapsody in Blue,'' came out in 1945 and excised her and Arthur from the Gershwin family. Arthur died in 1981.         Although painting remained her main artistic outlet, in her later years Mrs. Godowsky re-emerged as a singer. Her 1975 album, ''Frances Sings for George and Ira,'' won wide acclaim, and after a granddaughter suggested she get vocal training, she began a long-deferred professional career, singing Gershwin tunes at the Lambs Club and elsewhere until two years ago.         Mrs. Godowsky, whose husband and brother Ira both died in 1983, is survived by a son, Leopold 3d, of Manhattan; three daughters, Alexis Gershwin of Beverly Hills, Calif.; Georgia Keidan of Chappaqua, N.Y., and Nadia Natali of Ojai, Calif., and eight grandchildren.         Correction:  January 27, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary last Wednesday about Frances Gershwin Godowsky, an artist and the sister of George Gershwin, misstated the nationality of her father-in-law, the pianist Leopold Godowsky. He was born outside Vilna, in an area that once belonged to Poland but was then part of Russia and is now in Lithuania; he was not Austrian.       
         Dr. Miriam Freund-Rosenthal, a former national president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on Saturday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 92 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Dr. Freund-Rosenthal persuaded the artist Marc Chagall to create the stained glass windows for a synagogue in Jerusalem, endowed Hadassah educational seminars in the United States and Israel and wrote the book 'A Tapestry of Hadassah Memories.'' She and her second husband, Harry Rosenthal, also endowed clinics and parks in Israel through Hadassah.         During her presidency, from 1956 through 1960, a second hospital was built for the Hadassah medical center in Jerusalem, in the Ein Kerem neighborhood. It was dedicated in 1960.         Dr. Freund-Rosenthal, whose doctorate was in history from New York University, was known as Miriam K. Freund when she was Hadassah's president.         With about 300,000 members, Hadassah says it is the United States's largest women's organization, largest Jewish organization and largest Zionist organization.         Before and after Dr. Freund-Rosenthal was Hadassah's president, she held a variety of other posts overseeing the organization's education and youth programs. She was also prominent in other Zionist and Jewish communal organizations.         In a volume of memoirs, ''In My Lifetime'' (1989), she tells of her visit with the violinist Isaac Stern to Chagall in France. The artist agreed to create the design for the stained-glass windows that were to be installed in the synagogue in the Ein Kerem hospital complex, saying, ''I have always looked forward to a call from the Jewish people.'' Known as the Jerusalem windows, they have attracted immense numbers of visitors over the years.         Miriam Kottler Freund-Rosenthal was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Harry Kottler and the former Rebecca Zindler, and lived in Perth Amboy, N.J., and Harlem as a child. She received a bachelor's degree in 1925 from Hunter College and a master's degree and doctorate from N.Y.U. In 1935 she first visited what was then Palestine.         She taught in the New York City public school system for a decade and a half until the early 1940's, and was prominent in fund-raising for the founding of Brandeis University, which opened in 1948.         Her other writings include the books ''Jewish Merchants in Colonial America'' (1939) and ''Jewels for a Crown'' (1963).         In 1927, she married Milton B. Freund, a financier active in Jewish communal and religious affairs, who died in 1968. She married Harry Rosenthal, a businessman in St. Paul in 1974. He died in 1989.         Her survivors include two sons, Dr. Matthew Freund of Miami Beach; and Harry I. Freund of Harrison, N.Y. and Manhattan; 5 grandchildren; 10 great-grandchildren and 2 stepdaughters, Midge Decter of Manhattan, the political writer, and Connie Fields of St. Paul.       
         Indrani, a distinguished dancer who familiarized Americans with several styles of India's classical dance as a performer and teacher, died on Friday in Beekman Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Sukanya Wicks, said.         Indrani was an artist of international repute and often appeared before heads of state in her native India and abroad. But she also became a highly respected figure in the dance world of New York after her debut there in 1960. The hallmark of her dancing, a blend of dramatic vibrancy and technical refinement, carried over to her teaching at American colleges and festivals.         Although she had a home in New Delhi until recently, she spent most of the last two decades in the United States, where she toured extensively. In 1961, Indrani was the first dancer presented on a national tour by the Asia Society. She had been on the faculty of the Juilliard School since 1976.         ''Indrani was an exquisite dancer, a great teacher and a true rasika, in the largest spirit of that word, meaning a lover of the arts,'' Rachel Cooper of the Asia Society said yesterday. Ms. Cooper, associate director of the society's performing arts and public programs, also praised Indrani's role as a producer of concerts in New York by younger Indian dancers. She said the society had planned to give Indrani a lifetime achievement award. ''The event will now be a memorial as well,'' Ms. Cooper said.         Unlike many Indian dancers of her generation, Indrani did not specialize in a single school of classical dance but studied with leading gurus in India to master the contrasting styles of Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam and Orissi.         In the 1950's, Indrani was the first professional dancer to perform Orissi onstage; Orissi, then a neglected dance form, was inspired by temple sculpture in the state of Orissa, in eastern India. Indrani was instrumental in the revival of Orissi, introducing it to audiences in India by touring widely there and doing the same abroad when she performed as a soloist or with her ensemble of musicians and dancers.         In championing rarely seen or forgotten classical dance forms, Indrani followed naturally in the footsteps of her mother, Ragini Devi, an American-born dancer who was internationally known for her leading role in the revival of classical dance in India in the 1930's.         As Esther Sherman in Petoskey, Mich., the future Ragini Devi was already in love with Indian dance when she met Ramlal Bajpai in Minneapolis. After she married Bajpai, an Indian scientist and activist for Indian independence, she traveled to India to study dance in 1930. Their daughter, Indrani, was born that year in Madras. In her book ''Dance Dialects of India,'' Ragini Devi described how she would take the infant Indrani on her own visits to gurus. As a dancer, Indrani was her  ''alter ego,'' Ragini Devi wrote. ''Her dance career is a continuation of mine.''         Ragini Devi, who died in 1982, made her last stage appearance at a memorable concert in 1979 at New York University. She was joined by Sukanya, Indrani's daughter and also a dancer, as well as Indrani. The vivacity of all three generations came into play.         Indrani's playfulness and gaiety at that performance were typical of her vivid personality. In the dramatic Kuchipudi solos, Indrani's quick shifts in characterization were always subtle and deep.         Having started at age 5 in her mother's company, she was steeped in the content of classical dance. As a professional, she began with Bharata Natyam, where she could display the rhythmic complexity of her footwork. But mime within this style and in others allowed her to exhibit her brilliant dramatic gifts.         The Indian Government sponsored Indrani's tours. Her warmth and artistry, as well as the beauty of her costumes and presentations, made her a perfect choice. In 1961 she performed for President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during Nehru's official visit to Washington. Indrani received the Indian Government's national award, Padma Shri, and the Sangeet Natak Akadami Award in the performing arts.         Indrani married Habib Rahman, who was named India's chief architect and who died in 1995. In addition to her daughter, of Orr's Island, Me., she is survived by her son, Ram Rahman, of New Delhi, and two grandsons, Wardreath Wicks of Orr's Island, and Habib Wicks of New York City.       
         Muriel Bentley, an early member of Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater) who was praised for her comic gifts and witty dancing, died on Monday at the Kaiser Permanente Hospital in Woodland Hills, Calif. She was 82 and lived in Los Angeles.         Ms. Bentley was probably best known for her long association with Jerome Robbins. She originated the role of the sassy, purse-toting woman in Robbins's ''Fancy Free.'' Speaking of the character in an interview in The New York Times last year, Ms. Bentley probably inadvertently described her own great charm best. ''My role was modeled after me,'' she said. ''The way I walked, the way I talked. It was like patent leather, shiny and bright and crisp.''         She also performed lead roles in major ballets by Agnes de Mille and Antony Tudor at Ballet Theater, where she danced as a company member from 1940 to 1946 and as a guest artist from 1954 to 1956.         Ms. Bentley created the role of the villainous Stepmother in ''Fall River Legend,'' de Mille's 1948 ballet about Lizzie Borden. Describing the character as ''an incarnation of evil,'' John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, commented that Ms. Bentley had played the role so superbly that ''if the girl had not committed the murder herself almost anybody in the audience would gladly have done it for her.'' She also appeared as a risque young lady in de Mille's 1943 ballet ''Tally-Ho.''         Born in New York, Ms. Bentley studied with teachers like Vecheslav Swoboda, Leon Fokine, Anton Dolin and Ruth St. Denis, and also trained at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School. While still a teen-ager, she danced with St. Denis in 1931 in ''The Prophetess.'' In 1936-37, she performed Spanish dance with Jose Greco, moving on to the Metropolitan Opera Ballet before joining Ballet Theater.         At Ballet Theater, Ms. Bentley also danced major roles in Leonide Massine's ''Capriccio Espagnol,'' in de Mille's ''Three Virgins and a Devil,'' and in Tudor's ''Judgment of Paris,'' ''Undertow'' and ''Gala Performance.'' Ms. Bentley joined Robbins's Ballets: U.S.A. in 1958, performing in ballets that included ''N.Y. Export: Op. Jazz,'' ''The Concert'' and ''Moves.''         Ms. Bentley also performed in Broadway musicals, among them ''Call Me Madam'' and ''West Side Story.''         Ms. Bentley retired from the stage in the early 1960's and worked for a time in New York as an interior designer and a theatrical agent before moving to Los Angeles in the 1970's.         She continued to work into the late 1980's in performing arts management.         She has no immediate survivors.

         Lucienne Bloch, an acclaimed muralist whose most significant contribution to art may have been a series of surreptitious photographs she took in 1933, died on March 13 at her home in Gualala, Calif. She was 90.         She was the photographer whose sneak pictures taken behind enemy lines on May, 8, 1933, are the sole visual record of the great Diego Rivera's ill-fated Rockefeller Center fresco with its doomed depiction of Lenin.         At a time of economic distress, when capitalism itself seemed vulnerable to competing currents of social change, if anybody was going to pin Lenin on a capitalist wall it was Diego Rivera, the fiery Mexican muralist whose artistic acclaim was matched only by his reputation as a fiercely committed, if renegade, Communist.         If anybody was going to stop him it was John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s son, Nelson A. Rockefeller, who had commissioned Rivera to paint a 1,000-square-foot fresco, ''Man at the Crossroads,'' in the great hall of the new RCA Building, the soaring Rockefeller Center capstone now known as the G.E. Building and at the time an especially potent symbol of capitalism.         Sure enough, when it became apparent that Rivera was intent on portraying Lenin as a charismatic leader, Rockefeller asked him to substitute an anonymous figure, and Rivera refused.         Realizing his work was doomed, Rivera hired a photographer to take pictures of the mural, but Rockefeller, determined that there be no record of what the family regarded as desecration of their property, had guards at the building thwart the effort.         Aware that the mural would be sealed off the next day, the Rockefellers could be complacent, but only because they had not reckoned on  Miss Bloch, an unpaid Rivera assistant who seemed an unlikely foot soldier in his anti-capitalist cause.         A Geneva-born daughter of the celebrated Swiss composer, Ernst Bloch, she was a child of privilege who had come to the United States with her family in 1917 and lived in Cleveland until 1925, when her father became director of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and her mother, aware that the composer would be comforted by mistresses, took her children to Paris.         There, Miss Bloch studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and made a yearlong side trip to the Netherlands, studying at the Leerdam glass works and turning out such impressive glass sculptures that she had a one-woman show in New York in 1931 and was invited by Frank Lloyd Wright to teach at his Wisconsin school.         By then, however, she had become fascinated by another art. Shortly after her arrival in New York in 1931, she was invited to a banquet honoring Rivera in connection with his famous one-man show at the Museum of Modern Art. Largely because Rivera spoke little English and no one else spoke Spanish, the 22-year-old Miss Bloch, who spoke French, a language Rivera also knew, was seated next to the great man.         During their animated conversation, a dark-haired woman came up behind Miss Bloch and said, ''I hate you,'' a comment of such disarming candor that Miss Bloch burst out laughing. The woman was Rivera's wife, the tortured artist Frida Kahlo, whose husband's philandering gave her reason to fear the worst, but not, as it happened, from Miss Bloch.         As the the daughter of a womanizing father, Miss Bloch made clear, she had no designs on Kahlo's womanizing husband, a pledge that laid the groundwork for a remarkable friendship.         Over the next few years, Miss Bloch worked on Rivera's controversial mural at the Detroit Institute of Art and on the Rockefeller Center project, along the way falling in love with the artist's chief plasterer, Stephen P. Dimitroff, a young Bulgarian immigrant, and immortalizing their romance in lyrical passages in her diary, which a granddaughter, Lucienne Allen, plans to use as the basis for a book.         The couple, who eventually married, became an artistic team, he handling the plaster and she the painting for frescoes all over the country, including her most acclaimed work, ''The Evolution of Music,'' at George Washington High School in upper Manhattan.         They lived for a time in Flint, Mich., where he became a union organizer and she photographed strikes for Life and other publications, before eventually moving to Mill Valley, Calif., where Mr. Dimitroff, who died in 1996, operated a frame shop until the couple retired to Gualala in 1965.         After a lifetime devoted to art, including wide-ranging sculptures in glass, wood and terra cotta and a famous series of photographs of Kahlo, Miss Bloch is nevertheless largely recalled for her association with another artist's work, but, then, the artist was Rivera, widely regarded as a 20th century giant, and her photographs are all that remain of his most famous work.         For that, Miss Bloch, who is survived by two sons, George Ernst Dimitroff of Tumwater, Wash., and Pancho Dimitroff of Aurora, Colo; a daughter, Sita Milchev, of Gualala; a sister, Suzanne Bloch Smith of New York; 8 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren, had only herself to blame.         It was she, after all, on the night after Rivera's hired photographer had been thwarted, who slipped a camera under her blouse and walked boldly into the RCA building with Mr. Dimitroff and Kahlo, who distracted the guards while Miss Bloch climbed up on the scaffold and proceeded to photograph the mural.         The next day, in what has been likened to a military operation, the mural was shrouded from public view.         Nine months later, after the resulting furor had subsided, it was scraped into oblivion -- almost.         Rivera did a copy in Mexico City, complete with Lenin, but it is only Miss Bloch's photographs that show it as it was -- on a Rockefeller wall.         Correction:  April 6, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary of the muralist Lucienne Bloch on March 28 misspelled the given name of her father. He was Ernest Bloch, not Ernst.       
         Helen Priest Rogers, an authority on dance notation, a co-founder of the Dance Notation Bureau and a pioneer in the use of film to preserve choreography, died on Mar. 2 at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Brattleboro, Vt. She was 85 and lived in West Brattleboro.         Ms. Rogers, who studied modern dance with Martha Graham and performed with the Graham company in 1935, went to Germany in 1936 at Graham's suggestion to learn the new system of Labanotation.         In 1940 she, Eve Gentry, Janey Price and Ann Hutchinson founded the Dance Notation Bureau in New York. It remains one of the world's most important centers for notation research.         Ms. Rogers also believed in recording choreography on film. She made her first dance films at the  Bennington Dance Festivals of the 1930's. After World War II, she taught notation for the American Dance Festival when it was at Connecticut College in New London. From its first season there in 1948 until 1976, when Ms. Rogers turned over her project to other cinematographers, she supervised the filming of 75 productions, including works by  Graham, Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor.         Ms. Rogers, who was married to the Canadian artist Hubert Reginald Rogers, was born in Ogdensburg, N.Y., and attended St. Lawrence University and Columbia University.         She taught dance and notation at various colleges and directed the dance program at Mount Holyoke College from 1953 to 1975.         She is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Scott of Whately, Mass.; a son, Norman Rogers of West Brattleboro; a stepdaughter, Jean Rogers of Provincetown, Mass; a sister, Alice Dunn of Big Arm, Mont.; a brother, Dorman Priest of Amherst, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, who transformed it from a tired magazine into a viable voice in fashion while she battled ovarian cancer and raised awareness of the disease, died yesterday morning at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 51 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.         Ms. Tilberis was highly respected for her ability as an editor, her warmth and her good humor in the face of debilitating treatments to halt the spread of the cancer that ultimately took her life. While hospitalized in December 1993 and again in the summer of 1995, she oversaw each issue of the monthly magazine, which she had taken over in February 1992. Until just a few days before her death, she was working on the June issue.         When Hearst Magazines, which publishes the 132-year-old Harper's Bazaar, hired Ms. Tilberis away from her job as editor in chief of British Vogue, it created a sensation in fashion magazine circles. She became the third reigning British editor of an important New York magazine, following Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue, and Tina Brown, who was then the editor in chief of Vanity Fair and later became the editor of The New Yorker and is now developing Talk magazine.         The fashion world was abuzz with gossip on two topics: speculation that Hearst was paying Ms. Tilberis an annual salary of $1.25 million (never confirmed or denied) and anticipation of a rivalry between Ms. Tilberis and Ms. Wintour, her predecessor at British Vogue, who had recommended Ms. Tilberis as her replacement there. (No outward signs of either hostility or warmth were seen in the years they competed in New York.)         Ms. Tilberis's aim when she took over Harper's Bazaar, she said, was to make it ''the most beautiful fashion magazine in the world.'' She hired talented stylists and famous photographers and brought in Fabien Baron to redesign the look of the magazine. Under his art direction, it developed a strong graphics style,  which was widely copied.         The first issue under Ms. Tilberis's direction, September 1992, had a stunning cover shot by Patrick Demarchelier of the model Linda Evangelista in a stark black dress against a white background with no other headline on the cover than ''Enter the Era of Elegance.'' It was a startling contrast to the usual fashion magazine cover with multiple headlines in different colors. Subsequent issues added text lines and color and eventually looked more like other fashion publications. An exception was this year's February cover of Madonna, also photographed by Mr. Demarchelier, in striking black and red.         Industry reaction to the first change in the magazine was mixed. Some saw it as coolly elegant. Others thought it boring and lifeless. But it won awards, including two National Magazine Awards in 1993.         In 1994, Ms. Tilberis was named editor of the year by Advertising Age and received an award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which was presented to her by Diana, the Princess of Wales. The two women became friends in London, where the Princess of Wales often dropped by the offices of British Vogue and also appeared on its cover twice while Ms. Tilberis was editor. The Princess was also twice on the cover of Harper's Bazaar under Ms. Tilberis's editorship, once during her lifetime and once posthumously.         The September 1994 issue of Harper's Bazaar contained an informative article by Aimee Lee Ball, ''Ovarian Cancer: One Woman's Fight,'' in which Ms. Tilberis linked her use of fertility drugs in the late 1970's to the ovarian cancer that was diagnosed in December 1993. The fertility treatments were unsuccessful. The article described the disease and its treatment, which included nine weeks of chemotherapy, which caused Ms. Tilberis to lose 30 pounds.         In another article in the magazine, in May 1996, Ms. Tilberis described in diary form a bone-marrow transplant she underwent the previous summer to eradicate vestiges of the cancer. In both articles, she chose to find something positive to say about her illness: she had gone from a size 14 to a fashionable size 6 and was pleased that her silver hair was as flattering in its new short length as it had been as a chin-length bob.         She also discussed her battle with the disease in ''No Time to Die,'' a memoir written with Ms. Ball and published last year by Little, Brown. In 1997, Ms. Tilberis became president of the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.         Elizabeth Kelly Tilberis was born Sept. 7, 1947 in Alderley Edge, a village outside of Manchester, England, to Jane and Thomas Stuart-Black Kelly. Her father was an eye surgeon, who was a pioneer in laser retinal detachment surgery and in developing soft contact lenses in the 1960's.         She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in fashion design from Leicester Polytechnic, a British school comparable to New York's Fashion Institute of Technology. It was there that she met her future husband, Andrew Tilberis, an artist, who was her tutor. She and her husband later adopted two children, Robert, now 17, and Christopher, 14.         In addition to her husband and sons, she is survived by her relatives in England: her mother, of Bath; her sister, Lois Stuart-Black of London, and her brother, Dr. Grant Kelly of West Sussex. Following her graduation in 1970, Ms. Tilberis went to British Vogue as a fashion assistant and worked her way to the top, becoming editor in chief in 1987.         Ms. Tilberis was active on the New York charity social scene, serving as chairwoman of benefits for causes like pediatric AIDS, the New York City Ballet and the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         She was scheduled to receive a Humanitarian Award in June from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which will now be given posthumously, said Fern Mallis, the council's executive director. ''We are pleased that the award was announced earlier and not something added after her death,'' Ms. Mallis said yesterday.         Despite Ms. Tilberis's personal popularity and the publicity her tenure brought to the magazine, Harper's Bazaar never ousted Vogue from its pinnacle as the fashion publication with the largest circulation and the most advertising pages. As time went by under her editorship, the magazine lost some of its specialness and began to look more like other fashion publications. It also lost some high-profile editors and photographers to other magazines.         Unfazed, Ms. Tilberis pronounced herself pleased with the magazine in an interview in 1995. ''I think we made the niche we wanted to make, and I think we are the elegant fashion magazine I wanted to create,'' she said.         In an interview published last year in The Times, Ms. Tilberis discussed the stark contrast between her glamorous job and her illness: ''You can live in the fashion world and go to fashion shows and have your picture taken, et cetera, et cetera. But there's an important balance with what really goes on in life, which is sickness and suffering and people dying. Prior to having cancer, I didn't realize there was this whole different world. It's a great wake-up call.''       
         Patricia Bowman, a founding member of American Ballet Theater, a ballerina of the Radio City Music Hall and the first American ballerina to win critical acclaim and wide popularity as a classical and a musical-theater dancer, died on March 18 in Las Vegas, Nev., her home since 1977. She was believed to be in her early to mid 90's.         A link between two eras of dance, Ms. Bowman began her career when there were no major American ballet companies. She performed on Broadway and in the elaborate live shows offered at motion-picture palaces of the 1920's and 30's. Her sparkling stage personality won her many fans. Yet when American ballet companies began to flourish, she gave authoritative performances in some of the great classics.         A native of Washington, Ms. Bowman studied with various teachers there and in New York and Europe. She became a protegee of Michel Fokine, the Russian ballet choreographer of ''Les Sylphides,'' ''Petrouchka'' and other works, who settled in New York in 1923. Fokine choreographed solos for her, among them ''Tennis,'' a witty sketch she offered in vaudeville shows and as a guest artist with ballet troupes.         Ms. Bowman made her New York debut in the 1920 edition of the revue ''George White's Scandals.'' For many years, she went back and forth between dance forms, touring with the Fokine Ballet, forming a ballroom dance team with Tony de Marco, appearing in pioneering television productions in 1931 and 1939 and serving as ballerina of the Roxy Theater. When Radio City Music Hall opened in 1932, she was appointed its prima ballerina and she continued to perform there occasionally until the early 1950's. She also appeared in the ''Ziegfeld Follies'' of 1934 and with the Mordkin Ballet in 1938.         During the first season of Ballet Theater (now American Ballet Theater) in 1940, she starred in ''Swan Lake,'' ''Giselle,'' ''Les Sylphides'' and other works. Reviewing Ms. Bowman in ''Giselle,'' John Martin wrote in The New York Times that ''besides dancing with complete authority she achieves a dramatic credibility in the difficult first act that very few Giselles can match.'' She returned as guest artist during Ballet Theater's 15th-anniversary season in 1955 and was partnered by Erik Bruhn in ''Les Sylphides.''         After leaving Ballet Theater in 1941, she appeared on Broadway in ''Rhapsody'' in 1944, performed nationwide with opera companies and was a guest dancer at orchestral concerts. She was hostess for the ''Patricia Bowman Show,'' a 13-week CBS television series in 1951. Ms. Bowman directed a ballet school in New York from 1957 until 1977, when she married Albert Kaye and moved to Las Vegas, where she served as a consultant to local dance groups.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Sheila Gruson, an artist who worked as an assistant director  with many opera companies around the world, died yesterday in Tiverton, in Devon, England. She was 48.         The cause was breast cancer, according to her brother, Lindsey.         Ms. Gruson, who lived in Tiverton, was an assistant director with Covent Garden in London and La Fenice in Venice, as well as with opera companies in New York, Hamburg, San Francisco, Seattle and Munich.         Her sculptures were exhibited in England.         Ms. Gruson was born on March 21, 1951, in Tel Aviv, and graduated from Harvard University in 1972. She was a daughter of Sydney Gruson, a former vice chairman of The New York Times Company, who died last year.         Besides her brother, of Kent, Conn., she is survived by her daughter, Nina Lourie, of Tiverton; her mother, Flora Lewis, of Paris, foreign affairs columnist for The International Herald Tribune, and a sister, Kerry Gruson of Miami.       
         Patricia Kerr Ross, former director of the State University of New York's Programs in the Arts, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Albany. She was 60 and lived in Albany.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         As director of the university-wide arts programs from 1971 to 1991, Ms. Ross was instrumental in producing statewide arts festivals, workshops and exhibitions. Over the years her office provided creative assistance and support to artists and arts administrators throughout the State University system.         Ms. Ross helped bring dance to SUNY campuses by producing such festivals as the Early Years of Modern Dance (1981) and Merce Cunningham and the New Dance (1987). Dance Black America (1984) was produced with the Brooklyn Academy of Music and filmed for public television.         From 1979 to 1987 she was executive producer of a series of public television specials, ''SUNY in the Arts on Television.'' She also organized faculty and student visits to artists, actors, directors and producers, as well as the SUNY Writer's Festival of readings, discussions and workshops. In 1985 she was co-producer of ''The Educated Eye,'' an exhibition at the New York State Museum of 400 artworks from 25 SUNY campuses.         Ms. Ross, who taught arts policy at Empire State College, was also director of the Thayer Fellowship, which supported outstanding SUNY arts graduates in their first year of professional activity.         In 1989 she founded and directed what became an annual ''Come Sunday'' celebration of music and dance in Albany's historic Center Square neighborhood. The festival presented such performers as Dizzy Gillespie, Branford Marsalis and Garth Fagan as well as emerging local artists. She retired from the university in 1997.         Ms. Ross is survived by a daughter, Linda Proctor of Concord, N.H.; her companion, George Hofmann, an artist and professor at Hunter College, and two grandchildren.       
         Patricia Zipprodt, the Tony Award-winning costume designer whose career extended from theater to dance to opera to film and television, died on Saturday at her home in  Greenwich Village. Ms. Zipprodt was 74.         The cause was cancer, according to her sister, Constance Zonka of Chicago.         Quite simply, as a headline writer once put it, Ms. Zipprodt had the gift of garb. In her youth she studied art, and then one day at the ballet she discovered her calling. She wanted to make the dresses.         ''I'll design for the ballet,'' she recalled telling herself. ''I'll paint with fabric.''         Years later she described a play as a painting that moves. ''Instead of it holding still and you look at it, you hold still and it scrolls by,'' she said.         Although she realized her early dream of designing costumes for ballet, she also designed for scores of Broadway shows, won Tony Awards for ''Fiddler on the Roof'' (1964), ''Cabaret'' (1966) and ''Sweet Charity'' (1985), along with many other prizes.         Her costumes graced musicals like ''Pippin'' (1972) and ''Chicago'' (1975), Broadway plays like ''Plaza Suite'' (1968), ''Brighton Beach Memoirs'' (1983) and ''The Glass Menagerie'' (1983).         Off Broadway, her credits included ''Our Town'' (1959), ''The Balcony'' (1960), ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad, Mamma's Hung You in the Closet and I'm Feelin' So Sad'' (1962) and ''The Blacks'' (1962).         She did wardrobes for the Boston Opera, the New York City Opera and the Metropolitan Opera and for American Ballet Theater, the New York City Ballet, the Houston Ballet and Ballet Hispanico.         In Hollywood she left her imprint on ''The Graduate'' (1967). On television she designed costumes for productions like ''The Glass Menagerie'' on ABC in 1973 and ''Alice in Wonderland'' on WNET in 1983.         Analyzing Ms. Zipprodt's talent, the actor Joel Grey, who worked with her in ''Cabaret'' in 1966, said: ''Her hands were all over the work, whether or not it had to do with making a diaper for Father Time or this very tattered but elegant master-of-ceremonies tail coat.''         Ms. Zipprodt's costumes for ''The Blacks'' brought her to the attention of Jerome Robbins, who hired her when he made his debut as a director with ''Oh Dad, Poor Dad.'' He called on her again for his next show, the hit ''Fiddler on the Roof.'' From Robbins, she said, she learned how to use color to help the audience track the main characters.         In 1990 she spent six months researching and designing more than 300 costumes for the 38-member cast of ''Shogun,'' the muscial based on the James Clavell novel about a shipwrecked 17th-century English navigator who is pivotal in a power struggle among five Japanese overlords.         Despite a million-dollar budget, the assignment, Ms. Zipprodt said, was harder than her work on ''Sunday in the Park With George'' (1984), when the challenge was to design costumes that suggested pointillism without actually using dots; or on the 1977 Metropolitan Opera production of ''Tannhauser,'' which called for more than 200 people to appear onstage at one point.         For ''Shogun'' Ms. Zipprodt traveled to Japan, studied the weaving industry in Kyoto that dated back to the world of ''Shogun'' and visited and photographed Kabuki theaters, samurai-movie studios, gardens, castles and textile mills.         In New York she sought out Japanese women to consult on tradition and custom and experimented in a workshop on West 22d Street with ways to duplicate ancient decorative techniques. (The show was fated to run for only 72 performances.)         Ms. Zipprodt was born in Chicago on Feb. 24, 1925. She was the eldest of three daughters of Agnes Irene Turpin and Herbert Edward Zipprodt, an advertising executive. In 1947 she earned a bachelor's degree from Wellesley College in Massachusetts.  After graduation, she returned to Chicago and fell in love with Lieut. Col. Robert O'Brien Jr., an Army cavalryman, but declined his proposal because she felt she must go to New York to discover if she had artistic talent.         By the 1950's Ms. Zipprodt was living the bohemian life in New York, where she painted at the Art Students League, studied at the Fashion Institute of Technology and waited on tables at Schrafft's until her visit to the ballet altered her life forever.         About seven or eight years ago, after Colonel O'Brien had married, retired and become a widower, he came across a biography of Ms. Zipprodt in a copy of Playbill in Washington. It mentioned that she was an artist in residence at Brandeis University's theater department. The colonel called Brandeis and asked for her phone number, which the university would not give out. So he told the university to call her and pass along a message: ''Bob O'Brien called, and I want to marry her.'' The university did as instructed.         Ms. Zipprodt and the colonel were married on June 5, 1993. She lived in  Upperville, Va., and in New York. Colonel O'Brien died in 1998. Ms. Zipprodt was inducted into the Theatrical Hall of Fame in 1992.         As meticulous as she might be, as committed to researching history, assessing color, collecting swatches, cords and tassels and overseeing the  construction of costumes, Ms. Zipprodt never forgot that her quest for authenticity and beauty was in the service of the hectic and sometimes harrowing institution of show business.         ''Velcro,'' she once said, ''is our favorite word.''       
         Rummana Hussain, a painter and conceptual artist who was also active in Indian politics, died on July 5 at her home in Bombay. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, said the photographer Ram Rahman, a friend.         Ms. Hussain, who came from a prominent Muslim family in Bombay, was for much of her career a painter of allegorical figurative subjects. But political events in India, particularly the destruction of a mosque by Hindu militants in the city of Ayodhya in 1992 and the subsequent attacks on Muslims, spurred her into political action and changed the direction of her work.         She participated in demonstrations protesting both the Ayodhya incident and growing religious nationalism in India. She developed a photo-based feminist art that brought images of ruined architecture, land and the female body together in pointed combinations.         As an artist in residence at Art in General, an alternative space in Manhattan, she created a video-based installation last fall. Titled ''In Between,'' the video combined images of Bombay with others of South Asian immigrant life in New York and alternated shots of the artist under treatment in a Manhattan hospital with others of her walking across the Queensboro Bridge wearing the tinkling ankle bells of an Indian classical dancer.         Ms. Hussain showed widely in India and in Europe         She is survived by her husband, Ishaat, and a daughter, Shazmin.       
         Altina Schinasi Miranda, who is credited with designing the flared-frame Harlequin eyeglasses, which first came into vogue in the late 1930's and which have made kitschy comebacks from time to time, died on Thursday at her home in Santa Fe, N.M. She was 92.         Mrs. Miranda came up with the idea for the pointy glasses while working as a window display designer on Fifth Avenue in Manhattan. In an optician's window nearby, she noticed the humdrum round eyeglasses for women and decided to design something different.         Her new glasses were initially rejected by the major manufacturers, but Mrs. Miranda allied herself with a stylish optical shop, Lugene, on Madison Avenue, where one of the first pairs was sold to the writer Clare Boothe Luce. Other New York trendsetters followed Mrs. Luce's lead, and by the late 1930's, Harlequin glasses were the rage.         Mrs. Miranda's glasses were hailed by magazines like Vogue and Life, and she decided to establish her own company to distribute them. In 1939 she received an American Design Award from Lord & Taylor for the Harlequins, which remained fashionable through the 1950's and enjoyed a resurgence of hip popularity in the early 1990's.         ''If you look at any 'I Love Lucy' rerun, if Lucille Ball is wearing glasses, they are Harlequin glasses,'' said David Mayhew of Maplewood, N.J., a friend of Mrs. Miranda's family.         Mrs. Miranda was born on Aug. 4, 1907, in a Manhattan mansion to Moussa and Laurette Schinasi. Mr. Schinasi, once a poor Turkish immigrant, had become a millionaire through his patented cigarette-rolling machine, which led to the establishment of a company that manufactured ''ready rolled'' cigarettes.         In the mid-1940's Mrs. Miranda sold her eyeglass interests and moved to Los Angeles. She later became a filmmaker, producing a film about George Grosz, the Weimar artist, with whom she had once studied.         In 1981 she relocated to Santa Fe  and continued work as a visual artist until her health began to decline in recent years.         She is survived by her husband, Celestino Miranda; a son, Terry Sanders of Los Angeles, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Eugenie Marron, a renowned big-game fisherwoman a half-century ago, died on Monday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 99.         In her heyday, Mrs. Marron, who lived in Brielle, N.J., and Palm Beach, Fla., held five world fishing records; one women's record, for a 722-pound swordfish caught in 1954 off Chile, remains unbroken, according to the International Game Fish Association in Dania Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Marron traveled the world for big-game fish with her husband, Louis E. Marron, who holds the men's record with a 1,182-pound swordfish caught off Chile in 1953.         She wrote a book about her fishing experiences called ''Albacora: The Search for the Giant Broadbill'' (Random House 1957). Mrs. Marron also assisted in research at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the University of Miami about the central nervous system of the giant squid.         Mrs. Marron was born on Nov. 22, 1899, in Jersey City and received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Columbia University. She was also an artist and sculptor; she studied with Alexander Archipenko.         She is survived by two nieces, Eugenie Wikberg of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., and Suzanne J. Treacy of Deerfield Beach, Fla.       
         Claudette Sorel, a pianist who was at her best in music that demanded delicacy and lyricism but who also gave highly regarded performances of difficult contemporary works and big Romantic showpieces, died on Friday at her home in Hampton Bays, N.Y. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for the J. Ronald Scott Funeral Home in Hampton Bays.         Ms. Sorel was born in Paris in 1932, and was already a promising pianist when her family fled France just before the German invasion in 1940. When her family settled in New York, Ms. Sorel became a student of the Hungarian concert pianist Sari Biro. In 1942 she received a scholarship to the Juilliard School, where she studied with Olga Samaroff.         After a year at Juilliard, Ms. Sorel made her recital debut at Town Hall at age 11. Noel Straus, reviewing the concert in The New York Times, wrote of her performance of a Mendelssohn Etude that ''a child capable of so polished and eloquent an example of pianism has a future worth watching.''         With Samaroff's encouragement she performed regularly in recitals and as an orchestral soloist. Once Samaroff arranged for her to play the Prokofiev Piano Concerto No. 3, a work she had never studied, on a week's notice. She performed several times in the New York Philharmonic's youth concerts before making her formal debut with the orchestra, at age 17, with the MacDowell Piano Concerto No. 2.         As her career progressed, she continued her studies. After Samaroff's death in 1948 she enrolled at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Rudolf Serkin and Mieczyslaw Horszowski. She received an artist's diploma from Curtis in 1953 and a bachelor's degree in mathematics from Columbia University the same year.         During the 1940's and 50's Ms. Sorel toured as a soloist, often including on her programs works written for her by American composers, among them Lukas Foss, Howard Hanson, Paul Creston and Peter Mennin. Her last performance in New York was a 1973 recital at Alice Tully Hall devoted entirely to music by Rachmaninoff, in honor of the centenary of his birth. Included on the program were two previously unknown Nocturnes that Rachmaninoff composed when he was 14. Ms. Sorel had discovered them while researching the composer at the Moscow Conservatory. She edited the published versions of the works.         A fall on an icy sidewalk in 1974 ended her performing career. But Ms. Sorel, who had no immediate survivors, was established as a teacher by then. She taught at the  University of Kansas, Ohio State University and the State University of New York at Fredonia.         Besides the Rachmaninoff works, Ms. Sorel edited some of Arensky's piano works for publication. She also published several books for pianists, including ''A Compendium of Piano Technique,'' ''17 Little Piano Studies'' and ''Mind Your Musical Manners.'' Recently she edited ''From Madam: Selected Writings of Olga Samaroff Stokowski From Her Years at the Juilliard School.''       
         M. C. Richards, a poet, potter, essayist, translator and painter, who taught at Black Mountain College in the late 1940's and thereafter became an impassioned advocate of community in both art and life, died on Friday at Camphill Village, an agricultural community in Kimberton, Pa., where she had lived since 1984. She was 83.         An artist who wrote poems about pottery and made pots inspired by her reading, Ms. Richards was perhaps best known for ''Centering in Pottery, Poetry and the Person,'' a book of essays published in the middle of the tumultuous 1960's that was impressive for its synthesis of thought, plain speech and incantatory momentum. The book, which became an underground classic, pulled together ideas about perception, craft, education, creativity, religion and spirituality, arguing for the richness of daily experience if carefully attended to, and the creativity of the average person. ''Poets are not the only poets,'' Ms. Richards wrote.         Mary Caroline Richards was born in Weiser, Idaho, in 1916 and reared in Portland, Ore. She earned a bachelor's degree in literature and languages from Reed College in 1937, with a thesis titled ''Poetry of the Tang Dynasty in Relation to Western Imagism.'' She went on to the University of California at Berkeley, where she studied Chinese and wrote her Ph.D. dissertation on irony in Thomas Hardy in 1942. She then began a brief marriage, and taught English at the Central Washington College of Education in Ellensburg, Wash., and at the University of Chicago. But she found academic life stifling.         In 1945 she married Albert William Levi Jr., her second husband and a social scientist who was invited that year to join the faculty of the experimental Black Mountain College, near Asheville, N.C. Black Mountain was a short-lived laboratory for innovative teaching and art whose faculty and students included Josef and Anni Albers, John Cage, Merce Cunningham, David Tudor, Robert Rauschenberg and Charles Olson.         At Black Mountain Ms. Richards taught writing, produced and, when necessary, translated plays by Cocteau, Satie and Yeats. She also danced and studied pottery with Robert Turner. Around 1950 she participated in what might have been the first ''happening,'' with Cage, Olson, Mr. Rauschenberg and Franz Kline. In 1951 she separated from her husband, whom she later divorced, and in 1952 she went to New York with Tudor.         She studied pottery at Greenwich House in Greenwich Village, attended the meetings of the downtown avant-garde known as the Club and worked on the first English translation of Antonin Artaud's influential ''Theater and Its Double,'' published by Grove Press in 1958.         In 1954 Ms. Richards, Tudor and Cage, along with Paul Williams, an architect, and Karen Karnes, a potter, who had both also been at Black Mountain, established a commune called the Land near Stony Point, N.Y. Ms. Richards lived there for a decade, working in a studio with Ms. Karnes; they developed a form of flame-proof clay that enabled them to make ceramic cookware.         Ms. Richards began giving pottery workshops in the early 1960's. Reflecting the ideas that would figure in ''Centering,'' these became increasingly interdisciplinary, with titles like ''Clay and Words,'' ''Clay and Movement'' and ''Clay and Eurythmy.'' She lectured and taught workshops at schools in the United States, Canada and Britain. Her longest teaching affiliation, from 1986 until her death, was with the University of Creation Spirituality, established in Oakland, Calif., by Matthew Fox, a Dominican priest.         Ms. Richards's books, which often mixed prose and poetry, included ''The Crossing Point'' (1973), ''Opening Our Moral Eye'' (1996), ''Imagine Inventing Yellow'' (1991) and ''Toward Wholeness: Rudolf Steiner Education in America,'' a work of social philosophy. The Camphill community in Kimberton is one of 80 Camphills worldwide based on Steiner's teachings.         In 1989 Ms. Richards, who has no survivors, added painting to her roster of activities. She then exhibited ceramics, poems and paintings together, most recently at the Works Gallery in Philadelphia in 1997. The Worcester Center for Crafts in Massachusetts is organizing a retrospective of her work that is to open on  Oct. 9, with a public memorial.         Ms. Richards embraced old age with characteristic openness, writing  a poem in 1997 in which she saw herself as ''living toward dying, blooming into invisibility.''         Correction:  September 23, 1999, Thursday  An obituary of the poet and potter M. C. Richards on Monday misstated the date of her death. It was Sept. 10, not Sept. 17.       
         Sigrid de Lima, a writer whose early works won praise but who withdrew from public life in midcareer, died on Sunday at a hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 77 and lived in Valley Cottage, N.Y.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter, Alison de Lima Greene.         Ms. de Lima burst upon the New York literary scene in 1950 with ''Captain's Beach,'' the first published novel to come out of the editor Hiram Haydn's prestigious workshop at the New School for Social Research. The tale of a handful of threadbare survivors in a shabby rooming house on the New York waterfront, the book met with mixed reviews with critics simultaneously proclaiming Ms. de Lima the next Hemingway, Dostoyevsky or Woolf, or calling her writing ''painfully studied and even windy.''         Ms. de Lima fared better with her second work, ''The Swift Cloud'' (1952), about the murder of a disabled child in a California town. The book was well received.         Her slim body of work won her a Prix de Rome in 1953, with a fellowship in literature at the American Academy of Arts and Letters in Rome. There she met and married a fellow winner, Stephen Greene, an artist.         With her ''Carnival by the Sea'' (1954), described in The Times as ''the moving story of a lovely lost Eurydice, wandering in the gaudy hell of a modern amusement park,'' critics were generally agreed on her considerable skills. After only two more works, ''Praise a Fine Day'' in 1959 and ''Oriane'' in 1968, both of which met with acclaim, Ms. de Lima ceased writing for publication, preferring instead to spend time with her family, Ms. Greene said.         In addition to her daughter, of Houston, she is survived by her husband.       
         Jeanne Miles, an American painter of luminous geometric abstractions, died last Friday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 90.         Ms. Miles was born in Baltimore and grew up in Washington. She was the first woman to enroll in the art school at George Washington University. In 1937, she was given a travel grant and, determined to use it for something exotic, went to Tahiti for a year to paint. She later studied in Paris at the Atelier Marcel Gromaire and the Grand Chaumiere.  She left France after the start of World War II and came to New York, where she lived and worked in Greenwich Village for many years. She moved to Los Angeles two years ago.         Ms. Miles exhibited for many years with the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York during the gallery's  heyday, from 1943 to 1959, and counted artists like Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Bradley Walker Tomlin among her friends. More recently, she had solo shows in Manhattan at the Marilyn Pearl Gallery in 1988 and at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in 1994.         The paintings in the Shapolsky show were modest in scale, based on circular and starlike patterns done in shades of rich jade green interspersed with passages of gold leaf. Although abstract, they suggested both illuminated manuscript pages and mandalas. The work reflected both the artist's long-standing interest in Asian art and thought, and her commitment to the spiritual implications of Western modernist art. ''The mandala form is universal and deeply fixed in our psyche,'' she said in an interview.         Ms. Miles's paintings were included in many group shows from the 1930's on at the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, among other institutions. Her work is in the permanent collection of the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Guggenheim, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Newark Museum and elsewhere.         She received grants from the Yaddo Art Colony and the McDowell Art Colony, an award from the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1968, and two Mark Rothko awards, in 1970 and 1973. She taught at Oberlin College, Moravian College and Yale University.         Ms. Miles is survived by a daughter, the actress Joanna Miles; a grandson, Miles Brandman, and a sister, Kitty Daffron of Florida.       
         Lenon Hoyte, better known as Aunt Len, who shared her dream of a doll museum with Harlem children and  collectors from around the world for two decades, died Aug. 1 at a hospital in New York. She was 94.         A public school art teacher, she  founded Aunt Len's Doll and Toy Museum, one of the most extensive private collections of dolls and related toys in the United States, and long one of New York City's choice specialty museums. She closed the museum in the early 1990's when she was no longer able to care for it.         To Ms. Hoyte, the dolls were her ''babies,'' to be loved and shown off, whether they were the rarest antiques or battered castoffs.         In 1938, Ms. Hoyte and her husband bought the three-story brownstone at 6 Hamilton Terrace between Convent and St. Nicholas Avenues.         At one time the house was home to 6,000 dolls.         There were a dozen versions of  Shirley Temple; there was Barbie, and Betsy Wetsy, presidents and their wives, and refined French dolls with bodies and faces made of  bisque, the unglazed ceramic ware used to make fine dolls in the 19th century and before.         And always, her collection included black dolls, which are now highly sought by collectors, because so few were made before the 20th century.         One rarity, described in the sale catalogue as ''a black Bru pressed-bisque-head bebe doll,'' was valued at $18,000.         There were a pair of papier-mache dolls, named Lillian and Leo, made by Leo Moss, a black handyman who lived in Atlanta in the 19th century. Both Lillian and Leo have tears running down their cheeks.         The story has it that after the dollmaker parted from his wife and children he became so sad that he made only crying dolls.         The collection also included accessories like doll houses, doll clothing and costumes, tin toys and stuffed animals.         Visitors had to squeeze their way sideways or hunch down as they progressed through the narrow passageways of the public spaces on the ground floor and in the basement of the building.         The museum had a modest entrance fee, never exceeding $2 for adults and 50 cents for children.         Visitors would encounter all manner of mannequins, ranging from thumb-size to two or three feet tall.  Not all of the collectibles were old. One of Ms. Hoyte's favorites -- a baby doll with wide eyes and long eyelashes -- was carved in mahogany in 1977 by a California artist, Patty Hale.         In 1990, soon after Mayor Edward I. Koch presented Ms. Hoyte with the Mayoral Award of Honor for Art and Culture, her genteel house and museum was broken into by thieves.         At least nine dolls, including a two-foot-tall English king, considered priceless by knowledgeable collectors, were stolen.         Ms. Hoyte was disconsolate.         ''People any more don't let you live,'' she said then. ''You struggle to keep something up for joy and beauty, and you find yourself having to watch for thieves. It's not right.''         But soon after, four of the stolen dolls -- representing George and Martha Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Benjamin Franklin -- turned up, disjointed but repairable, in Ms. Hoyte's front room. ''I don't ask questions about how,'' she said. ''I'm just happy to have them back.''         In 1994, 700 of the finest antique dolls were auctioned at Sotheby's. Thousands more had been sold previously to dealers around the country.         Lenon Holder Hoyte was born in New York City on July 4, 1905, the first of five children of Moses and Rose Holder. She attended public school in New York City and studied art at the College of the City of New York, Columbia University and with private teachers.         She taught art at Junior High School 149 in the Bronx and retired after 41 years. ''When they started killing teachers, I got out,'' she said.         Her passion for collecting dolls dated to 1962, when she was asked to organize a doll show to raise money for Harlem Hospital. After that, she began acquiring dolls from flea markets, garage sales and antiques shops that she visited throughout the United States, Europe and the Caribbean. Her collection was officially opened as a museum in 1974.         Ms. Hoyte continued to produce  doll shows, and donated the proceeds to St. Philip's Episcopal Church, where she had been a lifelong member.         She spent many of her retirement years traveling to doll shows and picking up dolls and doll accouterments for her collection.         Ms. Hoyte's husband, Lewis Hoyte, died about 30 years ago. She is survived by her brother, Dr. Oliver Holder, of Sag Harbor, N.Y., two nieces and three nephews.       
         Katie Webster, the blues and boogie-woogie pianist and singer known as the Swamp Boogie Queen, a mainstay of Gulf Coast rhythm-and-blues recordings in the 1950's and 60's and a popular touring artist in the 80's and early 90's, died on Sunday at her home in League City, Tex. She was 63.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter Elizabeth Vereen.         Ms. Webster, born Kathryn Jewel Thorne, was reared by musicians: her father was a ragtime pianist who turned to gospel music when he became a minister in the Sanctified Church of God in Christ, in Houston, and her mother, who played spirituals and classical music, was responsible for her keyboard training.         She began her professional musical life early, although it was not the sort her parents would have encouraged: at 13 she was traveling the ''crawfish circuit'' from Dallas to New Orleans with a jazz band. At 15 she married the pianist Earl Webster, and around that time the guitarist and singer Ashton Savoy tookMs. Webster to south Louisiana to make a recording with him.         This was the beginning of a studio career that would encompass hundreds of records on Louisiana labels including Goldband and Excello. She recorded with many of the area's best-known regional musicians, including Slim Harpo, Lightnin' Slim, Clifton Chenier and Guitar Junior. She played on the original version of ''Sea of Love,'' by Phil Phillips.         In 1964 Otis Redding played at the Bamboo Club, the Lake Charles bar where Ms. Webster's band the Uptighters often played. Redding was so taken by the heavy and exact timekeeping of her left hand that he hired her immediately; for the next three years she was both his opening act and the pianist in his band. (She played on such well-known Redding albums as ''Live at the Whiskey-a-Go-Go.'')         She was pregnant and on leave from the band in 1967 when Mr. Redding undertook his final tour and died in a plane crash.         Ms. Webster did not restart her career until 1982, when she toured Europe for the first time; her hollering voice and her charismatic innuendo-laden performances won her fans, and her second act had begun. She performed in the San Francisco Bay Area and around Europe through the 1980's and recorded for the Arhoolie and Alligator labels, with Bonnie Raitt and Robert Cray showing their support in guest appearances.         A stroke in 1993 damaged her playing and her eyesight, although she continued to perform sporadically.         In addition to Ms. Vereen, of League City, she is survived by another daughter, Audrey Johnson of Houston; two sisters, Earline Allen of Houston and Irma Dews of San Pablo, Calif.; three brothers, Cyrus, Robert and Cornelius Thorne, all of San Francisco; eight grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Wilma Curley, a ballet and Broadway dancer who became noted for restaging works by Jerome Robbins, died on Oct. 16 at St. Luke's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 62 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was liver failure, said the dancer Christian Holder, a friend.         Ms. Curley was born in Brooklyn and trained in dance at the New York City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet. She performed with City Ballet from 1944 to 1957 and toured with Robbins's Ballets: U.S.A. from 1958 to 1961. Ms. Curley created roles in Robbins's ''Concert,'' ''New York Export: Op. Jazz'' and ''Moves'' and John Butler's ''Unicorn, the Gorgon and the Manticore.''         One of Robbins's favorite dancers, Ms. Curley helped the choreographer with revivals of his dances and later became known herself for restaging his ballets for companies that included American Ballet Theater, City Ballet and the Joffrey Ballet. Ms. Curley was best known for her stylish, vibrant stagings of ''New York Export: Op. Jazz.''         ''I think what appealed to Jerry was that she was a very unadorned dancer,'' Mr. Holder, whom Ms. Curley cast in Robbins ballets at the Joffrey, said. ''She was pivotal in the creation of many of those pieces, and so she was able to provide us with a psychological blueprint of Robbins.''         Ms. Curley also performed on Broadway in musicals, including ''I Can Get It for You Wholesale'' and ''West Side Story,'' in which she created the role of Graziella. She performed as a guest artist at Radio City Music Hall, on the television shows of Ed Sullivan, Perry Como and Garry Moore and in summer theater at Jones Beach. Ms. Curley also choreographed dances for the Alabama State Ballet, Harkness Ballet and Joffrey second company, for which she created her best-known piece, a comic ballet called ''Mother's Mozart '73'' in 1973.         Ms. Curley's marriage to Pat Harrison ended in divorce. She is survived by two sons, Timothy and Gene, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Gail Clark of Cherry Hill, N.J., and Joan O'Brien, of Nanuet, N.Y.; and two granddaughters.       
         Laura Adasko Lenzner, an artist who worked in pastel, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 50 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Allan Lenzner.         Ms. Lenzner, who went by Laura Adasko professionally, was born in Brooklyn and educated at the Art Students League in Manhattan and Mills College in Oakland, Calif. She began her career working in batik. With her business partner Alice Huberman, Ms. Lenzner created colorful fabrics in the early 1970's.         She later began working in pastels and her work has been shown at the Blue Mountain Gallery in SoHo, the Albright-Knox Art Gallery in Buffalo and the Elaine Benson Gallery in Bridgehampton, N.Y.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her sons, Benjamin, of Northfield, Minn., and Samuel and David, of New York; her mother, Mary Adasko, and a brother, Hardy Adasko, both of Brooklyn.       
         Lee Lozano, an eccentric artist who pursued Conceptual Art and painting in the 1960's and then left the New York art world for self-imposed exile that included an embargo on contact with other women, died on Oct. 2 in the Dallas Health and Rehabilitation Center in Texas.  She was 68 and lived in Dallas.         The cause was cervical cancer, said Mark Kramer, the artist's cousin.         Ms. Lozano was a quixotic, confounding rebel whose decadelong New York career seemed always to involve pushing one limit or another. Her early paintings, executed in an Expressionistic cartoon style, confronted issues of sexual and painterly decorum. They featured a robust messiness, distorted close-ups of the body, intimations of violence and suggestively exaggerated images of tools.         By 1967 she had taken the systemic approach of Minimalism, making nearly monochromatic ''Wave'' paintings based on wavelengths that pushed the limits of visual perception. In the mid-1960's she also began to execute a series of life-related actions (she didn't like the word performance) that tested, among other things, her stamina, her friends' patience and the conduct of everyday life. These works reflected her friendship with Conceptually inclined artists like Sol LeWitt, Hollis Frampton, Dan Graham and Carl Andre. They also reflected an increasing disenchantment with the art world that bordered on hostility.         Many of these pieces were proposed or recorded in written works that she considered drawings. Sometimes she designated everyday activities like thought, conversation or marijuana smoking as art, attracted by the idea that they were unsaleable and democratic. Her ''Throw-Up Piece'' proposed throwing the 10 most recent issues of Artforum, the leading magazine of contemporary art, in the air and letting them fall where they may. In ''Transistor Radio Piece'' she listened to a radio while attending a panel discussion on art.         In 1969 and 1970 Ms. Lozano began a steady withdrawal from the art world in works that she titled ''General Strike Piece'' and ''Dropout Piece.'' She decided to boycott women for a month or two as a means of improving communication with them. For unexplained reasons, she continued this piece to the end of her life, despite the great inconvenience and, one supposes, even greater rudeness.         Ms. Lozano was born Lee Knastner in Newark in 1930. She received a B.A. from the University of Chicago in 1951 and studied painting at the Art Institute of Chicago. A brief marriage in the late 1950's to an architect, Adrian Lozano, ended in divorce. She leaves no survivors.         Ms. Lozano had her first exhibition at the Bianchini Gallery in New York in 1966 and was then associated with the Green Gallery. In 1998 her work, long absent from the New York scene, returned when three SoHo galleries, Mitchell Algus, Rosen & Van Liere and Margarete Roeder, each showed a different phase of her painting. At the same time the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford exhibited her ''Wave'' paintings and notebooks. All the dealers and curators involved with these exhibitions were men.       
         Gloria Caruso Murray, a visual artist who was the last surviving child of Enrico Caruso, died on Dec. 5 at St. Luke's Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 79 and had briefly tried to live up to the musical world's sentimental fantasy that she had inherited her father's vocal abilities.         She died of cancer, said Aldo Mancusi, curator of the Caruso Museum in Brooklyn.         Only hours after his daughter's birth on Dec. 18, 1919, at the Knickerbocker Hotel just a stone's throw from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York, Caruso, then the most famous operatic tenor in the world, exuberantly tossed the girl into the air, peered into her mouth and announced, ''Ah, she has the vocal cords, just like her daddy!''         A year and a half later, Caruso was dead at 48 -- a loss that nourished a popular fantasy that his child would also have an extraordinary voice.         At age 7, when she and her mother returned to New York from a vacation in Europe, a New York newspaper ran the headline ''Gloria Caruso, Here With a Voice'' and pronounced her ''a potential opera star of the first magnitude.''         The next year she made her first record. At 11, she made her first public appearance, delivering a radio address on behalf of a charity headed by President Herbert Hoover. Later that year she made a test recording for RCA Victor, and John McCormack, another renowned tenor, gave her singing lessons and announced that she had promise.         The press had an immense appetite for even the slightest tidbits of news about the great Caruso's daughter. But it gradually became apparent that she did not have the voice to follow her father.         In 1942, Ms. Murray told a reporter that she was studying art at the Art Students League in New York and that she had come to prefer the visual arts to music. ''I've always been torn between art and music,'' she said. ''Daddy drew and sculptured as a hobby. And Mommy draws. Art is as much in the family as singing.''         In marrying Caruso, her mother, an American named Dorothy Benjamin, created a tumult in 1918. Her father, Park Benjamin, a wealthy patent lawyer and New York society figure, fiercely opposed the match between his daughter, then 25, to Caruso, who was 45. After the couple eloped, Park Benjamin disowned her. When he died in 1925, he left her $1 from his substantial estate.         In 1943, Gloria Caruso married Ensign Michael Hunt Murray, who had left Harvard to become a naval aviator in World War II. The couple had two sons but later divorced.         Ms. Murray set up a studio in New York City where she painted both portraits and landscapes. Later she lived in Miami and, for the last 10 years, in Jacksonville.         Andrew Farkas, co-author with Enrico Caruso Jr. of ''Enrico Caruso: My Father and My Family'' (Amadeus Press, 1990), said that Ms. Murray's paintings were ''of good quality, although she sold very few.''         ''She became rather reclusive,'' Mr. Farkas said, adding, ''She had been answering questions about her father for a long time.'' Eric D. Murray, one of Ms. Murray's sons, said his mother had become occupied with managing the family estate after her mother died in 1957.         Matters were complicated because Caruso had left no will. In 1928, a court in Trenton had ruled that Gloria Caruso was entitled to two-thirds of the royalties on her father's phonograph records, sold by the Victor Talking Machine Company.         Gloria Caruso attended Miss Hewitt's Classes in New York City, the Ozanne School in Paris, the Bishop School in La Jolla, Calif., and Miss Nixon's School in Florence, Italy.         In addition to her son Eric, of Maryland, she is survived by her other son, Colin D. Murray of Jacksonville.         Mr. Farkas wrote that Enrico Caruso had four children from a relationship with Ada Giacchetti, a soprano who had left her husband to live with the tenor before his marriage to Miss Benjamin. Only one, Enrico Caruso Jr., sought a career as a singer. All are deceased.
