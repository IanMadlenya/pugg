         Louise Reinhardt Smith, a discerning collector of modern art and a prized supporter of the Museum of Modern Art since 1957, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Ms. Smith was one of the last of the strong-willed and independent-minded collectors whose activity was indispensable to the Museum of Modern Art at a time when there was still much new ground to be broken for its core collections.         Agnes Gund, president of the Museum of Modern Art, said yesterday: "Louise Smith brought to art a real, true love. She cared nothing for the social status or the public attention that it could bring. The only people she wanted around her were those who felt for art the way she did.         "Disregarding the safe and the sure, she was drawn to the tough and the difficult in art. Living with the tough pictures in her collection -- the redoubtable Picasso 'Woman Dressing Her Hair' of 1940, for one -- she developed over the years a friendship with them that was deeply moving to witness".         Mrs. Smith's many gifts to the Museum of Modern Art are the subject of an exhibition, "Masterworks From the Louise Reinhardt Smith Collection," which opened at the museum on May 4 and runs through Aug. 22. With the exception of two paintings -- one by Claude Monet, the other by Georges Braque -- that she bequeathed to the Metropolitan Museum, everything in the show will now be part of the Modern's permanent collection. Matisse, Degas, Kandinsky and Seurat are among the major artists represented in the exhibition.         Louise Reinhardt Smith was born in Dallas on March 14, 1904. The daughter of Sidney Reinhardt and Alice Blum Reinhardt, she attended Washington University and the College of the Incarnate Word in San Antonio. In 1964, at the age of 60, she obtained her bachelor's degree from New York University.         For many years she wrote short stories for Ladies' Home Journal and other publications and in 1945 received the O. Henry Award. During her marriage to Bertram Smith, an investment broker in New York City, she kept registered Guernsey cows at the couple's farm in the Berkshires. After her husband's death, she began her long association with the Museum of Modern Art and its international council. She was made a trustee of the museum in 1965 and a trustee for life in 1993.         She is survived by a daughter, Ann Smith, and two grandsons, Bertram and Nicholas Nikola; all of Patterson, N.Y., and a sister, Alice Harrington of San Diego.       
         Oveta Culp Hobby, the creator of the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps in World War II, the first Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare and a longtime executive at the recently closed Houston Post, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 90.         Mrs. Hobby, whose media holdings made her one of the nation's richest women, suffered a stroke in April, her family said.         She went from being a small-town lawyer's well-read daughter to being a regular on fashion magazines' lists of well-dressed women, with her trendy designer gowns and hats from Bergdorf Goodman. She took lessons that erased the drawl from her conversations about the Picasso paintings she collected or the Bartok concertos she heard at the Houston Symphony. She also reorganized the business department of The Houston Post from top to bottom, and she later developed a reputation as a hard-working administrator who prized efficiency in government.         But she was not one to demand the credit.         "Everything that ever happened to me fell in my lap," she once said. "And nothing in my life would have been possible without Governor."         "Governor" was William P. Hobby, an easy-going newspaperman who was the top elected official in Texas from 1917 to 1921; his most notable action as Governor was to call out the state militia to crush a dock strike.         He was hired as publisher of The Houston Post-Dispatch at about the same time that Miss Culp, a friend of Florence Sterling, whose millionaire brother owned the paper, got a job in the circulation department.         Mr. Hobby's first wife died a year later. A couple of years later, after Miss Culp lost a campaign for a seat in the State Legislature, they were seen socializing around Houston. In 1931, when she was 26 and he 53, they were married.         "Will, she'll embarrass you," one of her husband's friends warned. "She doesn't give a hang about clothes."         But she learned to; in the 1950's her name appeared regularly on the lists of best-dressed women. She also learned about newspapers. The Hobbys eventually acquired ownership of The Post and she worked as a book reviewer, copy editor and editorial writer.         Their first child, William P. Hobby Jr., was born on Mrs. Hobby's 27th birthday, and her daughter, Jessica, on her 32d. As the publisher's wife, she became president of the Texas League of Women Voters, a member of the board of the Houston Museum of Fine Arts, a member of the Houston Symphony Orchestra Committee and regional chairman of the Mobilization for Human Needs, all before she was 35.         Mrs. Hobby was born on Jan. 19, 1905, in Killeen, Tex., the daughter of Isaac and Emma Hoover Culp. Her first name was an Indian word that her parents chose because it rhymed with with Juanita, the name of one of her sisters.         Oveta soon demonstrated her independent-mindedness. A temperance campaign swept Killeen when she was 5, and her Sunday school class was asked to sign a pledge. She politely refused. Her grandmother heard about her refusal and had a switch ready. Not until afterward did her grandmother ask why she had refused. "I did not sign because I did not know what that word means -- temperance," she said. Her grandmother apologized.         She was her father's favorite; at 10 she read the Congressional Record in his office, and when he won a seat in the Texas Legislature in 1919 she went with him to Austin.         She briefly attended Mary Hardin Baylor College at Belton, Tex. Miss Culp was soon on the state payroll, in a job codifying statutes for the State Banking Committee. In 1925, when she was 20, a year shy of being old enough to vote, she was appointed parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature. Later she wrote a handbook on parliamentary procedure, "Mr. Chairman," which was used as a textbook throughout the state.         "If I hadn't been parliamentarian of the Texas Legislature, other things would never have been sparked," she said later. "Twenty is a wonderful age for things to be sparked."         One of the things sparked by her duties in Austin was an interest in politics. The 1928 Democratic National Convention was held in Houston, and she worked on senatorial and mayoral campaigns. She later ran for a seat in the State Legislature. Her opponent whispered that she was "a parliamentarian and a Unitarian." She lost. It was the last time she ran for office.         Mrs. Hobby was in Washington in 1941 for a meeting at the Federal Communications Commission -- the family owned radio station KPRC-AM -- when Gen. David Searles asked her to organize a section on women's activities for the Army. The War Department had been receiving 10,000 letters a day from women who wanted to serve their country. But Mrs. Hobby turned him down, saying that she had a husband, two children and a job.         General Searles asked her to draw up an organization chart with recommendations on ways that women could serve, and she did. He repeated his request that she go to work in Washington. She repeated her refusal. Then she told her husband.         "You shouldn't have made him have to ask you a second time," Mr. Hobby reportedly said at the time. "Any thoughtful person knows that we are in this war, and that every one of us is going to have to do whatever we are called upon to do." Mrs. Hobby went to Washington.         Her job was completely new in American military history, and she had to write her own rules. The idea of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps -- the name was changed to Women's Army Corps in 1943 -- was not well received by male commanders. Sergeants had jeeps, but Mrs. Hobby, who held the rank of colonel, had to call for a car from the War Department motor pool.         Members of the WACs enlisted for noncombat duty as medical technicians, cartography clerks, secretaries and similar types of jobs in the United States and in every war theater. By the end of World War II, about 100,000 women had joined the WAC. The organization was dissolved in 1978.         Mrs. Hobby received the Distinguished Service Medal in January 1945 for outstanding service "without guidance or precedents in United States military history.         Back in Houston, she renewed her political contacts and expanded the circulation of The Post, where she was an executive vice president and a director of KPRC, which came to include not only the AM station but also FM and television outlets.         Although she considered herself a conservative Democrat, she backed Gov. Thomas E. Dewey of New York, a Republican, when he ran for President in 1948, and Dwight D. Eisenhower in his successful Presidential campaign in 1952.         In return for her support, Mrs. Hobby was appointed to succeed Oscar E. Ewing as head of the Federal Security Agency. Her post did not have full Cabinet status when she was sworn in, but it was soon elevated to that rank and its name was changed to the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Mrs. Hobby was the nation's second woman to hold a Cabinet post; the first, Frances Perkins, was Secretary of Labor under President Franklin D. Roosevelt from 1933 to 1945.         In 31 months in charge of the department, which had a $1.7 billion annual budget, she oversaw the development of nurses training programs and a hospital reinsurance plan. She was also involved in the announcement of the Salk polio vaccine, and was praised at the time for having the patience to hold the announcement until the vaccine had been properly tested.         When Mrs. Hobby resigned, Treasury Secretary George M. Humphrey was so dismayed that he said, "What? The best man in the Cabinet?"         Mrs. Hobby's reason for leaving Washington was straightforward: "Nothing is as important as Governor."         Her husband had been ill, but he improved once she was back in Houston. For the next nine years, until his death in 1964, they worked out of adjacent offices at The Post or a single large room in their home.         Mrs. Hobby sold The Post to the Toronto Sun Publishing Company in 1983 for about $130 million. The paper changed hands again a few years later, and was finally closed earlier this year.         In 1992, H&C Communications Inc., another family enterprise, sold its five television stations. The sale left H&C with only one broadcast outlet, the Hobby's original station, KPRC-AM in Houston.         Besides her son, who was the Lieutenant Governor of Texas from 1973 to 1991 and was recently named chancellor of the University of Houston, and her daughter, Jessica Catto, of San Antonio, she is survived by a sister, Mrs. Loy Loving, of Weslaco, Tex., 8 grandchildren and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Gloria Chadwick, an international ski racing administrator who was especially dedicated to furthering women's cross-country competition, died on Sunday at her home in Lake Placid, N.Y. She was 63.         Her brother, Norman Chadwick of Mount Vernon, Wash., said she died of cancer.         In her youth, Miss Chadwick was a downhill ski racer on the United States A team. She had wanted to compete at the Olympic level, but a skiing accident in which she broke her leg sidelined that ambition.         Undaunted, she went on to make her mark in the sport through administrative undertakings, and in 1986, was inducted into the United States National Ski Hall of Fame in Ishpeming, Mich.         She had been director of the United States Olympic Training Center in Lake Placid since 1985, and was executive director of the United States Ski Association from 1961-68. She was also the first national coordinator for Nastar, a racing program for recreational skiers.         For the last decade, she focused her efforts on behalf of women in skiing as chairman of the International Ski Federation Subcommittee on Women's Cross-Country.         Miss Chadwick was born in Philadelphia, but her family moved to Lowell, Mass., when she was a toddler. As a teen-ager from a modest home, Miss Chadwick honed her Alpine skills by skiing regularly at nearby Cannon Mountain, N.H.         She received a bachelor's and master's degree in business from the now-defunct Staley College in Brookline, Mass., and later studied management at Santa Clara University in Santa Clara, Calif.         In a breakthrough for women in the ski industry, she was hired in 1971 by the Big Sky Resort near Bozeman, Mont., to be director of marketing, and later, a vice president.         From 1975 to 1983, she was president and general manager of Burke Mountain, Vt. In 1983, she became commissioner of economic development for the state of Vermont.         In 1985, Miss Chadwick opened the United States Olympic Education Center at Northern Michigan University in Marquette, Mich. Later that year, she also began supervising the $12 million modernization of the Lake Placid training center.         During the last two years, she was in charge of developing the ARCO United States Olympic Training Center in Chula Vista, Calif.         Miss Chadwick is survived by her brother.       
         Ida Lupino, an earthy, intelligent movie actress who created a luminous gallery of worldly wise villainesses, gangster's molls and hand-wringing neurotics, died on Thursday night at her home in Burbank, Calif. She was 77 years old.         Miss Lupino had cancer and had recently suffered a stroke, Mary Ann Anderson, her former secretary, said yesterday.         The actress was also celebrated for directing eight provocative and socially relevant feature films and scores of episodes of many long-running television series, including "The Untouchables," "Have Gun, Will Travel" and "Alfred Hitchcock Presents."         In the course of more than 50 films, Miss Lupino was a spiteful Cockney in "The Light That Failed" (1939), a crazed wife in "They Drive by Night" (1940), a loyal girlfriend in "High Sierra" (1941), an escaped convict in "The Sea Wolf" (1941) and a steely murderer in "Ladies in Retirement" (1941).         In later roles, she was a depraved warden in "Women's Prison" (1955), a sob-sister columnist in "While the City Sleeps" (1956) and the world-weary mother of a rodeo star in "Junior Bonner" (1972). Vincent Canby of The New York Times called "Junior Bonner" "a superior family comedy" made to order for both Steve McQueen and Robert Preston, but wrote "the loveliest performance is that of Miss Lupino."         In the early 1950's, she directed and helped write successful low-budget movies on such sensitive issues as illegitimacy ("Not Wanted"), rape ("Outrage") and pathological murder ("The Hitch-Hiker").         On television, she regularly starred in a dramatic anthology, Four Star Playhouse, from 1952 to 1956. In 1957 and 1958 she produced "Mr. Adams and Eve," a situation comedy about married film stars, in which her co-star was Howard Duff, her third husband. Many of the episodes dealt comically with their real-life experiences.         Ida Lupino was born in London on Feb. 4, 1918, during a German zeppelin bombing. Her paternal forebears were traveling players and puppeteers in Renaissance Italy. Later generations migrated to England in the 17th century. Her father, Stanley Lupino, was a noted comedian, and her mother, Connie Emerald, was an actress who was also descended from a theatrical family. A cousin, Lupino Lane, was an internationally popular song-and-dance man.         As a child, she improvised and acted scenes with her younger sister, Rita, in a small theater their father had built for them in their London garden. Her roles included Juliet, Camille and even Hamlet. At the age of 13, she entered the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. At 15, she made her film debut in a Lolita-like role in "Her First Affaire." She made five more movies in Britain in 1933, then signed a contract with Paramount Pictures in Hollywood and played a dozen more sugary ingenues over the next five years.         The turning point came with "The Light That Failed," in which she forcefully played a vengeful prostitute who betrays an artist going blind (Ronald Colman). That performance and her next one, as a demented murderer in "They Drive by Night," won her a long-term contract at Warner Brothers.         Over the next decade, critics increasingly hailed Miss Lupino as one of the great film actresses. Her favorite role was in "Ladies in Retirement," as a stolid housekeeper who kills her overbearing employer so she can use the house as a sanctuary for her two insane sisters. The New York film critics honored her as the best actress of 1943 for her portrayal in "The Hard Way" of a ruthless woman who propels her younger sister to stardom and destroys everyone in her way.         Miss Lupino gracefully disguised the intense effort she put into shaping her roles, displaying an economy of motion and an ease in using precisely on-target gestures and intonation. She insisted she was not a born actress, saying: "I study and work hard. I take a script and mull over it and underline the bits I want to emphasize. When I go on the set, I know exactly what I want to do and how I want to do it."         In 1949, Miss Lupino and Collier Young, a movie executive and producer who was then her husband, founded Filmakers, an independent production company, for which she directed candid films with feminist themes. One of the most popular was "The Bigamist" (1953).         The energetic Miss Lupino called directing the most demanding work in films, requiring tactful but firm handling of many temperaments and giving clear instructions to a usually all-male, often skeptical crew. Though she spent many hours at what was then a man's calling, she was unstintingly feminine in bearing and manner, observing, "I'm not the kind of woman who can bark orders."         Miss Lupino was petite, standing only 5 feet 2 inches tall and weighing 112 pounds. She had auburn hair and violet eyes framed by half-inch-long lashes. Her leisure pursuits included skin diving, writing short stories and children's books, and composing music. One work, "Aladdin Suite," was performed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra.         She was married to (and divorced from) the actor Louis Hayward (1938 to 1945) as well as Mr. Young (1948 to 1951). She and Howard Duff were married in 1951 and divorced in 1983. He died in 1990.         Miss Lupino is survived by a daughter, Bridget Duff, and a sister, Rita Lupino.       
         Annie Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, the younger of the two sisters whose wisdom and triumphs have been celebrated in a best-selling book and in the Broadway play "Having Our Say," died yesterday at her home in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. She was 104.         "She just took a couple of deep breaths and passed away," said Amy Hill Hearth, co-author of "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 years," the 1993 best-selling oral history. "And it's an important thing she died at home, in her bed, with her sister there. That's all she wanted."         Her 106-year-old sister, Sarah, known as Sadie, with whom she had lived for more than 100 years, seemed to handle her sister's death with the same strength that had carried her through a century.         "I'll just do the best I can," Sarah Delany told Ms. Hearth in an interview at her home. "I'll continue right on as if Bessie were here."         She added that for her sister, whose life was filled with many achievements, the last few years had been particularly special. "Bessie lived to be 104, and she lived her life the way she wanted to," she said. "And especially the last couple of years, she has been having a ball. Between the play and books, she has been having the time of her life. And she said you really couldn't ask for anything more."         The two sisters had lived so long and seen so much that to some it seemed they might live forever. Born a generation after the Civil War, they had triumphed over Jim Crow, worked in Harlem during its renaissance, borne witness to the feminist and civil rights movements and in recent years, become national celebrities.         Their award-winning memoir has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 19 months, sold more than 900,000 copies and been translated into four foreign languages. They were co-authors of a second book, "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom" (Kodansha America, 1994) which has sold 160,000 copies. And in April their Mt. Vernon parlor was re-created on Broadway, in a dramatization that earned three Tony nominations.         Bessie Delany often marveled that the nation would be interested in what two elderly black women had to say. She wanted her life seen not so much as a story of blacks or of women, but of America.         The sisters' lives remained simple despite their celebrity. They rose early to eat a breakfast of oatmeal, went to bed after watching the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour on a black-and-white television and had no telephone. They relied mostly on each other for comfort and company. In more than a century, they lived apart for only a few months. And Sarah Delany said many times that it was for her baby sister that she had lived so long.         Annie Elizabeth Delany was born on Sept. 3, 1891, in Raleigh, N.C., the third child of a former slave who became the country's first black Episcopal bishop. Raised on the campus of St. Augustine's College, she and her siblings were well-educated, nurtured and sheltered from the harsher edges of American racism.         But she and her sister often spoke of the first time they were told to go to the back of the trolley car. And they remembered how the staff at the drugstore refused to serve them. Still, Bessie Delany was undaunted. Known as the feistier of the sisters, she was once almost lynched for speaking rudely to a "rebby boy." And she often told tales of how as a child she would sneak a sip from the forbidden side of the water fountain. 'I'd just take a drink of the white water," she said. "It didn't taste any different."         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1911 and worked as a teacher in North Carolina and Georgia to earn the money she needed to continue her education. The few months in 1912 that she and Sadie taught in different parts of the South was the only time they did not live together.         In 1917, the two sisters made their way to New York City. Bessie had planned to become a doctor but ultimately decided to go to dental school. She graduated from Columbia University in 1923 and became the second black woman to work as a dentist in New York.         Known as "Dr. Bessie, Harlem's colored woman dentist," Dr. Delany socialized with Cab Calloway, W. E. B. Du Bois and the doyennes of the Harlem Renaissance. But she treated many of Harlem's poor, and in 27 years of practice never raised her rates. It was $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling, from 1923 until the day she retired, in 1950.         Like her sister Sarah, the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school, she never married or had children. They referred to themselves as "Negro maiden ladies" and lived together in a Harlem apartment, in a Bronx cottage and finally in the Mt. Vernon home they bought in 1957.         With the death of their youngest sister, Laura, in 1993, they were the last survivors among their parents' children. When asked in a 1993 interview if she could account for her and her sister's longevity, Dr. Delany replied, "Honey, we never married; we never had husbands to worry us to death." As for mortality, she said, "I haven't been afraid to live, and I won't be afraid to die."         Recently Dr. Delany had become more frail, Ms. Hearth said. And in the time the two women knew each other, she often spoke about death, though with characteristic sass and humor. "She was worried she was too mean to get into heaven," Ms. Hearth remembered, laughing.         A funeral service is to be held on Thursday at 10:30 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. And before the curtain rises on "Having Our Say" tonight, there will be a brief tribute at the Booth Theater.         In addition to her sister, Dr. Delany is survived by 14 nieces and nephews.       
         Anyone attending the inauguration this weekend of Ruth Simmons as Smith College's ninth president will be likely to note the presence of such luminaries as Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning author; Johnnetta Cole, the president of Spelman College; Cornel West, the scholar, and Henry Louis Gates, the writer and chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard.         But they might miss the people who Ruth Simmons believes are the most important -- those responsible for her becoming the first black president of one of the country's most elite women's colleges. They are her nine brothers and sisters: Elbert, Wilford, Atherine, Albert, Arnold, Nora, Clarence, Ozella and Azella. Her eighth-grade teacher, Modria Caraway. Her high school drama teacher, Vernell Lillie.         Her kindergarten teacher, Ida Mae Henderson, would like to be there, but at age 85, she is not strong enough to make the trip alone from Grapeland, Tex. "Miss Ida Mae," Dr. Simmons said. "I revere her."         Dr. Simmons, who is 50, is the great-great-granddaughter of slaves. She began her journey on a cotton farm in Grapeland, in East Texas. Her parents, the late Isaac and Fannie Stubblefield, were sharecroppers. Dr. Simmons was the youngest of 12 children -- two brothers are dead -- and was 7 when the family moved to a poor section of Houston. Her father went to work in a factory and eventually became pastor of the Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church. Her mother scrubbed floors for white families.         To Henry Louis Gates, the appointment of a black woman to the top job at Smith is "a major event in the history of American letters." Professor Gates, who regards Dr. Simmons as a mentor, said, "She's the Jackie Robinson of college presidents."         Ask Ruth Simmons how she did it, how she made her way from Grapeland to the provost's job at Spelman College to vice provost at Princeton University to the presidency of Smith, and she seems startled by the question. "I didn't make it happen," she said in an interview the other day in her wood-paneled office at Smith. "That's just the point."         It was her teachers at the segregated schools she attended, W. R. Banks Elementary in Grapeland and Phyllis Wheatley High in Houston, who made it happen, she said. "They thought I belonged in college," she said. "And they were convinced they would get me there. They protected me, especially after my mother died."         She was 15 when her mother lost her battle with kidney disease. "I had a remarkable mother," said Dr. Simmons, who is 50. "When she would do day's work, she would sometimes take me with her to white people's houses when I was a little girl. The thing I remember vividly is how good she was at what she did. She was very demanding in terms of her own work -- Do it well, do it thoroughly, whatever you do."         After graduation from high school, she went to Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, where she majored in Romance languages.         "Vernell Lillie wrote to Dillard, which is where she had gone, and asked them to provide a scholarship for me," Dr. Simmons said.         Ms. Lillie, a professor of African studies at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview: "She was brilliant. I was very fortunate to be a part of her life."         The scholarship did not cover everything. "I didn't have enough money to buy clothes," said Dr. Simmons, who was elegantly dressed the other morning in a long, dark-green pleated skirt and matching jacket, with a double strand of pearls and small gold hoop earrings. "And I'll never forget one of my teachers asked me to come over to her house, and she went to her closet and she took enough clothes out for me to go to college."         Her family pitched in, too. "My brothers and sisters would send me what they could," she said. "They were all starting families. Sometimes it would be $5, or $10."         Her brother Wilford Stubblefield, who is 16 years older, was working at an oil refinery in Houston as a janitor, the only job open to a black man at the refinery in those days.         "We all helped her -- probably not as much as we should have," Wilford said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Houston. "She was the second one that had gone off to college. Naturally, we were proud."         Another brother, Clarence Stubblefield, who is 54 and a high school basketball coach in Houston, had gone to Prairie View College in Texas on a basketball scholarship.         Dr. Simmons said: "I'm not the brightest person in my family. I was very lucky. I came along at the right time."         Growing up in the segregated South, she said, she had no specific ambition, only a hunger to learn. "One really didn't aspire to do professional things," she said. "I think my mother must have thought that eventually perhaps I would get enough education to be self-sustaining and to do something comfortable, perhaps housework."         Instead, she earned an undergraduate degree from Dillard, and master's and doctorate degrees in Romance languages at Harvard. She became an assistant professor of French, and later an assistant dean at the University of New Orleans.         In the meantime, at age 22, she married Norbert Simmons, a lawyer and businessman. They had a son, Khari, now 22 and a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and a daughter, Maya, 18, who plans to attend Spelman next year.         After the couple separated in the mid-1980's -- they were divorced in 1989 -- Dr. Simmons began her administrative rise at Princeton. She brought Ms. Morrison and Professor West to the Princeton faculty. She tried to persuade Professor Gates to join the faculty, too, he said.         There was one problem with Ms. Morrison's appointment: the faculty search committee wanted a resume. And Ms. Morrison, offended by the request, refused to submit one.         So Ruth Simmons wrote Toni Morrison's resume for her. "Here's my philosophy about life," said Dr. Simmons, who considers Ms. Morrison her best friend. "Don't dwell on insignificant things."         Ms. Morrison said in a telephone interview: "She's still a bit of a miracle as far as I'm concerned. She has an unusual combination of real politics and integrity, and this very keen sense of morals which does not interfere with her generosity and her wide spiritedness. She's extremely creative in terms of solving other people's problems. And she's a lot of fun."         For the 14-member presidential search committee at Smith, Dr. Simmons was the unanimous first choice. "We had a wish list of the qualities we wanted," said one member of the committee, Peter Rose, a sociology professor. "She seemed to fill them all. Race was not an issue."         Of Smith's 2,800 students, 86 are black. There are 15 black faculty members -- out of 300.         One goals, Dr. Simmons said, is to interest more black women in Smith. She hopes her presence will help. "If it's not a good place for African-American students," she said, "it's not a good place for me."         Her friend, Professor Gates, said he was already planning ahead. "I'm hoping Maggie and Liza Gates will go to Smith now," he said, referring to his teen-age daughters. "It never would have occurred to me before Ruth became president."         For now, her presence has electrified the campus. She walks everywhere. She invites students into her office to talk. She listens to them, they say.         Tigress Osborne, a black senior, said she returned to Smith last spring after taking some time off. "One of my friends said, 'You won't believe what's happened: we have a black president!' " Ms. Osborne said. "There's a moment when you think if Smith picked a black woman, how black is she? Is she going to be interested in us?"         She added, "But there's a real sense of her blackness. She also has a good handle on how to be not just the black president, on how not to cater to just black students."         Watching Dr. Simmons mingle at the senior tea last week, one senior, Kathryn Fields, who is white, said: "She's so cool. She's so young. She's new, she's exciting, she's going to make this school amazing."         At her inauguration, the new president will be carrying a Bible her mother gave her father on the day they were married.         "I know the board of trustees thinks I'm trying to live up to the standards they set for me, and that's O.K.," she said. But she is aiming toward the higher standard set for her by Fannie Stubblefield, who never had the chance to go beyond the seventh grade. "Every day that I'm here," Dr. Simmons said, "I try to be worthy of the kind of person my mother wanted me to be."       
         Lillian Nassau, the doyenne of New York antiques dealers and one of the first in America to see a market in Art Nouveau and Art Deco, died early yesterday at her home in New York. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Nassau held forth in a forest of Tiffany lamps in her two shops, first on Third Avenue and 56th Street and, from 1968 until her retirement in 1982, on East 57th Street. For more than 35 years, her galleries were gathering places for collectors and museum curators from around the world.         They came seeking the 20th-century decorative arts she stocked and the expertise she provided, both on the market and on the history of these objects. She was the first to handle the works of Louis Comfort Tiffany, and became his greatest champion in the revival that began in the mid-1950's and continues today. She paid $176 for her first leaded bronze-and-glass lamp by Tiffany in 1956; before her death Tiffany lamps were selling for more than $1 million.         She was also among the first to stock the works of the giants of early 20th-century European design: Rene Lalique's jewelry and glassware, Georg Jensen's silver, Emile Galle's vases and lamps and the furniture of Josef Hoffmann, Louis Majorelle and Carlo Bugatti.         In the 1970's Mrs. Nassau's clients included Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Barbra Streisand, Andy Warhol, Warner Leroy, all the Beatles and members of Led Zeppelin and Blood Sweat and Tears. Edgar J. Kaufmann Jr., the architectural historian, started collecting Tiffany flower-form vases there in the 1950's. And David Geffen bought most of his Tiffany lamps there in the 1970's, selling them in 1984 at Christie's in New York for two to five times what he had paid. Sydney and Frances Lewis of Richmond, who were Mrs. Nassau's customers from the 1960's until she retired, donated most of their Tiffany, Art Nouveau and Art Deco objects to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond..         And after Mrs. Nassau retired, no dealer took her place as the dominant merchant in the field. She remained a recognized authority, often consulted by curators and collectors.         Retirement was difficult for her at first, said her son, Paul, who took over the shop. "She wanted to keep running the business from home," he said. "But she was always available to talk, and until a few years ago, when she became ill, always gave me good advice."         Lillian Brinberg was born in Warsaw. She arrived with her family in New York when she was 2 years old. She attended public schools and went to Columbia University for a few years, hoping to become a newspaper reporter. Instead, she was married in 1920 to Harry Nassau; they were divorced in the late 1930's.         Mrs. Nassau became a dealer in 20th-century decorative arts in 1945, opening the shop on Third Avenue at 56th Street, her first. By then, she had spent a decade in the antiques business, buying and selling gold and jewelry door to door on Long Island, during the Depression. She also worked in a furniture store in Manhattan where she learned about antiques.         She often recalled that as she came into the business, dealers were taking unpopular Tiffany lamps and knocking out the glass flowers and trees, to sell the metal for junk. By the mid-1950's, the revival in Tiffany glass had begun, and Mrs. Nassau was in the vanguard of dealers handling this material.         Among her donations to institutions was a Tiffany mosaic mural that adds a glow to the courtyard of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She also gave the Metropolitan her favorite piece of jewelry, a glorious enameled necklace, made about 1900 by Lalique.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her husband Dr. Leo S. Palitz and a sister, Pauline Sorkin, all of New York; two grandchildren, and five great-grandsons.       
         Vera Maxwell, one of a legendary group of American sportswear designers who came to prominence in the 1940's, died on Sunday in Rincon, P.R., at the home of her grandson, Douglas Maxwell.         She was 93 and died after a brief illness, said her daughter-in-law, Rhea Maxwell.         One of the pioneers of women's sportswear along with Claire McCardell, Clare Potter, Carolyn Schnurer and Tina Leser, Vera Maxwell continued to design clothes that were casual, comfortable and classic until her retirement in 1985.         Among her innovations was the "weekend wardrobe" of 1935 that consisted of two jackets, two skirts and a pair of trousers; the wraparound jersey blouse; the riding jacket suit and the fencing suit. In the 1940's she designed a cotton coverall uniform for war workers at the Sperry Gyroscope Corporation that was a forerunner of the jump suit. She was also the first American designer to make clothes of Ultrasuede.         She won the Coty American Fashion Critics' Award in 1953 and was honored in 1970 with a retrospective exhibition at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington. In 1980 there was another retrospective, this time at the Museum of the City of New York, which opened with a party attended by Princess Grace of Monaco and her daughter Princess Caroline. Mrs. Maxwell had met the former Grace Kelly in Dallas in 1955 when they were both there to receive Neiman Marcus Awards, and she frequently visited her and Prince Rainier in Monaco.         Born Vera Huppe in New York City on April 22, 1901, of Viennese parents, she traveled to Europe with them as a child and lived for a while in Vienna. She attended high school in Leonia, N.J., and studied ballet in New York, becoming a member of the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1919. She danced with the company until her marriage in 1924 to Raymond J. Maxwell, who worked on Wall Street. They were divorced in 1937. She married Carlisle H. Johnson, an architect, in 1938 and divorced him in 1945.         While married to Mr. Maxwell, she had started to model on Seventh Avenue and developed an interest in making clothes. She studied tailoring in London and worked as a designer for several American sportswear houses including Adler and Adler, Glenhunt and Max Milstein. (In 1970, Mrs. Maxwell formed a business partnership with Mr. Milstein's nephew Morton Milstein.)         Mrs. Maxwell became known as a designer in the 1930's when American fashion was struggling to be born and most designers toiled anonymously. She achieved fame with such designs as a weekend wardrobe of a collarless jacket with four patch pockets that she made in tweed and in gray flannel to be mixed and matched with a short pleated flannel tennis skirt, a longer tweed skirt with pressed-down pleats and a pair of flannel cuffed trousers -- all designs so classic they could still be worn today.         Following the precepts of her idol, Coco Chanel, Mrs. Maxwell devoted herself to making timeless clothes that women could move around in. In 1975, she showed what she called a "speed suit," which was actually a pull-on dress with a stretch top and no zippers, buttons, snaps or ties. A woman could slip it on in seconds.         After years of designing for other manufacturers, Mrs. Maxwell founded her own company, Vera Maxwell Originals, in 1947. Her heyday was in the 1950's when her easy-to-wear styles attracted customers like Pat Nixon, Martha Graham and Lillian Gish. By 1960 her clothes were being sold in 700 stores around the country. In the 60's, her star waned as fashion's attention shifted to swinging London designers like Mary Quant and Zandra Rhodes.         In 1964, Mrs. Maxwell showed a collection of American Indian-inspired clothing that failed to find an audience. "It bombed," she said in an interview that appeared in The New York Times in 1970. "So I decided to lie fallow for a while."         She resurfaced in 1970 with a collection that was introduced at a tea in B. Altman's. Until her retirement, she continued to turn out the tasteful classic suits, coats and dresses that her loyal customers would wear for years.         She made a brief comeback as a consultant to a knitwear company but spent most of her time working on her memoirs. They have never been published, her daughter-in-law said, partly because "people wanted gossip about Grace Kelly, but she wouldn't write that."         She sold her Manhattan apartment three years ago and retired to Gilgo Beach, L.I., with her son, Dr. R. John Maxwell, and daughter-in-law and spent winters in Rincon with them and her grandson. She is also survived by her granddaughter, Sarah Maxwell of Santa Fe, N.M., and a great-granddaughter, Isabel Maxwell.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104.         Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.         "Mother passed away peacefully today," Senator Kennedy said last night. "She had a long and extraordinary life, and we loved her deeply. To all of us in the Kennedy and Fitzgerald families, she was the most beautiful rose of all."         President Clinton extended his condolences last night. "Very few Americans have endured as much personal sacrifice for their country as Rose Kennedy," the President said. "She played an extraordinary role in the life of an extraordinary family. Hillary and I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the Kennedy family."         Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.         In recent years, Mrs. Kennedy, a devout Roman Catholic who often said she drew on her faith to cope with sorrows, had remained out of the public eye that followed her nearly all her life. She spent her time reciting the rosary daily, attending Mass celebrated by a priest in her living room on Sundays and sitting on a porch overlooking Nantucket Sound on sunny weekends while her children and grandchildren paid visits and regaled her with their latest adventures.         They were the twilight years of a life she once described as a series of agonies and ecstasies, a life born into fortune and politics, wed to ambition, graced by the exhilaration of a son in the White House and others on Capitol Hill, but touched by violent death, illness, scandal and other adversities. Tragedy Intrudes On a Privileged Life         Raised in Boston, the daughter of John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor and Massachusetts Congressman, the young Rose Fitzgerald knew a life most only dream of -- private schools, debutante balls, summers on Cape Cod, winters in Palm Beach, trips to Europe and Asia, and hosts of suitors entranced by her young Irish charm and directness.         She was married at 24 to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the son of a saloon keeper, and a dynamo who amassed holdings in banking, real estate, liquor, films and Wall Street that grew to an estimated $500 million. Despite controversy over his wealth and isolationist views, he was posted to the Court of St. James's as Ambassador to Britain from 1938 to 1941.         There were meetings with kings, presidents and popes, and the satisfaction of children on the national stage, in Congress and in the White House. Although hers was a supporting role, her erect bearing, careful grooming and tireless work in her sons' campaigns, made her a figure of public interest in her own right.         She was not a powerful public speaker, but family members called her expert at gauging her audiences. On a single evening, they said, she could don a head scarf and mingle with workmen's wives at a stop in a blue-collar neighborhood, then rush off to campaign at a country club, changing in the back seat of a car into a mink coat and stylish shoes. It was a whirl that led to many successes.         But sorrow intruded time and again. Four of her nine children died in their prime. President Kennedy was slain by an assassin in Dallas in 1963. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot by another assassin in Los Angeles during the 1968 Presidential campaign. Her eldest son, Joseph Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed when his plane exploded over the English Channel on a mission in World War II. And a daughter, Kathleen, died in a plane crash in 1948.         Her eldest daughter, Rosemary, was diagnosed as mentally retarded and has lived in a nursing home for 40 years. In 1969, a car driven by Senator Edward Kennedy ran off a bridge on Martha's Vineyard and a young aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, was killed. Later that year, Mrs. Kennedy's husband, who had suffered a stroke in 1961 that left him an invalid, also died.         For Mrs. Kennedy, who had 30 grandchildren and 41 great-grandchildren, the sorrows continued in recent years. A grandson, David, the son of Robert, was found dead in a Florida hotel room in 1985, the victim, officials said, of an apparent overdose of cocaine and Demerol. And Mrs. Kennedy's former daughter-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died of cancer last May.         Four years ago, at celebrations marking her 100th birthday, Senator Kennedy, her last surviving son, told 400 family members and friends, "In the chaos of our household, she was the quiet at the center of the storm, the anchor of our family, the safe harbor to which we always came."         There were many books that explored the Kennedys and their conduct, and most touched on Rose Kennedy. "J.F.K.: Reckless Youth," by Nigel Hamilton (Random House, 1992), called the President's mother a chilly, remote woman, obsessed with religion, personal hygiene and designer clothing, and incapable of giving her children the affection they craved.         The assertions prompted a blistering response, published on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, by four of her children: Senator Kennedy, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Patricia Kennedy Lawford and Jean Kennedy Smith. "We categorically reject the misjudgments, mischaracterizations, insinuations and outright falsehoods about our family relationships portrayed in the book," they wrote.         "Our parents gave us love, support and encouragement throughout their lives. Contrary to the malicious portrayal in this book, they were devoted and caring parents who lavished affection and attention on all of us."         "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys," by Doris Kearns (Simon & Schuster, 1987), also said that Rose and Joseph Kennedy were less than ideal parents, that Mrs. Kennedy eventually became the more remote and even withdrew from her husband into the isolated comfort of her religion, because of "the complicatedly intense relationship she had experienced with her father so many years before."         In her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974), Mrs. Kennedy said that she had devoted herself to her children and that there had been many satisfactions in her role. "What greater aspiration and challenge are there for a mother than the hope of raising a great son or daughter?" she wrote, and called motherhood "a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession." Early Introduction To Political Life         Rose Fitzgerald was born in Boston on July 22, 1890, the oldest of six children of an exuberant politician and his wife, the former Josephine Mary Hannon. After serving in the Massachusetts Legislature and the United States House of Representatives, her father became Mayor of Boston in 1906.         Her mother was a quiet woman who disliked the limelight, and Rose tasted politics early, parading through the streets with her father and attending public gatherings where the beer and the blarney flowed like the lilt of brogue. He introduced her to Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, and to his wealthy, influential friends.         She graduated with honors from Dorchester High School at 15, and wanted to enter Wellesley College, but her parents thought she was too young and enrolled her at the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart in Purchase, N.Y. She was also sent to Blumenthal Academy, a finishing school run by German nuns, in the Netherlands, where girls majored in French and German.         The Irish were still being snubbed by the Boston Brahmins in those days, and despite her stylish education and attractive, self-assured manner, she was blackballed from the Junior League. She shrugged off the slight and formed her own group, the Ace of Clubs.         There were many suitors, including Sir Thomas Lipton, a tea merchant and yachtsman. But she chose Joseph Kennedy, a political lieutenant of her father. Mr. Fitzgerald did not particularly like Mr. Kennedy. He was too brash and early in the courtship, was made unwelcome in the Fitzgerald house.         But he proposed on the sidewalk outside, and Rose made it clear that she was going to marry him, with or without her father's permission. Mr. Fitzgerald grudgingly blessed the marriage, which took place on Oct. 7, 1914. Soon, Mr. Kennedy gained control of the Columbia Trust Company in Boston and, at 25, became the youngest bank president in the country.         Moving into real estate and liquor interests, he also made fortunes on Wall Street and in Hollywood films. And there were many rumors of infidelity with socialites and movie stars, notably the actress Gloria Swanson.         Meantime, his wife stayed home on Beale Street in Brookline, near Boston, giving birth to and raising her children. Joseph Jr. was born in 1915, followed by John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean and Edward.         In 1938, Mrs. Kennedy accompanied her husband to the Court of St. James's and was formally welcomed by King George VI. By 1941, the Kennedys were back in the United States.         Mrs. Kennedy took Rosemary, then 22, to several specialists to determine why she had been "slow" since birth. The diagnosis was mental retardation. She was placed in a home in Wisconsin, where she still lives. According to Ms. Kearns's book, she was also given a lobotomy upon orders of her father. Three years later, Mrs. Kennedy's oldest son, Joseph Jr., was killed in the war.         After the war, as John's political career began, Mrs. Kennedy took to the campaign trail with extraordinary zest and considerable effectiveness, speaking at women's functions and shaking hands and chatting at rallies and other functions.         Acquaintances recalled that she was remarkably frank in her conversations with voters and reporters, sometimes even embarrassingly so. Once when there were complaints that large amounts of Kennedy money were being spent on a race, she told a reporter, "It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please." An Inauguration Of a Son         The high point of her life, perhaps, was the inauguration of her son John as the 35th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 1961. The gown she wore to his Inaugural Ball was the one she wore when she was introduced to King George VI 20 years earlier.         Her son Robert was appointed Attorney General, and Edward was elected to fill John's unexpired Senate term. Mrs. Kennedy continued to travel widely, appearing with her sons. Her other children were not in the center of public life, although Eunice married Sargent Shriver, who became director of the Peace Corps and the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee in 1972, Jean was named the Ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton, and Patricia married the actor Peter Lawford, who died in 1984.         Her grandchildren include the son and daughter of President Kennedy, John F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who has been active in family interests, including the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. Another grandchild, William Kennedy Smith, was in the news in 1991 when a Florida woman accused him of rape at the Kennedy estate in Palm Beach; he was later acquitted.         Several of her grandchildren have followed the family tradition of entering politics. Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Robert's oldest son, became a United States representative from Massachusetts in 1986, replacing the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill, who retired.         Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Robert's oldest child, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 1994; Patrick Kennedy, one of Edward's sons, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1994 after serving as a Rhode Island state legislator. And Mark Shriver, the son of Eunice, was elected in 1994 to the Maryland House of Delegates.         In 1985, the City of Boston dedicated a one-acre rose garden to Mrs. Kennedy. "I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world," she told an interviewer. "Even though my life has been scarred by tragedy, I have never lost this feeling. God has held us all in his hand."       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass.

She graduated with honors from Dorchester High School at 15, and wanted to enter Wellesley College, but her parents thought she was too young and enrolled her at the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart in Purchase, N.Y. She was also sent to Blumenthal Academy, a finishing school run by German nuns, in the Netherlands, where girls majored in French and German.         The Irish were still being snubbed by the Boston Brahmins in those days, and despite her stylish education and attractive, self-assured manner, she was blackballed from the Junior League. She shrugged off the slight and formed her own group, the Ace of Clubs.         There were many suitors, including Sir Thomas Lipton, a tea merchant and yachtsman. But she chose Joseph Kennedy, a political lieutenant of her father. Mr. Fitzgerald did not particularly like Mr. Kennedy. He was too brash and early in the courtship, was made unwelcome in the Fitzgerald house.         But he proposed on the sidewalk outside, and Rose made it clear that she was going to marry him, with or without her father's permission. Mr. Fitzgerald grudgingly blessed the marriage, which took place on Oct. 7, 1914. Soon, Mr. Kennedy gained control of the Columbia Trust Company in Boston and, at 25, became the youngest bank president in the country.         Moving into real estate and liquor interests, he also made fortunes on Wall Street and in Hollywood films. And there were many rumors of infidelity with socialites and movie stars, notably the actress Gloria Swanson.         Meantime, his wife stayed home on Beale Street in Brookline, near Boston, giving birth to and raising her children. Joseph Jr. was born in 1915, followed by John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean and Edward.         In 1938, Mrs. Kennedy accompanied her husband to the Court of St. James's and was formally welcomed by King George VI. By 1941, the Kennedys were back in the United States.         Mrs. Kennedy took Rosemary, then 22, to several specialists to determine why she had been "slow" since birth. The diagnosis was mental retardation. She was placed in a home in Wisconsin, where she still lives. According to Ms. Kearns's book, she was also given a lobotomy upon orders of her father. Three years later, Mrs. Kennedy's oldest son, Joseph Jr., was killed in the war.         After the war, as John's political career began, Mrs. Kennedy took to the campaign trail with extraordinary zest and considerable effectiveness, speaking at women's functions and shaking hands and chatting at rallies and other functions.         Acquaintances recalled that she was remarkably frank in her conversations with voters and reporters, sometimes even embarrassingly so. Once when there were complaints that large amounts of Kennedy money were being spent on a race, she told a reporter, "It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please."         An Inauguration Of a Son         The high point of her life, perhaps, was the inauguration of her son John as the 35th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 1961. The gown she wore to his Inaugural Ball was the one she wore when she was introduced to King George VI 20 years earlier.         Her son Robert was appointed Attorney General, and Edward was elected to fill John's unexpired Senate term. Mrs. Kennedy continued to travel widely, appearing with her sons. Her other children were not in the center of public life, although Eunice married Sargent Shriver, who became director of the Peace Corps and the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee in 1972, Jean was named the Ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton, and Patricia married the actor Peter Lawford, who died in 1984.         Her grandchildren include the son and daughter of President Kennedy, John F.  Kennedy Jr., a lawyer, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who has been active in family interests, including the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. Another grandchild, William Kennedy Smith, was in the news in 1991 when a Florida woman accused him of rape at the Kennedy estate in Palm Beach; he was later acquitted.         Several of her grandchildren have followed the family tradition of entering politics. Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Robert's oldest son, became a United States representative from Massachusetts in 1986, replacing the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill, who retired.         Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Robert's oldest child, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 1994; Patrick Kennedy, one of Edward's sons, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1994 after serving as a Rhode Island state legislator. And Mark Shriver, the son of Eunice, was elected in 1994 to the Maryland House of Delegates.         In 1985, the City of Boston dedicated a one-acre rose garden to Mrs. Kennedy. "I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world," she told an interviewer. "Even though my life has been scarred by tragedy, I have never lost this feeling. God has held us all in his hand."         Correction:  March 17, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Jan. 23 of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy misstated both the name and the location of the school from which she graduated in 1910. At that time, it was known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart, not Manhattanville College, and it was located in Manhattanville, N.Y., not Purchase. A recent letter from a reader pointed out the error.       
         Ginger Rogers, the vivacious actress whose supple grace in the arms of Fred Astaire lifted the spirits of Depression-era moviegoers in some of the most elegantly romantic musical films ever made, died yesterday at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 83.         The blond, blue-eyed actress, who came out of Charleston contests and the vaudeville circuits to win notice as a cherub-faced flapper with a piping voice and a sassy air in early musicals like "42d Street" and "Gold Diggers of 1933," went on to win acclaim for her dramatic portrayals and an Academy Award for best actress for her depiction of a lovelorn career woman in the 1940 film "Kitty Foyle."         The potent chemistry of her partnership with Astaire, in a succession of urbane romances that featured rapturous dance routines, propelled her into the top 10 of Hollywood's box-office attractions. "He gives her class, and she gives him sex," Katharine Hepburn once said. By 1941, Ginger Rogers was the highest-paid American woman, earning $355,000 a year.         While her graceful dancing was on display in her many musicals, Miss Rogers also won renown in dramatic roles including an aspiring actress in "Stage Door" (1937) and a prostitute's daughter in "Primrose Path" (1940). Her gift for comedy bubbled through movies like "Bachelor Mother" (1939), "Tom, Dick and Harry" (1941) and "The Major and the Minor" (1942). In a screen career that began with a bit role in "Young Man of Manhattan" in 1930, she made more than 70 movies.         But the Astaire-Rogers musicals, epitomizing grace, energy and sophistication, were her enduring memorial. The couple, in their smooth, seemingly effortless style, spun gossamer fantasies from the infectious scores of Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Vincent Youmans.         Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, said yesterday: "Ginger Rogers was a better dancer than most people gave her credit for. She may have swooped and dipped into many a romantic swoon, but her footwork was as precise as Astaire's."         The plots of their films often turned on mistaken identity and other far-fetched devices, but they were accepted as breathing spaces between the couple's champagne dance numbers in lavish settings where all the walls, telephones and pianos were white, the butlers were always comic and love was the only concern.         Under Astaire's painstaking coaching, Miss Rogers's dancing became more fluid with each film, and the consensus was that none of his later partnerships generated the electricity they did.         Writing in 1972, the dance critic Arlene Croce said Miss Rogers "danced with love, with pride in the beauty of an illusion -- and with one of the most elegant dancer's bodies imaginable." She added, "She avoided any suggestion of toil or inadequacy."         When the actress went to the stage of the Biltmore Bowl in the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles to accept her Oscar on Feb. 27, 1941, she stood with tears streaming down her face and said: "This is the greatest moment of my life. I want to thank the one who has stood by me faithfully: my mother."         It was her mother, the former Lela Owens, who groomed her for a show-business career with singing, dancing and acting lessons. Miss Rogers, whose given name was Virginia Katherine McMath, was born on July 16, 1911, in Independence, Mo. Her father, William McMath, and her mother were divorced soon after. Their daughter was called Ginger because a cousin could not pronounce Virginia, and she took her later surname from John Rogers, who was briefly her stepfather. She grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and Fort Worth. Her mother continued to manage her career until she died in 1977.         At 15, Miss Rogers became the champion Charleston dancer in Texas. Then, for three years, her mother chaperoned her through four vaudeville acts a day throughout the South and Midwest. "I traveled with my mother, Lela, and there was never enough money," Miss Rogers said. "I always had to roll down my silk stockings and carry a doll when we bought train tickets so I could go half-fare. If we had $3, we always figured how to tip for the trunks and still eat." She played Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago. When Miss Rogers was 18, they went to New York, where she sang with two bands and in a musical and starred in the Gershwins' 1930 Broadway hit "Girl Crazy," introducing the songs "But Not for Me" and "Embraceable You."         At 19, she made her first feature film in New York, "Young Man of Manhattan," uttering a memorable instruction: "Cigarette me, big boy." In her third musical film, "42d Street," she was a risque, wisecracking chorine, Anytime Annie. "The only time she said no," a fellow actor quipped, "she didn't hear the question."         Her big break came when she was 22, when she and Mr. Astaire won supporting roles in "Flying Down to Rio." Their rollicking introduction of a dance called the Carioca stole the show from its nominal stars, Dolores Del Rio and Gene Raymond.         Over the next six years they were teamed in eight more movies and introduced a glittering array of now-standard songs and dances, among them "Night and Day" and "The Continental" from "The Gay Divorcee," "I Won't Dance" from "Roberta," "Cheek to Cheek" from "Top Hat," "Let's Face the Music and Dance" from "Follow the Fleet," "Never Gonna Dance" from "Swing Time" and "They All Laughed" from "Shall We Dance."         Years later, she wrote about their partnership, emphasizing that Astaire was no Svengali. By the time they joined forces in "Flying Down to Rio" in 1933, she pointed out, she had made 20 films, he only one. She acknowledged that they had "occasional snits," but, she said: "We had fun, and it shows. True, we were never bosom buddies off the screen; we were different people with different interests. We were a couple only on film."         And, she noted: "I'd do three or four pictures between those I made with Fred. We weren't Siamese twins. I always wanted to stretch out and do some things as me, alone, by myself. I did, and among the things was 'Kitty Foyle.' "         Miss Rogers's later films included an elaborate fantasy, "Lady in the Dark" (1944); a wartime romance, "I'll Be Seeing You" (1945); the comedies "Dreamboat" (1952), "Monkey Business" (1952) and "Forever Female" (1954), and melodramas like "Tight Spot" (1955) and "Harlow" (1965). Reviewers attributed her enduring success to a dualistic personality -- tough versus vulnerable, ingenuous versus calculating -- and to a talent for mimicry and pretense.         In 1951, Miss Rogers won wide praise in a Broadway comedy, "Love and Let Love," although reviewers panned the play. Typically, she concluded, "We could have gone on touring around the country, probably playing to packed houses and getting our money back, but I'd rather be a sitting duck in a big pond."         In later musical triumphs, she succeeded Carol Channing in the title role of "Hello, Dolly!" on Broadway in 1965 and played the role to ovations for more than two years. In 1969, she introduced "Mame" to London audiences. Gower Champion, who directed her in "Dolly," hailed her "drive, verve, spark and talent."         Miss Rogers liked to keep busy. She often worked in summer stock, appearing in productions of musicals like "Annie Get Your Gun" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" and in comedies like "Tovarich" and "Bell, Book and Candle." In the 1970's she developed a successful nightclub act, and she was also a fashion consultant to the J. C. Penney chain.         In her last film, in 1965, she played Jean Harlow's mother in "Harlow." By then, she was unhappy with the frankness of Hollywood films. Looking back, she said, "We made happy pictures that people enjoyed seeing, not the kind the audiences have to go through trauma to see nowadays."         Miss Rogers's autobiography, "Ginger: My Story," was published by HarperCollins in 1991. John Mueller, in The New York Times Book Review, found Miss Rogers's book short on insight and discreet to the point that "one does not get a terribly rich feel for her personality." In discussing her career, he continued, "she is far more likely to tell us what she wore than what she did."         Miss Rogers was a Christian Scientist who never smoked or drank alcohol, except for an occasional glass of wine at supper. She loved the outdoors and exercised regularly. When her schedule allowed, she swam every day and played golf and tennis several times a week. She ate moderately and maintained a trim figure in middle age, giving this advice: "I try to feed my hunger rather than my appetite."         In 1938, she built a mountaintop mansion in Beverly Hills with a large swimming pool, a tennis court and an elaborate soda fountain. She also bought a big dairy and multi-crop ranch on the Rogue River near Medford, Ore., which eventually became her main home.         The actress was married five times: to Edward Culpepper, a dancer and actor known in vaudeville as Jack Pepper (1928 to 1931); the actor Lew Ayres (1934 to 1940); Jack Briggs, another actor (1943 to 1949); Jacques Bergerac, a French actor and businessman (1953 to 1957), and William Marshall, a director and producer (1961-1967). All five marriages ended in divorce. "I yearned for a long, happy marriage with one person," she wrote. But, she said, her life had been blessed in other ways, and in 1987 she said she didn't mind being alone. "It'd be fun to have a chum around, but it's very had to have a chum unless you're married to him," she said. "And I don't believe in today's concept for living with someone unmarried."         In 1992, Miss Rogers was one of the recipients of the 15th annual Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievement.         Asked by one interviewer what personal quality she was proudest of, Miss Rogers replied: "The most important thing in anyone's life is to be giving something. The quality I can give is fun and joy and happiness. This is my gift." Ever a Trouper Through the Decades         In more than six decades in show business, Ginger Rogers appeared in some 70 films, as well as in vaudeville, theater and television.
