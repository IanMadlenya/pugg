         Amelia Opdyke Jones, an artist who made the "Subway Sun" posters for the New York City Transit Authority for 20 years, died on Thursday at her home in Sea Girt, N.J. She was 80.         The cause was respiratory complications, said her son, William.         Mrs. Jones's drawings, which she signed "Oppy," were first published in Life magazine in the 1930's. She also drew a syndicated comic strip, "The Young Idear.         The "Subway Sun" posters, which appeared in subway cars and buses in New York City in the 1940's and 50's, portrayed places of interest and promoted good behavior by users of the transit system.         Mrs. Jones's husband, William J. Jones, died in 1965.         In addition to her son, of Sea Girt, she is survived by a daughter, Margaretta J. Friday of Weston, Conn., four grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Dixy Lee Ray, former chairwoman of the Atomic Energy Commission and Governor of Washington, died yesterday at her home on Fox Island, near Tacoma. She was 79.         She had suffered for some months from a severe bronchial condition, said a friend, Lou Guzzo, who is a television commentator.         Dr. Ray, a marine biologist who championed the nuclear industry, was appointed by President Richard M. Nixon to the atomic commission in 1972, and served as chairwoman from 1973 to 1975. During her tenure, she raised eyebrows in the nation's capital by living in a mobile home and taking her dogs to the office.         In 1974, she underscored the finding of an Atomic Energy Commission study of nuclear power plant safety: that the chance of mass destruction from a reactor accident was as unlikely as that of a meteor striking an urban area. "There is no question that the nuclear industry comes off very well," she said.         She issued her latest no-nonsense commentary on nuclear issues on Thursday, when she dismissed reports about cold-war-era Federal radiation experiments as alarmist.         "Everybody is exposed to radiation," Dr. Ray was quoted by The Associated Press as saying, adding, "A little bit more or a little bit less is of no consequence." Criticizing Kissinger         The Atomic Energy Commission was eventually abolished and its duties were transferred to the new Energy Research and Development Administration. Dr. Ray was appointed by President Gerald R. Ford in 1975 as Assistant Secretary of State for Oceans, International Environment and Scientific Affairs.         She resigned from the post later that year, contending that Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger had ignored her office on policy matters.         It was as a Democrat that Dr. Ray was elected in 1976 to one term as the only female Governor her state has had, becoming the nation's second woman to be elected Governor without succeeding her husband. Ella T. Grasso, a Democrat, had been elected Governor of Connecticut two years before.         Dr. Ray, after her surprise victory, said that she supported the Equal Rights Amendment but that women should "stop brooding about being a woman." She told women, "If you want to do something, then train yourself and you've got to be willing to work."         Governor Ray a conservative in fiscal matters and was praised by a lobbyist in the aircraft industry as "the best friend business ever had."         She also angered environmentalists with her support of nuclear power, unhampered growth and oil supertankers.         But she could also be stern in the environmental sphere. In 1979, she ordered the low-level nuclear waste dump at a Federal reservation in Hanford, Wash., one of only three in the nation, closed temporarily after inspectors had found that some radioactive material was being hauled in unsafe trucks.         In 1980, Dr. Ray herself faced a environmental problem when Mount St. Helens repeatedly erupted, ravaging parts of the state with volcanic mud flows, flooding and ash.         While Dr. Ray was Governor, the power of her intellect and her skill as a speaker gave her an aura of great competence. But she was sharp-tongued, highly unconventional for a politician in high office, and became entangled in disputes with reporters and with other public officials.         Dr. Ray was also burdened by disaffection in her own party going into the 1980 Democratic primary and suffered a startling defeat at the hands of State Senator Jim McDermott, who offered himself as "a Governor who listens."         She was christened Margaret at her birth in 1914 in Tacoma, but she later chose the name Dixy Lee. She climbed Mount Rainier, her state's tallest peak, at age 12 -- becoming the youngest girl to do so -- and went on to graduate in 1937 from Mills College, where she also earned a master's degree. She received a doctorate in zoology from Stanford in 1945.         She taught at schools in Oakland, Calif., from 1938 to 1942 and was an associate professor of zoology at the University of Washington from 1945 to 1976.         With Mr. Guzzo she wrote two books: "Trashing the Planet: How Science Can Help Us Deal With Acid Rain, Depletion of the Ozone, and Nuclear Waste (Among Other Things)," published in 1990, and "Environmental Overkill," published this year.         She is survived by her sisters, Marion Reid of Fox Island, Dr. Jean Ray of Long Beach, Calif., Julianna Strong of Salem, Ore., and Elvista Steele of Klatskanie, Ore.       
         Rosemary Glyde, a violist who performed frequently as a recitalist and was a founder and president of the New York Viola Society, died on Tuesday at the Northern Westchester Medical Center in Mount Kisco. She was 46 and lived in Golden's Bridge, N.Y.         The cause was cancer, said Joan Ryan, her publicity agent.         Ms. Glyde was born in Auburn, Ala., and studied with Lillian Fuchs and Dorothy Delay at the Juilliard School, where she received a doctorate. She made her New York debut in 1973, after winning first prize in the Juilliard Viola Competition.         Ms. Glyde devoted considerable energy to expanding the comparatively small repertory for solo viola. She transcribed the Bach Cello Suites and the Rachmaninoff Cello Sonata for her instrument, and she composed several works, including a Fantasia for Solo Viola and a Suite for Four Violas. Her repertory also included many contemporary works, and she gave the premieres of works composed for her by Richard Lane, Bernard Hoffer and Judith Shatin.         She is survived by her husband, William Salchow, and a daughter, Allison Shumsky, both of Golden's Bridge, and two sisters, Rosemary Glyde of Boulder, Colo., and Wendy Klopfenstein of Mobile, Ala.         Correction:  January 22, 1994, Saturday         An obituary on Thursday about Rosemary Glyde, a violist and composer, misstated the given name of a surviving sister. She is Judith Glyde.       
         Nancy Carnegie Rockefeller, a community leader and active volunteer in Greenwich, Conn., died at her home there yesterday. She was 93.         Family members said she died of natural causes.         An early champion of birth control, she helped establish the Greenwich Maternal Health Center in 1935. In recent years she had been concerned with the housing and care of the elderly in Greenwich and was a founder of the Merry-Go-Round, a center for the elderly, and the Mews, a residential hotel for older people.         She also was a president of the Hortulus Garden Club and a chairwoman of the Red Cross Gray Ladies. She received many awards, including Nutmegger of the Decade and a distinguished alumna award from the Foxcroft School.         Mrs. Rockefeller was the grandniece of Andrew Carnegie. Her husband, James Stillman Rockefeller, is a former president and chairman of Citibank and is a grandnephew of John D. Rockefeller.         She is also survived by two sons, James S. Jr. of Camden, Me., and Andrew C. of Greenwich; two daughters, Nancy Coop of Germantown, Tenn., and Georgia Rose of Manhattan; 14 grandchildren, and 24 great-grandchildren.       
         Susan Lehman Cullman, a New York philanthropist who served as a Navy cryptographer in World War II, died on Sunday at her home in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y. She was 79 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cullman graduated from Horace Mann School in 1932, then attended Vassar College for two years and graduated from New York University in 1962. During the war, she worked in the office of Adm. Thomas A. Hart as a decoder of Japanese messages. For many years, she edited the Cipher Exchange for Cryptogram Magazine.         Mrs. Cullman was the grandniece of the late Herbert H. Lehman, former New York State Governor and Senator, and a grandniece of Irving Lehman, former Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals. She was the granddaughter of Sigmund Lehman, the eldest of the founders of Lehman Brothers Investment Bankers early in the century. Her parents were Harold and Cecile Seligman Lehman. Her father was a partner in Lehman Brothers. Her stepfather was Dr. Edgar Meyer.         Mrs. Cullman is survived by her daughter, Dorothy Cullman Treisman of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a sister, Betty Asiel of White Plains, and two grandsons. Her former husband is Joseph F. Cullman 3d of Manhattan.         A memorial service is scheduled for Jan. 22 at 11 A.M. at the Ethical Culture Society, 2 West 64th Street at Central Park West.       
         Lynne Murray Johnson, the wife of Belton Kleberg Johnson, an heir to the King Ranch in Kingsville, Tex., died on Sunday at her home in San Antonio. She was 50.         The cause was cancer, said Janette Ganster, a spokeswoman for the Johnson family.         Mrs. Johnson was born in Narromine, Australia, and moved to Mexico, where she was married to Ricardo Penafiel, an industrialist, who is deceased. She moved to San Antonio in the mid-1980's and married Mr. Johnson in 1990.         She is survived by her husband; her mother, Sadie Murray, and her brother, Paul Murray, both of Newport Beach, Australia.       
         Phyllis Goodhart Gordan, a benefactor and former trustee of the New York Public Library, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said Lucy Rastelli, a daughter.         Mrs. Gordan's association with the library dated to 1940, when her husband, John D. Gordan, joined its staff and became curator of its Berg Collection of English and American literature. After his death in 1968 she was appointed to the committee on research libraries and later was its chairwoman. She was a library trustee from 1974 until 1985.         She is survived by three daughters, Mrs. Rastelli of Rome, Marjorie Bowden of London and Virginia Gordan of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, John D. Gordan 3d of Manhattan, and seven grandchildren.       
         Mary Moorman, a noted biographer of the English poet William Wordsworth, died on Jan. 21, The Times of London reported. She was 88 and lived in Durham, England.         Mrs. Moorman's biography of Wordsworth, an early leader of Romanticism who lived from 1770 to 1850, appeared in two volumes, published in 1957 and 1965. "William Wordsworth: A Biography" came to be considered the standard account of the poet's life. It has won praise from critics as solid, shapely, durable, extremely thorough and warmed by its author's affection for the poet's countryside.         Mrs. Moorman was also the editor of "The Journals of Dorothy Wordsworth" -- the poet's eloquent sister -- which first appeared in 1971 and is still in print in the United States from Oxford University Press. Her other works include a 1980 memoir about her father and "William III and the Defense of Holland, 1672-73 (1930).         Mrs. Moorman was the daughter of the historian George Macaulay Trevelyan, who died in 1962. She was educated at Berkhamsted School and at Somerville College at Oxford University.         Her husband, the Right Reverend J. R. H. Moorman, an ecclesiastical historian who retired in 1975 as the Anglican Bishop of Ripon, died in 1989 after 59 years of marriage.       
         Mildred Gilman Wohlforth, who wrote books and magazine articles and was a New York newspaperwoman during the Roaring Twenties, died on Monday at her home in Ridgefield, Conn. She was 97.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Robert M. Wohlforth.         Mrs. Wohlforth's breathless coverage of flappers, bootleggers, love nests and trunk murders earned her a reputation as one of journalism's first sob sisters.         She was a friend and confidante of Harold Ross, the first editor of The New Yorker magazine, and she knew Dorothy Parker, Robert Benchley, Christopher Morley and other members of what came to be known as the Algonquin Round Table.         Among the dozens of murders that Mrs. Wohlforth covered for The New York Journal was the notorious Triple X murder case, which involved a serial killer who preyed on couples in lovers' lanes.         Her first novel, "Fig Leaves," was published shortly after she graduated from the University of Wisconsin in 1919. Mrs. Wohlforth later became secretary to the columnist and author Heywood Broun and wrote a second novel, "Headlines."         Her articles appeared in Redbook, American Mercury, Reader's Digest, and McCall's. In 1931 Hollywood made a film of her third book, "Sob Sister," which she defined as "a reporter who almost literally sobbed with the victim, the culprit, the families of both."         She is survived by her husband of 63 years; two sons, Eric E., of Anchorage, and Timothy A., of Oakland, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Natalie Molostwoff, a former executive director of the School of American Ballet, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         The cause was cancer, said Nathalie Gleboff, the current executive director of the school, which is affiliated with the New York City Ballet.         Ms. Molostwoff, whose original name was Natalie Merimanova, was a native of Baku, Azerbaijan, and emigrated to New York City with her mother when she was a girl. In later years, she became a secretary and was hired by the School of American Ballet in 1938.         Eugenie Ouroussow, the school's director at the time, soon discovered that Ms. Molostwoff possessed administrative skills. She became Ms. Ouroussow's assistant. When Ms. Ouroussow died in 1976, Ms. Molostwoff succeeded her as executive director, holding that post until she retired in 1991.         Ms. Molostwoff's first marriage ended in divorce, but she continued to use her married surname professionally.         She is survived by her second husband, the choreographer John Taras.       
         Sonny Sloan, a driving force behind several philanthropic programs at the New York Public Library, died on Saturday at New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68.         The cause was cancer, said her former husband, Howard Sloan.         A lifelong resident of Manhattan, Mrs. Sloan was a trustee of the New York Public Library. She started the library's Adopt-a-School program, which sends library volunteers into public elementary schools. She was also instrumental in starting the annual library luncheon, in 1981, and an advisory committee of people from the publishing industry.         She was born Irvil June Lawson in Manhattan. After graduating from Colby Junior College, she opened an art gallery in Manhattan, the Barone Gallery. When Mrs. Sloan retired from her gallery work in the 1960's, she started her philanthropic work for the library.         Mrs. Sloan was chairwoman of the library volunteers from 1984 until 1988, and was co-chairwoman of the library's council of conservators. She was also a board member of the Citizens Committee for Children and the Dance Theater Foundation at New York City Center.         She is survived by her mother, Florence Lawson of Florida; a brother, Thomas Lawson of Sandy Hook, Conn.; three children, Douglas Sloan of Manhattan, Kathryn Roth of Weston, Mass., and Gillis Bolton of Roxbury, Conn., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  January 11, 1994, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about a trustee of the New York Public Library who died on Saturday misspelled her first name in some copies. She was Sonny Sloan, not Sunny.       
         Emily Jordan Boxer, a television producer who arranged book interviews for NBC television's "Today" show in the 1980's, died yesterday at New York Hospital. A resident of Manhattan and Amagansett, L.I., she was 65.         The cause was massive pneumonia, said her husband, John Boxer.         A native of Brooklyn, she was a graduate of Brooklyn College. She started her career in 1953 with Walt Framer Productions, working on such shows as "The Price Is Right."         From 1979 to 1991 she was book coordinator at the "Today" show. She selected and scheduled authors and other literary figures, briefed NBC anchors and correspondents and wrote questions they asked the guests.         After that, until last February, she was the special-features producer for "The Home Show" on ABC.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Boxer is survived by two sons, Adam, of Brooklyn and Nicholas, of Atlanta, and two grandchildren.       
         Emily Taft Douglas, a former United States Representative from Illinois, died on Friday at a nursing home in White Plains. She was 94 and had lived in Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., since moving from Washington in 1986.         Mrs. Douglas was the widow of former Senator Paul H. Douglas, who represented Illinois from 1949 to 1966. But having served in the House from 1945 to 1947, she was the first American woman to precede a husband to Congress. Both were Democrats.         In the House, Mrs. Douglas became a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and campaigned for the fledgling United Nations. She traveled in war-ravaged Europe and backed the relief efforts of the United Nations.         She introduced legislation for bookmobiles to bring library services to rural America, and such a bill eventually passed after her husband's election as the Hill-Douglas Act. Marched for Civil Rights         Mrs. Douglas was elected in 1944 after a campaign against isolationism and went to Washington as Representative-at-Large, representing Illinois as a whole. By 1946, the political climate had changed and her support of the Truman Administration's policies sank her bid for re-election.         During her husband's 18 years on Capitol Hill, Mrs. Douglas was an advocate of civil rights and marched with the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in Alabama. She was a representative to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization and other United Nations conferences. A Unitarian, she was also a moderator of the American Unitarian Association.         Mrs. Douglas was the author of "Appleseed Farm" (1948), a children's book; "Remember the Ladies" (1966), the story of women who helped shape America, and "Margaret Sanger" (1970), about the pioneer in family planning.         A native of Chicago, she was the daughter of Lorado Taft, the sculptor, and Ada Bartless Taft. After graduating from the University of Chicago, she studied acting.         Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois, yesterday called the Douglases good partners and said, "Together, Emily and Paul Douglas contributed immensely to Illinois and the nation."         Paul Douglas died in 1976. Mrs. Douglas is survived by a daughter, Dr. Jean Taft Douglas Bandler of Manhattan, and two grandsons.         Correction:  February 3, 1994, Thursday         An obituary on Tuesday about Emily Taft Douglas, a former Democratic Representive from Illinois, misstated the middle name of her mother, who died before her. She was Ada Bartlett Taft.       
         Rose Nussbaum Justin, a lawyer who held legal positions in New York City government, died on Jan. 17 at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. She was 83 and lived in the Bronx.         The cause was heart disease, said her daughter, Gail Justin.         After graduating from St. John's University Law School in 1932, Mrs. Justin was the chief counsel for the Bronx Legal Aid Society, an agent for the city's Investigation Division, a Civil Service examiner, a lawyer for the City Rent Commission and a referee in Small Claims Court. She was an administrative law judge for the Parking Violations Bureau for almost 20 years, starting in 1973. At various times she practiced law in Manhattan with her husband, David Justin, who died in 1982.         She is survived by her daughter and a son, Paul, both of Manhattan.       
         Hilda Simms, an actress best known for her starring role on Broadway in "Anna Lucasta," died on Sunday in Buffalo at the home of her sister Evelyn Sharp. She was 75 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer of the pancreas, her sister said.         "Anna Lucasta" and Ms. Simms's performance in the title role created a stir when the play, written by Philip Yordan and produced by the American Negro Theater, moved from Harlem to Broadway in 1944. For the first time, American playgoers saw an all-black cast acting in a drama that did not deal with racial issues. Ms. Simms played a middle-class woman who falls into prostitution and tries to fight her way back to respectability. The Road to Broadway         Ms. Simms, whose original surname was Moses, was born in Minneapolis.  She was one of nine children and studied teaching at the University of Minnesota until lack of money forced her to leave.         In 1943, Ms. Simms moved to New York. She acted in radio dramas and joined the American Negro Theater, where she was in charge of sound effects, props and publicity.         After appearing as a Southern ingenue in "Three's a Family," she was cast in "Anna Lucasta," a play written for white actors. Although most of the cast members were amateurs, the play received strong reviews and moved to Broadway. In 1947 Ms. Simms went with the play when it moved to London. While in Britain, she married the American actor Richard Angerolla. (Her first marriage, to William Simms in 1941, ended in divorce.)         Under the name Julie Riccardo, she also sang in Paris nightclubs before returning to the United States in 1953 to make the film "The Joe Louis Story." Her other film role was in "The Black Widow" (1954).         She also appeared in "The Cool World" (1960), "Tambourines to Glory" (1963) and a revival of "The Madwoman of Chaillot" (1970) in New York theaters. On television, she was in the series "The Nurses."         As the director of the creative arts program of the New York State division of human rights in the 60's, she focused attention on discrimination and the lack of roles for black actors in film and television. After earning a master's degree in education from City College, she worked for drug treatment programs in New York.         In addition to her sister Evelyn, she is survived by her husband, of Los Angeles; two brothers, Richard Ricco of Minneapolis and Emil Moses Jr. of Tucson, Ariz., and two other sisters, Laura Thompson of New Orleans and Rose Napue of Minneapolis.       
         Jarmila Novotna, a Czech-born lyric soprano who sang major roles at the Metropolitan Opera from 1940 to 1956, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         She died of natural causes, said her daughter, Jarmila Packard.         Miss Novotna was widely considered one of the finest singing actresses of her time. Her interpretations of such roles as Donna Elvira, Euridice, Manon, Melisande, Antonia and Marenka were praised for their intelligence and lyrical grace. She also excelled in trouser roles, particularly Orlofsky in "Die Fledermaus," Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Octavian in "Der Rosenkavalier." On hearing her American debut in San Francisco in "Madama Butterfly" in 1939, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times: "There is grace, warmth, communicative feeling in all that she does."  'Charming Simplicity'         She made her Metropolitan debut in "La Boheme" in 1940, singing with Jussi Bjoerling. The Times review noted her "charming simplicity, feeling and high artistic intelligence." That year Downes also praised her "great" Violetta at the Met: "She conceived the music, from first note to last, dramatically, and portrayed the character with an aristocratic sensibility and simplicity.         "The word and the tone were indissoluble; the phrasing was that of the finest musician."         In her years at the Metropolitan Opera, Miss Novotna sang 193 performances -- 142 in the opera house, the rest on tour -- and won consistent praise for her expressiveness and musicianship.         Her acting abilities and regal appearance also led to other offers: the director Max Reinhardt urged her to devote herself to the theater; the studio head Louis B. Mayer asked her to become a film star. During the course of her career, she appeared in Hollywood films ("The Great Caruso," "The Search"), on Broadway (as an unscrupulous concert singer in the 1953 drama "Sherlock Holmes") and on television (as Kim Stanley's mother in a postwar drama set in France). But she resisted all attempts to steer her away from singing, which was her first love.  Art as Beauty         "Of course there are many important things in life besides music," she said in a 1989 interview in Opera News, "but that doesn't make music unimportant. If you love music, what would life be without it -- can you imagine? Art is what brings beauty into life."         Miss Novotna studied with Emmy Destinn and made her debut at the age of 17 with the Prague National Opera. She continued her studies in Milan and became a member of the Vienna State Opera from 1933 to 1938, eventually singing opera and concerts in most of the major houses of Europe. The Met invited her to sing in 1928, but she did not want to be separated from her future husband, the Baron George Daubek, whom she married in 1931.         Toscanini brought her to the attention of the Met again after she sang Pamina under his direction in Salzburg in 1937. She came to New York in 1940, arriving, she noted years later, the day Hitler marched into Prague.  A Recording Re-released         During the war years she recorded "Songs of Lidice," in memory of the victims of the Nazi massacre. The recording, recently rereleased on CD by Supraphon, presents folk songs of her native land; the piano accompaniments are by Jan Masaryk, the son of the former president of Czechoslovakia.         Masaryk died in 1948, and the loss of his protection led to the nationalization of the Daubeks' 3,700-acre estate and castle. That same year, Miss Novotna appeared in Fred Zinnemann's film "The Search," as a mother seeking her lost son at the end of World War II.         Miss Novotna moved from Vienna to New York after her husband's death in 1981. She was frequently seen at opera performances and at events celebrating the art of singing.         In addition to her daughter, of New York City, she is survived by a son, George Daubek of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Andrea Heinemann Simon, a community leader in Riverdale, the Bronx, died yesterday at her home there. She was 84.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter, Joanna Walker.         Mrs. Simon served for more than 30 years on the board of directors of the Riverdale Mental Health Association. She also worked for the association as a fund-raiser. In addition, she was a director of the Riverdale Chapter of the United Nations Association.         Her husband, Richard L. Simon, was a co-founder of Simon & Schuster, the publishers. He died in 1960.         Mrs. Simon is survived by three daughters, Carly Simon, the singer and composer, Lucy Levine and Joanna Walker, all of Manhattan, and a son, Peter Simon of Chilmark, Mass.       
         Marjorie Keller Sitney, an independent film maker whose works have been shown at museums, festivals and film institutes around the world, died on Thursday in Winter Haven, Fla. She was 43 and lived in Wakefield, R.I.         The cause has not been determined, said her family, whom she was visiting.         Ms. Keller, married to the film scholar P. Adams Sitney but known by her maiden name, began exhibiting films in 1969. Among them are "Misconception" (1977), "Daughters of Chaos" (1980) and "Herein" (1992). She has had one-woman shows at the Museum of Modern Art and Anthology Film Archives in New York City. From 1986 to 1989 she was president of the New York Film Makers' Cooperative.         Ms. Keller was a teacher and lecturer at the University of Rhode Island, the San Francisco Art Institute and other institutions. Her book "The Untutored Eye: Childhood in the Films of Jean Cocteau, Joseph Cornell and Stan Brakhage," was published in 1985.         In addition to her husband and her parents, Clarence and Nellie Keller, she is survived by twin daughters, Augusta Nell and Miranda Hope; a stepson, Blake; a stepdaughter, Skye; four sisters, Jacquelyn Gilbert and Barbara Wilkens, both of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.; Patricia Button of Peeksill, N.Y., and Sarah Ann Filippini of Reston, Va., and two brothers, Clarence Christian Keller Jr. of Golden, Colo., and Stephen Lee Keller of Newark, Ohio.       
         Susanne M. Yardney, a Russian emigre and a patron of the arts died on Friday in her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was heart disease, said Dr. Jon Yardney, her son.         Mrs. Yardney came to the United States in 1940, settled in New York and was a founding member of Friends of Carnegie Hall. She and her late husband, Michel Yardney, also endowed a scholarship fund for young pianists through the America-Israel Cultural Foundation.         She is survived by a daughter, Maya Ryan of Manhattan; her son, of Wayne, Pa., and five granddaughters.       
         Mary Woodard Lasker, the philanthropist and champion of medical research and urban beautification, died on Monday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 93 years old and also had an apartment on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, said her nephew, James W. Fordyce. She made her last public appearance at a luncheon at the Pierre Hotel in October.         As a patron and volunteer lobbyist, Mrs. Lasker furthered medical research on cancer, heart and eye diseases and in other fields. She also lent her support to beautification projects in New York and Washington that included planting trees and flowers and providing fountains and lighting. And she was a noted hostess and art collector.         In her later years she reduced her activities, but at her death she was still president of the Albert and Mary Lasker Foundation, honorary president of the American Cancer Society and a trustee and vice chairman of the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Education Foundation.         In a 1958 speech, Robert Moses, then the Parks Commissioner, said Mrs. Lasker possessed "the irresistible combination Madison Avenue dreams of -- the blend of many essences in the beautiful package."         "Intelligence, vision, generosity, charm, kindness -- Mary has them all," Moses continued. Co-Founded Lasker Awards         Mrs. Lasker and her husband Albert Davis Lasker, a pioneer advertising executive who died in 1952, established the Lasker Foundation in 1942. In almost every year since 1944, it has given Albert Lasker Awards, largely for outstanding contributions to clinical and basic medical research.         The foundation has often been quick to recognize significant new research, and its awards have great prestige. Besides supporting medical research and health programs, it has also given its backing to efforts to beautify New York and to activities in the arts.         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served variously as chairman of the board of the American Cancer Society, a trustee of Research to Prevent Blindness and of the Cancer Research Institute and a director of the National Committee for Mental Hygiene. She was also active in other similar organizations.         "I am opposed to heart attacks and cancer and strokes," she used to say, "the way I am opposed to sin."         In addition, Mrs. Lasker strove to persuade Federal, state and city officials and legislators to provide more funds for medical research on major killing and crippling diseases. She worked to persuade Congress to increase appropriations for the National Institutes of Health and to set up additional research centers concentrating on specific diseases.         "Without money," she said in 1985, "nothing gets done." To make sure things got done, she used to visit the White House (during Democratic Administrations, she added wryly). She also paid calls on Washington legislators, corresponded with Presidents and arranged for scientists to meet Government leaders. 'I Couldn't Cut Up a Frog'         Despite her successes in furthering medical research, Mrs. Lasker used to contend that she lacked scientific and medical aptitude. "Nobody would have me in their laboratory for five minutes," she once said, also with a smile. "I couldn't cut up a frog, and I certainly couldn't perform surgery. I'm better at making it possible for other people."         Her passionate interest in medicine was fueled partly by illnesses of people around her and by her own health; she repeatedly had ear infections during her Wisconsin childhood. Laskers Lead to Nobels         Over the years, the Lasker Foundation helped shape medical history by recognizing and supporting promising research, and it has repeatedly singled out future winners of the Nobel Prize in Medicine. Fifty-one Lasker winners have become Nobel laureates.         For instance, the foundation's prize jury, whose longtime chairman is the heart surgeon Dr. Michael E. DeBakey, chose two winners of 1985 Albert Lasker Medical Research and Public Service awards -- Dr. Michael S. Brown and Dr. Joseph L. Goldstein of the University of Texas, for their studies of cholesterol chemistry in relation to the clogging of coronary arteries. They were also named Nobel Prize laureates that year.         Commenting on Mrs. Lasker's efforts, Dr. DeBakey said in a 1985 interview: "Mary Lasker is an institution unto herself. Asking what her importance has been is like asking what Harvard has meant to this country."         Throughout their history, Lasker awards have been given in every year except 1960, 1990 and 1992. In early 1990, when it was announced that no awards would be given that year, the foundation had assets of about $2.4 million, down from about $4.5 million in 1980, but an executive of the foundation said that omitting the awards, of $15,000 each, in that year "wasn't really a financial decision." Since then, the awards have been increased to $25,000 each. 'Annie Appleseed'         Like her passion for medical research, Mrs. Lasker's interest in and patronage of urban beautification was long standing. In a 1953 column in The New York Times, Meyer Berger referred to her affectionately as "Annie Appleseed."         Her beautification activities included furnishing funds for tulips, daffodils, begonias, chrysanthemums and other flowers at various locations in New York. Her other urban beautification projects ranged from lighted Christmas trees to 300 Japanese cherry trees donated to the United Nations.         Mrs. Lasker acquired her interest in parks and gardens during her girlhood in Watertown, Wis., where she was born to Frank Elwin Woodard, a banker, and Sara Johnson Woodard, who was a founder of two parks there.         She graduated cum laude from Radcliffe College in 1923 and studied briefly at Oxford. Then she went to work for the Reinhardt Galleries, in Manhattan, where her duties were, as she later put it, "arranging benefit loan exhibitions of outstanding old and modern French masters and selling pictures to collectors and museums." An Art Collector         She also went on buying trips abroad and began building an art collection of her own, which included works by Miro and Renoir. She sold most of the collection years later when she changed Manhattan homes, partly, as she said, "because I wanted to be able to give away the money."         In 1940, after leaving the art-gallery world, she married Mr. Lasker, who had achieved wealth and eminence as an advertising executive, having joined the Lord & Thomas advertising agency in 1898 and become its owner in 1908.         Two years later, he retired from active business and the Lasker Foundation was set up. In addition, drawing on his own experience in public affairs, he encouraged Mrs. Lasker to press Washington to provide more funds for research in medicine. In the decades that followed, her efforts in that direction bore many fruits.         One notable success was the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. "The N.I.H. has flowered," Dr. DeBakey recalled in the 1985 interview, "because in many ways she gave birth to it and nursed it. It was in existence, but it was she who got the funding for it."         Over the years, Mrs. Lasker also served on the boards of trustees or directors of a number of organizations and institutions, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the Museum of Modern Art, the Norton Simon Museum, New York University and Braniff Airways. Won Presidential Medal         She was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1969, a Congressional Gold Medal in 1989, and other honors. A Health Sciences professorship at the Harvard School of Public Health was named for her in 1989, and a new variety of pink tulip was named for her in 1985.         Mrs. Lasker's first marriage, in 1926 to Paul Reinhardt, the owner of the Reinhardt Galleries, ended in divorce in 1934.         Her sister, Alice Fordyce, was the executive vice president of the foundation and director of the Lasker Awards program. She died in 1992.         In addition to her nephew, Mr. Fordyce of Greenwich, who is a trustee of the foundation, Mrs. Lasker is survived by a stepdaughter, Frances Lasker Brody of Los Angeles; a stepson, Edward Lasker of Los Angeles; three great-nephews; five step-grandchildren, one of whom, Christopher W. Brody of Manhattan, is also a trustee of the foundation, and two step great-grandchildren.         Funeral rites and burial are to be private. A memorial service is to be held in the spring.       
         Grace Roosevelt McMillan, a photographer who was the eldest grandchild of President Theodore Roosevelt, died on Tuesday at the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. She was 82 and lived in Baltimore.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Born Grace Green Roosevelt in San Francisco, she graduated from the Sorbonne in Paris and became an accomplished freelance photographer. She was a trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art and the Greater Baltimore Medical Center. During World War II she managed the large McMillan family farm in Maryland while her husband served in the Navy in the Pacific.         She was the only daughter of Brig. Gen. Theodore Roosevelt Jr., a soldier, author and publisher, who died in the cross-Channel assault on Omaha Beach in 1944. A highly decorated officer and former Governor of Puerto Rico, he received the Congressional Medal of Honor posthumously.         Mrs. McMillan is survived by her husband of 60 years, William, a retired architect; a daughter, Eleanor McMillan of Bethesda, Md.; a son, William Jr., of Baltimore; a brother, Theodore Roosevelt 3d of Mount Desert, Me., and three granddaughters.       
         Ruth Mortimer Lancaster, curator of rare books and assistant librarian at Smith College in Northampton, Mass., died on Monday at her home in Williamsburg, Mass. She was 62.         Her husband, John Lancaster, said she had died of metastatic breast cancer.         Known professionally as Ruth Mortimer, she was a specialist in rare manuscripts and books, especially illustrated books of the Renaissance. Her detailed catalogues of such 16th-century French and Italian books at Harvard University's Houghton Library are standard reference works in the field.         In her honor, a room at Smith's Neilson Library was named the Mortimer Rare Book Room just before her death.         Ms. Mortimer, who was born in Syracuse, became associated with rare books while working as a student assistant in her freshman year at Smith. She graduated summa cum laude and received a certificate at the Shakespeare Institute of the University of Birmingham, England, as well as a master's degree at the Columbia University School of Library Service. Expanded Collections         She spent 18 years at Harvard's Houghton Library before returning to Smith as curator of rare books in 1975. Under her guidance, the Neilson Library added its Sylvia Plath and Virginia Woolf collections, along with materials ranging from the earliest printed books to contemporary fine-press books.         Ms. Mortimer also lectured in the art department and taught a course on the history of books until a few weeks ago.         She was the first woman to be elected president of the Bibliographical Society of America, serving from 1988 to 1992. In the 1980's she edited, with Mr. Lancaster, the society's quarterly journal. She also wrote many papers and articles for scholarly journals.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Juliet Sieveking Saunders, a former New York City school district superintendent whose doctoral dissertation became the basis for a handbook for the city's elementary school principals, died on Saturday at Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn. She was 86.         The cause of death was a heart attack, said Jack Bloomfield, a friend.         Mrs. Saunders started her career as a teacher and an assistant principal and then worked as principal at Junior High School 220 in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. In 1969, she was among the first district superintendents to be selected by the newly decentralized community school boards.         In her dissertation, written while she was a student at New York University's School of Education, Mrs. Saunders found that the city's elementary school principals performed an average of 446 different duties as part of their jobs.         The tasks ranged from helping to repair broken windows to fine tuning the school's curriculum. The study concluded that principals spent too much of their time doing routine paperwork and that they should get more help in managing their schools. A handbook for elementary school principals, published by the Board of Education, included much of this information and was edited by Mrs. Saunders.         She was named to the hall of fame at Hunter College, her alma mater, and received the Medal of Honor from the New York Academy of Public Education in 1988.         Mrs. Saunders's husband, Leonard, died in 1967.         She is survived by a nephew, Harry Saunders of Stamford, Conn.       
         Dr. Madeline C. Hunter, an educator and psychologist who translated a psychological learning theory into practical teaching techniques, died last Thursday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78 and lived in the Bel Air section of Los Angeles.         Dr. Hunter had a series of strokes, said the Graduate School of Education at the University of California at Los Angeles, where she was an adjunct professor.         Dr. Hunter was nationally known for her work at the Corinne A. Seeds University Elementary School, the laboratory school of U.C.L.A.'s Graduate School of Education. She served as its principal from 1963 until 1982, when she became a full-time professor in administration and teacher education at the graduate school.         She used her background in psychology to tailor different approaches for helping pupils learn. Her technique identified the most effective methods for teachers in helping pupils overcome any barriers to learning. Her research challenged the view that failure to learn stems from environmental factors like poverty, broken homes or a low I.Q. She believed that proper teaching methods could overcome any disadvantage.         "We have yet to find a student who won't learn," she once said.         She showed the effectiveness of teacher-parent partnerships in education and the importance of helping pupils maintain their self-respect.         A native of Saskatchewan, she grew up in Santa Monica, Calif., and earned four degrees in psychology and education at U.C.L.A. She began a career as a clinical psychologist and then became a school principal. She led schools in different sections of Los Angeles, including Watts and Bel Air, before becoming principal at university elementary.         She wrote 12 books and more than 300 articles on teaching.         Dr. Hunter is survived by her husband, Robert; a daughter, Cheryl,, of Los Angeles; a son, Robin, of Santa Monica; a sister, Dorothy Horner, of Los Angeles; and two grandchildren.       
         Doris C. Frankel, a playwright whose work found its way to Broadway, radio and television and who won an Emmy Award for her work on the soap opera "All My Children," died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 84.         The cause was a stroke, said her son Benjamin R. Barber.         Ms. Frankel was the author of "Love Me Long," which starred Shirley Booth and Anne Jackson on Broadway in 1949. She also wrote "Don't Throw Glass Houses," which was produced on Broadway in 1938.         Ms. Frankel was born in Manhattan, and graduated from Radcliffe College in 1931. Her husband, Phillip Barber, was the New York director of the Federal Theater, and Ms. Frankel was one of those involved in founding the Group Theater in the 1930's. At that time she also taught at the Yale Drama School.         Ms. Frankel also helped create the radio characters Ma Perkins and Helen Trent. Her television work during the 1950's included dramas for "Playhouse 90" and "Hallmark Hall of Fame."         In later years she was a head writer for daytime television dramas and wrote scripts for "General Hospital" and "Search for Tomorrow" in addition to "All My Children," for which she received an Emmy in the 1970's.         In addition to her son Benjamin, of Piscataway, N.J., she is survived by another son, Willson Barber of Becket, Mass., and five grandchildren.       
         Anita Morris, an actress who was nominated for a 1982 Tony Award for her exuberant performance as a brassy redhead in black-lace body stocking in the musical "Nine," died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 50.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, the director Grover Dale.         Ms. Morris was acting in George Lucas's next film, "Radioland Murders," in Wilmington, N.C., in December when the cancer was discovered, Mr. Dale said. She was forced to leave the production, and started treatment at that time.         Her musical number in "Nine," "Call From the Vatican," choreographed by Tommy Tune, caused a brief controversy when CBS censors decided it was too risque and banished it from the 1982 Tony Awards program. Ms. Morris was nominated that year for best featured actress in a musical, and also won a Drama Desk award for her performance. Sexy Telephone Call         In the number, Carla (Ms. Morris), a mistress of the director Guido (Raul Julia), got through to her lover when he was on a movie set by pretending that her telephone call was from the Vatican. Dancing on a pedestal, she proceeded to woo him by telephone. Frank Rich, writing in The New York Times, called the number "a dazzling choreographic gem," adding that Ms. Morris "superbly executes a one-body simulation of two-body copulation."         Ms. Morris, who was born in Durham, N.C., studied at the National Academy of Dramatic Arts and began her performing career in the American Mime Theater.         An appearance in the chorus of "Jesus Christ Superstar" in 1972 led to roles on Broadway in "Seesaw" (1973) and "The Magic Show" (1974), in which she was directed by her husband. Ms. Morris subsequently took over several leading roles on Broadway, including those in "Sugar Babies" in 1980 and "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas" in 1981.         On film, Ms. Morris played the mistress of Danny DeVito's character in "Ruthless People," and had roles in "The Hotel New Hampshire," "Maria's Lovers," "Absolute Beginners," "18 Again," "Blue City," "Me and the Kid" and "A Sinful Life."         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her parents, Dr. J. B. and Eloise Morris, and two brothers, Byron and Douglas, all of Durham, and a son, James.       
         Dorette Kruse Fleischmann, a civic leader and socialite in New York and Cincinnati, died yesterday at the Racquet Club in Chicago. She was 88.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Joan Tobin.         She and her husband, Julius Fleischmann, whose family made its fortune through yeast, were benefactors of many cultural and civic groups, including the New York Public Library, the Metropolitan Opera and the Council on Foreign Affairs.         Mrs. Fleischmann graduated from Smith College in 1927.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a son, Charles Fleischmann 3d of Cincinnati; another daughter, Dorette Fleischmann of The Plains, Va.; 10 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Elsa Victoria Lorne Harvey, chief executive of Lorne-Harvey Publications in Larchmont, N.Y., died on Tuesday at Greenwich Hospital in Greenwich, Conn. She was 62 and lived in Larchmont.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Harvey, known as Vicki, grew up in New York City, the daughter of Swedish immigrants. She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of City College.         Earlier in her career she worked as advertising director of Harvey World Famous Comics Inc., which had been founded by her future husband, Alfred Harvey. The company dealt with such titles as Blondie, Dick Tracy and Casper, the Friendly Ghost.         Lorne-Harvey Publications was formed in 1988 to re-issue some of her husband's earliest characters. These included the Black Cat. Company officials said a Black Cat motion picture is being prepared for production in Los Angeles by Motion PIcture Corporation of America.         Mrs. Harvey is survived by her husband; four sons, Alan, of Larchmont, Russel, of Manhattan, Adam, of Mamaroneck, N.Y., and Eric, of Larchmont; a stepdaughter, Shulamis Bush of Brooklyn; a sister, Ruth Korten of Winter Park, Fla.; a brother, Eric Lorne Sr. of Inverness, Fla., and three stepgrandchildren.       
         Francine Strickler-Greenspan, a former president of the Saxon Textile Corporation in Manhattan's TriBeCa area, died yesterday at Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. She was 57 years old and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was a brain tumor, her family said.         A graduate of Brooklyn College, Mrs. Strickler-Greenspan spent over 25 years with Saxon Textile, a firm founded by her parents, and became one of the first women to reach a top-level position in her industry. The company dyes and finishes twills, poplins and nylons for manufacturers. She served as its president from 1980 until her illness.         She is survived by her husband, Julian Greenspan; two daughters, Gail W. Strickler and Debbye Strickler, both of Manhattan, and a son, Dr. Howard Strickler of Washington.       
         Dr. Celia Yeack-Scranton, a physical sciences researcher for the International Business Machines Corporation in San Jose, Calif., died on Monday at the Mission Oaks Hospital in Los Gatos, Calif. She was 42.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Robert Scranton.         Dr. Yeack-Scranton, who lived in San Jose, conducted research into magnetic recording technology, in which she held several patents. Earlier this year she was named an I.B.M. Fellow for her work. She held a doctorate in applied physics from Stanford University.         Besides her husband she is survived by a son, Peter, and a daughter, Karen, both of San Jose, and her father, William R. Yeack of Gainesville, Fla.       
         Raquel Adonaylo, a soprano who was on the faculty of the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, died on Tuesday at her home in Rosemont, Pa. She was 67.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Rony Rogoff, a family friend.         An accomplished pianist, Miss Adonaylo gave recitals and appeared with orchestras in her native Uruguay before devoting herself to her singing career. She studied voice in France in the early 1950's and later performed in recitals, in chamber concerts and as a soloist with orchestras. She sang many major roles in operas produced by Uruguay's Symphony Orchestra.         In 1960, she was invited to perform the premiere of Ginastera's "Cantata para America Magica" in Washington, a work she later recorded for Columbia Records. In 1963 she moved from Uruguay to Israel, where she sang with the Israel Philharmonic under Leonard Bernstein, Zubin Mehta and other conductors. She was also a regular participant at the Marlboro Music School and Festival in Vermont and toured with Musicians From Marlboro. In 1975 she moved to the United States and joined the faculty of the Curtis Institute, where she taught until 1989.         She is survived by her husband, Jacko Peniazek; a daughter, Ana, and two sons, Pablo and Eduard, all of Rosemont.       
         Sayra Fischer Lebenthal, a Wall Street legend who was a co-founder in 1925 of the investment-banking firm of Lebenthal & Company and remained active in it for 67 years, died on Thursday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.         She died after a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Lebenthal was a newlywed when she and her husband, Louis S. Lebenthal, set up shop in a tiny office with second-hand furniture and no rugs. They sought their niche as bond traders and found it.         Bonds had been around since Colonial times, when they were used to finance militias, but in 1925 they were still considered an investment for millionaires. The new firm spotted an opening that had been missed by others: they looked for odd lots of small-denomination bonds from estates and other neglected sources and offered them to relatively modest savers.         The company thrived, continuing to do so after the death of Louis Lebenthal in 1951. Mrs. Lebenthal, grieving, decided to stay in business. She specialized in tax-exempt municipal bonds for small investors, and watched the market for them soar.         For years, she put in full workweeks checking the day's municipal offerings and dealing with clients by telephone until, at 92, a fall put her in failing health. She had already begun to delegate management control in thge 1980's and disposed of her majority holding in the firm about four years ago.         A native of Keyport, N.J., she graduated from Syracuse University Law School and was admitted to the New York Bar in 1923. Set to practice law, she married Mr. Lebenthal in 1925 and he persuaded her to go into a partnership as bond traders.         Mrs. Lebenthal was remarried in 1956 to I. Arnold Ross, a lawyer and former State Assemblyman. He died in 1981. She is survived by a daughter, Eleanor Lebenthal Bissinger of Manhattan; a son, Jim Lebenthal, the firm's chairman and spokesman, also of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Moon Hemingway, an author of food-processor cookbooks and a former editor of Vogue, House & Garden and Bride's magazines, died yesterday at her home in Kittery Point, Me. She was 76.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her husband, Booth Hemingway.         Mrs. Hemingway was the co-author, with Suzanne De Lima, of two cookbooks that first came out in the 1970's and were in print until recently. For a time Mrs. Hemingway and her co-author taught cooking together in Stamford, Conn.         One of their books, "Food Processor Magic: Six Hundred Recipes, Basic Techniques, Twists and Turns," was highly rated by critics when it appeared in 1976. It includes classic recipes as well as an eclectic array of recipes for other dishes, ranging from cranberry meatloaf to spinach nicoise. The other book is "Food Processor Baking Magic," published in 1978.         Mrs. Hemingway was born in Dorset, Vt., and attended schools in Switzerland and California before going on to Madeira School in McLean, Va. She was graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1939 and received an M.A. in theology in 1964 from Manhattanville College in Purchase, N.Y.         She was an oblate of St. Gregory's Abbey in Three Rivers, Mich., and an associate of St. Mary's Convent in Peekskill, N.Y.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Ann Hemingway Tarlton of Rumson, N.J.; two sons, John Moon Hemingway of Seattle and Booth Roy Hemingway of Kittery Point, and seven grandchildren.       
         Dr. Gordon G. Wallace, a sociologist and expert on women's reproductive health, died on Thursday at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington. She was 75.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Patricia Sears, a spokeswoman for Population Action International, a research group in Washington.         Since 1980 Dr. Wallace had been the director of the African women's health project at Population Action International and was an authority on female genital mutilation.         She was also a member of the boards of family planning, environmental and civic organizations. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and in 1942 received a doctorate in sociology from Yale University.         She is survived by her husband of 48 years, Robert W. Wallace of Washington, and three sons, Randall, of Manhattan, Scott, of Washington, and Bruce, of Tinicum Township, Pa.       
         Estelle Sommers, the administrator and joint owner of the nationwide Capezio Dance-Theater Shops and an arts patron who advised many important dance groups, died on Monday in her apartment in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Gayle Miller.         Mrs. Sommers was the widow of Ben Sommers, the dance philanthropist and head of Capezio Ballet Makers, the theatrical shoe company. Until his death at the age of 78 in 1985, she often collaborated with him on arts and business projects. In addition to administering the Capezio shops across the country, Mrs. Sommers owned and managed the Capezio Fashion Shop in New York City from 1964 to 1975.  Active in Organizations         Mrs. Sommers was best known in the dance world for the energetic way she championed a wide variety of causes and organizations in the United States and abroad. In 1988, she joined the overseers board of the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival in Becket, Mass., which named a studio in honor of her and her husband. Since 1979, she served as the United States chairwoman of the International Committee for the Dance Library of Israel, which presented her with its documents of dance award last year.         She was also on the board of the Dance Notation Bureau (and was the recipient of its annual award in 1991), the America-Israel Cultural Foundation, the Center for Dance Medicine, the International Ballet Competition U.S.A., the International Dance Alliance, the Joffrey School of Ballet, the Harkness Center for Dance Injuries, the Israeli Dance Institute and the Yard, a summer choreographic workshop on Martha's Vineyard.         Mrs. Sommers was a native of Baltimore. She entered the business world in 1947 when she converted a retail store in Cincinnati into a dance-supply business. She moved to New York City in 1962, the year she married Mr. Sommers; a previous marriage ended in divorce.         In addition to Ms. Miller, who is the president of Capezio Dance-Theater Shops, she is survived by two other daughters, Cathy Rano, vice president of Federated Department Stores, and Debbie J. Palmer; five grandchildren; four step-grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.         Funeral services will be held at noon today at the Central Synagogue, 123 East 55th Street, Manhattan.       
         Margery Beukema Leonard, who was a civic leader and charity volunteer in Seattle, died on Monday in Fort Belvoir, Va., at the Fairfax Retirement Community's health care center. She was 77 and had moved to Fort Belvoir in 1989 after 24 years in Seattle.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Leonard was born in Laredo, Tex., and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Vassar in 1937. She was a volunteer worker for the American Red Cross, the American Cancer Society and the American Heart Association.         She is survived by her husband, Charles F. Leonard Jr., a retired major general; three sons, Michael, of Washington, Col. Henry A., of Fort Riley, Kan., and Prof. Herman B., of Cambridge, Mass.; a daughter, Margaret L. Starbird of Tacoma, Wash.; a sister, Alice B. Miller of Fort Belvoir, 13 grandchildren and a great-grandchild.       
         Beatrice Card Fulcher, a retired educator with the Protestant Council of New York and the National Council of Churches, died last Sunday at Highland Farms, a retirement community near Black Mountain, N.C. She was 89.         Mrs. Fulcher, a native of Richmond, Me., was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Boston University. She started working as a high school Latin and English teacher in Massachusetts, and came to New York as an instructor at New York University.         Representing the Presbyterian Church, she served as director of Christian education for the Protestant Council's Manhattan division and the National Council of Churches for 28 years, beginning in 1938. She trained teachers and oversaw classes for physically handicapped children and directed a Harlem youth poverty program.         Mrs. Fulcher traveled all over the world, guiding Christian education tours in the 60's and 70's. She was also a teacher and superintendent in the Sunday school of the Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church for 25 years. She wrote for religious and educational magazines and appeared on broadcasts.         She was a past district deputy grand matron of the Eastern Star of New York State.         Mrs. Fulcher's husband, Dawson L. Fulcher Jr., died in 1961.       
         Margaret Millar, whose psychological mystery novels included "How Like an Angel," "A Stranger in My Grave" and "Beast in View," died on Saturday at her home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 79.         The cause was a heart attack, said Eleanor Van Cott, a trustee of her estate.         Mrs. Millar earned a reputation as a master of the suspense novel with her carefully constructed, literate mysteries populated by complex, sometimes disturbed characters and rooted in her belief that psychological terror achieved an effectively chilling "violence by implication."  What a Writer Knew         An avid reader of detective magazines as a child, she once told an interviewer: "They tell you always to write about what you know. What I knew was murder."         Mrs. Millar was born in Kitchener, Ontario. Her maiden name was Sturm. She began playing piano at the age of 4, and as a teen-ager performed on local radio programs. She was preparing for a musical career when a classics teacher fired her interest in archeology.         She won a scholarship to University College at the University of Toronto, where she contributed stories to the school's literary magazine. She left college without a degree, and in 1938 married Kenneth Millar, whom she had known since high school.         While recovering from an illness, Mrs. Millar wrote her first mystery, "The Invisible Worm" (1941), about a multiple murder. In short order, she turned out "The Weak-Eyed Bat" (1942), "The Devil Loves Me" (1942) and "Wall of Eyes" (1943). Her success led her husband to try his hand, as well. Under the pen name Ross Macdonald, he achieved a reputation that overshadowed her own. He died in 1983.         Mrs. Millar was prolific. She wrote 21 mystery novels, most of them set in Santa Barbara, notably "A Stranger in My Grave" (1961), "How Like an Angel" (1961), "The Fiend" (1964), "Beyond This Point Are Monsters" (1970) and "Banshee" (1983). "Beast in View" (1955), whose central character finds her personality splitting in two, received the Edgar Allan Poe Award for best mystery novel of the year from the Mystery Writers of America. Branching Out         She also wrote four nonmystery novels and a work of nonfiction, "The Birds and Beasts Were There" (1968).         In 1983, she received the Grand Master Award from the Mystery Writers of America. She served as the president of this organization in 1957 and 1958.         She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Schlagel of Santa Barbara.       
         Helen Wolff, an American editor and publisher whose taste and talents led to the acquisition and publication of major works of literature, died yesterday at her home in Hanover, N.H. She was 88.         The cause was apparently a heart attack, said her son, Christian.         Mrs. Wolff, who was regarded by her colleagues in the international book world as the grande dame of letters, published greatly acclaimed and successful works under the imprint "A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book," which she established with her husband at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich in 1961. The Wolffs were particularly respected for bringing out translations of distinguished European authors.         After her husband's death in a traffic accident in West Germany in 1963, she remained as the imprint's sole publisher at Harcourt Brace Jovanovich without losing any authors to other publishing houses. Mrs. Wolff retired in 1986, but was regularly consulted about acquisitions and translations. The Wolff imprint has continued to flourish at Harcourt Brace. The Merits of Literature         "The joy of publishing is to see good works become generally recognized," Mrs. Wolff once said. "Literature can do surprisingly well."         Among the authors with whom she worked closely were Gunter Grass, Umberto Eco, Max Frisch, Georges Simenon, Stanislaw Lem and Amos Oz. She also published Anne Morrow Lindbergh's best-selling "Gift From the Sea."         "I don't plan to write my memoirs, and I will tell you why," Mrs. Wolff said in 1982 when she was the subject of a profile in The New Yorker. "If one writes oneself, one closes out the writing of others. I've never been able to understand editors who could also write. You have to keep yourself open for the creative efforts of authors; you must be totally receptive. It's like being a priest, and I don't think priests should be married. Nor do I think editors should write. Kurt and I found our creativity and our life in editing and publishing."         The Wolffs brought to publishing a European sensibility that went beyond the demands and vagaries of the marketplace. Early in this century, Kurt Wolff was Franz Kafka's first publisher, at Kurt Wolff Verlag in Germany. The couple left Germany in the 1930's and lived in Italy and France before immigrating to the United States in 1941 to escape the Nazis. A Founder of Pantheon Books         The Wolffs founded Pantheon Books in New York in 1942 and went on to publish works that included Boris Pasternak's "Doctor Zhivago." They nurtured that company and remained with it until 1961, when they resigned and moved to Europe. Shortly thereafter, Pantheon was acquired by Random House. The couple's next venture, the Helen and Kurt Wolff imprint, began at the invitation of the publisher William Jovanovich.         Mrs. Wolff was a step ahead of rival American publishers in acquiring important foreign books because of her fluency in several languages. At the annual Frankfurt Book Fair, for example, she could read a manuscript in its original German, French or Italian and make a decision about it overnight.         Mrs. Wolff, whose name was originally Helen Mosel, was born in 1906 in Macedonia. Her father was German and her mother was of Hungarian and Austrian parentage. At home, Helen, her sister and her parents spoke German, Turkish and Serbian. Arriving Poor in New York         After World War I, she attended boarding schools in Vienna and discovered that she had a gift for languages, including English. In 1927, she went to Munich as a trainee at Kurt Wolff Verlag, where she became a full-time employee in charge of art books. She and Mr. Wolff, who was 20 years her senior and divorced, were married in London in 1933. Their son was born the next year.         When the Wolffs arrived in New York, they were nearly penniless. In 1942, they persuaded three investors to contribute a total of $7,500, which enabled the creation of Pantheon Books. Mrs. Wolff recalled that her personal budget at that time was a dollar a day. The next year, they were joined by Jacques Schiffrin, who had founded Editions Pleiade in Paris and who brought many fine books to Pantheon.         The Wolffs' first success in the United States was a new edition of the Grimm fairy tales, in 1944. Under their own imprint, they published a number of important works, both fiction and nonfiction. After her husband's death, Mrs. Wolff was responsible for such notable novels as Italo Calvino's "Invisible Cities," a retranslated edition of Giorgio Bassani's "Garden of the Finzi-Continis," Mr. Grass's "Flounder," Mr. Oz's "My Michael" and Mr. Eco's "Name of the Rose."         In 1981, for her contributions to international publishing, Mrs. Wolff was awarded the Inter Nationes Award for Literature and the Arts by the West German Government. In 1985, she was given the Goethe Medal by Goethe House, the German cultural institute in New York City.         In addition to her son, a professor of music and classics at Dartmouth College, she is survived by a stepson, Nikolaus Wolff of Norwich, Vt.; a stepdaughter, Maria Stadelmayer of Hamburg, Germany; a brother, George Mosel of Santiago, Chile; a sister, Elizabeth Steinbeis of Brannenburg, Germany, and 10 grandchildren.       
         Melina Mercouri, the vivacious actress with a husky laugh who went on to become Greece's Minister of Culture, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. Miss Mercouri, whose greatest screen success was her role as a flamboyant prostitute in the 1960 film "Never on Sunday," was 68, her family said, although references disagree on the year of her birth.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Patricia Turi, a hospital spokeswoman. Miss Mercouri was hospitalized in early February and underwent surgery on Feb. 23 to remove cancerous tissue, but her conditioned deteriorated on Saturday because of an infection, Ms. Turi said.         Coming from a politically prominent family, the actress was a passionate anti-Fascist who lost her citizenship and property in 1967 for her aggressive opposition to the junta that held power in Athens for seven years, until 1974. She then speedily returned home and entered politics, winning election to Parliament in 1977 as a Socialist. Miss Mercouri was appointed Culture Minister in 1981 after the Socialists won a landslide victory. She served in the post until 1989, when her party lost power, and then returned when the party was re-elected in October.         "Never on Sunday," the story of a nurturing trollop who refused to work more than six nights a week, established Miss Mercouri as an international star. The movie was directed by Jules Dassin, her close companion and later her husband. Mr. Dassin, the son of a New York barber, fled to Europe after being blacklisted in Hollywood in the 1950's.         Mr. Dassin directed, and often wrote and produced, most of Miss Mercouri's nearly 20 other movies, including "He Who Must Die" (1957), about life overtaking a Passion play in a primitive village on Crete; Mr. Dassin co-adapted the story from the novel "The Greek Passion," by Nikos Kazantzakis. Other joint efforts included "Phaedra," a 1961 tale of a woman lusting for her stepson, and "A Dream of Passion," a 1978 variation of Medea's child-murders. Both were based on, or inspired by, ancient Greek dramas.         Their other team efforts included "Topkapi," a well-regarded 1964 museum-theft caper; "10:30 P.M. Summer," a 1966 story of a descent into alcoholism, and "Promise at Dawn" (1970), from a memoir by Romain Gary about his unconventional mother.         Miss Mercouri conquered Broadway in a 1967 musical adaptation of "Never on Sunday" titled "Illya Darling," prompting Walter Kerr of The New York Times to hail her as "a creature you'd be happy to take home to mother, if mother was out." Politics and Pacifism         The outspoken actress and politician with a flashing smile and feline movements was a favorite of interviewers, who called her a charming, forceful and quotable woman very much in love with life. She spoke French, German and English, as well as Greek.         Of her return from exile, she remarked in 1988: "It became impossible not to interfere in politics. When you are born Greek, you are always in a state of alert about social things." She was also a pacifist, declaring in her 1971 autobiography, "I Was Born Greek," that the "quickest way to get disarmament is if John and Jean and Ivan refuse to pay one penny's tax" for weapons.         Asked about feminism, she replied: "I have never been discriminated against. I have made my life as a woman, and that's not bad." Of marriage, she remarked: "If you take a European woman's husband, she has nothing. But if you take an American husband, you make the wife rich." As for love, she commented: "All any woman wants is to sleep with a man. It is simple. Life is simple."         Maria Amalia Mercouri was born in Athens on Oct. 18, 1925, the daughter of a longtime Minister of the Interior and the granddaughter of a much-admired, longtime Mayor of Athens, who nicknamed her Melina, meaning honey, the usual color of her hair in later years.         Her family's home was open to people from all classes, from scholars to beggars, and meals were shared by up to 100 guests. The wide-ranging contacts and conviviality made her an egalitarian and gave her a liberal education while she resolved to be an actress.         Her parents opposed her acting, so, at 17, she eloped with Panayiotis Characopos, an elderly, wealthy Athenian sympathetic to her study of classical Greek tragedy at the National Theater Academy. After three years of preparation, she went on the Athens stage, won increasingly big parts and was acclaimed in the leading roles in "Mourning Becomes Electra" and "A Streetcar Named Desire." She also starred on the Paris stage and made her film debut as a doomed cabaret entertainer in "Stella," a 1955 melodrama directed by Michael Cacoyannis.         A major turning point occurred at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival, where she met Mr. Dassin. Though married to others, they immediately forged a deep personal and professional partnership. They were married a decade later.         Miss Mercouri was widely praised for her Madonna-prostitute role in "He Who Must Die" and, three years later, for her hedonistic prostitute in "Never on Sunday," for which she won an award as best actress at Cannes and an Academy Award nomination.         Her other films included "The Gypsy and the Gentleman" (1958), "Where the Hot Wind Blows" (1959), "The Victors" (1963), "A Man Could Get Killed" (1966), "Gaily Gaily" (1969) and "Nasty Habits" (1976). Reviewers repeatedly hailed her performances as exuberant, but sometimes extravagant and overwrought.         In her political career, she represented the working-class district of Piraeus, the port of Athens, which had been the setting for "Never on Sunday." She kept an office there, meeting with constituents twice a week and discussing problems dealing with Government services and women's issues. "I like myself better now," she said in 1978. "It feels better to care about other people's interests -- to be involved."         Through the 1980's, Miss Mercouri often made headlines because of her obsessive effort to regain for Greece the Elgin Marbles of the Acropolis. The sculptures were bought from the Turkish ruler of Greece in the early 1800's by a British ambassador, Lord Elgin, and later placed in the British Museum. As Minister of Culture, she also strove to revive classical Greek culture by increasing Government subsidies for the arts, building provincial libraries and pressing for the preservation of historic monuments.         In exile, Miss Mercouri and her husband lived mainly in Paris. In later years, their main home was in Athens, and they had a vacation home on the Greek island of Spetsai.         She is survived by her husband and by a brother, Spiros Mercouris.       
         Judith Schwartz, a designer of commercial and residential interiors in New York, died last Friday at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 51 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Schwartz was active in community affairs as a trustee of the Park East Synagogue and a board member of the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation. She established a Judith Schwartz scholarship fund at the Rabbi Arthur Schneier Park East Day School and served as a representative of the Women's International Zionist Organization to the United Nations.         A native of Manhattan, she graduated from Finch College, trained at New York School of Interior Design and received a degree in decorative arts at Parsons School of Design. She headed Better Home Furnishing Company from 1965 to 1981, when she established J.R.S. Interiors Inc., her current firm in Manhattan.         Mrs. Schwartz is survived by her husband of 30 years, Stanley; two daughters, Blair and Kim; her mother, Blanche Rosenzweig Levine of Bal Harbour, Fla.; a sister, Carol Nussbaum of Charleston, S.C., and a brother, Lawrence Rosenzweig of Manhattan and Bal Harbour.       
         Natalie Hall Rowe, a musical-comedy star and opera singer in New York and London in the 1920's and 30's, died last Friday at her home in Edgecomb, Me. She was 89.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Betty Gruendel of Edgecomb.         As Natalie Hall, she made her Broadway debut in the chorus of "Iolanthe" in 1926. A lyric soprano, she then played a variety of roles with the American Opera Company from 1928 to 1930, including Marguerite in "Faust" and the leads in "Carmen" and "Yolanda in Cyprus."         She appeared with her sister, Bettina, in "Three Little Girls" in 1931. The next year, she had roles in "Through the Years" and "Music in the Air."         Miss Hall won critical acclaim for her performance as the lead in "The Merry Widow" in Central City, Colo., in 1933. Later that year, she went to London to star in the West End production of "Ball at the Savoy." Returning to New York, she played in "Music Hath Charms," "Otello" and "Nights of Song" and in a production of "Showboat" on Randalls Island in 1938.         In the 1940's she lived in Hamilton, N.Y., where her husband, Edward C. Rowe, was a lawyer at Colgate University. In 1964 the couple moved to Maine, where Miss Hall appeared in many productions at the Brunswick Music Theater. Mr. Rowe died in 1974.         Miss Hall was born in Warwick, R.I.         She is survived by her daughter and a sister, Bettina Rubicam of Scottsdale, Ariz.       
         Betty Furness, who went from doing television commercials for Westinghouse refigerators to pioneering the field of consumer affairs as a television journalist, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in New York City and Hartsdale, N.Y..         She had been treated for cancer for three years, said her husband, Leslie Midgley.         Her career spanned six decades. She began as a Hollywood actress in the 1930's and became a television spokeswoman for Westinghouse appliances in the 1950's. Between 1976 and 1992 she was a regular contributor to the "Today" program on NBC.         In 1967 President Lyndon B. Johnson appointed her his special assistant for consumer affairs, though consumer groups feared that because of her association with Westinghouse, she would go easy on American industry.         She became a forceful advocate for American consumers, one who took strong stands on issues like credit regulation and federal meat inspection.         Elizabeth Mary Furness was born Jan. 3, 1916, in New York City. She was the daughter of an executive for Union Carbide. She attended the Brearley School and Bennett Junior College. Modeling and Acting         Her acting career began at age 14 when she got a modeling job with the John Robert Powers agency. Later Mr. Powers arranged for her to take a screen test.         She eventually went to Hollywood, where she appeared in 35 films, most of them low-budget productions, over the next six years.         Ms. Furness also worked in the theater in summer stock and road productions, among them "Doughgirls" and "My Sister Eileen," then moved to television.         In 1949 she had a small part in a CBS "Studio One" drama production that led Westinghouse to offer her the job as their spokeswoman. That lasted for 11 years.         She added the sentence "You can be sure if it's Westinghouse" to popular language in her live spots for refrigerators and vacuum cleaners.         She went on to do the ads in 1952 at the Republican and Democratic national conventions. Recruiter for Head Start         She first worked for President Johnson during the 1964 presidential campaign. Afterward was hired as a recruiter for the Head Start and Vista programs. In 1967 she became assistant to the President for consumer affairs.         She eventually became executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board and then commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs.         She joined WNBC-TV in New York City in 1974 and later made appearances on the network's "Today" show. As a reporter, she went from responding to consumer complaints to extensive investigations of issues like fetal alcohol syndrome, car safety and product liability lawsuits.         She is survived by her husband ; a daughter, Barbara Green; three stepchildren, Leslie Midgley, Andrea Connors and Peter J. Midgley, and two grandchildren.       
         Aida Anthony Whedon, an artist and a teacher to generations of children, died yesterday at her home in Port Washington, L.I. She was 78.         Her New Orleans accent unaltered despite half a century in New York, Mrs. Whedon was a bustling mother hen for thousands of children at the Whedon School of Art, which she and her husband, Daniel Whedon, a sculptor, operated.         Mrs. Whedon's works are in many collections, including the North Shore Unitarian Church of Plandome, L.I., the universities of Maine, Chicago and Rutgers, and many banks and corporations. After her first show at the Walker Gallery in New York in 1937, she had one-person shows at the South Street Museum, the Graphic Eye Gallery in Port Washington, and galleries in England, Maine, New York and Long Island.         She is survived by her husband; two children, Roger Anthony Whedon and Susan Whedon, and two grandchildren, Arie Daniel Whedon and Amelia Whedon.       
         Dr. Annemarie P. Weil, a child psychiatrist and psychoanalyst, died on Friday at a convalescent home in Bryn Mawr, Pa., near Philadelphia. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         She had had a long illness, said her daughter, Dr. Susan Caroline Weil.         Dr. Weil was in private practice in Manhattan, her daughter said, and at her death was also on the faculty of the New York Psychoanalytic Institute. Dr. Weil graduated from the institute in 1949 and joined its faculty in 1959. She was a supervising and training analyst there, as well as a teacher.         Dr. Ted E. Becker Sr., a former chairman of the institute's child analysis committee, said that Dr. Weil's "primary interest and research had to do with the neurological and organic aspects of child development."         She was born Annemarie Phiebig in Berlin and earned her Doctor of Medicine degree from the University of Basel, Switzerland, in 1934. She and her husband, Dr. Frederic S. Weil, came to the United States from Switzerland in 1940 and settled in Manhattan.         Dr. Weil went on to be a junior psychiatrist on the staff of Bellevue Hospital, a senior psychiatrist at the Child Development Center and a member of the faculty of the Columbia University Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research. She wrote many papers in her field and received several awards.         Her husband, also a psychoanalyst, died in 1959 after 22 years of marriage.         In addition to her daughter, a hematologist in Wynnewood, Pa., Dr. Weil is survived by two grandsons and a brother, Albert Phiebig of White Plains.       
         Deane W. Lord, a public relations official at Harvard University for 35 years, died on Tuesday at Youville Hospital in Cambridge, Mass. Mrs. Lord, who lived in Cambridge, was 67.

Mrs. Lord began her career at Harvard as a public relations officer at Radcliffe College in 1958 and became director of that school's news office two years later. In 1973 she became director of the Harvard News Office, and was named director of information in 1981.         She was a 1948 graduate of Bennington College and received a master's degree in dramatic arts from Smith College.

Dr. Liskin is survived by her husband, Dr. Vincent Bonagura; twin daughters Elizabeth and Rebecca; her parents, Anita and Louis Liskin of Englewood; two brothers, David, of Carmel, Calif., and Max, of Nashville, and two sisters, Diana Chapman of Tokyo and Alisa Clausen of Aabenraa, Jutland, Denmark.       
         Betty Furness, who went from minor acting roles to reknown as a television saleswoman and then became a formidable consumer advocate, died on Saturday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in New York City and Hartsdale, N.Y.         The cause was stomach cancer, said her husband, Leslie Midgley.         With the cheekbones of a model and the directness of a New England schoolmarm, Miss Furness was one of the true pioneers in television consumer journalism. In her heyday with WNBC-TV in New York, she regularly broadcast the names of errant businesses and shoddy products. She pointed television cameras at stores where New Yorkers had been cheated, and lectured the proprietors. She reported on hamburger that was too fat, on warranties that were too lean, on gadgets that were too temperamental and on business ethics that she saw as seriously flawed. She even scolded Macy's. Park Avenue Upbringing         Miss Furness essentially created a place for consumer advocacy on local television. She also spent a great deal of time off the screen promoting the cause of consumer justice. She was on the board of Consumers Union, which publishes Consumer Reports magazine, from 1969 until she retired for health reasons in 1993, and she worked for Common Cause. She also was President Lyndon B. Johnson's special assistant for consumer affairs and was head of the New York State Consumer Protection Board in 1970 and '71. She was Commissioner of the New York City Department of Consumer Affairs in 1973.         Miss Furness, who had surgery for stomach cancer in 1990, was eased out of the "Today" show on NBC in 1992 after 16 years with the program. "This was their idea, not mine," she said dryly as she departed.         Miss Furness, whose original name was Elizabeth Mary Furness, was born on Jan. 3, 1916, in New York City, the daughter of George Choate Furness, an executive with what was then called Union Carbon and Carbide, and Florence Sturtevant Furness. The Furness family was well off and young Betty was raised on Park Avenue and sent to the Bennett School in Dutchess County, N.Y. In 1932, before graduating, she dropped out to become an actress.         It was the Depression, and her father had advised her to learn "something useful." She got summer jobs with the John Robert Powers Modeling Agency, but to her father's dismay earned only $80 in two summers of work. But she was blonde and trim, and Mr. Powers noticed her. He liked the way she used her voice and her gray-green eyes, and he arranged for her to take a screen test at RKO.         The only acting she had done was in school theatricals, but just a year after she left the Bennett School, RKO was touting her as a bright new talent. She had secondary roles in 35 films in Hollywood and later called them all appalling except "Swing Time," which starred Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers, and "Magnificent Obsession," both produced in the mid-1930's. She left the screen in 1937 and moved to the stage. With few exceptions -- the stock and road productions of "Golden Boy," "My Sister Eileen" and "Doughgirls" -- the career that had started with promise seemed to be going nowhere. Early TV Participant         In 1948, with commercial television just starting, Miss Furness landed a job with the DuMont Television Network, which signed her to do a 15-minute show called "Fashions, Coming and Becoming."         A year later, somebody at Westinghouse saw her in a "Studio One" drama and offered her a job as the company's representative on television. For more than 11 years Miss Furness was a staple on evening television, frequently standing in front of refrigerators and waxing eloquent about their performance.         In 1952, 1956 and 1960, Miss Furness did the Westinghouse commercials during the Republican and Democratic National Conventions and developed a strong interest in politics. She worked for Abraham Ribicoff in Connecticut when he made his first successful race for the United States Senate in 1962. After meeting Lady Bird Johnson and Muriel Humphrey, she also made recruiting trips for Head Start and Vista, the Volunteers in Service to America. Left Rockefeller Job         In 1962, she was the hostess of a five-minute radio show called "A Woman's World," in which she talked about food, clothes, child rearing, family relationships, teen-agers and the aged. Late in 1962, she worked on an ABC-TV show called "Answering Service." The show was nominated for an Emmy Award, but ABC dropped her all the same.         Miss Furness abruptly quit as Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller's consumer affairs adviser in 1971, charging that the New York State Legislature did not take her recommendations seriously enough. She ran New York City's Department of Consumer Affairs in 1973. After that she worked briefly for McCall's magazine as a contributing editor and wrote a column for consumers.         Despite the number and diversity of her activities, she was never able to completely shake off her image as a product saleswoman. "I feel I'm a very serious person who wants to do things," she once said, "but people keep talking about refrigerators. I'm tired of telling the story about the refrigerator door that didn't stick, and I'm bored with the image."         In 1937 Miss Furness married Johnny Green, the composer and conductor, with whom she had a daughter, Barbara. The couple divorced in 1943. In 1945, she married Hugh B. Ernst, a radio announcer, who died in 1950. She married Mr. Midgley, a CBS News producer, in 1967.         In addition to her husband and her daughter, she is survived by three stepchildren, Leslie Midgley, Andrea Connors and Peter J. Midgley, and two grandchildren.       
         Lois R. Murphy, an expert on environmental law and a partner in the New York law firm of Cahill, Gordon & Reindel, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 49 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was an acute respiratory incident, her family said.         She was a graduate of Pace University Law School, where she was editor in chief of the Environmental Law Review. She later served as assistant regional counsel of the New York Environmental Protection Agency. She joined Cahill, Gordon as an associate in 1988 and became a partner this January.         She is survived by her husband, Eugene Zuriff; her daughter, Jennifer Reisman of Atlanta; two stepsons, Laurence Zuriff of Washington and Bryan Zuriff of Los Angeles, and a sister, Judith, who lives in Florida.       
         Luba Potamkin, a broadcasting spokeswoman in the 1970's for her family's Cadillac auto dealerships on the East Coast, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 73.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her husband, Victor Potamkin.         Three years after her husband founded Potamkin Cadillac in 1972, Mrs. Potamkin and other members of her family appeared in television commercials that featured the line: "If this nameplate isn't on the back of your car, you probably paid too much."         The ebullient commercials, which were also broadcast by Potamkin dealerships on television stations in Pennsylvania and Florida, were noticed. Mr. Potamkin said his forceful merchandising in New York helped his sales.         Mrs. Potamkin, the former Luba Chalken, was born in Philadelphia. She was married to Victor for 52 years and for a large part of that time was content to be a wife and mother to her two sons.  Fighting Against Alzheimer's         She said of her career as a Cadillac spokeswoman on television, which she amplified to include health and fashion tips, that she never studied a script in advance. She told an interviewer in 1977, "To me, it's easy because it's my business and I'm thrilled to say, 'Buy a Cadillac.' "         Her son Alan recalled yesterday that the ad campaign was hatched by his father, who convinced his wife, who was at first reluctant, to do it.         The Potamkin family relinquished the dealership in 1987, selling the assets and leasing the company's Manhattan real estate to General Motors.  For several years the dealership fell into decline under new operators with a more muted television campaign.         Two years ago the Potamkin family resumed operations under the name Potamkin Cadillac-Buick-Chevrolet.         Mrs. Potamkin then became a symbol of the fight against Alzheimer's disease, which she was diagnosed as having in the late 1970's. She and her husband made major donations to research into the disease, and in 1987 the Potamkin family created the Potamkin Prize for Alzheimer Research, an annual award of $100,000. They were also active in sponsoring fund-raising events for medical research.         In addition to her husband, who maintains homes in New York, Philadelphia and Miami, she is survived by two sons, Robert, of Philadelphia and Alan, of Miami; a sister, Florence Jans of Miami; a brother, Marvin Chaiken of Tucson, Ariz., and three grandchildren.       
         Sonia Raiziss, a New York literary figure for many years, died on March 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 85 and also had a home in Bucks County, Pa.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said Alfredo de Palchi, her collaborator and former husband.         A poet, translator and critic, Ms. Raiziss was an editor of Chelsea, a semi-annual avant-garde literary magazine featuring poems and prose by promising new writers. She became an editor of the magazine in 1960, two years after its founding.         Chelsea published early work by such authors as Sylvia Plath, Umberto Eco, Raymond Carver and Grace Paley. Many of its back numbers are collectors' items. Published as High School Student         A native of Germany, Ms. Raiziss was brought to this country as a child and grew up in Philadelphia. Her earliest poems were published while she was in high school, and her subsequent work appeared widely in literary magazines.         She earned undergraduate and doctoral degrees at the University of Philadelphia, where her father, the biochemist Dr. George W. Raiziss, was a professor. She also studied at Columbia University and published her first collection of poems, "Through a Glass Darkly," as a student at the Sorbonne.         Her first book of criticism, "Metaphysical Passion: Seven Modern American Poets and the 17th-Century Tradition," was published in 1952 by the University of Philadelphia and reissued by Greenwood Press in 1970. "Bucks County Blues," a volume of her poetry that appeared in 1977, also remains in print.         Most recently, she was the translator of "The Scorpion's Dark Dance" (1993), a volume of Italian poetry by Mr. de Palchi.         She is survived by a son, Peter St. Mu Raiziss of Sacramento, Calif.       
         Shirley M. Sills, the executive vice president of PTN Publishing Company in Melville, L.I., died yesterday in her home in Manhasset, L.I. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Stanley S. Sills.         Mrs. Sills was an executive for six years at PTN Publishing, which produces 30 financial magazines relating to businesses like photography, chemicals and security services. Before that, for six years, she was the president of the General Medical Book Company in Manhattan.         She was a graduate of the State University of New York at Geneseo and received a master's degree in psychology from Hofstra University.         She is survived by her husband; two sons, Dr. Michael N. Sills of Dallas and David C. Sills of Roslyn, L.I., and three grandchildren. She also leaves a sister-in-law, Beverly Sills, the chairwoman of Lincoln Center.       
         Evan Burger Donaldson, president of the board of Spence-Chapin Services to Families and Children in New York, a nonprofit adoption service, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. Mrs. Donaldson, who lived in Manhattan, was 60.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said her husband, William H. Donaldson.         Mrs. Donaldson was also involved with the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, the New York Women's Association and the Ackerman Institute for Family Therapy. She graduated from Vassar College.         She is survived by her husband, who is the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, a daughter, Kimberly Donaldson-Plym, and a son, Matthew, all of New York.       
         Carola Goya, an American-born Spanish dancer and a virtuoso castanet player, died early Sunday morning at her home in Manhattan. She was 88.         The cause was apparently a heart attack in her sleep, said her niece, Victoria B. Smith of Kent, Conn.         Ms. Goya, an authority on many idioms of Spanish dance, was noted for her ability to choreograph works that united traditional folk and flamenco steps with concert music by Spanish composers including Isaac Albeniz, Enrique Granados, Manuel de Falla and Joaquin Turina.         She is believed to have been the first performer to treat castanets not simply as devices to enhance dancing, but also as solo instruments. As a castanet player, she appeared with the Detroit Symphony, the Kansas City Philharmonic, the Symphony of the Air and other ensembles. Her performances became, in effect, concertos for castanets and orchestra, and her repertory extended from Spanish pieces to compositions by Bach, Chopin and Auber. She once said, "Unlike a thing attached, the castanets should appear as part of the hand, as if born with the hand."         Ms. Goya was a daughter of Samuel Weller, a personal representative for several New York actors. She adopted Goya as her professional name and later as her legal surname. She studied Spanish dance in New York and Madrid with many teachers, and ballet in New York with Michel Fokine and at the Metropolitan Opera Ballet School. After appearing with the Metropolitan Opera Ballet as a teen-ager, she made her debut as a Spanish dancer with a solo concert in New York in 1927.         In the 1920's and 30's, she often toured with her sister, Beatrice Burford, a harpist. She danced before Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt in the White House at the Ambassadors' Banquet of 1936. As a member of the Jose Greco Dance Company, she toured Europe and North and South America from 1947 to 1951.         In 1954, she formed a partnership with Matteo Vittucci, a dancer professionally known as Matteo; they were married in 1974. Together, they performed and taught extensively and, since 1967, directed the New York-based Foundation for Ethnic Dance. Ms. Goya also contributed articles to Dance Magazine and other publications.         An elegant woman of stately demeanor, Ms. Goya was much in demand as a teacher and at her death was preparing to teach in Spain with her husband, who survives. Over the years, she was a faculty member at institutions including the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, the Connecticut College School of Dance and, in New York, the High School of Performing Arts and the American Theater Wing.       
         Julia Andrews Bissell, a patron of the arts and moving force in the restoration of the historic Kenmore mansion and museum in Fredericksburg, Va., died on Sunday at the Medical College of Georgia Hospital in Augusta. She was 87 and had homes in Chadds Ford, Pa., and Aiken, S.C.         She had been ill for a long time, her family said.         Mrs. Bissell, of the duPont family of Wilmington, Del., was also associated with the Winterthur Museum and Gardens near Wilmington. She was a past president and longtime member of the board of the Delaware Art Museum and a trustee of the Friends of American Art at Yale University.         Her patronage of Kenmore, a pre-Revolutionary Georgian mansion and one of the country's foremost house museums, spanned more than half a century. It was the home of Fielding Lewis, whose wife, Betty, was George Washington's only sister.         Kenmore, a rambling mansion, is noted for its interiors and period furnishings that are based on inventories taken in 1782 before the sale of the original contents. Over the years, Mrs. Bissell served as chairman of the collections and garden committees, chairman of the board of regents and, twice, as president of the board.         According to Vernon Edenfield, director of Kenmore, "through her gifts the collections were enriched and through her vast knowledge the museum grew and thrived."         In addition to her support for historic preservation, Mrs. Bissell was a noted horticulturist and expert in camellias, for which she won prizes at gardening competitions. Her winter home in Aiken, S.C. -- built in 1905 by her parents, James N. and Julia Sophie duPont Andrews -- is surrounded by woodland gardens.         Mrs. Bissell's husband, Alfred E., died in 1975. She is survived by three daughters, Julia B. Leisenring of Berwyn, Pa., Antonia B. Laird of Chadds Ford and Susan B. Parker of Smith's Parish, Bermuda; a sister, Anne A. Black of Keswick, Va.; 15 grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Hanna Grunwald, a retired group psychotherapist and former director of Amnesty International U.S.A. in New York, died on May 15 at the Jewish Home for the Aged in Fairfield, Conn. She was 94 and had lived in Washington Heights until the late 1970's.         She had a long illness, Amnesty International said.         A native of Berlin, she received a doctorate at the University of Frankfurt and joined a resistance group shortly after the Nazis came to power in Germany in 1933. She and her husband, Marcus, managed to flee to France, where she played a role in helping thousands of homeless refugee children.         French authorities deported the couple, who then were interned in Casablanca, spent a harsh 22 months in the Dominican Republic and finally arrived in New York with their young son in 1944. Dr. Grunwald worked as a file clerk but was able to obtain a master's degree at the Columbia University Graduate School of Social Work with the help of her employer. 2d Career at Amnesty Group         She spent many years helping troubled youths through the Brooklyn Bureau of Social Service and other social-work agencies in the city. In the 1960's, she began to devote her evenings to volunteer work for Amnesty International.         She retired from her professional career in 1971 to join Amnesty and its board of directors, and led a group of local volunteers. She was named an honorary chairwoman of the organization in 1978, and later remained active at board meetings and in refugee committees.         Dr. Grunwald is survived by her son, George, of Benecia, Calif., and four grandchildren. Her husband died in 1949 after a long illness contracted in a concentration camp in Germany.       
         Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, the widow of President John F. Kennedy and of the Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, died of a form of cancer of the lymphatic system yesterday at her apartment in New York City. She was 64 years old.         Mrs. Onassis, who had enjoyed robust good health nearly all her life, began being treated for non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in early January and had been undergoing chemotherapy and other treatments in recent months while continuing her work as a book editor and her social, family and other personal routines.         But the disease, which attacks the lymph nodes, an important component of the body's immune system, grew progressively worse. Mrs. Onassis entered the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center for the last time on Monday but returned to her Fifth Avenue apartment on Wednesday after her doctors said there was no more they could do.         In recent years Mrs. Onassis had lived quietly but not in seclusion, working at Doubleday; joining efforts to preserve historic New York buildings; spending time with her son, daughter and grandchildren; jogging in Central Park; getting away to her estates in New Jersey, at Hyannis, Mass., and on Martha's Vineyard, and going about town with Maurice Tempelsman, a financier who had become her closest companion.         She almost never granted interviews on her past -- the last was nearly 30 years ago -- and for decades she had not spoken publicly about Mr. Kennedy, his Presidency or their marriage.         Mrs. Onassis was surrounded by friends and family since she returned home from the hospital on Wednesday. After she died at 10:15 P.M. on Thursday, Senator Edward M. Kennedy's office issued a statement saying: "Jackie was part of our family and part of our hearts for 40 wonderful and unforgettable years, and she will never really leave us."         President Clinton said he and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, spoke with Mrs. Onassis over the last several days and had been getting regular updates on her condition.         "She's been quite wonderful to my wife, to my daughter and to all of us," Mr. Clinton said.         Although she was one of the world's most famous women -- an object of fascination to generations of Americans and the subject of countless articles and books that re-explored the myths and realities of the Kennedy years, the terrible images of the President's 1963 assassination in Dallas, and her made-for-tabloids marriage to the wealthy Mr. Onassis -- she was a quintessentially private person, poised and glamorous, but shy and aloof.         They were qualities that spoke of her upbringing in the wealthy and fiercely independent Bouvier and Auchincloss families, of mansion life in East Hampton and Newport, commodious apartments in New York and Paris, of Miss Porter's finishing school and Vassar College and circles that valued a woman's skill with a verse-pen or a watercolor brush, at the reins of a chestnut mare or the center of a whirling charity cotillion.         She was only 23, working as an inquiring photographer for a Washington newspaper and taking in the capital night life of restaurants and parties, when she met John F. Kennedy, the young bachelor Congressman from Massachusetts, at a dinner party in 1952. She thought him quixotic after he told her he intended to become President.         But a year later, after Mr. Kennedy had won a seat in the United States Senate and was already being discussed as a Presidential possibility, they were married at Newport, R.I., in the social event of 1953, a union of powerful and wealthy Roman Catholic families whose scions were handsome, charming, trendy and smart. It was a whiff of American royalty.         And after Mr. Kennedy won the Presidency in 1960, there were a thousand days that seemed to raise up a nation mired in the cold war. There were babies in the White House for the first time in this century, and Jackie Kennedy, the vivacious young mother who showed little interest in the nuances of politics, busily transformed her new home into a place of elegance and culture.         She set up a White House fine arts commission, hired a White House curator and redecorated the mansion with early 19th Century furnishings, museum quality paintings and objets d'art, creating a sumptuous celebration of Americana that 56 million television viewers saw in 1961 as the First Lady, inviting America in, gave a guided tour broadcast by the three television networks. A Transformation At the White House         "She really was the one who made over the White House into a living stage -- not a museum -- but a stage where American history and art were displayed," said Hugh Sidey, who was a White House correspondent for Time magazine at the time. He said she told him: "I want to restore the White House to its original glory."         There was more. She brought in a French chef and threw elegant and memorable parties. The guest lists went beyond prime ministers and potentates to Nobel laureates and distinguished artists, musicians and intellectuals.         Americans gradually became familiar with the whispering, intimate quality of her voice, with the head scarf and dark glasses at the taffrail of Honey Fitz on a summer evening on the Potomac, with the bouffant hair and formal smile for the Rose Garden and the barefoot romp with her children on a Cape Cod beach.         There was an avalanche of articles and television programs on her fashion choices, her hair styles, her tastes in art, music and literature, and on her travels with the President across the nation and to Europe. On a visit to New York, she spoke Spanish in East Harlem and French in a Haitian neighborhood.         Arriving in France, a stunning understated figure in her pillbox hat and wool coat as she rode with the President in an open car, she enthralled crowds that chanted "Vive Jacqui" on the road to Paris, and later, in an evening gown at a dinner at Versailles, she mesmerized the austere Charles de Gaulle.         When the state visit ended, a bemused President Kennedy said: "I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris -- and I have enjoyed it."         But the images of Mrs. Kennedy that burned most deeply were those in Dallas on Nov. 22, 1963: her lunge across the open limousine as the assassin's bullets struck, the Schiaparelli pink suit stained with her husband's blood, her gaunt stunned face in the blur of the speeding motorcade, and the anguish later at Parkland Memorial Hospital as the doctors gave way to the priest and a new era.         In the aftermath, some things were not so readily apparent: her refusal to change clothes on the flight back to Washington to let Americans see the blood; her refusal to take sleeping pills that might dull her capacity to arrange the funeral, whose planning she dominated. She stipulated the riderless horse in the procession and the eternal flame by the grave at Arlington.         And in public, what the world saw was a figure of admirable self-control, a black-veiled widow who walked beside the coffin to the tolling drums with her head up, who reminded 3-year-old John Jr. to salute at the service and who looked with solemn dignity upon the proceedings. She was 34 years old.         A week later, it was Mrs. Kennedy who bestowed the epitaph of Camelot upon a Kennedy Presidency, which, while deeply flawed in the minds of many political analysts and ordinary citizens, had for many Americans come to represent something magical and mythical. It happened in an interview Mrs. Kennedy herself requested with Theodore H. White, the reporter-author and Kennedy confidant who was then writing for Life magazine.         The conversation, he said in a 1978 book, "In Search of History," swung between history and her husband's death, and while none of J.F.K.'s political shortcomings were mentioned -- stories about his liaisons with women were known only to insiders at the time -- Mrs. Kennedy seemed determined to "rescue Jack from all these 'bitter people' who were going to write about him in history."         She told him that the title song of the musical "Camelot" had become "an obsession with me" lately. She said that at night before bedtime, her husband had often played it, or asked her to play it, on an old Victrola in their bedroom. Mr. White quoted her as saying:         "And the song he loved most came at the very end of this record, the last side of Camelot, sad Camelot. . . . 'Don't let it be forgot, that once there was a spot, for one brief shining moment that was known as Camelot.'         ". . . There'll never be another Camelot again."         Mr. White recalled: "So the epitaph on the Kennedy Administration became Camelot -- a magic moment in American history, when gallant men danced with beautiful women, when great deeds were done, when artists, writers and poets met at the White House and the barbarians beyond the walls were held back."         But Mr. White, an admirer of Mr. Kennedy, added that her characterization was a misreading of history and that the Kennedy Camelot never existed, though it was a time when reason was brought to bear on public issues and the Kennedy people were "more often right than wrong and astonishingly incorruptible."         Five years later, with images of her as the grieving widow faded but with Americans still curious about her life and conduct, Mrs. Kennedy, who had moved to New York to be near family and friends and had gotten into legal disputes with photographers and writers portraying her activities, shattered her almost saintly image by announcing plans to marry Mr. Onassis.         It was a field day for the tabloids, a shock to members of her own family and a puzzlement to the public, given Camelot-Kennedy mystique. The prospective bridegroom was much shorter, and more than 28 years older, a canny businessman and not even American. Moreover, her brother-in-law, Robert Kennedy, had been assassinated earlier in the year, and the prospective marriage even posed a problem for the Vatican, which hinted that Mrs. Kennedy might become a public sinner. Negotiating A Marriage         There were additional unseemly details -- a prenuptial agreement that covered money and property and children. But they were married in 1968, and for a time the world saw a new, more outgoing Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But within a few years there were reported fights over money and other matters and accounts that each was being seen in the company of others.         While the couple was never divorced, the marriage was widely regarded as over long before Mr. Onassis died in 1975, leaving her a widow for the second time.         Jacqueline Bouvier was born on July 28, 1929, in East Hampton, L.I., to John Vernou Bouvier 3d and Janet Lee Bouvier. A sister, Caroline, known as Lee, was born four years later. From the beginning, the girls knew the trappings and appearances of considerable wealth. Their Long Island estate was called Lasata, an Indian word meaning place of peace. There was also a spacious family apartment at 765 Park Avenue, near 72d Street, in Manhattan.         Although the family lived well during the Depression, Mr. Bouvier's fortunes in the stock market rose and fell after huge losses in the crash of 1929. The marriage also foundered. In 1936, Mr. and Mrs. Bouvier separated, and their divorce became final in 1940.         In June 1942, Mrs. Bouvier married Hugh D. Auchincloss, who, like Mr. Bouvier, was a stockbroker. Mr. Auchincloss had been substantially better able to weather the Great Depression; his mother and benefactor was the former Emma Brewster Jennings, daughter of Oliver Jennings, a founder of Standard Oil with John D. Rockefeller.         From her earliest days, Jacqueline Bouvier attracted attention, as much for her intelligence as for her beauty. John H. Davis, a cousin who wrote "The Bouviers," a family history, in 1993, described her as a young woman who outwardly seemed to conform to social norms. But he wrote that she possessed a "fiercely independent inner life which she shared with few people and would one day be partly responsible for her enormous success."         Mr. Davis said Jacqueline "displayed an originality, a perspicacity," that set her apart, that she wrote credible verse, painted and became "an exceptionally gifted equestrienne." She also "possessed a mysterious authority, even as a teen-ager, that would compel people to do her bidding," he said.         Jacqueline seemed shy with individuals but would flower in large groups, dazzling people. "It was this watertight, interior suffisance, coupled with a need for attention, and corresponding love of being at center stage, which puzzled her relatives so and which in time would alternately charm and perplex the world," Mr. Davis wrote.         Her natural gifts could not save her from the effects of her parents' divorce, and after it occurred, Mr. Davis said, her relatives noticed her "tendency to withdraw frequently into a private world of her own."         John Vernou Bouvier Jr., her grandfather, wrote a history of the Bouvier family called "Our Forebears." The history indicates that the Bouviers were descended from French nobility. Stephen Birmingham, who wrote the biography "Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy Onassis" (Grosset & Dunlap), called the grandfather's book "a work of massive self-deception." Mr. Davis called it "a wishful history." From the documentation at hand, the Bouviers, who originated in southern France, had apparently been drapers, tailors, glovers, farmers and even domestic servants. The very name Bouvier means cowherd.         The family's original immigrant, Michel Bouvier, left a troubled France in 1815 after serving in Napoleon's defeated army and settled in Philadelphia. A man of considerable industry, he started as a handyman and later became a furniture manufacturer and, finally, a land speculator.         After the divorce, Jacqueline remained in touch with her father, but later she also spent a great deal of time with the Auchinclosses, who had a large estate in Virginia called Merrywood and another in Newport, R.I., called Hammersmith Farm. When she was 15, Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., an institution that in addition to its academic offerings emphasized good manners and the art of conversation. Its students simply called it Farmington.         She became popular with classmates as well as with young men who visited Farmington from Hotchkiss, Choate, St. Paul's and other elite preparatory schools in the Northeast. Her teachers regarded her as an outstanding girl, but she once fretted to a friend, "I'm sure no one will ever marry me, and I'll end up being a housemother at Farmington." When she graduated, her yearbook said her ambition in life was "not to be a housewife."         Just as Jacqueline picked Miss Porter's, she also picked Vassar College, which she entered in 1947, not long after she was named "Debutante of the Year" by Igor Cassini, who wrote for the Hearst newspapers under the byline Cholly Knickerbocker. He described her as a "regal brunette who has classic features and the daintiness of Dresden porcelain." He noted that the popular Miss Bouvier had "poise, is soft-spoken and intelligent, everything the leading debutante should be." Romance With Paris Starts in College         She did well at Vassar, especially in courses on the history of religion and Shakespeare, and made the dean's list. The late Charlotte Curtis, who became society editor of The New York Times and who was a student at Vassar with Miss Bouvier, once wrote that Miss Bouvier was not particularly thrilled with being in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and referred to her college as "that damned Vassar," even though the invitations continued to flow in from young men at Harvard, Yale, Princeton and other leading universities. In 1949, for her junior year, she decided to apply to a program at Smith College for a year studying in France.         She loved Paris, and when the year was up she decided not to return to Vassar to finish her bachelor's degree but to transfer to George Washington University in Washington. If this new institution lacked some of the elan and elegance of Vassar, its saving grace in her eyes was its location, in the capital. She received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University in 1951.         While she was finishing the work for her degree, she won Vogue magazine's Prix de Paris contest, with an essay on "People I Wish I Had Known," beating out 1,279 other contestants. Her subjects were Oscar Wilde, Charles Baudelaire and Sergei Diaghilev. Her victory entitled her to spend some time in Paris, writing about fashion for Vogue, but she was persuaded not to accept the prize.         C. David Heymann, author of "A Woman Named Jackie" (Lyle Stuart, 1989) said Hugh Auchincloss had feared that if Jacqueline had returned to Paris and stayed there for any length of time, she might not have ever returned to the United States. Her mother came to agree with him. They may have been right; Mrs. Onassis would later recall her stay in Paris as a young woman as "the high point in my life, my happiest and most carefree year."         In Washington, she met and was briefly engaged to John Husted, a stockbroker. Through her stepfather's contacts, she was able to get a job as a photographer at The Washington Times-Herald, earning $42.50 a week. At the paper, she was an inquiring photographer assigned to do a light feature in which people were asked about a topic of the day; their comments appeared with their photos. Among the questions she asked were: "Are men braver than women in the dental chair?" and, "Do you think a wife should let her husband think he's smarter than she is?"         She continued her work for The Washington Times-Herald and she enjoyed Washington's restaurants and parties. It was at one such party, given in May 1952 by Charles Bartlett, Washington correspondent for The Chattanooga Times, that she met Mr. Kennedy, who would soon capture the Senate seat held by Henry Cabot Lodge.         Some time afterward, they began seeing each other, and the courtship gathered momentum. In 1953, while she was in London on assignment, Mr. Kennedy called her and proposed. Their engagement was not immediately made public by the Kennedys who feared that it might have headed off a flattering article due to appear in the Saturday Evening Post entitled, "Jack Kennedy -- Senate's Gay Young Bachelor." The article appeared in the June 13 issue and the engagement was announced on June 25. They were married Sept. 12, 1953, at Hammersmith Farm in Newport.         John Bouvier, whose feelings about Mr. Auchincloss had been restrained, did not show up at the wedding, and the bride was given away by Mr. Auchincloss. The couple honeymooned in a villa overlooking Acapulco Bay in Mexico. She later wrote a long letter to her father, forgiving him, but he became withdrawn in the years that followed. He died in 1957.         In the late 1950's, Mrs. Kennedy confided to friends that she tired of listening to "all these boring politicians," Mr. Heymann wrote, but she did her duty as the wife of a Senator. There were trials in her personal life. In 1955 she suffered a miscarriage, and in 1956 she had a stillborn child by Caesarean section. Mr. Kennedy, who had only narrowly missed winning the Democratic Vice Presidential nomination in 1956, began to worry that they might not be able to have children. They moved into a rented Georgetown home after Mr. Kennedy sold his Virginia home to his brother, Robert. But in 1957 Caroline Bouvier Kennedy was born. Three years later she gave birth to John F. Kennedy Jr. A third child, Patrick Bouvier Kennedy, lived only 39 hours and died less than four months before President Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The Royal Aura Of the Kennedys         After Mr. Kennedy was elected President in 1960, the mystique and aura around Mrs. Kennedy began to grow rapidly, especially after she and her husband made the state visit to France in 1961.         Her elegance and fluency in French captured their hearts, and at a glittering dinner at Versailles she seemed to quite mesmerize President de Gaulle, a man not easy to mesmerize, as well as several hundred exuberant French people named Bouvier, all of them apparently claiming some sort of cousinhood. At a luncheon at the Elysee Palace, Theordore C. Sorensen wrote in "Kennedy" that President de Gaulle had turned to Mr. Kennedy and said, "Your wife knows more French history than any French woman."         Returning home by way of London, where she received more approbation, Mrs. Kennedy soon began to make her plans to redecorate the White House, a building that she found lacking in grace. She asked the advice of Henry Francis du Pont, curator of the Winterthur Museum in Wilmington, Del., and set about collecting authentic pieces from the early 1800's. She found some objects in the White House basement; others were donated by private citizens who, like Mrs. Kennedy, were interested in the project.         Some people said she went too far when she found some antique Zuber wallpaper on a wall in nearby Maryland, had it removed and rehung in the White House at a cost of $12,500, even though the original French printing blocks were still in existence and she could have had the same design on new paper for much less.         The social skills she acquired at East Hampton and Farmington were much in evidence. Her parties were nothing short of spectacular. When the president of Pakistan visited Washington, he heard an orchestra, took a boat ride, and had poulet chasseur, accompanied by couronne de riz Clamart and, for dessert, some framboises a la creme Chantilly at a table graced by silverware, glassware and china from Tiffany and Bonwit Teller.         Operatic and popular voices, the cello of Pablo Casals, string trios and quartets and whole orchestras filled the rooms with glorious sound.         "I think she cast a particular spell over the White House that has not been equaled," said Benjamin C. Bradlee, former executive editor of The Washington Post, who was a friend of the Kennedys. "She was young. My God, she was young. She had great taste, a sense of culture, an understanding of art. She brought people like Andre Malraux to the White House who never would have gone there. As personalities, they really transformed the city."         Letitia Baldridge, who was Mrs. Kennedy's chief of staff and social secretary in the White House, remembered her sense of humor. "She had such a wit. She would have been terrible if she hadn't been so funny. She imitated people, heads of state, after everyone had left a White House dinner. Their accents, the way the talked. She was a cutup. Behind the closed doors, she'd dance a jig."         Before she left the White House, she placed a plaque in the Lincoln bedroom that said, "In this room lived John Fitzgerald Kennedy with his wife, Jacqueline, during the 2 years, 10 months and 2 days he was President of the United States -- Jan. 10, 1961 - Nov. 22, 1963." Mrs. Richard M. Nixon had the plaque removed after she and her husband moved in in 1969.         To some, Jacqueline Kennedy seemed to fall from grace as her year of mourning ended. She was photographed wearing a miniskirt; she was escorted to lunch and dinner and various social gatherings by prominent bachelors, including Frank Sinatra, Marlon Brando and Mike Nichols; she toured the Seville Fair on horseback in 1966 and, in a crimson jacket and a rakish broad-brimmed black hat, tossed down a glass of sherry. "I know," she said, "that to visit Sevilla and not ride horseback at the fair is equal to not coming at all." To some Americans she was no longer just the grieving widow of their martyred President; she was young, attractive and she clearly wanted to live her life with a certain brio.         But Mrs. Kennedy found she also needed more privacy. The more private she became the more curious the public seemed about her conduct. New Yorkers might be considered the most private of all Americans; urban apartment-dwelling grants anonymity to those who seek it. And so she moved to New York in 1964 to an apartment at 1040 Fifth Avenue. It was near the homes of family and friends and also not far from the Convent of the Sacred Heart at 91st Street and Fifth Avenue, where Caroline was to attend school.         New York was not all she had hoped it would be. For one thing, the photographer Ron Galella seemed to be everywhere she went, taking thousands of photographs of her.  The preparation and publication of "The Death of a President," William Manchester's detailed account of the assassination of President Kennedy, turned into an unexpected battle for Mrs. Kennedy that may have cost her some popularity.         Mr. Manchester, whose work was admired by President Kennedy, asked for and received permission from the Kennedy family to do an authorized, definitive work on the assassination. His publisher, Harper & Row, agreed to turn over most of their profits to the Kennedy Library. Mrs. Kennedy, in a rare departure form her usual practice, agreed to be interviewed. Although Mr. Manchester did not stand to profit from the book itself, he did arrange to have it serialized in Look Magazine, starting in the summer of 1966, for which he would be paid $665,000. Long Fight For Privacy         Mrs. Kennedy became angry. From her perspective, Mr. Manchester was commercially exploiting her husband's assassination. At one point, she tried to get an injunction in New York State Supreme Court to stop the publication of the book, either by Look or by Harper & Row. The case was settled in 1967, with Mr. Manchester agreeing to pay a large share of his earnings to the Kennedy Library.         Mrs. Onassis never created an oral history, associates said, and her refusal to give interviews has left little for the record that she would have approved. Tapes of two interviews with her -- Mr. White's shortly after the assassination in Dallas and Mr. Manchester's for his book "Death of a President" -- are kept under seal at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library in Boston.         Mr. Manchester's interview, 313 minutes on tape, was sealed for 100 years and is scheduled to be opened in 2067. The interview by Mr. White is to be unsealed a year after Mrs. Onassis's death. William Johnson, chief archivist at the library, said he believes the interviews contain material that the authors did not use in their books and might prove useful to historians.         Her silence about her past, especially about the Kennedy years and her marriage to the President, was always something of a mystery. Her family never spoke of it; out of loyalty or trepidation over her wrath, her closest friends shed no light on it and there was nothing authoritative to be learned beyond her inner circle.         The next year, Mr. Onassis and Mrs. Kennedy announced that they would be married. It had been five years since the President's death. She told a friend, "You don't know how lonely I've been." The ceremony was held on Oct. 20, 1968. She then became Mistress of Skorpios, the Aegean island that Mr. Onassis owned, and held sway over a palace with more than 70 servants on call. There were four other locations where he had homes. Mr. Davis observed that immediately after her marriage, Mrs. Onassis became more cheerful and outgoing but it was not to last. Within a few years, there were reports that Mr. and Mrs. Onassis were arguing. He was again seen in Paris, dining at Maxim's with the soprano Maria Callas. Mrs. Onassis was seen in New York in the company of other escorts.         Mr. Onassis issued a public statement that did little to dampen the rumor-mongering. "Jackie is a little bird that needs its freedom as well as its security and she gets them both from me," he said. "She can do exactly as she pleases -- visit international fashion shows and travel and go out with friends to the theater or anyplace. And I, of course, will do exactly as I please. I never question her and she never questions me."         The marriage continued to founder. Mr. Onassis persuaded the Greek Parliament to pass legislation to prevent her from getting the 25 percent portion of his estate that Greek law reserved for widows. When he died in 1975, his daughter Christina was at his side; Mrs. Onassis was in New York. There was a lawsuit and when it was settled, she received $20 million -- far less than the $125 million or more that she might have received.         Mrs. Onassis's began her career in publishing in 1975, when her friend Thomas Guinzburg, then the president of Viking Press, offered her a job as a consulting editor. But she resigned two years later after Mr. Guinzburg published -- without telling her, she said later -- a thriller by Jeffrey Archer called "Shall We Tell the President," which imagined that her brother-in-law, Senator Edward M. Kennedy, was President of the United States and described an assassination plot against him.         In 1978, Mrs. Onassis then took a new job as an associate editor at Doubleday under another old friend, John Sargent, and was installed at first in a small office with no windows. It helped, she said, that Nancy Tuckerman, who had been her social secretary at the White House, already had a job there; the two worked closely for the next 15 years.         At Doubleday, where she was eventually promoted to senior editor, Mrs. Onassis was known as a gracious and unassuming colleague who had to pitch her stories at editorial meetings, just as everyone else did. She avoided the industry's active social scene, probably because she had so little need to expand her network of contacts. She often ate lunch at her desk, for instance, avoiding the publishing lunchtime crowd at restaurants like the Four Seasons and 44. She worked three days a week -- Doubleday never revealed what days they were, for fear the information would attract celebrity-watchers -- and took long vacations in Martha's Vineyard every summer.         But she was very productive, editing 10 to 12 books a year on performing arts and other subjects. Books she published included Bill Moyers's "Healing and the Mind"; Michael Jackson's "Moonwalk"; and Edvard Radzinsky's "The Last Tsar: The Life and Death of Nicholas II." Her list also testified to her eclectic tastes and to her first-rate contacts. She published a number of children's books by the singer Carly Simon, a friend and Martha's Vineyard neighbor. Her love of Egypt inspired her, among other things, to bring the Cairo Trilogy, "Palace Walk," "Palace of Desire" and "Sugar Street" by Naguib Mahfouz, the Nobel Prize winner from Egypt, to Doubleday, where they were published in translation.  Admiration From Her Writers         In an industry where editors often have little time for their authors, Mrs. Onassis's spoke admiringly of her curiosity, her interest in their work and her great attention to detail. "Working with her was extraordinary," said Jonathan Cott, a contributing editor at Rolling Stone who has published several books on Egypt with Mrs. Onassis, the most recent being "Isis and Osiris: Rediscovering the Goddess Myth."         It seemed daunting to work with an editor who was also a public figure, but Mr. Cott said he was soon put at his ease. In editing sessions at Mrs. Onassis's home and office, he said, she would make notations on every page of his manuscript, drawing from her own knowledge of Egypt and her extensive collection of Egyptian literature and history books. "She had an incredible sense of literary style and structure," he said. "She was intelligent and passionate about the material; she was an ideal reader and an ideal editor."         John Russell, a former art critic for The New York Times and a longtime friend of Mrs. Onassis, remembered her as a shrewd judge of people, but one who was always mindful of their feelings and was careful not to hurt them if her judgments were negative.         "She had an absolutely unfailing antenna for the fake and the fraud in people," he said. "She never showed it when meeting people, but afterwards she had quite clearly sized people up. She never in public let people know she did not like them. People always went away thinking, 'She quite liked me, yes, she was impressed by me.' It was a very endearing quality."         Mrs. Onassis gave a rare to Publishers Weekly, the industry trade magazine, and it was on the subject of publishing. She agreed to the interview, Mrs. Onassis told the reporter, only on the condition that he use no tape recorder, take no photographs and ask no questions about her personal life. In the interview, in typically self-deprecating style, she said she had joined the profession because of a simple love of books. "One of the things I like about publishing is that you don't promote the editor -- you promote the book and the author," she said.         In the years following Mr. Onassis's death, she built a 19-room house on 375 acres of ocean-front land on Martha's Vineyard. She spent considerable time there, as well as in Bernardsville, N.J., where she rented a place and rode horses.         Mrs. Onassis did not marry again. In the last few years, Mr. Tempelsman, a Belgian born industrialist and diamond merchant, had been her frequent companion. The couple, who met about seven years ago, summered together on Martha's Vineyard and visited her horse farm. She told a friend that she admired his "strength and his success."         Mrs. Onassis is survived by her daughter, Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg; a son, John F. Kennedy Jr.; her sister, Lee Radziwill Ross, and three grandchildren, Rose Kennedy, Tatiana Celia Kennedy and John Bouvier Kennedy Schlossberg.         DEATH OF A FIRST LADY       
         Louise Troy, a tall and elegant actress who was praised for performances in Broadway musicals, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60.         The cause was breast cancer, said Larry Keith, a friend.         Miss Troy was applauded for what critics called her sprightly, winning, handsome and vivid performance as Edward Woodward's impatient second wife in the 1964 musical "High Spirits," based on Noel Coward's comedy "Blithe Spirit."         "I lose three pounds a performance," she told an interviewer at the time, and her efforts won her a Tony Award nomination.         Miss Troy also received Tony nominations for her acting in the 1963 musical "Tovarich" and the 1966 musical "Walking Happy."         She had already won recognition for her acting in a 1954 production of Jean Cocteau's play "The Infernal Machine." One critic said she was able to take a classical play in stride without the solecisms familiar in the work of amateurs trained only for realism. Rarely Idle         From 1974 through 1980, Miss Troy had starring roles in a dozen plays, including Coward's "Private Lives" and Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya." She also appeared in regional theater over the years.         In addition, she appeared in a number of television series, including "The Defenders," "Hogan's Heroes," Room 222," "The Odd Couple" and "Kate and Allie." She also acted in the 1968 films "Yours, Mine and Ours" and "The Swimmer."         Miss Troy, who was born in Manhattan, studied acting at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts and with Lee Strasberg.         Her 1969 marriage to Werner Klemperer, an actor, ended in divorce in 1974.         She is survived by her second husband, Douglas Seale, who is an actor and stage director.         A funeral service is scheduled for Monday at 11 A.M. at Grace Church, Broadway and 10th Street in Manhattan.       
         Harriet Gans, a photographer who showed her work in New York galleries and museums, died on Wednesday at her home in Scarsdale, N.Y. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A native of Manhattan, Ms. Gans was a graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, and held a master's in psychology from Columbia University. At her death she was a professor of photography at Pace University.         She had solo exhibitions at the Julie Saul and Pindar Galleries in New York. She contributed studies of flowers to the In Bloom Traveling Exhibit at the Museum of Modern Art in 1990.         She was a regular contributor to magazines and The New York Times.         She is survived by her husband, Walter Gans; two sons, David of Scarsdale and Erik of Cambridge, Mass., and her mother, Mildred Goldhagen of Deerfield Beach, Fla.       
         Anni Albers, a leading textile artist of the 20th century, died yesterday at her home in Orange, Conn., near New Haven. She was the widow of the abstract artist Josef Albers and was 94 years old.         Mrs. Albers was cured of lymphoma 20 years ago and died of old age, said Dr. Samuel Bobrow, her physician.         "From her earliest days as a student and master at the Bauhaus in the 1920's, Anni Albers was an explorer and form giver in textiles," said Jack Lenor Larsen, the New York designer and textile producer. "And in America, she continued in her role as a prophet, teacher and innovative weaver."  A Reluctant Weaver         Mrs. Albers was the last surviving teacher at the Bauhaus, the German design school founded at Weimar in 1919, and closed by the Nazis in 1933. When she enrolled as a student at the Bauhaus in 1922, she hoped to study wall painting but became a weaver reluctantly, when no other workshop was available.         After she received her diploma in 1930, Mrs. Albers and her husband, whom she had met at the Bauhaus and married in 1925, stayed on as teachers, he in design, she as a part-time instructor in textiles and as the acting director of the weaving workshop. When the Bauhaus moved to Berlin in 1932, they moved with it, and Josef Albers continued teaching while Mrs. Albers worked privately as a weaver.         In 1933, after the Gestapo had padlocked the doors of the Bauhaus, Mrs. Albers met the architect Philip Johnson, then at the Museum of Modern Art, who was visiting Berlin and asked her if she and her husband wished to come to the United States. On his return to New York, he spoke with Edward Warburg, the art patron, who was assisting the founders of the Black Mountain College in North Carolina, a progressive school of the arts.  A Solo Exhibition         Though they spoke no English, and did not know where North Carolina was, the Alberses went. From 1933 to 1939, she was an assistant professor of art at Black Mountain. In 1949, she became the first weaver to have a solo exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art, the museum which owns the finest collection of her works.         Mrs. Albers's textiles reflected the Abstract style in painting in their geometric patterns and complex weaves. She used knotting and intertwining of linked threads to enrich the texture of her works. She also designed fabrics for Knoll International. Her 1926 designs for rugs are now being produced by Larsen Carpet. And her 1950's books, "On Weaving" and "On Designing," are considered a must for enthusiasts and students of design.         When she was 70, Mrs. Albers gave up weaving and became a printmaker, at which she was prolific for more than a decade. She produced many editions for Tamarind Lithography Workshop and Gemini G.E.L., both of Los Angeles, and Tyler Graphics of Mount Kisco, N.Y.  A Cameo Role         In her 80's, she made her debut in films in 1984, playing a cameo role looking at unedited film, in Maximilian Schell's "Marlene."         Born in Berlin and named Annelise Fleischmann, she was the daughter of a prosperous furniture manufacturer. Mrs. Albers began her art studies as a teen-ager studying drawing and painting with Martin Brandenburg, an impressionist painter. She also attended the School of Applied Art in Hamburg before going to the Bauhaus.         She is survived by her brother, Hans Farman of Old Greenwich, Conn.       
         Lois G. Forer, an author, a retired Philadelphia judge and a lifelong advocate for the young, the elderly and the poor, died on Monday at Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. A Philadelphia resident, she was 80.         The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, her family said.         Judge Forer, an authority on criminal justice, spent 32 years practicing law and 16 years on the bench. Her books on the law received critical acclaim nationally.         She also headed a poverty law office for children, sat on the board of the American Civil Liberties Union and represented poor people in constitutional cases. As a private lawyer, she worked for wealthy clients and corporations, and as a judge she tried both criminal and civil cases. Benchmark Cases         From 1955 to 1966, she served Pennsylvania as Deputy Attorney General and played a key role in two benchmark cases. One of them ended the whites-only policy that the founder of Girard College had written into his will. The other opened the celebrated art collection of the tax-exempt Barnes Foundation to the public.         She became a judge of the Court of Common Pleas in Philadelphia in 1971 and retired as a senior judge in 1987.         Lois Goldstein Forer was born in Chicago and graduated from Northwestern University in 1935. She worked briefly as a reporter and then as a union organizer. Dissatisfied, she returned to Northwestern for a law degree and spent several years in public service in Washington before moving to Philadelphia as a law clerk in Federal Court.         After her stint as Deputy Attorney General in 1966, she organized the Office for Juveniles at Community Legal Services and headed it for nearly two years.         Judge Forer received national attention with her first book, "No One Will Lissen: How Our Legal System Brutalizes the Youthful Poor" (1970). In it, she argued that the humane ideal to treat juveniles differently had been mangled in practice. For the most part, she wrote, juveniles falling into the system are poor, nonwhite and defenseless.         Her "Criminals and Victims: A Trial Judge Reflects on Crime and Punishment" (1980) tried to make sense of seeking to mete out justice in an environment of abstract theories of the way things are supposed to be. A judge, she asserted, finds little in the way of either practical guidance or spiritual comfort from abstractions.) Critical Views on Justice         "Money and Justice: Who Owns the Courts?" (1984) describes a system that costs too much and takes too long and often results in "substantial injustice." "A Chilling Effect: The Mounting Threat of Libel and Invasion of Privacy Actions to the First Amendment" (1987) argued for definitions of what is libelous and what is newsworthy. Federal legislation to that end would help rid the First Amendment of the ballast a litigious society has heaped on it, she contended.         Since her fourth-stage lymphoma was diagnosed eight months ago, Judge Forer finished two more books. One, "What Every Woman Should Know Before (and After) She Gets Involved With Men and Money," is scheduled for publication by MacMillan later this year.         Her highly topical last book, "The Rage to Punish: The Unintended Consequences of Mandatory Sentencing," is on W. W. Norton's list for next month.         Judge Forer is survived by her husband, Morris L. Forer; two sons, Stuart, of Warwick, R.I., and John, of Philadelphia; a daughter, Hope Forer Ross of Manhattan; a sister, Marion Schott of Mount Kisco, N.Y., and two grandsons.         Correction:  May 14, 1994, Saturday         An obituary on Wednesday about Lois G. Forer, author and retired Philadelphia judge, referred incorrectly to the publication of her book "What Every Woman Needs to Know Before (and After) She Gets Involved With Men and Money." The publication, by Macmillan, is not due later this year; it occurred in February.       
         Dorothy Bernstein, a trustee and president of the auxiliary of the Maimonides Medical Center in Brooklyn from 1972 to 1990, died yesterday at her home in Bellport, L.I. She was 80.         The cause was complications from a stroke, said her son, Herbert Bernstein.         Mrs. Bernstein was active in community health programs in Brooklyn and in 1982 was given the Mayor's Volunteer Action Award for her work in health education and preventive medicine. She organized symposiums on nutrition, hypertension and nursing.         For more than 40 years she also served as the office manager for her husband, Dr. David Bernstein, a surgeon who practiced medicine in Brooklyn until his death in 1988. Mrs. Bernstein graduated from Brooklyn College in 1935.         She is survived by her son of Bellport; a daughter, Helen Young of Lawrenceville, N.J., and three grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Birdsall Burdick, the founding director of the International Theater Institute Library in New York, died last Friday at St. Luke's Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         She had a heart attack in her home, her family said.         A native of Haddonville, N.J., Mrs. Burdick graduated from Wellesley College and the Yale Drama School. She began her career as a production secretary on Broadway.         In 1969, she founded and organized the library for the institute and served as its archivist and curator until her retirement in 1988. The library holds resource materials from 146 countries and about 13,000 foreign play scripts.         Mrs. Burdick is survived by her husband, John; two sons, Owen of Jersey City and Richard of Manhattan; her brother, Robert Birdsall of Haddonfield, and two grandchildren.       
         Arden Fingerhut, a prolific designer for the theater whose lighting and stage effects highlighted dozens of Broadway productions in the last 20 years, died yesterday at the North Adams Regional Hospital in North Adams, Mass. She was 48 and lived in Pownal, Vt.         The cause was breast cancer, said her husband, Dennis McHugh.         Arden Fingerhut designed the lighting for such major productions as "Da," "Bent," "Hay Fever," "Plenty" and "Driving Miss Daisy." She sometimes had as many as 20 productions on the boards in one theater season.         In addition to Broadway and Off Broadway theater, she designed the lighting for regional companies, including the Long Wharf Theater in New Haven and the Williamstown (Mass.) Theater Festival.         Her work with the New York Shakespeare Festival included the 1988 productions of "Julius Caesar" and "King John."         In 1982 she received an Obie Award for sustained excellence in lighting design.         She was a professor of theater and a former chairman of the theater department at Williams College, a trustee of the Williamstown Theater Festival and a director of the Theater Communications Group in New York.         In addition to Mr. McHugh, a daughter, Maude Mikulewicz of Pownal, survives.       
         Helen Bruce Baldwin, the widow of Hanson W. Baldwin, former military-affairs editor of The New York Times, died on Saturday at her home in Roxbury, Conn. She was 87.         Mrs. Baldwin, a native of Urbana, Ohio, wrote poetry and articles on culinary subjects for various magazines. She is survived by two daughters, Barbara Potter of Woodbury, Conn., and Elizabeth Crabtree of Midland Park, N.J.; a sister, Elizabeth B. Ultes of Columbus, Ohio; seven grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren. Her husband, a Pulitzer Prize-winning war correspondent of World War II, died in 1991.       
         Herva Nelli, an Italian-born soprano who became a professional cook when her singing career ended, died yesterday at the Sharon Country Manor in Sharon, Conn. She was 85.         Her sister, Delfa, said the cause was leukemia.         Miss Nelli, a solid, able singer who was often called "the Toscanini soprano" because of her seven-year association with the conductor, was reared in Pittsburgh and made her debut in 1937 with the Salmaggi Opera in New York City. In 1947, after she sang in a concert version of "Otello" with Arturo Toscanini and the NBC Symphony, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times that the timbre and quality of her voice "most touchingly communicated Desdemona's gentleness and purity of soul."         Over the next seven years she sang with the orchestra in several Verdi operas and went to Italy with Toscanini for the postwar reopening of La Scala opera house.         She made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1953 in "Aida" and sang many leading roles there. Her final performance was in 1962, in "Norma" at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.         Miss Nelli and her husband opened a restaurant near Poughkeepsie, N.Y., in 1955. In 1970, after their divorce, she started to cater meals for a country club, then became a cook for Stephen and Jean Kennedy Smith.  She is survived by her sister, of Wingdale, N.Y.       
         Yvonne Istel, a volunteer worker during World Wars I and II on both sides of the Atlantic, died on Saturday in Paris. She was 99.         Mrs. Istel was honored for her service by President Reagan, by Mayor Edward I. Koch and by the Government of France. In World War I, she was active in an organization in France aiding prisoners of war. In the 1940's, as a resident of New York, she played a role in American Aid to France. She also did volunteer work for the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York.         Her husband, Andre Istel, an investment banker in Paris and New York, died in 1966 at the age of 78 when the couple lived on the Upper East Side. She is survived by their two sons, Jacques-Andre and Yves-Andre; six grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Nadia Gray, an actress best known for her performance in Federico Fellini's 1961 film "La Dolce Vita," in which she did a striptease to entertain a roomful of bored party guests, died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said Henry R. Silverman, her stepson.         Ms. Gray, who often played elegant, aristocratic women, had her first big break in the theater when Noel Coward made her his co-star in the Paris production of his play "Present Laughter." Her success in that role brought her offers from British film makers. She subsequently appeared in "The Spider and the Fly" (1952) with Eric Portman, "Night Without Stars" (1953) with David Farrar and "Mr. Topaze" (1961) with Peter Sellers.         She went on to make films in France, Italy and the United States. Among her other screen credits are "La Parisienne" (1958) with Charles Boyer, "Candide" (1962) with Jean-Pierre Cassel, "The Crooked Road" (1965) with Robert Ryan, "The Naked Runner" (1967) with Frank Sinatra and "Two for the Road" (1967) with Audrey Hepburn.         Ms. Gray also had a career as a singer, appearing in clubs and on television and radio shows in the United States and abroad.         In addition to her stepson, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, Herbert R. Silverman, and a stepdaughter, Karen Mayers of Washington.       
         Sally Milgrim, a designer of women's apparel who with her husband, Charles, owned the Milgrim fashion store on 57th Street for many years, died on Saturday at St. Francis Barry Nursing and Rehabilitative Center in Miami. She was 103 years old.         Mrs. Milgrim began as a custom designer on the Lower East Side in Manhattan in the early 1920's, moved briefly to Broadway and 72d Street and in 1927 opened the store on 57th Street near Fifth Avenue, where it became one of the area's best-known custom and specialty stores from the 1930's through the 1950's. The Milgrim shop emphasized quality dresses that were ready to wear at a time when high fashion was still a world of made-to-order styles and custom-made tailored suits.         One of Mrs. Milgrim's best-known designs was a light blue gown worn by Eleanor Roosevelt to her husband's first inaugural ball, in 1933.  Mrs. Milgrim also made dresses for the entertainers Marilyn Miller, Ethel Merman, Pearl White, Mary Pickford and others.         At one point there were also Milgrim stores in Detroit, Cleveland, Columbus, Chicago, East Orange, N.J., White Plains, Miami and Palm Beach. Mrs. Milgrim also sold a wholesale dress collection to stores throughout the country.         She retired in 1960. Her husband died in 1967. The last Milgrim store, in Cleveland, was closed in 1990.         Mrs. Milgrim is survived by two sons, Franklin of Miami and Paul of Detroit, a brother, Louis Knobel of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Nitze Paepcke, who played a central role in transforming Aspen, Colo., from a largely abandoned 19th-century mining town into a winter resort, died on Wednesday at her home in Aspen. She was 91.         She died of complications from a head injury she suffered in a fall last weekend, her family said.         Mrs. Paepcke (pronounced PEP-keh) collaborated with -- and often inspired -- her husband, Walter, a Chicago industrialist, in the development of what was nearly a ghost town by the 1940's. Mr. Paepcke bought about half the town, then proceeded to rebuild it.         The Paepckes helped open the International Design Conference in Aspen, the Aspen Music Festival and the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies. Mrs. Paepcke also founded the Aspen Center for Environmental Studies. Goethe Festival in 1949         Modern Aspen was put on the cultural map in 1949 when Mr. Paepcke engaged the Budapest String Quartet for a concert to celebrate his wife's birthday. This led to the Goethe Bicentennial Festival, also in 1949, with Albert Schweitzer, the theologian, musician and medical missionary in Africa, making his only visit to the United States to address the festival at Mrs. Paepcke's suggestion.         "In most ways Aspen is Elizabeth Paepcke," said David McLaughlin, president of the Aspen Institute, which holds seminars for leaders from various fields in the United States and overseas. "She and Walter created the institutions that gave vision and vitality to the community."         Mrs. Paepcke was born in Baltimore and as a young woman worked as an interior designer in Chicago. She first saw Aspen while on a skiing vacation in 1938, when it had no amenities like ski runs or lifts.         Once a rich silver-mining town with a population of 15,000, Aspen was largely dilapidated in the 1930's, but its natural setting and faded charm caused her to return in 1946 with her husband.         Aspen, in west-central Colorado just west of the Sawatch Range of the Rocky Mountains, now has a year-round population of about 5,000. In recent years, Mrs. Paepcke expressed some disenchantment with the direction Aspen's "renaissance" had taken, with its emphasis on wealth and celebrity and its proliferation of boutiques and ski resorts.         Mr. Paepcke, who headed the Container Corporation of America, died in 1960 at the age of 63.         Mrs. Paepcke is survived by three daughters, Anina Hamilton of Sussex, England, Paula Zurcher of Woodside, Calif., and Antonia DuBrul of Manhattan; a brother, Paul H. Nitze of Washington, the longtime United States arms negotiator who is now retired; eight grandchildren, and two great-granddaughters.       
         Billie Leibowitz Kotlowitz, an administrator at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 67 and lived on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Robert Kotlowitz.         Mrs. Kotlowitz was for a decade, until her death, the executive director of the college's thematic studies program, an undergraduate program in the liberal arts. The program was founded in 1972 to demonstrate the links between history, literature and other fields in the humanities.         Mrs. Kotlowitz became the first counselor on the program's staff in 1973 after earning a master's degree in academic and personal counseling from the Bank Street College of Education in 1972.         In the early 1980's, she became its executive director while continuing to provide academic and personal counseling to students. She also directed classes about alcohol and drug problems, among other roles at the college.         A native of Baltimore, she graduated from Goucher College there in 1949.         In addition to her husband, a novelist and a former editor and executive of WNET, she is survived by two sons, Daniel, a theatrical-lighting designer, of Manhattan, and Alex, an author, of Oak Park Ill., and a sister, Peggy L. Snyder of Manhattan.       
         Frances Corey, a fashion executive whose career of six decades began before the era of the flappers and took in space-age fabrics developed for astronauts, died on Thursday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, said Keven Bellows of Los Angeles, a family friend.         Ms. Corey's working life began at the age of 19 when she opened a bookstore in the Annex of the Marshall Field department store in Chicago. She subsequently became director of fashion and advertising for Bloomingdale's in New York.         Moving to Los Angeles in 1943, she was named sales-promotion and advertising manager of the May Company. She returned to New York in 1953 to join R. H. Macy & Company as an executive vice president -- the first woman to rise to that executive level at Macy's.         Ms. Corey moved back to California in 1960 to head the West Coast office of Grey Advertising. Over the years, she also served as senior vice president of Catalina, a sportswear company based in Los Angeles, and as a merchandising and marketing consultant for Bullock's department stores.         The space age entered her career when she was engaged as a consultant by a center at the University of Southern California that evaluated products developed for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. She advised the center about the commercial potential of the products and, with her husband, George Corey, founded Environmental Concepts Products to market them.         In the 1970's and 1980's, she was associated with the Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising in Los Angeles, lecturing and meeting weekly with students for career counseling. At a luncheon held in 1982 in a hall named after her, the institute honored her for her contributions.         In 1956, Fortune magazine ranked her among the top businesswomen in the United States, and she won the National Retail Merchants Gold Medal for retailing twice.         Ms. Corey is survived by a daughter, Mary Corey, and a granddaughter, both of Beverly Hills. Her husband died last year.       
         Mary Anne Devanna, an associate dean at the Columbia University Business School, died on Saturday at her home in Ardsley, N.Y. She was 55.         The cause was leukemia, said Maryann Hedaa, an associate professor at the business school.         Dr. Devanna earned her Ph.D. in human resources management from the Columbia Business School in 1982. Beginning in 1988, she was named a research professor and an associate dean, becoming one of the highest-ranking women at the school.         Previously, she was director of executive education at the school and, earlier, an advertising executive.         She was co-author of the book "The Transformational Leader: Molding Tomorrow's Corporate Winners," published in 1986. She was also the author or co-author of several other books and wrote numerous articles for journals in the human resource management field.         Dr. Devanna was born in Jersey City and received a bachelor's degree from St. John's University in 1960 and a master's degree in business administration from the Columbia Business School in 1974.         She is survived by her husband, Ralph; a son, Joseph R., of Boston; two daughters, Eva M. Grizell of Boston and Nichole Devanna of Ardsley; two grandchildren, and a sister, Barbara Schwab of Mount Laurel, N.J.       
         Rosemarie Brancato Rothman, a coloratura soprano, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Dr. Peter M. Rothman.         Mrs. Rothman, who used her maiden name in performance, made her debut with the Chicago Civic Opera in 1934, as Gilda in "Rigoletto." She sang with the Cincinnati Summer Opera and made nationwide concert tours. She made her New York City Opera debut in 1946, as Violetta in "La Traviata" and was heard regularly on the radio. She later sang leading roles with the Detroit Civic Light Opera and at the Paper Mill Playhouse in Millburn, N.J.         In addition to her son, of Fort Wayne, Ind., she is survived by her husband, Dr. Lester D. Rothman; a brother, Matthew, and a sister, Josephine Bono, both of Kansas City, and a grandson, Wilson J. Rothman.       
         Fiona Baan, the director of dressage and driving programs for the United States Equestrian Team, died on Sunday at her home in Chester, N.J. She was 55.         The cause was cancer, a team spokeswoman said.         Mrs. Baan was responsible for training this country's international teams in driving and dressage and coordinated national championships from which the United States Olympic team was selected.         In the international sport of driving, either four or two horses are guided by one driver in a carriage. In dressage, a rider controls a horse through a series of intricate movements. A Bronze Medal         A highlight of her career came in 1992 at the Barcelona Olympics when the American dressage squad took the bronze after 16 years without an Olympic medal in that competition.         Mrs. Baan's job covered all aspects of administering the two disciplines for the United States Equestrian Team, with headquarters in Gladstone, N.J. She managed the teams for the North American Dressage Championships in 1985 and 1989; the 1986 World Dressage Championships, and the 1989 and 1991 Pairs World Driving Championships.         She managed the 1989, 1990 and 1991 Olympic dressage teams and served as chef d'equipe, or team manager, for the dressage team at the 1987 Pan American Games. In 1991, she helped organize the Equestrian Team's Festival of Champions, having previously set up dressage championships and selection trials at Gladstone.         Born in Scotland, Mrs. Baan took up riding in the Cotswolds in England. She became versed in all its sports aspects, including dressage and show jumping. She entered the hotel business and worked in England, Bermuda, Florida and Nevada before settling in New Jersey.         She hunted with the hounds and successfully competed herself while working for the Equestrian Team. She began with the team in 1966 as a secretary.         Mrs. Baan is survived by her husband, Leslie, and a daughter, Natalie.       
         Marie Janis Emery, who directed school programs countrywide for exceptional and gifted American Indian children before she retired from the Bureau of Indian Affairs last month, died on Tuesday at her home in Centreville, Va. She was 64.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         Mrs. Emery, an Oglala Sioux, spent 37 years in public service. She joined the bureau, a division of the Interior Department, in 1979 and most recently headed the branch that allocates money for exceptional pupils attending Indian schools.         She was born on the Pine Ridge Reservation in the Badlands of South Dakota and received her undergraduate education at Bacone College in Muskogee, Okla. She studied education at Black Hills State College in Spearfish, S.D., graduating with honors, and took graduate courses at universities in the Midwest.         In 1950, Mrs. Emery became the first member of the Oglala Sioux tribe to teach elementary school among the Oglalas. She taught at Indian schools in South Dakota and Montana until 1970, when she was recruited as an administrator of educational programs for what was then the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The programs she oversaw broke new ground in bilingual classroom instruction.         Transferred to Washington as an education specialist in 1974, she administered bilingual and other programs designed for Indian children. This led to her move to the Bureau of Indian Affairs in 1979. At the time of her retirement last month she was the acting chief of the Branch of Exceptional Education, an office set up to benefit both disabled and especially talented children.         Mrs. Emery is survived by her husband of 40 years, Charles E.; three daughters, Roxane G. Holmes and Jamie N. Emery, both of Centreville, and Robin E. Loring of Virginia Beach, Va.; three sons, Charles R., of Fayetteville, N.C., Randy B., of Centreville, and Ronald H., of Stafford, Va.; a brother, Sylvestor Janis of Kyle, S.D., and eight grandchildren.       
         Phyllis J. Shorenstein, a founder of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco, died on Wednesday at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center. She was 76 and lived in San Francisco.         Mrs. Shorenstein had a heart ailment and died after a long illness, doctors said.         The wife of Walter Shorenstein, a national real estate developer, Mrs. Shorenstein was also a substantial contributor to local charities and universities.         Mayor Frank Jordan of San Francisco, in a tribute, said that Mrs. Shorenstein and her husband had contributed much to the city's cultural, social and civic life and had "consistently helped make this city a better place for all of us."         Art, particularly Asian art, was an enduring interest in Mrs. Shorenstein's life. She joined with other San Franciscans to create the Asian Art Museum, which opened in Golden Gate Park in 1966. She served as a board member for many years and was one of the museum's 27 commissioners at her death. Gallery Named for Family         She last visited the museum in May, when it opened an exhibition and named one of its four galleries of Japanese art in honor of the Shorenstein family. Although she was particularly devoted to Japanese and Chinese art, her tastes also extended to Western works. Her personal collection included both European and American art.         Mrs. Shorenstein made frequent visits abroad in search of additions to the museum's collection, accompanied by Rand Castile, the museum's director. "She began at the Asian Art Museum at its beginning, and she was with us every step of the way," Mr. Castile said yesterday. In the last 20 years, the Shorenstein family has donated works from China, Japan, India, Korea, Indonesia, the Philippines and Turkey.         With her family, Mrs. Shorenstein established the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University. The center was named in honor of her daughter, a journalist and radio news producer who died of cancer in 1986.         Mrs. Shorenstein was born Phyllis Finley in Wellington, Kan., and attended Lone Mountain College in San Francisco.         She was a volunteer ambulance driver at Travis Air Force Base when she met Walter Shorenstein, who was stationed there during World War II.         Mr. Shorenstein became a leading commercial real estate developer and a prominent contributor to Democratic Party causes. She was not active in politics, but the Shorensteins frequently entertained political dignitaries, including Presidents Johnson, Carter and Clinton.         She is survived by her husband of 49 years; two children, Carole Shorenstein-Hays and Douglas Shorenstein, both of San Francisco, and six grandchildren.       
         Eve Gentry, a modern dancer who helped found the Dance Notation Bureau in New York City and later established the Institute for the Pilates Method of Physical Conditioning in Santa Fe, N.M., died on June 17 at her home in Santa Fe. She was 84.         Miss Gentry grew up in San Bernardino, Calif., and was studying in Los Angeles when Martha Graham saw her perform and offered her a scholarship in New York City. Miss Gentry performed with Hanya Holm's New York company from 1936 to 1942, and later founded her own group, the Eve Gentry Dancers. She danced under the name Henrietta Greenhood until 1945, when she professionally adopted Gentry, her husband's surname.         Her concern for preserving choreography led her to establish the Dance Notation Bureau in New York in 1940, with Ann Hutchinson Guest, Janey Price and Helen Priest Rogers. She also taught at New York University and the High School for the Performing Arts.         Persistent back and knee problems led her to investigate, and later teach, a system of physical conditioning devised by Joseph H. Pilates, a physical therapist. In 1968 she moved to New Mexico, where she established a dance school and, in 1991, an institute devoted to the Pilates method.         She is survived by two sisters, Dorothy Newmann and Marion Granish, both of San Bernardino.       
         Dr. Margaret Shaughnessy Gordon, who became a prominent economist in an academic discipline long dominated by men, died on Saturday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 83.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Gordon was a professor of economics at the University of California at Berkeley, where she had served as associate director of the Institute of Industrial Relations from 1954 until 1969. She produced numerous books and studies on health, welfare, employment and, later, higher education.         One of her books, "Employment Expansion and Population Growth: The California Experience, 1900-1950," published in 1954, was among the first analyses to arrive at the conclusion that California, more than any other state, depended on military spending. Another, "Social Security Policies in Industrial Countries: An International Perspective" (Cambridge University Press, 1989) remains in print.         Other books by Dr. Gordon included "Barrier to World Trade" (1941), "The Economics of Welfare Policies" (1963), "Retraining and Labor Market Adjustment in Western Europe" (1965), and "Youth Education and Unemployment Problems: An International Perspective" (1979). Role in War on Poverty         She drafted more than a dozen reports for the Carnegie Commission and Council on Higher Education while serving consecutively as associate director of both from 1969 to 1979. In 1968, President Lyndon B. Johnson named her to the Commission on Income Maintenance Programs to examine all "welfare and related programs" in his War on Poverty.         A native of Wabasha, Minn., she graduated from Bryn Mawr College and received her Ph.D. from Harvard University in 1935. In World War II she worked in the Federal Government's Office of Price Administration.         Dr. Gordon's husband, Robert A. Gordon, who died in 1978 after the couple had been married 42 years, was also a Harvard-educated ecomonics professor, as were her two sons. In Berkeley she was active in civic affairs and was a committeewoman with the Democratic Party of Alameda County. Her husband was also a professor of economics at Berkeley.         She is survived by her sons, Robert J., of Evanston, Ill., an economics professor at Northwestern University, and David M., of Manhattan, a professor of economics at the New School for Social Research. .       
         Dr. Florence Shishko Schwartz, a retired professor of social work at the Hunter College School of Social Work, died on Wednesday at Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut. She was 73 and had homes in Greenport, N.Y., and Greenwich.         The cause was complications from cardiac arrest two weeks after heart surgery, said her daughter, Deborah Schwartz Rapaport.         Dr. Schwartz was on her school's faculty for 33 years, rising from instructor to full professor and retiring in 1991.         She was instrumental in having the subject of voluntarism added to the school's curriculum and was an editor of The Journal of Volunteer Administration. She was also active in student exchanges with Puerto Rico and in other cross-cultural activities. She was a longtime member of the boards of the Jewish Family Services of Greenwich and the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Association.         Dr. Schwartz was born in New York, grew up mainly in the Astoria section of Queens and graduated from Julia Richman High School in Manhattan. She received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College and master's and doctoral degrees from the Columbia School of Social Work.         During World War II, she was a Red Cross social worker at Army hospitals in Virginia and Massachusetts.         In addition to her daughter Deborah of Scarsdale, N.Y., Dr. Schwartz is survived by her husband, Dr. Martin F. Schwartz, a professor at Rockland Community College; another daughter, Nomi Schwartz Freed of Armonk, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Mary Drayton, a playwright whose work appeared on Broadway, died on Friday at Sarasota Memorial Hospital in Sarasota, Fla., where she lived. She was 89.         The cause was a blood clot in her lung, said her daughter, Kristin Helmore.         Ms. Drayton was born in Hope, Ark., on Feb. 27, 1905. She turned to writing after an automobile accident in the 1940's cut short her career as an actress. Her plays included two that were performed on Broadway: "Debut" (1956) and "The Playroom" (1965). She also wrote the plays "Salt of the Earth," "Build Me a Bridge" and "Ducks in a Row," and a novel, "All Our Secrets."         In addition to her daughter, of Clinton, Conn., she is survived by her husband, Tom Helmore.       
         Fredi Washington, one of the first black actresses to gain recognition for her work on stage and in film, died on Tuesday at St. Joseph Medical Center in Stamford, Conn., where she lived. She was 90.         The cause was pneumonia, which developed after a stroke, said her sister, Isabel Powell.         Miss Washington's best-known performance was as the young mulatto who passes for white in the 1934 film "Imitation of Life." Her performance was so convincing that she was accused of denying her heritage in her private life.         "She did pass for white when she was traveling in the South with Duke Ellington and his band," said Jean-Claude Baker, a restaurateur and author and a friend of Ms. Washington's. "They could not go into ice-cream parlors, so she would go in and buy the ice cream, then go outside and give it to Ellington and the band. Whites screamed at her, 'Nigger lover!' " Danced With Josephine Baker         Miss Washington, whose given name was Fredricka, was born in Savannah, Ga., on Dec. 23, 1903. She made her first cabaret appearance in New York at 16 as a member of the Happy Honeysuckles hired by Josephine Baker, Mr. Baker's foster mother, and was a chorus girl in the musical "Shuffle Along" in 1921. While performing at the Club Alabam in Manhattan, she was noticed by the producer Lee Shubert, who recommended her for the co-starring role opposite Paul Robeson in the play "Black Boy" (she played the role under the stage name Edith Warren).         At the end of the run, with no serious productions for black actors in view, she turned to dancing and toured Europe with her dance partner, Al Moiret.         When she returned to the United States, she appeared in such stage productions as "Run, Little Chillun," "Great Day," "Singing the Blues," "Mamba's Daughters," "Lysistrata" and "A Long Way From Home" (an all-black production of Gorky's "Lower Depths"). Her film work included roles in "The Emperor Jones," "Black and Tan Fantasy," "Drums in the Night" and "One Mile From Heaven."         Miss Washington worked for equal rights for blacks in the theater and film industry and was a founder of the Negro Actors Guild. She also was a drama editor and columnist for The People's Voice, a New York weekly newspaper published by Adam Clayton Powell Jr., her sister's husband at the time.         Miss Washington's marriage to Lawrence Brown, a trombonist in the Duke Ellington Orchestra, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Dr. Anthony H. Bell, died in the early 1980's. In addition to Mrs. Powell, of New York City, she is survived by two other sisters, Rosebud Smith of Jamaica, Queens, and Gertrude Penna of Orlando, Fla., and a brother, Floyd Washington of Hempstead, L.I.       
         Barbara Howell, a feminist novelist and short story writer, died on Tuesday in Lenox Hill Hospital. Ms. Howell, who lived in Manhattan, was 57.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Alan Woltz.         Ms. Howell was the author of the novels "Joy Ride" (Viking, 1989) and "A Mere Formality" (M. Evans, 1984) and the nonfiction book "Don't Bother to Come in on Monday" (St. Martin's, 1973). She also wrote extensively for such magazines as Cosmopolitan and Vogue.         She graduated from Barat College in Lake Forest, Ill., and was a Fulbright Scholar at the University of Lille in 1957.         She is survived by her husband and a son, William Leroy, both of Manhattan.         Correction:  June 10, 1994, Friday         An obituary headline on Thursday about Barbara Howell, a novelist and short-story writer, misstated her age. She was 57, not 59.       
         Flora Tobin Bryant, a wedding and party planner who also wrote about both subjects, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Bridgeport. She was 84 and lived in Fairfield, Conn.         The cause was a heart attack, said her lawyer, Richard J. Fricke.         Mrs. Bryant was born in New York, graduated from the Spence School, and in 1941 was a vice chairman of the committee that formed the United Service Organizations, the coalition of groups assisting American military personnel.         Mrs. Bryant began to plan weddings in 1948. In 1956, after her marriage to Lieut. Col. Kendall S. Bryant, the couple founded the Bryant Bureau, a Weston, Conn., business that helped families arrange weddings Colonel Bryant died in 1979 and she sold the business in 1989.         Mrs. Bryant wrote a novel, "No Gloves for the Groom," under the pseudonym Peregrine Pace. With her husband she also wrote, "It's Your Wedding," a guide to planning weddings.       
         The Rev. Beatrice Blair, associate priest at St. George's Episcopal Church on East 16th Street, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 64 and lived in the East Village.         The cause was a heart attack, her husband, John Robbins, said.         Her ordination in 1978 put her among the first female priests in the Episcopal Church. She had served at St. George's for the last four years, after assignments at the Church of the Heavenly Rest and St. Mark's Church-in-the-Bowery. Scion of Blair House Family         A native of Boston, Ms. Blair was raised in Washington, a scion of the family that gave Blair House to the United States Government, which turned it into a residence for dignitaries visiting Washington as guests of the White House. She attended Bryn Mawr College but graduated from the Manhattan branch of Empire State College, and trained for the priesthood at the General Theological Seminary, in Manhattan.         Before moving to New York from Rochester, she was a president of the Monroe County League of Planned Parenthood and the founding president of Eleanor's List, a group formed to raise funds for female candidates who support abortion rights. In the early 1970's, she was also executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League.         More recently, she was a leader in the New York Metropolitan Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights.         Besides her husband, Ms. Blair is survived by a daughter and three sons from a previous marriage: Elizabeth Hillard of Pleasant Hill, Calif., Harper Sibley Jr. of Portland, Me., Blair Sibley of Miami, and Durbin Sibley of Corpus Christi, Tex.; three sisters, Judy Green of Cincinnati, Betsy Douglas of Missoula, Mont., and Edith Blair of Alexandria, Va., and nine grandchildren.       
         Mary Lasswell, an author whose humorous novels about life in Southern California and Texas were popular in the 1940's and 50's, died on Tuesday in the nursing unit of the Solvang Lutheran Home in Solvang, Calif., where she resided. She was 89.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her husband, Dr. Dudley Winn Smith, a surgeon.         Her first book, "Suds in Your Eye," published by Houghton Mifflin in 1942, was described as "a crazy, funny story" about three impecunious elderly women. It was unlike most of the novels coming out of Southern California, wrote Beatrice Sherman in The New York Times Book Review on Dec. 13, 1942. A Broadway play in 1944, based on the book, was dramatized by Jack Kirkland.         Among her other books were "High Time" (1944); "Mrs. Rasmussen's Book of One-Arm Cookery" (1946); "Wait for the Wagon" (1951); "I'll Take Texas" (1958); "Let's Go for Broke" (1962), and "Tio Pepe" (1968).         Miss Lasswell, who was born in Glasgow, Scotland, of American parents, on Feb. 8, 1905, grew up in Brownsville, Tex.         She is survived by her husband, who lives in the Solvang Lutheran Home in Solvang, and a brother, Clyde Lubbock of Pensacola, Fla.       
         Alexandra Troubetzkoy Malcom, a Russian princess and an artist who exhibited in this country and in Europe, died on Friday at Cabrini Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan.         She had been in declining health for some time, said her daughter, Alexandra Rose.         Ms. Troubetzkoy, who used her maiden name professionally, was born in St. Petersburg into the grand nobility of Czarist Russia. A princess herself, she was a grandniece of Prince Paul Troubetzkoy, the sculptor. The family left Russia in 1919, after the October Revolution, and she was educated in France and England.         During the 1930's and 1940's she lived in Italy with her husband, Vittorio Pietrasanta. After his death, she followed her parents to the United States.         She started studying drawing and watercolors at the age of 10. In New York, she trained at the Art Students League and the National Academy of Design. She also attended the Ruskin School of Drawing and studied fine arts at Oxford University.         She had her first exhibition in 1955 in New York. Her watercolor landscapes became part of the collections of museums and private buyers.         Her second husband, Donald C. Malcom, died in 1971.         Besides her daughter, a resident of Manhattan, Ms. Troubetzkoy is survived by two sisters, Mary Shurtleff of Nyack, N.Y., and Countess Brun de St. Hippolyte of Paris, and two granddaughters.       
         Ann McGarry Buchwald, wife of the columnist Art Buchwald and an author and former literary agent, died on Sunday at her home in Washington. She was 74.         She died of lung cancer, her family said.         In the 1970's Mrs. Buchwald was a Washington partner of Irving Lazar, one of Hollywood's top literary and talent agents. But in 1974, after Mr. Lazar agreed to try to sell the memoirs of former President Richard M. Nixon, Mrs. Buchwald ended her partnership, citing a conflict of principle because her husband had written many satirical columns about Watergate and Mr. Nixon.         Besides her autobiography, "Seems Like Yesterday," Mrs. Buchwald was the co-author of "White Gloves and Party Manners" (Robert B. Luce, 1965) and "Stand Up, Shake Hands, Say 'How Do You Do' " (Robert B. Luce, 1969).         Mrs. Buchwald, who was born in Warren, Pa., was also a fashion coordinator for Neiman-Marcus in Dallas, and later was a publicity director for Pierre Balmain in Paris. In 1950, while still in Paris, she opened a public relations firm. She met Mr. Buchwald there the same year, and they married in 1952.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Connie Marks of Culpeper, Va., and Jennifer Buchwald of Boston; a son, Joel, of Denver; three grandchildren, five sisters and two brothers.

         Phoebe Helman, an artist and professor at Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, died on Sunday at Eastern Maine Medical Center in Bangor. She was 65 and had homes in Manhattan and Deer Isle, Me.         The cause was cancer, a statement from the public-affairs department at Pratt said.         Ms. Helman, who was born and reared in New York City, had taught at Pratt's School of Art and Design since 1972. She studied at the Art Students League and earned a bachelor's degree in painting from Washington University in St. Louis in 1951. She worked in painting and collage throughout her life, but in the late 1960's she also began making the large metal sculptures, usually painted black, for which she is best known.         She had her first solo show at the Max Hutchinson Gallery in SoHo in 1974, and over the years received grants from the John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts and the Pollock-Krasner Foundation.         She is survived by her husband, Jack Sonenberg, who is also an artist, and a daughter, Maya Sonenberg of Seattle.

She later served as administrative assistant to the federation's executive secretary-treasurer.         She is survived by her husband, Leonard; two sons, Michael, of Falls Church, and Mark, of Alexandria, Va.; two sisters, Barbara Leonard of McLean, Va., and Mary Schmeich of Gaithersburg, Md., and two grandchildren.

         Alice Childress, an actress and a writer of plays and novels, including "A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich," died on Sunday at Astoria General Hospital in Queens. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Nathan Woodard.         In 1973, in a review of "A Hero Ain't Nothin' but a Sandwich" in The New York Times, the playwright Ed Bullins wrote: "There are too few books that convince us that reading is one of the supreme gifts of being human. Alice Childress, in her short, brilliant study of a 13-year-old black heroin user, achieves this feat in a masterly way."         In the mid-1970's, the book was at the center of a controversy when a Long Island school district banned it and works by Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Langston Hughes and others on the grounds that they contained obscenities and other material considered offensive. Ms. Childress adapted her novel for a 1978 film that starred Cicely Tyson and Paul Winfield.         Among her other books were "Rainbow Jordan," "Those Other People," "When the Rattlesnake Sounds," "Let's Hear It for the Queen," "Like One of the Family" and "A Short Walk." 'Wedding Band'         One of her plays was "Wedding Band," an interracial love story set in Charleston, S.C., at the time of World War I. Ms. Childress wrote the play in 1965 but was unable to find a New York producer until the New York Shakespeare Festival presented it in 1972. In a review of a 1979 production of the play, Richard Eder wrote in The Times that the ideas in "Wedding Band" were "like wildflowers growing in their own ground; not, as in works of less art, like cut flowers sorted and offered by the dozen at a florist shop." ABC later produced the play for television, but eight of the network's affiliates declined to carry the show because of its theme and earthy dialogue.         Her other plays included "Florence," "Gold Through the Trees," "Just a Little Simple," "Trouble in Mind," "String" and "Mojo." With Mr. Woodard, she wrote musicals including "Young Martin Luther King," "Sea Island Song," "Gullah" and "Moms (A Praise Play for a Black Comedienne)," about Jackie (Moms) Mabley.         Ms. Childress was born in Charleston on Oct. 12, 1916. Before she turned to writing, she was an actress with the American Negro Theater, and acted in the original company of "Anna Lucasta." At the time of her death, she was working on a novel for young adults about her African great-grandmother, a slave until the age of 12, and her Scotch-Irish great-grandmother.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a granddaughter, Marilyn Alice Lee of Brooklyn.       
         Anne Freeman Turpin, a retired director of special learning at St. Bernard's School in Manhattan, died yesterday at her home in Richmond. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Douglas Ochs Adler.         Throughout her life, Mrs. Turpin worked with children who had learning problems. She began her teaching career at the Birch Wathen Lenox School in Manhattan in 1971, and moved in 1977 to St. Bernard's School, from which she retired in 1992.         Mrs. Turpin, a native of Richmond, lived in Manhattan for 45 years after her graduation from Vassar College in 1945. In 1970, she received a master's degree from Teachers College at Columbia University.         She was the daughter of Douglas Southall Freeman, the editor of The Richmond News Leader and a biographer of George Washington and Robert E. Lee.         She is survived by her husband, A. Royall Turpin Jr. of Richmond; her son, of Takoma Park, Md.; two daughters, Anne Adler Tarbell and Mary Ballard Malhotra, both of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Katherine Turpin Gnugnoli of Washington and Mary Turpin Barradale of Richmond; a sister, Mary Tyler McClenahan of Richmond; a brother, James Douglas Freeman of Richmond, and three grandchildren.       
         Nancy Lancaster, an American-born socialite who had been an international influence on interior and garden design since the 1920's, died on Friday at her home near Little Haseley, Oxfordshire, England. She was 96.         She died in her sleep after a brief illness, said her daughter-in-law, Lady Anne Tree.         A native of Virginia who moved to England in 1926, Nancy Lancaster was instrumental in creating what is popularly known as the English-country look. This school of interior decoration is characterized by sun-bleached chintz, vibrant wall colors, a casual mix of furniture from various historical periods and an atmosphere of disheveled coziness. John Fowler, Mrs. Lancaster's partner in the London design firm of Colefax & Fowler, called it "pleasing decay."         According to Robert Becker, whose biography of Mrs. Lancaster is to be published by Alfred A. Knopf next year, it was an esthetic fueled by memories of Southern plantation houses that had fallen into romantic disrepair after the Civil War. Among these was her grandfather's estate, Mirador, near Charlottesville. 'An Abstract Nostalgia'         "It was an abstract nostalgia that was particularly appealing to the British upper classes," Mr. Becker said. "Thanks to two world wars, they were losing their way of life, too, just as the Virginians had."         Born in 1897, Nancy Keene Perkins was a daughter of Lizzie Langhorne and T. Moncure Perkins, a meatpacking executive. Orphaned at the age of 15, she was raised by her aunt, Irene Langhorne Gibson, a celebrated beauty who was the original Gibson Girl, a symbol of American womanhood at the turn of the century. Another Langhorne aunt was Nancy, Viscountess Astor, the first woman elected to the House of Commons.         Though Mrs. Lancaster was co-owner of Colefax & Fowler from 1944 to the mid-1980's, she was not a professional decorator. "I'm agin decoratin'," she once said in a Tidewater drawl that remained undimmed after more than 65 years away from home. "I'm a percolator of ideas." The appearance of her own homes -- notably her London apartment's butter-yellow drawing room, completed in 1958 -- inspired generations of designers in Europe and the United States. Her followers include Sister Parish, Mark Hampton and Mario Buatta.         "She brought American vitality to stuffy British houses, which often looked like museums," Mr. Buatta said. "After Nancy blew into town, England loosened up and started looking more personal and lived-in." Cultivator of Roses         Mrs. Lancaster also revived interest in old-fashioned roses, which she cultivated at Ditchley Park, a 3,000-acre estate in Oxfordshire that was her home from 1933 to 1947. One of her last homes, Haseley Court, was the subject of a 1993 BBC television documentary, "An Englishwoman's Garden." She also advised on the restoration of Stratford Hall, a Virginia home of a relative, Robert E. Lee.         Nancy Lancaster's first husband was Henry Field, a grandson of Marshall Field, the department-store magnate. He died in 1918, six months after their wedding. Two years later, she married another Field grandson, Ronald Lambert Tree, who later became a Conservative member of Parliament. They divorced in 1947. She later wed another British politician, Col. Claud G. Lancaster. That marriage also ended in divorce.         Sought after by leading artists and photographers -- John Singer Sargent, Cecil Beaton, Baron De Meyer and Horst P. Horst all paid homage -- Mrs. Lancaster was a popular hostess for guests from American diplomats to the King and Queen of England.         Between 1940 and 1942, Winston Churchill spent many weekends at Ditchley Park, which was considered safer from Axis bombers than the Prime Minister's official country residence, Chequers.         In addition to her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Lancaster is survived by a son, Michael Tree; a sister, Alice Winn; and two granddaughters, all of London.       
         Rose Laub Coser, a sociologist and professor emeritus at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, died on Sunday at her summer home in Wellfleet, Mass. She was 78.         Dr. Coser, who lived in Cambridge, Mass., died of kidney failure, her family said.         She taught at Stony Brook from 1968 until her retirement in 1987, after which she moved to Cambridge. At her death she was an adjunct professor of sociology at Boston College, specializing in the family and medical sociology.         She was born in Berlin and reared in Belgium; she came to the United States in 1939. She started studying philosophy at the New School for Social Research but switched to sociology at Columbia University, where she earned her Ph.D. under the supervision of Robert K. Merton. Taught Sociology at Harvard         Dr. Coser began her teaching career as an instructor at Wellesley College. In 1959 she began teaching at the Harvard University Medical School as an assistant professor of sociology in the department of psychiatry, and later became an associate professor. She also taught at Northeastern University in Boston.         She was the author of "Life in the Ward" (1962) and was involved as a contributor to or editor of "Sociological Studies of Health and Sickness" (1960), "Studies in the Hospital" (1963) and "The Family, Its Structure and Functions" (revised in 1974).         Her recent writing includes "Training in Ambiguity: Learning Through Doing in a Mental Hospital" (1979), "In Defense of Modernity: Role Complexity and Individual Autonomy" (1991) and "Laughter Among Colleagues" (1993). All three books remain in print.         Dr. Coser is survived by her husband of 52 years, Dr. Lewis A. Coser, also a sociologist; a daughter, Dr. Ellen C. Perrin of Brookline, Mass.; a son, Steven M. of Melrose, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Rosa Chacel, a Spanish writer of complex, intellectual novels and poetry, who was in exile during most of the Franco era, died on Wednesday in the Ramon y Cajal Hospital in Madrid. She was 96 and lived in Madrid.         The cause was heart and lung failure, hospital officials said.         An English translation of one of her most widely read novels, "Memoirs of Leticia Valle," won praise when it was published earlier this year by the University of Nebraska Press in a translation by Carol Maier, a professor of Spanish at Kent State University. The work originally appeared in Spanish 49 years ago in Buenos Aires.         Susan Kirkpatrick, a professor of Spanish at the University of California at San Diego, wrote, in the preface to her translation of Miss Chacel's novel "The Maravillas District," which was published in 1992 by the University of Nebraska Press: "Chacel's writing is dense and labyrinthine, but at the same time it is open-ended and dynamic, shaping a narrative design that ends with a query instead of a conclusion."         Miss Chacel (pronounced cha-THELL) was born in Valladolid, in north-central Spain, on June 3, 1898. She studied art in Madrid and spent six years in Rome, where she wrote her first novel, "Season of Departure and Return," which was published in Spain in 1930.         In 1938, as Gen. Francisco Franco drew close to victory in the Spanish Civil War, she fled to South America, where dozens of Spanish intellectuals were in exile. She left Spain largely because her husband, Timoteo Perez Rubio, had been active on the Republican side, and her sympathies were also with the Republic. She spent her 36 years in exile mainly in Buenos Aires and Rio de Janeiro.         From 1959 to 1961, Miss Chacel was in New York City on a Guggenheim Fellowship and wrote a book of literary and philosophical essays, "Saturnalia," which was published in 1972. Over the years, she wrote more than a dozen books, including novels and volumes of poetry and of essays. She returned to Spain in the early 1970's, not long before Franco's death.         In the weeks before her death, while Miss Chacel was in the hospital, she was awarded Spain's Gold Medal for Fine Arts by King Juan Carlos.         Miss Chacel's husband died in 1977. She is survived by a son, Carlos Perez Chacel.         Correction:  August 4, 1994, Thursday         An obituary on Tuesday about Rosa Chacel, a Spanish novelist, misidentified the author of the English translation of her book "The Maravillas District," published in 1992 by the University of Nebraska Press. It was translated by D. A. Demers, not Susan Kirkpatrick.       
         Donna Kay Price, a Westchester County real estate executive and former director of the Lighthouse for the Blind of New York and Westchester, died on Saturday at Westchester County Medical Center in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 59 and lived in Waccabuc, N.Y.         Mrs. Price died of head injuries suffered in a fall at her home, her family said.         Mrs. Price, who was blind, was a longtime fund-raiser for the Seeing Eye Inc. in Morristown, N.J., which trains guide dogs for the blind. She was a past member of the board of the Lighthouse Inc. of New York and its Westchester division.         "She was a devoted supporter of services to people with visual impairments in the Hudson Valley," said Judith Millman, the organization's regional director in White Plains. Started in Advertising         Born in Terre Haute, Ind., Mrs. Price was a Phi Beta Kappa history graduate of the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg, Va. She worked briefly in advertising before making her career in real estate. She was associated for 33 years with Houlihan Lawrence Real Estate of Bronxville, N.Y., most recently as a vice president and manager of the Katonah, N.Y., and Bedford, N.Y., offices.         In an interview three years ago, Mrs. Price said she was a diabetic and lost her sight completely over a period of two years, beginning about 1973.         "In the 1970's, they didn't know what to do with diabetes and eyesight problems," she said. "Now they have a pretty good chance of saving the eyesight with lasers."         She said she turned to the Lighthouse when her sight began to fail and remained associated with them ever since.         Mrs. Price is survived by her husband, Kenneth W., of Waccabuc; a daughter, Darcy Lee Price of Greenwich, Conn.; a son, Timothy of Port Jervis, N.Y.; and a sister, Barbara Lee Crowder of Scarsdale, N.Y.       
         Joan Harrison, a producer and screenwriter who helped write the scripts for "Rebecca," "Foreign Correspondent" and other films directed by Alfred Hitchcock, died on Aug. 14 in London. She was 83.         Miss Harrison was born in Guildford, Surrey, England, where her father published two local newspapers. After attending boarding school in Kent, she received an honor's degree in philosophy, politics and economics at St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where she occasionally reviewed films for the student newspaper. She later studied at the Sorbonne.         In 1933, she was hired as a secretary by Hitchcock, who was at work on "The Man Who Knew Too Much." A poor secretary by her own description, she soon graduated to reading books and scripts, writing synopses and contributing to scripts. She received her first writing credit on Hitchcock's "Jamaica Inn." From Hitchcock to Hollywood         In 1939, Miss Harrison accompanied Hitchcock to Hollywood, working as his assistant and as a writer on "Rebecca," "Suspicion," "Saboteur" and "Shadow of a Doubt."         In 1941, Miss Harrison went out on her own and was hired by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer to write the script for "The Sun Is My Undoing." In 1943, she was hired as a producer at Universal, where her first film was "Phantom Lady," a melodrama starring Franchot Tone. In 1944, she produced and shared the screenwriting credit for "Dark Waters," a thriller starring Merle Oberon.         In the 1940's and 50's, she produced the mystery thrillers "Third Eye," "Uncle Harry," "Nocturne," "Ride the Pink Horse," "Once More, My Darling," "Eye Witness" and "Circle of Danger."         From 1955 to 1962, she produced the television series "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." With Norman Lloyd, she was responsible for selecting stories, hiring writers and directors, casting and supervising the production of each episode. She also produced the television series "Journey Into the Unknown."         She is survived by her husband, the mystery writer Eric Ambler.       
         Nomi Mitty, an actress who appeared on stage and in films and television, died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 54.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Ms. Mitty began her career as a child, appearing on Broadway with Shirley Booth in "A Tree Grows in Brooklyn" in 1951. She played Gertrude Berg's daughter on the popular radio show "The Goldbergs" and toured with Mercedes McCambridge in "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?" and with Edward Everett Horton in "Harvey."         Her television credits included guest appearances on "Hill Street Blues," "Picket Fences," "Knot's Landing" and "L.A. Law." Among her films were "Serpico" and "Melvyn and Howard."         She is survived by her husband, Robert Kaylor; a son, Ross; two stepdaughters, Robin and Sarah, and three brothers and a sister.       
         Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, for nearly two decades the dean of New York University's School of Social Work, died yesterday at her home in South Orange, N.J. She was 73.         The cause was cancer, said a university spokeswoman.         Dr. Ehrenkranz, who was credited with enhancing the school's national reputation, joined its staff in 1966 and became its dean in 1977. In her more than 17 years as dean, the school became one of the largest schools of social work in the nation, enrolling more than 1,000 students in undergraduate and graduate programs.         Under her leadership, the school also pioneered the holistic approach to clinical social work and became the first institution in the New York metropolitan area to offer a doctorate in clinical social work.         In recognition of her contributions, New York University had announced that the school would be renamed the Shirley M. Ehrenkranz School of Social Work. Jay Oliva, president of the university, said yesterday that there would be a renaming ceremony on Sept. 19. Was a Former Caseworker         Dr. Ehrenkranz received a bachelor's degree from Hunter College, master's degrees in English from Temple University, in social economy and social research from Bryn Mawr College and in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, and a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia University.         Before joining New York University, she served as a field instructor at the Rutgers University Graduate School of Social Work and a research assistant at the Columbia University School of Social Work. She was also a caseworker and case supervisor in agencies for families and children. She was president of the New York State Association of Deans in 1980-81 and 1988-89.         She is survived by her husband, Fred Kasoff; two daughters, Pamela Ehrenkranz of New York City and Jean LeGrand of Chicago; a sister, Babette Cohen of Rosyln Heights, L.I., and 16 grandchildren.         Correction:  August 27, 1994, Saturday         An obituary yesterday about Shirley M. Ehrenkranz, dean of New York University's School of Social Work, omitted a survivor. He is her son, Dr. Joel Ehrenkranz of New Vernon, N.J.       
         Valerie Worth Bahlke, a poet and novelist for young readers, died on Sunday at her home in Clinton, N.Y. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Bahlke, who wrote under her maiden name, Valerie Worth, had many interests, from astronomy to gardening to meditation, which became the subject matter she wove into her poetry. She sought to present ordinary things in a fresh way.         She was most widely known for her "small poems" for children, composed in simple free verse. The poet and teacher Myra Cohn Livingston wrote of Ms. Worth's work in The New York Times Book Review in 1988, "The treasures Ms. Worth offers do not lie in some distant, golden land but in the everyday world." For example, of a safety pin, Ms. Worth wrote:         Closed, it sleeps         On its side         Quietly,         The silver         Image         Of some         Small fish;         Opened, it snaps         Its tail out         Like a thin         Shrimp, and looks         At the sharp         Point with a         Surprised eye.         In 1991, the National Council of Teachers of English honored her with its Poetry Award for Excellence in Poetry for Children, given for a body of work.         It was only one of many such citations she garnered over the years. Since the 1950's, her poems have been included in numerous anthologies. She also wrote fiction for adults and young people. 'Small Poems' by the Volume         She was born in Philadelphia and lived in Swarthmore, Pa., Tampa, Fla., and Bangalore, India, when her father, a biologist at Swarthmore College, was asked to go to India to study malaria. She graduated from Swarthmore in 1955.         After settling in Clinton, she joined an informal writing group at Kirkland College and met Natalie Babbitt, an author and illustrator who then furnished the black-and-white drawings for her work, starting with "Small Poems" in 1972. Three more volumes followed, in 1976, 1978 and 1985, and all four appeared in a single paperback in 1987.         Her other books included "The Crone's Book of Words" (1971) and "The Crone's Book of Wisdom" (1988); "Curlicues: The Fortunes of Two Pug Dogs" (1980), and two novels for young adults, "Gypsy Gold" (1983) and "Fox Hill" (1986).         Another book of her verses for children, "At Christmastime," was published two years ago. Much of her work remains in print, and at her death she had completed two more such collections of all-new poems. They are scheduled for publication by HarperCollins in 1995 and 1996.         She is survived by her husband, George W. Bahlke; a son, Conrad D., of Hoboken, N.J.; two daughters, Catherine B. Hornstein of Brooklyn and Margaret B. Diskin of West Chester, Pa.; two brothers, Michael Worth of Swarthmore and Douglas Worth of Newton, Mass., and a granddaughter.       
         Rildia Bee O'Bryan Cliburn, the mother of Van Cliburn and his only piano teacher until he was 17, died yesterday at All Saints Episcopal Hospital in Fort Worth. She was 97 and lived in Fort Worth.         The cause was a stroke that occurred last Thursday, said Mary Lou Falcone, Mr. Cliburn's spokeswoman.         Mrs. Cliburn's mother was an actress and her father was a judge and adviser to state officials. She studied music from an early age in Texas, then at the Cincinnati Conservatory and at the New York School of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.         She returned to Texas in the 1920's to marry Harvey Levan Cliburn, an oil-company executive. She gave piano lessons, and discovered her son's ability when at the age of 3 he went to the piano after one of her students left and played by ear the piece that had just been taught.         Mrs. Cliburn served as her son's adviser, manager and inspiration throughout his career. She was also active in the arts, and established a foundation to help young performers.         Her husband died in 1974. She is survived by her son, of Fort Worth.       
         Camille Helene Block Lehman, a respected and innovative interior designer, died on Tuesday at her home in Atlanta. She was 84.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Lehman began her career at 16, designing for a bathing-suit manufacturer. After graduating from the Parsons School of Design at 19, she was hired by the dress and jewelry designer Hattie Carnegie.         Later, Mrs. Lehman thought of several applications in the home for Lucite, then a new product, and traveled the country marketing her ideas.         Mrs. Lehman and her husband, Charles, founded Lehmans & Associates, which became a successful interior design firm. In 1966, she received a Burlington House award for outstanding interior design and space planning.         She was a member of the Board of Governors of the American Institute of Interior Designers and a Fellow of the American Society of Interior designers.         "No matter how ingenious her design solutions, she never forgot that real people were going to eat, sleep and live in the rooms she created," said Dorothy Kalins, editor of Garden Design magazine.         The Lehmans continued to work in interior design until Mr. Lehman's death in 1990.         She is survived by her sons, John and Jeffrey, and two granddaughters, Kristin and Heather.       
         Miriam K. Carliner, a Federal specialist on poverty and sexual bias in education, died on Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 73.         The cause was stomach cancer, her family said.         A native of Bad Kreuznach, Germany, Mrs. Carliner migrated to the United States as a teen-ager and graduated with a bachelor's degree in economics in 1942 from George Washington University.         She dealt with problems of disadvantaged students in the District of Columbia school system and directed a study by the League of Women Voters that examined the allocation of resources among the schools of neighborhoods in the District in 1965.         In 1964 and 1965, she coordinated a conference for 27,000 people involved in Head Start, the early-education program for disadvantaged children.         As a senior program officer in the United States Office of Education, she oversaw demonstration projects aimed at the disadvantaged.         In 1980, Mrs. Carliner was appointed to direct the Woman's Action Program of the Department of Health and Human Services. She reported on sex discrimination in the department and assessed programs affecting women.         After she left the Government in 1985, she became a mediator for the District of Columbia's Superior Court and sat on the District's Civilian Complaint Review Board.         Mrs. Carliner is survived by her husband of 50 years, David; a son, Geoffrey, of West Newton, Mass.; a daughter, Deborah Carliner of Washington; a brother, Karl Kalter of Munich, and four grandchildren.       
         Sheila Campbell Williamson, the founding director of the Community Foundation of New Jersey in Morristown, died on Sunday at her home in Short Hills, N.J. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Williamson, who continued to work until earlier this month, helped set up the foundation in 1980 and became a leader of the community-foundation movement in the United States. Such organizations collect endowed funds from individuals, businesses or private foundations to benefit innovative projects in a specific area.         Mrs. Williamson became the executive director of what began as the Essex County Community Foundation in 1980. Starting with little more than a borrowed desk and a phone, she nurtured the foundation into an organization with assets of about $11.5 million and distributions of more than $6 million.         Its donors include such corporate giants as Johnson & Johnson and the AT&T Corporation, and the Newark Boys Chorus, the New Jersey Symphony, AIDS education, neighborhood initiatives, civic improvements and various social services have been among the beneficiaries. Gov. Christine Todd Whitman is a trustee and former president but the foundation operates with little fanfare,         Mrs. Williamson was active in many local organizations, including the United Way of Essex and West Hudson, the Association for Children in New Jersey and the Orange Orphan Society. She was a member of the Planning Board of Millburn and Short Hills.         Mrs. Williamson was a native of Glasgow. She graduated from Wells College in Aurora, N.Y., and received a master's degree in city and regional planning from Rutgers University. In the 1950's, she was a securities analyst for Bear, Stearns, one of the first women to be employed in that capacity on Wall Street.         Mrs. Williamson is survived by her husband, James G., and two daughters, Anne W. Holman of Short Hills and Christina Williamson of Manhattan.       
         Dr. Margaret Olds Strahl, a retired New York psychiatrist and analyst known for her research on the clinical treatment of schizophrenia, died on Monday at the William Hill Health Care Center in Easton, Md. She was 77.         The cause was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         Dr. Strahl was born in New York City, received her medical degree from Long Island College of Medicine in 1943 and completed her training in psychoanalysis at Columbia University in 1948. She was an associate in psychiatry at Columbia until 1966.         From 1968 to 1991, she worked at the New York Medical College and Metropolitan Hospital Center, while also keeping a private practice as a psychoanalyst, preparative psychotherapist and diagnostic consultant.         In the 1980's, she also worked for the Veterans Administration, specializing in the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorders among Vietnam veterans.         She was the author, co-author or editor of several volumes, including "Masked Schizophrenia: Diagnosis and a Unified Method of Treatment" (1980), "Differential Diagnosis in Clinical Psychiatry" (1972) and "The Complete Psychiatrist: The Achievements of Paul H. Hoch, M.D." (1968). An environmentalist, she donated a 400-acre family farm to the Chesapeake Audubon Society for an educational center in Easton.         Her husband, William E., died in 1974.         She is survived by two sons, Eric R., of Prescott, Ariz., and Dr. Stuart D., of Easton, and two granddaughters.       
         Dolly Haas, a petite and vivacious actress on stage and screen, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital. She was 84.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the Broadway artist Al Hirschfeld. For many decades the two were an elegant couple on the aisle at all Broadway opening nights, watching the actors and actresses whom Mr. Hirschfeld would sketch for The New York Times.         Before their marriage in 1943, Miss Haas was a celebrated movie star in Germany and had a brief Hollywood career. She also played leading roles in plays on and Off Broadway. When Miss Haas made her New York stage debut in 1941 in Erwin Piscator's production of the Chinese fantasy "The Circle of Chalk," Brooks Atkinson, the drama critic of The Times, wrote that she was "an exquisitely beautiful actress, with the limpid grace of a Chinese poem or print."         She was born in Hamburg, Germany, the daughter of a German mother and an English father. As a child, she studied ballet and, before she was 20, was acting in cabaret and musical comedy. She easily made the transition to films, in 1929 in "One Summer of Happiness," playing a department store doll that came to life. In this and other romantic movies, written or directed by Billy Wilder, Anatol Litvak and Fritz Kortner, among others, she often portrayed figures of innocence.         With the rise of Hitler, she left her native country and her growing career and went to London, playing the Lillian Gish role in the sound movie version of D. W. Griffith's "Broken Blossoms." The film was directed by Hans Brahm, who became Miss Haas's first husband. Whisked off to Hollywood, she languished for a time as producers looked for suitable roles and tried to persuade her to change her name to Lilli Marlowe. Soon she left for New York and a life on the stage.         After "The Circle of Chalk," she was in Piscator's version of "War and Peace" and in 1946 replaced Mary Martin opposite Yul Brynner in the musical "Lute Song," which she and Mr. Brynner later took on tour to London. In 1947 she acted with John Gielgud and Miss Gish in "Crime and Punishment" on Broadway. She was also in the Off Broadway productions of "The Threepenny Opera" and "Brecht on Brecht." In 1953 she returned to the movies, appearing notably in Alfred Hitchcock's "I Confess."         Miss Haas and Mr. Hirschfeld met when the artist was on assignment to draw a sketch of a summer theater company for The Times. On occasion, Miss Haas's portrait appeared in the background in her husband's drawings. In 1975, she returned to Germany, where she was honored with a retrospective of her films at the 25th annual Berlin International Film Festival.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Nina, and two grandchildren.         Services will be at the Frank E. Campbell Funeral Home, 1076 Maddison Avenue, at 81st Street, Manhattan, at 4 P.M. on Sunday.       
         Ann Schreiber, a regional administrator in the Northeast United States and the Caribbean for the Department of Health and Human Services, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 58 and lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Sol Schreiber, a former Federal magistrate in Manhattan.         As administrator for Region 2, consisting of New York, New Jersey, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, Mrs. Schreiber headed a staff of 100 and was responsible for distributing $4 billion a year.         An alumna of Brooklyn College, Mrs. Schreiber attended graduate school at Columbia University and was a midcareer fellow at the Woodrow Wilson School of Princeton University.         Also surviving are her mother, Helen, and a sister, Carol Martini of Philadelphia.       
         Barbara Fassbinder, one of the first health care professionals to be infected with the AIDS virus while on the job, died on Tuesday at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. She was 40 and lived in Monona, Iowa.         The cause was complications from AIDS, the hospital said.         Mrs. Fassbinder was infected with H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, in 1986 while helping treat a patient in the emergency room of Memorial Hospital in Prairie du Chien, Wis.         While she was pressing gauze on a needle puncture, the patient's blood apparently mingled with her blood through small cuts on her hand from gardening, she said in 1990. The young man died, and an autopsy showed he had AIDS. But it was not until January 1987, when she tried to make a blood donation, that she discovered she had been infected.         She and her family kept the infection a secret until she decided to speak out in 1990. "My biggest fear was how the community would react to me and my kids and my husband," she said at a news conference in Iowa City in which she told her story in the hope that it would warn other health-care workers. The 1,500 people of Monona, a farming community in northeastern Iowa, gave her family "nothing but support," she said at the time.         Dr. Michael Osterholm, an AIDS expert and epidemiologist with the Minnesota Department of Health who became a friend of her family, said she "helped bridge the gap between the worlds of the health care provider and the AIDS patient in need of competent and compassionate care like no one else could."         Mrs. Fassbinder traveled extensively, talking to people about AIDS and how to prevent infection by H.I.V., Dr. Osterholm said. She testified about AIDS before Congress, and in 1992 she was recognized by the Surgeon General and the Department of Health and Human Services for her work.         A native of Marion, Ohio, she also served on the National Health Care Reform Committee set up by Hillary Rodham Clinton and was a member of the Iowa State Commission on AIDS, Dr. Osterholm said.         She is survived by her husband, David; two daughters, Eva and Emily, and a son, Joel, all of Monona; her parents, James and Ethel Herring, of Marion, Iowa; three sisters, Kathryn Fassbinder, of Elgin, Iowa, Mary Walston of Kewaunee, Wis., and Susan Valleire of Rock Island, Ill.; four brothers, J. Stephen Herring of Idaho Falls, Idaho, Edward Herring, of Rockford, Ill., Mark Herring, of Manitowoc, Wis., and John Herring of Cedar Rapids, Iowa, and a grandmother, Martha McElroy of Creston, Iowa.       
         Dorothy Dehner, a gifted sculptor of Surrealist and geometric abstractions in bronze and wood, whose professional career began in the 1950's after a stormy marriage to David Smith, the New York School artist, was found dead yesterday in a stairwell outside her apartment in Manhattan. She was 92.         Her dealer, Susan Teller, said yesterday that the cause of death had not yet been determined.         Last year, on the occasion of a retrospective of Ms. Dehner's work that toured the United States, Holland Cotter wrote in The New York Times that her "initial pieces owe something to Smith's rangy, attenuated style, but have a Surrealist lyricism very much their own." He added, "It was a style Ms. Dehner would continue to refine and simplify as she began working in wood."         Ms. Dehner was born in Cleveland in 1901. She studied painting with three of her aunts, amateur artists, and dance with a former member of the experimental Denishawn company. Her parents and only sister died by the time she was 18, losses that depressed her for years, and she then decided on a career in the theater in New York City.         There, working Off Broadway and taking classes at the Art Students League, she met painters like John Graham, Stuart Davis and Arshile Gorky, who were pioneering abstraction in America when it was still disparaged here for being too European. She also met a young, prickly and ambitious sculptor, David Smith. They married in 1927.         At first they lived in Brooklyn, but in 1940 they moved to an 18th-century farmhouse in the small town of Bolton Landing in upstate New York. Ms. Dehner painted a series of idyllic scenes of their life together that she collectively titled "Life on the Farm." She also did a remarkable series of ink drawings of demonic figures surrounded by vultures and bats, which she called "Damnation Series." Only years later did she realize how much these drawings expressed the increasing psychological discomfort she felt in the waning years of her marriage.         Her career as an artist had to play second fiddle to Smith's. Even though her 1948 drawing "Star Cage" was translated into a sculpture by him a short while later, he was never encouraging about her work. They divorced in 1951.         Four years later, she made her first sculpture. By 1957 she was represented by the prestigious Willard Gallery in New York City, with which she remained until 1976. She had solo exhibitions at the Jewish Museum in New York in 1965 and the Phillips Collection in Washington in 1990, among other shows.         Ms. Dehner's second husband, Ferdinand Mann, whom she married in 1957, died in 1974.         She is survived by a stepson, Irwin Mann of New York City, and a stepdaughter, Abigail Mann Thurstrom of Lexington, Mass.       
         Sandra Fisher, a figurative painter and printmaker who was also the wife of the painter R. B. Kitaj, died on Monday at the National Hospital for Nervous Disorders in London. She was 47 and lived in London.         The cause has not been determined, Marilyn McCully, a family friend, said yesterday.         Ms. Fisher, who was born in New York City and brought up in Florida and California, studied art at the Chouinard Institute in Los Angeles. She met Mr. Kitaj in 1970 while working for the Los Angeles art-print publisher Gemini G.E.L. She and Mr. Kitaj were married in 1983.         Although Ms. Fisher's work tended to be small, she was beginning to enjoy success for her public commissions. At the time of her death, two posters she designed for the London Transport's Art on the Underground series had brought her wide attention in London and she was at work on a series of paintings for the reconstruction of the Globe Theater.         Ms. Fisher's most recent show was at the Lefevre Gallery in London in 1993.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by their son, Max; a stepson, Lem Dobbs of Los Angeles; a stepdaughter, Dominie Kitaj of London; her father, Gene, of Tucson, Ariz.; her mother, Ethel, of Santa Monica, Calif.; a sister, Margaret, of Emeryville, Calif., and a stepgrandson, Joe Kitaj of Los Angeles.       
         Joan Wolff, the director of the Allan Stone Gallery in Manhattan for 25 years, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said Claudia Stone, a daughter of the owner of the art gallery.         Mrs. Wolff went to work at the gallery, which is now on East 90th Street, east of Park Avenue, in 1968. She helped organize exhibitions of works by the gallery's artists Richard Estes and Wayne Thibaud, as well as shows of paintings by Arshile Gorki, Franz Kline, Willem de Kooning and John Graham.         Mrs. Wolff, whose name was originally Margaret Joan Trott, was born in Akron, Ohio, and graduated from Oberlin College. She is survived by her husband, Raymond A. Wolff Jr., the leader of the Dutch Wolff Orchestra, a society band; two daughters, Margaret, of Seattle, and Melora, of Oneonta, N.Y., and a sister, Beverly Earle Knapp of New York City.       
         Barbara Drew Hoffstot, an architectural and community preservationist, died on Sept. 18 at her Pittsburgh home. She was 75 and also had homes in Palm Beach, Fla.; New Waterford, Ohio, and County Galway, Ireland.         She died after a long illness, The Palm Beach, Fla., Post reported.         At her death, Mrs. Hoffstot was a vice president of the Preservation Foundation of Palm Beach and vice chairwoman of the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation, two groups that she helped found. She had served as co-chairwoman of Palm Beach's first Landmarks Preservation Commission and had drafted landmarks preservation legislation for that city. She was a former trustee of the National Trust for Historic Preservation.         Her writings included the book "Landmark Architecture of Palm Beach," which was published in 1974 and has been twice revised.         Mrs. Hoffstot, whose family has spent winters in Palm Beach for three generations, was born Barbara S. Drew in Pittsburgh, graduated from the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Conn., and attended Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla.         She is survived by her husband of 46 years, Henry Phipps Hoffstot Jr.; a daughter, Thayer of Westlake Village, Calif.; a son, Henry Phipps 3d of Ligonier, Pa., and New York, and four grandchildren.       
         Margaret Brown Klapthor, an expert on White House history and a former department chairman at the Smithsonian Institution, died on Monday at her home in Washington. She was 72.         The cause was stomach cancer, said a son, Paul Edward Klapthor of Sumter, S.C.         Mrs. Klapthor retired from the Smithsonian in 1983. She first went to work there as a scientific aide in 1943, and rose through the curatorial ranks in its divisions of civil and political history, becoming curator of the Smithsonian's First Ladies collection and chairman of the institution's department of national and military history.         Among her writings is the historical text in "The First Ladies Cook Book: Favorite Recipes of All the Presidents of the United States," an illustrated volume of historical lore and recipes. It was published for Parents' Magazine Press in 1965, and went through several editions.         The book was praised by Craig Claiborne, then the food critic for The New York Times, who called it "perhaps the most comprehensive and detailed volume ever written" about "what American Presidents and their wives have dined on."         It reported, for example, that Ulysses S. Grant personally selected the wines to be served at formal dinners, "though his own glass was usually turned down"; that Chester A. Arthur was an epicure who savored fine wines, and that William McKinley's taste ran to fried potatoes, bacon and eggs, johnnycakes and cherry pie.         Mrs. Klapthor also wrote "First Ladies" (sixth edition 1990, White House Historical Society) and was a co-author, with her father, Paul D. Brown, of "The History of Charles County, Maryland," in 1958.         She gave lectures on White House history that detailed the occupants' idiosyncrasies, like Dolley Madison's conversational icebreaker of reading a passage from whatever book she was carrying at the time.         In the 1950's, when Mrs. Klapthor was in charge of the gowns of White House hostesses, she discovered Dolley Madison's inauguration gown, which had been kept by heirs. She traced it to the William Rockwell Nelson Gallery of Art in Kansas City, Mo., and the gallery then sent it to the Smithsonian on indefinite loan.         As associate curator in the division of political history, Mrs. Klapthor assembled a Smithsonian collection of White House china in connection with her creation of First Ladies Hall, a modernized setting for the Smithsonian's First Ladies costume collection.         Sometimes she talked about more recent First Ladies. In 1988, commenting on reports of summit talk tiffs between Nancy Reagan and Raisa M. Gorbachev, the wife of the Soviet leader, Mrs. Klapthor said in an interview in The Times, "It struck me as something that had been manufactured by the press."         Mrs. Klapthor was born in Henderson, Ky., reared in Charles County and graduated from the University of Maryland.         In the last 21 years she suffered from rheumatoid arthritis, and was confined to a wheelchair for the last two years. Her husband, Frank Edward Klapthor, died earlier this year.         Besides her son Paul, she is survived by another son, Carlson Brown Klapthor of Washington; a daughter, Frances Andrews of Baltimore; a sister, Mary Berry Moore of Port Tobacco, Md., and four grandchildren.       
         Sister Parish, the acclaimed and enduring American interior decorator who began her career when she was a young Depression-era mother and later came to redesign rooms of the White House during the Kennedy Administration, died on Thursday at her home in Dark Harbor, Maine. She was 84 and also had a home in New York City.         She had suffered a lengthy illness, said Dorothy B. Gilbert, one of her daughters.         Mrs. Parish's six decades of decorating epitomized the rise of women in her own and other professions in 20th-century America. The one-room business she founded in 1933 in Far Hills, N.J., evolved into the noted decorating firm of Parish-Hadley Associates, based in Manhattan, whose designs consistently exuded quality.         The anxious 23-year-old of 1933 -- whose nursery nickname had replaced her seldom-used given name, Dorothy -- went on to become a force in forming and articulating tastes in interior design. Vogue magazine once said she was "the most famous of all living women interior designers, whose ideas have influenced life styles all over America." 'Patrician Aplomb'         John Richardson, an art historian, wrote in 1989, "No one else in America does a room with such patrician aplomb, such life-enhancing charm, such a lack of gimmickry or trendiness."         With a profile that seemed carved from the Maine coastline, her longtime home and design influence, Mrs. Parish was a strong traditionalist. "What seems important to me is permanence, comfort and a look of continuity in the design and decoration of a house," she once observed. "The happiest times of my life are associated with beautiful, familiar things and family."         She and her firm became known for the low-keyed handsomeness of their work and for their well-heeled and relatively conservative clientele. It included President and Mrs. John F. Kennedy; the philanthropists Brooke Astor and Enid Annenberg Haupt; William S. Paley, the chairman of CBS, and members of the Bronfman, Getty, Mellon, Rockefeller, Vanderbilt and Whitney clans.         In 1988, one of Queen Elizabeth II's daughters-in-law, the Duchess of York, asked the firm to design the interior of the ducal couple's new house near Windsor Castle. But the assignment was eventually switched to a British designer, and the British press reported that the Queen thought the Americans' plans were too expensive. Still Working in Her 80's         Mrs. Parish stayed on as a partner in the firm into her 80's, proving to be a notably durable member of a pioneer cohort of American women who came to prominence as interior decorators between the two world wars.         Mrs. Parish is widely considered to have originated, in the 1960's, the decorating idiom that became known as American country style: she was an early and influential champion of the humble striped cloth called mattress ticking, which had traditionally covered mattresses, using it for slipcovers and on throw pillows.         She saw no conflict between innovation and traditionalism. As she wrote in HG magazine in 1990, "Years ago, my partner, Albert Hadley, and I were delighted when patchwork quilts, four-poster beds, painted floors, knitted throws, rag rugs and hand-woven bedsteads were first listed among the 'innovations' of our firm."         "The list sounds old-fashioned, and no decorator wants to be that," she continued, "but Albert and I understood that innovation is often the ability to reach into the past and bring back what is good, what is beautiful, what is lasting." Father Collected Antiques         Mrs. Parish's own girlhood was, if not regal, at least baronial. She was born Dorothy May Kinnicutt in July 15, 1910, in Morristown, N.J., the daughter of G. Hermann Kinnicutt and the former May Appleton Tuckerman, who had homes in Manhattan, Maine and Paris, as well as New Jersey.         Mrs. Parish's father was a collector of antiques (as was a cousin, Dorothy Draper, who also became a renowned decorator). Much later she would recall the distaste she felt as a child for the furniture her father collected, "that awful English brown," as she put it.         As a teen-ager, she saw painted French furniture in Paris -- and experienced a revelation.         She went to the Chapin School in Manhattan and to the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va., made her debut and was married to Mr. Parish in 1930 in Manhattan with, as The New York Times reported at the time, "a representative gathering of old New York families on hand." Decorating a Farmhouse         After her marriage, she and her husband had a home on East End Avenue in Manhattan -- which had been done by a decorator -- and a farmhouse in Far Hills, N.J., which Mrs. Parish herself decorated, with gusto.         Her handiwork was admired, friends began coming to her for help with decorating, and she later confidently recalled that "it never occurred to me that I wasn't qualified to give it."         It was four years after the Wall Street crash of 1929 that Mrs. Parish, who had never received a high school diploma, opened her first office. Hard times were coming upon her husband and her father, both blue-blooded stockbrokers. She called her business "Mrs. Henry Parish 2d Interiors" and placed it in Far Hills.         The success that followed was fueled by her taste, talent and strength of will. Mr. Hadley, who joined forces with her in 1962, said in 1991 that "Sis always knows when a room is right and a room is not." She was famed for creating a homey "undecorated look."  'Money, Big Money'         In some ways, Mrs. Parish's rise was made easier by her upper-crust roots, and her earliest work was decorating the houses of friends.         Decorating by Mrs. Parish and her firm also acquired a reputation for being expensive. The New York Times columnist Charlotte Curtis wrote in 1985 that Parish-Hadley work "costs money, big money."         But Mrs. Parish also had an economical streak. In the mid-1960's, she acquired a batch of turn-of-the-century golden oak furniture at a bargain basement price, the story goes, then painted it white and used it in decorating a house that she and her husband had bought in Maine.         As the design editor Elaine Greene wrote later in The New York Times, "when shown in the January 1967 issue of House & Garden, the house dazzled decorators the way Christian Dior's 1947 New Look did the fashion world."         The white furniture and other furnishings in the house -- including soft-hued chintz, needlework, hand-crafted cotton rugs and paintings of dogs -- became staples of the style. Decorating for the Kennedys         Mrs. Parish met Jacqueline Kennedy socially in the late 1950's and helped her decorate the house in the Georgetown section of Washington where she and her husband, John F. Kennedy, lived while he was a Senator. After Mr. Kennedy was elected President, his wife made Mrs. Parish a consultant in her redecorating of the White House.         Mrs. Kennedy also named her to a committee that was formed to help furnish the White House with authentic pieces from a century and a half earlier.         Speaking of Mrs. Kennedy's plans for redoing the family quarters in the building, Mrs. Parish said early in 1961 that the nation's new First Lady was a person of "simple tastes who wants to create a home."         The walls of the family quarters were done in pastel tones -- the private drawing room was eventually done in yellow and white.         In the years since, there have been persistent reports that Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Parish -- who could be blunt and acerbic -- had a falling-out over the White House. As Town & Country magazine recounted it in 1988, the First Lady "fired Sister for telling little Caroline to keep her feet off the upholstery. Sister would later describe the experience in explicit, harsh terms."         But Mrs. Parish could go to enormous lengths to please a client. Sally Bedell Smith wrote in her 1990 book "In All His Glory: The Life of William S. Paley" that in a single bedroom Mrs. Parish and Mr. Hadley did in the 1960's in Mr. Paley's Fifth Avenue duplex, "a painter worked for five months applying 18 coats of paint -- six different shadings just for the base, plus glazing."         Mr. Parish died in 1977, having spent 34 years with the Wall Street securities firm of Loeb Rhoades & Company.         Mrs. Parish is survived by her daughters, Mrs. Gilbert of Hot Springs, Ark., and May Appleton Bartlett of Boston; eight grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Deborah Norden, an administrator for the New York State Council on the Arts, died on Thursday in the USAir plane crash. She was 40 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Norden was also an architect and worked for the firms of Paul Segal, Richard Dattner and Charles Boxenbaum in New York City before joining the arts council in 1985.         She wrote about architecture for magazines and edited a book, "Reweaving the Urban Fabric" (Princeton Architectural Press, 1988). Most recently she had been working on a book about the architect Fay Jones.         She was born in Manhattan and grew up in Hartsdale, N.Y. She graduated from Brown University in 1976 and earned a master's degree in architecture from Princeton University. During the 1991-92 school year, she was a Loeb Fellow at Harvard University.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Barry Magid; her parents, Peter and Ruth Norden, of Hartsdale; a sister, Linda Norden, of Manhattan, and a grandmother, Margaret Norden, of Forest Hills, Queens.       
         Amy Clampitt, known for her dense, ornate and allusive poetry, died on Saturday at her home in Lenox, Mass. She was 74 and also had a home in Manhattan.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said Anne Close, her editor at Alfred A. Knopf.         Ms. Clampitt published her first full-length book of poetry, "The Kingfisher," when she was 63. It was a delayed but auspicious beginning. Richard Tillinghast, in The New York Times Book Review, wrote that the author "immediately merits consideration as one of our most distinguished contemporary poets." The work, which challenged readers with long strings of dependent clauses, an often obscure vocabulary and arcane literary allusions, ran counter to the prevailing taste for pared-down, plain speech. Instead, she offered "baroque profusion, the romance of the adjective, labyrinthine syntax, a festival lexicon," the poet Alfred Corn wrote in a review.         Ms. Clampitt was born in New Providence, Iowa, and grew up on a 125-acre farm. After earning a bachelor's degree with honors in English at Grinnell College in Grinnell, Iowa, in 1941 she studied at Columbia University and the New School for Social Research.         She worked as a secretary and a writer at Oxford University Press from 1943 to 1951 and as reference librarian at the National Audubon Society from 1952 to 1959. Through the 1960's and most of the 70's, she was a freelance writer, editor and researcher. From 1977 to 1982 she was an editor at E. P. Dutton. Initially Self-Published         In college, Ms. Clampitt succumbed to the spell of Gerard Manley Hopkins, but she wrote little poetry at the time. In the 1950's, she made unsuccessful stabs at novel writing. It was not until the 60's that she began writing poetry in earnest, initially without success. In 1974, at her own expense, she published a poetry chapbook, "Multitudes, Multitudes." The work caught the eye of Howard Moss, the poetry editor of The New Yorker, who began publishing Ms. Clampitt regularly. In 1981, a second small collection, "The Isthmus," was published.         "The Kingfisher," published in 1983 by Alfred A. Knopf, immediately pushed its author to the front ranks of American poets. Organized around the elements earth, air, fire and water, it treated subjects as various as the plants and marine life of New England, John Lennon's murder, the Holocaust and the Vietnam War.         Comparing Ms. Clampitt to Hopkins, Marianne Moore and Elizabeth Bishop, critics noted her pinpoint descriptions of the natural world that led to unexpected metaphysical insights and conclusions. She once referred to herself as "a poet of place," a characterization that she later revised to "a poet of displacement." From Life and Myth         "What the Light Was Like" (1985, Knopf) solidified its author's reputation. Like "The Kingfisher," it began with several poems about the New England coast, notably the book's title poem, an elegy for a drowned lobsterman.         In "Archaic Figure" (1987, Knopf), inspired in part by the author's travels in Greece, Ms. Clampitt used Greek myth to explore what Virginia Woolf called "the ancient consciousness of women." Her other major collections were "Westward" (1990, Knopf) and "A Silence Opens" (1994, Knopf).         She also published an essay collection, "Predecessors, et Cetera" (1991, University of Michigan Press) and edited "The Essential Donne" (1988, Ecco Press).         Ms. Clampitt received a fellowship award for distinguished poetic achievement from the Academy of American Poets in 1982 and a MacArthur Fellowship in 1992. She was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.         She is survived by her husband, Harold L. Korn; two brothers, Lawrence, of Brunswick, Me., and Philip, of Auburn Hills, Mich., and a sister, Beth, of Carlisle, Iowa.       
         Jessica Tandy, who enhanced the American theater and enriched the American screen as few actresses have, died yesterday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 85.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, the actor Hume Cronyn.         Miss Tandy triumphed on Broadway in 1947 as Blanche Dubois in Tennessee Williams's "Streetcar Named Desire," and was still a great star more than 40 years later when she played the title character in the 1989 film "Driving Miss Daisy." In the years between, she and Mr. Cronyn, played opposite each other in success after success to become the most illustrious theater couple of their day.         With the role of Blanche Dubois, Miss Tandy emerged from a series of minor film roles as a maid for some of Hollywood's leading ladies, to establish herself as one of the leading ladies of the stage. The memory can still bring chills to those who saw her performance, which the New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson called "incredibly true." Almost four decades later, another New York Times drama critic, Frank Rich, wrote of her, "Everything this actress does is so pure and right that only poets, not theater critics, should be allowed to write about her."         When she was 80 years old, she brought that purity and rightness to her portrayal of an aging and fiercely independent Southern lady in "Driving Miss Daisy." It was a performance that won her critical acclaim from Los Angeles to Berlin and, at last, an Academy Award. When she received the Oscar in March 1990 she was the oldest person ever to win one. She vowed to go on working, although she said she hoped she would know when to stop, "before they have to get the hook." The Academy Award came one year after she won an Emmy for her performance in the television adaptation of "Foxfire," of which her husband was was a co-writer. Even after she became seriously ill she continued to work, completing three films and two television dramas. A Phenomenal Record Of Joint Triumphs         When Miss Tandy and Mr. Cronyn first appeared together, in "The Fourposter" in 1951, audiences found a husband-and-wife team that would come to succeed Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne as the foremost couple of the American theater. One triumph followed another, culminating in "The Gin Game" in 1977 and "Foxfire" in 1982.         By 1986, when they appeared in "The Petition," Mr. Rich was writing of "their legendary theatrical relationship" and of a Cronyn-Tandy moment as "an acting phenomenon now unique in the Broadway theater and possibly never to come its way again." Mel Gussow, another drama critic for The Times, called them "two actors at their summit." He wrote that when the Cronyns acted together, it was "a matter of hearts, minds and bodies in creative harmony."         One of their last projects together was "To Dance With the White Dog," a television movie that had its premiere last year. At last night'a Emmy Awards in Pasadena, Calif., Mr. Cronyn was named best actor in a mini-series or special for his performance as a recently widowed man mourning his wife. Miss Tandy was nominated for best actress but did not win. A clip from the movie was shown during the awards ceremony in a brief tribute to her.         When they took "The Gin Game" to Moscow in 1979, they won the accolade that Mr. Cronyn treasures above all others. Oleg N. Yefremov, the director of the renowned Moscow Art Theater, wrote in his review, "It takes a couple of actors from America to remind us what Stanislavsky was talking about."         Miss Tandy was nominated five times for a Tony and won three: in 1948 for her role as Blanche Dubois, for "The Gin Game" in 1978, and for "Foxfire" in 1983. Mr. Cronyn was also nominated for "The Gin Game" but did not win. "I was bitterly disappointed," Miss Tandy said. "His performance is part of mine. I think he's very proud when I win, and vice versa."         In July 1994 they were honored with a special Tony for their life's work in the theater. They had already received the Kennedy Center Lifetime Achievement medal, in December 1986, and the National Medal of Art, from President Bush in 1990. Directors Adored Her Good Nature         Miss Tandy acted in more than 100 stage productions during her 67-year career, which began in England and encompassed the West End in London as well as the British provinces, Broadway, and the regional theaters that were once so important to the American stage. She appeared in more than 25 movies and played the leading role in a number of television programs, developing from a diffident neophyte into an actress sure of her craft, a star adored by directors for her serenity. There was no temperament; there were no tantrums. Elia Kazan, her director in "Streetcar" said: "She's absolutely sweet-natured. She does her job; she has a sense of humor."         With each performance her reviews got better. "I think I've gotten better," she said when she was 77. "I've gotten more confident in myself in the last five to six years. Earlier I think I distrusted myself. I'd be in things I felt weren't being done right and I didn't speak up. Now I do. I think people trust me."         Miss Tandy, who became an American citizen in 1954, was born in London on June 7, 1909. Her father died when she was 12 and her mother took clerical and teaching jobs at night to supplement her regular income as headmistress of a school for retarded children. She and her two older brothers were read to a lot, Miss Tandy recalled in 1986: "good stuff, poetry."         "I had an appreciation of the words. We were also taken to theater. I sat in a lot of galleries. It was a magical time, but toward the end I would get fidgety and nervous. I never wanted it to end." She also grew to love Shakespeare, one of the few in her class who did. "Almost everyone would say, 'Oh, God, it's Shakespeare this afternoon.' To me it was heaven."         Her brothers would stage family theatricals in their five-room flat in northeast London, but she said she did not show any promise. "I was a graceless lump," she recalled. "My brothers would always say, 'Oh, Mummy, do we really have to have her in it?' "         Nevertheless, her love of the theater led her to the Ben Greet Academy of Acting where, in 1924, she began three years of dramatic training. She was 18 when she made her professional debut in a small back-room theater in Soho in "The Manderson Girls." The salary was $:2 a week, out of which she somehow had to pay for the five elegant costumes her part required. She managed by sewing them herself.  Thought Herself An Ugly Duckling         She was convinced that she was plain and that there was nothing to be done about it. "I had absolutely no dress sense and no money to indulge it even if I did," she said. Her self-confidence was not enhanced by her many letters of recommendation. She remembered that each one of them said, "Don't be put off by how she looks." But if she ever was an ugly duckling -- and there are many photographs that suggest she was not -- a swan finally emerged, for in her later years she was a handsome woman with gray-white hair and sparkling eyes of cornflower blue. She could look back philosophically, saying: "In a way it was rather good. I didn't get the part of the young ingenue. I got more interesting parts."         In 1929 she made her West End debut in "The Rumor," by Charles Kirkpatrick Munro, but it was in 1932, in the role of Manuela in Christa Winsloe's "Children in Uniform," that she became recognized as a gifted actress. It was a role that also afforded her one of her most treasured moments in the theater. "There was one performance when the audience didn't clap at all, they were so moved," she recalled.         During the 1930's she appeared in more than two dozen contemporary plays, but in the English tradition honed her skill on the classics, especially Shakespeare. In 1934 she was Ophelia to John Gielgud's legendary Hamlet. She was Viola in Tyrone Guthrie's 1937 production of "Twelfth Night" at the Old Vic in London, where she twice shared the stage with Laurence Olivier. In 1940, she returned to the Old Vic as Cordelia with Gielgud in the role of King Lear.         The offer of a role in "The Matriarch" brought her to New York briefly in 1930 for her Broadway debut. Ten years later, when the war in Europe had begun and her eight-year marriage to the actor Jack Hawkins was ending, she settled in the United States. There was the lure of Hollywood, and there was the need to support her 6-year-old daughter, Susan. She was allowed to take only $:10 out of the country, and despite her long list of credits, it was such a struggle to make ends meet that she almost abandoned the stage.         In 1940, while she was appearing in A. J. Cronin's "Jupiter Laughs," a young actor and wealthy man-about-town by the name of Hume Cronyn called on her backstage. Two years later they moved to Hollywood and were married. A son, Chris, was born in 1943 and a daughter, Tandy, in 1945. They, her daughter Susan, five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren survive her, in addition to her husband. Maids' Roles Ended, Thanks to Cronyn         In Hollywood, Mr. Cronyn landed some interesting roles in the movies, but Miss Tandy's career languished. At one point she even told friends she was thinking of giving up acting. She appeared with Mr. Cronyn in "The Seventh Cross" (1944) and played bit parts in several other movies, including the role of a ladies' maid in "Forever Amber" (1947), but having to say lines like "Yes, Mum" and 'No, Mum" in yet another movie became very discouraging, she recalled many years later. "I'd had a good start and I was in the doldrums in Hollywood," she said. "It was not a happy position. I began to feel I had no talent and it was all a pipe dream. It was Hume who got me out of it."         He got her out of it in 1946 when he cast her in "Portrait of a Madonna," a play by Tennessee Williams that he was directing in a small theater in Los Angeles. The rave reviews brought Mr. Williams to Los Angeles from New York, where he was casting his new play, "A Streetcar Named Desire." He wrote in his "Memoirs," "It was instantly apparent to me that Jessica was Blanche."         The play, co-starring Marlon Brando in the role of Stanley Kowalski and Kim Hunter as Blanche's sister, Stella, won rapturous reviews, a Pulitzer Prize and the Drama Critics Circle Award and ran for more than two years on Broadway before going on a national tour. Years later, Mr. Kazan remembered the joy of directing Miss Tandy. "She's perfect," he said. "She never stops working and she's always full of little surprises. She always does things a little better than you think she will."         Mr. Atkinson, writing about Miss Tandy's performance in The New York Times, said, "It does seem almost incredible that she could understand such an elusive part so thoroughly and that she can convey it with so many shades and impulses that are accurate, revealing and true."         A contrary view was expressed by her co-star Mr. Brando in his recently published autobiography. In "Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me," the actor wrote: "I think Jessica and I were both miscast, and between us we threw the play out of balance. Jessica is a very good actress, but I never thought she was believable as Blanche. I didn't think she had the finesse or cultivated femininity that the part required, nor the fragility that Tennessee envisioned."         When "Streetcar" was filmed, the part of Blanche went to Vivien Leigh; it was the only replacement among the Broadway leads. Characters Emerged Slowly From Script         She said that in creating a character, "You have to get over 'how' you're doing it and know 'why' you're doing it. Once you forget about the 'how' you get the appearance of reality." She believed the secret to a character was in the script and that it was the actor's duty to "dig it out." She said: "I'm slow about it. I keep going back to the script, the script, the script."         To Miss Tandy, audience reaction was part of a play. She said, "It's not a matter of whether they're laughing or not but whether they're breathing or not." But audiences, like the theater itself, underwent profound changes during Miss Tandy's years on the stage. "The trouble with the theater," she said in 1986, "is that it's no longer a way of life for an audience. It's just a way to kill an evening." One of the theater's problems, she said, was "we are so inundated with entertainment."         "Now you flick a switch," she continued. "It's not the event it used to be."         She said theater people had contributed to the problem by removing the curtain. "People come into the theater and they sit there watching the first scene and talking about what they've bought in Bloomingdale's that day. When you had a curtain, when the footlights went up on the curtain, and then the curtain itself went up, you were part of an experience."         As for the actors, Miss Tandy said she hated to have to grope her way across a dark stage, stumbling into the furniture, "instead of getting on stage and having a moment to think about what you're going to do." Joe Mankiewicz, the film director who was a longtime friend, said that while Lynn Fontanne always had to make an entrance, "to Jessie the way she was when she got there was what was important."  Loved to Play In the Classics         Miss Tandy was always eager to perform in regional theaters and, with Mr. Cronyn, was among the first to volunteer when Tyrone Guthrie launched his repertory theater in Minneapolis. The participation of stars of their magnitude helped put the stamp of legitimacy on the fledgling regional theater movement. The attraction for the Cronyns and others who followed was the opportunity to do the classics. During the Guthrie's first season in 1963, for example, Miss Tandy played Gertrude in Hamlet, Olga in "The Three Sisters" and the wife of Willy Loman in "Death of a Salesman." She also acted in the Shakespeare festivals in Stratford, Conn., and Stratford, Ontario. In 1983 she starred in a revival of an American classic, Tennessee Williams's "Glass Menagerie." Frank Rich wrote in The New York Times, "You pass up Miss Tandy's Amanda Wingfield only at your own peril."         She hated the experience of seeing herself in the movies. "It's a very humbling experience to watch yourself," she said. But while the satisfaction of film never came close to the joy of a live performance, she said she felt it was important to accept roles that were offered to her; it helped pay expenses when she took parts at minimum pay in Off Broadway houses. She played Mr. Cronyn's wife in four of her most recent films, "Honky Tonk Freeway," (1981) "Cocoon," (1984), "Batteries Not Included" (1987) and "Cocoon: The Return" (1988). In 1991, Miss Tandy, then 82, played an indomitable 82-year-old woman in "Fried Green Tomatoes."         Miss Tandy co-starred with her husband in 10 plays on Broadway and dozens of Off Broadway and regional productions during their 52-year marriage. Wherever they went they were asked how they tolerated so much togetherness. "It's hard sometimes," she acknowledged, "but we always manage to give ourselves space. We don't live in each other's pockets. We don't take the play home with us. We do make suggestions to each other, and if we don't agree we respect each other's views." She burst out laughing and recalled Dame Sybil Thorndike's response when asked whether she ever considered divorcing her husband, with whom she had long shared the stage. "Divorce? Never. Murder? Frequently."         In her 70's and even into her 80's, Miss Tandy continued to take on strenuous parts, despite increased difficulty with memorization and stage fright that had got worse rather than better. Even a double cataract operation in 1973 and a cardiovascular problem that caused her collapse onstage during a performance of "Foxfire" in Los Angeles in 1985 did not slow her down. Nor did major surgery for cancer in 1991. She appeared in the television movies "The Story Lady" (1991) and "To Dance With the White Dog" (1993) and completed three more feature films: "Used People" (1992) and "Camilla" and "Nobody's Fool," which are to be released this fall.         "Jessie adores working," Mr. Cronyn said in 1986. "She's more fully alive when she's working." As she got older she seemed to be in ever greater demand, but over the years she took good parts and she took bad parts. "You are richer for doing things," she said. "If you wait for the perfect part or for what sends you, you will have long waits, and you deteriorate. You can't be an actor without acting." A DEDICATED LIFE IN THE PUBLIC EYE         During a 67-year acting career in Britain and the United States, Jessica Tandy appeared in more than 100 plays, more than 25 movies and numerous television shows. Here is a sampling.  THEATER  Hamlet (1934)  King Lear (1940)  Portrait of a Madonna (1946)  A Streetcar Named Desire (1947)  The Fourposter (1951)  Five Finger Exercise (1959)  The Gin Game (1977)  The Glass Menagerie (1983)  The Petition (1986)  FILM  The Seventh Cross (1944)  Forever Amber (1947)  September Affair (1950)  The Desert Fox (1951)  The Light in the Forest (1958)  The Birds (1963)  Butley (1974)  Still of the Night (1982)  The World According to Garp (1982)  The Bostonians (1984)  Cocoon (1985)  Driving Miss Daisy (1989)  Fried Green Tomatoes (1991)  TELEVISION  Foxfire (1987)  The Story Lady (1991)  To Dance With the White Dog (1993)         Correction:  September 14, 1994, Wednesday         A picture caption on Monday with the obituary of Jessica Tandy referred incorrectly in some editions to her appearance in the film "Driving Miss Daisy." The year was 1989. In some editions the obituary also misstated the year for the film "Fried Green Tomatoes." It was 1991.       
         Faith Cardwell Davis, who with her sisters Hope Cardwell Brock and Charity Cardwell Lawson had been listed in the Guinness Book of Records as the world's oldest complete set of triplets, died on Sunday at Rolling Plains Memorial Hospital in Sweetwater, Tex. She was 95.         The cause of death was believed to be a heart attack, said Dan McCoy, director of McCoy Funeral Home in Sweetwater.         The three sisters had lived together for more than a decade at a nursing home in Sweetwater, a small city on the plains of West Texas.         Several experts on multiple births said that when the Cardwell sisters turned 95 last May, they were the first set of triplets on record to reach that age.         Mrs. Davis had owned and operated the Silver Spur diner in Roby, Tex., for 25 years before moving to nearby Sweetwater in the early 1980's.         Her husband, J. P. Davis, whom she married in 1920, died in 1980, and her son, James, died in 1986. She is survived by her sisters; two granddaughters, and three great-grandsons.       
         Merrinelle Sullivan, a past president and longtime officer of the National Council of Women of the United States, died on Sunday in her Manhattan home. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said Robert Sonderskov, a family friend.         At her death, Mrs. Sullivan represented the International Council of Women, an umbrella organization for 78 national councils worldwide, to the United Nations Family Committee.         She had been executive director of the National Council in New York for 18 years before being elected president. As such, she oversaw its activities in New York and Washington in 1988, when both the national and international groups, which lobby for women's causes, observed their 100th anniversaries.         Although her cancer was diagnosed seven years ago, Mrs. Sullivan led an active life, working with women's groups and other organizations. She attended meetings in Indonesia, Cairo and Paris within the last year.         She also continued to work for the Manhattan League, Helen Keller Services for the Blind, Nightingale-Bamford School Volunteers and Mount Sinai Hospital.         Born Merrinelle Rice in Little Rock, Ark., she attended Stephens College in Missouri. Before her marriage in 1961, she managed a hotel in Cape May, N.J., and worked for a New York advertising agency.         She is survived by her husband, Robert A., and two daughters, Amanda, of Manhattan and Susan, a student at the University of Colorado at Boulder.       
         Martha Raye, the big-mouthed, big-hearted entertainer whose career spanned the decades from vaudeville to videos, died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 78.         In recent years, she had suffered a serious of ailments, including a stroke and circulatory difficulties. Ron Wise, a spokesman for Cedars-Sinai, said, "Her death was an aggregate of that and other problems."         Miss Raye sang, she danced, she acted on Broadway, in Hollywood and on television, but the knockabout comic won perhaps her greatest renown as an indefatigable trouper who traveled thousands of miles through three wars to lift the morale of America's fighting forces.         "They ask so little and give so much," she said during the Vietnam War. "The least we can do back home here is give them the love, the respect and the dignity that they, our flag and our country deserve."         Her real name was Margie Yvonne Reed. She was born on Aug. 27, 1916, into a show-business family in the charity ward of a hospital in Butte, Mont. Her father and mother, Pete Reed and the former Peggy Hooper, were Irish immigrants whose song-and-dance routine, under the name Reed and Hooper, took them to carnivals and vaudeville houses around the United States.         "I didn't work until I was 3," Miss Raye was to say years later. "But after that, I never stopped."         Her mother taught her to read and write while the family, which also included her sister and brother, crisscrossed the country. From time to time, she attended schools in Montana, Chicago and New York.         "Our home was in an old, broken down Pierce Arrow auto which my father drove," Miss Raye remembered. "We put the scenery in the back seat and that was where we slept at night. We cooked on Sterno. And we went from town to town, looking for bookings."         She played burlesque houses, nightclubs and saloons, where she said she worked for tips only. "On a good night, I made a dollar," she said. "On a bad one, 25 cents."         At 15, she was singing, dancing and clowning in a children's act. She picked the name Martha Raye from a phone book and piled up the credits. She was a member of the Benny Davis Revue and the Ben Blue Company, a trouper on the Loew's vaudeville circuit, a member of the Will Morrisey act and a feature performer in "Earl Carroll's Sketchbook" and "Calling All Stars."         Eventually she made her way to Hollywood. And on one of the Sunday nights when stars gathered and entertained one another at the Trocadero nightclub, she got a couple of her friends to play straightmen to her comedy. Their names were Jimmy Durante and Joe E. Lewis. The producer Norman Taurog saw her perform, and the next day she was working with Bing Crosby on the 1936 film "Rhythm on the Range." She did a slapstick drunk scene and sang a song called "Mr. Paganini," and became a star overnight.         Miss Raye appeared in films like "Waikiki Wedding," "College Holiday," "Give Me a Sailor," "Keep 'em Flying" and "Hellzapoppin." In 1940, she starred on Broadway opposite Al Jolson in the revue "Hold Onto Your Hats." She appeared on his radio show and the programs of Eddie Cantor and Bob Hope.         During World War II, she began entertaining troops, and the 1944 film "Four Jills in a Jeep" was based on a U.S.O. tour of bases in England and Africa she made in the company of Kay Francis, Carole Landis and Mitzi Mayfair.         In 1969, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gave Miss Raye the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award for her wartime efforts, and she was given the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1993.         She was not happy about her Hollywood career, except for "Monsieur Verdoux," Charlie Chaplin's controversial 1947 black comedy about a Parisian Bluebeard who marries and kills for money. "I must have made 35 or 40 movies and most of them were mindless," Miss Raye said. "But in those days actors didn't fight the system; then we thought we were lucky to be under contract."         Her performance in "Verdoux," in which she portrayed Annabella Bonheur, a raucous, indestructible wife of the killer, was praised as brilliant by Bosley Crowther of The New York Times. "Do you know," she recalled in 1972, "that when Chaplin called to offer me the part, I hung up on him; I thought it was a joke."         She blamed her decline in Hollywood on executives who focused on her shapely legs and ability to fill out a sweater. "They tried to make a glamour girl out of me," the brown-haired, blue-eyed actress complained. "Let's face it, I'm not a glamour girl. I'm a clown."         Despite her setbacks in Hollywood, she was far from finished. Milton Berle gave her a start in television, and by 1954, she was the medium's reigning female comedian. Ahead of her was more success in nightclubs, cabaret and theater.         Offstage, life was darker. "As an entertainer, she's a genius," one of her colleagues once said. "Socially, she's completely unsure of herself."         She married again and again. Among her husbands were the makeup artist Buddy Westmore, the composer David Rose, the businessman Neal Lang, the dancers Nick Condos and Edward Begley and the policeman Robert O'Shea. Her last marriage was in 1991, to 42-year-old Mark Harris, her manager.         She had a daughter, Melody, by Mr. Condos. After Miss Raye suffered a stroke in 1991, she and Melody battled in court over control of the actress's money. In July 1992, Miss Raye filed a lawsuit alleging that the 1991 Bette Midler-James Caan film "For the Boys" wrongfully appropriated her life story. A judge dismissed the $5 million complaint earlier this year.         In her later years, many people knew Miss Raye as the star of Polident commercials.         She is survived by her husband and her daughter.       
         Kaleria Fedicheva, a former ballerina with the Kirov Ballet in Leningrad who taught and staged the classics in the United States, died on Sept. 13 in Maribor, Slovenia, where she had been seeking medical treatment. She was 58 years old and lived in Glen Cove, L.I.         Ms. Fedicheva died of cancer, said Martin Fredmann, her former husband and the artistic director of the Colorado Ballet in Denver.         Ms. Fedicheva belonged to the generation of Kirov stars, including Rudolf Nureyev, Natalia Makarova, Yuri Soloviev and Alla Sizova, who created a sensation in the West in the 1960's. After graduating from the Kirov school in 1955, Ms. Fedicheva excelled in 19th-century classics that showed off her dynamism, like "Raymonda," and she drew immediate acclaim during the Kirov's first seasons in New York in 1961 and 1964. Unlike her younger partner Mikhail Baryshnikov and Mr. Nureyev and Ms. Makarova, Ms. Fedicheva did not defect while touring abroad.         But after she married Mr. Fredmann, an American dancer studying at the Kirov, in 1974, Soviet authorities, saying she was not divorced from her first husband, blocked her exit visa to the United States for a year. Her case received international attention after she was beaten by two men outside her apartment in what was then Leningrad, in what she said was an attempt to intimidate her. The Soviet Government permitted her to leave in February 1975 with her son, Ivan.         Ms. Fedicheva and Mr. Fredmann were divorced four years later but remained good friends, and she staged an acclaimed production of "Giselle" for the Colorado Ballet last year.         Ms. Fedicheva staged other works from the Russian repertory and choreographed new ones in the United States and abroad after she opened the New Russian School in Sea Cliff, L.I., after her arrival. She also directed her students and professional guest artists in the Fedicheva Ballet Company of Glen Cove, which was founded in 1982. The group's annual production of "The Nutcracker" was seen in New York City and on Long Island.         As a dancer, Ms. Fedicheva was at her best when her technical brilliance came to the fore in ballets like "Laurencia" and "Don Quixote." Yet she also excelled in "La Bayadere" and performed regularly in classics like "Swan Lake" and in contemporary Soviet ballets.         In addition to her son, Ms. Fedicheva is survived by her mother in St. Petersburg, Russia.       
         Helene Thurman Martin Heinemann, a retired geriatric social worker, died on Thursday at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa., near Philadelphia. She was 88 and lived in New Canaan and Washington, Conn., before moving to Crosslands in 1977.         Her death followed a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Heinemann, a native of Harrisburg, Pa., graduated from Wellesley College and the New York School of Social Work.         She is survived by a son, H. Erich Heinemann of Great Neck, L.I., chief economist at Ladenburg, Thalmann & Company, investment bankers; a daughter, Marianne Russo of Oxford, Pa., and Wilmington, Del.; a brother, Frederick Martin of Orono, Me.; seven grandchildren, and one great-grandson.         Her husband, Hans Heinemann, an investment banker, died in 1967.       
         Mary G. Roebling, former chairwoman of the National State Bank, one of New Jersey's largest independent banks, and a former governor of the American Stock Exchange, died on Tuesday at her home in Trenton. She was 89.         The cause was renal failure, The Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Roebling retired in 1984 as chairman of the National State Bank in Elizabeth, N.J., which then had assets of $1.2 billion.         Earlier, she became the first woman to head a major American bank, the Trenton Trust Company. In 1937, at the age of 30, she was named its president. It grew substantially and she was its president or chairman or both until 1972, when Trenton Trust was acquired by National State. She was then elected chairman of the combined institutions.         Mrs. Roebling was also a founder, in 1978, of the Women's Bank N.A. of Denver, the first nationally chartered bank founded by women. She went on to serve as its chairman until 1983. In addition, she was the American Stock Exchange's first woman governor, from 1958 to 1962.         Mrs. Roebling also served as a director of numerous other corporations over the years, was active in many civic, charitable and educational organizations, and was a tireless advocate of a greater role for women in the country's economic affairs.         In a speech in 1965, Mrs. Roebling said: "As a woman who for years has competed in the business world, I would be the first to agree that the American woman has almost unbelievable economic power, but American women, like women of all civilized nations, do not use the influence their economic power gives them."         Mrs. Roebling's own economic power came initially through inheritance, but she increased it vastly once it fell into her hands. She was bequeathed a large block of Trenton Trust stock by her millionaire second husband, Siegfried Roebling, whose family had long been prominent in engineering and cable manufacturing. He was a great-grandson of John A. Roebling, who designed the Brooklyn Bridge, and a grandson of Col. Washington A. Roebling, who completed its construction.         Siegfried Roebling died in 1936, of a heart attack. Mrs. Roebling's father and father-in-law then urged her to try her hand at running the bank. She had preparation for the job: she had worked for a Philadelphia investment house while taking business courses at night and, the two men told her, she had another important qualification, common sense.         The rest was banking history. She took her husband's seat on the bank's board and, on Jan. 21, 1937, was elected president.         "Mary G. Roebling didn't wait for women's lib," Forbes magazine once wrote, "she was ahead of it, way ahead."         By 1970, Mrs. Roebling estimated that 300 other American women had become presidents or chairwomen of banks. But in 1978, when she became chairwoman of the Women's Bank, she argued that there still was a place in the business world for banks that were operated specifically for female customers.         "Women's banks can be better listeners for women and give them more time, advice and direction than an ordinary bank would give," she told an interviewer. "It's a psychological thing, really."         She continued to be active in male-dominated spheres, however: in 1978, after having served as a civilian aide to the Secretary of the Army in several administrations, she became the founding president of the newly formed Army War College Foundation. It was set up to support the college's fund-raising and other activities.         She was born Mary Gindhart in 1907 in West Collingswood, N.J., the daughter of Isaac D. Gindhart Jr., a telephone company executive, and Mary Simon Gindhart, a music teacher. She went to public schools in Haddonfield and Moorestown, N.J., and earned pocket money picking strawberries for a penny a box.         While still a teen-ager, she married a musician, Arthur Herbert, but he died three years later, leaving her with a daughter to support. She went to work in Philadelphia and took evening courses in merchandising and business administration at the University of Pennsylvania.         She left her job when she married Mr. Roebling, becoming a housewife again until his death.         Over the years, Mrs. Roebling was variously a director of the Tattersall Corporation, the Standard Fire Insurance Company and the Colonial Operating Company, in Trenton, among other concerns; an officer of the New York World's Fair Corporation in 1964 and 1965; a member of the National Business Council on Consumer Affairs and of the Boy Scouts of America's national advisory council, and an active participant in other nonprofit organizations. She was awarded numerous honorary degrees and other honors.         She is survived by a daughter, Betty Hobin of Palm Beach, Fla., and Hopewell Township, N.J.; five grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and a sister, Margaret G. Finley of Haddonfield, N.J. A son, Paul Roebling, died in July.       
         Ruth Blumka, a prominent New York dealer in medieval and Renaissance art and a donor of artworks to museums around the country, died on Monday at New York University Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, said her son, Anthony Blumka.         Among the works donated to the Metropolitan Museum by Mrs. Blumka and her husband, Leopold, were a 15th-century silver tabernacle produced for the Monastery of St. Peter at Salzburg and a rare enameled devotional cradle made in the Netherlands in the 15th century.         After her husband's death in 1973, Mrs. Blumka donated other objects, including, in 1991, a German 15th-century tapestry from the altar of a Nuremberg church.         "It's a great loss," Philippe de Montebello, the director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said yesterday. "Ruth Blumka was really an art dealer of the old school with a tremendous knowledge of the works of art she handled and an extremely good eye. And she placed a number of great objects, both through sale and gift in the Metropolitan Museum and elsewhere."         The Blumkas also made gifts of art objects and antiques to the Walters Art Gallery in Baltimore, the Philadelphia Museum of Art, the National Gallery in Washington, the Minneapolis Museum of Art, the Cincinnati Art Museum and the Louvre in Paris. She was a member of the National Antique and Art Dealers Association of America and a participant in the International Fine Art and Antique Dealers Show each year since its founding in 1989.         Mrs. Blumka, whose name was originally Ruth Zickel, was born and reared in Munich, the daughter of Nadja and Frederic Zickel, dealers in German Expressionist art. She came to New York in 1939, and in 1942 began to work for Mr. Blumka at his East 57th Street gallery.         Mr. Blumka introduced her to medieval and Renaissance art, the field in which his family had specialized in Vienna for several generations. She remained at the gallery after their marriage a decade later. The gallery is now at 101 East 81st Street.         The Blumkas counted among their clients Robert Lehman, Belle and Jack Linsky, Marjorie Merriweather Post and Anne Johnson when she was the wife of Henry Ford 2d.         In addition to her son, a New York art dealer, she is survived by three grandchildren, Kimberly and Justin Nasatir and Amanda Goldberg, and a brother, John Zickel of Carmichael, Calif.       
         Nora Jaffe, a painter and sculptor, died on Friday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 66 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, said her daughter, Lee.         A recurring theme in Mrs. Jaffe's work was the male nude, the subject of her first oil painting, when she was 12. Largely self-taught (although she studied briefly with Samuel Adler and David Hare), she began showing her art in 1960. Since then, she had been in group and solo shows at the Museum of Modern Art, the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts, the Brooklyn Museum and galleries. Her last show was at the Virginia Lust Gallery in 1990.         She did the covers for books by the poets Adrienne Rich and Clayton Eshelman.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Joseph, and a son, Kenneth A., all of New York City, and three brothers, Jeff Miller and Jack Miller of Delphos, Ohio, and Tom Miller of Arlington, Va.       
         Elizabeth George Speare, an author of historical novels for children, died yesterday in Northwest General Hospital in Tucson, Ariz. She was 84.         The cause was an aortic aneurysm, her family said.         Beginning in 1957 with "Calico Captive," Mrs. Speare wrote a string of novels that soon became familiar to thousands of American schoolchildren. Two of her early works, "The Witch of Blackbird Pond" (1958) and "The Bronze Bow" (1961), were awarded the Newbery Medal by the American Library Association.         Among her other novels were "Life in Colonial America" (1964) and "The Prospering" (1967).         Mrs. Speare's last book, "The Sign of the Beaver" (1983), also won the Newbery Medal, as well as the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction.         In 1989, Mrs. Speare was awarded the Laura Ingalls Wilder Medal for her "distinguished, enduring contribution to children's literature." The award cited her "vitality and energy, grace of writing, historical accuracy, and tremendous feeling for place and character."         Her novels have continued to be required reading in classrooms across the country. Her subjects ranged from a boy heroically trying to drive the Romans from Israel to another boy's efforts to survive alone in the wilderness of colonial Maine.         "I have chosen to write historical novels, chiefly, I think, because I enjoy sharing with young people my own ever-fresh astonishment at finding that men and women and boys and girls who lived through the great events of the past were exactly like ourselves, and that they faced every day the same choices, large and small, which daily confront us," she wrote in the New York Times Book Review in 1961.         Mrs. Speare was born in 1908 and reared in Melrose, Mass. She attended Smith College and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from Boston University.         She wrote a number of magazine articles and two one-act plays before winning her first award in 1957 with the publication of "Calico Captive," the story of a young woman in 1794 who was carried away to Canada after an Indian raid.         Mrs. Speare is survived by her husband, Alden, and a daughter, Mary Elizabeth Carey of Shaker Heights, Ohio.         Correction:  November 18, 1994, Friday         An obituary on Wednesday about Elizabeth George Speare, an author of historical novels for children, misidentified an award received by her last book, "The Sign of the Beaver" (1983). It was a Newbery Honor Medal from the American Library Association, not a Newbery Medal. The association awarded its top honor, the Newbery Medal, to two of Mrs. Speare's other books.       
         Amelia Dietrich Lewis, a lawyer who helped reshape the American juvenile justice system, died on Wednesday at St. Joseph's Hospital in Phoenix. She was 91 and lived in nearby Scottsdale.         She had suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Lewis argued a landmark 1967 case in which the United States Supreme Court ruled that juveniles charged with criminal offenses were entitled to the same procedural protections in juvenile courts that adults enjoyed in the criminal courts.         The case, In re Gault, dated from 1964, when a 15-year-old boy in Globe, Ariz., was accused of making a lewd telephone call to a woman in his neighborhood. Adjudged a delinquent, he faced detention in a reformatory until he turned 21, punishment that was coincidentally far greater than a similarly charged adult, enjoying greater courtroom protections, would have faced.         Mrs. Lewis took the case after the family of the boy, Gerald Gault, had virtually exhausted its appeals. The American Civil Liberties Union and its Arizona affiliate underwrote the effort, but Mrs. Lewis paid her way to Washington and her expenses there. She later said she had been drawn to the case because "I have raised three healthy sons, and I wanted to give something back."         In its 7-to-2 decision in Gerald's favor, the Supreme Court held that he was entitled to the constitutional safeguards that he had been denied: the right to legal counsel, the right to cross-examine witnesses and the right to remain silent.         "Neither the 14th Amendment nor the Bill of Rights is for adults only," Justice Abe Fortas wrote for the majority. "Under our Constitution, the condition of being a boy does not justify a kangaroo court."         Mrs. Lewis was born in the Bronx, received her law degree from St. Lawrence Law School (now Brooklyn Law School) and became one of the few women to be admitted to the New York bar in the early 1920's. She practiced in New York for 33 years and was working in the city's juvenile justice system when her husband, Maxwell Lewis, died in 1957.         She then moved to Arizona, where she took the bar examination with just one other woman, Sandra Day O'Connor, who in 1981 became the first woman on the Supreme Court. Mrs. Lewis continued to practice until two years ago.         She is survived by her three sons, Dr. David Lewis of Linkoping, Sweden, Frank Lewis of Phoenix, and Peter Lewis of Baltimore; a sister, Ernestine D. Hanwell of Atlanta; a brother, Paul Dietrich of Ridge, L.I.; eight grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 8, 1994, Thursday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Nov. 19 about Amelia Dietrich Lewis, a former lawyer, misstated her role in a 1967 Supreme Court case that established that juveniles have essentially the same Constitutional safeguards in criminal proceedings as adults. Mrs. Lewis was co-counsel; Prof. Norman Dorsen of New York University Law School presented oral arguments on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.       
         Janet Ahlberg, who created the illustrations for a series of memorable children's books written by her husband, Allan, died on Tuesday in Leicester, England. She was 50.         The cause was cancer, said a statement from the Ahlbergs' publisher, Little, Brown & Company.         Together, Mrs. Ahlberg and her husband produced more than 40 books for young readers. Their first effort, "The Brick Street Boys," appeared in 1975 and was followed by, among others, "Burglar Bill," "Each Peach Pear Plum," "Funnybones," "Peepo!" and "The Baby's Catalogue."         "The Jolly Postman," published in 1986, was highly successful. The rhyming story featured a mailman on a bicycle who delivers letters to familiar fairy tale characters. Inside the book were envelopes with amusing surprises, including a letter of apology from Goldilocks to the Three Bears. "The Jolly Postman" sold more than a million copies and was followed in 1991 by "The Jolly Christmas Postman."         In The New York Times Book Review, Daniel Menaker praised the sequel as "a mild, sweet, amusing book" and said "the authors have taken the secrets of the first book's popularity -- cleverness, detail, surprise and humor -- and amplified them."         Mrs. Ahlberg had completed work on a third volume, "Jolly Pocket Postman," which is to be published next fall by Little, Brown.         She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Jessica.       
         Viola Spolin, who as a teacher and author was an inspiration for the improvisational theater movement, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 88.         Her sister, Beatrice Lees, said Mrs. Spolin had three strokes in recent years.         Through her theater games and her book "Improvisations for the Theater" as well as the subsequent work of her son Paul Sills at the Compass and Second City in Chicago and with Story Theater, Mrs. Spolin influenced several generations of actors and directors, including Mike Nichols, Elaine May, Alan Arkin, Severn Darden, Barbara Harris, Anthony Holland, Paul Sand and Avery Schreiber. Although she did not have a career as a professional director, her guidance as a vital and highly demonstrative teacher was to indispensable as actors increasingly responded to the idea of improv.         Various comic techniques came later, but she was a primary source of the practical mechanics of theater games, exercises designed to free actors. Explaining her approach, she once said, "My vision is a world of accessible intuition." Mr. Sills said his mother wanted "to help players hit their intuition" and become more spontaneous.         Most of Mrs. Spolin's theater work was with children. She was born in Chicago, where she trained with Neva Boyd, an educator who used games to help children adjust to life in the city. Mrs. Spolin added the idea of theater games, exercises that led to role-playing. Later she worked for the W.P.A. When Mr. Sills joined David Shepherd in creating the Compass improvisational theater, his mother's games became part of the work process.         Since 1945 Mrs. Spolin had lived in Los Angeles, where she founded the Young Actors Company, which is both a school and theater. She retired in 1980. "Improvisations for the Theater," her best-known book (published by Northwestern University Press) remains a standard theatrical text.         In addition to her sister, of New York City, and her son Paul, of Baileys Harbor, Wis., she is survived by her third husband, Robert Kolmus Greene; another son, William Sills of Oakland, Calif.; seven grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Joanne Rathgeb, an actress, director and educator who fought for greater awareness and increased resources to fight breast cancer, died of the disease on Nov. 19 at her home in Essex Junction, Vt. She was 64.         Her cancer was diagnosed nine years ago, but she continued an active life. She retired last year as a professor of fine arts and drama at St. Michael's College in Colchester after 30 years on the faculty. She was the first woman to head the fine arts department there.         Vermont has the eighth highest rate of death from breast cancer in the nation, but Mrs. Rathgeb's prominence as a campaigner against the disease extended beyond her home state. She collected about 14,000 letters that were delivered to the Congressional delegation from Vermont. The letters called for increased research and a cancer registry.         In 1992, she started a cancer registry in Vermont, and Congress passed the Cancer Registries Act, which established a national standard for the collection of cancer data.         Mrs. Rathgeb was born in Terre Haute, Ind., and earned a bachelor's degree in theater and a master's degree in English at Indiana State University. She did post-graduate work at Catholic University of America, taught in the Chicago public schools and helped to organize theaters in Terre Haute.         Early in her career, she joined National Players and took part in productions of "The Taming of the Shrew," "Twelfth Night" and "Oedipus Rex" in Europe and in this country, including a performance at the Carnegie Hall Playhouse in Manhattan. She later returned to New York to appear in Phoenix Theater productions of "Peer Gynt" and "Lysistrata."         Since 1958, she had been a producer, director, coach and actress at St. Michael's Playhouse in Vermont.         Mrs. Rathgeb is survived by her husband of 34 years, Donald Sr.; three daughters, Elizabeth Pratt of Amesbury, Mass., and Laura Rathgeb and Mary Jo Balaskas, both of Manhattan; a son, Donald Jr. of Burlington, Vt.; a sister, Laura Mae Hellrung of Alton, Ill.; a brother, Howard Ellspermann of Cape Coral, Fla., and one granddaughter.       
         Priscilla Morrill, a stage and television actress, died on Nov. 9 at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 67 and lived in Port Hueneme, Calif.         The cause was complications of a kidney infection, said her agent, Richard Bauman.         Ms. Morrill was born and reared in Boston. She graduated from the Carnegie Institute in Pittsburgh. She made her stage debut with the Brattle Theater Company in Cambridge, Mass., in "Julius Caesar," with John Carradine, and first appeared on Broadway in the company's revival of "The Relapse," with Cyril Ritchard. She later appeared Off Broadway in "The Duchess of Malfi," "Love's Labour's Lost" and "A Touch of the Poet."         On television, she played Lou Grant's wife on "The Mary Tyler Moore Show" and appeared on "Newhart," "Coach," "Blossom" and "Mr. Belvedere." She was also in the television movies "Marilyn" and "The Trial of Jean Harris."         She is survived by her husband, Paul Bryson.       
         Elenore Hangley, a former executive vice president of the Advertising Council, died on Saturday at the Englewood Hospital and Medical Center, in Englewood, N.J. She was 63 and lived in Cliffside, N.J.         The cause of death was cancer, said her husband, Charles.         Mrs. Hangley spent her 30-year career with the Advertising Council, which is responsible for the nation's public service advertising campaigns. At the council, she developed and managed advertising campaigns like the one involving McGruff, the dog who promoted anti-crime activities. She was also responsible for the council's overall operations.         Mrs. Hangley, a native of Union City, N.J., and a graduate of Hunter College, began work at the Advertising Council in 1951. In 1965, she left her position as a radio and television services manager to rear her son. She returned as an advertising campaign manager 12 years later and in 1980 was named director of campaign administration.         In 1982, she was appointed vice president of the council. Seven years later, she was named senior vice president of campaign administration and then, in the same year, was named executive vice president of operations. In 1993, she retired.         At the time of her death, she was the president of the board of directors of Child Find America, which tries to find runaways and missing children, and a member of the steering committee of the National Crime Prevention Council, for which the McGruff anti-crime advertisements were designed.         Besides her husband, she is survived by her son, Charles, of Cliffside, N.J., and her sister, Norma Kramer of New York City.       
         Alice Miller, the director of the Brooklyn College Women's Center since 1985, died on Monday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 46 and lived in the Carroll Gardens section of Brooklyn.         The cause was cancer, said Richard Coniglione, a spokesman for Brooklyn College.         The Women's Center, which provides various services for students, teachers and others, acts as an advocate for women on issues like educational equity and sexual harassment. The center also co-sponsors lectures and conferences on topics like women's health, professions and the arts.         In 1987, Ms. Miller founded the Eureka Teen Achievement Program, which the college describes as "a math and science enrichment program for minority and disadvantaged teen-age women." The program has been emulated elsewhere around the country.         From 1986 to 1988, she was on the board of Women's Survival Space, a shelter for battered women.         A native New Yorker, Ms. Miller, whose maiden name was Lokiec, graduated from Barnard College in 1968 and earned an M.A. from Columbia University Teachers College and from New York University.         She taught in junior and senior high schools, was an editor and a freelance writer and was director of the women's center and adult education at the Brooklyn Y.W.C.A. before heading the college's women's center.         Her survivors include her husband, Sandy Miller, and a daughter, Nell Miller, also of Carroll Gardens.       
         Elinor F. Poindexter, a Manhattan dealer in contemporary art, died on Sunday at her home in Easton, Conn. She was 88.         The cause was pneumonia, said her son, Joseph.         Before she became a dealer, Mrs. Poindexter collected the works of both abstract and figurative painters with her husband, George, a commodities broker. He died in 1975.         She founded the Poindexter Gallery in 1955 and showed the works of New York and California artists like Richard Diebenkorn, Al Held, Jules Olitski, Nell Blaine and Robert De Niro. The gallery closed in 1978.         Mrs. Poindexter, originally Elinor Fuller, was born in Montreal, but grew up on Staten Island. She was graduated from Finch College in Manhattan.         Earlier this year, she donated 36 acres in Easton to the Aspetuck Land Trust, the largest such gift ever to the Fairfield County Land Conservancy.         In addition to her son, of Brooklyn, she is survived by two daughters, Leslie of Cincinnati and Christie Dennis of Cambridge, Mass.; a sister, Leslie Randall of Newton, Conn., and eight grandchildren.       
         Beatrice Kneeland, who helped to establish the Hartford College for Women in 1939 and had served as a trustee since then, died on Sunday at the Cherry Brook Health Center in Canton, Conn. She was 99 and lived in Bloomfield.         The cause of death was congestive heart failure, said her niece, Annabelle Hall Noland of Oakton, Va.         In 1939, when Mount Holyoke College announced the closing of its Hartford campus, Mrs. Kneeland was among a small group of people that raised money to establish an independent college. Begun as a two-year liberal arts college, it became part of the University of Hartford system in 1991.         Her husband, Henry Tracy Kneeland, died in 1986.       
         Jeanne Sumner Newman, a public health specialist who worked to improve medical services in developing countries, died on Oct. 24 at West Virginia University Hospitals in Morgantown, W.Va. She was 65 and lived in Baltimore.         She died from injuries suffered in a car accident on Oct. 7, said her daughter Katharine Newman Zohir. Dr. Newman had been traveling to an American Friends Service Committee Retreat in Charleston, W.Va., with her husband, John Brown Newman, who was also injured.         As a consultant to the United States Agency for International Development, she evaluated health care in rural clinics and recommended revisions in supervision and training. In her work, she expanded the role of nursing technicians, who often were the only health workers in isolated places.         She is also survived by another daughter, Pixie A. B. Newman of Chicago, a son, Jon of Glen Rock, Pa., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Judith Krieger Gardner, a child psychologist, teacher and researcher at Brandeis University, died of an aneurysm on Saturday at the Hadassah Hospital in Jerusalem. She was 51 and lived in Belmont and West Tisbury, Mass.         She fell ill three weeks ago on a trek in Nepal with friends, her family said.         Dr. Gardner was an associate research professor at the Heller Graduate School of Advanced Studies and Social Welfare at Brandeis; she was acting director of the school two years ago.         She also taught a course on the history of child rearing at Harvard University and lectured at Boston University.         Born in Philadelphia, she graduated magna cum laude from the Connecticut College for Women in 1964 and earned a Ph.D. in psychology at Harvard in 1971.         Dr. Gardner was a former research associate at Children's Hospital in Boston and a staff psychologist at the Judge Baker Center in Boston.         She was co-editor with Howard Gardner, her former husband, of many books, including the multivolume series "Classics in Psychology" and "Classics in Child Psychology" published by Ayer.         Dr. Gardner is survived by her daughter, Kerith, of Manhattan; two sons, Jay and Andrew of Belmont, and her parents, Sylvia and Bernard Krieger of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Elizabeth (Biddie) Kramer, a philanthropist who spent most of her life raising millions of dollars for the nation of Israel, died on Monday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 86.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         In 1949, Mrs. Kramer and her husband, Benjamin Abrams, the founder and chairman of the Emerson Radio Corporation, visited Israel. At a meeting with Prime Minister David Ben Gurion and Finance Minister Eliezer Kaplan , Mr. Abrams suggested issuing bonds to help finance the new nation.         As a result of that conversation, the Israel Bond Campaign was born.  From its inception and for years after Mr. Abrams's death in 1967, Mrs. Kramer remained deeply involved in the campaign, serving at various times as a co-chairwoman, honoree and fund-raiser. Mark Ruben, executive director for Israel Bonds of the Greater Palm Beaches, credited her with raising tens of millions of dollars for Israel.         Mrs. Kramer was also involved in various educational projects, serving as a member of the board of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and as vice president of the American Friends of the Hebrew University, which bestowed on her the Scopus Award and an honorary doctorate of philosophy in 1984.         She was also the first recipient of the Israel Bond Association's Eleanor Roosevelt Centennial Award for her philanthropic efforts.         A member of Long Island University's board, Mrs. Kramer was a founder of the Benjamin and Elizabeth Abrams Communication Center at the university. She also served on the board of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and as chairwoman of the Women's Division of the United Jewish Appeal in New York City and Palm Beach.         Mrs. Kramer, who survived two other husbands, leaves three daughters, Marjorie Hyman, Geraldine Kory and Cynthia Bernstein, all of New York City; six grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren.       
         Adda Bozeman Barkhuus, a writer and scholar of international relations at Sarah Lawrence College, died last Saturday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 85.         The cause was complications from a stroke, her family said.         She was professor emeritus of history and international relations at Sarah Lawrence, where she taught from 1947 to 1977. Many of her students went on to careers in the Foreign Service.         Professor Bozeman, as she was known professionally, was the author of many articles and papers as well as influential scholarly books. These include "Politics and Culture in International History: From the Ancient Near East to the Opening of the Modern Age," "Strategic Intelligence & Statecraft: Selected Essays," "Conflict in Africa: Concepts & Realities" and "Regional Conflicts Around Geneva," all of which remain in print.         She was a member of the editorial boards of ORBIS, a Journal of World Affairs; Asian Affairs, an American Review, and the Review for Comparative Study of Civilization.         She was born Adda von Bruemmer into a Baltic German family in Geistershof, Latvia, and graduated from l'Ecole Libre des Sciences Politique in Paris. She studied law in England to become a lawyer at the Middle Temple Inn of Court in London. She practiced with an international firm in Berlin, The Hague and London before moving to the United States in the late 1930's.         She received a doctorate in law at Southern Methodist University and did postgraduate studies at the Hoover Institute of Stanford University before being appointed an associate professor of history at Augustana College in Rockville, Ill. She started as a full professor at Sarah Lawrence in 1947.         Professor Bozeman is survived by her husband of 44 years, Dr. Arne Barkhuus; a daughter, Anya B. Taylor of South Nyack, N.Y.; a brother, Bodo von Bruemmer of Colares, Portugal, and two grandsons.       
         Lillian Louise Poses, a lawyer who worked on the New Deal and was long active in public life, died on Sunday in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 86.         The cause was complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Barbara Poses Kafka.         Mrs. Poses was among the first women to graduate from New York University's law school, her daughter said, and joined the New York bar in 1938, soon after it began admitting women, in 1937.         During President Franklin D. Roosevelt's administration, she did legal work for several New Deal agencies.         In later years, she had a private practice in labor law representing several large corporations, and was active in the Governors Task Force on Unemployment, the Council Against Poverty, Unesco and the International League of Human Rights.         Mrs. Poses and her husband, Jack I. Poses, were active in philanthropic undertakings, especially in the arts and education.         Mrs. Poses was born in Brooklyn. She graduated from Hunter College in 1927. Her husband died in 1982.         In addition to her daughter, Ms. Kafka, of Manhattan, she is survived by two grandchildren and a brother, Abraham Shapiro, of Manhattan.       
         By all appearances, this was a great year for Alix Gres, the French fashion designer. There was a retrospective of her work held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute in September, attended by Yuzo Yagi, the chairman of Yagi Tsusho Ltd., the Japanese company that had bought the rights to her name in 1988 and had sponsored the exhibition. In Japan, the company was promoting her name anew.         And she was being heralded by fellow couturiers like Yves Saint Laurent, who marveled at the show in an interview in Women's Wear Daily. Her daughter, Anne Gres (the name is pronounced greh), provided the fashion industry newspaper with a response she said her mother had dictated on Oct. 9. "Coming from an artist and colleague whom I admire," said an excerpt published on Nov. 1, "I'm greatly touched."         So the fashion world was startled to learn yesterday that Mme. Gres, as she is always called by those in her trade, had been dead for more than a year. Born on Nov. 30, 1903, she died on Nov. 24, 1993, in a retirement home in the south of France, a fact that was carefully hidden by her daughter.         In a front-page story in the French newspaper Le Monde, Anne Gres said she had disguised the death of her mother for the last 13 months for two reasons. "First of all, I looked to protect her," she said. "All those who have profited from her would again find the means to draw on her money." The second reason she gave was respect for the older sister of Mme. Gres, who is still alive. She added that she did not yet have the money to buy the sort of tomb that would dignify her mother's memory. "It made me suffer more," she said about hiding the news. "It is like it didn't happen."         No one knew about Mme. Gres's death until the article appeared. Not her closest friends and peers, Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy. Not Jacques Mouclier, the head of the Chambre Syndicale, the governing body of French fashion, where she held the title of honorary president for life. Not Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute exhibition, and not even Mr. Yagi, the owner of the rights to her name.         Those interviewed in Paris as the news spread expressed confusion at the charade, which was revealed when Le Monde uncovered a document in a district mayor's office in Paris confirming her death. It was verified in interviews with residents of the home in St.-Paul-de-Vence where Mme. Gres had lived.         For the French fashion industry, where designer names are often bought and sold without consulting the founders, it is an eerie illustration of how a design house can continue on without its progenitor.         Mme. Gres was the last survivor of her generation of couturiers, which included Madeleine Vionnet, Jeanne Lanvin, Elsa Schiaparelli and Gabrielle Chanel. Although some have asked whether there could have been a commercial reason for her daughter's actions, it seems unlikely, given the number of houses in Paris that continue after the designer has died, from Balenciaga to Chanel and Christian Dior, where big-name designers took over the workrooms.         "It is very difficult to express oneself on hearing such a frightening piece of news," Mr. de Givenchy said in a fax. "I was very shocked to learn of the passing of such a 'grande dame' like this one a year too late. Mme. Gres was a person who was very discreet and very humble, and maybe this was her decision."         Her clients, often the people closest to designers who work in couture, as Mme. Gres did, were especially shocked at the news. Sao Schlumberger, who donated a dress to the Costume Institute for the exhibition, said: "It is quite strange. Some time ago I talked with the Duchess of Orleans, who was a customer of hers and a close friend, and she said she went to visit her in an old people's home. And the first time she recognized her, but the last time she didn't recognize her at all."         One reason Mme. Gres was able to fade away was that she was no longer active in her house, which she sold in 1984 to the French industrialist Bernard Tapie. She later told Mr. Cardin that the decision was the worst she had ever made, recalled Bernard Danillon, the communications director for Pierre Cardin. Mr. Cardin had tried to stay in touch with Mme. Gres, Mr. Danillon said, but "every time that anyone asks about Mme. Gres to Jacques Mouclier, the answer was given by her daughter, and she said always, 'Mme. Gres wants to be quiet, she doesn't want to be disturbed, she doesn't want to talk to anybody.' "         "After years and years of getting this answer, you don't call again," Mr. Danillon said. "You respect someone's wish."         At the Costume Institute, Mr. Martin said he had made two attempts to contact Mme. Gres, one when the show was in the planning stage, the other when it was ready to open, inviting her to come. "We took the Women's Wear Daily response as being the sure indication that Mme. Gres was aware of the show," Mr. Martin said. "Maybe you wouldn't have told people if you were reclusive, but to create a fiction, a fabrication of her being alive? I don't even understand what the purpose would be."         Everyone who wrote about the exhibition discussed the designer in the present tense. Bernadine Morris wrote in The New York Times: "A nonagenarian, she is one of the great female designers who dominated haute couture in Paris until after World War II, when the men took over."         Those who admire her work are feeling haunted, having missed a long mourning period.         "It gives me goose bumps," said Susan Gutfreund, a client of Mme.  Gres who also shared a Paris hairdresser with her. She last saw her four years ago. "Her daughter must have had a reason to hide it, but I find it very sad," she said.         One of the reasons for the deception may have been the resentment that Anne Gres indicated to Le Monde over the way the French fashion industry had reacted in 1987, when her mother's couture house was liquidated after rent on her atelier went unpaid for two years. "No one did anything," Anne Gres said, when wooden mannequins, toiles and partly finished dresses were thrown into trash bags.         The house was emptied in a day. "That day there, she had paid in full, because they had stolen her life," she said.         In 1988, the house was bought by Mr. Yagi. Her daughter condemned the fashion professionals yesterday in Le Monde. "Mme. Gres is the Bosnia of couture," she said, always speaking in the present tense. "Except for Pierre Cardin and Hubert de Givenchy, who has tried to help her?"         Mme. Gres's death is remarkable in the way its secrecy mirrors her life. In interviews throughout her career, she refused to reveal her age, her parents' backgrounds (her grandparents were said to be Italian and German) or even her real name. Gres was the name taken by her husband, Serge Czerefkow, a Russian painter she married in the 30's. She was born Germaine Krebs, then changed her name to Alix Barton. The Metropolitan Museum's catalogue told her life story simply: "Mme. Gres is a creation," it said.         Trained as a sculptor, she began designing clothes in 1930 after learning sketching and cutting at the house of Premet. She then worked for a house called, coincidentally, Alix. During World War II, she started her own house, called Gres, one of only 20 that stayed open throughout the war.         By the 1950's, Mme. Gres had fully developed what became her signature. She devoted herself early on to draping, and even her name began to evoke images of Grecian dress. Soon she was dressing the society women who became devoted to her, and wives of heads of state, including Princess Grace, Jacqueline Kennedy and Danielle Mitterrand.         "Mme. Gres is one of the most important 20th-century designers," Mr. Martin said of his decision to hold a retrospective of her work. "Along with Vionnet and Chanel, Mme. Gres was making the most advanced clothing in Paris in the 1930's."         It was not until 1980 that Mme. Gres showed a ready-to-wear line, 10 years after her peers had done so.         In an interview with Women's Wear Daily in 1975, she said: "From the beginning, I didn't want to do what others were doing in any way. I wasn't able to, because I didn't have the knowledge. That was one reason I took the material and worked directly on it. I used the knowledge I had, which was sculpture."       
         Mildred Orrick, a designer who gave women's fashion a natural, informal look for more than three decades, died on Dec. 9 at her home in Elliston, Va., where she had lived for the last 20 years. She was 88.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Sarah Orrick of Washington.         With the emergence of American designers as a dominant influence in the 1940's, Mrs. Orrick was one of the new generation of designers who were leading fashion toward sensible clothes at a time when the market was quickly growing.         Her earliest best-known designs, which were produced for Janice Milan Inc. in the late 1940's, represented her view of a look that was feminine but simple. But there had been a practicality and an originality to her work almost from the start.         As a costume designer in the early 40's, she put dancers' leotards in her sketches for Harper's Bazaar as a style that was suitable for wearing off the rehearsal floor. Quickly, they became part of the day's outfits.         By the 1950's, her designs were a regular part of New York fashion shows. At the same time, she was offering outfits that could be sewn at home.         In 1958, she continued her work under the label of Claire McCardell, a designer and friend of Mrs. Orrick who had died the year before. In 1963, she became a designer for Villager Clothes, a highly successful line that operated out of Philadelphia.         She retired in the mid-1970's.         Mrs. Orrick studied at the Parsons School of Design in New York and Paris. She started as a costume designer and worked for Natasha Rambova.         She also worked for Norman Bel Geddes, the stage and industrial designer, designing costumes for productions of "Lysistrata" and "Hamlet" in the 1920's and 1930's.         Her husband of 62 years, Jesse Lewis Orrick, died in 1992. She is also survived by a daughter, Martha Orrick of Colorado Springs, Colo.; a son, Nicholas, of Andover, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Moton Hubbard, who was deputy assistant secretary of state for public affairs from 1964 to 1970, making her the top-ranking black woman in the Johnson Administration at the time, died on Sunday at her home in Chevy Chase, Md. She was 82.         Ms. Hubbard, who retired in 1970 at the onset of Cushing's disease, an adrenal disorder, died of congestive heart failure, said Marc L. Alper of Rockview, Md., a family friend.         In her State Department post, she worked at developing programs intended to eliminate discrimination against black soldiers during the Vietnam War. She also oversaw the department's public services and news offices.         During World War II, she worked for the Federal Security Agency, helping to organize arrangements for war workers and was a race and human relations consultant. She joined the State Department in 1963 as a coordinator of women's activities.         The daughter of a pioneer in the civil rights movement, Dr. Robert Russa Moton, she grew up on the campus of Tuskegee Institute, where her father had succeeded its founder, Booker T. Washington, as president. She was educated at Boston University.         Her husband, Maceo W. Hubbard, a Justice Department official, died in 1991. She is survived by two sisters, Catherine Patterson of Exeter, N.H., and Jennie Moton Taylor of Indianapolis.       
         Frances Prince Schuman, the founding chairwoman of the National Friends of Public Broadcasting and the wife of the composer William Schuman, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         She died after a brief illness, said her son, Anthony.         Mrs. Schuman was the founder and first chairwoman of the Friends of Thirteen and the National Friends of Public Broadcasting, and served for many years on the board of WNET Channel 13. With the director John Houseman she guided the development of the Acting Company, a theater group of drama graduates that her husband established when he was the president of the Juilliard School.         Mrs. Schuman, known as Frankie, was born in New York City in 1913 and graduated from Barnard College. Her early career was in social services, with a focus on people with disabilities. She was a staff member of the New York State Employment Service and a director of the Vocational Advisory Service. She was a founding director of the Cerebral Palsy Association and the Urban League of Westchester County, and at the time of her death was on the boards of the MacDowell Colony and the American Composers Orchestra.         In addition to her son, of Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Andrea, of Newton Highlands, Mass., and a grandson, Joshua Weiss.       
         Jean Ickelheimer Stralem, a New York philanthropist and art collector, died on Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 86 and lived on the Upper East Side.         She suffered a long illness, said Lillian Groueff, her former sister-in-law.         Mrs. Stralem, who was born into the Lehman investment banking family, devoted much of her life to the blind and to children with multiple handicaps. One of her principal beneficiaries was the Lighthouse, with which she had a 56-year relationship.         She became a member in 1938, was elected to the board in 1948 and was made vice president in 1973. She also served as vice chairman and continued as an active board member until her death. In the 1950's, she was instrumental in finding community locations for Lighthouse nursery schools.         She began to press for a comprehensive child-development center as early as 1964, and with expansion and renovations at the Lighthouse in 1994, a Jean Stralem Child Development Center was dedicated on her birthday in October.         She often participated in fund-raising benefits, particulary for the American Theater Wing. She was a former board member and officer of the Theater Wing. Other beneficiaries of her philanthropy included Lenox Hill Hospital.         Her private collection included works by Picasso, Matisse, Degas and Renoir, as well as rare first-edition children's books and miniature furniture. Her grandfather, Philip Lehman, was the original owner of the Lehman Art Collection that is now part of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Her husband, Donald Stralem, a New York banker, died in 1976.         Mrs. Stralem is survived by a daughter, Lynn Stralem of Carmel, Calif.; two granddaughters and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 24, 1994, Saturday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Thursday about Jean Ickelheimer Stralem, a New York philanthropist and art collector, misstated her relationship with the American Theater Wing. Mrs. Stralem, who died on Tuesday, was a current and active officer and board member -- not a former one -- at her death.       
         Sylvia S. (Shethar) Everdell, a champion amateur sailor and equestrian, died on Monday in her home in Boston. She was 74.         The cause was heart failure, said her husband, Romeyn.         A native New Yorker who graduated from Sarah Lawrence College in 1943, Mrs. Everdell won the national women's sailing championships in 1939, 1940, 1947 and 1971. At age 17, she captured the Maclay Cup, the top horsemanship prize for junior riders.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Susan Clippinger and Rosalind Everdell, both of Jamaica Plain, Mass.; two sons, John of Jamaica Plain and Peter of Littleton, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
         Helen Payne Wilshire Walsh, who for decades worked on behalf of the disabled, died on Monday in Greenwich (Conn.) Hospital. A resident of Greenwich, she was 97.         Mrs. Walsh suffered a long illness, said her niece, Helen Payne Clarke, also of Greenwich.         To Fairfield County, Mrs. Walsh was a matriarch of Republican politics and a doyenne of society. But she was known internationally for her work with the disabled, traveling the world to speak, raise funds and visit hospitals and refugee camps.         She was a friend of former President George Bush, at one time a Greenwich resident, who appointed her to a three-year term on the National Council on Disability in 1990 when she was 92. The panel drafts legislation on behalf of the disabled.         "Of all the people who gave of themselves to the political process," Mr. Bush said from his office in Houston, "Helen Walsh ranks right up there with those I admired the most." She was, he said, a "revered friend and an inspiration to me in both my private and public life."         Over the years, Mrs. Walsh worked inside many institutions and organizations, including the Institute of Rehabilitative Medicine of New York University Medical Center. She served as president of Rehabilitation International USA and vice president of Rehabilitation International, a worldwide volunteer agency.         President Richard M. Nixon named her to his National Advisory Council of Vocational Rehabilitation in the early 1970's.         She received the 1972 Howard A. Rusk Award from the Institute for Rehabilitative Medicine.         She was vice chairman of the Republican Town Committee and a member of the party's State Central and Finance Committees.         Helen Payne was born in 1897 in Cincinnati. She came to Greenwich in 1932 with her first husband, Joseph Wilshire, a future chairman of Standard Brands. He died in 1951, and in 1968 she married William Walsh, a political consultant, who died in 1983.         Mrs. Walsh is survived by a stepson, William James Walsh, of Princeton, N.J., and two step-grandsons, Joseph W. Wilshire 4th of Goshen, Conn., and Van H. Wilshire of Greenwich.       
         Julie Haydon, the actress who created the role of the fragile Laura Wingfield in the original production of "The Glass Menagerie," died on Saturday in La Crosse, Wis. She was 84.         The cause was abdominal cancer, said Patricia Angelin, the executor of the estate of George Jean Nathan. Miss Haydon was the widow of Nathan, the drama critic.         When "The Glass Menagerie" opened on Broadway in 1945, it immediately established Tennessee Williams's reputation and represented an important return to the theater for Laurette Taylor, who played Amanda Wingfield, a fictional representation of the playwright's mother. Though overshadowed by Miss Taylor, Miss Haydon, as the young girl who cherished her collection of glass figurines, shared in the praise. In his review in The New York Times, Lewis Nichols wrote that she brought "a shy helplessness, a desire to be liked" to a role that was based on Williams's sister.         Miss Haydon was born in Oak Park, Ill. When she was 19, she toured with Minnie Maddern Fiske in "Mrs. Bumpstead Leigh." Two years later, she played Ophelia in a production of "Hamlet" at the Hollywood Playhouse. Among her films were "Age of Innocence" (with Irene Dunne), "The Scoundrel" (with Noel Coward) and "A Family Affair," the first in the Andy Hardy series. While appearing on the stage in California in "Autumn Crocus" (with Frances Lederer) she met Nathan.         She made her Broadway debut in 1935 in Philip Barry's "Bright Star," which closed after seven performances. Several subsequent plays were successes, including Paul Vincent Carroll's "Shadow and Substance," in which she played a saintly maid, and William Saroyan's Pulitzer Prize-winning "The Time of Your Life," in which she created the role of the prostitute Kitty Duval.         Also in the cast of "The Time of Your Life" were Gene Kelly and Eddie Dowling. Later she appeared in Saroyan's "Sweeney in the Trees" and "Hello, Out There," opposite Dowling. Reviewing "Hello, Out There," Brooks Atkinson wrote in The Times that together they gave "a lyrical performance of great enchantment."         Dowling was the director as well as a star of "The Glass Menagerie" (in the role based on the author). After that historic production, Miss Haydon acted in several other Broadway plays, including Ferenc Molnar's "Miracle in the Mountains." Her performance in "The Glass Menagerie" remained the high point of her career.         She married Nathan in 1955. After his death in 1958, she made guest appearances in various plays often in community theaters and on college campuses. She also lectured in programs drawn from her husband's many books. In 1962 she left New York and returned to the Midwest. For 10 years she was actress in residence at the College of St. Teresa in Winona, Minn.         She played the mother in revivals of "The Glass Menagerie," and in 1980, still petite with a cameo face, she returned to the New York theater to do the role off Broadway, opposite Ms. Angelin as the daughter.         She is survived by her sister, Miriam Donaldson Ziegler of Los Angeles.       
         Elizabeth Glaser, who waged a tireless campaign to draw attention to pediatric AIDS after she unknowingly passed the disease on to her daughter and son, died yesterday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 47.         The cause was complications from AIDS, said Josh Baran, a spokesman for the family.         Mrs. Glaser, the wife of Paul Michael Glaser, a director and actor who starred in the "Starsky and Hutch" television series, was one of several public figures to bring AIDS to the forefront of the 1992 Presidential campaign. She had contracted H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS, through a blood transfusion in 1981.         Thousands of delegates, dignitaries and guests stood frozen in place at the Democratic National Convention in New York City as she told of the death of her 7-year-old daughter, Ariel, in 1988 from AIDS.         "She taught me to love when all I wanted to do was hate," Mrs. Glaser said. "She taught me to help others when all I wanted to do was help myself."         In a statement yesterday, President Clinton and his wife, Hillary, said they were deeply saddened by her death. "Elizabeth confronted the challenge of AIDS in her own life and lost her beloved daughter to AIDS at a time when our Government and our country were too indifferent to this illness and the people who had it," he said.         Mrs. Glaser, a former teacher, was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus when she was nine months pregnant with Ariel, her first child. She began bleeding and was rushed to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, where she received seven pints of blood in a transfusion.         The baby was delivered successfully but four years later, became seriously ill. Hospital tests found her red blood count low, and she was later tested with the other members of the family for H.I.V.         Mrs. Glaser tested positive, and doctors found she had passed the virus to Ariel through her breast milk. She had also given the virus to her son, Jake, during pregnancy. Mr. Glaser remained uninfected.         Jake, now 10, has shown no signs that he has developed AIDS.         In 1988, drawing on connections made through her husband, Mrs. Glaser helped to found the Pediatric AIDS Foundation with two friends, Susan DeLaurentis and Susan Zeegen.         The foundation, working out of a donated room with 14 desks and 12 employees, has raised more than $30 million for pediatric education and research, much of it for the Ariel Project, which is searching for ways to block transmission of AIDS from a mother to her fetus.         The foundation is also studying why some children infected with H.I.V. live longer than others.         After she and her husband first described the family's fight with the virus in a magazine story in 1989, Mrs. Glaser became a public crusader for more Government involvement in AIDS research and prevention. She appeared on "60 Minutes" and on the cover of People magazine. She also testified before Congress.         In 1991, she wrote an autobiography, "In The Absence of Angels" (G. P. Putnam's Sons), with Laura Palmer, describing her frustration with the dearth of information on children suffering from AIDS. The book, which was called "a handbook on how the connected make waves in America" in a review in The New York Times, also detailed how she was able to mobilize legislators like Senators Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, and Howard M. Metzenbaum, Democrat of Ohio, who sponsored a benefit in Washington for Mrs. Glaser's fledgling foundation.         While she used her celebrity status to further her work, she also promoted her cause through sheer force of will. She was chosen to speak at the 1992 convention only after confronting Mr. Clinton's campaign chairman, Mickey Kantor, now the United States Trade Representative, at a Los Angeles picnic, and telling him, "I have words inside me that I have to share."         Elizabeth Glaser was born in New York City and raised in Hewlett Harbor, L.I. She was educated at the University of Wisconsin and at Boston University and worked as a teacher and as a director at the Los Angeles Children's Museum.         She is survived by her husband and son; by her parents, Edith and Max Meyer of Sarasota, Fla., and by a brother, Peter, of Worcester, Mass.

         Mabel Julianelli, an innovator in couture shoe design, died on Friday at Southampton Hospital on Long Island. She was 85 and lived with her daughter, Jane, in Wainscott, L.I.         The cause of death was complications from an infection, Jane Julianelli said.         Mrs. Julianelli, whose career spanned 40 years, won the Coty American Fashion Critics Award in 1950 with her husband and partner, Charles Julianelli, for artistry and craftsmanship in shoe styles. Their company, Julianelli Shoes, became known in the 1960's for developing "the naked look," a light, airy style in footwear.         In an article in The New York Times in 1964, Angela Taylor, a fashion writer, wrote that Mrs. Julianelli "ignored the rule that bare shoes come out only in spring and summer," designing several sandals for the fall, including "one that is virtually nothing but toe."         She also broke the rule that said tailored shoes go with textured stockings, preferring a lightweight pump with a whimsical low round heel.         Mrs. Julianelli, who was born in Brooklyn, is survived by her daughter, Jane.       
         Janet Oppenheim, a historian on aspects of 19th-century British life like psychological depression, the condition of women and sex roles and stereotypes, died on Friday at Bryn Mawr Hospital in Bryn Mawr, Pa. She was 46 and lived in Villanova, Pa.         The cause was cancer, said her mother, Elaine Oppenheim.         At her death, Dr. Oppenheim was a professor of history at American University in Washington, where she had taught since 1975.         Her latest book is "Shattered Nerves: Doctors, Patients and Depression in Victorian England" (Oxford, 1991). Praising the work in The New Republic, the author Alfred Kazin wrote, "The scholarship is remarkably full, meticulous and far-reaching." And the Stanford University historian Peter Stansky called it "a fascinating study" that "tells us much about the age itself, its preoccupations and obsessions."         In a 1987 interview, Professor Oppenheim said some feminist historians had suggested that Victorian women had been especially prone to mental and emotional illness because of the confining nature of their lives. But, she said, "for every woman who collapsed in such an illness, there were scores, maybe even hundreds, who soldiered on against the same restrictions and the same limitations on their lives."         Among Professor Oppenheim's other books was "The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914" (Cambridge, 1985), which the journal Victorian Studies called "a major contribution to the history of ideas."         Courses that Professor Oppenheim taught at American University included "Men and Women in Victorian Culture: Gender Roles and Stereotypes" and "Selected Topics on the Condition of Women in Victorian England." She was a visiting professor at Princeton University in 1979 and Bryn Mawr College in 1986, and a Guggenheim Fellow in 1988.         Professor Oppenheim was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Brearley School there and, in 1970, from Bryn Mawr College, where she was summa cum laude. She received a Ph.D. in history from Columbia University in 1975.         In addition to her mother, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, John Salmon, a retired Bryn Mawr history professor; a daughter by a previous marriage, Ashley Minihan of Villanova, and a sister, Barbara Berresford of Manhattan.
