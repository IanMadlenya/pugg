        India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         India Edwards, former vice chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, who worked to advance the role of women in politics, died Sunday at Fircrest Convalescent Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif. She was 94 years old and lived in Greenbrea, Calif.         Mrs. Edwards was unanimously elected to the national committee in 1950. She was first associated with the committee as a volunteer in the 1944 Presidential campaign. From 1945 to 1947 she was executive secretary of the women's division, which she served as associate director before becoming the committee's vice chairwoman.         Mrs. Edwards remained active in the Democratic Party for more than 30 years, through several generations of Democratic politicians, including Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson.         For 22 years before she became active in politics she was on the staff of The Chicago Tribune, where she was society editor and woman's editor. She left the paper to marry her third husband, Herbert T. Edwards, a State Department official, and moved to Washington in 1942. Mr. Edwards died in the late 1970's.         Campaigning With Truman         Mrs. Edwards accompanied Mr. Truman, her political hero, on his 1948 campaign tour, where she repeatedly expressed her confidence in his victory at the polls.         At one point the President turned to her and sighed. ''India,'' he said, ''sometimes I think there are only two people who believe I will win. You and me.'' ''That's enough,'' she replied. Largely because of Mrs. Edwards's influence, Mr. Truman appointed more women to top jobs than any preceding President. Among them were Eugenia Anderson as Ambassador to Denmark, Perle Mesta as Minister to Luxembourg, Ruth Bryan Rohde as an alternate delegate to the United Nations and Georgia Neese Clark as Treasurer of the United States.         Explaining how she worked to increase the number of women in Federal jobs, Mrs. Edwards recalled: ''Sometimes I felt like a ghoul. I'd read the obits, and as soon as a man had died, I'd rush over to the White House and suggest a woman to replace him.''         Mrs. Edwards, who was named for her mother and her grandmother, was born in Chicago and grew up in Nashville. Her memoirs, ''Pulling No Punches,'' were published by G. P. Putnam's in 1977.         Mrs. Edward's daughter, India Moffett Williams, died in 1979, and her son, John Holbrook Moffett, died in World War II. She is survived by five grandchildren.

Edna Ramsaier Yardley, the widow and collaborator of Herbert O. Yardley, a pioneer code breaker, died of a stroke on Tuesday at her home. She was 87 years old.         She was Mr. Yardley's assistant in the American Black Chamber operation that he established in 1919 in New York City. In 1921 that group broke the Japanese diplomatic code, enabling the United States to know Japanese negotiating positions in the 1922 naval disarmament conference in Washington.         She remained in New York after the chamber was abolished by Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson in 1929 with the oft-quoted aphorism, ''Gentlemen do not read each other's mail.''         In 1940, she joined the Army's Signal Intelligence Service, the organization that again broke Japanese diplomatic codes.         In 1941 she left the Army to rejoin Mr. Yardley in establishing a Canadian coding service. The two were married in 1944.         A first marriage had ended in divorce. Mr. Yardley, considered the father of American crytography, died in 1958. Mrs. Yardley is survived by a sister, Lillian R. Meyer of Whiting, N.J.

        Betti S. Whaley, president of the Washington Urban League and a former commissioner of the New York City Agency for Child Development, died of the effects of diabetes and septicemia on Sunday at Howard University Hospital in Washington. She was 60 years old and lived in Washington.         Betti S. Whaley, president of the Washington Urban League and a former commissioner of the New York City Agency for Child Development, died of the effects of diabetes and septicemia on Sunday at Howard University Hospital in Washington. She was 60 years old and lived in Washington.         Mrs. Whaley, also a former deputy assistant secretary of the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development, had been head of the Washington Urban League since 1983.         From 1974 to 1976 she was commissioner of the Agency for Child Development. Her tenure was stormy, marked by accusations of fiscal mismanagement that led to her resignation.         Mrs. Whaley was born in Baltimore and received bachelor's and master's degrees in social work from Ohio State University.         Long Association With League         In 1953 she became associate executive director of the Columbus (Ohio) Urban League, beginning an association that spanned 37 years.         After serving as director of community development programs at the New York headquarters of the nonpartisan civil-rights organization, Mrs. Whaley was appointed to the Agency for Child Development post.         She moved to Washington in the late 1970's and was a Congressional aide before taking the H.U.D. post. Afterward she returned to the Urban League as the first woman to head its Washington branch.         In Washington she was active in many civic groups, including the District of Columbia Committee on Public Education, the district's Apprenticeship Council, its Baseball Commission and its Commission on Budget and Financial Priorities.         She is survived by her husband, A. Jackson Whaley.       
        Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         She had been suffering from cancer, said her son, Timothy.         Known as Lois Moran throughout her career, she made her first film, in France, at the age of 14 and gained fame the next year when she starred with Ronald Colman in Samuel Goldwyn's ''Stella Dallas.''         In her film career of more than two dozen movies, Miss Moran combined an artist's versatility with romantic appeal. F. Scott Fitzgerald was said to have based the character Rosemary on her when he wrote ''Tender Is the Night.''         By the age of 20, she had already made four movies for Fox Studios, where she was under long-term contract. But she played leading roles for other studios as well, among them parts in ''Padlocked,'' ''Reckless Lady,'' ''The Road to Mandalay,'' ''Don't Marry,'' ''Mammy'' and ''The Men in Her Life.''         In the early 1930's, after studying singing, she moved to musicals, making her Broadway debut in ''This Is New York.'' She was the leading woman in George Kaufman's satire ''Of Thee I Sing'' and also starred for four years in ''Let 'Em Eat Cake.''         But in 1935, after marrying Col. Clarence M. Young, an Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Miss Moran slowed the pace of her career. She retired permanently in 1954 after co-starring with Robert Preston in the television series ''Waterfront.''         Miss Moran was born in Pittsburgh but, while still an infant, moved to Paris with her mother, a physician's widow. There she joined the Paris Opera Corps de Ballet, where she was spotted by a director who cast her in a movie.         She returned to the United States and starred as Belle Bennett's daughter in ''Stella Dallas.'' After that film's success, the offers poured in. She did one or two films at each of the major studios before signing her long-term contract with Fox.         For some time after her retirement, she and her husband lived and traveled throughout the country. But when Mr. Young retired as a vice president of Pan American World Airways more than 20 years ago, the couple moved permanently to Sedona.         Miss Moran's only immediate survivor is her son, who lives in Sedona.       
        Tamara Deutscher, a writer and editor who with her husband, the late Isaac Deutscher, researched the leaders of Soviet Communism, died on Tuesday in London, where she lived. She was 77 years old and, according to family friends, had suffered from emphysema.         Tamara Deutscher, a writer and editor who with her husband, the late Isaac Deutscher, researched the leaders of Soviet Communism, died on Tuesday in London, where she lived. She was 77 years old and, according to family friends, had suffered from emphysema.         Mrs. Deutscher, born in Poland, escaped to England at the outbreak of World War II. As Tamara Lebenhaft, she was secretary to an expatriate organization of Polish journalists in London when she and Mr. Deutscher were married in 1947. She collaborated with him on his biographies of Stalin and Trotsky and, after his death in 1967, she edited collections of her husband's writings.         Mrs. Deutscher wrote a study of her own, ''The Other Lenin,'' published in 1973, and later assisted the historian E. H. Carr in preparing the last volumes of his history of the Soviet Union.         She is survived by a son, Martin, of London.       
        Blossom Heller, a justice of the New York State Supreme Court, died on Friday at her home in Brooklyn.         Justice Heller was elected to the State Supreme Court in the 2nd Judicial Department, which covers Brooklyn and Staten Island, in 1982. Before that, she served as a judge in the Family Court and in the Criminal Courts of New York City.         A graduate of Brooklyn Law School, she was in private practice from 1957 to 1961, when she was appointed as an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, a position she held until 1974. She served for two years as a law secretary before being appointed by Mayor Abraham D. Beame to the Family Court in 1976.         She is survived by a brother, Jay, of Brooklyn.       
        Susan W. Shapiro, a lawyer and former law secretary to an appellate judge of the New Jersey Superior Court, died on Friday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.         Susan W. Shapiro, a lawyer and former law secretary to an appellate judge of the New Jersey Superior Court, died on Friday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 47 years old and lived in Woodcliff Lake, N.J.         She died of breast cancer, a family spokesman said.         Ms. Shapiro had practiced business law with her husband, Robert, in Hackensack, N.J., since 1983. Before that she was law secretary to Judge Sylvia B. Pressler of the Appellate Division of the New Jersey Superior Court. She had also taught English and journalism at Ridgewood High School.         She graduated cum laude from Smith College, where she was a member of Phi Beta Kappa, in 1965. Ms. Shapiro earned her law degree from Rutgers University, and a master's degree in education from New York University.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, Adam and Matthew; a daughter, Amy; her parents, Stanley and Edith Weinstein of Bridgeport, Conn., and a brother, Peter Weinstein of Trumbull, Conn.       
        Clara Beyer, an influential New Deal administrator who served as a confidential aide to Frances Perkins during her 12 years as Secretary of Labor, died Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 98 years old.         Clara Beyer, an influential New Deal administrator who served as a confidential aide to Frances Perkins during her 12 years as Secretary of Labor, died Tuesday at her home in Washington. She was 98 years old.         A family spokesman said she died of a heart ailment.         A forceful, dynamic woman, Mrs. Beyer became a close friend of Secretary Perkins and Eleanor Roosevelt. She is credited by Esther Peterson, a former Presidential adviser on consumer affairs, with bringing diverse state labor laws under a common Federal umbrella.         Mrs. Beyer began her career as secretary of the Minimum Wage Board for the District of Columbia after World War I. Her job was to assess the wages paid to women in the district so minimum levels could be set.         In 1928 she went to work for the Children's Bureau of the Labor Department. After Franklin D. Roosevelt's election as President, she played a valuable back-room role in the appointment of Secretary Perkins, the first woman ever named to a Cabinet, and in the development of much of the social legislation that marked the New Deal: establishing worker safety, maximum hours, minimum wages and Social Security.         Mrs. Beyer is survived by three sons, Donald of Falls Church, Va., Morton of Lolo, Mont., and Richard of Seattle; 12 grandchildren, and 23 great-grandchildren.       
        Helen D. Johnson, the retired president of the Charles E. Culpeper Foundation, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan.

Culpeper Foundation, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 70 years old and had homes in Manhattan and Spring Lake, N.J.         She died of complications of cancer, a funeral home representative said.         She was president of the foundation, located in Manhattan for many years but now in Stamford, Conn., from 1968 until illness forced her to retire in May. She was named to the foundation's board in 1965. She was a graduate of St. Mary's Academy in Newburgh, N.Y., and had been an executive secretary for many years before joining the foundation.         She is survived by two nephews.       
         Eve Arden, the caustic comedienne featured in dozens of films as a heroine's wry and wisecracking best friend, a warmhearted but sassy schoolteacher or secretary, died yesterday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif.         The actress said she was born on April 30, 1912, but Ron Lisell, a spokesman for the family, said she was 83. Her death was caused by heart disease, Mr. Lisell said.         Miss Arden made her Broadway debut in the "Ziegfeld Follies" of 1934, but although she often appeared in plays in New York and on the road, she was chiefly a Hollywood actress. She was best known as the sardonic but likable English teacher in the radio and television series "Our Miss Brooks," which ran from 1948 until 1957. The series earned her an Emmy award as best actress for 1953.         The tall and languid Miss Brooks, noted for her exquisite comic timing and a knack for making the most of a throwaway line, received featured billing in more than 100 movies, including "Stage Door," "The Marx Brothers at the Circus," "No, No, Nanette," "Bedtime Story," "Cover Girl," "Anatomy of a Murder" and "The Dark at the Top of the Stairs." In 1945 she received an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress for her performance in "Mildred Pierce."         The actress, whose original name was Eunice Quedens, was born in Mill Valley, Calif., near San Francisco. She was reared by her divorced mother and an aunt. Both encouraged her to act in school plays. At 16, she said, "I was dumped by my mother and aunt at the Henry Duffy office in San Francisco and told to get a job acting, which I did."         She joined the Duffy stock company, which performed in San Francisco and Los Angeles, and she later switched to the Bandbox Repertory Theater, which toured the "citrus circuit" in Southern California.         Miss Arden was a seasoned 21-year-old actress when she got a job in "Low and Behold," a forerunner of the "New Faces" revues produced by Leonard Sillman. The producer Lee Shubert saw a performance at the Pasadena Playhouse and offered Miss Arden a part as a showgirl in the 1934 "Ziegfeld Follies" on Broadway. And he told her to shed her real name.         Eunice Quedens did so by studying the labels of cosmetic jars on her dressing table and, she said, "stole my first name from Evening in Paris and the second from Elizabeth Arden."         Eve Arden won her first theatrical accolade in 1935 when she was featured with Jimmy Savo in "Parade."The New York Times drama critic Brooks Atkinson wrote: "Count on the credit side Eve Arden's lorgnette humor which turns a song entitled 'Send for the Militia' into highly amusing satire." That and other reviews helped to win Miss Arden a featured role in the 1936 "Ziegfeld Follies." As Fannie Brice's understudy, she starred in several performances. Success, With the Help of a Cat         Miss Arden made her film debut in a 1937 grade-B melodrama called "Oh, Doctor," in which she disastrously played a gun moll. But her big break came that same year when the director Gregory La Cava cast her in what was to have been a small role in "Stage Door," starring Katharine Hepburn and Ginger Rogers.         The actress built up her supposedly minor role with the aid of a slothful cat named Henry, which hung around the set. Having noticed that the sluggish Henry hardly ever moved, Miss Arden called Mr. La Cava's attention to the fact that the cat liked to sleep draped over her shoulders. The director was amused, and he included many shots of Miss Arden wearing the live cat as a fur piece. She was long remembered as the "girl with the cat."         In three years Miss Arden appeared in more than 20 films, becoming typecast in roles characterized by brittle, caustic humor. Trying to get away from that stereotype, she returned to Broadway and won praise for her featured roles in the Kern-Hammerstein musical "Very Warm for May" in 1939, the revue "Two for the Show" in 1940 and Cole Porter's "Let's Face It" in 1941, in which she appeared with Danny Kaye.         Miss Arden nearly stole the 1944 war movie "The Doughgirls" from three stars by enlivening her role as a tough-talking Russian guerrilla, punctuating her flines in ractured English lines with funny and risque gestures with her sniper's rifle.         Other featured roles followed, most of them putting Miss Arden back in what she considered the rut of the coldly tart-tongued and vitriolic cynic. It mattered not, she said, that audiences always responded to her with laughter; she did not like seeing herself in those roles, which were carried over into radio shows in which she starred with Jack Haley and Jack Carson.         "I just don't like that dame," she said in 1952. "She is hard-boiled, unsentimental and not me."         With "Our Miss Brooks," Miss Arden was able to alter her image, keeping the snappy, sardonic lines but giving the schoolteacher character a warmly affectionate and self-deprecating side.         That television series went off the air in 1957, and Miss Arden appeared in only an occasional film until 1967, when she began a two-season run co- starring with the comedienne Kaye Ballard in the NBC television show "The Mothers-in-Law." She also appeared as a school principal in the films "Grease" in 1978 and "Grease II" in 1982, and in "Under the Rainbow" in 1981.         Miss Arden's second husband, Brooks West, an actor, died in 1984.         Survivors include two daughters, Liza and Constance, and two sons, Douglas and Duncan.         Correction:  November 17, 1990, Tuesday, Late Edition - Final         An obituary on Tuesday about the actress Eve Arden misstated the date of her film debut. It was in 1929, when she appeared under her original name, Eunice Quedens, in "The Song of Love"; it was not in 1937.       
         Mary Kenny Landers, professor emeritus of mathematics at Hunter College, died on Sunday at Rhode Island Hospital in Providence. She was 85 years old and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         She died of cancer of the colon, said her son-in-law, John Savage.         Professor Landers taught at Hunter for almost 50 years, retiring in 1975. She was a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science and the New York Academy of Sciences.         An early advocate of academic collective bargaining, she was secretary of the Legislative Conference, an organization representing the professional staff at the City University of New York, from 1959 to 1972. At that time, the conference merged with theUnited Federation of College Teachers to form the Professional Staff Congress.         Professor Landers was born in Fall River, Mass., and graduated from Brown University in 1926. She received an M.A. from Brown and a Ph.D. from the University of Chicago.         A widow, she is survived by two sons, Robert J., of Arlington, Va., and Richard B., of Loudonville, N.Y.; a daughter, Patricia L. Savage of Providence; two sisters, Margaret Rowell of Queens and Rita Hitchinson of Hyde Park, Mass., and seven grandchildren.       
         Mary Martin, America's favorite leading lady of musical comedy, as Ens. Nellie Forbush in "South Pacific," Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music" or the title role in "Peter Pan," died Saturday afternoon at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 76 years old.         She died of cancer, said Richard Grant, who handles publicity for the actress's son, Larry Hagman. Miss Martin, who had been hospitalized recently at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, returned home last Tuesday.         More than any of her peers, she was what she played and she incarnated the songs that she sang. Miss Martin was "a cockeyed optimist" and she was also the eternal child imagined by James M. Barrie. Approaching 70, she was still saying, "I can't help thinking I'm 19." On stage, at least figuratively, she never stopped flying. Echoes of Poetry         In reviewing her performance in "South Pacific," Kenneth Tynan said that she reminded him of something Aldous Huxley wrote about the minor Caroline poets: "They spoke in their natural voices and it was poetry." While Ethel Merman was an entire brass section and Carol Channing was a parade, Miss Martin remained natural and exactingly true to life -- and it was poetry.         Her voice was never the strongest instrument. She was not beautiful (though she could be radiant). Through determination, pluck, charm, self-mocking humor and a profound sense of self, everything converged to create an exhilarating theater artist.         For 50 years Miss Martin projected the vitality of someone who loved her work and knew precisely how to make other people share in her happiness. As Elia Kazan, who directed her in her first Broadway starring role in "One Touch of Venus," said in his autobiography, she was "full of the love of being loved." Specialized in Long Runs         Although she made a number of films, she was devoted to the theater. She starred in relatively few Broadway shows, but the work was valuable; one could regard the actress herself as being the heyday of the Broadway musical.         She specialized in long runs and was known for not missing performances. In his autobiography, Richard Rodgers called her "an extraordinary trouper," adding, "In all the years I've known her, I have never seen her give a performance that was anything less than the best that was in her." She did have, he said, one unusual trait: "She cannot utter even the mildest form of profanity." The "strongest expression" he ever heard her use was "He's a son-of-a-bear."         If there had been a darker side to Miss Martin, she certainly kept it hidden from her public, which never failed to think of her as joyful. In her private life, she endured tragedies (including her husband's death) and on stage was prone to suffer accidents, but she never let anything interfere with the sheer delight of her performance.  A Thousand Shampoos         Repeatedly she set herself challenges, many of them physical. It was at her suggestion that Nellie Forbush literally washed that man "right out-a my hair," which meant that she shampooed her hair on stage for 1,000 performances. Originally she had planned to sing another song in "South Pacific" while cartwheeling across the stage -- until she cartwheeled right into the orchestra pit. It was also her idea to sing a song standing on her head in "Jennie," one of her less successful musicals. In rehearsal at the age of 63 in the Aleksei Arbuzov play "Do You Turn Somersaults?," she turned somersaults on stage until she fell from a revolving platform and was grounded by her doctors.         In her autobiography, "My Heart Belongs," she declared that of all her characters Peter Pan was indisputably her favorite, for a very simple reason: "Everyone else loves Peter so." She added, "Neverland is the way I would like real life to be: timeless, free, mischievous, filled with gaiety, tenderness and magic."         The key to her first Broadway success, in 1938 in the Cole Porter musical, "Leave It to Me," was her innate ability to combine innocence and insouciance. In that show she sang "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," a vintage Porter song in which almost every word has a double meaning. She played against the lines, which made them even funnier, and she did a striptease as if she was hanging up the laundry. It was often said about that song that Miss Martin did not know what she was singing until Sophie Tucker, who was also in the cast, explained the worldly, witty lyrics to her. The actress was never to lose that inbred sense of ingenuousness.  An Early Flight, A Crash Landing         From the first, Mary Virginia Martin was self-propelled. She was born in Weatherford, Tex., on Dec. 1, 1913 (although some reports placed the date one year later), the younger daughter of Preston Martin, a lawyer, and Juanita Presley Martin, a violin teacher. As one of a trio of little girls dressed as bellhops, she sang on a bandstand outside her father's courtroom. When she was 5, she sang "When Apples Grow on the Lilac Trees" at a fireman's ball. Once she tried to fly -- from the roof of a garage, without the mechanical assistance she would have later as Peter Pan -- and broke her collarbone.         Frequently she sang in churches and at clubs, and learned about show business by watching movies and imitating singers and dancers. As a young woman, she appeared with her best friend, Bessie Mae Sue Ella Yaeger, in amateur theatricals and later wondered why she had become a star and Bessie Mae had not. She decided it was because "I react to an audience.         "Give me 4 people and I'm         on         . Give me 400 and I'm a hundred times more on."         As a tribute to Bessie Mae -- and for good luck -- she worked her friend's name into many of her scripts, on stage and in films.         In her book Miss Martin recalled that Weatherford was famous for its watermelons. Long after she became a star, a sign was erected on the courthouse lawn: "Weatherford, Texas, home of watermelons and Mary Martin." Her observation: "I never got top billing in my hometown."         Nevertheless she had, she was convinced, a very happy childhood. Her parents sent her to Ward Belmont, a finishing school in Nashville. At 16, she married Benjamin Hagman, a Weatherford accountant and later a lawyer. They had one child, Larry Martin Hagman, who -- as the world knows -- became famous as J. R. on television's "Dallas."  Dancing Her Way To Hollywood         The actress's first marriage lasted only a few years, and the teen-age bride brought up her son as if he were her younger brother. Miss Martin was soon caught up in her career. At 18, she opened the Mary Hagman School of Dance in Weatherford, then went to Hollywood to study dancing and to search for a way to enter the movies. For several years she went back and forth between the two states and between teaching and performing.         The dancing school flourished (until it was destroyed by fire) while her performing career took several divergent paths. In Texas she sang on radio; in California she sang and danced in nightclubs. One evening she performed in a Sunday night talent show at the Trocadero nightclub in Los Angeles. Singing "The Weekend of a Private Secretary" and an operatic number entitled "Il Bacio" in her own syncopated version, she created a sensation. To her astonishment, people stood on chairs and tables and shouted bravo. Jack Benny, who was in the audience, later told her that it was one of the most exciting moments he could remember. "In 10 minutes," she said, "my life had changed."         Another member of the audience was Lawrence Schwab, a producer who took charge of her career. In answer to the frequent question, what causes a big break, she said: "Work. Work and work and work; be ready when the break comes." As she wrote in her autobiography, "All my life I have felt guilty if I didn't use any talent I have as fully as I could."         Under Mr. Schwab's aegis, she came to New York and auditioned to fill a suddenly vacant supporting role in the forthcoming Broadway musical "Leave It to Me." The unknown actress strode into a suite in the Ritz Towers and announced that she was going to sing four songs, adding, "If I can't sing all four, I'd rather not sing." As she recalled in her book, "A man reclining on a couch said, very mildly, 'Carry on, on all fours.' " She later discovered that the philosophical man on the couch was Cole Porter, the composer of the show. Bella Spewack, co-author of the book with her husband, Sam Spewack, asked Miss Martin if she had ever been on the New York stage. She admitted that she had not, and when Mrs. Spewack asked her why she thought she could do it, she answered boldly, "Try me."         In the audition, she was called upon to read her character's dialogue. She shouted the first line, "I'd like to renew my subscription" (meaning she would like to continue having a love affair). Her straightforward, self-confident delivery brought down the house. Should she get the part, Mr. Spewack told her, she should never change the reading of the line. Throughout her career her art was founded on such intuition.  A First Casting Much Against Type         She so captivated Porter and his collaborators that she was signed, despite the fact -- or rather because of the fact -- that she was cast against type: the innocent country girl playing a kept woman, and singing a striptease showstopper, "My Heart Belongs to Daddy." Fifty years later, in 1988, as a great-grandmother, she was still singing "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," at a celebration honoring Cole Porter. In May 1990 she was scheduled to sing the song again at the 75th anniversary celebration of the Shubert Theater in New Haven, but canceled her appearance because of illness.         Her overnight success on Broadway on Nov. 9, 1938 put her on the cover of Life magazine and drew the attention of Hollywood. Under contract to Paramount, she appeared in a series of forgettable roles in forgettable films, including "The Great Victor Herbert," "Rhythm on the River," "Love Thy Neighbor," "New York Town," "Birth of the Blues," "Kiss the Boys Goodbye," "Happy Go Lucky" and "True to Life."         There was one positive result of her Hollywood experience. She met and married Richard Halliday, a story editor at Paramount. He also became her producer and closest professional adviser and the father of their daughter, Heller Halliday. If she had remained in Hollywood, she might have disappeared into the studio system, but wisdom prevailed and she returned to New York, where she became a Broadway star and remained one for the next four decades.         Her first starring role was in "One Touch of Venus," written by Kurt Weill, Ogden Nash and S. J. Perelman. To combat his wife's hesitancy about playing the title goddess, a role originally conceived for Marlene Dietrich, Mr. Halliday took her to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and showed her the many interpretations of Venus in painting and sculpture. As the "Venus of Ozone Heights," who comes to life and steps down from her pedestal, she had her customary winsomeness, singing her signature song, "That's Him," simply sitting in a chair facing the audience.  The Bumpy Road To 'South Pacific'         After "One Touch of Venus," she starred in the musical "Lute Song" and in London in Noel Coward's "Pacific 1860" and toured for a year in Irving Berlin's "Annie Get Your Gun." Though Ethel Merman had played the title character, Annie Oakley, in the original production, the role -- along with the song, "Doin' What Comes Naturally" -- seemed made to measure for Miss Martin. As always, she was undeterred by the fact that she was succeeding another star (which she also did later when she took Carol Channing's "Hello, Dolly!" on tour of military bases in Vietnam).         In 1948, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d offered her the central role in "South Pacific." She was hesitant for two reasons. Disliking hospitals, she was not anxious to play the role of a nurse, and she felt insecure because her leading man would be an opera star, Ezio Pinza. When it was decided that the two would not be asked to sing a duet, she accepted the offer. Nellie Forbush, singing "Cockeyed Optimist," "Honey Bun," "I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Out-a My Hair" and, especially, "I'm in Love With a Wonderful Guy," became one of her greatest successes.         "South Pacific" was followed in 1954 by "Peter Pan" (her daughter was also in the cast) which she performed on Broadway and on television, live and then on tape, complete with her celebrated aerial ballet. The Broadway production ran for only 152 performances. It was largely through the taped television version (which was recently released on videocassette) that she became so identified with the role.         "Peter Pan" was an exact meeting of actress and character. As Miss Martin said, "I cannot even remember a day when I didn't want to be Peter." For years she had dreams of flying, all of which stopped just before the first television presentation of the show. Trying to explain the end of those dreams, she said, "Perhaps it was because I had experienced at last the joy of really flying." She could become almost mystical whenever she spoke about the experience, as in her statement: "I discovered I was happier in the air than on the ground. I probably always will be."  Another Character, Another Classic         In 1959, Rodgers and Hammerstein went to her again to ask her to play Maria von Trapp in "The Sound of Music." Though her own background could not have been more dissimilar from that of her real-life model, she -- and the audience -- felt the kinship. As she said, "We both have the same drive, utter determination." During her two years in the role, she missed only one performance.         Of her three Broadway triumphs only "Peter Pan" was to be recorded for posterity -- in the television version.In the case of both "South Pacific" and "The Sound of Music," other actresses played her role on screen (Mitzi Gaynor was Nellie and Julie Andrews was Maria von Trapp.) This meant that, except for her television appearances, especially one dynamic evening teamed with Ethel Merman, her most noteworthy performances existed only on the stage and on records.         As one sign of her own fallibility she often pointed to the fact that while accepting "South Pacific," "Peter Pan" and "The Sound of Music," she turned down the chance to be in "Oklahoma!", "Kiss Me Kate" and "My Fair Lady."         Among her other Broadway shows were the two-character musical "I Do I Do" and "Jennie." Occasionally she acted in dramas -- in a revival of "The Skin of Our Teeth," which she and Helen Hayes took on tour, and in "Do You Turn Somersaults?"         She and her husband owned a ranch in Brazil, Nossa Fazenda (Our Farm), next to a home owned by her friend Janet Gaynor. The Hallidays used the ranch as a vacation retreat. After her husband died in 1973, Miss Martin worked less but never fully retired. In 1981 she was a host on "Over Easy," a public television series about aging. In 1982 she was in a taxicab accident in San Francisco that took the life of her close friend Ben Washer and severely injured Miss Martin, Miss Gaynor and Miss Gaynor's husband, Paul Gregory. In 1986, fully recovered, she returned to the theater in a dramatic role, co-starring with Carol Channing in James Kirkwood's "Legends." Each portrayed an aging actress. "Legends" toured but never came to New York.         In 1989, Miss Martin returned to New York for a tribute to the television work of Richard Rodgers and to see "Jerome Robbins's Broadway," which reprised "I'm Flying" from "Peter Pan." Several months later, the 1960 television version of "Peter Pan" was shown again, with great success. Later, an illness precipitated her withdrawal from "Grovers Corners," Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt's musical version of "Our Town," in which she was scheduled to play the Stage Manager. In 1989 she received a Kennedy Center Award, given annually at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. Famous First Line One More Time         Some years ago she participated in a birthday tribute to Richard Rodgers at the Imperial Theater, where, decades before, she had made her Broadway debut in "Leave It to Me." For days, she worried about what she would say. When the time came, in characteristic fashion, she improvised. She walked on stage and said as loudly as she could, "I would like to renew my subscription." When she wrote about this moment in her autobiography, she commented, "That's what I would like to say, now and forever, to all audiences everywhere." Mary Martin's lifetime renewal was gratefully accepted.         Miss Martin is survived by her son, her daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, six grandchildren and one great-granddaughter. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held in New York at a later date.       
         Thelma Stevens, a social worker and retired head of the Women's Division of the United Methodist Church, died yesterday at Brooks Howell, a retirement home in Asheville, N.C. She was 88 years old.         She died of complications of a stroke, a spokeswoman for the church said.         As executive secretary of the church's Women's Division, Ms. Stevens was head of social relations work for Methodist women from 1940 to 1968. She was known in religious circles for her work for social justice, international peace and women's rights.         She was a graduate of Scarritt College and headed the Bethlehem Center, a community center for blacks in Augusta, Ga., from 1928 to 1939. In 1951, she was instrumental in having the Women's Division press for the publication of "States' Laws on Race and Color," a compilation of racial laws.         There are no immediate survivors.
