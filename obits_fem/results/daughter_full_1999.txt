         Mary Ann Unger, a sculptor and curator, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 53.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Born in New York in 1945, Ms. Unger began making sculpture as a child in art classes at the Museum of Modern Art. In 1967, she received a bachelor's degree in art at Mount Holyoke College, where she learned to weld, cast bronze and carve marble. After a year of graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley, she spent several years traveling, including a trip alone through North Africa. She then received a master of fine arts degree in 1975 from Columbia University, where she studied with Ronald Bladen and George Sugarman. The playful, undulating shapes of the pieces she started exhibiting in the late 1970's reflected Mr. Sugarman's influence.         These evolved into tensile structures whose repeating arcs evoked both Islamic architecture and boughs of trees. The style served Ms. Unger well in numerous public commissions, mostly recently in 1991 with ''Ode to Tatlin,'' a pair of tall, crisp colonnadelike curving forms that face each other, forming a kind of elliptical gateway, at the Aaron Copland School of Music at Queens College.         After Ms. Unger's breast cancer was diagnosed in 1985, she exhibited a more expressionistic side in her art. Over the next several years she became known for dark, bulbous, beamlike forms that she often laid out or propped up in clusters. Made of hydrocal, a lightweight plaster, over steel armatures, with surfaces that appeared to be scarred and scorched, these pieces could suggest giant twigs, human limbs or sausages, as well as the aftermath of some mysterious ritual or catastrophe.         In their effort to conjure the body without actually depicting it, these works occupied a territory defined by Eva Hesse and Louise Bourgeois. But the pieces combined a sense of mythic power with a sensitivity to shape that was all their own, achieving a subtlety of expression that belied their monumental scale.         Ms. Unger's work is in the collections of the Hirschhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Brooklyn Museum of Art and the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her most recent solo show was at the Trans Hudson Gallery on West 13th Street in Manhattan in 1997. She had recently completed a series of works that are to be shown at Trans Hudson in May.         She is survived by her husband, Geoffrey Biddle, a photographer and  assistant chairman of photography at the Parsons School of Design; a daughter, Eve; her parents, William and Dorothy Unger of Tenafly, N.J., and a brother, Christopher Unger of Milwaukee.       
         Susan Strasberg, who at 17 electrified Broadway with her luminous portrayal of the title role of ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' and -- with highs and lows professional and private -- went on to a career onstage and in movies, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 60 and also had a home in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, said her stepmother, Anna Strasberg.         As the daughter of Lee Strasberg, the director of the Actors Studio, and the acting coach Paula Miller, Ms. Strasberg spent her childhood surrounded by celebrated figures of the American theater, people who were, she said, ''supremely talented, alive, sensitive, eccentric, and some were neurotic and miserable.''         When she made her Broadway debut as Anne Frank in 1955, she was unknown, except for her last name. She had appeared in an Off Broadway play and had acted in two films, ''The Cobweb'' and ''Picnic,'' that had not been released. And she had never studied acting with her father.         With a naturalness and an authority that belied her limited theatrical experience, she was an astonishing success in her first major role. In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson characterized her as ''a slender, enchanting young lady with a heart-shaped face, a pair of burning eyes and the soul of an actress.''         Ms. Strasberg's father was among those surprised by her performance. He and his wife had tried to talk to her about the interpretation of the role, but then left her to work on her own and with her director, Garson Kanin. ''When we saw Susie in action  we were all amazed at her great sensitivity,'' Mr. Strasberg said at the time. ''I just don't know how she picked it all up. She's never had any formal training.''         Ms. Strasberg was born in Manhattan, and her birth announcement heralded her as ''a four-star hit.'' After working briefly as a model, she made her theatrical debut Off Broadway in ''Maya,'' and followed that with several roles on television, including ''Romeo and Juliet,'' live on the Kraft Television Theater.         She auditioned for the role of Anne Frank, but the producer Kermit Bloomgarden made no decision about casting and the show was postponed. When the play was rescheduled in 1955, Ms. Strasberg was in Hollywood acting in the film of William Inge's ''Picnic.'' Mr. Bloomgarden and Albert and Frances Hackett, the authors of the play ''The Diary of Anne Frank'' asked her to read for the role again.         ''Susan was so terrified at the thought of being rejected that she declined to read at all,'' Mr. Bloomgarden had said in an interview. ''Finally, with tears in her eyes, Susan did read the last, touching scene from play. Within 10 minutes, she knew the part was hers.''         The play was an enormous hit, running for two years and winning the Pulitzer Prize for drama and the New York Drama Critics award and Tony Award for best play. Within the year, she was a certified Broadway star, with her name above the title on the Cort Theater marquee.         In 1957 she starred with Richard Burton and Helen Hayes in Jean Anouilh's ''Time Remembered.'' The next year she was in the Actors Studio revival of Sean O'Casey's ''Shadow of a Gunman'' and then she toured with Franchot Tone in ''Caesar and Cleopatra.'' In 1963 she returned to Broadway in the title role of Franco Zeffirelli's production of ''The Lady of the Camellias.'' When her first two films were released, she was on her way to movie stardom, and was soon playing opposite Henry Fonda in ''Stage Struck.''         Within several years, her career had crested and her private life was in turmoil. In the early 1960's she  was using a wide variety of drugs. When she wrote her autobiography in 1980, it was titled ''Bittersweet,'' a word that seemed to sum up her life. Her marriage to the actor Christopher Jones had ended. Her daughter, Jennifer, was born with a congenital birth defect: Ms. Strasberg blamed herself even though there was no medical evidence linking the drugs and the daughter's disabilities.         A reason she wrote her book, she  said, was that her career was stalled: ''It become totally untenable to me that after acting for 25 years -- I've played Juliet, Cleopatra and Anne Frank -- there I was, sitting in Hollywood, just waiting for somebody to want me.'' Her films include ''Kapo,'' ''The Trip,'' ''Manitou,'' ''Delta Force'' and ''Prime Suspect.'' In the book, she criticized her father for being preoccupied with his acting classes and she criticized her mother for being overly supervisory about her daughter's work.         She was also close to some of her father's students, especially Marilyn Monroe, whom she wrote about in ''Bittersweet'' and in her 1992 book, ''Marilyn and Me, Sisters, Rivals and Friends.''         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Strasberg is survived by her brother, John, who lives in Paris and New York, and by two half-brothers.         Even as Ms. Strasberg's life spiraled, those who saw her in her Broadway debut remembered her as the image of Anne Frank. After that opening night performance, she entered Sardi's with her parents, followed by Ms. Monroe. Before the reviews were read, Mr. Tone offered a toast: ''Little Susan, you have been launched on a long and glittering career.''       
         Virginia Verrill, the on-screen singing voice of some of Hollywood's most famous leading ladies and later a popular radio star, died on Jan. 18 at the Mayview Nursing Home in Raleigh, N.C. She was 82 and lived in Raleigh.         Ms. Verrill, born in Santa Monica, Calif., was a child of Hollywood, where her parents were musicians. At the age of 5 months she appeared in her mother's vaudeville act, and at 3 she made her first public singing appearance when Paul Whiteman, in whose band her father used to play, stood her on a piano while she sang ''I Never Knew I Could Love Anybody'' at the Palais Royale in Times Square. ''And from that minute, I guess,'' she later said, ''singing was what I wanted to do more than anything else.''         At 15, already a veteran of a West Coast band led by Orville Knapp, she was heard performing in a school play and asked to audition for an off-screen role singing ''Ten Cents a Dance'' in Barbara Stanwyck's film of the same name. She beat out more than 300 competitors.         She soon landed work as a professional dubber. Traveling from John Marshall High School in Los Angeles to Hollywood studios almost every day after school, she would sing for leading ladies whose voices were not considered quite up to par.         Disillusioned, Ms. Verrill left Hollywood in 1935 for the ''Socony Sketchbook'' on CBS radio and recorded with the Isham Jones Orchestra.         The tables seemed to turn in 1937, when she was seen on screen in ''Walter Wanger's Vogues of 1938,'' starring Warner Baxter and Joan Bennett. Ms. Verrill sang ''That Old Feeling,'' which became a hit.         The same year she was cast as the female lead in ''The Goldwyn Follies'' and taken under the wing of Samuel Goldwyn.         With newly dyed and styled hair, high heels and lifts in her shoes, Ms. Verrill was presented as ''the second Myrna Loy,'' and stardom seemed almost a certainty.         But the Goldwyn Company decided that the similarities between the two actresses were too strong. Ms. Verrill, who had already recorded the film's soundtrack, suddenly found herself ousted by the actress of the moment, Andrea Leeds, who had become an overnight success that year in ''Stage Door.''         Ms. Verrill abandoned Hollywood in the spring of 1938 for a career in radio and retired in 1942.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Louis Duddleston, and a son, James Breyley Jr., both of Raleigh; a daughter, Diana Caldwell of Anchorage, and seven grandchildren.       
         Sarah (Sadie) Delany, the last of the storied Delany sisters, died peacefully in her sleep at age 109 yesterday at her home in Mount Vernon, N.Y., spokesmen for her family said.         She was the oldest survivor of one of America's most remarkable families, the daughter of a man who had been born a slave, and the first colored woman -- the term she preferred -- ever permitted to teach home economics in white New York City schools.         Miss Delany and her younger sister, Dr. A. Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, were always celebrated in Harlem, where they lived and flourished from 1916 to 1957, after leaving their native Raleigh, N.C.         Dr. Delany, who received her doctorate in dental surgery from Columbia in 1923, was the second black woman licensed to practice dentistry in New York State. She had an office in Harlem and was known to thousands of people only as ''Dr. Bessie.'' She charged $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling and never raised her rates in 27 years of practice.         The sisters gained widespread fame after the publication in 1993 of a memoir they called ''Having Our Say; The Delany Sisters' First 100 Years.'' They wrote it with Amy Hill Hearth as an oral history from their early days in the Jim Crow South to their arrival in New York City during the Harlem Renaissance to their life in a white suburb.         The book, now part of curriculums at hundreds of colleges and high schools, was on the New York Times hardcover best-seller list for 28 weeks and on the paperback list for 77 weeks. They followed it in 1995  with ''The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom.''         In 1995, ''Having Our Say'' was adapted by Emily Mann into a Broadway play that was nominated for three Tony awards. The play followed the sisters in virtually nonstop conversation while they prepared an annual meal celebrating their father's birthday in the home they owned on a dead-end street in Mount Vernon, N.Y.         The sisters lived in that house from 1957 to 1995, and Miss Delany  remained there after Dr. Delany died in 1995 at 104. ''She is my right arm,'' Miss Delany had told an interviewer shortly before her sister's death. ''If she were to die first, I'm not sure I would want to go on living because the reason I am living is to keep her living.''         But Sadie, as her friends called her, kept going, just as the Delany sisters always had. Her last book, with Ms. Hearth, ''On My Own at 107: Reflections on a Life Without Bessie,'' appeared in May 1997.         The sisters liked to say that Dr. Bessie was the acerbic one, who was convinced it was her duty to tell people the truth, whether it concerned race relations or their molars. Sadie would say to her, ''Bessie, don't you realize that people don't want to hear the truth?''         If Dr. Bessie was the vinegar, then Miss Sadie was the molasses, with an uncommon talent for getting along  and for being as sweet as the candy she used to make for extra money as a young teacher.         The Delanys were a mix of hard-working African, white and American Indian stock, a family that was rich in everything but money, reserved, aristocratic and irrepressible even as they suffered through segregation.         Sadie Delany always thought of herself as a ''colored woman'' or, if one insisted on labels, a Negro. She never saw herself as black -- that did not describe her color, she used to say -- nor did she care for the term African-American.         Henry Beard Delany, their gentle, scholarly father, was born into slavery in 1858. The Delanys were house slaves of a St. Marys, Ga., family named Mock, who taught them to read and write. Henry Delany later attended St. Augustine's School in Raleigh and became the first Negro bishop of the Episcopal Church. He met his future wife, Nanny James Logan, at St. Augustine's. Sarah Louise Delany, their second child, was  born Sept. 19, 1889, at an aunt's home in Lynch's Station, Va. She grew up with two sisters and six brothers on  the campus of St. Augustine's, where their father was vice principal.         Happy though they might have been, the South around them was not. The former Confederate states were still reacting to the loss of the war nearly 50 years before. The sisters took different approaches to the Jim Crow laws passed across the south around 1914. In ''Having Our Say,'' Sadie Delany wrote:         ''I'll tell you how I handled white people. There was a shoe store in Raleigh called Heller's. The owner was a Jewish man, very nice. If you were colored, you had to go in the back to try on shoes, and white people sat in front. It wasn't Mr. Heller's fault; this was the Jim Crow law. I would go in there and say, 'Good morning, Mr. Heller, I would like to try on those shoes in the window.' And I would say, 'Where, Mr. Heller?' And he would gesture to the back and say, 'Back there.' And I would say, 'Back where?' Well, I'd just worry that man to death. Finally, he'd say, 'Just sit anywhere, Miss Delany!' And so I would sit myself down in the white section, and smile.         ''Now Bessie thinks that I shouldn't play dumb like that,'' she recalled. ''But I don't care. I got to sit in the white section.''         Sadie Delany liked to say that  when she got her master's degree in education from Columbia in 1925, a white teacher there observed, ''That Sarah Delany. You tell her to do something, she smiles at you, and then she just turns around and does what she wants anyway.''         In this, Miss Delany said, she was ''just like Papa.''         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1910. Her first job was working for the black school system in Wake County, N.C., teaching subjects like sanitation, how to can food and how to care for newborn infants.         Years later, she remembered her students: ''They looked up to me and I showed them it was possible to live a better life, despite what white people were trying to do to us.'' She proudly recalled driving Booker T. Washington around when he visited.         The Delany sisters first saw New York City in 1915, on a visit with their mother. Their father agreed to let them move to New York to attend college. Sadie Delany moved first, in  1916, and Bessie came along a year later. It was one of the rare times when the sisters were separated. Eventually, 9 of the 10 Delany children moved to New York, and all received college educations. Only Lemuel, the oldest, stayed in the South. The sisters are survived by 13 nieces and nephews.         At one point, Sadie, Bessie, Julia, Hubert and Lucius Delany lived together at 2505 Seventh Avenue and West 145th Street in Harlem, each paying a $9 share of the monthly rent. Their neighbors complained.         ''They thought we were running a fast house!'' the two sisters recalled.  ''We don't know why it didn't occur to them that we were brothers and sisters, except that they must have had unclear minds. So we had a little talk with the super and straightened out the whole mess.'' The Delanys had quite a few such talks over the years with people who did not understand them, and they always straightened out the mess.         While she was teaching at Public School 119, Sadie Delany found she could not support herself on the salary, so she started baking cakes and selling them for a nickel a slice to other teachers. She also made lemon and cinnamon lollipops, which she sold for a penny a piece.         People liked her cakes and candies so much that she rented a loft on 121st Street in the late 1920's and made homemade chocolate fondant, a soft, creamy affair. Called ''Delany's Delights,'' it was soon sold all over New York, including Abraham & Straus, at $2 a pound. She closed her business down after the 1929 stock market crash. ''People had no money for chocolate fondant, that's for sure,'' she said.         After years of teaching at predominantly black grade schools, Miss Delany wanted to teach high-school level domestic science, as home economics was then called. She had a master's from Columbia, after all. No Negro had ever done that before. She applied for a job, and received a letter from the Board of Education asking to meet her.         She knew that if the board members saw her, they would not hire her. So she skipped the appointment, sent a polite letter explaining there had been a ''mixup,'' and just showed up at the all-white Theodore Roosevelt High School on the first day of class.         ''They just about died when they saw me,'' she recalled. ''A colored woman!''         She kept the job and spent the rest of her career teaching at excellent high schools before retiring in 1960. Among them were Girls' High School in Brooklyn, Evander Childs High School in the Bronx and Washington Irving High School in Manhattan, where she taught adults at night.         It was lonely, she said. Some of her  fellow teachers, who were all white,  were friendly, she said, ''but you couldn't count on any of them being your real friend.''         She told Ms. Hearth: ''New York was no piece of cake for a colored person, but it was an improvement over the South, child. But don't go thinking I don't love the South. I was born there, and I expect to be buried there, right next to my Mama and Papa. Raleigh will always be home.''         ''Sadie is molasses without even trying,'' her sister once said. ''She can sweet-talk the world, or play dumb, or whatever it takes to get by without a fuss.'' ''         But sometimes the molasses could boil. The Board of Education once sent her what she called a ''nasty'' letter. She had lived for so long that the bean counters had become convinced that she must have died and that somebody else was cashing all those pension checks. She was furious, but as usual straightened it all out.         Toward the end of her life, Sadie Delany did not want anybody to think that she and her sister were just a couple of old women letting life slip by as they sat in their rocking chairs. ''Why, we don't even own a rocking chair,'' she said.         She said she woke up every morning at 6:30, smiled and said, ''Thank you, Lord, for another day.'' Then she would wake up Bessie, a late sleeper, who would open her eyes and say, ''Oh Lord, another day?''         Then they would prepare their food, consuming as many as seven different vegetables a day and lots of fresh fruit. They took vitamin supplements, boiled their water despite assurances that people could drink Mount Vernon water and live. They took up Yoga. They ate milk shakes for dinner, watched the nightly news on public television, said their prayers (extra ones for the people Bessie didn't like) and went to bed.         They believed that their simple lives and good food contributed to their longevity. Bessie said another reason was they ''never had husbands to worry us to death.''         But Sadie Delany said, ''Life is short, and it's up to you to make it sweet.''       
         Ruth Rawlings Mott, who oversaw an array of charitable organizations, died on Monday at her home in Flint, Mich. She was 97.         Mrs. Mott was the widow and a distant cousin of Charles Stewart Mott, a founder of the General Motors Corporation, financier and philanthropist. With him she was active in the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation and other charities in Flint and elsewhere.         After her husband's death in 1973, Mrs. Mott established her own charitable organization, the Ruth Mott Fund, which for the last 20 years contributed more than $1 million a year to hundreds of local and national organizations concerned with the arts, the environment, health and international affairs.         Born in El Paso, Mrs. Mott graduated from the Boston School of Physical Education and opened a dance studio in her hometown. She met Mr. Mott, who had been widowed twice, in 1932, and they married in 1934.         Mrs. Mott is survived by a son, Stewart Rawlings Mott of North Salem, N.Y.; a daughter, Maryanne Turnbull Mott of Santa Barbara, Calif.; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Joan Engel Stern, a ballet dancer, died on Jan. 18 at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, the family said.         Born Shirley Engel in Baltimore, she was known as Joan Engel when she became a professional dancer. In 1945, she became a founding member of a touring troupe formed by the British stars, Alicia Markova and Anton Dolin.         Ms. Engel also appeared in Broadway shows and taught at the American Academy of Dramatic Art.         She is survived by her husband, Irving; a son, Anthony Marc Benjamin, and a daughter, Lisa Stern Lasday, all of New York.       
         Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California artist and conservationist who fought for the survival of sea otters, sea lions, mountain lions and other wild creatures, died on Jan. 21 at Wild Bird, her clifftop home above the Pacific in Big Sur, Calif. She was 85.         The cause was heart failure, reported the Monterey Bay Aquarium, which recently published a paean by her to Mother Nature.         Mrs. Owings, a former member of the California Parks Commission, led campaigns to protect the world's forests and oceans. The National Audubon Society honored her with a medal in 1983 and last year listed her among 100 individuals who had done the most to shape the environmental movement, along with Barry Commoner, Jacques-Yves Cousteau, William O. Douglas, Lady Bird Johnson, Stewart Udall and Morris K. Udall.         A native of Berkeley, Calif., she graduated from Mills College in 1934 and completed graduate studies in art the next year at the Fogg Museum at Harvard University. She had one-woman exhibitions of her stitchery at galleries and folk-art museums but largely set aside her art to work for conservation.         She and her second husband, Nathaniel Alexander Owings, a founding partner of the architectural firm of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, fought to keep the developers away from the wild beauty of Big Sur.         Seasonal residents of Santa Fe, N.M., they also assembled a collection of the art and Pueblo culture of the Southwest, now part of the collection of the California Academy of Sciences in San Francisco.         Mrs. Owings was the founder and first president of Friends of the Sea Otter and won a battle to end the bounty-hunting of mountain lions in her state. As a member of the Point Lobos League she was instrumental in saving the beaches between the Carmel River and Point Lobos State Preserve, near Monterey.         She sat on the council of the Save-the-Redwoods League and the Big Sur Land Trust. She was a past trustee of Defenders of Wildlife, the African Wildlife Leadership Foundation and the Environmental Defense Fund, and a founder of the Rachel Carson Council.         She wrote about her experiences and spent the last months of her life compiling her writings and artwork. The resulting book, ''Voice From the Sea: Reflections on Wildlife and Wilderness'' was published weeks before her death.         Nathaniel Owings, who designed their home, Wild Bird, died in 1984.         Mrs. Owings is survived by a daughter, Wendy M. Benjamin, of Durango, Colo., from her previous marriage to Malcolm Millard, a resident of Carmel, Calif.; three stepdaughters, Natalie O. Prael and Jennifer O. Dewey, both of Santa Fe., and Emily O. Kapozi, of Novato, Calif.; a brother, William Wentworth, of Walnut Creek, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  February 2, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Sunday about Margaret Wentworth Owings, a California conservationist, omitted the name of a surviving stepson. He is Nathaniel O. Owings of Santa Fe, N.M.       
         Virginia Eloise Peterson Abelson, a former bookstore owner and past Democratic Party district leader who also worked in publishing and created crossword puzzles, died on Sunday at her home in Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y. She was 72.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Abelson, a native of Red Oak, Iowa, graduated in 1948 from the University of Iowa, where she majored in English.         During the 1950's, she worked as an advertising director for Cambridge University Press of New York.         In the 1960's, she owned a store called Books Unltd. in Croton. For about 15 years, into the 1980's, she also contributed crossword puzzles that were published in The New York Times.         In the 1960's and 70's, Mrs. Abelson was a party district leader in Croton. She was also a member of the board of the Croton Community Nursery School.         Mrs. Abelson is survived by her husband, Alan, a columnist for Barron's magazine; a daughter, Reed Abelson of Manhattan, a business reporter at The Times; a son, Justin, of Greenfield, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Judith Silberpfennig Kestenberg, a psychoanalyst specializing in child development and the emotional state of Holocaust survivors and their children, died Saturday at her home in Sands Point, N.Y. She was 88.         Dr. Kestenberg headed Child Development Research, which she founded 30 years ago, and Holocaust Child Survivor Studies, both based in Sands Point. With her husband, Milton, she started the research center's International Study of the Organized Persecution of Children.         She and her associates traveled all over the world to collect taped interviews with more than 1,500 child survivors of the Holocaust and their children, as well as the children of Nazis. Fluent in French, German and Polish, she wrote two German books used to teach German children about the Holocaust.         Judith Silberpfennig was born in Tarnov, Poland, and trained in medicine, neurology and psychiatry in Vienna. She came to New York in 1937 and completed her training at Bellevue Hospital and the New York Psychological Institute.         Her husband was born in Lodz, Poland, and became a lawyer there before coming to the United States in 1939. He managed real estate in New York and, after World War II, sued in German courts to seek compensation for Holocaust victims and also organized aid for their children.         They were married in the mid-1940's and became a team in their Holocaust pursuits when he started representing the victims, especially children, before the courts and found that many of them had only vague memories of their ordeals.         Dr. Kestenberg, a professor emeritus at New York University Medical School, taught generations of psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoanalysts and other experts on development, mental health and dance-movement therapy. She also was on the staff and faculty at Long Island Jewish Hospital.         She published seven books and some 150 professional articles. Most recently she edited, with Dr. Charlotte Kahn, ''Children Surviving Persecution: An International Study of Trauma and Healing'' (Greenwood, 1998).         Her other books in print include ''Sexuality, Body Movement and the Rhythms of Development'' (Aronson, 1995); with Dr. Ira Brenner, ''The Last Witness: The Child Survivor of the Holocaust'' (American Psychiatric Press, 1996), and, as editor with Dr. Eva Fogelman, ''Children During the Nazi Reign: Psychological Perspective on the Interview Process'' (Greenwood, 1994).         Milton Kestenberg died in 1991. Dr. Kestenberg is survived by a son, Howard, of Foxborough, Mass.; a daughter, Janet Kestenberg of West Chester, Pa., and four grandchildren.         Her work at Child Development Research is being continued by Dr. Fogelman and associates.       
         Lucille Kallen, the lone woman in the raucous, celebrated and astonishingly untidy group of television writers behind Sid Caesar's ''Your Show of Shows,'' died on Monday at her home in Ardsley, N.Y. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Lise Engel.         ''Your Show of Shows,'' which starred Mr. Caesar and Imogene Coca, was broadcast live for 90 minutes on Saturday nights from 1950 to 1954 and is today revered as a classic of television's golden age. For writers, a job on the program was a coveted plum; many of Ms. Kallen's colleagues, including Mel Brooks, Carl Reiner and Neil Simon, would become show business luminaries in their own right.         The quick-witted, fast-talking gang of writers was so famous that it was memorialized repeatedly in popular culture, including the 1982 film ''My Favorite Year'' (remade as a Broadway musical in 1992) and Mr. Simon's play ''Laughter on the 23d Floor'' (1993). But Ms. Kallen, one of a tiny handful of women employed as television comedy writers in the 1950's, was curiously absent from these works: they featured instead a generic female character who was an amalgam of Ms. Kallen and Selma Diamond, a writer for ''Caesar's Hour,'' which succeeded ''Your Show of Shows.''         The two women were also conflated in the character of Sally Rogers, played by Rose Marie on ''The Dick Van Dyke Show.'' That program, created by Mr. Reiner, starred Mr. Van Dyke as a television comedy writer.         ''Lucille got lost a little bit,'' said Mel Tolkin, the head writer on ''Your Show of Shows.''  ''She was generally the least given credit because the other people are so loud and so famous.''         But if her co-workers barreled into posterity as hit playwrights, movie directors and 2,000-year-old men, Ms. Kallen was, in Mr. Reiner's words, ''a real writer'' -- the profession's most dignified accolade -- who possessed a finely honed ear for dialogue.         ''She was quite a talented girl, and she was cute as a button, too,'' Mr. Reiner, who also performed as Mr. Caesar's second banana on ''Your Show of Shows,'' said recently. ''And being the woman, she did give it the woman's touch.''         In addition, Ms. Kallen was the author of six novels, including the C. B. Greenfield mystery series.         Last year, Ms. Kallen unearthed in her attic a faded piece of paper that neatly encapsulated her craft. The paper contained notes for a sketch in which a wife (Ms. Coca) bemoaned the spark gone from her marriage to Mr. Caesar:         Wife: Where is the sense of adventure? Where is the fun? Where is the romance?         Husband: How do I know where you put things? I can't even find my shirt!         ''This was so typical of their exchanges that I could practically write it in my sleep,'' Ms. Kallen observed in an oral history videotaped last April for the Archive of American Television in Hollywood.         Lucille Kallen was born on May 28, 1922, in Los Angeles. At 3, she moved with her mother to Toronto after her parents separated; she was raised there by her grandparents after her mother's death seven years later. As a girl, she trained to become a concert pianist; as a teen-ager, she founded a theater troupe, for which she wrote songs and sketches.         At 16, Ms. Kallen moved to New York to study at the Juilliard School, but in the years that followed she had two epiphanies that pre-empted her classical-music career: one, her fingers were too short; two, she hated to practice.         She turned instead to writing, putting together a nightclub revue that included the young Martin Balsam. The act was spotted by the producer Max Liebman, who invited Ms. Kallen to hone her craft at Camp Tamiment, a Poconos resort renowned for its Saturday night shows. At Tamiment, she was teamed with Mr. Tolkin, who would become her longtime writing partner. She also met her future husband, Herbert Engel, who worked there as a soda jerk; they were married in 1952. Mr. Engel, a businessman, survives her, as do her daughter, of Manhattan; her son, Paul, of Oceanside, N.Y., and four grandchildren.         On the strength of their Tamiment sketches, Ms. Kallen and Mr. Tolkin were hired to write for a new television show produced by Mr. Liebman, ''The Admiral Broadway Review,'' which paired Mr. Caesar and Ms. Coca for the first time. Undeterred by the fact that she had never even seen a television program, Ms. Kallen signed on, dashing off sketches with Mr. Tolkin in a corner of the male dancers' dressing room. The program, broadcast simultaneously on NBC and the Dumont network from January to June of 1949, was the direct progenitor of ''Your Show of Shows,'' which made its debut on NBC the following year.         As Ms. Kallen recalled, she and her colleagues didn't simply write ''Your Show of Shows,'' they lived it, working seven days a week, 39 weeks a year at the program's offices in midtown Manhattan, producing a series of now-classic sketches, including movie parodies (''From Here to Obscurity''), opera sendups (''Galipacci'') and the weekly travails of the married couple Charles and Doris Hickenlooper for the live broadcast on Saturday night.         In their cramped domain, known as the Writers' Room, the air was blue with cigar smoke and invective and the decor was early fraternity house: dogeared sofa, discarded paper cups crunching underfoot, half-eaten sandwiches abandoned beneath piles of typescript, acoustical-tile ceiling stuck with pencils hurled there in moments of frustration, and widening pools of spilled coffee. ''I learned,'' Ms. Kallen wrote afterward, ''to wear dark skirts.''         As the men paced and the room erupted with jokes and argument, Ms. Kallen was a small, ordered island in a roiling sea, sitting calmly, her legs tucked under her, taking down the good stuff in pencil on a yellow legal pad as it hurtled by, all the while contributing her share. ''She was the only one who could write and talk at the same time,'' Mr. Caesar recalled recently. ''The rest of us were all crazy. It was all being made up at that moment: 'Put it in!'  'Take it out!'  'You've got to put it back!' So it was a very, very frustrating job.''         Most of the writers were extremely large. All of them were extremely loud. Ms. Kallen was 5 foot 1 and, when off duty, spoke with measured thoughtfulness.         ''I was torn between preserving my femininity and preserving my career,'' she later said. ''It was difficult to be forceful enough to get through.''         At one point, she resorted to standing on the sofa and waving a red scarf to command attention. It worked -- briefly.         When ''Your Show of Shows'' went off the air, Ms. Kallen turned down a job with its successor, ''Caesar's Hour'' (1954-57), to write for ''The Imogene Coca Show,'' which lasted only a single season. With Mr. Tolkin, she wrote a short-lived Broadway play, ''Maybe Tuesday'' (1958). In addition to writing five mysteries, she was the author of the novel ''Outside There, Somewhere,'' (1964), a comic, early feminist exploration of the competing demands of career and motherhood.         Reflecting on her Writers' Room days, Ms. Kallen was forthright about the condescension as well as the camaraderie she encountered there. ''At the time I felt it was one big happy family, but later I said, What an idiot!'' she remarked. ''There was a male phalanx, and then there was me. But when we were working, there was no difference.''       
         Dr. Miriam Freund-Rosenthal, a former national president of Hadassah, the Women's Zionist Organization of America, died on Saturday at her home in Miami Beach. She was 92 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Dr. Freund-Rosenthal persuaded the artist Marc Chagall to create the stained glass windows for a synagogue in Jerusalem, endowed Hadassah educational seminars in the United States and Israel and wrote the book 'A Tapestry of Hadassah Memories.'' She and her second husband, Harry Rosenthal, also endowed clinics and parks in Israel through Hadassah.         During her presidency, from 1956 through 1960, a second hospital was built for the Hadassah medical center in Jerusalem, in the Ein Kerem neighborhood. It was dedicated in 1960.         Dr. Freund-Rosenthal, whose doctorate was in history from New York University, was known as Miriam K. Freund when she was Hadassah's president.         With about 300,000 members, Hadassah says it is the United States's largest women's organization, largest Jewish organization and largest Zionist organization.         Before and after Dr. Freund-Rosenthal was Hadassah's president, she held a variety of other posts overseeing the organization's education and youth programs. She was also prominent in other Zionist and Jewish communal organizations.         In a volume of memoirs, ''In My Lifetime'' (1989), she tells of her visit with the violinist Isaac Stern to Chagall in France. The artist agreed to create the design for the stained-glass windows that were to be installed in the synagogue in the Ein Kerem hospital complex, saying, ''I have always looked forward to a call from the Jewish people.'' Known as the Jerusalem windows, they have attracted immense numbers of visitors over the years.         Miriam Kottler Freund-Rosenthal was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Harry Kottler and the former Rebecca Zindler, and lived in Perth Amboy, N.J., and Harlem as a child. She received a bachelor's degree in 1925 from Hunter College and a master's degree and doctorate from N.Y.U. In 1935 she first visited what was then Palestine.         She taught in the New York City public school system for a decade and a half until the early 1940's, and was prominent in fund-raising for the founding of Brandeis University, which opened in 1948.         Her other writings include the books ''Jewish Merchants in Colonial America'' (1939) and ''Jewels for a Crown'' (1963).         In 1927, she married Milton B. Freund, a financier active in Jewish communal and religious affairs, who died in 1968. She married Harry Rosenthal, a businessman in St. Paul in 1974. He died in 1989.         Her survivors include two sons, Dr. Matthew Freund of Miami Beach; and Harry I. Freund of Harrison, N.Y. and Manhattan; 5 grandchildren; 10 great-grandchildren and 2 stepdaughters, Midge Decter of Manhattan, the political writer, and Connie Fields of St. Paul.       
         Bessie Cohen, who as a 19-year-old seamstress escaped the Triangle Shirtwaist fire in which 146 of her co-workers perished in 1911, died on Sunday in Los Angeles. She was 107 and was one of the last two known survivors of the Manhattan fire, according to the Union of Needletrades, Industrial and Textile Employees.         Her son, Jack Kosslyn, an acting teacher and casting director, said she died at the Jewish Home for the Aging in Los Angeles, where she had lived for the last 14 years. Until six weeks ago, he said, she had retained much of her vitality and memory.         Over the years, she had graphically recalled for her family, as well as for historians and documentary filmmakers, what she experienced and witnessed on March 25, 1911, when the worst factory fire in New York history raged through the top three floors of the 10-story Asch Building on the northwest corner of Washington Place and Greene Streets. Inside, about 500 women, mostly Jewish and Italian immigrants, worked behind locked doors making shirtwaists. Shirtwaists were blouses of lightweight fabric, depicted as the uniform of modern womanhood in the illustrations of Charles Dana Gibson.         It was a Saturday afternoon, and Mrs. Cohen, then still Bessie Gabrilowich, was on the ninth floor. She had come alone from Russia to New York two years earlier and had worked in several shops as a stitcher, saving money to bring her sisters to America. The workers were near the end of their 6-day, 52-hour workweek, and since one of the women on the ninth floor had just become engaged, someone had brought a cake, and slices were being passed around.         For the rest of her life, Bessie Cohen would remember that earlier in the day, she had urged her friend, Dora Abramowitz, who was 15, to ask the foreman to give her a 50-cent raise to bring her salary up to the $3 a week that Bessie was earning. At the moment that someone screamed fire, Bessie was teaching a dance step to a fellow worker. The flames were coming up from the cutting room on the floor below.         Within the next 15 minutes, nearly 30 percent of all the Triangle Shirtwaist workers were killed. Mrs. Cohen would later tell her children that after the warning, she went to look for the cheap straw hat she had bought the day before, when she heard a foreman shout to her in Yiddish, ''Bessie, save yourself.'' She looked across the room and could see her friend Dora, looking frightened. But when she looked again, Dora was gone. She was one of those who jumped from the windows and died.         The fire trucks' ladders could reach only to the seventh floor. Firefighters held nets below, but so many women were jumping at the same time that the nets tore and did not hold them. Some rushed to the elevator shaft, hoping to escape by sliding down the cables, only to lose their grip. Most of those who lost their lives had worked on the ninth floor.         Later inquiries found that doors leading from the shop areas had been locked, presumably to keep the women at their sewing machines. The owners, who were tried for manslaughter, were acquitted when the jury could not establish whether they had ordered the doors locked or had even known they were locked. But in 1914, civil suits brought by relatives of 23 victims ended with payments of $75 to each of the families.         On the day of the fire, Mrs. Cohen would recall, she somehow found her way to a staircase and covered her face with her purse as she ran to the street.         The next day, she returned to the street outside the building, where the bodies were arrayed so that friends and relatives might identify them. A newspaper photographer took a picture of her as she collapsed at the sight; Mr. Kosslyn said his mother kept that newspaper picture throughout her life.         She took other jobs, he said, and became active in the International Ladies Garment Workers Union, whose organizing efforts gained momentum after the fire. Two years before the blaze, a three-month strike of about 20,000 shirtwaist workers in New York City and Philadelphia had helped to entrench the union and had focused public attention on conditions in sweatshops. The needletrades union is a successor to the International Ladies Garment Workers.         At least one survivor of the fire is still living, according to The Associated Press. Rose Freedman, 105, of Beverly Hills, Calif., escaped by fleeing to the roof, her family said.         The Triangle Shirtwaist fire has become the most vivid symbol of the struggle for workplace safety. As outrage mounted after the fire, the union intensified its demands for safer working conditions. A huge crowd of sympathizers, Mrs. Cohen among them, paraded in mourning to the arch in Washington Square Park. Hearings were held, and by the end of 1911, the city of New York had established a Bureau of Fire Investigation, headed by the future Senator, Robert F. Wagner, who was later the father of the Wagner Labor Act. The bureau had the power to impose and enforce safety regulations.         The Asch Building, its interior long since gutted and rebuilt, became a part of New York University and still stands.         In 1915, Bessie married and moved with her husband, Lewis Cohen, to New London, Conn., where her son and daughter were born. For many years after the fire, her son said, she would react fearfully to thunder and lightning, burying her head in her arms and sobbing.         The family moved to Passaic, N.J., and then to New York. In 1940, after her marriage ended, she moved to Los Angeles, where her son was living. Mrs. Cohen, an independent woman, lived on her own until she was 93 in the Boyle Heights neighborhood, staying on after most of the Jewish residents had left.         When she was 89, she was mugged and had her jaw fractured by two men who took her purse, which contained a bus pass and 60 cents.         After two weeks, she returned to her home and neighbors, sipping liquids through her wired jaw for months. When she finally did leave for the nursing home, about 200 of her neighbors, almost all of them Hispanic, saluted her with a festive street party.         She is survived by her son, Jack, of Los Angeles, and a daughter, Sylvia Scott of Calistoga, Calif. A grandson, Jan Tangen, died last year.       
         Sarah Kane, a provocative playwright whose bleak view of the limitations of human relationships and graphic dramatizations of violence and sex earned her a reputation as an enfant terrible of the British theater, died on Saturday at King's College Hospital here. She was 28.         She was found hanged in her room at the hospital, where she was being treated for depression, friends said. The police said they considered the case a suicide.         Ms. Kane exploded onto the London theater scene at 23 with her nihilistic first play, ''Blasted,'' a precocious debut that shocked critics and brought her tabloid denunciations as a promoter of depravity. The play depicted a rampaging soldier raping another man and then gouging out his eyes, eating his tongue and forcing him to cannibalize a dead baby.         No play or playwright had caused such outrage since Edward Bond had an infant being stoned to death in a baby carriage in his play ''Saved'' 30 years earlier on the same Royal Court stage. The theater, which has had a policy of presenting bold new playwrights since its 1956 success with John Osborne's groundbreaking  ''Look Back in Anger,'' stuck by Ms. Kane and staged two of the three other plays she was to write in her short, high-profile career.         One of them, last May's ''Cleansed,'' brought forth a fresh cascade of negative comment with scenes that included the injection of heroin into an eyeball, a savage amputation and a rape with a broom handle. Her other works were  ''Phaedra's Love,'' an adaptation of Seneca, produced at the Gate in 1996,  and ''Crave,'' which opened at last year's Fringe Festival in Edinburgh before moving on to the Royal Court.         Early performances of ''Crave'' listed a pseudonymous author, an effort on her part to free the play from the unwanted celebrity that ''Blasted'' had brought her. She said she had been wounded by the bad publicity, and according to a newspaper account, confided to a friend that ''the only good journalist is a dead journalist.''         While the dominant view of her work was typified by The Daily  Mail's verdict that ''Blasted'' was ''a disgusting feast of filth,'' there were critics who found courage and honesty in her work. One classed her tormented visions as ''the bleached language of truth and poetry'' depicting a world in which love and violence are intertwined.         Reviewing ''Cleansed,'' Benedict Nightingale of The Times of London wrote: ''She is not the gloating opportunist that some reviewers of 'Blasted' thought. She has no less integrity than Pinter or Bond, but, God knows, I would hate to live in her head.''         In contrast to the ferocity of her words, in person she was a pale, thin, soft-spoken presence, living alone in Brixton in South London and writing feverishly in the early morning hours instead of sleeping. She spoke of her moments of mental affliction with a grim appreciation, saying:  ''Many people feel depression is about emptiness, but actually it's about being so full that everything cancels itself out. You can't have faith without doubt, and what are you left with when you can't have love without hate?''         The daughter of a journalist, Ms. Kane grew up in Brentwood in suburban Essex County, east of London, in a household that went through an obsessive Christian redemption process during her youth. At 17 she turned her back on religion, saying that her family's experience was ''a spirit-filled, born-again lunacy.''         To critics of her dramas' dependence on savagery, she said: ''The reading I did in my formative years was the incredible violence of the Bible. It was full of rape, mutilation, war and pestilence.''         She was drawn to theater as a teen-ager, directing school productions of Chekhov's ''Bear'' and Joan Littlewood's ''Oh, What a Lovely War!'' She went on to Bristol University, where she graduated with honors in drama, and to Birmingham University, where she got a master's degree in playwriting.         She was a writer in residence at the experimental company Paines Plough, working with emerging writers at the urging of her friend and fellow playwright Mark Ravenhill, the author of ''Shopping and . . .,'' which played at the New York Theater Workshop last year. She ran workshops in Bulgaria and Spain with the Royal Court International summer school, and her plays were produced by a number of continental companies.         ''People in Britain never realized the extent of her fame throughout Europe,'' said Michael Billington, the  drama critic of The Guardian. ''Wherever I went, I found an extraordinary curiosity about her work and what it said about contemporary Britain.''         Mr. Ravenhill said that Ms. Kane ''talked about suicide all the time -- so much so that it became a joke.'' Her last play ''Crave,'' ends with a suicide, and, interviewed about the play recently, Ms. Kane said: ''Some people seem to find release at the end of it, but I think it's only the release of death. In my other plays it was the release of deciding to go on living despite the fact that it's terrible.''       
         Indrani, a distinguished dancer who familiarized Americans with several styles of India's classical dance as a performer and teacher, died on Friday in Beekman Downtown Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, her daughter, Sukanya Wicks, said.         Indrani was an artist of international repute and often appeared before heads of state in her native India and abroad. But she also became a highly respected figure in the dance world of New York after her debut there in 1960. The hallmark of her dancing, a blend of dramatic vibrancy and technical refinement, carried over to her teaching at American colleges and festivals.         Although she had a home in New Delhi until recently, she spent most of the last two decades in the United States, where she toured extensively. In 1961, Indrani was the first dancer presented on a national tour by the Asia Society. She had been on the faculty of the Juilliard School since 1976.         ''Indrani was an exquisite dancer, a great teacher and a true rasika, in the largest spirit of that word, meaning a lover of the arts,'' Rachel Cooper of the Asia Society said yesterday. Ms. Cooper, associate director of the society's performing arts and public programs, also praised Indrani's role as a producer of concerts in New York by younger Indian dancers. She said the society had planned to give Indrani a lifetime achievement award. ''The event will now be a memorial as well,'' Ms. Cooper said.         Unlike many Indian dancers of her generation, Indrani did not specialize in a single school of classical dance but studied with leading gurus in India to master the contrasting styles of Bharata Natyam, Kuchipudi, Mohini Attam and Orissi.         In the 1950's, Indrani was the first professional dancer to perform Orissi onstage; Orissi, then a neglected dance form, was inspired by temple sculpture in the state of Orissa, in eastern India. Indrani was instrumental in the revival of Orissi, introducing it to audiences in India by touring widely there and doing the same abroad when she performed as a soloist or with her ensemble of musicians and dancers.         In championing rarely seen or forgotten classical dance forms, Indrani followed naturally in the footsteps of her mother, Ragini Devi, an American-born dancer who was internationally known for her leading role in the revival of classical dance in India in the 1930's.         As Esther Sherman in Petoskey, Mich., the future Ragini Devi was already in love with Indian dance when she met Ramlal Bajpai in Minneapolis. After she married Bajpai, an Indian scientist and activist for Indian independence, she traveled to India to study dance in 1930. Their daughter, Indrani, was born that year in Madras. In her book ''Dance Dialects of India,'' Ragini Devi described how she would take the infant Indrani on her own visits to gurus. As a dancer, Indrani was her  ''alter ego,'' Ragini Devi wrote. ''Her dance career is a continuation of mine.''         Ragini Devi, who died in 1982, made her last stage appearance at a memorable concert in 1979 at New York University. She was joined by Sukanya, Indrani's daughter and also a dancer, as well as Indrani. The vivacity of all three generations came into play.         Indrani's playfulness and gaiety at that performance were typical of her vivid personality. In the dramatic Kuchipudi solos, Indrani's quick shifts in characterization were always subtle and deep.         Having started at age 5 in her mother's company, she was steeped in the content of classical dance. As a professional, she began with Bharata Natyam, where she could display the rhythmic complexity of her footwork. But mime within this style and in others allowed her to exhibit her brilliant dramatic gifts.         The Indian Government sponsored Indrani's tours. Her warmth and artistry, as well as the beauty of her costumes and presentations, made her a perfect choice. In 1961 she performed for President John F. Kennedy and Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru during Nehru's official visit to Washington. Indrani received the Indian Government's national award, Padma Shri, and the Sangeet Natak Akadami Award in the performing arts.         Indrani married Habib Rahman, who was named India's chief architect and who died in 1995. In addition to her daughter, of Orr's Island, Me., she is survived by her son, Ram Rahman, of New Delhi, and two grandsons, Wardreath Wicks of Orr's Island, and Habib Wicks of New York City.       
         Pearl Bernstein Max, who played a central role in melding the New York City municipal colleges into today's City University of New York, died Thursday in her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 94.         In 1938, Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed Mrs. Max -- known as Pearl Bernstein for much of her career -- as the first administrative director of New York City's Board of Higher Education. That job, the chief administrator, was a predecessor of the office of Chancellor in the current system.         Mrs. Max helped lay much of the groundwork for fitting City, Hunter, Brooklyn and Queens Colleges into CUNY, as it came into being in 1961. She drafted the first master plan and the financing formula for the system and served as liaison to its Administrative Council of College Presidents.         She was the founding coordinator of CUNY's Office of Institutional Research in 1967. From there, she initiated pioneering studies of teacher education, admissions procedures and other issues of vital importance to the growing university.         Thus, Mrs. Max was one of the principal shapers of CUNY, the nation's largest municipal university system. It now comprises 11 senior colleges, 6 community colleges, a graduate division, a law school, a medical school and an affiliated school of medicine. It has nearly 200,000 students working toward degrees and 155,000 adult and continuing education students throughout the five boroughs.         Mrs. Max also served as secretary and administrative head of the New York City Employees Retirement System, one of the country's largest pension funds. She taught courses on state and local government at Barnard College, and retired from CUNY in 1969.         A native of Manhattan, she graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Barnard in 1925 and pursued postgraduate studies at Columbia University and Fordham Law School. She joined the League of Women Voters of New York City in 1926 as its municipal representative and the group's first paid executive.         The league monitored the policies and procedures of the city's Board of Estimates and Apportionment. Her reputation for clear and evenhanded analyses drew the attention of Mayor La Guardia, who named her secretary of the board in 1934.         She was the first woman in that post, which she held until the Mayor moved her to the Board of Higher Education. Over the years she served as an officer of the Women's Club of New York, Ethical Culture Schools, Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith, New York Metropolitan Council and American Society of Public Administrators, among other organizations.         Her husband, Dr. Louis W. Max, died four years ago after 66 years of marriage. Mrs. Max is survived by a daughter, Dr. Claire Max of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Dr. Betty Bernstein of Manhattan and Hilda Morris of Huntington, N.Y.; two brothers, Ira Bernstein of Fairfield, Conn., and Seymour Bernstein of Manhattan, and one grandson.       
         Dorothea Zack Hanle, a longtime editor at Bon Appetit, a cookbook writer and one of the founders of Les Dames d'Escoffier, an international women's organization that promotes fine dining and wine, died Tuesday at the home of her son, Alan, in North Brunswick, N.J. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan and Ship Bottom, N.J.         Ms. Hanle was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Ship Bottom, where her father, Richard A. Zachariae, was a real estate agent. Throughout her life, she was called Zack.         After attending Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., and Barnard College, she was hired by Mademoiselle, where she wrote on a wide range of subjects. Dell Publishing took note of her flair for dispensing useful advice and hired her as editor in chief of its special-projects division. At Dell, she wrote and edited more than 65 pocket-size how-to handbooks, and in 1964, under the name Dorothea Zack Hanle, wrote the book ''The Hairdo Handbook: A Complete Guide to Hair Beauty.''         In 1972, CBS Publications wooed her to edit a new publication, Epicure, but she remained at Dell, editing the first issue of Epicure under the pen name Carter Chase. She then left Dell and edited Epicure for two years under her own name, and later edited another CBS magazine, Everywoman's, which competed with Family Circle.         In 1976 she joined the staff of Bon Appetit, where she created several columns and features, including  ''The Bon Vivant,'' ''Entertaining With . . .'' and ''Profiles in Cooking.'' According to Tanya W. Steel, a senior editor for the magazine, her byline appeared more often than that of any other writer.         She was Bon Appetit's New York editor until 1990, when she was named an editor at large. From 1997 until her death she was a consultant to the magazine.         Her books include ''The Surfer's Handbook'' (1968), ''Cooking With Flowers'' (1971) and ''Cooking Wild Game'' (1974). With Martin Herz, she wrote a children's cookbook, ''The Golden Ladle'' (1945). She also wrote books on gardening, diet and exercise.         In 1990, Ms. Hanle was honored by the James Beard Foundation at its first annual Editor's Dinner.         She is survived by her son; a daughter, Jennifer Malahowski of Austin, Tex., and three grandchildren.       
         Judge Mary Johnson Lowe, a Federal judge in the Southern District of New York who was known for her rulings in discrimination cases, died  Saturday at a hospital in Las Vegas, Nev. She was 74 and had homes in the Bronx and Las Vegas.         The cause was heart failure, and she had been in declining health, a daughter, Leslie H. Lowe, said.         Judge Lowe was the second black woman appointed to the Federal judiciary, according to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education. She was recommended by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and appointed by President Carter in 1978. At the time, there were 400 Federal trial judges, 15 of whom were black and 5 of whom were female.         As a senior judge, a status she acquired in 1991, she sat on the bench here for part of the year, and had been doing some judicial work while in Las Vegas.         Earlier, she was a judge of the Criminal Court of the City of New York from 1971 until 1973, when she was named an Acting State Supreme Court Justice assigned to the Manhattan Supreme Court's Centralized Narcotics Term. She held that post, sitting in Manhattan, until 1974. She served on the Supreme Court in Bronx County in 1975 and 1976. In 1977 she was elected a justice of the State Supreme Court.         In 1984, in District Court in Manhattan, she issued a widely noted injunction barring New York City from ''refusing to allow homeless individuals to register to vote on the ground that they fail to inhabit traditional residences.'' She said the city's Board of Elections had defined the term ''residence'' to exclude ''an entire group of otherwise eligible voters,'' estimated at the time at 20,000.         In the ruling, she said that voter residency requirements could be satisfied by ''homeless individuals identifying a specific location within a political community which they consider their home base, to which they return regularly, manifest an intent to remain for the present, and from which they can receive messages and be contacted.''         In 1981 she ruled that a New York City pension system, which assumed that women lived three years longer than men, discriminated illegally against women by requiring them to make higher contributions even though they received lower monthly benefits when they retired.         One of the most controversial cases she handled was a 1988 racketeering trial in which the jury convicted eight men, including the reputed former head of the Genovese crime family. The conviction was overturned with unusually harsh language when the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that Judge Lowe had prevented the presentation of important evidence. ''This was an error of constitutional magnitude,'' the appellate judges wrote.         She was a visiting lecturer at Harvard Law School. The honors she received included a New York State Bar Association award for her ''outstanding judicial contribution to the criminal justice system.''         Judge Lowe was born in Manhattan and grew up in Harlem. She received a bachelor's degree in 1952  from Hunter College, a law degree with honors in 1954 from Brooklyn Law School, where she was president of her class and the first black editor in chief of the law review, and a master's degree in 1955 from Columbia Law School.         Judge Lowe's marriages to Edward Hatfield Lowe and Ivan A. Michael ended in divorce. She is survived by two daughters, Bess Michael of Washington, and Leslie, of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Edward H. Lowe of Edison, N.J.; a granddaughter; two sisters, Eddie Johnson Carkhum of Teaneck, N.J., and Ann J. Bolton of Los Angeles, and four brothers, Harry Johnson and Dr. James J. Johnson, both of Teaneck, and Dr. John William Johnson and Robert Johnson, both of the Bronx.       
         Marian Searchinger, a New York theatrical agent, died on Monday at a convalescent home in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 81.         Ms. Searchinger's clients included such actors as Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee and Jane Alexander, the television writer Ernest Kinoy and the directors Franklin Schaffner and Fielder Cook. She also represented the poet Langston Hughes, the lyricist Hal David and the playwright Roger Hirson. She worked as an agent at Creative Management Associates (now International Creative Management) from the 1950's to the early 80's, and then joined NBC, where she worked on literary acquisitions and daytime programming.         She is survived by her husband, Gene; a daughter, Jill; two sons, Brian and Tim, and a sister, Renee Cohen.       
         Elizabeth Huckaby, who as a vice principal shepherded nine black students through the tumultuous integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Ark., in 1957, died on March 18 in Little Rock.         Mrs. Huckaby, whose memoir, ''Crisis at Central High,'' inspired a 1981 television movie recounting the landmark civil rights confrontation, was 93.         In September 1957, Mrs. Huckaby was about to enter her 28th year at Central High. A native of Hamburg, Ark., the daughter of a Presbyterian minister and a graduate of the University of Arkansas, she was accustomed to the ways of the South. As she remembered it, ''I had never known any black well, except those in household employ.''         Soon, she would be trying to shield the first black students at Central High from intimidation by white students.         As an outgrowth of the Supreme Court's 1954 desegregation decision, the Little Rock school board admitted nine blacks to Central High for the 1957-58 school year. But Gov. Orval E. Faubus called out the National Guard to prevent their entry. President Dwight D. Eisenhower sent the 101st Airborne Division to Little Rock and placed the Arkansas guardsmen under Federal control to insure the black students' admission in the face of mob action.         On one occasion, 50 boys gathered atop the stairs at the school's entrance when no troops were in sight and shouted racial epithets at the blacks as they approached.         Melba Pattillo Beals, in her memoir, ''Warriors Don't Cry'' (Pocket Books, 1994), recalled what happened as she and other black students were about to retreat:         ''Vice Principal Huckaby made her presence known at the bottom of the stairs. Tiny, erect, and determined, she stood there all alone between us and our attackers, demanding they leave us alone. One by one she challenged the leaders, calling them by name, telling them to get to class or there would be hell to pay. Whether or not she favored integration, she had a heck of a lot of guts.''         The best-remembered image of the Little Rock events is a photograph showing a white girl, her face contorted in rage, screaming at Elizabeth Eckford, a black girl entering the school.         Mrs. Huckaby, the vice principal for girls and an English teacher, took the white student to her office.         ''I told her, hatred destroys the people who hate,'' Mrs. Huckaby recalled. ''She shrugged. Well, that was the way she felt, she said. Wasted breath.''         Mrs. Huckaby later persuaded Miss Eckford to remain in school after she came to her office in tears over continuing harassment.         The tensions took their toll on Mrs. Huckaby, who testified at a June 1958 court hearing: ''I would lie awake at night wondering what I could do. I had no social life at all because on weekends I was too tired. I would go out to the country and just sit.''         Eight of the nine black students remained through the school year, and at commencement ceremonies on May 27, 1958, Ernest Green became the first black graduate of Central High. Mrs. Huckaby stayed at the school until retiring in 1969. ''Crisis at Central High'' (Louisiana State University Press, 1980), based on journals she had kept during the confrontation, was made into a CBS movie that brought Joanne Woodward an Emmy nomination for her portrayal of Mrs. Huckaby.         Mrs. Huckaby is survived by a sister, Clara Doyle, of Danville, Calif., and a brother, Clifton Paisley, of Tallahassee, Fla.         Mrs. Huckaby, who did not consider herself a social crusader, would recall having told Daisy Bates of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Arkansas that ''since my field was education, my immediate goal was having the black children in school as just ordinary children.''         She supported school integration, believing, she said, that ''no public school system segregated by law on the basis of race is consistent with democracy.''       
         Lucienne Bloch, an acclaimed muralist whose most significant contribution to art may have been a series of surreptitious photographs she took in 1933, died on March 13 at her home in Gualala, Calif. She was 90.         She was the photographer whose sneak pictures taken behind enemy lines on May, 8, 1933, are the sole visual record of the great Diego Rivera's ill-fated Rockefeller Center fresco with its doomed depiction of Lenin.         At a time of economic distress, when capitalism itself seemed vulnerable to competing currents of social change, if anybody was going to pin Lenin on a capitalist wall it was Diego Rivera, the fiery Mexican muralist whose artistic acclaim was matched only by his reputation as a fiercely committed, if renegade, Communist.         If anybody was going to stop him it was John D. Rockefeller Jr.'s son, Nelson A. Rockefeller, who had commissioned Rivera to paint a 1,000-square-foot fresco, ''Man at the Crossroads,'' in the great hall of the new RCA Building, the soaring Rockefeller Center capstone now known as the G.E. Building and at the time an especially potent symbol of capitalism.         Sure enough, when it became apparent that Rivera was intent on portraying Lenin as a charismatic leader, Rockefeller asked him to substitute an anonymous figure, and Rivera refused.         Realizing his work was doomed, Rivera hired a photographer to take pictures of the mural, but Rockefeller, determined that there be no record of what the family regarded as desecration of their property, had guards at the building thwart the effort.         Aware that the mural would be sealed off the next day, the Rockefellers could be complacent, but only because they had not reckoned on  Miss Bloch, an unpaid Rivera assistant who seemed an unlikely foot soldier in his anti-capitalist cause.         A Geneva-born daughter of the celebrated Swiss composer, Ernst Bloch, she was a child of privilege who had come to the United States with her family in 1917 and lived in Cleveland until 1925, when her father became director of the San Francisco Conservatory of Music and her mother, aware that the composer would be comforted by mistresses, took her children to Paris.         There, Miss Bloch studied sculpture at the Ecole des Beaux Arts and made a yearlong side trip to the Netherlands, studying at the Leerdam glass works and turning out such impressive glass sculptures that she had a one-woman show in New York in 1931 and was invited by Frank Lloyd Wright to teach at his Wisconsin school.         By then, however, she had become fascinated by another art. Shortly after her arrival in New York in 1931, she was invited to a banquet honoring Rivera in connection with his famous one-man show at the Museum of Modern Art. Largely because Rivera spoke little English and no one else spoke Spanish, the 22-year-old Miss Bloch, who spoke French, a language Rivera also knew, was seated next to the great man.         During their animated conversation, a dark-haired woman came up behind Miss Bloch and said, ''I hate you,'' a comment of such disarming candor that Miss Bloch burst out laughing. The woman was Rivera's wife, the tortured artist Frida Kahlo, whose husband's philandering gave her reason to fear the worst, but not, as it happened, from Miss Bloch.         As the the daughter of a womanizing father, Miss Bloch made clear, she had no designs on Kahlo's womanizing husband, a pledge that laid the groundwork for a remarkable friendship.         Over the next few years, Miss Bloch worked on Rivera's controversial mural at the Detroit Institute of Art and on the Rockefeller Center project, along the way falling in love with the artist's chief plasterer, Stephen P. Dimitroff, a young Bulgarian immigrant, and immortalizing their romance in lyrical passages in her diary, which a granddaughter, Lucienne Allen, plans to use as the basis for a book.         The couple, who eventually married, became an artistic team, he handling the plaster and she the painting for frescoes all over the country, including her most acclaimed work, ''The Evolution of Music,'' at George Washington High School in upper Manhattan.         They lived for a time in Flint, Mich., where he became a union organizer and she photographed strikes for Life and other publications, before eventually moving to Mill Valley, Calif., where Mr. Dimitroff, who died in 1996, operated a frame shop until the couple retired to Gualala in 1965.         After a lifetime devoted to art, including wide-ranging sculptures in glass, wood and terra cotta and a famous series of photographs of Kahlo, Miss Bloch is nevertheless largely recalled for her association with another artist's work, but, then, the artist was Rivera, widely regarded as a 20th century giant, and her photographs are all that remain of his most famous work.         For that, Miss Bloch, who is survived by two sons, George Ernst Dimitroff of Tumwater, Wash., and Pancho Dimitroff of Aurora, Colo; a daughter, Sita Milchev, of Gualala; a sister, Suzanne Bloch Smith of New York; 8 grandchildren and 6 great-grandchildren, had only herself to blame.         It was she, after all, on the night after Rivera's hired photographer had been thwarted, who slipped a camera under her blouse and walked boldly into the RCA building with Mr. Dimitroff and Kahlo, who distracted the guards while Miss Bloch climbed up on the scaffold and proceeded to photograph the mural.         The next day, in what has been likened to a military operation, the mural was shrouded from public view.         Nine months later, after the resulting furor had subsided, it was scraped into oblivion -- almost.         Rivera did a copy in Mexico City, complete with Lenin, but it is only Miss Bloch's photographs that show it as it was -- on a Rockefeller wall.         Correction:  April 6, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary of the muralist Lucienne Bloch on March 28 misspelled the given name of her father. He was Ernest Bloch, not Ernst.       
         Helen Priest Rogers, an authority on dance notation, a co-founder of the Dance Notation Bureau and a pioneer in the use of film to preserve choreography, died on Mar. 2 at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Brattleboro, Vt. She was 85 and lived in West Brattleboro.         Ms. Rogers, who studied modern dance with Martha Graham and performed with the Graham company in 1935, went to Germany in 1936 at Graham's suggestion to learn the new system of Labanotation.         In 1940 she, Eve Gentry, Janey Price and Ann Hutchinson founded the Dance Notation Bureau in New York. It remains one of the world's most important centers for notation research.         Ms. Rogers also believed in recording choreography on film. She made her first dance films at the  Bennington Dance Festivals of the 1930's. After World War II, she taught notation for the American Dance Festival when it was at Connecticut College in New London. From its first season there in 1948 until 1976, when Ms. Rogers turned over her project to other cinematographers, she supervised the filming of 75 productions, including works by  Graham, Merce Cunningham and Paul Taylor.         Ms. Rogers, who was married to the Canadian artist Hubert Reginald Rogers, was born in Ogdensburg, N.Y., and attended St. Lawrence University and Columbia University.         She taught dance and notation at various colleges and directed the dance program at Mount Holyoke College from 1953 to 1975.         She is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Scott of Whately, Mass.; a son, Norman Rogers of West Brattleboro; a stepdaughter, Jean Rogers of Provincetown, Mass; a sister, Alice Dunn of Big Arm, Mont.; a brother, Dorman Priest of Amherst, Mass., and three grandchildren.       
         Lila Hotz Luce Tyng, the first wife of Henry R. Luce, founder of Time Inc., died on Wednesday at her home in Gladstone, N.J., five days after her 100th birthday.         Mrs. Tyng, the mother of Mr. Luce's children, was a leading figure in New York's social and philanthropic circles for several decades.         Though overshadowed in history by the editor's famous second wife, the author Clare Boothe Luce, Mrs. Tyng played an important role in the life of Mr. Luce, who sought her advice even after they were divorced, said Robert E. Herzstein, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina and the author of ''Henry R. Luce'' (Scribner, 1994).         Lila Hotz was born in Chicago in 1899, the daughter of Robert Schuttler Hotz, an inventor and financier, and Lila Ross Hotz. On New Year's Eve 1919, she met the young Luce through one of his Yale classmates, Thornton Wilder; they were married in 1923.         The young wife hoped that Time's growing success would eventually allow her workaholic husband to join her in the kind of social whirl she loved. But they divorced in 1935, not long after Mr. Luce met Clare Boothe, whose literary and journalistic drives and interests better matched his own. ''Lila was devastated when Luce confronted her with his intention to divorce her,'' Dr. Herzstein said. ''But they maintained a closeness and were in constant contact, often discussing their children's education and careers, among other things.''         Mrs. Tyng and Mr. Luce, who died in 1967, had two sons: Henry Luce 3d,  chairman and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation in New York City, and Peter Paul Luce of Englewood, Colo.         In 1939, she married Sewell Tappan Tyng, a lawyer, author, head of a mining company and assistant to the New York City District Attorney, Thomas E. Dewey. She became a fixture in New York society, serving on the boards of several institutions,  including the Henry Street Settlement, the Berkshire Farm School, the Spence-Chapin Adoption Service  and the Grosvenor Neighborhood House. She once reported attending 36 balls in 36 weeks.         Besides her two sons, Mrs. Tyng is survived by six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Edith Anderson, an American writer who defied postwar ruin and harsh political realities to resettle in divided Berlin with her German Communist husband and lived just long enough to see her cold war memoir published and praised as a literary event, died on Tuesday at her home in Berlin. She was 83.         Ms. Anderson, whose last name was originally Handelsman, had returned to Berlin on April 7 after two weeks in New York to promote her new book, ''Love in Exile,'' published in March by Steerforth Press of South Royalton, Vt.         The product of decades of reminiscences, journalism and correspondence, the book traces Ms. Anderson's odyssey from a conservative Jewish upbringing in the Bronx, to a stint at the Communist newspaper Daily Worker, to encounters with Richard Wright, Simone de Beauvoir, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym and other literati. She also wrote of her consuming romance with Max Schroeder, a surrealist poet, editor and antifascist whom she married and followed from his wartime exile in New York back to Soviet-controlled East Germany in 1947.         ''Love in Exile'' has been hailed by Grace Paley, Doris Lessing and Vivian Gornick, among other writers, as a sharp and gripping portrait of an ideological and human landscape as foreign to today's Americans as the dark side of the moon. A review in The New York Times Book Review  found the book most affecting when Ms. Anderson recounted her domestic anguish and search for love outside the marriage.         In an early section, she described how she landed her job at The Daily Worker in 1942, when she was 26.         ''Hastening down Broadway to my Marxist analyst who charged only $5 a session because I was unemployed (he too was still young) I bumped into a former college crony named Milton. He hailed me joyously. 'You're just the person I need!' He told me he was cultural editor of The Daily Worker but had just been drafted into the Army and must find a replacement by the weekend.''         She was overwhelmed. She would scrub floors at The Daily Worker. But she had no newspaper experience. She wrote:         '' 'I'll break you in,' he said.         '' 'In three days?         '' 'Less.' ''         She asked herself how she had the nerve to pass herself off as cultural editor. ''My analyst brushed these scruples aside. He was delighted that I had a real challenge to bite into; life, as Marx said, was a struggle and I was no more a fraud than anyone else.''         Still, she was soon dismissed and ended up as one of the women on train crews hired to replace men called to war. Shortly afterward, she met Mr. Schroeder, a craggy and mesmerizing onetime bohemian 17 years her senior. He had escaped from Nazi captivity in Vichy, France, and was editing an anti-fascist publication in New York.         After he returned to Germany in 1946, she followed the next year, via Paris, after almost joining the American Army in a desperate effort to enter restricted Berlin at a time when almost everyone there would have given anything to get out. She was to remain, with only intermittent visits home, for the next 52 years, although her husband died in 1958. They had a daughter, Cordelia, who still lives in Berlin.         In ''Love in Exile,'' Ms. Anderson said that as a widow she considered returning to the United States with her daughter but was deterred by the imagined voice of Max: ''What right have you to deprive her of the Socialism for which so many people died or went into exile? It may be imperfect but something can be made of it.'' The book ends in 1962.         Although clearly enamored of Marxism since youth, Ms. Anderson was not overtly political, said her childhood friend, the writer Helen Yglesias, a classmate at James Monroe High School in the Bronx. ''She was highly sympathetic to Max's idealism and his hope that a just society could be built,'' she said.         But she was a sharp and often corrosive chronicler of the death throes of the German Democratic Republic as Communism collapsed and the Berlin Wall fell in 1989: ''a kaleidoscope rolling downhill,'' as she described it.         In an account of the final days, later included in an anthology, ''Without Force or Lies'' (1990), she wrote of traveling through East Germany in a train compartment with her grandson and watching a young man and woman, strangers, suddenly shed their inhibitions and take up the taboo subject of politics.         The man, agitated, ripped off his tie, warning that East Germans  ''had just about had it,'' she wrote.         '' 'I give it one more year before something busts,' he said.         '' 'Six months,' she replied.''         Her grandson grew alarmed and Ms. Anderson sought to calm him. ''But I felt my own scalp creep, as if some law of nature had had broken, a sheep instead of baaing shouted in a human voice, 'Enough!'         ''The young woman had hit it right on the nose: six months. The unthinkable happened here.''         At the same time, Ms. Anderson also wrote acidly of the former West Germans ''tramping around'' the prostrate east, flooding it with inferior ''Western goods.''         Edith Handelsman grew up on Hoe Avenue in the Bronx and graduated in 1937 from New College, a division of Teachers College at Columbia University. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a brother, John Bernard Handelsman of Hampton Bays, N.Y., a cartoonist at The New Yorker, and a grandson.         Besides her memoir, Ms. Anderson also wrote ''Gelbes Licht'' (''Yellow Light'') in 1956 about her railroad work, and short stories, children's books and radio plays. A play, ''Wo Ist Katalin? (''Where Is Katalin?''), was produced in Weimar in 1977. From 1960 to 1977 she was the Berlin correspondent for The New York National Guardian.         Mr. Handelsman said that on her recent book-promotion visit to New York, his sister seemed confused and forgetful, possibly presaging her fatal stroke.         But Ms. Anderson's literary agent, Malaga Baldi of Manhattan, said any infirmities disappeared at a reading the author gave at the New School for Social Research on March 25.         ''She started to read an excerpt,'' Ms. Baldi said, ''but the people would not let her stop.''       
         Lois Borwick Herman Rivkin, the founder and president of an organization linking business organizations and cultural institutions to New York City public schools, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 69.         Mrs. Rivkin had lymphoma for the last six and a half years, her husband, Donald H. Rivkin, said. Though she had undergone eight courses of painful chemotherapy, she continued her work for the organization, Friends of the Public Schools, until early this year.         Rudy Crew, the New York City Schools Chancellor, noted that during her illness, she displayed the same energy she had shown in 1988 when she founded the organization that sought to introduce public school students to the city's cultural and business communities and vice versa. ''After each hospitalization, she would reappear regularly in my office and in so many classrooms that indeed, she seemed to be everywhere,'' said Dr. Crew. ''Children were Lois Rivkin's reason to live.''         The idea for Friends of the Public Schools grew out of volunteer work Mrs. Rivkin did in promoting the city's lesser-known cultural attractions during the Statue of Liberty centennial in 1986. At that time she organized a group called the View From the Torch, which produced maps and treasure hunts to spotlight hundreds of museums, libraries, parks and cultural sites in all five boroughs.         Though she was born in Denver and attended Goucher College in Baltimore, she arrived in New York in 1952 to work for the Carnegie Endowment for Peace and very quickly became what her husband described as ''the most passionate of New Yorkers.'' Her involvement with the View From the Torch project convinced her that there was very little interaction between business and arts communities and the public schools. She committed herself to establishing such ties, certain that they would enrich the entire city.         Among its initiatives, Friends of the Public Schools has organized an annual display of art by public school students at Sotheby's. It has arranged to have student chefs cater corporate conferences and civic observances and for students to present choral and instrumental concerts throughout the city.         Mrs. Rivkin was also a founder of the National Museum of Women in the Arts, and in 1976 she served as the coordinator of volunteers at the Democratic National Convention in New York City.         In addition to her husband of 45 years, she is survived by two sons, David of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Daniel of Paris; a daughter, Judith Davison of New York; a brother, Harry H. Herman of Washington, and seven grandchildren.         She had received a number of honors including citations from the city and the Board of Education. On Feb. 16, the Citizens Committee for New York City presented her with a special New Yorker for New York Award. Some 1,200 people turned out that night, and one of the attendees  noted how vital Mrs. Rivkin appeared despite her illness. ''She even danced,'' he said.       
         Felicia Gizycka Magruder, an American heiress who was kidnapped as a child by her father, a continental count, died on Feb. 26 at the Regency retirement community in Laramie, Wyo. She was 93 and moved to Laramie from New Canaan, Conn., in 1995.         Mrs. Magruder was the former Countess Felicia Gizycka, the only daughter of the Chicago-born newspaper heiress Eleanor Medill Patterson and Count Josef Gizycki, a fortune-hunting scion of a noble Polish family. Ms. Patterson, who eventually divorced the count, was a granddaughter of Joseph Medill, the founder of The Chicago Tribune.         The little Countess Felicia, as the newspapers later called her, was born in 1905 in Blansko in what is now the Czech Republic.         In 1908, when Felicia was a golden-haired, blue-eyed toddler, The New York Times reported that she had been ''kidnapped in London by the Count,'' who ''is thought to be either in Vienna or St. Petersburg and has concealed the child.'' The Times said that earlier ''the Countess ran away from him with her child one night after a violent quarrel.''         The ensuing custody struggle led President-elect William Howard Taft to intervene with Czar Nicholas II of Russia, in whose realm the Gizycki family estates were located. In December 1908, Taft wrote the Czar pointing out Felicia's mother's connection to Russia and saying that the count had put the kidnapped toddler in a convent in Russia. Taft asked the Czar to ''make such order to Count Gizycki as shall seem to Your Majesty equitable.''         The Czar commanded the count to return Felicia to her mother, and when that happened, as one Patterson biographer has written, ''they caught the first train for Germany and from there took the first steamship to America.''         Lake Forest, Ill. became their home. Mrs. Magruder's mother also bought a ranch in Wyoming, and there, as The Laramie Daily Boomerang reported in its obituary of Mrs. Magruder, an able young journalist named Drew Pearson ''came out to court Felicia.''         But things did not go smoothly, and the teen-age countess ''caught a train to San Diego, where she took an assumed name and supported herself as a waitress.'' In a 1939 interview she said, ''I tell you, I was good'' as a waitress.         ''I could swing a mean tray,'' she added. ''I always wanted to make my own way in life -- it gives one a nice feeling.''         Undeterred, Pearson caught up with her. He is said to have made her a practical offer: ''Look, you're only 18. Marry me now and in three years, if you don't love me, you can leave and start your life all over again.'' Their marriage began in 1925, produced a daughter, Ellen, and was ended in divorce by Mrs. Pearson after three years.         But what years they were, with the promising Pearson, who was not yet the mighty syndicated columnist he later became, taking his young wife  to China and beyond, while he polished his journalistic skills.         In later years she wrote for American magazines and newspapers, lived in New York and elsewhere, and wrote novels and short stories.  In her 1939 novel ''Flower of Smoke,'' the Austrian-American heroine says, ''Make your own peace, no matter what.''         After living for years in New Canaan she moved for good to Wyoming, where she had relatives.         Her 1934 marriage to an Englishman, Dudley de Lavigne, ended in divorce. Her 1958 marriage to John Kennedy Magruder, a landscape architect and a director of the Alcoholics Anonymous Men's Home in Alexandria, Va., also ended in divorce.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen Pearson Arnold of San Diego; three grandsons, Joe and Drew Arnold of Laramie and George Arnold of Evanston, Wyo.; a granddaughter, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Lucille Lortel, whose pioneering efforts to bring innovative theater and adventurous new playwrights and actors to the American stage earned her the title Queen of Off Broadway, died on Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 and had homes in Manhattan and Westport, Conn.         Among the legacies of Miss Lortel's cutting-edge career, which spanned more than 70 years, is the theater that bears her name in Greenwich Village; the still thriving White Barn Theater that she started in Westport in 1947; the Lucille Lortel Room at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center, and the funds and fellowships she established to aid the arts. She also leaves a veritable Who's Who of people in international theater -- playwrights, actors, directors, composers and designers -- whose careers were advanced by her daring and her confidence in young talent.         ''If you love the theater you must be innovative,'' she once said. ''You must try new ideas and new faces. That's the only way theater can develop. You can't do it on Broadway because it costs too much. The costs are lower Off Broadway, so you can afford to take a chance, and you must take a chance.''         Forsaking the Footlights For a Backstage Role         Miss Lortel gave up a career as an actress in 1939 in deference to her wealthy husband's wishes and in 1947 began an experimental summer theater for American and foreign plays and playwrights in the barn of the couple's summer estate in Westport. From the start she wanted White Barn, as she called it, to be a sanctuary from commercial pressures, a place where writers could take a chance with their plays and where actors could stretch their talents. It was there that Miss Lortel staged readings, mothered performers like Eva Marie Saint, Geoffrey Holder and Zero Mostel and presented plays by Samuel Beckett, Edward Albee, Eugene Ionesco and Sean O'Casey.         In 1955 her husband, Louis Schweitzer, gave her a Manhattan theater, now known as the Lucille Lortel Theater, as a 24th wedding anniversary gift. The first production in the house, at 121 Christopher Street, then called the Theater de Lys, was Marc Blitzstein's adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's and Kurt Weill's ''Threepenny Opera. '' It caused such a sensation that the production ran for seven years and put Off Broadway on the map.         As Stuart W. Little observed in his 1972 book ''Off Broadway: The Prophetic Theater'': ''For thousands of theatergoers, a visit to the de Lys was the authentic Off Broadway experience. Off Broadway meant the discovery of new talent and fresh theatrical experiences in unfamiliar parts of the city. . . .The de Lys at the far end of Christopher Street, near the Hudson River docks, was situated in a borderline neighborhood between the known residential part of the city and the open seaport. The unknown world beyond, in imagination, merged with the pulsing underworld life of 'The Threepenny Opera' and became sinister, exotic, menacing.''         Miss Lortel was frustrated by the success of ''Threepenny Opera'' because she wanted to bring more plays into her theater, so she  persuaded the American National Theater and Academy to support a matinee series as a ''laboratory for innovation.'' The series ran for 20 years and became a legend. A verse adaptation of Alan Paton's novel ''Cry the Beloved Country'' became the first venture of the series in 1956, followed that  season by such groundbreaking productions as Anna Sokolow's Kafkaesque dance-drama ''Metamorphosis'' and May O'Donnell's modern-dance interpretation of Maeterlinck's play ''Pelleas and Melisandre.''         Over the years the series offered ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' a dramatization of Langston Hughes poems with Godfrey Cambridge; adaptations of poetic works by Robert Frost, Archibald MacLeish, W. H. Auden and Conrad Aiken; performances of rarely seen plays by O'Casey, Ionesco, Tennessee Williams, Albee and William Inge, and presented actors like Richard Burton in ''An Afternoon of Poetry,'' Siobhan McKenna as Hamlet, Helen Hayes in an anthology of Shakespeare and Dame Sybil Thorndike and Sir Lewis Casson in a joint dramatic reading. Terrence McNally and Adrienne Kennedy were among the new writers whose works were presented.         She brought Jean Genet to the attention of American audiences with a production of ''The Balcony,'' which she co-produced at Circle in the Square in 1960. She also oversaw the first American production of a play by Athol Fugard, the South African playwright; it was ''Blood Knot,'' starring James Earl Jones and J. D. Cannon, and it ignited audiences at the Cricket Theater on Second Avenue in 1964. She introduced many plays by Beckett, including ''Rockaby,'' on Theater Row on West 42d Street.         Creating a Setting For Cutting-Edge Work         At the Theater de Lys, she provided a home for such plays as David Mamet's ''A Life in the Theater,'' Sam Shepard's ''Buried Child'' and ''Getting Out,'' early work by Marsha Norman, Caryl Churchill's ''Cloud Nine'' and Wendy Wasserstein's ''Isn't It Romantic.'' The house was renamed the Lucille Lortel Theater in 1981, and has been the setting for Larry Kramer's ''The Destiny of Me,'' for ''Groucho'' and for ''Gertrude Stein and a Companion,'' the recipient of the National Education Film and Video Award for historical biographies.         The 38th volume of John Willis's ''Theater World'' (1981-82) is dedicated ''To Lucille Lortel, whose vibrant spirit and untiring efforts have made immeasurable contributions to all components of the theater by discovering and encouraging new talent, and whose devotion to Off Broadway provided the impetus for its proliferation.''         In 1960 Miss Lortel began sponsoring dramatic productions and seminars at the Library of Congress. The presentations included O'Casey's ''Time to Go,'' Mark Van Doren's ''Last Days of Lincoln'' and Albee's ''Fam and Yam.''         Miss Lortel produced or co-produced some 500 plays, 5 of which were nominated for Tony Awards -- ''As Is'' by William M. Hoffman, ''Angels Fall'' by Lanford Wilson, ''Blood Knot'' by Mr. Fugard, ''Sarafina!,'' an import from South Africa, and ''A Walk in the Woods'' by Lee Blessing. Several were produced in Broadway theaters and the others moved to Broadway.         The theater on Christopher Street was only one of many unusual gifts that Mr. Schweitzer lavished on Miss Lortel before his death in 1971. A chemical engineer who made his fortune manufacturing cigarette papers, he also owned the FM radio station WBAI.         In 1957, when his wife told him it was sometimes difficult to find a cab after the theater, he bought a gray Mercedes-Benz. He had been told there was a cab driver named Louis Schweitzer in town and he arranged to get a taxi medallion for the car and for his namesake to act as its part-time driver. When the driver wasn't transporting  Miss Lortel, he was free to use the car as a taxi and split the earnings with the boss.         In 1956, Mr. Schweitzer was the first foreigner in more than 400 years allowed to buy a gondola in Venice. Although traditionally gondolas were identified only by numbers, he was given permission to name his purchase ''Lucille.'' The gondola continued to carry passengers and the gondolier was told that if American visitors used Mr. Schweitzer's name to book a ride, they were to be charged double. ''My friends can afford it,'' he explained.         For some years, the Schweitzers spent part of each winter on a houseboat in Florida. The two-story villa on a raft, anchored off Miami Beach, had two bedrooms, a kitchen, living room, servants' quarters and a bar sheltered by a thatched roof.         Lucille Lortel was born in Manhattan on Dec. 16, 1900, the daughter of Harry and Anna Wadler. Lucille was her given name, Lortel an alliterative concoction for the stage. Her father was a manufacturer of women's clothes and frequently traveled to Europe to buy designs that he would copy. For some years, Miss Lortel was tutored at home and although she said, ''I think I went to public school after that,'' she did remember that she never graduated. She attended Adelphi College briefly and studied at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. A 1921 review in ''The Musical Leader'' of her  graduating class's production of D'Annunzio's ''Honeysuckle'' described her as ''an exquisite little creature who seemed to be inspired.'' Later, she studied briefly with Max Reinhardt in Berlin.         Miss Lortel made her Broadway debut in 1925 in the Theater Guild production of George Bernard Shaw's ''Caesar and Cleopatra'' with Helen Hayes as Cleopatra and Lionel Atwill as Caesar. She had a small role, which she said had been added by the director, playing what she described as a whore. She never forgot her unwhorelike lines: ''No no, no, I'll have nothing to do with you,'' addressed to the line of men following her.         She met Mr. Schweitzer in 1930. ''I wasn't interested in getting married,'' she recalled. ''I was involved in the theater.'' Mr. Schweitzer pursued her. During a business trip to France he telephoned and told her he was sending a ticket and that they would get married in Paris. Friends persuaded her to accept -- ''You can always get a divorce,'' they said.         When she arrived in March 1931, the couple discovered that official proclamations of their intended marriage had to be posted for several weeks before the marriage could take place. They sailed back to the United States on the Leviathan and were married by the captain. ''I wouldn't have anything to do with my husband until we came back to New York,'' she said, and even then she waited for two more ceremonies,  one at City Hall and a religious service in Manhattan performed by the Jewish chaplain at West Point.         The year after her marriage, Miss Lortel appeared on stage with Jean Arthur and Claude Rains in ''The Man Who Reclaimed His Head,'' but her husband objected to her absence in the evenings. His unhappiness led to a new activity that continued until 1939 -- acting in movie shorts filmed in Brooklyn in the afternoons. This was followed by a temporary retirement.         ''My husband's mother disapproved of acting, and he was very possessive,'' Miss Lortel said in a 1996 interview. ''After a while, I was getting bored. I thought I'd go nuts so I started readings at Westport, moving the tractors and Ping-Pong table from the barn.''         From a White Barn To Off Broadway         In 1947 Miss Lortel was approached by the actor Canada Lee and Philip Huston, a playwright, who needed a place and a distinguished audience for a staged reading of a new play called ''The Painted Wagon.'' Miss Lortel provided both. This was followed by a request from the agent Audrey Wood, who wanted a showcase for a musical, ''No Casting Today.'' Thus the White Barn was opened with Miss Lortel as its sole backer and hostess, providing room and board for the actors.         She had a permanent stage built, brought in new and innovative troupes like the Dublin Players Company, the Oxford University Players and Mr. Holder and his Trinidad Dance Troupe, established an apprentice school, introduced seminars in Shakespeare, Ibsen and Chekhov, and offered playwrights, actors, designers, composers and directors a chance to spread their wings.         ''When the White Barn began, it was to summer theater what Off Broadway is to the commercial theater,'' the actress and producer Eva Le Gallienneonce said. ''An avowed pioneer, it proved that summer productions could be stimulating, avant-garde and enthusiastically received.''         Nurturing Newcomers And Seasoned Actors         Among the newcomers who got a chance at the White Barn were Peter Falk, Vincent Gardenia, Sada Thompson, George Peppard and Sidney Lumet. Working with them were more established actors seeking challenges  -- Mildred Dunnock, Mr. Mostel, Kim Hunter, James Coco and Peggy Wood.         Mr. Schweitzer initially enjoyed his wife's new enthusiasm and the idea of having actors around the estate in the summer. Later, his enthusiasm waned and although he continued to support her endeavors, it wasn't until his later years that his interest revived.         Miss Lortel was showered with virtually every theatrical award and honor except a Tony, which is given for achievement on Broadway. She received the first Margo Jones Award (1962) and the Lee Strasberg Lifetime Achievement Award (1985), as well as induction into the Theater Hall of Fame (1990) and recognition from the School of the Arts at Columbia University (1996). The first theater chair to be named for a woman bears her name, the Lucille Lortel Distinguished Professorial Chair in Theater at the City University of New York. A permanent tribute to her career is on display at the archives of the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts. The Lucille Lortel Theater Collection, an archive of theatrical history and memorabilia, is on permanent exhibition at the Westport Public Library.         In 1986, the Lucille Lortel Awards were established by the League of Off Broadway Theaters and Producers to honor outstanding achievements in the Off Broadway theater. Recipients have included the playwright A. R. Gurney, for ''The Cocktail Hour''; John Tillinger, the director; Playwrights Horizons, and Lincoln Center Theater for ''Woza Afrika!''         Miss Lortel, who leaves no immediate survivors, was a generous donor in other theatrical areas. She established the Lucille Lortel Fund for New Drama at Yale University to support the production of new plays at the Yale Repertory Theater (the fund's premiere production was August Wilson's ''Fences''). The Lucille Lortel Fellowship in Playwriting was started at Brown University in Providence, R.I., in 1996. She also donated money for the annual Drama Circle awards and made sizable financial contributions to dance and music groups.         ''Honey, I've got a one-track mind and it's theater, theater, theater,'' she once said. ''I have no time for anything else.''         One of Miss Lortel's favorite possessions in her memento-filled midtown apartment at the Sherry-Netherland Hotel, where she lived after her husband's death, was a box covered with notices of plays she had produced. The lid opened to the sound of applause and a voice calling out ''More! More!''         Circulating in a milieu where youth often takes the starring role, she frequently sidestepped the matter of age by saying ''age is a number and mine is unlisted.'' When a gossip column last year reported that Miss Lortel would soon celebrate her 98th birthday, Blanche Marvin, a friend, reported that she was furious.         ''This will kill my love life,'' she said.       
         Gladys Hasty Carroll, a novelist who wrote about the rural Maine of her childhood, died last Thursday at a hospital in York, Me. She was 94 and lived in South Berwick, Me.         Ms. Carroll earned a Pulitzer Prize nomination for her 1933 work, ''As the Earth Turns,'' the story of a long-established farm family in southern Maine and the Polish immigrants who buy neighboring land. A best seller, the book was turned into a movie by Warner Brothers the following year. In 1935, Ms. Carroll adapted it into a folk play, which was performed annually in South Berwick for more than a decade. She wrote of the experience in ''The Book That Came Alive,'' her last.         Born in Rochester, N.H., Ms. Carroll grew up in, and later returned to, the farmhouse her grandfather built during the Civil War in Dunnybrook, a hamlet on the outskirts of South Berwick. A day after graduating from Bates College, she married Herbert A. Carroll and started writing for children's magazines before  quickly producing three novels, ''As the Earth Turns,'' ''A Few Foolish Ones'' and ''Neighbor to the Sky.''         Ms. Carroll wrote a total of 23 other works, including ''Dunnybrook,'' a social history of 10 generations of farmers in her community.         She is survived by a son, Warren,  of Manassas, Va.; a daughter, Sarah Carroll Watson of South Berwick; two grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Jane Rathbun, who became known as the grandmotherly Brownie Mary who handed out brownies laced with high-grade marijuana to sick people to relieve their pain and nausea, died on Saturday at a hospital in San Francisco. She was 77 and lived in San Francisco.         Ms. Rathbun campaigned on the local, state and national level to legalize marijuana for medicinal purposes. She baked the brownies in the small kitchen of her home in a housing project for the elderly in the largely gay Castro neighborhood of San Francisco. She called them ''original recipe brownies'' and ''magically delicious.'' In one raid on her home in 1981, the police confiscated 54 dozen of them, along with more than 18 pounds of the marijuana, donated by growers.         Ms. Rathbun was arrested three times and was ordered to perform hundreds of hours of community service, which she spent with AIDS patients. Her base of operations in the early years of the AIDS epidemic was San Francisco General Hospital. Working as a volunteer for some 10 years, she devoted untold hours to help care for ''her kids,'' as the patients came to be known.         Her role as a baker was but a small part of her activities. She became a San Francisco fixture for whom the city fathers proclaimed an official Brownie Mary Day in 1992 to honor her work with dying patients in the AIDS ward.         With Dennis Peron, a longtime comrade and prominent marijuana advocate, she published ''Brownie Mary's Marijuana Cookbook and Dennis Peron's Recipe for Social Change,'' which did not include the brownie recipe. They also founded the San Francisco Cannabis Buyers Club, which is now defunct.         Her first arrest on marijuana charges and a judge's order to perform community service prompted Ms. Rathbun to join the Shanti project, one of the first AIDS support groups. The court action led to ''Free Brownie Mary'' groups, but two more arrests for marijuana possession went unprosecuted.         Mary Jane Rathbun was born in Minnesota and grew up in Chicago.  She settled in San Francisco in World War II, briefly married and had a daughter who died in a car accident. There are no immediate survivors.         By the mid-1990's, Ms. Rathbun could no longer bake because of arthritis and other ailments that kept her in constant pain. She had two artificial knees and, she said, only her own sweet medicine enabled her to walk at all.         Her campaigns and arrests helped build support for the 1996 California State initiative that made the use of marijuana conditionally legal. The measure allowed use with a doctor's consent for patients suffering from AIDS, cancer and certain other serious conditions whose symptoms are said to be alleviated by the drug.         But the law has led to numerous skirmishes between advocates of marijuana and local and the Federal authorities who say that a voter initiative cannot override a Federal ban on marijuana.       
         Mary Lutyens, a well-born English  biographer and novelist who was applauded by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, died on April 9 in London. She was 90 and lived in London and the English county of Dorset.         Miss Lutyens (pronounced LUTCH-ens) was a daughter of Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens (1869-1944), the British architect who planned New Delhi and many of its Government buildings, including the Viceroy's palace. Her mother was Lady Emily Lutyens, daughter of the First Earl of Lytton, a poet and a Viceroy of India.         Not surprisingly, Mary Lutyens was worldly as well as literary. In London, The Independent noted,  ''She was famous for her dry martinis and her elegance and, although unmusical, danced alone to Cole Porter for exercise.'' As a writer, she won praise for the accuracy and readability of her biographies, which included ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (1968). Sir John Everett Millais (1829-96) was a handsome British painter and a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite movement in Britain. John Ruskin (1819-1900) was a British social theorist and critic whose wife, Effie, fell in love with Millais.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Carolyn G. Heilbrun noted: ''Mary Lutyens has now restored to England the Davis Cup for the editing of Victorian letters -- a trophy long in American hands. In 'Millais and the Ruskins,' combining exemplary scholarship with editing that is at once tactful and informative, she uses many previously unpublished letters by eminent Victorians to tell a passionate and moving story. Her book will be equally valuable to the Victorian scholar and to what used to be called the general reader.''         Miss Lutyens was the editor of a related book-length collection of letters, ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice,'' which was described in The Times Book Review by another critic, Joan Evans, as ''admirably and discreetly edited.''         Miss Lutyens also wrote several authoritative books about the Indian spiritual philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurt (1895-1986). They include ''Krishnamurti: The Open Door'' (1991).         Her more than a dozen works of fiction include ''Cleo'' (1974), which Martin Levin in The Times Book Review called a ''flawless tour de force.''         She also wrote fiction under the pseudonym Esther Wyndham.         Miss Lutyens was born in London and educated privately before attending Queens College, London. She  became a writer in her early 20's.         She married Anthony Sewell in 1930 and the couple were divorced in 1945. Later that year she married J. G. Links, an art expert known as Joe, who died in 1997.         She is survived by a daughter from her first marriage, Amanda.       
         Adele Woodhouse Erb Sullivan, who was president general of the National Society Daughters of the American Revolution in the 1960's, died on April 22 in Wilton, Conn., at the home of her daughter, Nancy E. Thorne. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Scarsdale, N.Y.         Mrs. Sullivan was probably best known for her well-publicized trip to Vietnam, at the invitation of Gen. William C. Westmoreland, in 1968. At one point during her tour, two American soldiers spied her getting out of a helicopter in a central highlands combat zone. ''Look, Mom is coming up the hill,'' one of the soldiers was reported to have quipped.         ''That trip to Vietnam meant a great deal to the national society,'' said Sarah King of Murfreesboro, Tenn., who was president general of the D.A.R. from 1983 until 1986. ''Membership grew to 188,000 because of her special leadership and knowledge of public relations.''         The organization's membership peaked at about 212,000 in the mid-1980's, and is now about 175,000, according to Mrs. King. ''We will never again have a leader like her,'' she said. ''She was dynamic, articulate and interested in everything in American life.''         Adele Woodhouse, who was born in Trenton, was a descendant of early Colonial Pennsylvania settlers. The direct lineal ancestor who gave her entry into the Daughters of the American Revolution was Israel Matson of Philadelphia. She was educated in Quaker schools and at Rider College.         She joined the D.A.R. in 1930, and during World War II, she was a leader in the organization's war work, maintaining a service booth in the Roosevelt Hotel in Manhattan for the armed forces.         In 1953, she became a state regent, directing 177 D.A.R. chapters with 15,000 members.         In 1956, she was elected recording secretary general of the national society, and in 1959, she was elected first vice president general. She was elected president general in 1965, serving one term until 1968, when she was made an honorary president general for life.         Her first husband, Harold E. Erb of Garden City, N.Y., died in 1957, and her second husband, William H. Sullivan Jr. of Scarsdale, died in 1985.         Besides her daughter, Mrs. Sullivan is survived by two granddaughters and two great-grandchildren.       
         Ruth Moulton Gilbert, a practicing psychoanalyst in Manhattan for over 40 years, died on April 30 at her home in Clinton Corners, N.Y. She was 83.         The cause was complications from cancer, her family said.         Dr. Moulton, who was known professionally by her maiden name, was a supervising and training analyst and fellow emeritus at the William Alanson White Institute of Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis and Psychology. She served as the institute's director of training from 1960 to 1970. She also was an assistant clinical professor of psychiatry at Columbia University and associate attending psychiatrist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute from the 1950's until 1980.         She took a professional interest in the way theories of female sexuality had changed since the days of Freud. She published many papers on related topics, including feminism, frigidity, the changing family structure and the roles of men and women.         Ruth Moulton was born in Columbia, Mo., and graduated from the University of Chicago in 1936 and from its medical school three years later. She trained in psychiatry under Drs. Erich Fromm, Harry Stack Sullivan and Frieda Fromm-Reichmann and graduated from the New York Branch of the Washington School of Psychiatry in 1946.         Dr. Moulton's husband, Dr. Louis J. Gilbert, died in 1989. She is survived by their daughter, Karen Gilbert of Brentwood, Calif.; two sons from an earlier marriage, Dr. David Flory of Manhattan and Dr. Christopher Flory of Williamsburg, Mass., and four grandchildren.       
         Madelaine Chambers, a lyric soprano who sang at the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera in the 1950's and 60's, died on April 30 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. She was 72 and lived in Allentown, N.J.         The cause was leukemia, said Leyna Gabriele, a friend.         Ms. Chambers attended New York University, Teachers College at Columbia University and the Juilliard School. She also won a Fulbright Award for vocal studies in Italy. She made her professional debut in the early 1950's as Musetta in Puccini's ''Boheme'' at the Teatro Nuovo in Milan. She also won several competitions, including the international contest for opera singers in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Marian Anderson Scholarship Fund Auditions in New York.         Ms. Chambers made her New York City Opera debut as Micaela in Bizet's ''Carmen'' in 1954; the next  evening she sang Zerlina in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni.'' In 1955 she was a winner of the Metropolitan Opera's Auditions of the Air and was signed to the company's roster in 1956. At the Met she appeared in Verdi's ''Forza del Destino,'' Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' and Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro.''         After her retirement Ms. Chambers taught voice at Princeton University and the State University of New York at Purchase.         She is survived by her husband, Alex Herenchak; a daughter, Valerie, and a son, Gregory, all of Allentown, and a stepdaughter, Linda, of Stroudsburg, Pa.       
         Sheila Gruson, an artist who worked as an assistant director  with many opera companies around the world, died yesterday in Tiverton, in Devon, England. She was 48.         The cause was breast cancer, according to her brother, Lindsey.         Ms. Gruson, who lived in Tiverton, was an assistant director with Covent Garden in London and La Fenice in Venice, as well as with opera companies in New York, Hamburg, San Francisco, Seattle and Munich.         Her sculptures were exhibited in England.         Ms. Gruson was born on March 21, 1951, in Tel Aviv, and graduated from Harvard University in 1972. She was a daughter of Sydney Gruson, a former vice chairman of The New York Times Company, who died last year.         Besides her brother, of Kent, Conn., she is survived by her daughter, Nina Lourie, of Tiverton; her mother, Flora Lewis, of Paris, foreign affairs columnist for The International Herald Tribune, and a sister, Kerry Gruson of Miami.       
         Betty Robinson Schwartz, who in 1928 as a 16-year-old high school junior became the first woman to win an Olympic gold medal in track and field, died Tuesday in Colorado. She was 87.         Her son, Richard Schwartz Jr. of Denver, told The Chicago Tribune she had suffered from cancer and Alzheimer's disease in recent years.         Robinson's life story -- which included prodigious athletic glory, a life-threatening accident and an amazing Olympic comeback -- sounded like the product of an overimaginative screenwriter.         Elizabeth (Babe) Robinson was born Aug. 23, 1911, in Riverdale, Ill., a small town south of Chicago. Her career started when a high school teacher and assistant track coach in Harvey, Ill., saw her running for a commuter train (the legend is that she caught it). She later ran 50 yards for him in a school corridor, and a track career began.         These were the nascent days of organized women's track and field at the national level. As she told The Los Angeles Times in 1984: ''I had no idea that women even ran then. I grew up a hick. That is when I found out that they actually had track meets for women.''         Three weeks after being discovered, Robinson made her racing debut in a regional meet and finished second to Helen Filkey, the United States record-holder at 100 meters. In her next meet, the Chicago-area Olympic trials, she equaled the world record of 12.0 seconds (the current world record is 10.49, set by Florence Griffith Joyner in 1988). In her third meet, the United States final trials in Newark, she finished second and made the Olympic team.         In 1928, the year Amelia Earhart became the first woman to fly across the Atlantic, female track and field athletes were allowed to compete in the Olympics for the first time. The 1928 Amsterdam Games would mark the fourth meet of Robinson's career, just four months after she took up the sport at age 16.         A week after qualifying for the Olympics, she and her teammates sailed to Amsterdam and worked out on a quarter-mile linoleum track laid around the ship's deck. In Amsterdam, she finished second in her trial heat and first in her semifinal and became the only American to reach the finals.         The finish was close in the finals, and the judges declared Robinson the winner over the favored Fanny Rosenfeld of Canada in an official time of 12.2. Because the 100-meter race was the first of five women's track and field events at the 1928 Games, Robinson had won the first gold medal handed out in her sport.         ''When the flag went up after the race,'' she said, ''I started crying like a baby.''         Rosenfeld and her Canadian teammates later defeated Robinson and the American team in the 4x100-meter relay, with the United States team taking the silver.         After Robinson won the gold, Douglas MacArthur, then the president of the American Olympic Committee, presented her with a small gold charm shaped like the world. When she returned home, she was honored by ticker-tape parades down Broadway in New York and State Street in Chicago. In her hometown, she received a diamond watch from an adoring public and a silver cup from her high school.         She was still a world-class athlete when a biplane she was riding in with her cousin crashed near Chicago in 1931. Both survived, but Robinson spent 11 weeks in a hospital with severe head injuries and a broken leg and arm. A silver rod and pin were inserted to stabilize the leg, which was placed in a hip-to-heel cast. For four months, she was in a wheelchair or on crutches, and the leg became a half-inch shorter.         ''If I had not been in such good physical condition,'' she said, ''I would not have lived through it.''         As it was, she was out of competition for three and a half years. When she tried a comeback in 1936, she could not bend a knee, so she had to make a standing rather than a crouching start in the 100 meters. Still, she made the Olympic relay team, along with Harriet Bland, Annette Rogers and Helen Stephens. This time in Berlin, the American team -- with Robinson running the third leg -- captured the gold when a member of the record-setting German team fumbled the baton pass before the last handoff. Robinson had completed an improbable comeback.         In 1939, she married Richard S. Schwartz, who owned an upholstery firm. They had two children.         Besides her son, she is survived by her daughter, Jane Hamilton of Denver, and three grandchildren.         Her career included world records at 50, 60, 70 and 100 yards. She was inducted into the National Track and Field, the United States Track and Field and the Helms Halls of Fame. After she stopped running, she was a coach, timer and public speaker.         She never received the publicity and public adulation of such American successors as Babe Didrikson, Wilma Rudolph and Griffith Joyner. Years after her Olympic triumphs, she said: ''I suppose most Americans don't even recognize me. It happened so long ago I still can't believe the attention I get for something I did so long ago.''       
         Vanessa Brown, who originated the role of the girl upstairs in the Broadway production of ''The Seven Year Itch,'' a role played in the film version by Marilyn Monroe, died on Friday at the Motion Picture Country Home in Los Angeles, Calif. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, her son, David, said.         Born Smylla Brind in Vienna, Ms. Brown was blessed with beauty and  an I.Q. of 165 that she said made her feel ''squirmy.'' Her family fled the Nazis when she was 9, moving first to France and then to New York, where she came to the attention of the Broadway producer Herman Shumlin. He offered her the role of a 10-year-old Viennese girl in his production of Lillian Hellman's play ''Watch on the Rhine.'' Her parents refused to allow her to leave school, so she understudied Ann Blyth but later stepped into the role.         While in Chicago with the play, she was a guest on the radio show ''Quiz Kids,'' and did so well that she was offered and accepted a regular spot on the panel. After two years, she returned to New York, then moved to Los Angeles, where she made her first movie, ''Youth Runs Wild'' (1944), at age 16. While in college  she signed up with 20th Century Fox, and appeared in such movies as ''Tarzan and the Slave Girl'' (1950), in which she swung from trees with Lex Barker; ''The Heiress,'' and ''The Ghost and Mrs. Muir.''         Ms. Brown returned to Broadway in 1952. Her stage career included the tour of ''As You Like It'' with Katharine Hepburn.         In later years Ms. Brown turned to politics and writing. She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic Convention and was active in the Presidential campaigns of Adlai Stevenson and John F. Kennedy. As a freelance correspondent for the Voice of America, she covered topics including  politics, science and medicine.         She is survived by her son, David, and a daughter, Cathy, both of Los Angeles.       
         Beverly Lewis, a vice president and senior editor at Bantam Books,  died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 51 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Lewis died on the way to a hospital after collapsing on a Manhattan street, her husband, Sandy Eames, said. The family is awaiting results of an autopsy.         Ms. Lewis had been named a vice president on May 18. As one of the firm's senior editors, she developed works by established novelists, including Jonathan Kellerman, Dean Koontz and Michael Palmer, and occasional celebrity authors like Patty Duke, Ali McGraw, Twyla Tharp and Gen. Norman H. Schwarzkopf. She had recently begun work on the much-anticipated autobiography of John Glenn, the former senator and astronaut, to be published this fall.         In a memo to his colleagues today, in which he had intended to announce Ms. Lewis's recent appointment, Irwyn Applebaum, the president and publisher of Bantam Books, said, ''She had the sharp eye to know when her writers could do better'' and, he added, ''she had the unwavering resolve and confidence to motivate and inspire her writers to reach down and indeed improve their work.''         A native of Arkansas, Ms. Lewis graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Sweetbriar College in Virginia. She worked as an editor at Pocket Books, Dell Publishing and Harcourt Brace before joining Bantam Books in 1986 as a consulting editor. She was promoted to senior editor in 1991.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Alex, and a daughter, Elizabeth, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Clayton Lewis of Luxembourg.       
         Ruth Gilbert, a retired editor at New York magazine and The New York Herald Tribune, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.         Ms. Gilbert was best known as the editor of her own page in New York magazine listing what she felt was stylish in the city at the moment.         She spent 24 years at New York magazine, retiring in 1992, and was an editor on the magazine when it was an insert in The Herald Tribune.         Ms. Gilbert is survived by a daughter, Gwynne Wolin of Stamford, Conn., and Coconut Creek, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Ellen Sparry Brush, an anthropologist and expert in the archeology of western coastal Guerrero state in Mexico, died May 1 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 65 and also lived on Shelter Island, N.Y.         The cause was a lung disorder, her family said.         Dr. Brush contributed to the field of early Mesoamerican archeology, concentrating on pre-Columbian figurines. She and her husband and colleague, Dr. Charles F. Brush 3d, surveyed coastal Guerrero for the American Museum of Natural History.         They turned up some of the earliest evidence of alloyed bronze production on Mexico's west coast. They also unearthed pottery dating to the third millennium B.C., and identified and analyzed early pre-Columbian ceramics.         Dr. Ellen Brush was a past chairwoman of the Society of Women Geographers. She was one of the first women to be members of the Explorers Club in New York, which honored her this year.         She was born in Manhattan, graduated from Smith College and earned a Ph.D. in anthropology at Columbia University in 1965.         In addition to her husband, survivors include a daughter, Dr. Karen A. Brush, and a son, Charles F. 4th, both of Manhattan.       
         State Senator Wynona M. Lipman, who in 1971 became the first African-American woman to be elected to the New Jersey Senate, died Sunday at her home in Newark. She was 67.         The cause was cancer, her office said.         Senator Lipman, a Democrat who represented Newark, was the longest-serving member of the State Senate. For 27 years she championed the causes of women, minority groups, children and small businesses. One bill she sponsored that became law increased penalties for adults who patronize under-age prostitutes. Another broadened the statutes on domestic violence to protect more victims and increase services to the children of troubled families.         She sat on the Governor's Council on AIDS, the Task Force on Child Abuse and Neglect and the New Jersey Court Team on Domestic Violence.         A native of Georgia, she was educated at Talladega College, Tulane University and Columbia University, where she received a doctorate in philosophy on a Rockefeller Grant. She studied at the Sorbonne as a Fulbright scholar and taught high school. While serving in the Senate, she was also an associate professor at Essex County College.         For years she was not only the sole black but also the lone woman in a house she called a ''men's club'' some years ago. She held ranking positions on important committees, including those dealing with human services, the budget and appropriations.         Senator Lipman's survivors include her daughter, Karyne Anne Lipman of Atlanta, and a sister, Eloise Ransome of Virginia.       
         Dolores Jimenez Alcantara, a blind singer who was one of Spain's leading flamenco artists, died on June 14 in a hospital in Malaga. She was 90.         Onstage Ms. Jimenez wore dark glasses and typically performed while standing, supporting herself with one hand placed on the back of a chair. She performed publicly until the late 1980's under the stage name La Nina de la Puebla (The Girl From  the Village) and was best known for her rendition of ''Los Campanilleros'' (''The Bell Ringers''), a popular Spanish ballad about children's folkloric choirs.         The daughter of a singing barber from Seville province, Ms. Jimenez was born on July 28, 1908, in La Puebla de Cazalla, which gave rise to her nickname. She had an eye infection when very young, and improper treatment caused permanent blindness.         Ms. Jimenez began musical instruction at age 8 when her family moved to Madrid. She warmed gradually to flamenco, received her first contract at 14 and gained a following after a successful performance at a festival in Moron de la Frontera, southeast of Seville, at 20.         In 1931, she made her debut in Seville and a year later, in Madrid. She took ''Los Campanilleros'' and moved it definitively into the realm of flamenco.         A fellow flamenco singer, Manuel Torre, earlier had converted the same spirited ballad into a melancholy flamenco song. But Ms. Jimenez's version was lighter, peppery, more accessible yet still mournful. The song became her trademark, and she performed it with traveling troupes known as flamenco operas, which appeared in bullrings and theaters.         She spent decades fashioning countless other songs in a style that flamenco experts often described as dulce, or sweet. She was comfortable performing much of the flamenco repertory and its multiple forms of haunting melodies and staccato laments.         In 1934 she married a fellow singer, Lucas Soto Martin, known professionally as Luquitas de Marchena.  He died in 1965. Their five children --  two of whom, Adelfa and Pepe, are professional flamenco performers --  survive her.         Ms. Jimenez had been scheduled to receive a gold medal from King Juan Carlos I for Merit in Fine Arts. The authorities will now deliver the award to her family.       
         Patricia Kerr Ross, former director of the State University of New York's Programs in the Arts, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Albany. She was 60 and lived in Albany.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         As director of the university-wide arts programs from 1971 to 1991, Ms. Ross was instrumental in producing statewide arts festivals, workshops and exhibitions. Over the years her office provided creative assistance and support to artists and arts administrators throughout the State University system.         Ms. Ross helped bring dance to SUNY campuses by producing such festivals as the Early Years of Modern Dance (1981) and Merce Cunningham and the New Dance (1987). Dance Black America (1984) was produced with the Brooklyn Academy of Music and filmed for public television.         From 1979 to 1987 she was executive producer of a series of public television specials, ''SUNY in the Arts on Television.'' She also organized faculty and student visits to artists, actors, directors and producers, as well as the SUNY Writer's Festival of readings, discussions and workshops. In 1985 she was co-producer of ''The Educated Eye,'' an exhibition at the New York State Museum of 400 artworks from 25 SUNY campuses.         Ms. Ross, who taught arts policy at Empire State College, was also director of the Thayer Fellowship, which supported outstanding SUNY arts graduates in their first year of professional activity.         In 1989 she founded and directed what became an annual ''Come Sunday'' celebration of music and dance in Albany's historic Center Square neighborhood. The festival presented such performers as Dizzy Gillespie, Branford Marsalis and Garth Fagan as well as emerging local artists. She retired from the university in 1997.         Ms. Ross is survived by a daughter, Linda Proctor of Concord, N.H.; her companion, George Hofmann, an artist and professor at Hunter College, and two grandchildren.       
         Rose Kryzak, an outspoken lobbyist for the rights of the elderly who was once credited with getting a utility charge overturned as unfair to older people, died on Thursday at her home in Queens. She was 99.         She first came to the public's attention in 1976, when she argued at a Federal Power Commission hearing in Washington that utility companies should not be allowed to pass along to customers -- many of whom were elderly people with restricted incomes -- the cost of plants that were still under construction and not producing power.         Mrs. Kryzak, then 75, bluntly challenged the lawyers and bankers who represented the utilities. ''We cannot afford plants that most of us would not live to enjoy,'' she said.         The commission decided not to allow such charges except in hardship cases, and The New York Times attributed the decision to the ''Kryzak problem.''         Mrs. Kryzak's victory was not final. In 1987, after the name of the agency had been changed to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the utilities won the right to request rate increases that would cover up to 50 percent of the costs of plants under construction.         Mrs. Kryzak also helped organize groups of the elderly throughout New York State to lobby for a state-financed pharmaceutical plan to assist in paying for prescription drugs, worked to eliminate mandatory retirement laws and was vocal on increasing state supplements for Social Security.         Mrs. Kryzak, a member of the American Communist Party throughout her life, was one of the principal subjects interviewed for the documentary ''Seeing Red,'' shown at the New York Film Festival in 1983.         ''She held to her belief throughout her life,'' her son, Thomas, said. ''She refused to accept that there was any problem with the Soviet Union. Partly, it was patriotism for the old country. Both she and my father, who died in 1985, were born in Russia before the Revolution.         ''They considered themselves pioneers,'' he said, ''going down the road that this country should go down.''         Mrs. Kryzak, who was born on Oct. 15, 1899, was the oldest of six children. Her family immigrated to the United States in 1910. Her father, Isaac Marron, was an early member of the House Painters Union and a Socialist.         Mrs. Kryzak worked her entire adult life for an actuary until retiring in 1972.         In addition to her son, Thomas, of Fresh Meadows, Queens, she is survived by a daughter, Ann Herman of Lakeland, Fla., five grandchildren and a great-granddaughter.       
         Ruth Langer Lawrence, who as a 15-year-old Austrian Jewish swimmer refused to compete in the 1936 Olympic Games in Nazi Germany, died on May 2. Lawrence, who lived in London, was 77.         Lawrence was born and reared in Vienna and took up swimming at age 11 with the Jewish sports club Hakoah (meaning strength). At 14, she broke the Austrian records for the 100-meter and 400-meter freestyles and won the Austrian championships at those distances. Although Austrian officials were uncomfortable about choosing Jews for their Olympic team, she, Judith Deutsch and Lucie Goldner, all Jews, were about to be selected.         Anti-Semitism was strong in Austria then, and the pools where the swimmers would do their final training carried signs saying ''No entry for dogs and Jews.'' Heeding the recommendation of the World Federation of Jewish Sports Clubs, headed by Lord Melchett of Britain, the three swimmers refused to take part in the Olympics.         ''We do not boycott Olympia, but Berlin,'' they said in a statement.         The three women were immediately banned from Austrian swimming ''due to severe damage of Austrian sports'' and ''gross disrespect for the Olympic spirit.'' The names of all Jewish swimmers were removed from the Austrian record books.         After Germany annexed Austria in 1938, Lawrence escaped to Italy by dyeing her hair blonde and carrying a false baptismal certificate. In 1939, she moved to England, and that year she won the last British long-distance championship swim in the Thames.         Five weeks later, World War II began and she was evacuated from London to Bath as an ''enemy alien.'' She was later allowed to return to London, where she met John Lawrence, whom she married in 1943. She is survived by her husband, a son and a daughter.         Lawrence's photograph is included in the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum's traveling exhibition of the Nazi Olympics. The exhibition closed last week in Portland, Ore., and will reopen July 1 in San Diego. She was also interviewed for Stephen Spielberg's Holocaust archives.         Before the 1996 Atlanta Olympics, Lawrence told Reuters: ''Whenever the Games come up again, I get a heartache. It's something that stays with you for the rest of your life. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. But being Jewish, it was unthinkable to compete in the Games in Nazi Germany, where my people were being persecuted.''         In 1995, the Federation of Austrian Swimming Clubs lifted the ban imposed on her. The federation president wrote:         ''When I learned in recent weeks that athletes who refused to serve as window-dressing for the Hitler regime received a lifetime ban  . . . I blushed with anger and shame. I am deeply ashamed of the decision taken at that time.         ''You, who as an irreproachable and decent athlete, did everything you could to achieve athletic success, were already stamped by the Nuremberg Laws as a second-class person, and for renouncing athletic success in order to show solidarity with the persecuted, you were punished.         ''Those responsible today for the Federation of Austrian Swimming Clubs are glad that you survived that cruel and merciless time and humbly apologize for what our predecessors did. All of your athletic successes and achievements are hereby confirmed and recorded in the perpetual scoring tables. You, Ms. Lawrence, are an example to young people. We are proud that you are there.''       
         Constance Shacklock, an English mezzo-soprano who made more than 500 appearances at the Royal Opera House at Covent Garden between 1946 and 1956, and then undertook a second stage career in musical theater, died on Tuesday. She was 86.         Ms. Shacklock was born in Sherwood Forest, near Nottingham, and studied voice at the Royal Academy of Music in London. She made her debut at Covent Garden in a 1946 production of Purcell's ''The Fairy Queen,'' and quickly proved herself an invaluable member of the company. She was particularly renowned for her portrayal of Brangaene, in Wagner's ''Tristan und Isolde,'' a role she first sang at Covent Garden in 1948. Her performances as Amneris in Verdi's ''Aida,'' Queen Elizabeth I in Britten's ''Gloriana,'' Herodias in Strauss's ''Salome'' and Magdalene in Wagner's ''Meistersinger'' were also highly regarded.         She also made frequent concert appearances, and was known both for her rendering of the Angel's music in Elgar's ''Dream of Gerontius,'' and rousing performances of ''Rule Britannia'' and ''Jerusalem'' at the annual summer music festival called the Proms. The highlight of her career in musical theater was a six-year run as the Mother Abbess in the London production of ''The Sound of Music,'' starting in 1961.         Ms. Shacklock was a professor at the Royal Academy of Music from 1968 to 1984, and became president of the Association of Teachers of Singing in 1995. Among her awards was the Order of the British Empire, which she received in 1971.         She is survived by a daughter, Jean Tredaway.       
         Gina Berriault, an award-winning writer of short stories and novels, died on July 15 at Marin General Hospital in Greenbrae, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Sausalito, Calif.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         With her terse prose, emotional precision and deft storytelling, Ms. Berriault was often heralded as ''a writer's writer.''         Her 1996 collection of 35 short stories, ''Women in Their Beds,'' received critical acclaim and won the 1997 National Book Critics Circle Award, the PEN/Faulkner Fiction Prize and the Rae Award for the Short Story. Tobin Harshaw, reviewing it in The New York Times Book Review, wrote: ''One struggles to find a sentence that is anything less than jewel-box perfect.''         Born Arline Shandling in Long Beach, Calif., to parents who had emigrated from Latvia and Lithuania, Ms. Berriault spent much of her childhood in Los Angeles, where her father wrote and edited trade magazines. After his death when she was a teen-ager, she took over his work to help support her family.         She married John Berriault and settled in the San Francisco Bay Area, writing stories and magazine articles while raising a daughter. By the late 1950's, she had collected a bevy of awards in the short-story field, among them the Paris Review's Aga Khan fiction prize and two O. Henry awards.         Her first novel, ''The Descent,'' was published in 1960. Set in America in 1964, the story described the conflict between the Secretary for Humanity, a newly created Cabinet post, and a group of people who believed that moving to underground shelters would manifest ''prepared togetherness.''         Her second novel, ''Conference of Victims,'' about the suicide of a Congressional candidate, was published two years later, and was revised and republished in 1998 as ''Afterwards.''         Her other novels include ''The Son'' (1966), about an incestuous relationship between a mother and her son; ''The Lights of Earth'' (1984), about a woman and her married lover. She also published two other  short-story collections, ''The Mistress'' (1965) and ''The Infinite Passion of Expectation'' (1982).         Her short story ''The Stone Boy,'' which she adapted for the screen, was made into the 1984 film starring Robert Duvall and Glenn Close. She had recently completed a fable, ''The Great Petrowski,'' that was to be published with her own illustrations.         She is survived by a daughter, Julie Berriault of Mill Valley, Calif., and her companion, Leonard Gardner of Sausalito.       
         Trudi Schoop, a popular Swiss-born comic dancer who became a pioneer in the use of dance movement to treat mental illness, died on July 14 at her home in Van Nuys, Calif. She was 95.         Throughout the 1930's Miss Schoop was often called a female Charlie Chaplin because of the way she, like Chaplin, could combine merriment with pathos. But in the mid-40's she gave up performing to explore ways in which dance could serve as therapy for schizophrenic patients.         The daughter of a Zurich newspaper editor, Miss Schoop was essentially self-taught, although she did take some ballet and modern-dance lessons after she had already established herself as a performer. By the early 30's she was spending much of her time traveling with her company, and she made several American tours under the auspices of the impresario Sol Hurok.         Miss Schoop specialized in comic suites based upon the misadventures of a central figure. She played a male character who was frequently likened to Chaplin's Little Tramp in ''Fridolin on the Road.'' Reviewing its New York premiere for The New York Times in 1935, John Martin called Miss Schoop ''agreeable and clever,'' but also ''obvious and naive.'' Two years later, he was more enthusiastic about ''Blonde Marie,'' finding this depiction of an awkward but endearing servant girl notable for its ''great gusto and good humor.''         Miss Schoop remained in Switzerland throughout World War II, often performing in anti-Fascist cabaret shows. When the war ended, she resumed touring, offering a New York season in 1947. Soon thereafter she settled in the Los Angeles area and began a second career as a therapist.         Working with several California medical institutions, including Camarillo State Mental Hospital, she developed what she called ''body-ego technique,'' which used movement to help lead patients out of isolation so that they could respond to, rather than shrink from, human contact.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Barbara Raskin, author of the best-selling 1987 novel ''Hot Flashes,'' about the concerns of her generation of women, died on Friday at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. She was 63 and lived in Washington.         The cause was complications after vascular surgery, said her former husband Marcus Raskin.         Ms. Raskin won praise for ''Hot Flashes,'' which is about three middle-aged women who come together to mourn and commemorate the death of a female friend.         Cosmopolitan magazine, which called the book ''a novel so entertaining you'll be annoyed to have it end,'' also said: ''Every once in a while, a novelist comes along whose eye for detail is so precise that you wonder if she's read your private journal. Barbara Raskin is such a writer.''         West Coast Review of Books called the book ''enchanting, entrancing, ennobling, all-encompassing.''         The Los Angeles Times said Ms. Raskin made ''the menopausal hot flash a metaphor for sudden understanding of all the changes'' women of her generation experienced: ''marrying in the quiet 50's, raising kids and feeling stifled in the explosive 60's, getting divorced in the 70's, finding themselves in the 80's.''         But Judith Rascoe, reviewing the book in The New York Times Book Review, panned its female characters as ''raging narcissists'' who ''want it all.''         ''Hot Flashes'' was on the hardcover and paperback best-seller lists of The New York Times for a total of 20 weeks, and a movie version is to be filmed this fall.         In an interview, Ms. Raskin said of ''Hot Flashes'': ''I wrote the story I knew. I didn't set out to write a manifesto. I did want to articulate and define a little bit my friends, women I am part of. We had such bad deals along the way, out of sync from the beginning, missing things by five years. I didn't want us to get swept under the historical carpet and not be recognized at all.''         Her other writings included the novel ''Current Affairs'' (1990, Random House), which Linda Wertheimer, in The New York Times Book Review, called ''stylish and slangy, written in a wild and wordy prose that is engaging and catchy,'' but not as good as ''Hot Flashes.''         Ms. Raskin also wrote for numerous publications, including The New York Times, and was active in writers' groups. She was given a fiction award by the National Endowment for the Arts.         Barbara Bellman, as she was then, was born and reared in Minneapolis and received a bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota and a master's degree from the University of Chicago; she did doctoral work at Catholic University.         She was a Delta Airlines flight attendant in 1956 and 1957 and later taught English at Catholic and Georgetown Universities and other institutions in the Washington area.         Her 1957 marriage to Mr. Raskin ended in divorce, as did her 1984 marriage to Anatole Shub.         She is survived by a daughter, Erika Littlewood of Richmond; two sons, Jamin Ben, of Takoma Park, Md., and Noah A., of Vienna, Va.; seven grandchildren, and a brother, Richard Bellman of Manhattan.       
         Marguerite W. Cullman, a longtime theatrical investor who was also an author, died yesterday in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 94, and her main residence was in Purchase, N.Y.         After working as an editor of the old Stage magazine, Mrs. Cullman began investing with her husband, Howard S. Cullman, who was chairman of what was then called the Port of New York Authority and was prominent in the tobacco industry, serving on the board of Philip Morris  Inc. He died in 1972.         The couple began investing in Broadway productions in the 1930's because, as their children said yesterday, while Mrs. Cullman worked at Stage she liked to be sure that a play the magazine wrote about would not fold before the next issue appeared.         As a family story has it, Mrs. Cullman proved prescient in guessing on behalf of the magazine which plays would prove durable. When her husband learned that, he proposed that she read the scripts of forthcoming Broadway productions and he study the financial prospectuses issued by their producers.         After Mrs. Cullman left the magazine, the couple began their investing, which continued into the 1970's and brought them renown for their shrewdness and energy.         Robert Whitehead, the theatrical producer, recalled last night, ''I could see that she got a kick out of the theater and a kick out of being associated with it through investment.''         Among the hits that the Cullmans helped bring to the stage were ''Life With Father,'' ''Oklahoma!,'' ''Carousel,'' ''Brigadoon,'' ''South Pacific,'' ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Teahouse of the August Moon,'' ''Death of Salesman'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''         During the 1940's and 1950's, their children said, the couple's success rate was so high that their participation in a forthcoming show was enough to guarantee its full funding.         Marguerite Sanders, as she then was, was born and reared in Manhattan, attended Columbia University, worked as a writer and editor for the McNaught Newspaper Syndicate and contributed articles to The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker and other publications.         In addition, she wrote two books, ''Occupation Angel'' (1962), about Broadway, and ''Ninety Dozen Glasses'' (1960), about her life with Mr. Cullman in 1958, when he was the United States Commissioner for the World's Fair in Brussels.         She was also vice chairman of the Lighthouse for the Blind and served on the board of the Spence-Chapin Home for Adoption.         An early marriage was annulled. She married Mr. Cullman in 1935.         She is survived by a daughter, Marguerite P. Cullman of Severna Park, Md.; a son, Brian Henry Cullman of Manhattan; two stepsons, Hugh Cullman of Beaufort, N.C., and Paul T. Cullman of Ferndale, Wash.; 12 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren.       
         Constance Friess Holman, the first woman to become chief resident in medicine at New York Hospital, died last Friday at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Brattleboro, Vt. She was 91.         The cause was pneumonia, her daughter, Jane Clough, said.         Despite being first in her class at Cornell Medical School, she got the residency at what is now the New York Weill Cornell Center of Presbyterian Hospital only because the man originally chosen had tuberculosis.         While studying at Barnard College, she tutored and cared for the grandchildren of Adolph S. Ochs, then the publisher of The New York Times. Mr. Ochs lent her the money to attend medical school and arranged to have the debt forgiven upon his death.         She retired in 1988 after a long career practicing internal medicine in New York City.         She was divorced from her first husband, William Alexander Cooper, in 1969. Her second husband, Cranston W. Holman, died in 1993.         In addition to her daughter, Jane Clough of Paris and Pound Ridge, N.Y., she is survived by a son, Peter A. Cooper of Brattleboro, Vt., and four grandchildren.       
         Sherley Anne Williams, a daughter of migrant workers who became an award-winning novelist, poet and playwright as well as a professor at the University of California, died on July 6 at a hospital in San Diego. She was 54 and lived in San Diego.         The cause was cancer, Kate Callen, a university spokeswoman, said.         Ms. Williams fused her experiences in the dusty cotton fields and fruit orchards of the San Joaquin Valley with historical research to articulate the African-American experience.         In 1986, when she was already a celebrated poet, she ventured successfully into fiction with the historical novel ''Dessa Rose.''         A story of relationships, particularly the one between a privileged Charleston bride and a young pregnant slave sentenced to die after the birth of her baby, the work was praised by David Bradley in The New York Times as ''artistically brilliant, emotionally affecting and totally unforgettable.''         Ms. Williams's language, infused with rhythm and image, transcended the boundaries of genre.         ''While Ms. Williams shows that she can write a novel better than a lot of novelists, nowhere does she cut herself off from her poetic roots,'' wrote Mr. Bradley, citing a passage in which the character Dessa recalls her lover, Kaine:         ''Kaine, his voice high and clear as running water over a settled stream bed, swooping to her through her. . . . He walked the lane between the indifferently rowed cabins like he owned them, striding from shade into half-light as if he could halt the setting sun. . . . Talk as beautiful as his touch. . . . Kaine's eyes had been the color of lemon tea and honey. Even now against closed eyelids, she could see them.''         At her death, Ms. Williams was working on a sequel to ''Dessa Rose'' and on a novel set in the 20th century.         Her first book of verse, ''The Peacock Poems,'' was nominated for a Pulitzer Prize and a National Book Award in 1975.         She won an Emmy Award for a television performance of poems from her second book of verse, ''Some One Sweet Angel Chile,'' which was another National Book Award nominee. Her one-woman drama, ''Letters From a New England Negro,'' was performed at the National Black Theater Festival in 1991 and at the Chicago International Theater Festival in 1992.         ''Working Cotton,'' a 1992 children's tale, won an American Library Association Caldecott Award and a Coretta Scott King Book Award, and was listed among the best books of 1992 by Parents magazine. Ms. Williams had recently published a second children's book, ''Girls Together.''         Born in Bakersfield, Calif., she grew up in Fresno, where her family worked as migrant workers. Her father died when she was 8, her mother when she was 16. After that she survived by picking crops in the same fields where her parents had toiled. Her upbringing, she later said, ''was the most deprived, provincial kind of existence you can think of.''         Though an impassioned reader, Ms. Williams had been discouraged from that activity by her mother, who felt she might be introduced to ambitions she would have no possibility of fulfilling. But in the eighth grade, a science teacher saw promise and urged her to enroll in college preparatory courses. In high school, she realized a love of language and was encouraged to apply to college.         The change was unsettling, she later recounted. ''To go from having no prospects at all to having seemingly limitless opportunity . . . well, in my case, I feel I just wasn't prepared for seemingly limitless opportunity.''         As a freshman at Fresno State University, she discovered the work of Langston Hughes and Sterling Brown, who she claimed were her earliest influences. ''I was just captivated by their language, their speech and their character because I always liked the way black people talk,'' she said. ''So I wanted to work that in writing.''         After completing a master's degree in American literature at Brown University, she joined the literature department at the University of California at San Diego in 1973 and remained there until shortly before her death.         She is survived by a son, John Malcolm Stewart of Lancaster, Calif.; a sister, Ruby Birdson, and three grandchildren.       
         Joan Wight, the widow of the Yorkshire veterinarian who wrote under the name James Herriot and the model for a character in his books and television programs based on them, died on Wednesday. She was in her 80's.         Ms. Wight's health slowly declined after her husband died in 1995 at age 78, said Thomas McCormack, the former editor in chief of St. Martin's Press, which published the first five Herriot books.         Her husband, whose real name was James Alfred Wight, vividly depicted his wife as the endearing and supportive Helen Herriot in his memoirs, beginning with ''All Creatures Great and Small.'' Mr. McCormack described Ms. Wight as the model for ''the humorous, loving and, from time to time, tolerating wife of James Herriot.''         ''All Creatures Great and Small'' became the basis for a long-running television series, which was originally a BBC-TV production and later a cable television series in the United States. Its accounts of rural life attracted an audience of millions around the world.         On television, Helen was played first by Carol Drinkwater and later by Lynda Bellingham. In a 1979 movie, ''All Things Bright and Beautiful,'' Helen was portrayed by Lisa Harrow.         Although ''All Creatures Great and Small'' became a best seller, it was not reviewed until months after its publication, when strongly positive word-of-mouth reports had begun to make it famous.         One episode in the first Herriot book describes how Ms. Wight met her future husband. She grew up on a farm in Yorkshire not far from ''the surgery,'' as Mr. Wight's veterinary hospital was known.         One day, she brought in a calf with a broken leg. Mr. Wight repaired the damage with a splint. Later, she brought in a dog with a dislocated hip, and this time, he had eyes only for her. They soon became engaged.         ''A characteristic scene comes in the final chapter of 'All Creatures Great and Small,' '' Mr. McCormack said. ''The scene tells of Joan's and James's honeymoon, which is interrupted by a sudden, mad crush of work, which kills their hope of taking a trip. As Joan sits with notebook on her knee and pencil at the ready, she smiles. It was a magnificent, loving ending.''         Ms. Wight is survived by a son, James, and a daughter, Rosemary Page, both of Yorkshire in northern England.       
         Rummana Hussain, a painter and conceptual artist who was also active in Indian politics, died on July 5 at her home in Bombay. She was 47.         The cause was cancer, said the photographer Ram Rahman, a friend.         Ms. Hussain, who came from a prominent Muslim family in Bombay, was for much of her career a painter of allegorical figurative subjects. But political events in India, particularly the destruction of a mosque by Hindu militants in the city of Ayodhya in 1992 and the subsequent attacks on Muslims, spurred her into political action and changed the direction of her work.         She participated in demonstrations protesting both the Ayodhya incident and growing religious nationalism in India. She developed a photo-based feminist art that brought images of ruined architecture, land and the female body together in pointed combinations.         As an artist in residence at Art in General, an alternative space in Manhattan, she created a video-based installation last fall. Titled ''In Between,'' the video combined images of Bombay with others of South Asian immigrant life in New York and alternated shots of the artist under treatment in a Manhattan hospital with others of her walking across the Queensboro Bridge wearing the tinkling ankle bells of an Indian classical dancer.         Ms. Hussain showed widely in India and in Europe         She is survived by her husband, Ishaat, and a daughter, Shazmin.       
         Amaryllis Fleming, a British cellist who was particularly devoted to chamber music and the Baroque literature, died on Tuesday at a hospital in Nettlebed, near Oxford, England, where she lived. She was 73.         Ms. Fleming lived a colorful life, partly because she was born into a family with both pronounced creative abilities and strong social connections, but also because of her own musical abilities, which drew her into the orbits of the pianist Artur Schnabel, the violinist Joseph Szigeti, the cellists Pierre Fournier and Pablo Casals, the conductor Sir John Barbirolli and the guitarists Julian Bream and John Williams.         She made her public debut playing the Elgar Cello Concerto when she was 19, and went on to win several important prizes and competitions. She also appeared -- or at least, her arms and hands did -- in ''Connecting Rooms'' (1969), as the screen fingers of Bette Davis, who played a cellist in the film.         Ms. Fleming was born in 1925, the  daughter of the painter Augustus John and of Eve Fleming, the wife of a Maj. Valentine Fleming, Member of Parliament. Ms. Fleming had four half-brothers, the most famous of whom was Ian Fleming, the author of the James Bond spy novels. Until she was 24, Ms. Fleming believed that she was Eve Fleming's adopted daughter. Her discovery of the truth caused a rift with her mother but brought her closer to John, whose home in Wiltshire became a retreat for her.         Having taken up the cello at the age of 9, Ms. Fleming determined early that she would become a professional musician. In 1943 she enrolled at the Royal College of Music, where she studied with Ivor James. By the end of the following year she had performed on the BBC and made her concert debut. When she auditioned for Fournier at that time, he was so impressed that he offered to teach her at no charge. They soon began a romance that mellowed into a long-standing friendship. Ms. Fleming's mother, determined to separate her from Fournier, arranged for her to study first in Portugal and later with Casals in Prades, Spain.         Ms. Fleming never married, and left no immediate family.         In the early 1950's, Ms. Fleming won the Queen's Prize, in England, as well as the Munich International Competition. She gave the German premiere of the Elgar Concerto in Hamburg, with Barbirolli conducting, and performed as a member of the Loveday Trio, the Fidelio Ensemble and the Paganini Trio. Later she formed the Fleming Trio, which went through many personnel changes in the 1970's, but was one of her most highly regarded chamber music endeavors.         The most decisive influence on her career, though, was her meeting in the 1950's with E. M. W. Paul, a musicologist who introduced her to Baroque music played on period instruments. Under Paul's influence, she became one of the first cellists to become interested in incorporating musicological research into her performances of Baroque works. She began playing on both restored Stradivarius and Guarneri cellos, and on an Amati with a five-string layout that allowed her to play certain works -- including Bach's Sonatas for Viola da Gamba, and the Sixth Suite for Unaccompanied Cello -- without making the transpositions necessary on a four-string instrument.         Ms. Fleming continued to perform until 1993, when a stroke left her unable to play. But she continued to teach, an occupation to which she had devoted herself increasingly, starting in the 1970's, when she joined the faculty of the Royal College of Music. Her best-known student is the cellist Raphael Wallfisch.       
         Anita Carter, a member of country music's pioneering Carter Family and a star in her own right, died in her home in Goodlettsville, Tenn.,  near Nashville, on Thursday. She was 66.         The cause was not yet known, Lou Robin, her manager, told the Associated Press. Ms. Carter had rheumatoid arthritis for the last few years.         Ms. Carter was one of three daughters of Ezra and Maybelle Carter, who formed the country singing group the Carter Family along with her cousin, Sara, and A. P. Carter (Sara's husband and Ezra's brother).         In 1927 the Carter Family drove from their Virginia mountain home to Tennessee and during the next 16 years recorded some 250 songs, one of the most important and influential bodies of work in country and folk music.         As a child, Anita (born Ina Anita Carter in Maces Springs, Va.) hated to be separated from her mother when the Carter Family left to perform at radio stations, so she was brought along. When she was 4, she made her radio debut with a singsong child's rhyme. The performance was such a success that soon she and her sisters were regularly singing with the Carter Family on the Texas station XERA, a powerful radio broadcast set up mainly so that a quack doctor could advertise his unusual remedies for impotence.         When the Carter Family split up in 1943, Maybelle and her three daughters -- June, Helen and Anita -- formed Mother Maybelle and the Carter Singers, performing such Carter Family standards as ''Wildwood Flower,'' ''Will the Circle Be Unbroken'' and ''Keep on the Sunny Side.''         In the late 40's, Chet Atkins played guitar with them before establishing himself in Nashville. In the 50's and early 60's, the group joined the Grand Ole Opry and performed on bills with Elvis Presley and Johnny Cash, recording the hit ''Busted'' with Mr. Cash. Presley was said to have had an unrequited crush on Anita.         An accomplished stand-up bassist with a beautiful soprano voice, Anita Carter also appeared on television shows like ''The Kate Smith Evening Hour,'' where she could be seen singing with (and being wooed by) Hank Williams in one of the legendary country singer's few television appearances. Her sister June married Mr. Cash in 1968 after the family helped bring him back to stability after a period of drug abuse.         Anita Carter's first significant solo work was the 1951 single ''Bluebird,'' a duet with Hank Snow that topped the country charts along with its B-side, ''Down the Trail of Achin' Hearts.'' She also sang with another group on the side, a trio called 'Nita, Rita and Ruby. In the 60's, she recorded a hit duet with Waylon Jennings, ''I Got on You,'' and recorded singles and albums for the labels RCA, United Artists and, in the 70's, Capitol. She also appeared on records by Merle Haggard, Porter Wagoner and the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band.         Mother Maybelle and the Carter Sisters, who renamed themselves the Carter Family after A. P. died in 1960, broke up officially in 1969, though they continued to record together until near the time of Maybelle's death in 1978. Anita's sister Helen died last summer, and June recently released an intimate, homemade solo album, ''Press On.''         In addition to June Carter Cash, of Hendersonville, Tenn., Ms. Carter is survived by a daughter, Lorrie Bennett, and a son, Jay, both of Goodlettsville.       
         Nancy Guild, a film actress who starred opposite some of the leading men of the 1940's and early 50's, died on Monday at her home in East Hampton, Long Island, after a long battle with emphysema. She was 73.         Ms. Guild, whose full name was Nancy Guild Martin, was ''discovered'' in old Hollywood style when she appeared in a 1945 Life magazine picture layout about campus fashions while a student at the University of Arizona. With her bone structure and insouciance, she captured the attention of five movie studios, which offered her screen tests.         She was signed to a seven-year contract by 20th Century-Fox, during which she made her film debut as a nightclub singer in Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ''Somewhere in the Night'' (1946), starring John Hodiak. Movie ads urged viewers to ''meet that Guild girl; she rhymes with wild.''         She went on to star with George Montgomery in ''The Brasher Doubloon'' (1947), based on the Raymond Chandler thriller ''The High Window,'' and with Orson Welles in ''Black Magic'' (1949). She retired from acting in the 50's and later wrote for Architectural Digest.         Ms. Guild married the actor Charles Russell, with whom she had a daughter, Elizabeth. They divorced in 1950 and she married Ernest H. Martin, who produced Broadway hits like ''Guys and Dolls.'' Divorced from Mr. Martin in 1975, she married John Bryson, a photojournalist, in 1978. They divorced in 1995.         She is survived by three daughters, Elizabeth Martin of Boulder, Colo., and Cecilia Martin Ford and Polly Martin of New York, and three granddaughters.       
         Eva Shain, the first woman to serve as a judge at a heavyweight championship boxing match when she was assigned to the Muhammad Ali-Earnie Shavers bout at Madison Square Garden in 1977, died Thursday at Englewood (N.J.) Hospital and Medical Center. Mrs. Shain, who lived in Fort Lee, N.J., was 81.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Frank, a longtime ring announcer.         Mrs. Shain, who was among the first female judges in New York State, judged some 50 title bouts. She worked at fights in New York, New Jersey, Nevada, Canada and Europe for over a quarter of a century.         ''It wasn't the idea of being a trailblazer,'' Mrs. Shain said of her pioneering role. ''It was something I wanted to do. It was a challenge.''         Mrs. Shain, a native of Jersey City who worked as an interior decorator and bookkeeper after attending New York University, agreed reluctantly to accompany her husband to a Golden Gloves bout at Madison Square Garden one night in the late 1960's.         ''I didn't want to watch two men beating each other up in the ring,'' she recalled. ''Besides, there were never any women at the fights.''         But she remembered how she ''totally fell in love with boxing.''         ''It was such a precise science,'' she said. ''After that, I went to every fight with him.''         Mrs. Shain went on to judge amateur bouts for eight years. In July 1974, the New York State Athletic Commission named Carol Polis, the wife of a former boxer and referee, Bob Polis, as the first woman to be a professional boxing judge in the state. Mrs. Shain and Carol Castellano, whose husband, Tony, was a judge, were the next female judges, gaining their licenses in March 1975.         Mrs. Shain received word that she would judge the Ali-Shavers bout, on Sept. 29, 1977, only hours before the fight. ''I really did not expect it,'' she recalled. ''That morning I had gone to the doctor, and he told me to stay home because I had a cold.''         Ali won the bout on a unanimous decision, Mrs. Shain giving him 9 of the 15 rounds and feeling elated that she had reached the pinnacle of her calling, ''like when an opera singer sings at the Met.''         Mrs. Shain, who worked with her husband in promotions and sales at a toy company when she was not involved in boxing, remained active as a judge until last December.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Harvey Shultz, of Hackensack, N.J., and a daughter, Barbara Brocklehurst, of Franklin Lakes, N.J., both from a previous marriage; a brother, Jack Inwood, of Paramus, N.J.; a sister, Florence Schiffman, of Tamarac, Fla., and three grandchildren.         Frank Shain, the ring announcer at seven title fights for which Eva Shain was a judge, recalled that the first time they worked together, ''As I announced the judges, there was about a three-second pause -- it was so emotional I couldn't get her name out.''         Later, he said, his wife quipped, ''We're married, and he forgot my name.''         In October 1984, a tempest of sorts arose when John Branca, the chairman of the New York State Athletic Commission, announced plans to name three female judges to the Marvelous Marvin Hagler-Mustafa Hamsho middleweight championship bout at the Garden, saying, ''This fight needs some publicity.''         One of Hagler's handlers, Pat Petronelli, complained that ''it's a man's game'' and ''there's going to be a lot of blood and I don't want the three judges throwing up.''         Mrs. Shain did work the bout -- a third-round knockout by Hagler -- but the other two female judges were assigned to a title fight on the undercard.         Hagler's corner man need not have worried about Mrs. Shain being squeamish amid boxing violence, as her husband noted in remembering a conversation Ali once had with her.         ''Ali said to her, 'Eva, if you're wearing a blouse or a skirt and blood got on it, would it bother you?'         ''She replied, 'Well, it's not my blood.'         ''Ali laughed. He said, 'I didn't expect that answer.' ''       
         Viola Sheely, an actress, a singer and a founding member of the Urban Bush Women dance company, died on July 27 in Tompkins Square Park on the Lower East Side. She was 41 and lived in Manhattan and Bali.         Ms. Sheely had taken her daughter, Jessye, to the park and apparently had a heart attack, said Grisha Coleman, a friend.         The winner of a 1992 Bessie Award, which is bestowed for creative work in dance and performance art, Ms. Sheely had a long, thin body and a slightly prim demeanor that belied her intensity and daring as a performer. One of her most memorable roles was as the shy young visionary Hannah, a character inspired by the primitive painter Minnie Evans, in Jawole Willa Jo Zollar's 1990 ''Praise House.''         ''Viola Sheely's range here is impressive, but nothing prepares the audience for her last stunning soliloquy -- a bellowed, ecstatic release,'' Anna Kisselgoff, senior dance critic of The New York Times, wrote in 1991. But Ms. Sheely was just as convincing portraying the lusty, anarchic women who populate many of Ms. Zollar's pieces.         Born in Belle Glade, Fla., Ms. Sheely trained at Florida State University. In New York City, she studied with the dancer and choreographer Dianne McIntyre in the early 1980's. Ms. Sheely performed with Urban Bush Women from 1984 to 1993. She also performed in ''Vanquished by Voodoo,'' an En Garde Arts theater production, in 1992.         A founder of Hot Mouth, an a cappella singing group, she belted out songs in a show-stopping performance in 1994.         In addition to her daughter, survivors include her husband, Oded Carmi, and two sisters, Betty and Carey Sheely of Belle Glade.         Correction:  August 17, 1999, Tuesday  An obituary on Aug. 8 about Viola Sheely, a dancer and singer, misstated the relationship of a survivor and omitted a reference to four others. The survivor, Jessye, is her son, not her daughter. She also leaves her brothers Michael, Jerry, Joe and Larry, all of Belle Glade, Fla.       
         Louise Alone Thompson Patterson, an advocate of civil rights and leftist causes, a participant in the Harlem Renaissance and a longtime associate of one of its leading figures, the poet Langston Hughes, died on Friday at the Amsterdam Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 97.         The 1920's and 30's saw an artistic and literary flowering in Harlem and an outpouring of social criticism examining the position of blacks in American society. Soon after her arrival in 1928, Mrs. Patterson, then Louise Thompson, gravitated toward that intellectual ferment, which became known as the Harlem Renaissance.         Born in Chicago on Sept. 9, 1901, she had experienced racism while living in a succession of predominantly white towns in the Pacific Northwest, before entering the University of California at Berkeley, where she was inspired by a lecture on racism given by W. E. B. DuBois.         After graduating from Berkeley in 1923 with a degree in economics, she taught at Hampton Institute in Virginia, which had a black student body but a predominantly white and paternalistic administration. She supported a student strike there, then went to New York to study at the New School for Social Research under a scholarship from the Urban League.         Louise Thompson entered Harlem Renaissance circles through a friendship with the painter Aaron Douglas and his wife, Alta, and she married the writer Wallace Thurman. They separated six months later. In the late 1920's, she became a secretary to Hughes, and a long professional association and friendship began.         In 1932, after helping found a Harlem branch of the Friends of the Soviet Union, she became a leading organizer of a trip to the Soviet Union by 22 black intellectuals, journalists and writers who were to make a Soviet-sponsored movie called ''Black and White,'' about white supremacy in America.         She enlisted Hughes's participation in the trip, but the film project was canceled by Soviet authorities after the group's arrival, ostensibly because of inefficiency on the part of the Soviet film company. The real reason may have been Soviet fears that the film would create enmity in the United States and jeopardize diplomatic recognition.         Louise Thompson enjoyed her experience of Soviet society and told how ''the Russians would push us to the front of the queue line for a bus or ticket, or offer us seats in a crowded streetcar.''         ''For all of us who experienced discrimination based on color in our own land, it was strange to find our color a badge of honor, our key to the city, so to speak,'' she said.         The group eventually split into two factions. Those who saw Louise Thompson as too trusting of the Russians nicknamed her Madame Moscow.         After returning to the United States, she organized a march to Washington to speak out on the ''Scottsboro Boys'' -- nine black youths wrongly convicted of raping two white women in Scottsboro, Ala. She later traveled to Spain on behalf of the Republican cause in the Spanish Civil War.         She was an organizer of Vanguard, a left-wing salon organized at her Harlem apartment in the 1930's for cultural presentations and discussions of Marxist theory. In 1938, she helped Hughes start the Harlem Suitcase Theater, where he presented his play with music ''Don't You Want to Be Free?'' Hughes dedicated his 1942 collection of poems, ''Shakespeare in Harlem,'' to her.         In 1940, having moved to Chicago, Louise Thompson married William Patterson, a figure in the American Communist Party. He died in 1980. She is survived by a daughter, MaryLouise Patterson of Manhattan, two granddaughters and a great-grandson.       
         Chan Richardson Parker, known to many in the jazz world as the last wife of Charlie (Bird) Parker, the be-bop innovator, died on Sept. 9 in a hospital in Etampes, France, southwest of Paris. She was 74.         She died of cancer, said Albert Oehrle, the lawyer for her son, Baird Parker. She had lived in Champmotteux, south of Paris, since 1971.         She lived with Parker from 1950 until he died in 1955 at 34, his life cut short by alcohol and drug use. Robert Dobrish, the lawyer for Parker's estate, said Parker ''thought of her as his wife,'' but they were not legally spouses.         Chan Parker, a native New Yorker, was originally named Beverly Dolores Berg, but as she wrote in her 1993 memoirs, ''My Life in E-flat'' (University of South Carolina), ''I changed that name as soon as I could.'' For a time, she was a nightclub dancer. She became an avid fan of jazz and be-bop. She met Charlie Parker when he was 23 and she was 18.In 1950, she and Kim, her daughter, moved in with Parker.         In later years, Ms. Parker's activities included operating a restaurant in New Hope, Pa.         Two daughters, Pree Parker and Aimee Woods, died earlier.         Besides Baird Parker of Lansdale, Pa., she is survived by her daughter, Kim Parker, of Delaware Water Gap, Pa.; another son, Gar Woods of Long Pond, Pa., and two grandchildren.       
         Raisa Maksimovna Gorbachev, who broke Kremlin tradition by sharing the spotlight with her husband, the former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and did so with bold self-assurance and flair, died today in Munster, Germany. She was 67.         The cause was leukemia, aides to Mr. Gorbachev said. She had been under treatment in University Hospital in Munster since late July.         Mr. Gorbachev's rise to the leadership of the Communist Party in 1985 was the first sign of a seismic shift in the Soviet Union's calcified politics and economy. But it was Raisa Gorbachev who, both at home and abroad, soon came to embody the changes to come. She emerged as a First Lady who had her own mind, her own style and according to reports of a secret videotape that circulated after one of her foreign trips, her own American Express card.         None of this endeared her to the Soviet public, who began to grumble early in her husband's tenure that she was too pushy, too flashy and too influential. Her appearances on foreign trips and her cultural projects at home stirred debate in many Russian kitchens over whether the proper place for Kremlin wives was -- as it had always been -- at home, or at least in the background.         But since the beginning of this month, when Russians first learned that their former First Lady had been hospitalized in Germany with an advanced and rare case of leukemia, sentiments toward her in Russia began to shift. Favorable articles began to appear in the press, and thousands of letters and telegrams of sympathy arrived at the hospital in Munster, where her husband kept a faithful vigil that touched many Russian hearts. ''It must be in the Russian character -- to run somebody into the mud, and them laud them to high heavens after a tragedy strikes,'' said Vladimir Polyakov, a Gorbachev spokesman.         President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev's bitter rival in the early 1990's, sent a message of condolence today, and in a statement he said that a ''wonderful person, a beautiful woman, a loving wife and mother is no longer with us.''         In his autobiography, published in 1996, Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged that the resentment over his wife's high profile surfaced in letters written to the Communist Party's Central Committee. ''Who does she think she is, a member of the Politburo?'' he quoted one as saying. ''The simplest answer would have been: 'No, she is my wife.' ''         She first became known in the West in 1984 when she accompanied her husband, then a ranking member of the Soviet Politburo, to Britain, where they were received by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Diplomats and reporters, scanning the couple for clues about the next generation of Soviet leaders, quickly focused up on her wardrobe -- in particular her gold lame sandals with chain straps, a far cry from the dowdy shoes worn by other Kremlin wives. On a later trip to France, the French press labeled her clothes ''elegant, but not chic.''         On her foreign travels, she also became known for a haughty conversational style that bordered on the pedantic. During the 1986 summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, she needled her tour guides with persistent questioning, adding didactic commentary of her own. Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, she irked Nancy Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American President's wife to quip, ''Who does that dame think she is?''         As she became more comfortable in her role as the Soviet First Lady, she loosened up and her wardrobe became more subdued. On a visit to Washington in 1990, she established more friendly relations with Barbara Bush, from whom she got a recipe for blueberry pie.         Born in the Siberian city of Rubtsovsk, Raisa Titarenko grew up as the daughter of a railway engineer. She graduated from school with a gold medal -- top honors in the Soviet system -- and went on to the prestigious University of Moscow. She was studying philosophy there when she met Mr. Gorbachev, then a law student. According to his book, he was smitten, but she was aloof.         ''Our first meeting had not impressed Raisa at all,'' he wrote. ''She seemed calm and indifferent -- judging by the look in her eyes.'' Not much later, at an impromptu party staged by Mr. Gorbachev's roommates for Raisa and her friends, ''I wanted to impress her,'' he wrote, but ''I think I made a terrible fool of myself. She was reserved and was the first to suggest breaking up the gathering.''         After an intense courtship, the two penniless students were married in 1953, the year of Stalin's death. They had one daughter, Irina, born in 1956, who survives her along with Mr. Gorbachev and two granddaughters.         After the couple completed their college work in 1955, the family returned to Mr. Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol in southern Russia. There Mrs. Gorbachev completed a doctoral dissertation, entitled ''The Emergence of New Characteristics in the Daily Life of Collective Farm Peasantry,'' based on an unusual amount of field research, which was accepted by the Lenin Pedagogical Institute in Moscow.         When her husband, then first party secretary in Stavropol, was promoted to Moscow as a Central Committee secretary in charge of agriculture, she returned to academics, taking a job as lecturer in philosophy at Moscow University, a position which she gave up when he became General Secretary of the Communist Party.         As the wife of the Soviet leader, she was enlisted as a board member of the Soviet Cultural Foundation, headed by Dmitri S. Likhachev, one of Russia's most distinguished academicians, which was created to promote the arts and to restore the country's cultural heritage.         In this role, she became one of her husband's conduits to the Russian intelligentsia, which was then rallying to his call for more ''glasnost,'' or openness. As Soviet censorship eased, the Soviet people rushed to rediscover books and parts of their own history that had been buried under a rigid Communist ideology.         Mrs. Gorbachev's most traumatic moments came during the August 1991 coup, when the Gorbachevs were held hostage at a seaside villa in the Crimea while a group of Communist hard-liners tried to seize control in Moscow. The coup failed, and Mr. Gorbachev and his family returned to Moscow, visibly shaken. ''Raisa Maksimovna took it very hard,'' said Mr. Gorbachev at a news conference after their return to Moscow.         In 1991, Raisa Gorbachev published a book of reminiscences, entitled in English, ''I Hope,'' which she decided to write after a visit with Mrs. Bush in 1990 to Wellesley College where, she said, ''the girls showered me with questions.'' Reviewers found the book self-serving in parts but also informative about the couple's intellectual journey as, together, they came to realize the flaws in the Soviet system.         In her last years, Mrs. Gorbachev started a club that drew together a dozen well-known and high-powered Russian women for conferences, charitable projects and informal debates. She described the group as an attempt to promote a civil society in Russia. Against her wishes, the club became known as the Raisa Maksimovna Club.         Lyudmila Telen, a deputy editor at the newspaper Moscow News and a member of the club, said her impressions of Mrs. Gorbachev changed as she got to know her better. ''She set herself very high goals -- she felt she had to improve herself,'' said Ms. Telen. ''Going from wife of a provincial first secretary to First Lady was a big jump.         ''She wanted to represent the country in a new way. She understood that what Mikhail Sergeyevich was doing was a revolution, but she had many complexes, too -- a natural reserve and a Soviet way of behavior that she tried to overcome.''         Ms. Telen said Mrs. Gorbachev was well aware of the resentment against her felt by many Russians. But she herself was never bitter. ''She realized that people had been used to different women, different traditions, different leaders,'' said Ms. Telen. ''She understood it. It hurt her of course, but I never heard her be mean or bitter about it.''         As a couple, the Gorbachevs shared interests in philosophy and literature, theater and politics. Mr. Gorbachev on several occasions acknowledged that he often turned to his wife for advice. In his book, he recalled how the two would have their most serious discussions in the garden of their Government-provided apartment, beyond the earshot of K.G.B. eavesdropping devices.         Their close relationship was the envy of their friends. At a dinner in Paris in the fall of 1985, her host said she confided: ''I am very lucky with Mikhail. We are really friends, or if you prefer, we have great complicity.''         After the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin took over Mr. Gorbachev's office in the Kremlin, he became a political pariah in Russia, widely blamed for ushering in reforms that led to a decade of political and economic instability.         After a disastrous run for the presidency in 1996, he maintained a low profile at home, while Mrs. Gorbachev, who accompanied him on the international lecture circuit, became practically invisible until her recent illness.         With a diagnosis of acute lukemia, Mrs. Gorbachev was rushed to the hospital in Munster on July 25. News of her hospitalization became public only in early August.         According to Russian news reports, Mr. Gorbachev remained at her side day and night. ''Dear God,'' the former Soviet President, visibly exhausted, told a Russian television reporter on Aug. 9, ''for her to undergo such a drama these two days before my very eyes.''       
         Tahia Carioca, the Egyptian belly dancer often called the Marilyn Monroe of the Arab world, died of a heart attack in a Cairo hospital on Monday.  She was 79.         Miss Carioca's parents were mortified when as a teen-ager she took her beauty and talent to a Cairo nightclub to dance for strangers, but it was the beginning of a journey that would make her one of the world's most renowned belly dancers.         Though the hold of fundamentalist Islam on Egyptian society has virtually wiped out public manifestations of her art, she was in the end granted the official approval her parents withheld, as the Egyptian Culture Minister, Farouk Hosni, led her funeral procession.         The stuff of legend, she married 14 different husbands and once slapped King Farouk when he threw an ice cube down her dress. She had roles in more than 300 movies and television shows.         But beyond mere fame, she virtually defined the intricate, pulsating art called raqs sharqi in Arabic nations but known in the West as the belly dance since a promoter at the 1893 Chicago World's Fair dreamed up the name.         Belly dancers cover less territory than Western dancers, concentrating instead on often minute movements, sometimes emphasizing such tiny muscular articulations as a quivering lower lip.         ''You really liked watching her; she would draw you in,'' said Morocco, a New York dancer who was inspired by Miss Carioca and herself became a leading international performer. She recalled the intensity of Miss Carioca's musicality and her grace.         When another great Egyptian belly dancer, Samia Gamal, died in 1994, her funeral was officially ignored,  Morocco said. Her style of dancing was sometimes called coltish or kittenish, in contrast to the strength and dignity of Miss Carioca's approach.  Miss Carioca used her many films to raise the status of Middle Eastern  dance.         ''She got it recognized as part of the Egyptian fine arts landscape through her portrayals of it in movies,'' said Julie Elliot, a belly dancer who lives in the San Francisco Bay area. ''She was a pioneer of modern oriental dance as it is done today.''         Miss Carioca, originally named Abla Mohammed Karim, was born in 1920. She studied dance at Ivanova Belly Dancing School in Cairo before moving to Mohammed Ali Street, Cairo's 1930's and 40's version of Broadway. She took her stage names from the Brazilian sambas she liked to perform.         Miss Carioca became one of the biggest stars at a Cairo nightclub owned by Badia Massabni, a Lebanese woman. The club was an elegant re-creation of a British music hall and was frequented by both British colonial administrators and the local aristocracy. Women as well as men were part of the audience. Dancers wore elegant, bejeweled gowns, sometimes with bare midriffs and sometimes not.         But the nice surroundings did not make belly dancing, something that up until that time had been performed mainly at private weddings and celebrations, publicly respectable.         ''Many men would reject the trade and would never marry a female performer,'' Karin van Nieuwkerk wrote in a 1995 book about Egyptian dancers called ''A Trade Like Any Other'' and published by the University of Texas Press.         The dancer Morocco said, ''Women do not show themselves publicly outside the family and, maybe, somebody they're going to marry.''         Of course, Miss Carioca married many interesting men, among them an American army officer whom she met during World War II, an actor and a prominent playwright.         That none of the matches lasted long may have owed something to her sometimes assertive personality, Morocco said. ''She was sort of a big mouth,'' she said, ''but very sweet.''         Miss Carioca is survived by an adopted daughter, Atiyat Allah.         Her first film was ''Doctor Farahat'' in 1935, directed by Togo Mizrahi. One of her most popular movies was ''Youth of a Woman,'' in which she played a landlady who seduces a naive, young peasant student. It was shown at the 1956 Cannes International Film Festival.         ''She was an important part of Egypt's movie history,'' said the film director Gulal Sharqawi.         She gave up dancing in 1963 but as late as the mid-1980's ran her own theater in Cairo, helping to write and choose plays, as well as directing and producing.         She took to wearing the Islamic head scarf before retiring completely from public view 13 years ago.       
         Sigrid de Lima, a writer whose early works won praise but who withdrew from public life in midcareer, died on Sunday at a hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 77 and lived in Valley Cottage, N.Y.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter, Alison de Lima Greene.         Ms. de Lima burst upon the New York literary scene in 1950 with ''Captain's Beach,'' the first published novel to come out of the editor Hiram Haydn's prestigious workshop at the New School for Social Research. The tale of a handful of threadbare survivors in a shabby rooming house on the New York waterfront, the book met with mixed reviews with critics simultaneously proclaiming Ms. de Lima the next Hemingway, Dostoyevsky or Woolf, or calling her writing ''painfully studied and even windy.''         Ms. de Lima fared better with her second work, ''The Swift Cloud'' (1952), about the murder of a disabled child in a California town. The book was well received.         Her slim body of work won her a Prix de Rome in 1953, with a fellowship in literature at the American Academy of Arts and Letters in Rome. There she met and married a fellow winner, Stephen Greene, an artist.         With her ''Carnival by the Sea'' (1954), described in The Times as ''the moving story of a lovely lost Eurydice, wandering in the gaudy hell of a modern amusement park,'' critics were generally agreed on her considerable skills. After only two more works, ''Praise a Fine Day'' in 1959 and ''Oriane'' in 1968, both of which met with acclaim, Ms. de Lima ceased writing for publication, preferring instead to spend time with her family, Ms. Greene said.         In addition to her daughter, of Houston, she is survived by her husband.       
         Judith Campbell Exner, who asserted in a 1988 interview in People magazine that she had been having an affair with John F. Kennedy when he was elected President, died late Friday at the City of Hope Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., a suburb of Los Angeles.         She was 65 and lived in Orange County.         The cause was breast cancer, The Associated Press reported.         Over the years, Mrs. Exner gave varying accounts of her supposed relationship with Kennedy. But as Jeff Greenfield wrote in a review of Mrs. Exner's autobiography, ''My Story'' (1977), in The New York Times Book Review, she ''sought no publicity, at least until after a Senate committee investigating C.I.A.-Mafia connections summoned her to testify and press reports revealed her supposed connections to Kennedy'' and to Sam Giancana, a Chicago organized-crime figure.         Former aides maintained that Kennedy had not had an affair with Mrs. Exner, who was then Judith Campbell. Dave Powers, a Kennedy aide who Mrs. Exner said had assisted in setting up her encounters with the President, said in 1991, ''The only Campbell I know is chunky vegetable soup.''         In the 1988 interview, Mrs. Exner also said Kennedy had her arrange more than 10 meetings with Giancana, whom she said was also her lover. She said the meetings concerned, among other things, Kennedy's need for Giancana's help in the Democratic Presidential primary in West Virginia.         But Giancana's daughter, Antoinette, said that Giancana disliked Kennedy and that he never mentioned any contact with Kennedy while he was President.         Mrs. Exner also said that while Kennedy was in the White House she shuttled messages -- on topics including a plan to kill President Fidel Castro of Cuba -- between him and Giancana.         Kitty Kelley, who interviewed her for People, said Mrs. Exner received about $50,000 for the interview.         In Vanity Fair in 1996, Mrs. Exner said she had ended the affair, which she said had lasted two years, because she did not like being dubbed ''the other woman.''         She also said she had an abortion after becoming pregnant with Kennedy's baby, almost a year before Kennedy was assassinated.         A native New Yorker, Mrs. Exner was born Judith Immoor and was reared in California. Her marriage to an actor, William Campbell, which ended in divorce after six years, helped her make contacts within the entertainment industry.         After her divorce, she dated Frank Sinatra, and through him she met Kennedy in 1960 in Las Vegas, Nev., said her lawyer, James Lesar of Washington.         She married a professional golfer, Dan Exner, in the mid-1970's and moved to Orange County. They reportedly divorced several years ago.         Mrs. Exner is survived by a son, David Bohrer; two brothers, Allen and Fred Immoor; and a sister, Joan Collingwood.         Editors' Note:  September 30, 1999, Thursday  An obituary on Monday reported the death of Judith Campbell Exner. It quoted assertions she had made over the years that she had had an affair with John F. Kennedy before and after he was elected President.         The article reported that aides of President Kennedy's, including Dave Powers, denied the affair. But it should also have reflected what is now the view of a number of respected historians and authors that the affair did in fact take place. The evidence cited by various authorities in recent years has included White House phone logs and memos from J. Edgar Hoover.       
         Diane Erickson, a model who was on the cover of Self magazine's first issue in 1979 and who later became a fashion photographer, died on Friday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. She was 43.         She died from complications from breast cancer, said Meg D'Incecco, the public relations director of Self, a health and fitness magazine for women.         Ms. Erickson acted in several films, including ''Jagged Edge'' and ''Runaway Train.'' After her cancer was diagnosed last year, Ms. Erickson wrote a monthly chronicle of her fight against cancer called ''Diane's Diary'' for Self.         She also began to create a visual and literary record of her life and was preparing it as a book with a friend.         Mason Flaine, chairman of C.R.C. Press, a specialized publishing house, said he planned to publish the book when the friend completed it.         Born on May 24, 1956, in the Boston area, Ms. Erickson studied photography at the State University of New York at Buffalo and later worked with well-known fashion photographers.         She was legally separated from her husband, Michael Charles. She is survived by her daughter, Helena, of Manhattan; her mother, Mary Helfer of Centerville, Tex.; two brothers, John Erickson of Cleveland and Thomas Erickson of Houston, and two sisters, Christina Reid of Sugarland, Tex., and Jane Ashmore of Texas.       
         Jeanne Miles, an American painter of luminous geometric abstractions, died last Friday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 90.         Ms. Miles was born in Baltimore and grew up in Washington. She was the first woman to enroll in the art school at George Washington University. In 1937, she was given a travel grant and, determined to use it for something exotic, went to Tahiti for a year to paint. She later studied in Paris at the Atelier Marcel Gromaire and the Grand Chaumiere.  She left France after the start of World War II and came to New York, where she lived and worked in Greenwich Village for many years. She moved to Los Angeles two years ago.         Ms. Miles exhibited for many years with the Betty Parsons Gallery in New York during the gallery's  heyday, from 1943 to 1959, and counted artists like Mark Rothko, Clyfford Still and Bradley Walker Tomlin among her friends. More recently, she had solo shows in Manhattan at the Marilyn Pearl Gallery in 1988 and at the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in 1994.         The paintings in the Shapolsky show were modest in scale, based on circular and starlike patterns done in shades of rich jade green interspersed with passages of gold leaf. Although abstract, they suggested both illuminated manuscript pages and mandalas. The work reflected both the artist's long-standing interest in Asian art and thought, and her commitment to the spiritual implications of Western modernist art. ''The mandala form is universal and deeply fixed in our psyche,'' she said in an interview.         Ms. Miles's paintings were included in many group shows from the 1930's on at the Guggenheim Museum, the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, among other institutions. Her work is in the permanent collection of the Cincinnati Art Museum, the Guggenheim, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Newark Museum and elsewhere.         She received grants from the Yaddo Art Colony and the McDowell Art Colony, an award from the American Institute of Arts and Letters in 1968, and two Mark Rothko awards, in 1970 and 1973. She taught at Oberlin College, Moravian College and Yale University.         Ms. Miles is survived by a daughter, the actress Joanna Miles; a grandson, Miles Brandman, and a sister, Kitty Daffron of Florida.       
         Katie Webster, the blues and boogie-woogie pianist and singer known as the Swamp Boogie Queen, a mainstay of Gulf Coast rhythm-and-blues recordings in the 1950's and 60's and a popular touring artist in the 80's and early 90's, died on Sunday at her home in League City, Tex. She was 63.         The cause was heart failure, said her daughter Elizabeth Vereen.         Ms. Webster, born Kathryn Jewel Thorne, was reared by musicians: her father was a ragtime pianist who turned to gospel music when he became a minister in the Sanctified Church of God in Christ, in Houston, and her mother, who played spirituals and classical music, was responsible for her keyboard training.         She began her professional musical life early, although it was not the sort her parents would have encouraged: at 13 she was traveling the ''crawfish circuit'' from Dallas to New Orleans with a jazz band. At 15 she married the pianist Earl Webster, and around that time the guitarist and singer Ashton Savoy tookMs. Webster to south Louisiana to make a recording with him.         This was the beginning of a studio career that would encompass hundreds of records on Louisiana labels including Goldband and Excello. She recorded with many of the area's best-known regional musicians, including Slim Harpo, Lightnin' Slim, Clifton Chenier and Guitar Junior. She played on the original version of ''Sea of Love,'' by Phil Phillips.         In 1964 Otis Redding played at the Bamboo Club, the Lake Charles bar where Ms. Webster's band the Uptighters often played. Redding was so taken by the heavy and exact timekeeping of her left hand that he hired her immediately; for the next three years she was both his opening act and the pianist in his band. (She played on such well-known Redding albums as ''Live at the Whiskey-a-Go-Go.'')         She was pregnant and on leave from the band in 1967 when Mr. Redding undertook his final tour and died in a plane crash.         Ms. Webster did not restart her career until 1982, when she toured Europe for the first time; her hollering voice and her charismatic innuendo-laden performances won her fans, and her second act had begun. She performed in the San Francisco Bay Area and around Europe through the 1980's and recorded for the Arhoolie and Alligator labels, with Bonnie Raitt and Robert Cray showing their support in guest appearances.         A stroke in 1993 damaged her playing and her eyesight, although she continued to perform sporadically.         In addition to Ms. Vereen, of League City, she is survived by another daughter, Audrey Johnson of Houston; two sisters, Earline Allen of Houston and Irma Dews of San Pablo, Calif.; three brothers, Cyrus, Robert and Cornelius Thorne, all of San Francisco; eight grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Ellen B. Hirschland, an art collector, teacher and a great-niece of the Baltimore collectors Claribel and Etta Cone, died on Sept. 3 while traveling near St. Moritz, Switzerland. She was 80 and lived in Great Neck, N.Y.         The cause was pneumonia, said her son Edward.         Mrs. Hirschland was born in Baltimore, the daughter of Sidney Berney, a vice president at Isaac Hamburger, a clothing store in Baltimore, and Dorothy Long Berney, a niece of Etta and Claribel Cone, who amassed a world-class collection of 19th and 20th century art, including 42 Matisse oil paintings, which they bequeathed to the Baltimore Museum of Art in 1949.         When she was 17, Mrs. Hirschland traveled with Etta Cone to Paris, where she met Matisse, who became one of her lifelong friends. She also came to know other modern masters, including Chagall, Albers, Miro and Louise Nevelson.         In 1940, the year she graduated from Wheaton College, she married Paul M. Hirschland, who became a Manhattan investment banker. Mr. Hirschland died in 1988. During their marriage, the couple collected modern art and put together a group of works by artists ranging from Cezanne to Frank Stella. Mrs. Hirschland was also a trustee of the Baltimore Museum of Art.         For 35 years, Mrs. Hirschland taught art history in the adult education program in the Great Neck public schools. She also lectured widely on the Cone sisters and, with her daughter, Nancy H. Ramage, recently completed a biography about them, which is to be published by Harry N. Abrams next year.         In addition to her son Edward, of Chicago, and daughter, Nancy, of Ithaca, N.Y., she is survived by another son, Roger, of Washington.       
         Birgit Cullberg, a pioneering experimental choreographer in Sweden who earned an international reputation through her intense dramatic ballets and vigorous social-protest pieces, died on Wednesday in Stockholm, where she lived. She was 91.         Although Miss Cullberg was a disciple of the German Expressionist choreographer Kurt Jooss, her own style fused modern dance and ballet. She was resident choreographer of the Royal Swedish Ballet from 1951 to 1957, and her most famous works were danced by ballet companies throughout the world.         Among these was her acknowledged masterpiece, ''Miss Julie,'' based on the August Strindberg play; it had its premiere in Sweden in 1950. Restaged to great acclaim in 1958 for American Ballet Theater, ''Miss Julie'' was a triumph for Violette Verdy in the title role, as the Swedish aristocrat who seduces a butler, and for Erik Bruhn as Jean, the butler. Mr. Bruhn virtually made the role his own for 20 years through his astonishingly powerful portrayal.         Ballet Theater staged three other Cullberg works, including the haunting Lapp tale ''Moon Reindeer.'' In 1958 the New York City Ballet presented Miss Cullberg's ''Medea'' with Melissa Hayden in the title role. In his review, John Martin, dance critic of The New York Times, wrote, ''There is not a superfluous phrase, a meaningless gesture, an item of mere decoration in the choreography from end to end.''         Psychological insight was Miss Cullberg's strength, as she showed again in 1982 when the Cullberg Ballet, which she founded in 1967, made its belated United States debut at the Brooklyn Academy of Music with  Carl XVI Gustaf of Sweden in attendance.         Never shy about exploring the neurotic and the erotic, Miss Cullberg was represented by a duet, ''Adam and Eve,'' and an especially sensuous performance of ''Miss Julie,'' which nonetheless focused on the class differences between Julie and her servant. In ''Adam and Eve,'' Daniela Malusardi and Niklas Ek, Miss Cullberg's elder son, moved seamlessly from innocent playfulness to adult passion, a couple expelled from Eden but rejecting God as well.         Most of the other choreography was by Mats Ek, Miss Cullberg's other son, who cast her as a Mother Africa figure in his ''Soweto.'' Miss Cullberg, then 74, came out swinging, kicking, fiery-eyed and goading the oppressed onstage to resist until they collapsed to the sound of gunshots. In 1991, with her long white hair still flying, Miss Cullberg performed in Mats Ek's television dance production ''The Old Woman and the Door.''         She excelled in choreography for television. Her duet ''Red Wine in Green Glasses'' (1970) was shown on public television in the United States and was awarded the Prix Italia.         Miss Cullberg started life in a secure, wealthy home, but she had a volatile relationship with Anders Ek, one of Sweden's leading actors, whom she married in 1942. They had three children: Niklas, a brilliant dancer; Mats, 54, and his twin, the actress Malin Ek. They survive her, as do several grandchildren.         Miss Cullberg and her husband separated in 1949, and ''Medea,'' like many of her works, was interpreted by several Swedish critics as a piece that universalized her private emotions of the time.         Miss Cullberg and her husband reconciled in 1959 and both joined the new Stockholm City Theater, she as a stage director. (She directed him in ''Othello.'') The couple eventually divorced, but in the late 1970's, after Mr. Ek's death, Miss Cullberg choreographed a meditation on their life entitled ''Dreams of Love and Death.''         Born in Nykoping, Sweden, on Aug. 3, 1908, Miss Cullberg was the daughter of Ella W. Cullberg and Carl Cullberg, a bank director, and attended the University of Stockholm. After Jooss, the choreographer of the celebrated antiwar ballet ''The Green Table,'' appeared with his company in Stockholm, Miss Cullberg spent four years in England studying with him at Dartington Hall, an experimental arts center.         Returning to Sweden in 1939, she formed a small company and danced solos inspired by animal movements. In the early 1940's she studied ballet and wrote dance criticism. In 1946 she and the choreographer Ivo Cramer formed the Swedish Dance Theater, which disbanded in 1948. As the Royal Swedish Ballet's resident choreographer, she staged eight ballets.         In 1967 the Swedish Government established the current Cullberg Ballet. Writing in 1982 the Swedish critic Erik Naslund paid tribute to Miss Cullberg by declaring that it was her troupe, not the Royal Swedish Ballet, that was ''definitely the more prestigious company.''       
         Irene Heskes, a historian and author who specialized in sacred and secular Jewish music, including music of the Yiddish theater, died on Thursday at Long Island Jewish Hospital. She was 76 and lived in Forest Hills, Queens.         The cause was aplastic anemia, said Dr. Alan M. Kraut, her son-in-law.         Ms. Heskes was born in Brooklyn and studied music and history at New York University, voice and piano at the Juilliard School, music education at the Eastman School of Music and arts administration at Harvard. She completed her studies of Jewish music at the School of Sacred Music at Hebrew Union College and the Cantors Institute at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         Because she studied cantorial music in the 1950's, long before cantorial positions were available to women, Ms. Heskes worked as a researcher, writer and lecturer for the Theodor Herzl Institute of the Jewish Agency from 1964 to 1976. She was also the director of the National Jewish Music Council from 1968 to 1980 and a consultant to the American Jewish Historical Society and to libraries and academic institutions.         In 1980 Ms. Heskes founded the American Yiddish Theater Music Restoration and Revival Project. Under her direction the project assembled, catalogued and microfilmed a comprehensive collection of Yiddish theater music, which is now available for study at the Library of Congress. In 1992 the library published Ms. Heskes's annotated catalogue and resource book based on the collection.         Ms. Heskes also wrote extensively about Jewish music for academic publications and Jewish newspapers and magazines, and she wrote several books that covered the expanse of Jewish composition, including ''The Cantorial Art'' (1966); ''Ernest Bloch: Creative Spirit,'' with Suzanne Bloch, the composer's daughter (1976); ''The Resource Book of Jewish Music'' (1985); ''The Music of Abraham Goldfaden: Father of the Yiddish Theater'' (1990); ''Yiddish American Popular Songs, 1895 to 1950'' (1992), and ''Passport to Jewish Music: Its History, Traditions and Culture'' (1994). At the time of her death she was working on another book, ''Yiddish-American Music: Melodies of Immigration, Acculturation and Assimilation.''         Ms. Heskes is survived by her husband, Jacob Heskes; a daughter, Deborah Aviva Kraut of Bethesda, Md.; a son, Walter Morris Heskes of Edison, N.J., a granddaughter and two grandsons.         Correction:  October 20, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary yesterday about Irene Heskes, an author and music historian, omitted a survivor. He is her brother, Lawrence Newman of Niskayuna, N.Y.       
         Nathalie Sarraute, the Russian-born French novelist who remained an influential and innovative literary figure long after she first gained fame as the doyenne of the Nouveau Roman movement in the late 1950's, died today at her home in Paris. She was 99 and also had a country home in Cherence in Normandy.         In a writing career that lasted more than six decades, Mrs. Sarraute published 17 books, including 10 novels, although in her very first book, ''Tropisms,'' she already set the tone of her life's work. She took the book's title from the biological term for the involuntary reaction of plants to external stimuli and used it to describe the human impulses that precede gestures or words.         All her subsequent books can be understood through the prism of these tropisms, which she once described as ''the interior movements that prepare our words and actions at the limits of our consciousness.'' On another occasion, she spoke of her writing as ''sub-conversation'' through which she captured and conveyed half-formed ideas and feelings in often hesitant dialogue.         While ''tropisms'' became her tool for exploring the human spirit, her purpose was to break with the 19th-century novel of Balzac and Flaubert, which in her view, had been made obsolete by Kafka, Proust, Virginia Woolf and James Joyce. She considered these writers to be her mentors, but she went further, creating a stark literary form stripped of characters, plot and chronology, a form that Jean-Paul Sartre tagged the ''antinovel.''         ''I believe that, through my novels, I showed that it was possible to write novels where the purely fictional element was freed from the conventions that encumbered it, just as the purely pictorial element in painting has freed itself from subject matter, perspective, and so on,'' Mrs. Sarraute wrote in an essay in The New York Times Book Review in 1964.         In the 1950's, her innovative approach drew her toward several young French writers, among them Alain Robbe-Grillet, Michel Butor, Marguerite Duras, Claude Simon, and Robert Pinget, who came to be identified with the Nouveau Roman (a term borrowed from a critic for Le Monde). But while she enjoyed being discovered as a ''new novelist'' when she was already well into her 50's, her attacks on traditional literary form both anticipated and survived the movement.         Born into an intellectual Jewish family in Ivanovo, Russia, on July 18, 1900, Natasha Tcherniak -- as she then was -- had an unsettling childhood. Her father, Elie, a chemist, and her mother, Pauline, a writer, separated when she was 2 and remarried,  and she was painfully shuttled back and forth between two countries and two sets of parents. She went to Paris with her mother in 1902, moved to St. Petersburg in 1905 and then returned to Paris in 1908, where she was then brought up by her father and his new wife, Vera.         Soon fluent in German and English as well as French and Russian, she  studied law and literature at the Sorbonne and Oxford University before joining a Paris law firm in 1925, the same year that she married a fellow lawyer, Raymond Sarraute. After Germany occupied France in 1940, she escaped the fate of 76,000 Jews who were deported from France to German death camps by hiding out in a village and posing as Nicole Sauvage, the governess of her own three young daughters.         She never returned to the Paris bar. In 1932, she had begun writing ''Tropisms,'' a book comprising 24 short sketches. She finished five years later, but it was not until 1939 that she found a publisher. After the war, dedicating herself entirely to writing, she became friends with Sartre, who offered to write a preface for her first novel, ''Portrait of a  Man Unknown'' (1948), which he famously described as ''an antinovel that reads like a detective story.'' He noted, ''Nathalie Sarraute has a horror of the tricks of the novelist.''         Although Mrs. Sarraute was not drawn to existentialism, she remained friends with Sartre until Simone de Beauvoir came between them. ''She separated us completely,'' Mrs. Sarraute recalled in a 1990 interview with The Paris Review. ''But I heard that she couldn't bear Sartre having an intellectual relationship with anyone, male or female.''         Like many French writers then and now, Mrs. Sarraute liked to work at a table in a cafe, in her case one at the Trocadero near her home in the 16th arrondissement. In his memoir ''Paris in the Fifties,'' the American journalist and author Stanley Karnow, who was briefly married to Mrs. Sarraute's eldest daughter, Claude, paints a portrait of the writer as ''a lean, severe-looking woman with a hawk nose, piercing black eyes and combed-back ebony hair.''         At one point, Mr. Karnow recalled, he moved in with his wife's parents, although he was unsure whether Mrs. Sarraute's ''unpredictable Slavic temperament'' would prove too much. ''She could be uptight and relaxed, cantankerous and amiable, dour and cheerful,'' he wrote. ''Even so, I adored her -- or perhaps it was the intellectual electricity of her company.'' Mrs. Sarraute is survived by her daughter Claude and two other daughters, Anne and Dominique.         In her second novel, ''Martereau'' (1953), Mrs. Sarraute used the natural intrigue of an extended family to explore her tropisms. The book sold few copies, but it sufficed to identify her as a ''new novelist.'' Just three years later, when she published ''The Age of Suspicion,'' this book of essays about her approach to literature was presented to the public as ''the first theoretical manifestation of the Nouveau Roman school.''         Mrs. Sarraute was not prolific. After she published ''The Planetarium'' in 1959, it would take more than a decade for her to complete her next three novels -- ''The Golden Fruits'' (1963), ''Between Life and Death'' (1968) and ''Do You Hear Them?'' (1972) -- which had in common a complex and humorous self-criticism of her own creative process hidden inside a novel.         Quintessentially French in its intellectual playfulness, ''The Golden Fruits'' revolved around a discussion of the merits and demerits of an imaginary, much-acclaimed book, also called ''The Golden Fruits,'' a discussion that enabled Mrs. Sarraute to demystify the solemn language of literary criticism through parody and caricature while, at the same time, raising disturbing questions. ''It is my most abstract work,'' she said at the time.         Well received in France, ''The Golden Fruits'' appeared obscure to some American critics. ''The fact that this misty book contains some valid satirical points does not make it a rewarding novel,'' Orville Prescott wrote in The New York Times in February 1964. ''When the experimental techniques shrink the size of fiction and squeeze the juices of life out of it, they are fruitless indeed.''         Albeit eliminating even the narrator from some of her books (in which characters may be reduced to ''he,'' ''she'' and ''they''), Mrs. Sarraute was in fact always present as a form of mischievous puppeteer. In her 1983 autobiographical work, ''Childhood,'' however, she showed herself, at least how she remembered her turbulent first 12 years of life. And, typically, she recalled them through the impact of single words, like ''stupid'' and ''tragedy.''         ''Childhood'' was written in her ''predialogue'' style, which she defined as the ''little bits of something still alive'' on the border of consciousness, ''something prior to language -- a sensation, a perception.'' These feelings, she said, must be captured before they're labeled with adult words because adult words both falsify experience and render it traumatizing.         ''Childhood'' was adapted as a one-act play and presented in New York with Glenn Close. But it was less successful than several pieces that she wrote as radio plays and that were later staged, among them ''The Lie'' and ''Silence.'' In writing for theater, she was also forced to become more explicit. In novels, she said, the dialogue skimmed the surface of the sub-conversation. But in plays, the ''predialogue'' became a fully fledged dialogue. ''They later said my plays, in relation to my novels, were like a glove turned inside out,'' she told The Paris Review.         Slowing down in the mid-1980's after the death of her husband, Mrs. Sarraute nonetheless never stopped writing, occasionally demonstrating that she remained as fascinated with her explorations of language as she had been a half-century or more earlier. ''You Don't Love Yourself,'' published in 1990, is a dialogue about self-hate in which, as often is the case, there is a counterpoint between language and emotion.         ''Here,'' published in 1995 in France and in 1997 in the United States, just as Mrs. Sarraute's complete works were being reissued in France's legendary Pleiade Series, is as always a novel without plot or characters or perhaps, as suggested by Richard Burgin writing in The Washington Post, ''a poetic essay of ideas'' in which the author pursues ''the power and poverty of words.''         In France, ''Here'' was described by some critics as Mrs. Sarraute's final testimony, an apt summation of her oeuvre. But she had not yet finished. In September 1997, at the age of 97, she published ''Ouvrez,'' or ''Open,'' a 130-page book in which she denounced the impoverishment of the French language. ''It seems completely mad,'' she remarked in one interview, ''but at my age one is allowed to write things that are completely mad.'' And, unsurprisingly, she was working on yet another book at the time of her death.       
         Penelope Mortimer, an English author who drew on her complex and often turbulent relationships with men in writing novels like ''The Pumpkin Eater'' and a heatedly debated account of the romantic life of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, died on Tuesday at a London hospice. She was 81 and lived in Willesden, a suburb in north London.         Her dozen novels focus on the upper middle class in Britain. ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1962), which dealt with a troubled marriage, was made into a successful film in 1964 starring James Mason and Anne Bancroft.         Her novel ''My Friend Says It's Bulletproof'' (1968) is loosely based on an affair she had with a lawyer on a trip to Canada. ''Long Distance'' (1974), which tells Kafka-esque story of a woman confined to a bizarre institution, was one of the few novels to be published in its entirety in The New Yorker.         Ms. Mortimer also wrote two highly praised volumes of memoirs and several television screenplays, including her adaptation of ''Portrait of a Marriage,'' the 1973 biography of Vita Sackville-West and her husband, Harold Nicolson, by Nigel Nicolson, their son.         Shown in the United States in 1992 as a three-part series on ''Masterpiece Theater'' on PBS, the programs were upsetting to many viewers because of their portrayal of homosexual liaisons and lesbian love scenes.         Ms. Mortimer was well known if not always beloved in Britain for her biography ''Queen Elizabeth: A Life of the Queen Mother'' (1986), which delved into the subject's romantic life before her marriage to the future King George VI.         Ms. Mortimer, the former Penelope Ruth Fletcher, was born in Oxfordshire, the daughter of a vicar who periodically professed to have lost his faith in God. When she was 16, she attended the Central Educational Bureau for Women in London  to learn secretarial skills.         In 1937 she married Charles Dimont, a Reuters correspondent with whom she lived in Vienna and observed the German annexation of Austria. Divorced in 1949, she married John Mortimer, the author, the same year.         She is survived by a son, Jeremy Mortimer of London; five daughters, Madelon Dimont Burk of France, Caroline Bennett of London, Julia Mankowitz of London, Deborah Rogers of Cornwall, England, and Sally Silverman of Bristol, England, and 11 grandchildren.         In the 1950's and 60's the couple were frequently photographed at London society events and, The London Daily Telegraph's obituary said, they ''seemed to represent the last word in marital chic.'' Behind this facade, however, Ms. Mortimer had  frequent bouts of depression. The marriage ended in divorce in 1972.       
         Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who sold her first book for $1 million when she was 98, died on Saturday in a hospital in Duluth, Minn., where she was vacationing with her daughter. She was 100.         Miss (her preference) Foveaux (pronounced FOH-voh), a snowy-haired great-great-grandmother, lived a literary fairy tale when she turned a memoir she wrote in a writing class for senior citizens in her hometown, Manhattan, Kan., into the book ''Any Given Day.''         In a 1997 auction Warner Books paid $1 million for the rights to publish the book.         In its 208 pages, she told of the quietly heroic struggle of a woman to win her independence while she was in a bitter marriage to an alcoholic. She worked in a laundry and as a nurse's aid to support her eight children before and after the divorce.         Her book, never intended for publication, ''just poured out,'' said Charley Kempthorne, a part-time farmer who taught a writing class at the Manhattan Adult Learning Center. ''She had bottled it up for many, many years.''         Miss Foveaux was an unschooled and unskilled writer, but she was clearly a born storyteller. Her words were straightforward. Of her decision to divorce, she wrote, ''I made up my mind to live my life so that I need not be ashamed to look at myself in a mirror.''         The book, which she began in 1977 and took several years to write, came to light only after an article about it appeared in 1997 on the front page of The Wall Street Journal to which Mr. Kempthorne had sent a copy. The article set off a frenzy to buy the book, leading to the auction.         The editor who acquired it, Claire Zion, called the writing ''very plain, very clear,'' and said that it would be altered only insignificantly for publication. ''We in New York try to sit here and think what the country is thinking,'' she said. ''This is Kansas talking.''         The book auction and the publicity visit to New York transported her to a new world. Miss Foveaux flew for the first time, took limousines, stayed at fancy hotels, appeared on talk shows and was written about in newspapers. She took it all with a big grain of salt.         ''I imagine I'll be like everyone else that ever got into a mess like this,'' she said.         The book was published in 1997 and remains in print but was not a best seller, despite the wide pre-publication publicity it received.         Miss Foveaux was born in Holden, Mo., in 1899, at a time when the world of Mark Twain was fading into memory. Her early childhood was spent on a small Missouri farm, but then her family moved frequently, to Arkansas and Washington State, among other places. As World War I started, she got her first job and fell in love with a young soldier. He vanished in the war, her beloved mother died, and the Depression wreaked hardship. She had eight children. As her book related, she struggled to maintain them in difficult circumstances.         She is survived by two daughters, Faye Marie Rutledge of Winder, Ga., and Aleda Torgerson of Silver Bay, Minn., and a son, Marion, of Manhattan, Kan., as well as 16 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.         In an interview after the $1 million auction, she was asked if she would buy cars and houses for her relatives. She shot back, ''They didn't help me, did they?'' The article describes family members bursting into nervous laughter.       
         Jeraldyne Blunden, the founder and artistic director of the Dayton Contemporary Dance Company, died on Monday at the Franciscan Medical Center in Dayton, Ohio. She was 58 and lived in Dayton.         The cause was renal failure, said Phyllis Brzozowska, executive director of Dayton Contemporary Dance.         In addition to guiding the small modern-dance troupe to national prominence over its 30 years of existence, Mrs. Blunden developed a number of leading American modern dance performers, among them the former Alvin Ailey star Donna Wood. Mrs. Blunden, who was awarded a MacArthur Foundation grant in 1994, was also a major and much-honored proponent of the contributions of black choreographers and performers to American modern dance.         But Mrs. Blunden had mixed feelings about that role. ''Everything in America is labeled,'' she said in a 1996 interview. ''You could call what I do black dance because I'm a black-dance person. What I do is from a black perspective. But people who are sure of themselves don't bother with that.'' That no-nonsense approach to life was mixed with steely determination, a great personal warmth and humor and an unsentimental humanity that made her a much-loved figure on the national dance scene.         Mrs. Blunden began her dance training at 8, in Dayton, her hometown, with Josephine and Hermene Schwarz , the founders of the Dayton Ballet. As a teenage student at the American Dance Festival, Mrs. Blunden had her first important experience of modern dance. ''There was Martha Graham,'' she recalled in 1996. ''Jose Limon. Merce Cunningham was the new young man on the block and we flocked to his classes, of course. My first musical concert away from home was John Cage. I thought I was in the wrong place because he played everything but the keys on the piano.'' Dayton Contemporary Dance Company would later become the first black dance troupe to acquire a Cunningham work, ''Channels/Inserts.''         Mrs. Blunden performed with several ballet and modern companies in Dayton, continuing her dancing through college, marriage and motherhood, when she began to teach. She took her students to regional ballet competitions around the country and raised money to bring them to a summer session at Arthur Mitchell's Dance Theater of Harlem in New York. She formed the company to give her dancers a place to perform, at first creating the repertory herself. One of her early dancers was her daughter, Debbie Blunden-Diggs. She chose her daughter along with the choreographer and dancer Kevin Ward to succeed her as artistic directors of the company.         Mrs. Blunden's honors also included the Dance Magazine Award of 1998 and the 1999 Dance USA Honors Award. In 1997, she was one of five female dance company directors honored as ''living legends'' by 651: An Arts Center.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her husband, Charles Blunden, her mother, Winifred Kilborn, and a sister, Carol Ann Shockley, all of Dayton; a son, Derek, of Charleston, W. Va., and four grandchildren.       
         Sufia Kamal, a Bangladeshi poet, political activist and feminist, died at age 88 on Nov. 20 and was buried four days later with full state honors, the first woman to receive that recognition from Bangladesh.         As the national flag was lowered and buglers saluted, about 10,000 people paid their respects to Ms. Kamal at her funeral on Wednesday in Dhaka.         Born into wealth, she had devoted her life to fighting for the rights of women and the poor and against the forces of religious fundamentalism.         ''This poet was the beacon for our great language movement and liberation war, and inspiration for all democratic movements of the nation,'' Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina of Bangladesh said at the ceremony. ''This poet was a vast source of inspiration for building up womenfolk as self-reliant.''         Sufia Kamal was born in 1911 in Barisal, the southern district of what is now Bangladesh, the only daughter of an eminent lawyer. As a woman, she did not have an opportunity to pursue an education, but she educated herself in her uncle's library with her mother's encouragement.         She was first married at the age of 11 to her cousin Syed Nehal Hossain, then a law student. They had a daughter, Amena Kahnar, and Mr. Hossain died in 1932. Five years later, Ms. Kamal married Kamaluddin Ahmed.         In addition to her first daughter, Ms. Kamal is survived by two other daughters, Sultana Kamal and Saida Kamal; two sons, Shahed Kamal and Sazid Kamal; three grandsons, and three great-granddaughters.         She published her first story at 14,  and her prose and poems drew favorable notice. Some works were aimed at children. Some were translated into English and Russian. Increasingly, she wrote against religious communalism, fundamentalism and superstitions. She promoted democracy and women's emancipation.         ''The culture was to keep the women at home, train them in household chores and make them perfect women: docile, ready to please everyone in the family,'' she said in an interview earlier this year. ''There was a strong anti-British movement, and my family also believed that women should stay out of it.         ''But I had an indomitable nature and I crossed my limits to get a taste of all there was. I was allowed to learn Arabic and a little Persian, but not Bengali. I made it a point to learn Bengali from people working in the house.'' That became the language she used for her writing.         Though she called herself a romantic poet, her work more and more reflected the struggles to preserve the Bengali language and culture and to fight Pakistani rulers. During Bangladesh's struggle for independence from Pakistan in the early 1970's she worked to help women hurt by the war. She also worked with an organization to try to bring to justice those Pakistani officials whom the Bangladeshis considered war criminals.         In later life, she made women's rights her top priority and headed Bangladesh's largest women's organization for many years. She did not see the oppression of women as mainly a class issue.         ''My own experience as a woman made me sensitive toward the condition of women of all classes,'' she said. ''Be poor or middle class or upper class, the violence against women in family, society and in public life was always there. Women were exploited and deprived of opportunities.''         In 1993, an Islamic fundamentalist group called for her execution as punishment for her denunciation of the fundamentalists' treatment of women. Her response was quiet resistance rather than the stronger advocacy of an earlier Bangladeshi poet, Taslima Nareen, who fled the country for fear of reprisals.         Ms. Kamal's strongest and most thoughtful sentiments may have appeared in her poems rather than her prose.         One poem, ''Our Language: The Language of Bengal,'' ends with the following lines:         For our language many have died,         drawn from the arms of our mother         but down the road, smeared with their blood         I hope freedom will come to this land:         the simple language of a simple people         Will meet the demands of this our land.         Before her death Ms. Kamal specified that she preferred to be buried in a simple private cemetery rather than in the national cemetery, where her nation's leaders had suggested she be buried. Her views on the country's leaders, expressed in the interview earlier this year, suggest why.         ''Our people are courageous; our leaders are not,'' she said. ''Today they recourse to bombastic rhetoric but never take bold decisions because they may be unpleasant. Why? Because they lack courage.''       
         Bethel Leslie, a lifelong presence onstage and on television whose final Broadway performance earned her a Tony nomination, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, said Leslie McCullough Jeffries, her daughter.         The daughter of a lawyer and a socialite, Ms. Leslie was a 15-year-old student at the Brearley School on the Upper East Side when she was discovered by the producer George Abbott and cast as the girl next door in the 1944 Broadway production of ''Snafu,'' a comedy.         The role began Ms. Leslie's career, which included appearances in 10 Broadway plays before she was 25 and which had her acting alongside the likes of Fredric March (''Years Ago,'' in 1946), Sam Wanamaker (''Goodbye, My Fancy'' in 1948) and Helen Hayes (''The Wisteria Trees,'' in 1950).         Her breakthrough came in 1955, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in which she played the conflicted daughter of a Bible-wielding reverend. The part earned Ms. Leslie strong reviews, and she soon headed to Hollywood. There she found steady work in television, parlaying her dark good looks into roles on shows like ''Gunsmoke,'' ''Perry Mason'' and ''The Fugitive.''         A 1965 press biography listed some of her character roles as ''a cheating wife, a husband-framing mistress'' and ''the wife of a confessed murderer.''         Ms. Leslie made her film debut in 1964 in ''Captain Newman, M.D.,'' as the wife of a traumatized Air Force pilot, played by Robert Duvall.         By 1965 she had returned to New York and to the theater, though appearances on soap operas helped support that passion. As a side pursuit Ms. Leslie began to write, eventually becoming a head writer for the daytime drama ''The Secret Storm.''         It was not until 1986, however, that she scored her biggest triumph, appearing as the morphine-addicted mother in Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey into Night,'' a performance that Frank Rich of The New York Times called ''exceptionally beautiful.'' Her work earned her a Tony nomination.         In recent years she appeared Off Broadway in productions with the Signature Theater Company and most recently with the Women's Project, where she won praise this spring for her work in Joan Vail Thorne's play ''Exact Center of the Universe.''         In addition to her daughter, who lives in New York, Ms. Leslie is survived by a brother, Warren Leslie, also of New York, and two grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Perriand, the French designer who created furniture with Le Corbusier in the 1920's and 30's and was rediscovered as a modernist legend in her own right in the 1980's and 90's, died at her home in Paris on Oct. 27. She was 96.         Through a productive career spanning eight decades, Ms. Perriand designed tubular ''equipment for living'' with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret, bamboo furniture in Japan, lobbies for Air France in London and Tokyo, workers' housing in the Sahara and ski resort interiors in the French Alps.         Her ideas about flexible space, free-form shapes, natural materials and furniture designed to make ''space sing'' made her a modernist with a humanist agenda. The legs on her dining table were splayed, for example, so that people sitting at the ends could stretch their legs.         Preferring to be known as an interior architect instead of a furniture designer, Ms. Perriand subscribed to the modernist notion that furnishings and architecture needed to be developed as a single entity.         Her collaborations were often especially productive. The primary-colored bookcase with cupboards painted by Sonia Delaunay for the dormitory for Tunisian students at the Cite Universitaire in Paris and the lighting table (table and fluorescent overhead lights in one) she designed with Jean Prouve in 1953 are prized by collectors and sometimes reproduced without authorization.         ''For nearly three quarters of a century, Perriand has been one of the major innovators in French design, and her career embraces much of the history of 20th-century design in France,'' said Mary McLeod, an architectural historian at Columbia University.         Ms. Perriand was born in Paris on Oct. 24, 1903. Her early talent for drawing led her to the Ecole de l'Union Central des Arts Decoratifs. By 1926 she had been selected to exhibit her work at the Exposition Internationale des Arts Decoratifs, from which the name of the Art Deco movement derives.         Her ''bar under the roof,'' an installation featuring a built-in chrome-walled bar counter and card table with pool-pocket drink holders, caused a sensation at the 1927 Salon d'Automne and established her as an avant-garde talent to watch.         Believing that she had nowhere to go but to the top, as she told Roger Aujame, a friend and former Corbusier Foundation director who is working on a catalog of her works, Ms. Perriand sought a job at Le Corbusier's studio. His initial withering response, ''We don't embroider cushions here,'' has become part of modernist lore. But once he went to see her bar installation, Le Corbusier hired her on the spot.         The years from 1927 to 1937 that she spent working with Le Corbusier and Pierre Jeanneret were formative and soon, like Corbusier, Ms. Perriand was making manifesto-style declarations about ''the new man'' and wearing her signature necklace of steel ball bearings. But it was her love of nature, especially the mountains where she often retreated, and her pragmatism that tempered the strict angularities of their furniture classics like the chaise longue and the famous cube-shaped Grand Confort chair.         In 1940 Ms. Perriand was invited to Japan, where she used traditional materials like bamboo, pine and woven straw to make modern shapes. When war broke out, she moved to Vietnam; unable to get a return visa to France, she worked for the colonial government. There she met Jacques Martin, a local official, whom she married in 1943. (An earlier, brief marriage in 1926 ended in divorce.) The couple had one daughter in 1944, Pernette Perriand, now an architect in Paris. Mr. Martin died in 1986.         Ms. Perriand returned to Paris in 1946 and was soon working on a wide range of projects, from ski resorts to student housing. Fiercely independent, she rejected frequent requests to furnish interiors designed by other architects. But she was eager to work with Mr. Prouve, the designer and manufacturer who collaborated with her and produced several of her designs from 1951 to 1953. She also collaborated again with Le Corbusier on the Unite d'Habitation housing project in Marseilles.         Ms. Perriand continued to travel to Japan and Brazil for inspiration, but spent much of her time from 1967 to 1982 working on the Arcs, a vast compound of ski resorts in the Alps.         In the 1980's the retrospectives of her work began, first at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in 1985 and then at the Pompidou Center in Paris and the Design Museum in London in 1996 and the Architectural League in Manhattan in 1997. But Ms. Perriand looked ahead, not back, and at the time of her death was exploring the possibilities of new materials for the 21st century.         At a league lecture, Ms. Perriand told the young design students there, ''We are leaving the age of oak and entering a period that will be defined by lightness, suppleness and the ephemeral.''       
         Charlotte Perriand, the French designer who created furniture with Le Corbusier in the 1920's and 30's and was rediscovered as a modernist legend in her own right in the 1980's and 90's, died at her home in Paris on Oct. 27. She was 96.

         Ranjabati Sircar, a dancer and choreographer who fused India's classical and folk dance traditions with experimental forms from the West, died in Bombay on Oct. 23. She was 36 and lived in Calcutta.         The cause was unknown, said Jonathan Hollander, a friend and the artistic director of the Battery Dance Company in New York.         Ms. Sircar was the daughter of Manjusri Chaki-Sircar, one of India's best-known dancers. Together they established a school in Calcutta, Dancers' Guild, that focused on what they called navanritya, a contemporary form of Indian dance with its own technique and training system.         Ms. Sircar was born in Nigeria and grew up in the United States. She graduated from Jadavpur University in Calcutta and trained in classical and folk dance in India. She sought, however, a creative synthesis of modern dance from the West with classical Indian traditions.         In 1990 she participated in the International Choreographers Workshop of the American Dance Festival in Durham, N.C., and in 1992 she founded the South Asian Dance Youth Company, which won her the London Dance and Performance Award. Ms. Sircar wrote ''Navanritya: Toward Contemporary Indian Dance.'' She is survived by her mother, of Calcutta.       
         Georgia Hofmann, an owner and breeder of thoroughbred racehorses, including the Triple Tiara winner Sky Beauty, died Sunday at her home in Bal Harbour, Fla. She was 91.         The cause was complications from leukemia, which was diagnosed several months ago, said Lawrence G. Foster, a family spokesman.         Mrs. Hofmann learned to ride horses bareback and said that was when her love for them began. In 1962, she bought her first racehorse, a filly named Calabrea, who won her first race and paid $72 to win.         ''That horse was the real reason I am in the racing business today,'' she said years later. She did most of her own buying and selling, and bred or owned such outstanding horses as Gold Beauty, named the champion sprinter in 1982, Louis Quatorze, winner of the 1996 Preakness, Gold Stage, Maplejinsky, Dayjur, Royal Indy and Bankers Gold.         But the pride and prize of the lot was Sky Beauty, a daughter of the European champion Blushing Groom and a granddaughter of Nijinsky II. She came into prominence in 1992, when she won five starts. And, in 1993, she was only the eighth filly to win the Triple Tiara, the equivalent of the Triple Crown for fillies.         Mrs. Hofmann was the widow of Philip B. Hofmann, a retired chairman of Johnson & Johnson, the health care products company. Mr. Hofmann's lifelong interest in horses centered on jumpers, show horses and coach-and-four competitions. He left the thoroughbred racing to his wife, and when at the racetrack he often said: ''I'm just here to watch. She's the expert.''         Mrs. Hofmann's first marriage, to Fred R. Fehlhaber, ended in divorce.         Georgia Hofmann was born Georgia Ellis on a farm near Montgomery, Ala. She became a fashion model in New York and had a minor part in a musical production staged by Florenz Ziegfeld. But she seemed to have a sixth sense about a racehorse's breeding and racing potential. She spent long hours studying books and reports on bloodlines.         Mrs. Hofmann, who owned Wycombe House Stud, a 218-acre horse farm in Ocala, Fla., earned more than $12 million through the sale of 22 horses, including Sky Beauty.         Although she was ill, Mrs. Hofmann attended the Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream Park in Florida on Nov. 6. The next day, she flew to Lexington, Ky., to preside over the sale of the last of her racehorses.         She is survived by a sister, Elizabeth St. Almond of Jacksonville, Fla.; two stepdaughters, Judy Hofmann Richter of Bedford, N.Y., and Carol Hofmann Thompson of Colts Neck, N.J.; a stepson, Robert F. Fehlhaber of Fort Lauderdale, Fla; and two stepdaughters, Chris Fehlhaber McGuire of Vero Beach, Fla., and Julie Fehlhaber Flavell of Fort Lauderdale.         Mrs. Hofmann, who never had children, often referred to her horses as ''my babies.''       
         Edmona Lyman Mansell, who founded the Freedom Institute in Manhattan and was one of the first alcoholism counselors in New York to promote intervention as a treatment technique, died Nov. 11 at a hospital in Jupiter, Fla. She was 70.         The cause was emphysema, said her daughter Jessica Mansell Ambrose of East Hampton, N.Y.         Mrs. Mansell, who was known as Mona, was a recovering alcoholic and a volunteer counselor at the National Council on Alcoholism in New York when she started the Freedom Institute in 1976.         That year, she had visited the Johnson Institute in Minneapolis, Minn., which had developed a technique called intervention in which family and friends persuaded alcoholics to enter treatment.         Mrs. Mansell, a native of San Francisco, lived in New York before retiring to Jupiter Island, Fla. She was chairwoman of the Freedom Institute and a director of the National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependency.         Besides her daughter Jessica, she is survived by her husband, Frank L. Mansell; four sons, Robert L. Miller of Los Angeles, Charles B. Miller of Twin Bridges, Mont., Christian F. Miller of Hamilton, Mont., and Gordon L. Miller of Santa Fe, N.M.; another daughter, Devon Mansell Laycox of Sherborn, Mass.; a sister, Princess Genevieve di San Faustino of San Francisco; and 12 grandchildren.       
         Gaby Casadesus, a pianist and teacher whose specialty was the 19th- and 20th-century French piano repertory, and who often performed in a piano duo with her husband, Robert Casadesus, died on Nov. 12 at her home in Paris. She was 98.         Mrs. Casadesus, whose name was originally Gaby L'Hote, was born in Marseilles in August 1901. She entered the Paris Conservatoire when she was 12, and became a student of Marguerite Long and Louis Diemer. She graduated from the Conservatoire with first prize in piano when she was 16 and soon established herself with performances of the piano works of Faure, Ravel and Milhaud, which she studied with the composers' guidance.         Her recitals also reached further back into the French keyboard literature to include music of Rameau, Couperin and Chopin. She was known as an elegant Mozart interpreter, and in 1923 she was awarded the Prix Pages, recognizing the achievement of female pianists in France.         When she was still at the Conservatoire she met Robert Casadesus, another student of Diemer, two years her senior. The two began giving performances of duo piano works together, and they married in 1921. Robert Casadesus wrote several works for the duo, including Six Pieces (1938), and a Concerto for Two Pianos, which they first performed in Warsaw in 1934, and with the New York Philharmonic in 1950.         In the 1960's their son Jean Michel Casadesus sometimes joined them for performances of the Bach Triple Concerto and Robert Casadesus's Concerto for Three Pianos. Jean Michel Casadesus died in an automobile accident in January 1972; Robert Casadesus died that September. Mrs. Casadesus is survived by a daughter, Therese Casadesus Rawson of Berwyn, Pa., and another son, Guy Casadesus of Toulon, France, as well as five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.         During World War II the Casadesus family settled in Princeton but returned to France in 1946. Both were influential teachers at the American Conservatory at Fontainebleau, France. Mrs. Casadesus also gave regular master classes at the Salzburg Mozarteum and at several French and American universities. She was the author of two books, ''Ma Technique Quotidienne'' (''My Daily Technique,'' written with Philip Lasser, one of her students) and ''Mes Noces Musicales'' (''My Musical Wedding,'' written with J. Muller).         After her husband's death she helped found an annual summer festival in Lille, France, with her nephew, the conductor Jean-Claude Casadesus, and in 1975 she started the Robert Casadesus International Piano Competition, in Cleveland. She also devoted herself to performing and publishing her husband's compositions.       
         Pearl Resnick, the matriarch of a prominent New York real estate family and a philanthropist, died yesterday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.         Mrs. Resnick, whose maiden name was Ezaak, was born on Jan. 3, 1912, in Okna, Ukraine. She came to the United States with her family in 1923.         Nine years later, she married Jack Resnick, who had started a small real estate business in 1928. It grew into one of New York's largest development and construction companies, Jack Resnick & Sons. Mr. Resnick died in 1991.         Mrs. Resnick was a member of the board of overseers of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine of Yeshiva University, in the Bronx.         In addition, she was also a trustee at Yeshiva and a major contributor to both institutions.         Together, the Resnicks established the Jack and Pearl Resnick Gerontology Center and the Jack and Pearl Resnick Fellowship in Geriatrics at Albert Einstein. Mrs. Resnick also endowed an academic chair in brain tumor research in memory of her daughter, Susan Resnick Fisher, who died in 1993.         In recognition of Mr. and Mrs. Resnick's support, the campus of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine was named in their honor in 1990.         Gershon Kekst, president of Kekst & Company, a New York public relations firm, said that Mrs. Resnick's character and charm were as important as her ability to raise money. Mr. Kekst, who is chairman of the Jewish Theological Seminary, recalled that about eight years ago, when the seminary was in financial straits, Mrs. Resnick joined the board and put everyone at ease. Mr. Kekst said that after a board meeting, Mrs. Resnick told him: ''That was a very good meeting. Things are going to be all right.''         Mrs. Resnick was a board member of Bar-Ilan University near Tel Aviv. She and her husband also helped finance the Jack and Pearl Resnick Film Division of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.         She is survived by two sons, Burton P. Resnick of Rye, N.Y., and Ira Resnick of Manhattan; a daughter, Marilyn Katz of Purchase, N.Y.; a sister, Anna Sherman of Yonkers; 10 grandchildren; and 5 great-grandchildren.       
         Gloria Caruso Murray, a visual artist who was the last surviving child of Enrico Caruso, died on Dec. 5 at St. Luke's Hospital in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 79 and had briefly tried to live up to the musical world's sentimental fantasy that she had inherited her father's vocal abilities.         She died of cancer, said Aldo Mancusi, curator of the Caruso Museum in Brooklyn.         Only hours after his daughter's birth on Dec. 18, 1919, at the Knickerbocker Hotel just a stone's throw from the old Metropolitan Opera House in New York, Caruso, then the most famous operatic tenor in the world, exuberantly tossed the girl into the air, peered into her mouth and announced, ''Ah, she has the vocal cords, just like her daddy!''         A year and a half later, Caruso was dead at 48 -- a loss that nourished a popular fantasy that his child would also have an extraordinary voice.         At age 7, when she and her mother returned to New York from a vacation in Europe, a New York newspaper ran the headline ''Gloria Caruso, Here With a Voice'' and pronounced her ''a potential opera star of the first magnitude.''         The next year she made her first record. At 11, she made her first public appearance, delivering a radio address on behalf of a charity headed by President Herbert Hoover. Later that year she made a test recording for RCA Victor, and John McCormack, another renowned tenor, gave her singing lessons and announced that she had promise.         The press had an immense appetite for even the slightest tidbits of news about the great Caruso's daughter. But it gradually became apparent that she did not have the voice to follow her father.         In 1942, Ms. Murray told a reporter that she was studying art at the Art Students League in New York and that she had come to prefer the visual arts to music. ''I've always been torn between art and music,'' she said. ''Daddy drew and sculptured as a hobby. And Mommy draws. Art is as much in the family as singing.''         In marrying Caruso, her mother, an American named Dorothy Benjamin, created a tumult in 1918. Her father, Park Benjamin, a wealthy patent lawyer and New York society figure, fiercely opposed the match between his daughter, then 25, to Caruso, who was 45. After the couple eloped, Park Benjamin disowned her. When he died in 1925, he left her $1 from his substantial estate.         In 1943, Gloria Caruso married Ensign Michael Hunt Murray, who had left Harvard to become a naval aviator in World War II. The couple had two sons but later divorced.         Ms. Murray set up a studio in New York City where she painted both portraits and landscapes. Later she lived in Miami and, for the last 10 years, in Jacksonville.         Andrew Farkas, co-author with Enrico Caruso Jr. of ''Enrico Caruso: My Father and My Family'' (Amadeus Press, 1990), said that Ms. Murray's paintings were ''of good quality, although she sold very few.''         ''She became rather reclusive,'' Mr. Farkas said, adding, ''She had been answering questions about her father for a long time.'' Eric D. Murray, one of Ms. Murray's sons, said his mother had become occupied with managing the family estate after her mother died in 1957.         Matters were complicated because Caruso had left no will. In 1928, a court in Trenton had ruled that Gloria Caruso was entitled to two-thirds of the royalties on her father's phonograph records, sold by the Victor Talking Machine Company.         Gloria Caruso attended Miss Hewitt's Classes in New York City, the Ozanne School in Paris, the Bishop School in La Jolla, Calif., and Miss Nixon's School in Florence, Italy.         In addition to her son Eric, of Maryland, she is survived by her other son, Colin D. Murray of Jacksonville.         Mr. Farkas wrote that Enrico Caruso had four children from a relationship with Ada Giacchetti, a soprano who had left her husband to live with the tenor before his marriage to Miss Benjamin. Only one, Enrico Caruso Jr., sought a career as a singer. All are deceased.       
         Jill Craigie, a devoted socialist and feminist who became one of Britain's first successful female film directors and whose half-century marriage to the Labor Party leader Michael Foot put her at the heart of the country's leftist politics, died on Monday in London. She was 85.         Ms. Craigie first made her mark in documentary filmmaking with ''Out of Chaos,'' a 1943 film about modern art; ''The Way We Live,'' a 1946 study of the effects of the German blitzkrieg on Plymouth, and ''Blue Scar,'' a 1948 look at life in an impoverished Welsh mining village. It was while making her film in Plymouth that she met Mr. Foot, then a candidate for Parliament. She interviewed him and a relationship began.         Ms. Craigie was born in Derbyshire to a Scottish father and a Russian emigre mother and had, by her own estimation, a wretched childhood. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. Her father was killed in World War I and her mother lived mostly abroad.         ''I used to spend most of my holidays at boarding school,'' she once said. ''I went to a dozen different boarding schools over the years and never learned anything. I was one of the rootless people. I had a very lonely childhood indeed. I turned to writing because I was lonely.''         After school, she moved to London and began writing an advice column and horoscopes for a women's magazine called Betty's Paper. She quickly found her way into artistic and literary circles. When she was 19, she married a sculptor, Claude Begbie-Clench, and they had a daughter, Julie. The marriage was short-lived.         Soon after, she married Jeffrey Dell, a scriptwriter for the movie producer Alexander Korda, and they wrote a play called ''The Judge,'' which was staged in London in 1938. This marriage was also short-lived, but Ms. Craigie was able to use the connections she made through Mr. Dell to get work in the British film industry, first making sports films and later turning to feature-length documentaries.         During these years, Ms. Craigie was romantically linked to many prominent artists and writers.         Mr. Foot and Ms. Craigie did not marry for almost two years after their meeting in Plymouth, though they lived together for much of that time. They finally married in 1949, she once said, to assuage the concerns of Mr. Foot's family.         Though many at the time doubted that Ms. Craigie's third marriage would last longer than the first two, theirs turned out to be a close and loving relationship, friends said.         She is survived by her husband and daughter.         Ms. Craigie's work as a filmmaker and writer dwindled after her third marriage, though she did write the screenplay for ''The Million Pound Note,'' renamed ''Man With a Million,'' a 1953 film starring Gregory Peck that was filmed in London.         In 1952, she wrote and produced a BBC radio documentary about the British suffragist movement, a subject that was near to her heart since a chance meeting in 1940 with a group of aging suffragists at a memorial service for one of their members.         For the last decades of her life, Ms. Craigie was said to be at work on a  history of the movement, left unfinished at her death.         In 1967, she made a television documentary called ''Who Are the Vandals?'' that was critical of housing developers. In 1995, she made ''Two Hours From London,'' a documentary about the former Yugoslavia.         As Mr. Foot's political career prospered, Ms. Craigie became known as one of his confidantes as well as the hostess for many Labor Party gatherings at the couple's home. When Mr. Foot became chief of the Labor Party in 1980, beginning a three-year leadership that ended with a crushing defeat for the party in 1983, a few asserted that he was being pushed by an ambitious wife. Ms. Craigie demurred.         ''He would be in exactly the same position he is in today had he not been married to me, except he wouldn't have had such a nice house,'' she said.       
         Dorothy Allison, a self-proclaimed psychic with a knack for turning up at the scenes of notorious crimes, died on Dec. 1 at Clara Maass Medical Center in Belleville, N.J. She was 74 and lived in Nutley, N.J.         The cause was heart failure, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Allison, a small woman in thick, oversized glasses, materialized to offer to solve crimes including the Patricia Hearst kidnapping, the ''Son of Sam'' killings, the murders of children in Atlanta and the death of JonBenet Ramsey. She was not successful in those cases, but her supporters insist that she hit the mark on others.         Chief Robert DeLitta of the Nutley Police Department, which became something of a booking agent for Ms. Allison, said, ''The information she provided was very, very accurate -- right on the money.'' He said hundreds of police departments from all over the world called the Nutley police to reach her.         Her fame made her the emblem of a vigorous debate about the efficacy  and legitimacy of so-called psychic detectives. ''Dorothy couldn't locate Patty,'' Randolph Hearst, Patricia's father, said in a Newsweek interview. ''But she is honest and reputable. I wouldn't laugh at it.''         But skeptics, many armed with volumes of research, insist that psychics have never solved a single crime. Joe Nickell, a columnist for Skeptical Inquirer, the magazine of the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal, said in an interview that psychic detectives use a trick called ''retrofitting,'' which involves tossing out several clues, like a number or a mention of water, that are interpreted to fit the facts after they become known.         Police departments may waste valuable time and resources digging in specific spots and draining ponds on the erroneous advice of a psychic, he said. ''Certainly Dorothy Allison caused a great deal of -- I'm sure unintended -- mischief,'' he said.         Michael Shermer, the publisher of Skeptic magazine, said in an interview that psychic detectives commonly make logical predictions; for example, they suggest that a corpse will be found in a remote area.         ''If you have a body, are you going to dump it in a crowded city?'' he asked.         When Ms. Allison named names, they were not always the right ones. In the case of the murders of about a dozen black children in Atlanta in 1979-80, she gave the police 42 names of possible killers, and none of the names were Wayne or Williams. A man named Wayne B. Williams was eventually convicted of the crimes.         Ms. Allison became something of a cult figure after many newspaper articles and television shows depicted her as a great-grandmother sitting at her kitchen table, concentrating on astrological charts and gazing at gruesome photographs of crime scenes. Visitors to her house noticed many commendations from police departments, some of which officially say they do not use psychics.         She was born in Jersey City and grew up there. Her psychic sensations became public knowledge in 1968, when she told the Nutley police that they could find the body of a missing boy in a drainage pipe. Though it has been widely reported for three decades that they did, Mr. Nickell said that according to his research, the body was found floating in a pond by a man looking for a place to bury his dead cat.         In interviews over the years, Ms. Allison said she had worked on more than 5,000 cases, so many that she had trouble recalling the names of victims. She said she had led detectives to 250 bodies and had solved hundreds of murders. Among the police departments that consulted her was New York City's.         Chief DeLitta of the Nutley police said she had been helpful on many occasions, citing a 1993 bludgeoning murder. Among Ms. Allison's correct predictions were double letters in the names of the suspect and a street that figured in the case, the occupation of the suspect's father, and the facts that the suspect lived in a garden apartment next to a yellow house and that one of his car's headlights was out.         She also said the murder weapon would be found in a river. The weapon was never found, but the man convicted of the crime later admitted throwing it in the river, the chief said.         Ms. Allison refused payment for her work, saying it would be ''blood money.'' She did accept money for expenses and payments for appearances on talk shows and other forums. She also wrote articles and books, the most successful of which was ''A Psychic's Story,'' published in 1980.         She is survived by her husband, Bob; two sons, Alex Allison of Nutley and Robert McBride of Stone Ridge, N.Y.; a daughter, Dorothy McBride of Montville, N.J.; seven grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.         ''If you asked me if I believe in psychics, I'd say no -- only very few,'' Ms. Allison said in a New York Times interview in 1996.         She had harsh words for psychics who advertise on television, a practice she shunned. ''Those 1-900 number people should be arrested,'' she said.       
         Felicia Lamport, a poet and satirist who took delight in skewering the high and mighty with verse, quips, puns and parodies, most of them first appearing in a column in The Boston Globe called Muse of the Week in Review, died on Thursday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 83.         Ms. Lamport's column appeared in The Globe since 1981 but her work also appeared in The New Yorker, The Atlantic Monthly, Harper's and other publications.         Her first collection of poetry, ''Mink on Weekdays (Ermine on Sunday)'' (1950), became a best seller and was followed by other collections with titles like ''Scrap Irony'' (1961), ''Cultural Slag'' (1966) and ''Political Plumlines'' (1984).         She was born in New York and graduated from Vassar College in 1937, after which she worked as a reporter and wrote dialogue for MGM films.         She is survived by her husband, Benjamin Kaplan, a retired justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts; a son, James Kaplan of Northampton, Mass., a daughter, Nancy Mansbach of Newton, Mass.,  and four grandchildren.         She was particularly remembered for a work called ''The Love Song of R. Milhous Nixon,'' in which she borrowed from T. S. Eliot to lampoon President Nixon at the height of the Watergate scandal in 1973. It began:         Let us go then, in my plane,         For a weekend of repose in Key Biscayne;         When the view beneath our eyes appears unstable         Let us banish all incipient defeats         In one of my retreats.         Apart from political jabs, Ms. Lamport also turned her attention to the human comedy, with verse like:         The after-effects of a mother's neglects         May spoil her boy's orientation to sex,         But the converse is worse: if she overprotects,         The pattern of Oedipus wrecks. In April William Safire praised Ms. Lamport in The New York Times Magazine as ''the leading muse of the Deprefixers,'' which he defined as poets who achieve effects by dropping prefixes, for lines like ''Men often pursue in suitable style/ The imical girl with the scrutable smile.''       
         Janet Bode, the author of 14 nonfiction books with socially conscious themes for young adults, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich Village in Manhattan. She was 56.         The cause was breast cancer, said her companion of many years, Stan Mack, the cartoonist.         Ms. Bode's books were about interracial dating, teenage immigrants, rape, sibling rivalry, teenage parents, troubled love, friendship, eating disorders and other concerns of young people. Her literary technique, she explained to an interviewer in 1997, was to pick a topic resonant with meaning for teenagers, interview hundreds of young adults across the country and then present their comments verbatim.         Among her books were ''Death Is Hard to Live With,'' ''Voices of Rape'' and ''The Colors of Freedom'' (1999), a book addressed to teenage immigrants. Her books are not the kind usually reviewed by critics, but their value to troubled or perplexed young adults has been recognized by organizations like the American Library Association, which designated six of her titles Best Books for Young Adults.         Ms. Bode was born on July 14, 1943, in Penn Yan, N.Y., the daughter of the late Carl Bode, a professor of English and American Studies at the University of Maryland, and the former Charlotte Watkins Smith. She attended schools in London in the late 1950's when her father was cultural attache at the American Embassy there. She graduated from the University of Maryland in 1965.         In addition to Mr. Mack, Ms. Bode is survived by two sisters, Barbara, of Washington, and Carolyn, of Santa Monica, Calif.       
         Nilde Iotti, an early leader of the Italian Communist Party and the first woman to become president of the lower house of Parliament, died Friday night of heart failure after a long illness, the news agency ANSA reported. She was 79.         Ms. Iotti, who served as a Partisan during World War II, was first elected to office in 1946, winning a seat in the constitutional assembly. At age 26, she took part in the ''Committee of the 75,'' which wrote a first draft of Italy's postwar constitution.         From 1979 until 1992, she served as Italy's president of the lower house of Parliament, a role similar to that of the speaker of the house in the United States. It made her No. 2 in line to succeed the president.         In Parliament, her regal manner earned her the nicknames, ''Czarina'' and ''The Red Queen.'' She described herself differently, saying, ''I'm just a woman who has a difficult job and tries to do it with tact.''         The daughter of a railway worker, Ms. Iotti was born in Reggio Emilia, the heart of Italy's ''red belt'' and studied literature at the Catholic University of Milan. She moved to Rome after the war, where she met and fell in love with Palmiro Togliatti, Italy's Communist Party leader.         Mr. Togliatti was married, and divorce was then illegal in Italy. The couple adopted a daughter in 1950, the sister of a worker killed by police during a strike in Modena. The couple stayed together until Mr. Togliatti's death in 1964.         Viewed throughout her life as a staunch member of the Communist Party's central committee, Ms. Iotti changed along with many in her party after the collapse of the Berlin Wall. She was one of the first party officials to endorse the proposal to rid the party of its hammer and sickle and rename themselves ''Democrats of the Left.''         Ms. Iotti, who campaigned to legalize divorce and abortion in Italy, resigned from Parliament last month, citing ill health.         Her coffin will be laid in state in the Italian Parliament and she will receive a state funeral on Monday. She is survived by her daughter, Marisa Malagoli Togliatti.       
         Elizabeth Zimmermann, who brought a penetrating intellect and a sculptor's sensitivity to revolutionizing the ancient art of knitting, died Nov. 30 at a hospital in Marshfield, Wis., where she lived. She was 89.         Mrs. Zimmermann's best-known gift to knitting was a mathematical formula for figuring the proportions of sweaters and other garments, depending on how many stitches per inch the knitter wanted to use. But her passion, expressed in magazine columns, in four books and at her knitting camp, the nation's first, was creating beauty. She gently urged knitters to challenge the limits of their imaginations.         ''She allowed people to be intuitive about their knitting, rather than just being blind followers of the written word,'' said Nancy J. Thomas, editor of Knitter's Magazine. ''She had a way of being breezy and fun. She made everything seem easy.''         Linda Ligon, president of Interweave Press, which specializes in traditional textile crafts, said Mrs. Zimmermann ''brought intelligence and validity to a craft that had been trivialized as women's work.''         Elizabeth Lloyd-Jones was born near Devon, England, in 1910, the daughter of a naval officer and the woman who invented Meals by Motor, a British forerunner of Meals on Wheels. Her youthful memories, as recalled in ''Knitting Around'' (Schoolhouse Press, 1989), suggested a bucolic paradise, framed by plum trees and plum jam, governesses and private schools.         ''I had a wonderful hideyhole in a gone-to-seed cabbage patch,'' Mrs. Zimmermann said, ''and one day had the excitement and glory of falling through the roof of an abandoned chicken house, garnering the first permanent scar on my leg.''         The women of her mother's family knitted. One day, she asked her mother if she could try knitting, perhaps the most important words she ever uttered.         ''If you're good all day today, I'll teach you tomorrow,'' her mother answered.         Miss Lloyd-Jones attended art schools in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Munich, where she sold sweaters of her own design to a local shop for pocket money. She also met Arnold Zimmermann, a brewer. He had to flee Hitler's Germany because an SS agent overheard him making a snide remark about Hitler. They married in England, immigrated to New York and moved several times before settling in Wisconsin.         Mrs. Zimmermann began spending morning after morning with local knitters, exchanging tips. She became frustrated with many of her friends' lockstep reliance on precise instructions in printed patterns. So, in 1955, she submitted her designs for Norwegian-pattern sweaters to Woman's Day magazine, resolving to use clear language. Other magazines also accepted her designs, and in 1959, she started her own knitting publication.         About the same time, the family, with three children, moved into a derelict schoolhouse in the middle of the woods and remodeled it. She combined her newsletter with a mail-order business for knitting supplies, books and video productions under the name Schoolhouse Press.         She was hostess of a knitting program shown on many public television stations and in 1974 began a knitting camp under the auspices of the University of Wisconsin. The camp has continued every summer since. She also led workshops throughout the United States and in New Zealand.         Besides ''Knitting Around,'' her books included ''Knitting Without Tears'' (Scribner's/Macmillan, 1971), Knitter's Almanac (Scribner's/Dover, 1975) and ''Knitting Workshop'' (Schoolhouse Press, 1981).         She was a woman who held to strong principles about her work, like never using any thread but wool. But she never criticized another knitter's use of other materials, including the dreaded polyester. She developed a reputation for giving pithy advice.         ''A knitter's question which arises perennially,'' she wrote in Knitter's Almanac, ''is, 'How much wool should I buy?' ''         She said there was no blanket answer, but advised, ''If you are using very thick wool, buy more than you could possibly imagine; if you are using very thin wool, use surprisingly little.''         But Mrs. Zimmermann's larger influence was in design, making sweaters and other garments in round tubes, rather than in flat pieces to be joined together. The result was a sculptural quality, said her daughter Meg Swansen, who is also a noted knitter and will carry on her mother's business. By contrast, Kaffe Fassett, a knitter whose work is often exhibited in art galleries, is known for his painterly approach, she said.         But Ms. Ligon said sculptural effects were just the beginning. She said Mrs. Zimmermann's mathematical formula for constructing sweaters in the round freed knitters to concentrate on other creative concerns, like yarn and stitches.         ''She was more than a sculptor,'' Ms. Ligon said. ''She was an engineer.''         Many knitters said the system opened up new possibilities to them.  ''She made me a thinking knitter,'' said Joyce Williams of Sparta, Wis., who attended three knitting camps with Mrs. Zimmermann.         A woman from Reading, Mass., in an online customer review of ''Knitting Without Tears'' on Amazon.com, said: ''Elizabeth's wonderful instructions, comments and faith gave me the O.K. to go ahead and have fun. I made a patterned yoke sweater that not only looks great, but fits as well.''         In addition to Ms. Swansen, who lives in Pittsville, Wis., Mrs. Zimmermann is survived by her husband, Arnold; another daughter, Lloie, of Pittsville; a son, Thomas, of New Hope, Pa.; two grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.         Mrs. Zimmermann chose to play down her influence on knitting, coining the term ''unventions'' for her woolly inventions.         ''The products of science and technology may be new, and some of them are quite horrid, but knitting?'' she wrote in Knitter's Almanac. ''In knitting there are ancient possibilities; the earth is enriched with the dust of millions of knitters who have held wool and needles since the beginning of sheep.''
