        Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year.

Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year. Known for her dramatic power, Ms. Kaye, who was born in New York City in 1920, was a member of American Ballet Theater from its inception in 1940 until 1951, and again from 1954 to 1959. In between, she appeared with the New York City Ballet. Celebrated for her interpretations of the psychological ballets of Antony Tudor, she also danced in works by Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins.         The memorial included speeches by two ballerinas: Alicia Alonso, the Cuban dancer who was part of American Ballet Theater from 1940 until 1955, and Dame Margot Fonteyn, the former star of England's Royal Ballet. ''In her dance,'' Ms. Alonso said of Ms. Kaye, ''there was life always.'' Dame Margot called Ms. Kaye ''the most wonderful friend - understanding, perceptive, encouraging.''         Mr. Robbins analyzed Ms. Kaye's dramatic gift, saying that he believed she was theatrically striking not because she was flamboyant, but because of her gestural economy. Mr. Robbins recalled how last summer, while sitting at a cafe in Spoleto, Italy, he fancied he saw Ms. Kaye pass by.         Other tributes came from Leo Lerman, the theatrical writer; Mike Nichols, the director, and John Taras, Ballet Theater's associate director. Several speakers recalled how Ms. Kaye assisted her second husband, Herbert Ross, the choreographer and director, in his theatrical and film projects. Musical Tributes, as Well         Ms. Kaye had been married first to the violinist Isaac Stern. Mr. Stern was present to play Mozart's Violin Sonata in E minor, with Leonard Bernstein as pianist. Other musical selections included songs by Bernadette Peters and Barbara Cook. Leslie Browne and Robert Hill, of Ballet Theater, offered an excerpt from Tudor's ''Leaves Are Fading.''         The afternoon's touching conclusion came when Lynn Seymour, a British ballerina whose intensity has been likened to that of Ms. Kaye, danced Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan.'' When she stepped forward scattering rose petals, she could have been offering a floral tribute to Ms. Kaye.         Then, with Mr. Bernstein at the piano, Stephanie Friede sang ''Im Abendrot,'' one of Richard Strauss's ''Four Last Songs,'' which accompanied Tudor's ''Hail and Farewell,'' his last ballet for Ms. Kaye. It had been given its premiere by the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1959, with Ms. Kaye as guest artist; she retired in 1961. Possessing a theme that symbolized death and transfiguration, ''Im Abendrot'' sounded especially eloquent.

She was 76 years old, and had homes in New York City and Lenox, Mass.         Suzy Frelinghuysen, a former opera singer and a painter whose work is increasingly recognized by collectors and museums, died of a stroke on Saturday in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 76 years old, and had homes in New York City and Lenox, Mass.         An admirer of Juan Gris and Georges Braque, Ms. Frelinghuysen was best known for her paintings and collages of the 1940's, done in a synthetic Cubist style reminiscent of theirs, but with the formal elements manipulated in a highly personal manner. Ms. Frelinghuysen recently sold a work to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Born to a socially prominent New Jersey family in 1912, she was named Estelle Condit Frelinghuysen, but preferred the nickname Suzy, bestowed by her brothers. She attended Miss Fine's School in Princeton, and then studied voice. She married the abstract painter George L. K. Morris in 1935 Under the name of Suzy Morris, she won considerable acclaim for several seasons as a soprano with the City Center Opera, making her debut in ''Ariadne auf Naxos'' in 1947.         Ms. Frelinghuysen, whose husband died in 1975, is survived by a brother, Griswold Frelinghuysen, of Vermont.       
        Judith Somogi, one of the first women to become a conductor, died at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I., Wednesday morning. She was 47 years old and had suffered from cancer for four years.         Judith Somogi, one of the first women to become a conductor, died at Mercy Hospital in Rockville Centre, L.I., Wednesday morning. She was 47 years old and had suffered from cancer for four years.         Miss Somogi's early successes were at the New York City Opera, where she made her 1974 debut in ''The Mikado'' and ''La Traviata,'' thus becoming the company's first female conductor. Yet, the preponderance of her career was centered in Europe. Beginning in 1981, Miss Somogi became first Kapellmeister under Michael Gielen at the Frankfurt Opera and left there only last year with the departure of Mr. Gielen and the dismantling of his organization. Miss Somogi's last appearance was six months ago conducting ''Das Rheingold'' in Frankfurt.         She never returned to the New York stage after moving to West Germany. During her Frankfurt career, she presided over new productions of ''Il Turco in Italia,'' ''Un Ballo in Maschera,'' ''Tales of Hoffmann'' and ''Das Rheingold.'' Miss Somogi's American appearances during her European years were confined to productions at the Tulsa Opera. Joined City Opera in '66         She joined the City Opera in 1966 as a rehearsal pianist, spending her summers as assistant conductor to Thomas Schippers at the Spoleto Festival in Italy. There were also purely instrumental conducting appearances with the New York and Los Angeles Philharmonics and more opera with various regional companies across the United States.         At the time Miss Somogi was hired in Frankfurt, Mr. Gielen said: ''We took her because she was the best. Our orchestra has some old experienced hands who cannot be taught very much. Within five minutes she had them on the edge of their seats.''         Judith Somogi was born in Brooklyn of a Hungarian father and a Sicilian mother. She said she had gained valuable experience as a church organist and choir director in Lynbrook, L.I., and as a pianist, she went on earn two degrees at Juilliard. ''Conducting,'' Miss Somogi once said, ''is something you learn by doing.''         She is survived by her parents, Louis and Antonina, and by her sister, Jane, all of Lynbrook.

        Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Beatrice Cynthia Freeman Feinberg, who became a best-selling author of romance novels under the name Cynthia Freeman after beginning her writing career at the age of 50, died of cancer last Saturday at the University of California Medical Center in San Francisco. She was 73 years old.         Mrs. Feinberg was the author of nine novels including ''A World Full of Strangers,'' ''Fairytales,'' ''The Days of Winter,'' ''Portraits,'' ''Come Pour the Wine'' and ''Seasons of the Heart.'' Her books have been translated into 33 languages and sold more than 20 million copies.         Mrs. Feinberg was born on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, a child of German immigrants, and was brought up in San Francisco from the age of 6 months. She dropped out of school in the sixth grade and continued her education by auditing classes at the University of California at Berkeley. Seeking a Sedentary Pursuit         At 18, she married Dr. Herman Feinberg, who was her grandmother's physician. Subsequently Mrs. Feinberg became an interior decorator for 25 years, until a serious illness forced her to take up a more sedentary activity.         ''I'd been writing all my life - little things for Hadassah, plays for the Sisterhood,'' she said in a 1980 interview. ''I never thought of myself as a writer, but the simplest thing seemed to be to put a piece of paper in the roller and start typing.''         Her first novel was not published until she was 55. It took her four years to write ''A World Full of Strangers,'' chronicling four generations in the life of a Jewish family in the United States.         The novel was rejected by four houses before it was published in 1975 by the Arbor House Publishing Company. It sold 20,000 hard-cover books, ''a very respectable figure for a first novel,'' said Donald I. Fine, her first publisher, who edited her first six novels. The book went on to sell nearly 2 million copies in paperback. Explanation of Success         Although her books were not received enthusiastically by reviewers, they were immensely successful. Gilbert Millstein, writing in The New York Times Book Review, said about ''A World Full of Strangers'': ''It is soap opera - in this case, Jewish soap opera - and the audience for soap opera, in print or on televsion, Jewish or not, runs into the millions.''         ''The Last Princess,'' which was her final book, was published last April and will be brought out in paperback next spring. ''We know of no other book she was working on,'' said a spokesman for G. P. Putnam's Sons, which published her last three novels, all of them best sellers. Her Common Theme         A common theme of the novels was the struggle of Jewish immigrants to make themselves at home in the United States while holding true to their traditions. ''I'm very interested in the perpetuation of Jewish life,'' she once said. ''My own family is very close. I suppose that's why I'm drawn to family sagas.''         Mrs. Feinberg's husband died in May 1986, and her daughter, Arlene, died in an automobile accident in 1985.         Mrs. Feinberg is survived by her father, Albert C. Freeman of Atherton, Calif.; two sisters, Ruth Sevier of San Francisco and Helen Dwane of Redwood City, Calif.; a son, Sheldon, of Danville, Calif.; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

        Irmgard Seefried, a German-born Austrian soprano who gained great success in the postwar years in operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, died of cancer yesterday in Vienna. She was 69 years old.         Irmgard Seefried, a German-born Austrian soprano who gained great success in the postwar years in operas of Mozart and Richard Strauss, died of cancer yesterday in Vienna. She was 69 years old.         Though Miss Seefried spent most of her career with the Vienna State Opera, she sang frequently at Covent Garden in London, at La Scala in Milan and at music festivals in Salzburg, Edinburgh, Lucerne and elsewhere. She was also a respected recital and concert singer. She made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in November 1953, as Susanna in Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro'' - one of her signature roles.         Miss Seefried was born on Oct. 9, 1919, in Kongetried, a small town in Bavaria. Her father started to give her music lessons when she was a small child, and at the age of 11 she sang the role of Gretel in a performance of Humperdinck's ''Hansel and Gretel.'' She studied at the Augsburg Conservatory, and in 1939 joined the Aachen Opera at the invitation of Herbert von Karajan.         She made her Vienna State Opera debut in 1943, as Eva in Wagner's ''Meistersinger,'' and remained with the company until her retirement in 1980.         Miss Seefried made several concert tours of Europe, the United States and the Far East in the 1950's. In 1953, she and her husband, the violinist Wolfgang Schneiderhan, did a world concert tour together. 'Authority of Style'         From the start of her career, Miss Seefried was praised for the clarity of her voice and her appealing stage presence. Reviewing her Metropolitan Opera debut, Olin Downes wrote in The New York Times, ''The shining light of this performance was Miss Seefried, whose beautiful voice and brilliancy and authority of style won her instant recognition.''         During several seasons in the 1950's, she appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic-Symphony orchestra under the direction of Bruno Walter. Reviewing her 1956 performance of ''Et Incarnatus Est'' from the Mozart Mass in C minor, Howard Taubman said in The Times: ''The top of her soprano may not have the brilliance of some other singers, but she is an artist. She sang with warmth and tenderness and with a richness of understanding.''         Though her repertory came to include works by Hindemith, Poulenc, Berg and other modern composers, she was best known for her work in operas by Mozart, including Fiordiligi in ''Cosi Fan Tutte'' and Zerlina in ''Don Giovanni,'' and by Strauss, including Octavian in ''Der Rosenkavalier'' and the Composer in ''Ariadne auf Naxos.'' She also sang Marzelline in Beethoven's ''Fidelio.''         Miss Seefried recorded most of her operatic repertory and several albums of lieder.         She is survived by her husband and two daughters.
