         Josephine T. Moran, a former Westchester resident who was active in many civic organizations, died on Wednesday at her home in Boulder, Colo. She was 90.         She died of emphysema, said a son, Charles Moran 3d of Pelham, Mass.         Mrs. Moran was born in Manhattan and attended the Nightingale Bamford School and Smith College. From 1945 to 1975 she was involved in a range of volunteer activities in Westchester County and Connecticut.         They included the Children's Association, the Westchester County public schools, Grasslands Hospital, and the Rhodes Home in Westchester County, the Heritage Village Library, in Southport, Conn., and the Hitchcock Center, in Amherst, Mass.         Mrs. Moran's husband, Charles Moran Jr., died in 1978.         Besides her son Charles , she is survived by another son, David, of Boulder; a sister, Eva Taylor Holt of Manhattan, and four grandchildren.         Correction:  January 19, 1993, Tuesday         An obituary on Friday about Josephine T. Moran, a former Westchester resident who died on Wednesday in Boulder, Colo., misstated her age. She was 81.       
         Audrey Hepburn, the actress who epitomized Hollywood chic in the 1950's and 60's, died yesterday at her home in Tolochenaz, near Lausanne, Switzerland. She was 63 years old and had undergone surgery for colon cancer in November.         Her death from cancer was announced by Unicef, the United Nations Children's Fund, for which she had been a special ambassador since 1988.         In recent years, she made few movies, but traveled the world raising money and awareness for the U.N. organization. Her last screen role, in 1989, was a cameo as an angel easing the hero toward death in Steven Spielberg's "Always," a role in which the character's grace and serenity echoed the image Miss Hepburn had maintained throughout a 40-year career. An Oscar for a Princess         Her first major film role made her a star. In the 1953 romance "Roman Holiday," she played a princess who runs from her duties and falls in love with a journalist played by Gregory Peck. Audiences were enchanted by her combination of grace, elegance and high spirits, and she won an Academy Award as best actress.         The same year she won her Oscar, she won a Tony for her performance in the play "Ondine." Bosley Crowther, The New York Times critic, described her in words that characterized her youthful appeal. He called her "a slender, elfin and wistful beauty, alternately regal and childlike."         In a string of films that followed, she continued to play the lithe young thing with stars in her eyes and the ability to make Cinderella transformations. In "Sabrina" (1954), she was a chauffeur's daughter forced to choose between wealthy brothers, played by William Holden and Humphrey Bogart. In "Funny Face" (1957), opposite Fred Astaire, she played a bookstore clerk turned high-fashion model.         Descriptions of her beauty and appeal inevitably included the word "gamine." She was boyishly slender, with an aristocratic bearing, the trace of a European accent and a hint of mischief.  'A Wild-Eyed Doe'         Billy Wilder once recalled directing her in the 1957 film "Love in the Afternoon": "You looked around and suddenly there was this dazzling creature looking like a wild-eyed doe prancing in the forest. Everybody on the set was in love within five minutes."         Among her most popular and acclaimed roles was that of Holly Golightly, the backwoods beauty turned New York sophisticate in "Breakfast at Tiffany's" (1961).         At the height of her career, she worked with such directors as William Wyler and George Cukor and acted with the great male movie stars of her day, playing the younger woman opposite Gary Cooper ("Love in the Afternoon"), Cary Grant ("Charade," 1963) and Rex Harrison, in the 1964 movie version of "My Fair Lady."         There was some grumbling from the theater world when she was cast as Eliza Doolittle in "My Fair Lady," winning the role over Julie Andrews, who had originated it on Broadway. Ms. Hepburn's singing was dubbed in the film by Marni Nixon. The film won several Oscar nominations, but Miss Hepburn was not nominated. A Blind Woman Terrorized         Throughout her career, she also took on dramatic roles. She won an Oscar nomination for the title role of a woman questioning her vocation in "A Nun's Story' (1959). She played a woman enduring 20 years of an embattled marriage, opposite Albert Finney, in "Two for the Road" (1967). And she won her fifth Oscar nomination for her role as a blind woman terrorized in her own home in "Wait Until Dark" (1967).  Other nominations were for "Sabrina" and "Breakfast at Tiffany's."         After "Wait Until Dark," she left full-time acting and lived mostly in Switzerland.         Miss Hepburn returned to the screen occasionally. In "Robin and Marian" (1976) she played the middle-aged Maid Marian to Sean Connery's Robin Hood. The role was considered the triumph of her later career and a reflection of the graceful way the actress herself had moved into middle age.         She also made some poorly received films, including "Bloodline" (1979) amd "They All Laughed" (1981).         Miss Hepburn, whose name originally was Edda van Heemstra Hepburn-Ruston, was born on May 4, 1929, near Brussels, to a Dutch mother and an English father, and was educated largely in London. During World War II, she and her mother were caught vacationing in Holland when the Nazis invaded and her family endured much hardship during the occupation. During the war, one of her brothers was taken to a labor camp, and an uncle and cousin were executed. She once said the family was reduced to eating tulip bulbs. Spotted by Colette         But when she returned to London after the war, her life took the glamorous turn she would maintain for the rest of her life. She was a ballet student and model. On the Riviera, she was spotted by the author Colette, who insisted that Miss Hepburn star in the Broadway version of "Gigi," which led to "Roman Holiday."         She attributed her work with Unicef to her childhood experience of hunger and fear during the war.         As Goodwill ambassador for Unicef she traveled extensively in Africa and Latin America. She visited Ethiopia during the drought to call attention to the plight of starving children. In 1991 she described her Unicef role as "talking my head off," and said, "I just decided to do as much as possible in the time that I'm still up to it."         Last year she visited Somalia. It was shortly after returning from that trip that her cancer was diagnosed. With Frequent Appearances         Even in her last years she remained a visible presence in the film world. She received a tribute from the Film Society of Lincoln Center in 1991. She was a frequent presenter at the Academy Awards, and the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences recently announced that she and Elizabeth Taylor would receive the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award this year.         In 1954, she married the actor Mel Ferrer (with whom she later co-starred in "War and Peace.") They were divorced in 1968. In 1969 she married Andrea Dotti, an Italian psychiatrist, from whom she was later divorced.         Her companion since 1980 was Robert Wolders, a Dutch actor. She is also survived by two sons, Sean, from her marriage to Mr. Ferrer, and Luca, from her marriage to Dr. Dotti. The Sprite in Designer Clothing         Audrey Hepburn made her American stage and screen debuts in 1951, and two years later her gamin haircut, sylphlike shape and tomboyish but elegant demeanor in "Roman Holiday" made her a star and won her an Oscar. These are the plays and films in which she appeared.

         Diana Brewster Clark, an educator and an authority on dyslexia, died at her home in Manhattan on Sunday. She was 56.         Her daughter, Elise S. Pettus of Manhattan, said the cause of death was uterine cancer.         Dr. Clark was recognized for her research on remedial education for dyslexia. Her book, "Dyslexia; Theory and Practice of Remedial Instruction" (York Press, 1988), is a standard text on the subject.         In the preface to this work, Dr. Clark writes that despite considerable knowledge acquired over the last 50 years about the nature of dyslexia, a perception disorder that confuses images, it may be a long time before effective treatment is widely available. Instructional Methods         Noting that remedial practice "cannot afford to wait" for research, she presents a comprehensive study of existing instructional methods and programs for dyslexic students.         At the time of her death, Dr. Clark was an adjunct professor of education at Columbia University Teachers College and an active member of the Columbia Teachers College Alumni Council, of which she was moderator in 1988 and 1989. She was also a trustee of the New York City School Volunteers and a member of the Orton Dyslexia Society, the national advocacy group.         Dr. Clark, who was born in Manhattan, attended Vassar College and graduated from Barnard College in 1959. She received a doctorate in education from Teachers College at Columbia in 1984. Taught at Marymount         As a learning disabilities specialist, Dr. Clark taught the teaching of reading to children and young adults at the Nightingale-Bamford School and at the Communications and Learning Center of Marymount Manhattan College.         Her latest work was a chapter on early reading and instruction in the book, "Learning About Learning Disabilities" (Academic Press, 1991).         She was a board member of the Shaker Museum and the Columbia County Land Conservancy, both in Chatham, N.Y.         Two marriages, to Thomas W. Pettus and to James M. Clark, ended in divorce.         Besides her daughter Elise, Dr. Clark is survived by a daughter, Ashley S. Pettus, and a son, Brewster W. Pettus, both of Manhattan; two sisters, Whitney Armstrong and Janet York of Manhattan, and a brother, Benjamin Brewster, also of Manhattan.       
         Adina Blady Szwajger, a pediatrician who struggled to save young lives in the Children's Hospital in the Warsaw ghetto and survived to recount the horrors, died Feb. 18 in Lodz, Poland. She was 75 and lived in Warsaw.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, said Jerzy Warman, a friend in Manhattan.         When the Nazis finally shut the hospital Dr. Szwajger (pronounced SHVY-gher), despite her Jewishness, escaped the ghetto with special identity papers, then worked with the resistance.         After the war she resumed work as a pediatrician and occasionally spoke about her harrowing experiences. But she kept the most haunting episode a secret for decades, until she was ill and in retirement.         Her memoirs circulated in a Solidarity underground magazine in the mid-1980's, then were published in the West in 1988.  'Damning and Uplifting'         In a review of the Pantheon edition in The New York Times, Kati Marton said: "Dr. Szwajger's unsentimental, almost matter-of-fact memoir of the German occupation of Poland is the most damning and most uplifting of the many accounts of the Holocaust that I have read. I did not think the well-covered ground of Nazi atrocities could still astonish. 'I Remember Nothing More: The Warsaw Children's Hospital and the Jewish Resistance' proved me wrong."         Her story began with the high hopes of a young medical student from the University of Warsaw. She described herself as bubbling, happy and proud to help youngsters at the hospital.         But soon the hospital was filled with youngsters dying from tuberculosis, typhus and starvation. The Nazis occupiers sealed off the ghetto and eventually marched a steady stream of people to their deaths.         "So we tried to save them with those scraps of food, medicines and injections," she wrote. Some children revived enough to smile -- "except that this was the kind of smile that made your hair stand on end and your flesh crawl." She described "famished skeletons" fighting over the soup pot, spilling it and lapping the slop off the floor.  'Corpses and Living Together'         Every day she went to a square to looking for stray children, befriending a Ukrainian guard with vodka.         "Once he was talking to me when a little girl appeared at a window," she wrote. "He raised his gun, shot her and carried on talking to me. I picked up a child, said goodbye to him and walked away -- only I didn't know how to hold the child so that it wouldn't be hit if the Ukrainian shot at me."         At the hospital, toward the end, "corpses and living all lay together" as soldiers killed some patients and ordered others to the death camps. A nurse pleaded with Dr. Szwajger to inject the nurse's bedridden mother with a lethal dose of morphine.         The doctor agreed. She also decided -- and this secret she kept for 45 years -- to carry out euthanasia on some of the children. In the infants' ward, she spoonfed each of them a fatal dose of morphine.         "Just as, during those two years of real work in the hospital, I had bent down over the little beds," she wrote, "so now I poured this last medicine into those tiny mouths. And downstairs there was screaming because the Germans were already there, taking the sick from the wards to the cattle trucks." 'Why I Was Different'         She told the older children to get into bed, and "this medicine was going to make their pain disappear."         "So they lay down and after a few minutes ----," she wrote. "I don't know how many. But the next time I went into that room, they were asleep. And then I don't know what happened after that."         That memory never left, "and that's why I was always different from everybody else."         Dr. Szwajger's husband, a law student, was killed by the Nazis, who tricked him into turning himself in. Later she became pregnant by a man in the resistance. But she arranged an abortion, and also arranged abortions for three other women, because she was convinced that "children had no right to be born" into such a world.         Dr. Szwajger later married Wladyslaw Swidowski, who died several years ago. She is survived by two daughters, Hanna and Alina, four grandchildren and two great-grandchildren, all in Poland.       
         Barbara Redmond Ryan, a volunteer for social causes, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59.         Her husband, Allan A. Ryan 3d, said the cause of death was cancer.         Mrs. Ryan was a member of the women's committee of the Boys' Club of New York for 30 years and served on the club's board for 20 years. She was a co-founder of the committee's Homework Help program, which provides after-school counseling for underprivileged youth.         She was an active member of the Zoological Society of New York and of the New York Junior League, and a longtime organizer of Les Boutiques de Noel, which raises funds for Cancer Care, the Children's Aid Society and other organizations.         Mrs. Ryan, a native New Yorker, graduated from Vassar College in 1955.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Melissa and Sally, both of Manhattan; a son, Allan A. 4th, of Palm Beach, Fla.; her mother, Frances Jones Redmond of Essex, Conn.; a sister, Jean Cushing of Riverside, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Julia Davis Adams, a writer, died Saturday at Jefferson Memorial Hospital in Ranson, W. Va. She lived in Charles Town, W. Va., and was 92.         Her family attributed her death to natural causes.         Mrs. Adams, who was born in Clarksburg, W. Va., attended Wellesley College and graduated from Barnard College in 1922. She began her career as a reporter for The Associated Press in New York City, where she also headed the adoption service of the Children's Aid Society in the early 1960's.         She was the author of two dozen books, mostly novels. Writing as Julia Davis, she often dealt with the history of her native state and the role her family had played in it.         She also published reminiscences of the year she spent in London as the daughter of the United States Ambassador to Britain. Her father, John W. Davis, subsequently ran for President on the Democratic ticket, losing to Calvin Coolidge in 1924.         Her play, "The Anvil," was a re-creation of the trial of John Brown. Written as Charles Town's contribution to the Civil War centennial, it was an off-Broadway production in 1962.         Mrs. Adams was the last surviving member of her immediate family. She was married four times, twice to William M. Adams, her first and last husband, who died two years ago. She is survived by three daughters and four sons of her other husbands: Mary Eaton Kerns; Erin Healy Sheffield; Sister Benedict, a Roman Catholic nun; William Jones; Paul West Jr., Timothy Healy and Ramon Sender.       
         Sally A. Provence, professor emeritus in the Child Study Center and the Pediatrics Department at Yale University, died on Saturday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. She was 76 and lived at Branford.         The cause was cancer, said Dr. Albert J. Solnit, a longtime colleague.         For 35 years, Dr. Provence was director of the center's Child Development Unit. She retired in 1986. A pioneer in child development, both as a teacher and researcher, she documented young children's suffering and recovery from deprivation and trauma.         A founder and past president of the National Center for Clinical Infant Programs, she received many honors, including the C. Anderson Aldrich Award of the American Academy of Pediatrics.         Born in Wills Point, Tex., she graduated from the Baylor University College of Medicine. Among her many publications, she is best known for her book "Working with Disadvantaged Parents and Their Children" (Yale University Press, 1983).         She is survived by her companion and co-worker, Audrey Naylor of Branford, and a sister, Ada Belle Banta of Wills Point.       
         Lillian Gish, the last of the great silent film stars, who performed for more than 85 years in movies, theater and television, died in her sleep on Saturday evening at her home in Manhattan. She was 99 years old.         Her personal manager, James E. Frasher, said the cause was heart failure.         "She was the same age as film," Mr. Frasher said. "They both came into the world in 1893."         Miss Gish was still performing as recently as the late 1980's. In 1986, she appeared as Alan Alda's hilariously addled mother in "Sweet Liberty," and in 1987 she was widely praised for her sensitive portrayal of an indomitable old woman in "The Whales of August," which co-starred another movie legend, Bette Davis.  Advocate of an Early Start         "To become an actress, one cannot begin too soon," said Miss Gish, and she meant it, for she had made her acting debut at the age of 5.         Under the guidance of the director D. W. Griffith, Miss Gish became the pre-eminent actress in silent films, appearing in classics like "The Birth of a Nation," "Intolerance," "Broken Blossoms" and "Way Down East."         After performing in dozens of one- and two-reel silent movies (with running times of 10 or 20 minutes) and then in the longer Griffith epics, Miss Gish made a successful transition to the "talkies," and later into television.         Between film and television roles, she also worked on the stage. In 1930 she starred as Helena in Jed Harris's Broadway production of Chekhov's "Uncle Vanya," and in 1973 she appeared as the nurse in Mike Nichols's revival of the play. She made her last Broadway appearance in 1975, in "A Musical Jubilee."         Especially in her youth, Miss Gish evoked an aura of fragility, and hers was a vulnerable waiflike beauty. The renowned theatrical impresario David Belasco pronounced her "the most beautiful blonde I have ever seen." George Jean Nathan, the Broadway critic who courted Miss Gish without success for more than a decade, compared her to Eleonora Duse.         Miss Gish, though not always in excellent health, was accustomed to hard work and took a no-nonsense view of her physical attributes.         "I didn't care about being a beauty," she said in an interview in 1975. "I wanted to be an actress. When I was in the movies, I didn't care what I looked like, except for that image up there on the screen. I wanted to create beauty when it was necessary; that's an inner thing. But if all you have is a facade, it isn't interesting."         Throughout her life Miss Gish remained singularly devoted to her mother and to her sister, Dorothy, who was younger, but who became an actress at about the same time Lillian did. Mrs. Gish died in 1948 after a long invalidism, and Dorothy Gish died in 1968.         Miss Gish, who never married and who leaves no survivors, finally rejected Mr. Nathan's long series of marriage proposals, and said that a primary reason was his "seeming resentment" of her devotion to her family. She gave another reason for staying single: "Actresses have no business marrying. I always felt that being a successful wife was a 24-hour-a-day job. Besides, I knew such charming men: perhaps I didn't want to disillusion any of them."         Lillian Diana Gish, a daughter of the former Mary Robinson McConnell and James Gish, was born on Oct. 14, 1893, in Springfield, Ohio. The family moved to Baltimore, where Mr. Gish became a partner in a candy store. Before the turn of the century, he abandoned his wife and two daughters. He died in 1911.         Mrs. Gish took her daughters to New York City, rented an apartment on West 34th Street that was large enough to include two boarders, and began working in a department store. When Lillian was 5, a Gish boarder, an actress named Alice Niles, persuaded Mrs. Gish to let her take the child with her to act in a production of "In Convict's Stripes," which played one-night stands across the country. Lillian's salary was $10 a week.         At the age of 4, Dorothy joined another touring troupe; so did Mrs. Gish. The Gishes were separated at least half of each year, and life was lonely for Lillian as she traveled constantly and shared squalid hotel rooms with other company members to save money. More than once, she nearly fell into the hands of Elbridge Gerry's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, which was dedicated to protecting children who worked in sweatshop factories as well as on the stage.         When the Gishes were together in New York, they shared quarters with Charlotte Smith, whose daughter Gladys was a bit player on Broadway. Lillian won the role of a dancer, a part that Gladys had hoped for, in Sarah Bernhardt's 1905 engagement on Broadway. She Knew Pickford As Gladys Smith         In 1909, while visiting friends in Baltimore, Lillian and Dorothy dropped in to see a short film called "Lena and the Geese," and immediately recognized its star as Gladys Smith. The next year the sisters showed up at the Biograph film studios in Manhattan, at 11 East 14th Street, and asked to see Miss Smith.         That very day Gladys Smith, who had changed her name to Mary Pickford, introduced the Gishes to D. W. Griffith, who at that time was churning out at least three one-reelers a week for Biograph.         He took the sisters to a rehearsal hall, where he produced a revolver and began to shoot over their heads. He later explained that he wanted to see how they reacted. They evidently passed the fear test, for within hours they were playing small roles in "An Unseen Enemy." Each received $5.         That was the beginning of an artistic collaboration between Lillian Gish and Griffith that lasted more than a decade. During that time Miss Gish appeared in dozens of Griffith's short films and starred in most of his critically and economically successful longer ones.         In some films she played bit parts; in others, she played several roles. Sometimes she was the star. All of Griffith's Biograph actors were moved around in this way: it was not until after the success of "The Birth of a Nation" that any received on-screen credit. One Source of Pride: Doing Own Stunts         Miss Gish was proud of the fact that she became an accomplished horseback rider, and performed her own stunts in dangerous scenes. She also learned to edit film, set up lights and pick costumes, and she directed two films for Biograph, one of which starred her sister, Dorothy.         During most of her years with Griffith, Miss Gish and the rest of the Griffith company of actors and technicians divided their time between New York and Los Angeles. In 1913, when Griffith joined Mutual Productions, Miss Gish, her sister and many other artists at Biograph moved with him. Miss Gish starred in his first Mutual film, "The Battle of the Sexes," in 1914.         Securing financial backing for "The Birth of a Nation," a Civil War epic and a milestone in the history of the motion picture, was a major battle for Griffith, for the movie's costs constantly outstripped the budget estimates. It was said to have cost $300,000.         First released in February 1915, under the title "The Clansman," the film ran an unheard-of two hours and was shown at first in only a handful of road-show theaters, to the musical accompaniment of a 30-piece orchestra. Customers paid $2 to see what soon became known as "The Birth of a Nation." Despite the high admission price, the picture was a great hit.         "In it I played Elsie, the sweet and virginal daughter of the family around which the action was built," Miss Gish said in 1975. "I played so many frail, downtrodden little virgins in the films of my youth that I sometimes think I invented that stereotype of a role."         Miss Gish's role in Griffith's "Intolerance" (1916) was small. Griffith had envisioned the film as his ultimate contribution to the motion-picture art, but he was forced to trim it drastically on the insistence of his creditors. Many other stars of the day, including Constance Talmadge, Bessie Love and Erich von Stroheim, made brief appearances.  Propaganda Films For World War I         During World War I, the Gish sisters went with Griffith to Europe to make propaganda films, among them the immensely successful "Hearts of the World" (1918). By that time, Griffith had joined Adolph Zukor's company, which later became Paramount Pictures.         Hendrick Sartov, the still photographer for "Hearts of the World," eventually became a cinematographer for Griffith and invented for Miss Gish the "Lillian Gish lens," now called a soft-focus lens, which gives its subject a warmly blurred appearance.         In the fall of 1919, Griffith moved his entire company to Mamaroneck, N.Y., where he built his own movie studio on a huge estate. It was there, and on locations in New England, that he filmed Miss Gish's popular melodrama "Way Down East," released in 1920.         Miss Gish wrote in her autobiography that she volunteered to perform the dangerous climactic scene in that film, in which the heroine, lying on the ice floe in a freezing river, is headed for almost certain doom over a waterfall.         The frail-looking Miss Gish lay on the floe, her hair and one of her hands trailing in the frigid water. "My face was caked with a crust of snow and ice, and little spikes formed on my eyelashes, making it difficult to keep my eyes open," she recalled. "It was a delicious scene, one of my really favorites, but I remember being cold for days afterward."         "Orphans of the Storm," a French-Revolution melodrama released in 1922, was Griffith's last financially successful picture and, perhaps not coincidentally, the last Miss Gish made for him. "With all the expenses I have, I can't afford to pay you what you're worth," he told her. "You should go out on your own."         With heavy investments of her own money, she then made two successful movies in Italy, "The White Sister" and "Romola."         In the mid-1920's Miss Gish became embroiled in a long legal battle with Charles Duell, a socialite who had been her financial adviser (and, as she said in 1975, "sort of my Svengali"), over sums he claimed she owed him. Miss Gish munched carrots during the trial, and newspaper photographs of her stirred a carrot-chomping fad across the country.         Americans had become enchanted with the new artistic aristocracy, made up of movie stars like Mary Pickford, Douglas Fairbanks, Rudolph Valentino and Miss Gish. Earlier, in a movie, when Miss Gish had pushed up the sides of her mouth with her fingers to demonstrate feigned happiness, the gesture became a much-copied fad. From the Silents To the Talkies         Miss Gish made the transition from silents to talkies in 1930 in "One Romantic Night," with Rod LaRocque and Conrad Nagel. By that time, she had signed a contract with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. "My contract called for six pictures in two years, for which I was paid, I believe, a million dollars," she wrote.         Miss Gish made a triumphant return to the stage in 1930 in "Uncle Vanya" on Broadway. In 1936 she played Ophelia to John Gielgud's Hamlet and Judith Anderson's Queen Gertrude, and in 1941 she began a record-breaking 66-week run in "Life With Father" in Chicago. In 1960, she starred in "All the Way Home" on Broadway.         As Miss Gish grew older, roles were more difficult to come by, but she played in summer stock and in an occasional movie, like "The Comedians," "The Night of the Hunter" and "The Undefeated." An early recruit to television, she appeared in "Arsenic and Old Lace" with Helen Hayes and in Horton Foote's "Trip to Bountiful."         Commenting on what was to be Miss Gish's last screen performance, in the 1987 "Whales of August," Vincent Canby wrote in The New York Times: "There's not a gesture or a line-reading that doesn't reflect her nearly three-quarters of a century in front of a camera. Scenes are not purloined when she's on screen."         Correction:  March 2, 1993, Tuesday         A picture in some copies yesterday with an obituary of Lillian Gish, showing a scene from "Life With Father," was published in error. It showed Dorothy Gish.       
         Andrea Boroff Eagan, a journalist, educator, union founder and advocate for women, died on Tuesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 49 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         The interwoven themes of her career were social change, group action, women's rights, health and writing. Her causes grew from beliefs she formed as a campus activist in the turbulent protests of the 1960's.         In a celebrated moment during the Columbia University protests in 1968, she and Richard Eagan were unofficially married in a seized building. A chaplain pronounced them "children of the New Age." They were later legally married by that same chaplain.  Feminist Advice for Girls         Drawing on her personal experiences, Ms. Eagan wrote the first feminist advice book for teen-age girls, "Why Am I So Miserable, if These Are the Best Years of My Life?" (Lippincott, 1976). Later she wrote "The Newborn Mother: Stages of Her Growth" (Little, Brown, 1985), about the psychological changes in women after childbirth.         She also wrote many newspaper and magazine articles, mostly on health and women. She was the editor of the National Women's Health Network Series for Pantheon Books and president of Healthright, a nonprofit organization.         Ms. Eagan was active in local and national efforts for abortion rights and other health and women's issues. She taught about them at New York University and at La Guardia, Manhattan Community and Hunter Colleges.         From 1983 to 1987 she served as the founding president of the National Writers Union, which won contracts for freelance writers at several national magazines. She was also a founding board member of the Writers Room, Manhattan office space for writers free of distractions.         Ms. Eagan, who graduated from Columbia in 1969, reaffirmed her protest-era beliefs in a 1988 interview in The Washington Post: "The fact is, we were absolutely correct in what we perceived as being wrong. We were in error only in that we weren't successful."         Her survivors include her mother, Dorothy Boroff of Manhattan; her husband, Richard, and two daughters, Molly and Daisy, the Tony-award winning child actress in "The Secret Garden."       
         Claire Huchet Bishop, an author of popular children's books and a leading opponent of anti-Semitism, died on Thursday at her home in Paris at the age of 94. She had resided in Manhattan for about 50 years.         The cause of death was a hemorrhage of the aorta, said Mira Felner, a friend.         Mrs. Huchet Bishop began her career following in the footsteps of her grandfather and mother, noted storytellers in her hometown of Le Havre, France. She carried on that tradition in Paris and the United States, then began transcribing her stories. Many Translations         Her resulting books, which won several prizes, have appeared in a dozen languages, and some continue to be reprinted. Two were made into films. Her first book, "The Five Chinese Brothers" (Coward), is being translated to Spanish, 55 years after its original publication.         The persecution of Jewish friends in France in World War II prompted the second theme of Mrs. Huchet Bishop's life. She began writing for children and adults on spiritual issues and became an advocate in efforts for religious and racial harmony.         A Catholic, she was credited with helping win the deletion of anti-Semitic passages from the catechism with her analysis, "How Catholics Look at Jews" (Paulist Press, 1974). In a delegation visiting the Pope in the 1980's, she encouraged formal Vatican recognition of Israel.         She also served as the president of the International Council of Christians and Jews in 1975-77 and of the Jewish-Christian-Fellowship of France from 1968 to 1981.         Mrs. Huchet Bishop was born in Geneva. As a young woman, she discontinued her studies at the Sorbonne to devote more time to storytelling. In 1924 she opened France's first library for children, L'Heure Joyeuse (The Joyous Hour), and served as its director for five years.         She married Frank Bishop, an American concert pianist, and moved to the United States. She was in charge of the children's reading room at the New York Public Library in the mid-1930's and was the children's book editor of Commonweal.         After retelling a fable about Chinese quintuplets with superhuman powers, she decided to write down her version. That led to its publication and her career as an author of about 30 books. Two were runners-up for the Maybery Award, the highest honor for children's books, and she won other awards and citations.         Often her books had serious themes. "Pancakes-Paris" (Viking, 1947) was about food scarcity in wartime France. "Twenty and Ten" (Viking, 1952) told the true story of Christian French youngsters who hid their Jewish playmates from the Nazis. Wonderworks made it into a film, "Miracle at Moreau," for PBS television.         Her husband died in 1944.       
         Masha Tumarkin, who helped institute a new technique for teaching English to upwards of 50,000 recent immigrants in New York City, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 49 and was a Manhattan resident.         The cause of death was leukemia, her family said.         For several years she was the director of the English program for the New York Association for New Americans, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that aids in resettlement. She employed a system by which students start speaking in English within 12 weeks, when conventional methods often take many months longer. She supervised development of texts and curriculum and teacher retraining.         The concept, developed by her predecessor, Ira Goetz, features a fast-paced, question-and-answer format in which the teacher moves about the classroom from one student to another.         Born in Manhattan to Russian immigrants, Ms. Tumarkin grew up in a bilingual home with relatives and neighbors speaking in accents. After graduating from Columbia, she earned a master's at New York University in teaching English as a second language. She taught English at City College before joining the association in 1980.         Her marriage to Ethan Gologor ended in a divorce that drew publicity for a custody accord in which the children shuttled between the mother's and father's homes on alternating days.         Her survivors include her husband of a year, Richard Girard; two sons, Matthew Gologor of Oberlin, Ohio, and Benjamin Gologor of Manhattan; her mother, Suzanne Tumarkin of Manhattan, and a sister, Nina Tumarkin of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Mrs. Silverstone co-founded the Jerusalem center with her husband, the late Murray Silverstone, former president of 20th Century Fox International. Dedicated in 1960, the center was designed to be a place where Jewish and Arab children could learn about their own and other people's cultures.         On a visit to Israel in 1949, Mrs. Silverstone, aided by her three daughters, produced a film titled "The Magnetic Tide" about Jews and Arabs living together. The amateur film was distributed nationally by 20th Century Fox and the proceeds went to Children to Palestine, an interfaith group started to save Jewish children in Europe during World War II.         She was also a patron of the arts. She was founder-director of the Scarsdale Cultural Center and regularly opened her gardens in Scarsdale for benefit concerts.         Mrs. Silverstone, who was born Dorothy Littman in Brooklyn, returned to school after her husband's death in 1969, receiving a bachelor's degree from Fordham University in 1984.         She is survived by three daughters, Marilyn Silverstone of Katmandu, Nepal, Barbara Garrison of Manhattan and Susan Darer of Beaconsfield, England; a brother, Dr. Leon Littman of Manhattan; four grandchildren and a great-grandson.       
         Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won several Emmy awards for her work on Olympics broadcasts for ABC Sports, died yesterday at her home in West Tisbury, Mass. She was 63 and also lived in Vail, Colo.         The cause of death was cancer of the uterus, said her son, Robert P. Riger of Manhattan.         In 1973, Ms. Sanger became one of the first female producers in network television sports when she was hired by ABC to develop women's programs. Over the next decade, she produced dozens of programs for the network, including parts of Olympic broadcasts from Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984.         She left ABC in 1985 and moved to London, but continued working part-time for the network and also produced programs for other organizations. She was a member of several professional groups and also was an adjunct lecturer in the media arts department at the University of Arizona.         Ms. Sanger was born Sept. 15, 1929, in Hong Kong and attended Smith College before earning a master's degree in public law and government at Columbia University. Before joining ABC Sports, she worked for several other television and news organizations.         In addition to her son, she is survived by three other children, Christopher Riger of Myrtle Beach, S.C., Victoria Riger Phillips of New Orleans, and Charlotte Riger Hull of West Tisbury, Mass.; a sister, Helen Sanger of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.         Correction:  March 9, 1993, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won Emmy awards for sports broadcasts, misidentified one of her residences. It was Vail, Ariz., not Colorado.       
         May Friend Goodman, who served for two decades as a representative of a leading international Jewish organization at the United Nations, died on Friday at her home in Cedarhurst, L.I. She was 85.         She died of heart failure, a family member said.         In 1952, Mrs. Goodman began her association as a nongovernmental representative at the United Nations through the World Union of Progressive Judaism. As a representative, she attended meetings of the Economic and Social Council and was an accredited spokeswoman for the World Union of Progressive Judaism. The World Union is the international body of Reform, Progressive, Liberal, and Reconstructionist Jews linking 1.5 million people in more than 20 countries.         Mrs. Goodman, who was born and educated in Chicago, graduated in 1930 from the University of Chicago. She wrote a number of plays for children sponsored by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. She also wrote book reviews for Chicago publications. She was married to Rabbi Abram Vossen Goodman, now rabbi emeritus of Temple Sinai of Long Island.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Gail G. Schulhoff of Baltimore, and Judith G. Richter of Merion, Pa., and four grandsons.       
         Rachel Davis DuBois, an educator who 60 years ago developed multicultural programs promoting respect for ethnic heritage and harmony between groups, died Tuesday at a hospital near her home in Woodstown, N.J. She was 101.         Counter to the philosophy of the time that promoted ethnic assimilation, Dr. Dubois was among the few educators preaching that differences should be celebrated. Her work drew on her own Quaker background and her discovery of children in southern New Jersey who felt inferior and ashamed of their Italian heritage.         "With the diversity of religious and racial groups in this country, tolerance and understanding demand some appreciation of the group contributions in culture," she said in 1933.         Dr. DuBois wrote books and founded several private groups: the Inter-Cultural Education Workshop, Fellowship Farm, Workshop for Cultural Democracy, Livingroom Gatherings and the Atlanta Dialogue Center. Festivals With a Purpose         She developed a widely copied technique called group conversation that uses a common experience, like spring festivals, for people to learn about each other's customs, which often prove similar.         At New York City schools, she organized festivals on the music, dance and food of different cultures and presented plays portraying friction and harmony.         For the U.S. Education Department, she developed a radio series, "Americans All, Immigrants All," in 1940. In 1951 the State Department sent her to Germany to work with peoples resettled after World War II.         She was involved in peace and civil rights efforts and worked with Martin Luther King Jr. and Margaret Mead, among others.         A native of Clarksboro, N.J., she graduated from Bucknell University and received a doctorate at Columbia. She taught there and at New York University. Her husband, Nathan, died in 1915.       
         Rachel Higgins Everson, a civic leader and volunteer worker in Brooklyn for a half-century, died on Wednesday at the age of 91 at Southport Manor in Southport, Conn. A longtime resident of Brooklyn Heights, she had lived in Westport, Conn., in recent years.         The cause of death was a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Everson, known as Peggy, started as a volunteer at Colony South Brooklyn Houses, a settlement house, in 1924, the year of her marriage to Alfred Hall Everson. She served on many committees to enhance neighborhood life into the 1970's.         She was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Charles M. Higgins, the inventor of liquid India ink. She was a 1922 graduate of Vassar College, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa.         Mrs. Everson was a past president, chairwoman, board member or officer of Brooklyn's first Planned Parenthood committee, the Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service, United Neighborhood Houses of New York, Colony House, the Brooklyn Central YWCA, Civitas, the Brooklyn Tuberculosis and Lung Association, the Brooklyn Women's Club, the Brooklyn chapter of the American Red Cross, and the Brooklyn division of the Protestant Council of the City of New York, among others.         In interviews, Mrs. Everson said she wanted to help those who were less fortunate than she had been, especially to give children a more promising future.         Mrs. Everson's husband, an engineer and executive in her father's Higgins Ink Company, died in 1969. She is survived by a daughter, Ann Everson of Westport; four sons, John, of Westport, Peter, of Norwalk, Conn., Robert, of Edmond, Okla., and Alfred Jr., of Palm City, Fla., and eight grandchildren.

         Marian Anderson, whose velvety contralto and dignified, affecting stage manner melted the hearts of music lovers around the world, and whose determination helped shatter racial barriers in the arts, died yesterday in Portland, Ore. She was 96.         She died at the home of her nephew, the conductor James DePreist. Lee Walter, a friend of the singer, gave the cause as congestive heart failure a month after a stroke.         Miss Anderson's achievements, which inspired generations of young black performers, included a concert before 75,000 listeners at the Lincoln Memorial in 1939 arranged by Eleanor Roosevelt after the Daughters of the American Revolution denied the singer the use of the concert hall in their national headquarters. And when she made her Metropolitan Opera debut in 1955, she became the first black singer to perform there.         The soprano Leontyne Price, one of the first artists to benefit from Miss Anderson's efforts, said yesterday, "Her example of professionalism, uncompromising standards, overcoming obstacles, persistence, resiliency and undaunted spirit inspired me to believe that I could achieve goals that otherwise would have been unthought of."         In 1989, when a group of musicians that included Isaac Stern, Jessye Norman and Julius Rudel put together a concert to raise money for the Marian Anderson Award, a prize given to young singers as an honor to its namesake, Donal Henahan wrote in The New York Times, "Miss Anderson's place as a high priestess of American musicians, whatever their color, is not to be denied." Bigotry on a Daily Level         But Miss Anderson had to fight hard to win her place in American music history. Although she won first prize in a voice contest in New York in 1925 and made an appearance that year with the New York Philharmonic at Lewisohn Stadium, she was unable to find operatic engagements, and within a few years her career came to a standstill. It was only after she toured Europe to great acclaim in the early 1930's that the American public began to pay attention to her.         Even after her artistry was recognized in her homeland, she faced racial prejudice on a more mundane level. Well into her career, she was turned away at restaurants and hotels. Even America's opera houses remained closed to her until Rudolf Bing invited her to sing at the Met near the end of her career.         Because opera was denied her for most of her career, Miss Anderson's reputation rests on the considerable communicative power that she brought to the recital stage. Her manner -- closed eyes, very few gestures -- conveyed stateliness and inner serenity. And her repertory covered considerable ground, from Bach and Handel oratorio selections to Schubert, Brahms, Schumann and Rachmaninoff songs, Verdi arias and spirituals.         Her recordings of standard concert works, most notably Schubert's "Ave Maria," were prized for the radiant beauty of her interpretations. But one of her real achievements was in emphasizing that spirituals deserved a place in the active repertory, something she demonstrated with sublime readings of "My Lord, What a Morning" and "Crucifixion," which were the centerpieces of many programs.  Sang at Age 3         "They are my own music," she once said. "But it is not for that reason that I love to sing them. I love them because they are truly spiritual in quality; they give forth the aura of faith, simplicity, humility and hope."         During her career, Miss Anderson gave her date of birth as Feb. 17, 1902, but June Goodman, a longtime friend of hers, said that while going through some family papers recently, she found Miss Anderson's birth certificate, which gave the date as Feb. 27, 1897. Miss Anderson was born in Philadelphia, the oldest of three children. Her father died when she was a child, and her mother took in laundry to support the family. She began singing when she was 3 years old; when she was 6 she joined the choir at the Union Baptist Church and impressed the director by learning all the parts -- soprano, alto, tenor and bass -- in the hymns the choir sang.         She did not have her first formal lessons until she was 15 and began studying with Mary S. Patterson. Her church choir raised money to pay for her lessons, and the Philadelphia Choral Society, a black ensemble, gave a benefit performance to support further studies with Agnes Reifsnyder and Giuseppe Boghetti.         In 1925, Mr. Boghetti entered his pupil in a New York Philharmonic voice competition, in which she competed with 300 singers and won first prize. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic on Aug. 27, 1925, and was immediately signed by a concert manager. But after a Town Hall recital and a handful of concerts, her engagements dwindled. By 1930, she decided to go to Europe, not only in search of performance opportunities, but in the hope of perfecting her command of languages and devoting further study to the art of lieder singing.         Her performances in Europe were great successes. During a Scandinavian tour in 1930 she met the composer Jean Sibelius, who spoke glowingly of her voice and dedicated the song "Solitude" to her. And when she ended a 1935 tour in Salzburg, Arturo Toscanini told her, "A voice like yours is heard once in a hundred years."  Persuaded to Return         The impresario Sol Hurok heard Miss Anderson sing in Paris that same year, and offered to present her in another Town Hall recital. She had misgivings, having received so much more enthusiastic a reception in Europe than in the United States. But Mr. Hurok persuaded her, and he remained her manager for the rest of her career.         Miss Anderson's return to Town Hall on Dec. 30, 1935, was the success that Hurok told her it would be. "Let it be said from the outset," Howard Taubman wrote in The Times, "Marian Anderson has returned to her native land one of the great singers of our time."         In the late 1930's, she gave about 70 recitals a year in the United States. But her fame did not entirely eradicate the prejudice she confronted as a young black singer touring the United States. It was a particularly unfortunate display of that prejudice, however, that helped make Miss Anderson a household name. In 1939, Hurok tried to book her at Constitution Hall in the national headquarters of the D.A.R., and was told that all dates were taken.         When Hurok took his singer's case to the public, Eleanor Roosevelt, the First Lady, resigned from the D.A.R., and other prominent women followed suit. Harold L. Ickes, the Secretary of the Interior, offered Miss Anderson the Lincoln Memorial for a concert on Easter Sunday 1939. Some 75,000 people attended the concert, and millions more listened to the radio broadcast. Photographs and films of Miss Anderson singing in front of Lincoln's statue, before the enormous crowd, quickly became a poignant symbol for the nascent civil rights movement.  Noncombative Personality         During the dispute, Miss Anderson maintained the quiet dignity for which she was famous. Refusing to comment or to express any rancor when reporters pressed her for a response, she later wrote in "My Lord, What a Morning," her memoir, "I particularly did not want to say anything about the D.A.R. As I have made clear, I did not feel that I was designed for hand-to-hand combat."         Four years later, the D.A.R. invited Miss Anderson to take part in a China Relief concert at Constitution Hall. "When I finally walked onto the stage of Constitution Hall," she said later, "I felt no different than I had in other halls. There was no sense of triumph. I felt that it was a beautiful concert hall and I was very happy to sing there."         Miss Anderson continued to tour as a recitalist, but made no headway in the opera world until Mr. Bing invited her to sing Ulrica in Verdi's "Ballo in Maschera." She made her debut on Jan. 7, 1955.         "The curtain rose on the second scene," Miss Anderson said later about the evening, "and I was there on stage, mixing the witch's brew. I trembled, and when the audience applauded and applauded before I could sing a note, I felt myself tightening into a knot."         It did not matter that at 57 she was past her vocal prime. As Howard Taubman noted in his review in The Times, "men as well as women were dabbing at their eyes" during the tumultuous ovation. Toured for State Department         In 1957, the State Department sponsored a 10-week tour of India and the Far East in which Miss Anderson sang 24 concerts in 14 countries. A CBS News crew accompanied her, and the film was used in "The Lady From Philadelphia," a program in Edward R. Murrow's "See It Now" series.         She sang at President Dwight D. Eisenhower's inauguration in 1957, and at President John F. Kennedy's in 1961, and later that year for American troops in Berlin. She toured Australia for the first time in 1962, and in October 1964 began her farewell tour, at Constitution Hall, and gave her last recital at Carnegie Hall on April 18, 1965. She made occasional stage appearances in the 1970's, as the reader in Aaron Copland's "Lincoln Portrait."         Late in her life Miss Anderson was frequently honored. She was given a Presidential Medal of Freedom in 1963, and in 1978 was in the first group of artists to receive Kennedy Center Honors. In 1980, the United States Treasury Department coined a half-ounce gold commemorative medal with her likeness, and in 1984 she was the first recipient of the Eleanor Roosevelt Human Rights Award of the City of New York. In 1986, President Ronald Reagan awarded her the National Arts Medal.         Miss Anderson married Orpheus H. Fisher, an architect, in 1943; he died in 1986. They had no children. The singer spent her retirement at her farm, which she named Marianna, in Danbury, Conn., and although in her last years she had to use a wheelchair, she was occasionally seen at concerts in New York City. In July 1992 she moved to Portland to live with her nephew, Mr. DePreist, who is her only survivor.         In the late 1950's, when Miss Anderson began to wind down her singing career, she pursued several other interests. President Eisenhower appointed her an alternative representative in the United States delegation to the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations. She gave benefit concerts for the Congress of Racial Equality, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the America-Israel Cultural Foundation. And she sang again at the Lincoln Memorial in 1963, during the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.         She also made a point of helping young singers, particularly through the Marian Anderson Awards, which she started when the city of Philadelphia awarded her the $10,000 Bok Prize in 1943. Eventually the prize fund ran out of money, but since its re-establishment in 1990 it dispenses $25,000 annually. She was also associated with Young Audiences, an organization that presents school concerts with professional musicians.         In addition to direct involvement and encouragement, she was also, of course, a role model for the black musicians who followed her.         "At age 10 I heard, for the first time, the singing of Marian Anderson on a recording," the soprano Jessye Norman once said. "I listened, thinking, 'This can't be just a voice, so rich and beautiful.' It was a revelation. And I wept."       
         Minnie L. Gentry, a stage and television actress, died at her home in Manhattan on Tuesday. She was 77.         Ms. Gentry, whose given name was Minnie Lee Watson, was born in Norfolk and grew up in Cleveland, where she sang in church choirs and performed in operettas. Through Lloyd Gentry, whom she later married, she joined the Gilpin Players, one of the first acting companies at the Karamu Playhouse, in Cleveland, where she was a featured performer in dramatic, musical and operatic roles for 30 years.         In 1946, Ms. Gentry came to New York and appeared in a Broadway production of "Lysistrata" with Sidney Poitier. She returned to the Karamu Playhouse three years later and performed there until 1961, when she came back to New York and appeared in "The Blacks" and "Amen Corner," among other plays. Plays With Racial Themes         In the late 60's and early 70's, Ms. Gentry appeared in several plays that dealt with race relations, notably "Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death," "Black Girl," "Georgia, Georgia," and "The Gentleman Caller," one of the four plays in "A Black Quartet." She also appeared in "The Sunshine Boys," "All God's Chillun Got Wings" and in the title role of an Off-Broadway production of "Medea." In 1979, she won critical praise for her performance as Lena Younger in a revival of "Raisin in the Sun" at the Henry Street Settlement.         Her many television roles included Aunt Bessie on the soap opera "All My Children" and, most recently, Gram Tee on "The Cosby Show."         She appeared in small roles in movies, including "Come Back Charleston Blue" (1972), "The Brother From Another Planet" (1984) and "Jungle Fever" (1991).         She is survived by a daughter, Marjorie Hawkins of Manhattan, three grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren, and three great-great-grandchildren.       
         Joan Sperry Rader, who was active for two decades in the Republican Party in Connecticut, died on Friday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 58.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, William Donald Rader.         Mrs. Rader, who had lived in Greenwich since 1965, was a real-estate broker and longtime school trustee. She was elected in 1989 to a two-year term as the vice chairwoman of the Republican State Central Committee of Connecticut, becoming its highest-ranking female officer. She was re-elected to a second, successive term and held the office at the time of her death.         Her many volunteer activities over the years included serving as a trustee of the Eagle Hill School in Greenwich, a private day and boarding school for learning-disabled children and teen-agers. A Brooklyn Native         Since 1981 she had been a real-estate broker with Douglas, Elliman Pickering Associates in Greenwich.         Mrs. Rader was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Edward G. Sperry, who was for some years president of the Sperry Products Company, which manufactured railroad and subway track-testing equipment and other products in Connecticut and on Long Island, and the former Mary Elizabeth Garvin, who was a company director.         She grew up in Oyster Bay, L.I., and graduated in 1956 from Vassar College, where she majored in economics. In 1958 she married Mr. Rader.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Rader is survived by three daughters, Judith Anne, of Boston, Jennifer Caroline, of Springfield, Ohio, and Elizabeth Rader Edwards of Riverside, Conn.; two sisters, Judith Sperry Beavers of Old Greenwich, Conn., and Joy Sperry Emery of Ballston Lake, N.Y., and a granddaughter.       
         Dame Freya Stark, a resourceful and scholarly travel writer who was the first Westerner to journey through many regions of the Middle East, died on Sunday at her home in Asolo in northeast Italy. She was 100..         Dame Freya, who was born in Paris and grew up in several homes in England and Italy, wrote 24 travel books and autobiographies and eight volumes of letters from the 1930's to the 1980's. Many of the books have been reprinted several times, recently by Transatlantic Arts and Overlook Press, among other houses, and were based on often hazardous journeys by vehicle, camel and donkey.         Dame Freya's books about the Middle East and nearby countries were called lucid, spontaneous and elegant and were lauded for imparting an inspired sense of both history and people. The consensus of reviewers was that she wrote with spirit, authority and humor and that she was a consummate traveler because of her fearlessness, candor, charm, idealism and streak of naivete.         In a foreword to "The Journey's Echo: Selections From Freya Stark" (1964), the writer Lawrence Durrell praised her as a "poet of travel" and "one of the most remarkable women of our age." Many Languages and Dialects         Dame Freya was essentially self-taught. In her youth, she became fluent in Arabic and Turkish, and over the years she mastered other languages and many dialects. It was a talent that served her well in the course of a venturesome life as reflected in the titles of her books: "Baghdad Sketches" (1933 and 1937), "The Valleys of the Assassins and Other Persian Travels" (1934, 1972 and 1978), "The Southern Gates of Arabia: A Journey in the Hadhramaut" (1936 and 1972), "A Winter in Arabia" (1940, 1972 and 1987), "Letters From Syria" (1942), "The Freya Stark Story" (1953), "Alexander's Path" (1958 and 1988) and "Gateways and Caravans: A Portrait of Turkey" (1971).         Freya Madeline Stark was born in Paris on Jan. 31, 1893, to Robert Stark, a British sculptor, and Flora Stark, a painter and pianist. Her parents separated in her childhood, and her formal education was mainly at the University of London and the nearby School of Oriental and African Studies.         In World War I she was a nurse in Italy, and in World War II she worked for the British Information Ministry, earning prominence and honors for enhancing British influence and countering Axis propaganda in Aden, Yemen, Egypt, Iraq and India. In Cairo, she founded the Brotherhood of Freedom, a democratic anti-Fascist movement.         Years later, she observed that Britain eventually lost India and prestige throughout the Middle East because of "a lack of clearness and faith in our own values." Honors and Godchildren         She was awarded a Cross of the British Empire in 1953 and was named a Dame of the British Empire in 1972.         In 1947, when she was 54, she married Stewart Perowne, a diplomat and historian. They separated in 1952 but did not divorce. Mr. Perowne died in 1989. They had no children, but Dame Freya had many godchildren, in many countries.         One godson, Malise Ruthven, wrote a 144-page tribute, "Traveler Through Time: A Photographic Journey With Freya Stark," which was published in 1986. In the book, he observed: "Freya never lost her passion for acquiring fresh knowledge and new skills. Writing, like travel, she saw as the pursuit of truth."         At 93, as she was planning a trip to Spain, Dame Freya was asked about death. She replied, "I feel about it as about the first ball, or the first meet of hounds, anxious as to whether one will get it right, and timid and inexperienced -- all the feelings of youth."       
         Anne M. Johnson, a former vice president of Beginner Books, a children's book division of Random House, died on Sunday at her home in Clifton, N.J. She was 62.         She had a brief illness, said Robert L. Bernstein, with whom she had worked at Random House.         Mrs. Johnson, a native of Staten Island, graduated from Hunter College and briefly worked for Doubleday & Company before joining Random House in 1956 as a secretary. The following year she began to work with Mr. Bernstein. From 1966 she was the assistant to the chairman and president while Mr. Bernstein held those positions at Random House.         At Beginner Books, she worked closely with Theodor S. Geisel, the star author for that imprint known as Dr. Seuss. She was a board member of the Dr. Seuss Foundation.         Mrs. Johnson was the widow of Hugh Johnson, executive vice president of Hammond Publishing, who died in 1987.       
         Vera, the artist and designer whose name has been emblazoned on brightly printed scarves, bed and table linens, draperies and sportswear for nearly 50 years, died on Tuesday at Phelps Memorial Hospital in North Tarrytown, N.Y. She was 84 and lived in Ossining, N.Y.         The cause was cardiac arrest after surgery, said Tom Costello, a friend and business associate.         Vera Neumann, who used only her first name professionally, was a painter whose work was exhibited in many countries, and her designs typically began as paintings. For motifs, she preferred flowers, leaves, ferns, grass, vegetables, the sun and ladybugs. A "ladybug means good luck in every language," she said.         She introduced the first signature scarf in the late 1940's. Another trend she started was to offer collections saluting the countries she visited in her frequent travels, including Brazil, Denmark, Finland, India and Portugal. A Taste for Purity         Vera's style could be realistic or abstract. Her penchant for purity could mean a scarf or place mat printed in one color at a time when other designers might have used a dozen.         "If you have too many colors," she explained, "you could easily get tied down to just one color scheme that can't be changed." A shy, private person, she did not like to make speeches. "Color is the language I speak best," she said.         Vera was born in Stamford, Conn., and took night classes at Cooper Union, which honored her with its Outstanding Alumna Award. She was a designer of children's furniture and murals when she met and married George Neumann. They and a third partner, F. Werner Hamm, each risked $1,000 in 1946 to start a business. Its first order, from B. Altman, was for three place mats, made of parachute silk and hand-delivered by Mr. Hamm.         The enterprise prospered. By 1977, Vera designs were sold in more than 1,200 stores, with sales of more than $100 million. The company had been bought 10 years earlier for $5 million by Manhattan Industries and has been a division of Salant Corporation since 1988. Vera Companies -- Scarves by Vera and Linens by Vera -- has showrooms on Fifth Avenue, and Vera herself continued to supply designs until several months ago.         Vera's husband died in 1960. She is survived by her daughter, Evelyn Fyler of Ossining; her son, John Neumann of Carmel, N.Y, and four grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Steinway Chapin, a member of the New York State Council on the Arts and a volunteer for many other cultural organizations, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was bone cancer, said her husband, Schuyler G. Chapin, who is dean emeritus of Columbia University's School of the Arts and a former general manager of the Metropolitan Opera.         Mrs. Chapin was a scion of the piano-making Steinway family. She had been on the Arts Council, which administers grants to arts organizations, since 1978. At her death, she was also the senior trustee of the Harlem School of the Arts.         She retired recently as chairman of the Alliance of Resident Theaters-New York, and from the boards of the Professional Children's School and the New York Revels. In addition, she had been a trustee of the Dalton School, where she was also employed for many years, in a variety of positions. Libraries' Benefactor         In 1971, Mrs. Chapin created a group that became the Volunteers of the New York Public Library. She also served as co-chairwoman of the Committee for the Library of the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.         In 1975 she became a founding member of the Citizens Committee for New York City, which was formed to help the city during its fiscal crisis.         Mrs. Chapin was born in Plymouth, Mass., grew up in Manhattan, attended Dalton and Concord Academy in Concord, Mass., and graduated in 1945 from Radcliffe College. In addition to her husband of 46 years, she is survived by four sons, Henry B. of Manhattan; Theodore S. of Manhattan; Samuel G. of Hingham, Mass., and Miles W. of Manhattan; eight grandchildren; two brothers, Henry Z. Steinway of Manhattan and Frederick Steinway of Amherst, Mass., and a sister, Lydia G. Cochrane of Chicago.       
         Pat Nixon, the quiet consort who stood by her husband, Richard M. Nixon, in the White House and out, through victory, defeat, sorrow and illness, died yesterday at their home in Park Ridge, N.J. She was 81.         Mrs. Nixon, who had been ill for several years, died of lung cancer, said Kim Taylor, a spokeswoman for the Nixon family.         She said former President Nixon and the Nixons' two daughters, Tricia Nixon Cox and Julie Nixon Eisenhower, were with Mrs. Nixon when she died at 5:45 A.M. She also said that Mr. Nixon, who visited Russia in February and China in April, was "in excellent health as evidenced by his recent travel schedule."         Commenting on Mrs. Nixon's death, former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger said, "Pat Nixon was an extraordinarily supportive First Lady, particularly good in her judgment of people."         Former President Ronald Reagan issued a statement that Mrs. Nixon was "a pillar of great strength during a time of turmoil." Dislike of Politics         On the eve of Richard Nixon's inauguration as President in 1969, Pat Nixon was asked if she had ever encouraged her husband to enter politics.         "No," she replied. "I did not. Politics was not what I would have chosen for him because, after all, you don't see as much of your husband as you would like and it's a hard life."         But, she went on, Mr. Nixon was convinced that politics was his duty.         "What could I do?" she said.         What Mrs. Nixon did was subjugate her instinct for privacy and homemaking and become her husband's faithful companion in his turbulent years in the political arena, from the happy early years after his election as United States Representative from California in 1946 until his humiliating resignation as President of the United States in August 1974, under the shadow of impeachment proceedings that grew out of the Watergate scandals.         In Mr. Nixon's years as Representative, Senator, Vice President, candidate for governor of California, Presidential candidate and President, his wife was a fixture at his side, always seeming to listen raptly to his speeches and maintaining a gracious, if thin, smile.         In 1968, the writer Gloria Steinem interviewed Mrs. Nixon aboard an airplane while she was accompanying her husband on the Presidential campaign.  In the New York magazine article, Ms. Steinem quoted Mrs. Nixon as saying: "Now, I have friends in all the countries of the world. I haven't just sat back and thought of myself or my ideas or what I wanted to do. Oh no, I've stayed interested in people, I've kept working. Right here in the plane I keep this case with me, and the minute I sit down, I write my thank-you notes. Nobody gets by without a personal note. I don't have time to worry about who I admire or who I identify with. I've never had it easy. I'm not like all you . . . all those people who had it easy." Image as President's Wife         Although her years before the public exceeded those of her two predecessors at the White House, Mrs. Nixon did not seem to stamp her personality on the nation's consciousness. Instead, her image was of a private, dutiful wife seemingly self-contained and impenetrable.         Her composure rarely wavered in her appearances with her husband in such trying circumstances as his televised Checkers speech in 1952, when he denied unethical use of an $18,000 political fund ("Pat doesn't have a mink coat"), the ordeal in Caracas, Venezuela, in 1958, when a stone-throwing, spitting, anti-American mob besieged the Nixon limousine; and the Nixons' grim, hand-in-hand walk down a red carpet from the White House after his resignation on Aug. 9, 1974.         Despite the early traumas and Mrs. Nixon's wish that her husband retire from politics, she was enthusiastic enough on the eve of his nomination as the Republican Presidential candidate in 1968 to say, "This really is the American dream, where people from humble circumstances can, through sheer hard work, go up the ladder." Humble Origins in West         Her own origins had, indeed, been humble. She was born Thelma Catherine Ryan on March 16, 1912, in the small mining town of Ely, Nev. Her father, William, an itinerant miner of Irish-American ancestry, gave her the nickname Pat because of her birth on the eve of St. Patrick's Day.         Before she was a year old, her mother, Kate, a German-born woman with a son and daughter from a previous marriage, prevailed on her husband to leave the mines. The family moved to Artesia, Calif., about 20 miles southeast of Los Angeles, and started a truck farm on a four-acre plot that had little plumbing and no electricity.         "We all worked hard," Mrs. Nixon recalled years later. "We dug potatoes, we picked tomatoes, we picked peppers, cauliflowers and peanuts."         In 1924, when Pat was 12, her mother died of cancer.         "For the last two or three months I used to sit with her through the night," she said years later. "We couldn't afford a night nurse and she needed attention."         Five years after her mother's death, Pat's jolly, blue-eyed father, whom she adored, died of the miner's disease, silicosis. Cross-Country Trip         The five children in the family soon split up. Pat, at the age of 18, at the height of the Depression, set out for New York, driving an elderly couple across the country in their Packard.         For two years, until 1932, she worked in New York as a secretary and X-ray technician. The money she saved eventually got her back to California and into the University of Southern California, where her major was merchandising. Walk-on parts on Hollywood movie sets helped finance her education.         She graduated cum laude in 1937 and tried unsuccessfully to find work as a buyer for a department store. So she took a job at $190 a month teaching shorthand and typing at a secondary school in Whittier, Calif.         She was also interested in amateur theater, and at auditions for the play "The Dark Tower" one night in 1938, she met Richard M. Nixon, a recent graduate of Duke Law School who had set up practice in Whittier.         Both won parts in the play that night, and the young Nixon proposed to her a few hours later.         "I thought he was crazy," she said in 1969.         Mr. Nixon courted her for two years, sometimes even driving her to meet other beaus, before she accepted the proposal. Married in Riverside         They were married June 21, 1940, in a Quaker ceremony in Riverside, Calif. The bride was 28 years old, and Mr. Nixon was 10 months younger.         After finishing his naval service in 1945, Mr. Nixon decided to run for the House of Representatives. Just before the campaign started, the Nixons' older daughter, Patricia (Tricia), was born, on Feb. 21, 1946. In Representative Nixon's first term, another daughter, Julie, was born, on July 5, 1948.         Two years later, Mr. Nixon began a successful campaign for the Senate. While he generated controversy with his anti-Communist campaign speeches, his wife was portrayed in the press as projecting what would later be called a "20th-century born-in-a-log-cabin image."         She also began projecting the image of game and gracious campaigner, always able to suppress distress and bitterness.         As the President's wife, Mrs. Nixon traveled more than 100,000 miles, campaigning for her husband, accompanying him to foreign countries and, on several occasions, representing him at ceremonies abroad. Foreign Affairs Duties         She was the first wife of a President designated to head a United Nations delegation abroad, to the inauguration of President William R. Tolbert Jr. of Liberia in 1972. She also visited Peru in 1970 to see areas devastated by an earthquake, and in early 1974 she headed the United States delegation to inaugural ceremonies for the Presidents of Brazil and Venezuela.         Mrs. Nixon promoted various education programs and sought to enlist Americans in volunteer aid programs.         She shied away from adopting any publicity-inspiring projects like Jacqueline Kennedy's historical redecoration of the White House. Instead, she seemed to enjoy a more traditional and limited role in the White House, as Bess Truman and Mamie Eisenhower had.         Nixon White House receptions and dinners were frequent, but small and sedate, with none of the exuberance of the Kennedy and Johnson Presidencies. Only in receiving-line chitchat and in quiet little teas and receptions at the mansion did the real warmth and thoughtfulness of Mrs. Nixon's personality emerge. Seclusion at San Clemente         After her husband's resignation, Mrs. Nixon remained in seclusion for nine months with him at their estate in San Clemente, Calif., and moved to New York in 1980.         In the summer of 1976, Mrs. Nixon suffered a stroke that partly paralyzed her left arm and leg and the left side of her face for about a year. She had another stroke in the early 1980's and fully recovered from it, too. But in recent years she was very frail and suffered from emphysema, and she was hospitalized several times for lung problems, said Kathy O'Connor, Mr. Nixon's chief of staff.         Besides her husband and her daughters, Ms. Cox of Manhattan, whose husband, Edward F. Cox, is a lawyer, and Ms. Eisenhower of Berwyn, Pa., whose husband, David Eisenhower, is a military historian and grandson of President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Mrs. Nixon's survivors include two grandsons, Christopher Nixon Cox and Alex Richard Eisenhower, and two granddaughters, Melanie and Jennie Eisenhower.         A service for Mrs. Nixon with family members and friends attending will be held at 10 A.M. Saturday in the Richard Nixon Library and Birthplace in Yorba Linda, Calif., with the Rev. Dr. Billy Graham presiding and eulogies by Senator Bob Dole, Republican of Kansas, and others. A private burial service will follow on the grounds of the library.         Mrs. Nixon's body will lie in state at the library on Friday. The public will be admitted from 5 P.M. to 9 P.M.       
         Ethel Hausman, a founder and major supporter of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College in Manhasset, L. I., died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         She and her husband, Jack, joined Leonard and Isabel Goldenson and Jane Hoving in 1946 to found United Cerebral Palsy of New York City. All were parents of children with the disease, including the Hausmans' son Peter, who died last year. Their efforts also led to the formation of the national United Cerebral Palsy Associations, which merged similar groups around the country. Efforts Raised Millions         Mrs. Hausman founded the Women's Division of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and oversaw fund-raising campaigns that raised millions of dollars for the agency, which serves adults and children with cerebral palsy and related disabilities. She also was vice president of the International Cerebral Palsy Society in London and a board member of Rehabilitation International.         Mrs. Hausman devoted much of her life to helping others, especially chidren. With her husband, she was a principal donor to North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, where the Ethel and Jack Hausman Department of Pediatrics attests to their support.         North Shore University Hospital opened in Manhasset in 1953. But Mrs. Hausman was already engaged in fund raising in the late 1940's, when local residents pressed for the construction of a hospital in the area. She later served as co-chairwoman of the interior design committee.         Ethel and Jack Hausman endowed chairs bearing their names for a professor of pediatrics at North Shore University Hospital and for cerebral-palsy research at Harvard University.         Born in Manhattan, Ethel Hausman went to work in a restaurant at age 16. In 1927, she married Jack Hausman, whose family fortune derived from the textile business. He is vice chairman and former chairman of Belding Heminway Company, the Manhattan textile concern.         Mrs. Hausman served as a volunteer ambulance driver in World War II. She was an original tour guide at United Nations headquarters and a member of the U.N.'s Department of Public Information from 1949-64.         Besides her husband of nearly 65 years, Mrs. Hausman is survived by two sons, Richard and Michael, both of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Alexis Smith, a Hollywood actress of the 1940's and 50's who later won a Tony Award as a star of the Broadway musical "Follies," died yesterday at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 72 and lived in Los Angeles.         The cause was cancer, her doctors said.         In a career that began when she was spotted by a Warner Brothers talent agent in 1941, Miss Smith had an image as a strong-willed actress who often played tempestuous romantic leads opposite many of Hollywood's most glamourous male stars.         Starting out as a young actress at Warner Brothers, she played a series of film roles that established her as one of Hollywood's leading actresses. Though known for her beauty, with her penetrating blue-green eyes and low, throaty voice, she managed to submerge it when asked to play a vengeful woman or a cold, calculating seductress. Popular With Crews         One of her most successful films was "Night and Day" (1946), in which she played the wife of the composer Cole Porter, opposite Cary Grant.         Among her other films were "The Constant Nymph" (1943), with Charles Boyer; "The Horn Blows at Midnight" (1945), with Jack Benny; "Stallion Road" (1947), with Ronald Reagan; "Of Human Bondage" (the 1946 version), with Paul Henreid and Eleanor Parker; "The Two Mrs. Carrolls" (1947), with Humphrey Bogart; "Any Number Can Play" (1949), with Clark Gable; "Here Comes the Groom" (1951), with Bing Crosby; and "The Turning Point" (1952), with William Holden.         More often than not, Miss Smith received good reviews even when her play or film had bad ones. And on stage and film sets, she was widely known as an easygoing professional who loved her craft. Like Barbara Stanwyck, whose career paralleled hers, she was a favorite among crews and stagehands. From Canada to Broadway         Miss Smith was born in Canada, but her family moved to Los Angeles when she was a child and she grew up in Southern California. While a student at Los Angeles City College, she was spotted by a Warner Brothers talent scout when she appeared in a campus theater production. The steady stream of films that followed extended her career for nearly two decades.         But in what many critics regard as the pinnacle of her career, Miss Smith became the toast of Broadway in 1971 when she starred in the Stephen Sondheim musical "Follies" and wowed patrons with her biting rendition of "Could I Leave You?"         Starting in 1984, she had a small, recurring role in the hit CBS television series "Dallas." In 1988 she appeared in the short-lived television drama "Hothouse."         But her opinion of her film career was mixed. In a 1971 interview, she said she rarely watched her old films because she thought they were not very good and "would not improve with age."         "People frequently said it was a shame Warner Brothers typecast me," she said. "But I believe I typecast myself." She cited actresses like Bette Davis and Olivia de Havilland, who successfully resisted such efforts.         "I ended up being the wife of Cole Porter sitting in the audience applauding the composer," she added ruefully.         Miss Smith was married for 49 years to Craig Stevens, the actor who played the title role in the television series "Peter Gunn" in the late 1950's and early 60's. Miss Smith and Mr. Stevens often played opposite each other in film, television and stage shows. They had no children.         She is survived by Mr. Stevens.       
         Ruth Krauss, the author of "The Carrot Seed," "A Hole Is to Dig: A First Book of First Definitions" and other books for children, died on Saturday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 91.         Ms. Krauss was born in Baltimore, where she attended the Peabody Institute of Music. She received a bachelor's degree from the Parsons School of Fine and Applied Art in New York City.         Her first book, "A Good Man and His Good Wife," with illustrations by the abstract painter Ad Reinhardt, was published in 1944. Over the next four decades, she wrote 34 more books for children, many of them illustrated by her husband, David Johnson Leisk, who wrote children's books under the pen name Crockett Johnson. He died in 1975. Eight of Ms. Krauss's books were illustrated by Maurice Sendak, beginning in 1952 with "A Hole Is to Dig."         At a time when children's books tended to be didactic, with lots of text, Ms. Krauss pioneered the use of minimal text, concentrating on precise language and working closely with an illustrator.         In addition to children's books, Ms. Krauss wrote verse plays and poetry for adults.         She was awarded the Caldecott Medal for "The Happy Day" (1950) and "A Very Special House" (1954).       
         Margaret Van Doren Bevans, author, editor and illustrator of children's books, died on Wednesday at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, Conn. She was 75 and lived in West Cornwall, Conn.         Her sister, Barbara Klaw, said the cause was lung cancer.         Mrs. Bevans's most widely distributed work is her illustrations for the original "Pat the Bunny," (Golden Books, 1940), created by Dorothy Kunhardt, the second-best-selling children's book ever, after "Peter Rabbit."         She is author and illustrator of "Thomas Retires," (Viking, 1939) a children's book. Other works include " 'I Wonder Why,' Thought the Owl," (Putnam, 1965) and "Danny Kaye's Around the World Story Book," (Random House, 1960), of which she was co-editor.         She was editor of a best-selling book for adults, "Vogue's Book of Etiquette," (Simon & Schuster, 1948), compiled by the late Millicent H. Fenwick. She also edited "McCall's Book of Everyday Etiquette" (Golden Press, 1960).         Born in New York City, she was the daughter of the historian and critic Carl Van Doren and of Irita Van Doren, for many years literary editor of The New York Herald Tribune. She studied art at Cooper Union in Manhattan.         In 1975 Mrs. Bevans and her family moved to West Cornwall, where she served on the Cornwall Board of Education from 1977 to 1983. She was also Cornwall's representative on the board of Housatonic Valley Regional High School.         She and her husband, Tom Torre Bevans, founded The Cornwall Chronicle in 1991.

Besides her husband and sister of West Cornwall, surviving are two daughters, Anne Bevans of West Cornwall and Jane Duber of Lillooet, British Columbia; a son, John, of West Cornwall, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  July 25, 1993, Sunday         An obituary last Sunday about Margaret Van Doren Bevans, author and illustrator of children's books, included a work among her credits erroneously. "Pat the Bunny" (Golden Books, 1940) was illustrated by its author, Dorothy Kunhardt.       
         Dr. Barbara Whitney, an expert in sex education and a leader in the battle against AIDS in New York City's public schools, died on Friday at a friend's home on Squam Lake, N.H. She was 56 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         For the last two years, Dr. Whitney worked in the School Chancellor's office as director of the H.I.V./AIDS Technical Assistance Project, a privately financed program that teaches AIDS prevention throughout the school system. 20 Years in the Field         Dr. Whitney spent the last 20 years as a trainer, educator and administrator in the field of human sexuality. From 1978 to 1985 she was executive director of Siecus, the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States, in New York City.

Dr. Whitney, a native of Iowa, graduated summa cum laude from the College of Nursing at the State University of Iowa and earned a master's degree at Boston University's School of Nursing. While pursing her career, she studied psychoeducation at Temple University and not-for-profit management at Columbia University's School of Business. She received a Ph.D. in 1988 from the human-sexuality program in the Department of Health Education at New York University, which entailed studies in Sweden, Japan and Kenya.

         Florence Cooper, a Manhattan community organizer of child-care and women's-support services, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Washington Heights.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cooper, who remained active until her death, was the membership chairwoman of the Upper West Manhattan branch of the League of Women Voters. She served on the boards of Fort George Head Start and the Napeague Institute of Art in Amagansett, L.I.

         Helen Kaplan, who devoted her life to helping retarded children and making the public aware of their needs, died on Wednesday at Central General Hospital in Plainview, L.I. A resident of Old Westbury, she was 82.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Kaplan was a founder and charter member of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, Nassau County Chapter. She served as its secretary, vice president and president, and finally, from 1961 until 1988, as its executive director. After that, she continued to attend functions and maintained an active interest in the organization until her death.         In the late 1940's retarded children had few opportunities in education, training or recreation. This led to the birth of the association in New York City in 1949. News quickly spread to Long Island and the Nassau chapter sprang up the same year. Son Died of Leukemia         Mrs. Kaplan's first child, David, was retarded, and died of leukemia at the age of 9 in 1952, two years after she opened the fledgling association's first day camp for 24 children. In 1950 she started a demonstration training program, which she ran for eight years.         She became the guiding force behind the growth of the Nassau Association for the Help of Retarded Children, whose more than 8,000 members support educational, vocational, residential and other programs to serve 1,400 children and adults and their families. She spent 11 years as a full-time volunteer until the death of her husband, Allan, in 1960, when she joined the salaried staff.         The New York association now has chapters in nearly every county and sister organizations across the country. The statewide group, Nysarc Inc., belongs to the Arc of the United States.         Mrs. Kaplan grew up in Philadelphia. She graduated from the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music and was an accomplished pianist.         She sat on several influential committees and received many honors. Among them was the first Helen Award, created by a State Commissioner of Mental Health, Alan Miller, and named after her.         Mrs. Kaplan is survived by another son, Michael, of Manhattan, and a grandson.       
         Florence Baker Martineau, long active in the New York Heart Association and other charitable organizations, died yesterday in Waterbury Hospital in Connecticut. She was 81 and lived in Palm Beach, Fla.         Mrs. Martineau had been visiting a friend in Washington, Conn., when she entered the hospital. The cause of her death was complications from bronchial pneumonia, her family said.         Mrs. Martineau was a supporter of the Muscular Dystrophy Research Fund at Children's Hospital in Boston.         Born in Manhattan, she was a daughter of George F. Baker Jr., a banker, and the former Edith Brevoort Kane. She was a granddaughter of George F. Baker, a director of 43 banks and corporations. Mrs. Martineau graduated from what is now called the Hewitt School and Sarah Lawrence College.  She lived in Washington, Conn., before moving to Palm Beach nine years ago.         Her marriage in 1932 to Thomas Suffern Tailer, a sportsman, ended in divorce. In 1941 she married Stanley Martineau, a sculptor whose works included a bust of Franklin D. Roosevelt.  Mr. Martineau died in 1977.         Mrs. Martineau is survived by 2 daughters from her first marriage, Fern de Narvaez of Palm Beach and Wendy Holt of Cool, Calif.; a son from her second marriage, Michael, of Granville, Mass.; 9 grandchildren, and 11 great-grandchildren.       
         Mary Bickford Paulsen, the mother of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, died in her sleep yesterday at the Governor's Residence in Hartford, his office announced.

She was 85 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She and her husband, Samuel, founded the business in 1948. They were then joined by their children, Roberta and Peter. When their parents retired, the children took over the business on Madison Avenue.

         Elise Reiman, a longtime teacher at the School of American Ballet, died on Thursday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was 79.         The cause was an aneurysm, said Norman E. Kappler, her nephew. Miss Reiman, who lived in New York, was taken to the hospital after she became ill on vacation in Winthrop, Me.         Miss Reiman, who was born in Terre Haute, Ind., studied with Adolph Bolm in San Francisco and danced in his 1928 production of "Apollon Musagete." She also studied at the School of American Ballet in its earliest years and danced with the American Ballet in 1935 and 1936 and with Ballet Society from 1946 to 1948. Both companies were forerunners of the New York City Ballet; like it, they were formed by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein.         Miss Reiman taught children's and beginning point classes from 1945 to 1953 and from 1964 through this summer. A keen-eyed teacher with a wry, deceptively lazy humor, she received the school's Mae L. Wien Award for distinguished service, in 1992.         Miss Reiman performed in the original productions of Balanchine's "Four Temperaments" and "Divertimento."         She was married to Charles W.

         Doris G. Ross, a volunteer worker for children's welfare for half a century and former national president of the Girls Clubs of America, died on Friday at White Plains Hospital. She was 74.         A family member said the cause was heart disease.         She was a former actress and member of Max Reinhardt's drama school. She also studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute.         Her interest in the arts and concern for children came together in the 1970's, when she helped establish the Children's Creative Theater of the Girls Clubs of America and the Theater Arts Players of Temple Emanu-El. She was the first president of the Theater Arts Players. She became president of the Girls Clubs in 1957, after serving as vice president.         She is survived by two daughters, Phyllis Ross Schless of New York and Allyne Ross of Scarsdale; three sisters, Shirlee Land of Purchase, N.Y., Rhodina Schwartz and Paula Bogdan, both of Cincinnati, and a brother, Herbert Stark of Amherst, Mass.       
         Irma Lazarus, a patron and an advocate of the arts, died on Aug. 26 at her home in Cincinnati. She was 80.         The cause was amyloidosis, a cancer-causing blood disorder, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Lazarus founded the Ohio Arts Council in 1965 and was its chairwoman from 1973 to 1975. She also served on the boards of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, the Cincinnati Ballet, the Cincinnati Opera and the American Symphony Orchestra League.         The opening concerts of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra seasons will be dedicated to her memory.         For 35 years she appeared on television in an informal interview program called "Conversations With Irma," which was carried on Channel 48 in Cincinnati, one of the country's first public television stations.         Her friends included leaders of the performing arts, particularly in the music world. She also was active as a fund raiser for AIDS-relief volunteers of Cincinnati.         She was awarded the 1993 Ohio Arts Council's Governor's award for a half-century of leadership in the arts.         Mrs. Lazarus, whose maiden name was Mendelsohn, was born in Brooklyn. She was graduated from Smith College in 1934.         She is survived by her husband, Fred Lazarus 3d, and their three children: Fred 4th, of Baltimore; Eleanor, of Watertown, Mass., and Margaret Crawford of Rhinebeck, N.Y.; a sister, Eleanor Strauss of Cincinnati; and two children by her previous marriage, to George Rau: Elizabeth Bloch of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and George Rau Jr. of Crested Butte, Colo.       
         Dr. Barbara Biber Bodansky, a leading researcher in child psychology and early education for nearly half a century, died on Tuesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 89.         Her family said she had had a long illness.         Dr. Biber -- the name she used professionally -- was chairman of the child development faculty of the Bank Street College of Education from 1931 to 1960. She directed its research division from 1950 to 1963.         In those positions, she played a central role in creating several new graduate and research programs dealing with early education theory, child psychology and social policy.         In 1973 she became a Distinguished Research Scholar Emeritus at the college, which is on 112th Street near Broadway and was founded in 1916 as a center for training and research in early childhood education. Strong Self-Images         As a teacher, Dr. Biber believed that the best early education programs develop the emotional life of children as well as their intellects, foster strong self-images, encourage responsibility to others, and support imagination and curiosity.         Toward that end, Dr. Biber, along with her colleagues at the college, helped to establish teacher workshops in New York City public schools in the 1940's and 50's.         In the 1960's she directed a study of schools and mental health with a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health. At the end of that decade, she began devising the basic principles for federally financed day care and Head Start programs.         At the age of 80, she completed "Early Education and Psychological Development" (Yale University Press, 1984). She also was co-author of two books reporting major research studies: "Child Life in School" (1942) and "The Pyschological Impact of School Experience" (1969).         Dr. Biber, who was born in Brooklyn, first attended Barnard College and then graduated from the University of Chicago. She received a Ph.D. in psychology in 1942 from Columbia University.         In 1929, Dr. Biber was married to Dr. Oscar Bodansky, chief of clinical biochemistry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He died in 1977.         She is survived by a daughter, Margery B. Franklin of Manhattan; two grandsons, Kenneth and David Frankin, and a sister, Lilian Uviller Pilat.       
         Barbara Taylor Schoen, an author and the founder and director of the writing program at the State University of New York at Purchase, died on Thursday at her Purchase home. She was 69.         She had been ill for a long time, her family said.         Mrs. Schoen, a native of Manhattan, graduated from Bryn Mawr College, cum laude, and Boston University, where she earned a master's degree in physics. While pursuing a doctorate in physics at Boston, she worked on isotope analysis as a technician in the Department of Biophysics of Harvard Medical School.         While raising four children, she began a writing career in the 1950's and saw her short stories first published in Seventeen magazine. Over the years, she also contributed articles on education, personal computers and other subjects to various periodicals.         She was the author of two well-received novels for young readers, "A Place and A Time" (1967) and "A Spark of Joy" (1969), both published by Crowell.         Mrs. Schoen (rhymes with phone) became a teacher-counselor in 1970 at the Cooperative College in Mount Vernon, which was later merged into the College of Letters and Sciences at SUNY-Purchase. At Purchase she became an assistant professor of language arts in 1973 and an associate professor five years later.         A tenured faculty member, she was teaching nine undergraduate courses covering various aspects of writing from poetry to essays to fiction and science. She had been director of the college's Writing Program since 1984. As such she developed a series of courses and a set of creative-writing classes for literature majors hoping to write professionally.         Mrs. Schoen is survived by her husband of 47 years, Donald R.; two sons, Robert of Southport, Conn., and John of Riverside, Conn.; two daughters, Claire Werner of Norwalk, Conn., and Susan Terray of Woods Hole, Mass.; her mother, Caroline Colgate Taylor of Manhattan; a sister, Alice Day of Canberra, Australia; a brother, Howard C. Taylor 3d of Jericho, Vt., and six grandchildren.       
         Zita Johann, a stage and film actress who played Boris Karloff's love interest in "The Mummy," died on Friday at Nyack Hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 89 and lived in Orangeburg, N.Y.         The cause was pneumonia, said a friend, Rosemary Franck.         Miss Johann was born near Temesvar, Hungary, now Timisoara, Romania. She moved to New York City with her family when she was 7 and appeared in high school productions. After applying to the Theater Guild for work as an understudy, she immediately won roles in touring productions of "Peer Gynt," "The Devil's Disciple" and "He Who Gets Slapped."         She made her Broadway debut in 1924 in the Theater Guild's production of "Man and the Masses." Other leading roles followed, in "Machinal" (1928), "Tomorrow and Tomorrow" (1931) and other plays. To Hollywood and Back         In 1931 she played the wife of a steelworker who succumbs to drink in "The Struggle," the last film by D. W. Griffith. Most memorably, she played Helen Grosvenor in "The Mummy" (1932), whom the Mummy takes to be the vestal priestess for whom he conceived a forbidden passion 3,700 years earlier.         After appearing in "Tiger Shark" (1932), "Luxury Liner" (1933) and "Grand Canary" (1934), she returned to New York to act in the theater. She appeared in "Panic" (1935), "Flight Into China" (1939), "The Burning Deck" (1940) and "The Broken Journey" (1942).         During World War II, she raised money for war-related charities and organized shows for American soldiers on their way overseas. In recent decades, she worked with disturbed children and gave private acting lessons.         Her three marriages, to John Houseman, the director, John McCormick, an agent, and Bernard E. Shedd, an economist and publisher, all ended in divorce. She had no children.       
         Tamara Dembo, a psychologist who developed a method to study anger in social situations, died on Sunday at Memorial Hospital in Worcester, Mass. She was 91 and lived in Worcester.         Professor Dembo, who had taught at Clark University in Worcester, did important early work in Gestalt psychology in the United States, particularly in rehabilitation psychology. She developed a method to provoke anger in the subjects of experiments and developed a theory, in keeping with the Gestalt school, that the onset of anger depends more on situations than personality.         She was head of Clark University's Rehabilitation Psychology Training Program from 1962 to 1972 and was one of two recipients of the first research awards from the Division of Rehabilitation Counseling of the American Personnel and Guidance Association. Her research, which focused on problems in returning to a normal life after the loss of limbs or disfigurement, was applied after World War II to help injured veterans. At Clark, she also directed research with children suffering from cerebral palsy. Native of Russia         Professor Dembo was born in Baku, Russia, and grew up in St. Petersburg. She earned her doctorate from the University of Berlin in 1930 and emigrated to the United States before World War II to do research at Smith College, which she continued at Cornell University, the University of Iowa, Mount Holyoke College and Stanford University.         In 1948, she became an associate professor at the New School for Social Research in New York and then a research fellow at Harvard University in 1951. She joined the faculty at Clark University in 1953.         Professor Dembo, who lived on the Clark University campus, retired from active teaching in 1972 and was made a professor emeritus.       
         Liza Anne Bosworth, a partner in a Manhattan law firm, died on Oct. 18 in San Francisco, where she was on a business trip. She was 35 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was accidental drowning, her family said.         A native of Manhattan, Ms. Bosworth graduated from Amherst College and, in 1983, from Columbia University Law School. She was admitted to the bar the following year, and joined the firm of Reboul, MacMurray, Hewitt, Maynard & Kristol in 1988 as an associate. She became a partner last year. She specialized in litigation in the firm's international practice.         Ms. Bosworth is survived by her husband, Nicholas Pearson, a sculptor; two children, Lukas and Julia; her parents, Stanley Bosworth, headmaster of Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights, and Anne Bosworth, head librarian of the school, which they jointly founded in 1965; a sister, Virginia Frisch of San Francisco, and a brother, Adam Bosworth of Seattle.       
         Genevieve Sanchez Klein, a former member of the New York State Board of Regents and an outspoken critic of sex education and busing to integrate schools, died on Monday at her home in Daytona, Fla. She was 79.         The cause was cancer of the brain and lungs, said Howard Hurwitz, a friend.         Ms. Klein was appointed to the regents board by the New York State Assembly in 1974, after working for nearly 30 years as a physical education instructor and administrator in New York City public schools.         She was chairwoman of the physical education department at Jamaica High School in Queens from the early 1960's until 1973, when she retired from the school system. Before that, she had taught at Bayside High School in Queens. Denied Re-Election         She was working an assistant professor of health at Lehman College of the City University of New York when she was appointed as the second woman ever to serve on the Board of Regents, which supervises all education in the state.         During her three-year term, she frequently voted in the minority to oppose measures on forced busing of children to further integration of schools. She also voted against a set of guidelines to help school districts select textbooks that dealt with sex or included profanity, saying the rules did not protect the right of parents to object to such material.         She sought re-election to a full seven-year term on the board in 1977, but she was defeated by a vote of 108 to 99 by the Assembly, then controlled by Democrats.         After leaving the board, she was active in the anti-abortion movement and lectured on policy for public schools. She was also active in the Family Defense Council, a group based in Queens that campaigned against curriculum changes advocated by former Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez. She moved to Daytona in 1990.         Ms. Klein graduated from New York University in 1936 and received a master's degree in education from Colorado State College of Education in 1937.         She is survived by two sons, John F., of Orange Park, Fla., and James V., of Bellmont, Calif; a sister, Muriel Zeigler, of Malverne, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Jane G. Judge, who spent five decades as a social worker, educator and child advocate, died on Wednesday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         For many years Mrs. Judge was associated with Sarah Lawrence College, where she was professor emeritus of childhood development, and the Community Service Society of New York. A vivacious woman who cared passionately about her causes, she came to the Community Service Society in 1932 and worked there into the 1950's, finally as a consultant on its child-care program.         From the 1930's until 1947, she ran the society's district office in Harlem. Appalled that the office was staffed entirely by white social workers trying to serve a mostly black community, she convinced the board of the need to bring in trained black workers.         She first came to Sarah Lawrence in 1937, teaching part time at the invitation of Constance Warren, then college president. She retired as a professor in 1971 but remained a consultant and director of its early-childhood center for five more years. Over the years, she also taught at Columbia and New York Universities.         Born Jane Griswold in Madison, Wis., she was a 1924 graduate of Smith College and held a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work, now part of Columbia University.         She collaborated with Dr. Benjamin Spock to develop treatment centers for children in Westchester, which did not exist in the 1940's, and to organize the Mental Health Association of Westchester. When the Federal Government set up the Headstart program for pre-schoolers, she served as a consultant.         Her husband, John S. Judge, died in 1973. Mrs. Judge is survived by a daughter, Jennifer Judge Howes of Great Neck, L.I.; a son, Jeremy of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.       
         Cecilia Brinton Bogner, a retired Boston psychologist, died on Oct. 31 at Sherrill House, a Boston nursing home. She was 93 and lived in Lincoln, Mass.         She had suffered a brief illness, according to the Bell-O'Dea Funeral Home in Brookline.         A native of Lowell, Mass., Mrs. Bogner graduated from Radcliffe College. She was associated most prominently with the Neurological Clinic of Children's Hospital as well as Ecole Bilingue in Arlington, Mass., and the Putney School in Vermont. She served on the board of Rutland Corner House, an early halfway house for women, in Brookline.         Mrs. Bogner, who outlived three husbands, Profs. Penfield Roberts, Crane Brinton and Walter Bogner, is survived by a daughter, Jane Roberts Gill of Brookline; a sister, Catherine Allphin of Middletown, R.I.; six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Anne Spencer Lindbergh, a writer and the elder daughter of the aviation pioneer Charles A. Lindbergh and Anne Morrow Lindbergh, died Friday at her home in Thetford Center, Vt. She was 53.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Noel Perrin.         Ms. Lindbergh was one of six children of her famous parents; she was born eight years after the kidnapping and killing of Charles A. Lindbergh Jr.         She grew up in Darien, Conn., and, after studying at Radcliffe College for three years, moved to Paris to continue her education. While there she met and married a fellow student at the Sorbonne, Julien Feydy, who became a political scientist and university professor. They later divorced.         She later married Jerzy Sapieyevski, a composer and conductor she met in Europe and with whom she moved to Washington. They also divorced.         In her career as a writer, Ms. Lindbergh wrote 14 books, most of them for children. Her two most recent works are "Three Lives to Live" and "Travel Far, Pay No Fare." She was the recipient of several honors for her work, including an award from the International Reading Association.         Two of her more popular books are "The People in Pineapple Place" and "The Prisoner of Pineapple Place," both written in Washington, where she was then living. Many of the scenic backgrounds were taken from areas in Georgetown close to her home. She also taught school in Washington.         She moved to Vermont in 1987, and the next year she married Mr. Perrin, a writer and professor of environmental studies at Dartmouth College. Ms. Lindbergh also taught for several years at the Riverside School in Lyndonville, Vt.         Ms. Lindbergh's mother, who is a poet and essayist, lives in Darien and Barnet, Vt. Her father died in 1974 at his home in Hawaii.         Ms. Lindbergh is also survived by a daughter, Constance Feydy, and a son, Marek Sapieyevski, both of Thetford Center; two step-daughters, Elisabeth Perrin, of Seattle and Amy Perrin, of White River Junction, Vt.; a sister, Reeve Tripp, of Barnet, and three brothers, Jon, of North Bend, Wash., Land, of Missoula, Mont., and Scott, of Brasilia.

         Myrna Loy, the urbane actress who personified a liberated wife of intelligence and wry good humor in some of the best American movie comedies of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 88.         She died in surgery after a long illness, said Sherlee Lantz, a longtime friend of Miss Loy.         With a pert face, crinkly smile and velvet voice, the auburn-haired actress was universally called the "perfect wife." Spunky, unflappable and appropriately cool or warm, she was the ideal marital partner of the dapper William Powell in the 1934 hit comedy-mystery "The Thin Man." They followed "The Thin Man" with five popular sequels and seven other films.         Performing with zest and bantering affection, they were the nifty Nick and Nora Charles created by Dashiell Hammett in his novel "The Thin Man." Their breezy films, peppered with outlandish clues and outrageous characters, were among the most enduring of Hollywood's larger-than-life big-studio comedies that won millions of new fans over the decades. Turned Into Ideal Mother         Eventually, the ideal wife became the ideal mother in such successes as "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946) and "Cheaper by the Dozen" (1950). Miss Loy then settled into character roles in occasional films and stage and television plays. In 1973 she made her Broadway debut in a revival of Clare Boothe Luce's vitriolic comedy "The Women," again as a shrewd mother.         In 1981, Miss Loy and Henry Fonda were a graying couple perceptively reminiscing about their half-century marriage in a television movie, "Summer Solstice." Their performances prompted John J. O'Connor of The New York Times to write that "Mr. Fonda and Miss Loy demonstrate splendidly why they remain stars."         Of Welsh descent, the actress was born Myrna Williams on Aug. 2, 1905, on her father's cattle ranch near Helena, Mont. Her father, David Williams, called her Myrna, after the name of a railroad water stop that caught his fancy. Her mother, Della, was a singer. Started in a Chorus Line         From her father, a state legislator who was an advocate of President Woodrow Wilson's crusade to establish the League of Nations, she gained a sense of public service that lasted a lifetime.         The actress interrupted her career for Red Cross volunteer work throughout World War II. Soon after, she joined the United States delegation to the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, serving as a peripatetic film adviser for five years.         Her father died in the influenza epidemic of 1918, and Mrs. Williams moved her daughter and son, David, to Los Angeles, where Myrna attended Venice High School and occasionally taught dancing. At the age of 18, she joined the chorus line in the stage show at Grauman's Chinese Theater.         She began getting bit parts in movies. A poet friend suggested the catchy name Loy, and it stuck. The teen-ager was quickly typecast as an exotic temptress, invariably Oriental and often villainous. Slinking and gyrating, she was trapped for nearly a decade in the stereotype in such films as "The Desert Song," "The Squall" and "The Black Watch," all released in 1929. 'The Thin Man,' a 'Quickie'         The most bizarre of these 60 or so oddities were two 1932 melodramas -- "The Mask of Fu Manchu," in which Miss Loy reluctantly portrayed the sadistic daughter of the archvillain Boris Karloff, and "Thirteen Women" in which, as a skulking Javanese half-caste, she plotted to do in 12 sorority sisters.         Occasionally, Miss Loy escaped the cliche. She gained notice for her acting as a predatory countess in the 1932 musical fantasy "Love Me Tonight," which starred Maurice Chevalier; as the materialistic wife of Leslie Howard in "The Animal Kingdom" in 1932, and as the love interest in a 1934 gangster thriller, "Manhattan Melodrama," starring Clark Gable and Mr. Powell.         A few months later, Myrna Loy became a household name and a full- fledged star. W. S. Van Dyke, one of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's most versatile directors, persuaded studio executives to let him feature Miss Loy with Mr. Powell in a low-budget "B" movie, to be called "The Thin Man." The director shot the film in 21 days, and the "quickie" was a hit. In Well-Known Comedies         Later, when she was billed as "Queen of the Movies" and Gable was called the "King," the two were teamed in such madcap adventures as "Wife Versus Secretary," "Test Pilot" and "Too Hot to Handle."         At the start of World War II, Miss Loy left Hollywood and did full-time volunteer work, serving for four years as an assistant head of Red Cross welfare activities in New York. She also arranged for entertainment in 50 military hospitals and put in long stints at stage-door canteens.         After the war, she portrayed the compassionate, loving wife of Fredric March in "The Best Years of Our Lives," the much-honored 1946 film about servicemen returning from combat. The performance won her the Brussels World Film Festival prize for the best performance by an actress.         A political liberal, Miss Loy joined with other Hollywood figures in the late 40's in challenging what they deplored as the witch-hunting proceedings of the House Committee on Un-American Activities.         Of her postwar film work for Unesco, the actress said, "One little incident to battle prejudice, dropped into the middle of an entertaining film, is worth all the documentaries ever made."         Miss Loy was a longtime friend of Eleanor Roosevelt and other leading Democrats and regularly campaigned for the party's Presidential candidates. She was also an adviser and former officer of the National Committee Against Discrimination in Housing. Started on Stage in 1960         She did not appear on the stage until 1960, at first in summer stock, because, she said, "I felt I had a lot to learn." She starred with Claude Dauphin in the comedy "The Marriage Go-Round" and played the mother in a national tour of Neil Simon's "Barefoot in the Park."         In 1980, the National Board of Review of Motion Pictures presented her with its first David Wark Griffith award "in grateful recognition of her outstanding contribution to the art of screen acting."         Miss Loy was married four times, to Arthur Hornblow Jr., a movie producer; John D. Hertz Jr., an auto-rental and advertising executive; Gene Markey, a producer-screenwriter, and Howland H. Sargeant, a producer and, at the time, Assistant Secretary of State for Public Affairs. The marriages ended in divorce. Miss Loy had no children.         In later decades, Miss Loy lived in a book-lined terrace apartment in upper Manhattan overlooking the East River. She aided many civic causes, selecting her public-service committees as judiciously as her roles. Tribute at Carnegie Hall         In 1985, Hollywood movie stars and fans packed Carnegie Hall for a tribute to Miss Loy, who appeared in the audience looking frail but glamorous in a spangled gown. Lauren Bacall, the master of ceremonies, said she admired Miss Loy "as a person, an actress and a face, but also as a woman aware of what went on in the country and the world."         "She's not a frivolous human being," Miss Bacall added. "And she's a great wit, which I'm a sucker for."         Miss Loy won her only Oscar, an honorary one, in 1991, more than six decades after she began her film career. Speaking via satellite hookup from her Manhattan apartment the night of the Academy Awards ceremony, she offered the audience only nine words to describe her feelings. "You've made me very happy," she said. "Thank you very much." Some of the Best Years of Her Life         Myrna Loy brought a sly wit and an easy charm to many films, including the following.         The Jazz Singer 1927         The Mask of Fu Manchu 1932         Penthouse 1933         The Thin Man 1934         Manhattan Melodrama 1934         The Great Ziegfeld 1936         After the Thin Man 1936         Test Pilot 1938         Too Hot to Handle 1938         The Best Years of Our Lives 1946         Mr. Blandings Builds His Dream House 1948         Cheaper by the Dozen 1950         From the Terrace 1960         Midnight Lace 1960         The End 1978         Just Tell Me What You Want 1980

         Janet Margolin, an actress with a string of roles in the 1960's and 70's including parts in two Woody ALlen movies, died yesterday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 50.

But she was better know for her film and television parts, particularly as an emotionally disturbed teen-ager in the movie "David and Lisa" (1962) and as Woody ALlen's girlfriend, Louise, in "Take the Money and Run" (1969).         She also played one of Mr. Allen's former wives in "Anni Hall" (1977).         Born in New York City, Ms. Margolin graduated from the High School of Performing Arts in 1961.

         Dr. Marie H. Briehl, one of the country's earliest child psychoanalysts, died on Saturday at her home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 96.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         Dr. Briehl was director emeritus of the child analysis section at the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute in Los Angeles.         Born in Czarist Russia, she came to this country as a toddler. She graduated from Hunter College and taught at Hunter College High School.

She trained with Anna Freud, daughter of Sigmund Freud and herself a founder of child analysis.         Returning to New York in 1930, Dr. Briehl resumed her teaching career and also started psychological and psychoanalytic treatment of children privately and at Mount Sinai Hospital. She became a full-time analyst in 1940.         Six years later, she and her husband moved to Los Angeles, where she established the training program for child analysis in the Southern California Psychoanalytic Society and Institute and worked as training and supervising analyst.
