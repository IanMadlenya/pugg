         Adele Marcus, teacher to two generations of outstanding pianists, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         A representative list of Ms. Marcus's prominent students might include Horacio Gutierrez, Byron Janis, Stephen Hough, Cy Coleman, Panayis Lyras, Jon Kimura Parker, Neil Sedaka, Edward Aldwell, Jeffrey Swann, Santiago Rodriguez, Ken Noda, Peter Orth, Norman Krieger, Jeffrey Biegel and Augustin Anievas.         Ms. Marcus taught with a combination of wit and passion, and mainly at the Juilliard School. She joined the faculty there in 1954 and stayed until 1990. Her peripatetic master classes around the world ended in 1984, but she continued to teach at home until several years ago.         Adele Marcus was born in 1906 in Kansas City, Mo., the 13th and last child of a rabbi of Russian origins. Her father was 73 at her birth. When the family moved to Los Angeles, Ms. Marcus and her sister Rosamund formed a piano duo. They were known locally as the Two Prodigies. In Los Angeles her teachers were Desider Josef Vecsei and Alexis Kall, but at 15, Ms. Marcus auditioned for Josef Lhevinne. A year later, she became his pupil and subsequently his assistant, a job she held for seven years. She also studied with Artur Schnabel in Europe.         In 1928 Ms. Marcus won the Walter H. Naumburg Foundation Award and made her debut at Town Hall. She subseqently played with most of the major American orchestras and gave recitals in Town Hall, Carnegie Hall, Avery Fisher Hall and Alice Tully Hall.         Although students who heard her play in the studio have remarked on her tone, technique and almost religiously Romantic approach to the piano, Ms. Marcus made teaching the center of her career. She was known for her master classes, especially at the Aspen Festival in Colorado, and in 1980 she established her own summer piano festival in northern Norway. She was the author of "Great Pianists Speak with Adele Marcus."         Serious as her approach may have been, she had a wry outlook on the professional world of music. Once asked about the value of debuts for her students, she answered: "It's one thing to launch a ship. It's another to make it sail." Joseph Polisi, president of the Juilliard School, said yesterday, "Ms. Marcus dedicated her career here at Juilliard to her students and her life to her art."         No immediate family members survive.         There is to be a memorial service on Sunday at 1:30 at the Plaza Memorial Chapel, 630 Amsterdam Avenue, at 91st Street, Manhattan.       
         Jean Muir, the British fashion classicist whose design career spanned more than 30 years, died on Sunday in London at the London Clinic. She was 66.         She died of breast cancer, according to a report in The Daily Telegraph.         Often referred to as the doyenne of British fashion, Miss Muir, as she insisted everyone call her, designed starkly simple clothes that were timeless and elegant. A perfectionist who tried on everything she designed, she was best known for matte jersey dresses, supple suedes, featherlight punched leathers and cashmere sweaters.         She considered herself a dressmaker first and foremost, yet employed tailoring techniques to achieve the controlled flow of fabric that gave her jersey dresses their signature fit. The shoulders were small, the waist slightly raised and the skirt fluid. It was a shape that particularly suited her petite figure. The dresses were nearly always in the somber black and navy blue she preferred and wore almost exclusively.         Miss Muir developed a personal style that changed very little. For most of her life, her reddish brown hair was cut into a straight bob, her face was chalky white and her lipstick the color of black currants. Her London apartment was entirely white, down to the white rubber flooring. She was frequently quoted as saying, "When you find something that suits you and never lets you down, why not stick with it?" It was a statement that applied equally well to herself and to the clothes she designed, which were instantly identifiable as Jean Muirs and never followed the vagaries of fashion.         "Jean was unique and original and irreplaceable," said Geraldine Stutz, the former president and owner of Henri Bendel in New York, which carried Miss Muir's clothing from the early 60's until the late 80's. The clothes can now be found at Barneys New York, Bergdorf Goodman, Neiman Marcus and Linda Dresner.         "You can say unique and irreplaceable," Ms. Stutz added, "but in Jean's case it is literally and historically true. For years, other designers tried to copy the Jean Muir look and failed. The only ones who didn't try were the French, who called her 'la reine de la robe,' the dress queen."         Yet, Miss Muir never had formal design training. Born in London and of Scottish descent, she attended boarding school in Bedfordshire, where she was taught sewing and knitting. At 11 she started to make clothes for herself and at 19 went to work in the stockroom at Liberty, the London store. She eventually became a sketcher in the store's made-to-measure department, and she went to Jaeger as a designer in 1956.         In 1962, she became the designer for Jane & Jane, a company of young Londoners who, along with designers like Mary Quant, helped to shake up the staid British fashion world. That was when she caught the eye of Jean Rosenberg, the foresighted buyer who brought her to Bendel's.         In 1966, she formed Jean Muir Ltd. in partnership with her husband, Harry Lueckert, a former German actor she had married in 1955. In her own business she was able to develop the style of clothing that appealed to women as diverse as Princess Alexandra, Lady Antonia Fraser, Glenda Jackson, Lauren Bacall and Joanna Lumley, the co-star of the British comedy "Absolutely Fabulous," who once worked as a Jean Muir model.         She won many fashion awards, including election to the British Fashion Awards Hall of Fame last year, and was named a Commander of the British Empire in 1984. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1973. She served on the Advisory Council of the Victoria and Albert Museum from 1979 to 1983 and became a trustee the next year.         Miss Muir, who had no children, is survived by her husband. She will be buried at Lorbottle, her estate in Northumberland, 15 miles from the Scottish border. A memorial service will be held at a later date.       
         Lana Turner, who built a successful movie career on her first screen appearance as a teen-age "sweater girl," died yesterday. She was 75 and lived in Los Angeles.         "She just took a breath and she was gone," her daughter, Cheryl Crane, was quoted as saying in Daily Variety, a trade newspaper. Miss Turner, who had been treated for throat cancer, apparently died of natural causes, a police spokeswoman, Ramona Baety, confirmed to The Associated Press.         Miss Turner was discovered in 1937 by a reporter as she sipped a soda in a Hollywood ice cream parlor while cutting a secretarial class at her high school. The encounter led to her first film role, in "They Won't Forget." Wearing a skintight sweater and skirt, she sauntered along a street, spoke not one line, was murdered in the first reel and began a quick climb to stardom.         Her best performance was that of an unfulfilled wife who persuades a drifter to kill her husband, in "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (1946). Other major roles were a rebellious student in "These Glamour Girls" (1939), a shallow performer in "Ziegfeld Girl" (1941) and an alcoholic actress in "The Bad and the Beautiful" (1952).         Recalling "The Bad and the Beautiful," John Houseman, the producer, said he and Vincente Minnelli, the director, had agreed Miss Turner "was capable of brilliant individual scenes, but seemed to lack the temperament or the training to sustain a full-length performance."         "This made our episodic film just right for her," Mr. Houseman said.         Mr. Minnelli recalled using "many ruses and subterfuges" to extract a major performance from Miss Turner, adding, "As she got more into the picture her nervousness disappeared, and she effectively made the character's transition from tramp to glamour queen."         The actress, a star at MGM for 17 years, was a quintessential product of the Hollywood studio system. She recalled in 1969: "It was all beauty and it was all power. Once you had it made, they protected you; they gave you stardom. The ones who kept forging ahead became higher and higher and brighter and brighter and they were stars. And they were treated like stars. We had the best."         Her stormy personal life, peppered by many marriages and publicized romances, was as lurid as many of her films, but her identity as a sex symbol served to insulate her career from scandal's consequences. The most sensational incident occurred in 1958 when her lover, Johnny Stompanato, threatened to disfigure her and was stabbed to death with a carving knife by her 14-year-old daughter, Cheryl Crane. A jury exonerated her daughter with a finding of justifiable homicide.         Miss Turner was born on Feb. 8, 1920 in Wallace, Idaho, and was named Julia Jean Mildred Frances Turner. Her father, John, was a miner. The family soon moved to San Francisco, where her parents separated and her father was mugged and murdered. Her mother, Mildred, became a beautician and moved to Los Angeles, where the girl lived for a while in a foster home before returning to her mother.         Her discovery in a soda shop led to an interview with Mervyn LeRoy, the director and producer, who advised her to chose a catchy first name and began guiding her career. She chose Lana and began appearing in films, including "Love Finds Andy Hardy" (1938), "Calling Dr. Kildare" (1939) and "Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde." She studied with a dramatic coach and soon co-starred successfully with such leading M-G-M actors as Spencer Tracy, Clark Gable and Robert Taylor.         Her acting was often barely passable, but she was convincing in love scenes and in some melodramas. Her films included "Green Dolphin Street" (1947), "Cass Timberlane" (1947), "The Three Musketeers" (1948), "The Merry Widow" (1952), "The Rains of Ranchipur" (1955) and "Diane" (1956).         Miss Turner was nominated for an Academy Award in 1957 for her portrayal of a neurotic mother in the film adaptation of Grace Metalious's novel "Peyton Place." In many later movies, including remakes of "Imitation of Life" (1959) and "Madame X" (1966), she played heroines racked by sacrifice and suffering.         On television, her most ambitious effort was "The Survivors," a lavish, prime-time soap opera based on the Harold Robbins novel about a sordid banking family. Later, she toured in several plays, including the comedy "Forty Carats."         Miss Turner's 1982 memoir, "Lana: The Lady, the Legend, the Truth," focused on her eight marriages and many romances. The memoir also recalled a suicide attempt, two abortions, three stillbirths, alcoholism and her religious awakening in 1980.         Miss Turner was married to and divorced from Artie Shaw, the band leader; Stephen Crane, a restaurateur (they were married and divorced twice); Bob Topping, a sportsman; Lex Barker, an actor whose roles included Tarzan; Fred May, a businessman and rancher; Robert P. Eaton, a businessman, and Ronald Dante, a nightclub hypnotist.         She is survived by her daughter.

Cain's gritty novel "The Postman Always Rings Twice" (1946). Other major roles were a rebellious student in "These Glamour Girls" (1939), a shallow performer in "Ziegfeld Girl" (1941) and an alcoholic actress in the thrall of a megalomaniac Hollywood producer (Kirk Douglas) in "The Bad and the Beautiful" (1952).

More Than Just A Pretty Figure         Lana Turner made her debut as a pinup girl, but went on to establish her acting credentials in such films as "The Postman Always Rings Twice" and "Peyton Place." Here are some of the films in which she appeared. They Won't Forget 1937  Love Finds Andy Hardy 1938  Ziegfeld Girl 1941  Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde 1941  Honky Tonk 1941  Johnny Eager 1942  Slightly Dangerous 1943  The Postman Always Rings Twice 1946  Green Dolphin Street 1947  Cass Timberlane 1947  The Three Musketeers 1948  A Life of Her Own 1950  The Bad and the Beautiful 1953  Peyton Place 1957  Imitation of Life 1959  By Love Possessed 1961  Madame X 1966  Bittersweet Love 1976  Witches' Brew 1978         Correction:  July 20, 1995, Thursday         An obituary on July 1 about Lana Turner referred incorrectly to her first role, in the 1937 film "They Won't Forget." The role was not large, but Ms. Turner did speak a few lines.       
         Dr. Berta Vogel Scharrer, a pioneering biomedical scientist and founding faculty member of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, died on Sunday at her home in the Bronx. She was 88.         Harvard University, conferring an honorary doctorate on Dr. Scharrer in 1982, said her "research journeys into the world of insects have profoundly affected the study of human physiology." The particular insect she had studied since 1937 was the South American cockroach.         Dr. Scharrer's specialty was neuroendocrinology, the study of the interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems. At her death, she was distinguished professor emeritus of anatomy and structural biology and of neuroscience at Einstein. She had been affiliated with the college since it was founded in 1955. She reached emeritus status in 1978 but continued her research until a few months ago.         In 1928, Dr. Ernst Scharrer, her future husband, working in Germany, discovered what he called gland-nerve cells in the hypothalamus of a fish's brain. From this, the Scharrers developed the concept of neurosecretion -- secretions from nerve cells -- that gave rise in the 1930's and early 1940's to neuroendocrinology as a new discipline.         Berta Vogel was born in Munich, Germany, and received a doctorate in biology from the University of Munich in 1930. She married Dr. Scharrer in 1934, and they remained a team at Einstein until his accidental drowning in 1965. Though not Jewish, the Scharrers left Germany in 1937 because of Hitler's policies.         Early in their collaboration, they decided on a comparative approach, dividing the animal kingdom so that he would study vertebrates and she invertebrates. They determined that certain principles found in an insect could explain certain things about mammalian systems, and vice versa.         Their discovery of neurosecretions took years to find acceptance, as their peers resisted the notion that neurons could dispatch neurohormonal, blood-borne signals, an activity previously associated only with the hormonal endocrine cells.         Once neuroendocrinology became established, Dr. Scharrer received many honorary degrees and other honors in the United States and in Europe. She was given the National Medal of Science at a White House ceremony in 1985.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Karl Vogel of Neustadt, Germany, and a sister, Lotte Vogel of Munich.       
         Mary Polak Oenslager, a philanthropist who supported the city's cultural institutions and helped causes from women's health to the visually impaired, died last Sunday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 98.         She endowed programs at several institutions that provide health care for women, like the Maternity Center Association on East 92d Street and Long Island College Hospital. The victim of an eye condition that left her nearly blind in midlife, she recovered her sight in one of the first cornea transplants and became a founder of Recordings for the Blind and a sponsor of blind university graduates.         Among her beneficiaries were the New York Philharmonic and its Free Concerts in the parks program, the Metropolitan Opera, the New York City Opera, the Metropolitan Museum, the Brooklyn Museum and the American Museum of Natural History.         She was the widow of Donald M. Oenslager, a theatrical designer, who died in 1975. She and her husband gave their collection of prints of theaters, costumes and stage sets to the Pierpont Morgan Library, of which she was a Fellow in Perpetuity. She also was a Conservator of the New York Public Library.         Mrs. Oenslager is survived by her brother-in-law, Malcolm G. Chace Jr. of North Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Adele Simpson, an important player in the postwar fashion movement, died yesterday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 91.         Mrs. Simpson took French couture and gave it an American ready-to-wear interpretation. Her color-coordinated dresses and jackets and well-cut coats in fine fabrics found favor among well-heeled women of her time in search of classic clothes that did not cost a month's rent.         Mrs. Simpson's popularity spanned more than three decades, from the late 1940's through the 1970's. Her coming of age as a designer mirrored the development of American sportswear, which was defining itself and growing in importance as the mass-market technology that followed World War II left its mark on fashion.         Lady Bird Johnson, Pat Nixon and Barbara Bush were among those who wore her designs, and her collections were available in some of the nation's finest stores, including Bonwit Teller, B. Altman and Saks Fifth Avenue.         "She made clothes for ladies," said Helen O'Hagan, a fashion publicist who once worked at Saks. "They were beautifully made and designed. It wasn't advanced, but that wasn't who she was after."         Mrs. Simpson was born Adele Smithline in New York City, the fifth daughter of Latvian immigrants. In 1927, she married Wesley Simpson, a textile executive.         At 21, after completing design studies at Pratt Institute, she replaced her older sister Anna as head designer for Ben Girshel, then an important Seventh Avenue manufacturer. A few years later, she went to work for Mary Lee, another Seventh Avenue manufacturer. In 1949, she bought the company and renamed it Adele Simpson.         As was the practice of the day, she traveled regularly to Paris to gather inspiration and copy French designs.         Mrs. Simpson was the recipient of numerous fashion accolades, including the Coty American Fashion Critics award in 1947.         For the wedding of President Lyndon B. Johnson's daughter Luci, in 1966, Mrs. Simpson designed for the mother of the bride a wrinkle-resistant yellow silk street-length coat, matching princess-line dress and hat. This ensemble, with it color coordination and clean, practical lines, was typical of Mrs. Simpson's concept of fashion.         She continued designing into her 70's, retiring in 1985. Her daughter, Joan Raines, and son-in-law, Richard Raines, ran the business after her retirement. In 1991, the family sold the business to Barron Peters, a clothing company in Lowell, Mass., which has since filed for bankruptcy and discontinued the Adele Simpson line.         Mrs. Simpson's husband died in 1976.         In addition to her daughter, Joan, of Manhattan, Mrs. Simpson is survived by a son, Jeffrey, also of Manhattan, and three grandsons.       
         Alice Greenough Orr, who broke horses as a youngster on a Montana ranch, delivered mail through snowdrifts on horseback as a teen-ager and later reigned for two decades as the rodeo queen of the bronc riders, died on Sunday at her home in Tucson, Ariz. She was 93 and a member of both the Cowboy and the Cowgirl Halls of Fame.         In a career that took her from the wilds of Montana to Madison Square Garden and the capitals of Europe, Mrs. Orr was always at home on a horse. If it was bucking, so much the better.         When she was a child growing up on a ranch near Red Lodge, Mont., her father regularly gave her wild horses, knowing that by the time they got tired of trying to dislodge his tenacious daughter, they would be tame enough for regular people to ride.         In time, her skill would lead to four world saddle bronc championships and make her a star attraction on rodeo tours in the United States, Australia and Europe.         Although bronc riding was her specialty, she and her little sister, Marge Henderson, excelled at virtually every rodeo event from trick riding to bull riding. Together with their brothers Bill and Turk, they became known as the Riding Greenoughs. Like Turk, a legendary bronc rider who died in June at the age of 89, Mrs. Orr also did occasional stunt work for the movies.         Her skill brought her considerable attention. On one European tour in the 1930's she had tea with the Queen of England, and, without benefit of sword, rode fighting bulls into Spanish arenas before dismounting and leaving them to the matadors.         Mrs. Orr, who once said she had been "born liberated," dropped out of school to take over a 35-mile rural mail route at the age of 14. She kept the route for three winters and two summers and had her heart set on a career as a forest ranger until the return of servicemen from World War I closed off such employment opportunities for women.         After the failure of her marriage to Ray Cahill, which produced two children, Mrs. Orr was working in a rooming house in 1929 when she read an advertisement for bronc riders for a wild west show, the precursor of modern rodeos.         She and her sister answered the advertisement and were hired on the spot.         Early competitors were sometimes shortchanged by tour operators, at least until 1936, when Mrs. Orr and others formed what is now known as the Professional Rodeo Cowboys Association.         In the 1940's she and her second husband, Joe Orr, operated their own rodeos, with Mrs. Orr providing exhibitions of saddle bronc riding, a specialty that rodeo experts say requires so much more skill and finesse than bareback riding that it no longer exists as a competitive event on the women's rodeo circuit.         Mrs. Orr retired from rodeos in 1954, but continued to accept occasional movie assignments until she was 80. She climbed into the saddle for the last time in 1992 when she rode in a parade in Red Lodge, where few of those who lined the route could remember the time when it was a girl on horseback who delivered the mail.         In addition to her sister, also of Tucson, she is survived by a son, Jay Cahill of Grandview, Mo.; 11 grandchildren, 12 great-grandchildren and 2 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Florene May Schoenborn, a benefactor and life trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, to which she gave dozens of paintings collected over the years by her and her second husband, Samuel A. Marx, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         The couple came to own what was among the most distinguished collections of modern art in private hands. The collection included the most outstanding collection of early works by Matisse outside Russia, the museum said.         Mrs. Schoenborn became a museum trustee in 1953 and served on the program and drawing comittees. She was a founding member of the museum's international council in 1954.         She was born in Denver. Her father was David May Sr., the founder of May Department Stores, who started his chain in Leadville, Colo. As a young woman, she hoped to study journalism at Columbia University but her father would not permit her to attend.         Forty-four of her paintings were shown at the Museum of Modern Art in a 1965 exhibition, "The School of Paris: Paintings From the Florene May Schoenborn and Samuel A. Marx Collection." Mr. Marx, a successful Chicago architect, died in 1964.         Mrs. Schoenborn donated many important paintings, drawings, sculptures and prints to the museum. The core of her contributions consisted of five paintings by Matisse: "Moroccan Garden" (1912), "Woman on a High Stool" (1914), "Artist and Goldfish" (1914), "Variation on a Still Life by De Heen" (1915) and "The Moroccans" (1915).         The gallery showing Matisse works from the museum's permanent collection was named the Florene May Schoenborn Gallery in 1986.         Her first marriage, to Martin Straus, an advertising executive, ended in divorce. Her third husband, Wolfgang Schoenborn, a developer who helped to turn the old Pacific port of Acapulco into a fashionable resort, died in 1986.         She is survived by five grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 1, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Saturday about Florene May Schoenborn, a benefactor and life trustee of the Museum of Modern Art, misstated the number of paintings she gave to the museum. Her gifts included five paintings by Matisse and drawings, sculptures and prints by many other artists, not dozens of paintings.       
         Evelyn Wood, whose search for a way to improve the lives of troubled girls led to the development of speed reading techniques prescribed by Presidents and endorsed by multitudes, died on Saturday in Hospice Family Care in Tucson, Ariz. Mrs. Wood, who lived in Tucson, was 86.         The tiny, soft-spoken woman who gave her name to Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics liberated students, professionals and business people from the habits that shackled them to the average American's reading rate of 250 to 300 words a minute.         In courses that proliferated from coast to coast and spread overseas, they learned the methods that enabled them not only to read two to five times faster but also to better retain what they read.         "So many people are dubious about trying my method because they think they're liable to miss a lot," Mrs. Wood said in an interview a quarter of a century ago. "I say, which would you rather do: eat a dish of rice kernel by kernel or take a spoonful to get a good taste? My reading technique is actually comprehension by accumulation."         In years of research ignited by a professor who read her 80-page term paper at an astonishing rate while retaining its content, she found people from all walks of life who could read from 1,500 to 6,000 words a minute and sometimes more. And Mrs. Wood (who could herself read 2,700 words a minute), discovered that they shared several traits:         *They read down the page rather than left to right.         *They read groups of words or complete thoughts rather than one word at a time.         *They avoided involuntary rereading of material.         *Their reading efficiency was applicable to a variety of materials.         In time, President John F. Kennedy sent a dozen members of the White House staff to the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute in Washington. President Richard M. Nixon sent 35 high-ranking members of his Administration, and President Jimmy Carter followed suit.         Students learned to break the habits that slowed them, including saying words under their breath, or subvocalizing. And the hand or finger, sweeping down the page, was used to "pace" the eyes at increasingly faster speeds, while the reader was urged to concentrate not on single words but on groups of words -- sentences, clauses and the like -- that make up units of thought.         At one session, a college student devoured a sociology textbook at the rate of 14,000 words a minute. In another, 25 students were assigned to finish George Orwell's "Animal Farm" in 25 minutes, a feat that required a reading rate of 1,400 words a minute. Most finished in the allotted time, and most scored well on the comprehension test that followed.         There were few claims that extremely difficult or unfamiliar material could be mastered at accelerated rates. But it was clear that many people could be taught to read faster and more effectively.         "Speed is not most important, but only through speed do you get good comprehension," Mrs. Wood said.         It was a theory that Mrs. Wood began to develop during the late 1940's and early 1950's, when she was a teacher and girls' counselor at Jordan High School in Salt Lake City.         Dealing with underachievers with personality problems, Mrs. Wood realized that they had one thing in common. All were poor readers.         Mrs. Wood established the school's first remedial reading program and discovered that as the girls read better, their grades improved in every subject and they became better adjusted.         And she discovered one other thing: the faster the girls read, the better they read.         She began refining her techniques for faster reading.         The next breakthrough came when Mrs. Wood, who was born in 1909 in Logan, Utah, returned to the University of Utah. At the college where she had earned her bachelor's degree in English in 1929, she now pursued a master's degree in speech.         When she turned in her term paper to the head of the department, Dr. C. Lowell Lees, she recalled:         "I handed Dr. Lees a term paper and watched him flip through the 80 pages at a startling rate, grade the paper and hand it back. He appeared to be reading as fast as he could turn the pages. He knew the total content and was able to tell me not only what was in it, but also what was missing. Intrigued, I clocked him on other material and found he could read at a rate of 2,500 words a minute."         In 1958, when she was sent on a national promotional tour for "Reading Skills," a groundbreaking book on remedial reading written in collaboration with Marjorie Westcott Barrows of Jordan High, Mrs. Wood began asking everywhere, "Do you know anyone who can read fast?"         The answers led her to 53 people whose traits came to inform her teaching.         Later that summer, frustrated with her efforts to increase her own reading speed, she discovered the use of the hand as a pacer.         "Before I introduced that technique," she once told an interviewer, "only children in the early grades used their fingers on the printed pages to guide their reading. And then they were taught not to!"         In 1959, with her husband, Doug, Mrs. Wood established the first of her institutes, in Washington. In 1967, she sold the business. It has been owned since September 1993 by Pryor Resources, a business seminar training company in Kansas City, Kan.         Mrs. Wood continued to teach and was developing a remedial reading program for children when she suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1976.         Her husband died in 1987. She is survived by her daughter, Carol Davis Evans of Tucson; four grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.       
         Helen K. Nearing, who with her husband, Scott Nearing, wrote about leaving the congested streets of Manhattan to find peace and happiness through hard work and self-sufficiency on a New England farm, died on Sunday in an automobile accident near her home in Harborside, Me. She was 91.         Mrs. Nearing, whose husband died at 100 in 1983, had continued to live alone in the farmhouse they built 40 years ago overlooking Penobscot Bay. She was killed when a car she was driving struck a tree, said Eliot Coleman, a friend who lives on a neighboring farm.         Between them, Mrs. Nearing and her husband wrote more than 50 books during their half-century of homesteading, including "Living the Good Life" and "Continuing the Good Life," written initially in pamphlet form and then published by Schocken in 1954 and 1970, respectively.         Although written shortly after the Depression, both books became primers for thousands of urbanites who dropped out of the corporate world in the early 1970's and headed for the quiet countryside.         Followers describe the Nearings as the "senior gurus" of the back-to-the-land movement.         "Materialism does not produce happiness," Mrs. Nearing told those who came to tour her Forest Farm and marvel that, in an age of mass communications, she still made do without radio or television.         "She gave in and had a telephone installed about 10 years ago so she could keep in touch with all her friends around the world," said Mr. Coleman, who with his wife, Barbara Damrosch, is host of a cable television series called "Natural Gardening."         A lifelong vegetarian, Mrs. Nearing also did not take aspirin or use a credit card. Instead, she helped to restore the soil of her farm, build a stone farmhouse and outbuildings and plant an organic garden. In her pantry, she filled barrels with flour and sugar, much like New England dwellers a hundred or more years before her.         "In November, the rafters in our big country kitchen are hung with braids of onions and shallots, with ears of dried corn, with drying herbs (mint, tarragon, thyme, parsley, celery, sage and lovage)," she once wrote in a letter to The New York Times.         "Of bottled canned goods in the kitchen cellar, we have 160 quarts of vegatable soup and tomato juice, 132 quarts of rose hips, 80 quarts of applesauce, 146 quarts of raspberries, and jars and jars of jam," she wrote.         Mrs. Nearing drew a parallel between the people who immigrated to New England in the 1700's and "the many young people of today who find no satisfactory way to exercise or develop their talents and interests in modern city or suburb."         "They are willing and eager to clear their land, build their homes, dig and cultivate their own gardens and subsist on their own work," she said. "They are finding out that it is possible to live daily self-sufficient lives even in the middle of the 20th century."         Believing in the adage "waste not, want not," she wrote about all her experiences, providing New Age homesteaders with 10- and 20-year projects leading toward "the good life."         "The Maple Sugar Book," which she wrote with her husband and which was published by Schocken in 1950, told not only of the art and history of sugaring but also of the practical details of sugar making.         Another primer, "Building and Using Our Sun-Heated Greenhouse," published in 1971 by Dutton and now out of print, told of how to grow vegetables year-round in New England without artificial heating.         Among the books that Mrs. Nearing wrote alone were "Wise Words on the Good Life" (Schocken, 1983) and "Simple Food for the Good Life" (Stillpoint, 1983), which she described as "an anti-cooking book that advocates fresh raw foods and minimal cooking."         Her latest work, to be published this month by Tilbury House, "Light on Aging and Dying," is a collection of quotations inspired by the death of her husband 12 years ago.         Mrs. Nearing, who was born in Ridgewood, N.J., graduated from Ridgewood High School, then traveled extensively aboard, studying the violin, which she gave up for gardening when she married Mr. Nearing.         The Nearings began their long journey in search of the good life in 1932, when Mr. Nearing, a professor of economics, left the academic world and moved far away from New York City and the Depression to the wilderness of Vermont, where they built their first farm.         Twenty years later, feeling crowded by a nearby ski lift and growing tourism, they headed for Maine.  They kept a car and a pickup truck but permitted no machines on the farm that were not run by human or animal power.         According to the Nearings' wishes, an education and retreat center is to be established on Forest Farm after their deaths. The nonprofit center, to be called the Good Life Center, is to be administered and financed in part by the Trust for Public Land of Boston, an organization that preserves rural sites and crafts.         The Social Science Institute, formed in 1953 to print political and economic pamphlets written by Mr. Nearing, will become part of the Good Life Center.         Mrs. Nearing is survived by a sister, Alice Vaughan of Dorset, Vt.; a niece, Barbara Tuttle, and a nephew, C. B. Vaughan, both of Dorset, and a stepson, Robert Nearing of Troy, Pa.         A memorial service will be held at 2 P.M. on Sunday, Oct. 1, at the Brookville Community Center in South Brookville, Me.       
         Joanne Toor Cummings, a philanthropist and patron of the arts, died yesterday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, according to the family.         Mrs. Cummings and her husband, Nathan Cummings, the founder of the Consolidated Foods Corporation, who died in 1985, were longtime collectors. The Cummingses gave more than 600 pieces of pre-Columbian works to a gallery bearing his name at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Their apartment overlooking Fifth Avenue was filled with an array of sculpture by Giacometti and Manzu and paintings by Matisse, Gauguin and Degas.         They also made substantial contributions to the Mount Sinai Medical Center, New York Hospital, Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and other hospitals.         Mrs. Cummings was born in Chicago, the daughter of Harriet Toor and Harold Toor, former chairman of the United States Shoe Corporation.         She graduated in 1953 from Connecticut College, to which she and her husband donated the Joanne and Nathan Cummings Art Center and endowed a scholarship for needy students. She served as a trustee of the college from 1981 to 1991.         She also received a master's degree from Columbia University's School of International Relations. She was a member of the National Committee on American Foreign Policy for 19 years, and its senior vice president since 1991.         Mrs. Cummings was involved in a wide variety of philanthropies. She was a life governing member of the Chicago Art Institute and a patron of the American Ballet Theater, New York City Ballet, New York City Opera, Metropolitan Opera and Metropolitan Museum of Art.         She is survived by a sister, Suzanne Toor Karpas of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Dickson, an American-born musical comedy performer who captivated British audiences in the 1920's and 30's and became a member of the country's theatrical and social elite, died on Monday at her home in London. She was 102.         Until her friend Michael Thornton, the British biographer, tracked down her birth certificate, it had been assumed that Miss Dickson was born on July 20, 1900, the date given in a standard reference work.         But that would have made her a mere 14 in 1914, when as a Chicago debutante she scandalized North Shore society by dropping out of Madame Young's finishing school to form a dance team with Carl Hyson, a wealthy young man who later became her husband.         Before the season was over the pair claimed a long-distance tango record by dancing the equivalent of 22,000 miles at clubs in Chicago, Milwaukee and New York.         A 1900 birth date would also have meant that Miss Dickson was only 16 on Feb. 20, 1917, when she opened as a featured dancer in "Oh Boy!," a Jerome Kern hit that ran for 463 performances at the Princess Theater in New York.         Although she became a Ziegfeld girl and appeared in other Broadway shows, including Kern's "Rock-a-Bye Baby" in 1918, it was not until she got to England in 1921 as the lead in the London company of "Sally" that she became a star. Playing the part made famous by Marilyn Miller in New York a year earlier, Miss Dickson introduced the Kern standard "Look for the Silver Lining" to British audiences, and was a darling of the West End from then on.         She and the show were so successful that Kern and P. G. Wodehouse wrote another one especially for her. "The Cabaret Girl" ran for 361 performances at the Wintergarden Theater there.         It was during the "Cabaret Girl" run that Miss Dickson made one of her most important British conquests, a lasting friendship with Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon, who was so enchanted with Miss Dickson that she took her fiance to a performance. The fiance, then the Duke of York, eventually became King George VI. The former Lady Elizabeth is the Queen Mother of Britain.         At a birthday lunch Miss Dickson gave at her home in 1980, the Queen Mother demonstrated her own musical-comedy talents by singing a "Cabaret Girl" tune, "Dancing Time." She sent roses for Miss Dickson's 100th-birthday celebration two years ago.         Miss Dickson appeared in many other London productions, including a 1925 revival of "Peter Pan." She also became friends with Noel Coward and other theater luminaries. When she filed for divorce from Mr. Hyson in 1935, it was reported that Miss Dickson was expected to marry a British peer. In fact she never remarried.         Although her career had faded considerably by the 1940's, Miss Dickson re-emerged as a founder of the London Stage Door Canteen, which entertained thousands of Allied troops during World War II.         Her last theater roles were in "Red Letter Day" and "As Long as They Are Happy," in 1953, and she made her last stage appearance in 1980 during a 75th-anniversary celebration of "Peter Pan."         A dedicated Christian Scientist who made daily walks from her Eaton Square apartment to a reading room until she was well into her 90's, Miss Dickson remained a familiar and sprightly figure in London.         In addition to Miss Quayle, she is survived by her daughter, Lady Quayle, the widow of the actor Anthony Quayle; two other grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 29, 1995, Friday         Because of an editing error, an obituary on Wednesday about Dorothy Dickson, a former musical comedy star, referred incompletely to one survivor. She is the actress Jenny Quayle, a granddaughter.       
         Anyone attending the inauguration this weekend of Ruth Simmons as Smith College's ninth president will be likely to note the presence of such luminaries as Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning author; Johnnetta Cole, the president of Spelman College; Cornel West, the scholar, and Henry Louis Gates, the writer and chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard.         But they might miss the people who Ruth Simmons believes are the most important -- those responsible for her becoming the first black president of one of the country's most elite women's colleges. They are her nine brothers and sisters: Elbert, Wilford, Atherine, Albert, Arnold, Nora, Clarence, Ozella and Azella. Her eighth-grade teacher, Modria Caraway. Her high school drama teacher, Vernell Lillie.         Her kindergarten teacher, Ida Mae Henderson, would like to be there, but at age 85, she is not strong enough to make the trip alone from Grapeland, Tex. "Miss Ida Mae," Dr. Simmons said. "I revere her."         Dr. Simmons, who is 50, is the great-great-granddaughter of slaves. She began her journey on a cotton farm in Grapeland, in East Texas. Her parents, the late Isaac and Fannie Stubblefield, were sharecroppers. Dr. Simmons was the youngest of 12 children -- two brothers are dead -- and was 7 when the family moved to a poor section of Houston. Her father went to work in a factory and eventually became pastor of the Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church. Her mother scrubbed floors for white families.         To Henry Louis Gates, the appointment of a black woman to the top job at Smith is "a major event in the history of American letters." Professor Gates, who regards Dr. Simmons as a mentor, said, "She's the Jackie Robinson of college presidents."         Ask Ruth Simmons how she did it, how she made her way from Grapeland to the provost's job at Spelman College to vice provost at Princeton University to the presidency of Smith, and she seems startled by the question. "I didn't make it happen," she said in an interview the other day in her wood-paneled office at Smith. "That's just the point."         It was her teachers at the segregated schools she attended, W. R. Banks Elementary in Grapeland and Phyllis Wheatley High in Houston, who made it happen, she said. "They thought I belonged in college," she said. "And they were convinced they would get me there. They protected me, especially after my mother died."         She was 15 when her mother lost her battle with kidney disease. "I had a remarkable mother," said Dr. Simmons, who is 50. "When she would do day's work, she would sometimes take me with her to white people's houses when I was a little girl. The thing I remember vividly is how good she was at what she did. She was very demanding in terms of her own work -- Do it well, do it thoroughly, whatever you do."         After graduation from high school, she went to Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, where she majored in Romance languages.         "Vernell Lillie wrote to Dillard, which is where she had gone, and asked them to provide a scholarship for me," Dr. Simmons said.         Ms. Lillie, a professor of African studies at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview: "She was brilliant. I was very fortunate to be a part of her life."         The scholarship did not cover everything. "I didn't have enough money to buy clothes," said Dr. Simmons, who was elegantly dressed the other morning in a long, dark-green pleated skirt and matching jacket, with a double strand of pearls and small gold hoop earrings. "And I'll never forget one of my teachers asked me to come over to her house, and she went to her closet and she took enough clothes out for me to go to college."         Her family pitched in, too. "My brothers and sisters would send me what they could," she said. "They were all starting families. Sometimes it would be $5, or $10."         Her brother Wilford Stubblefield, who is 16 years older, was working at an oil refinery in Houston as a janitor, the only job open to a black man at the refinery in those days.         "We all helped her -- probably not as much as we should have," Wilford said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Houston. "She was the second one that had gone off to college. Naturally, we were proud."         Another brother, Clarence Stubblefield, who is 54 and a high school basketball coach in Houston, had gone to Prairie View College in Texas on a basketball scholarship.         Dr. Simmons said: "I'm not the brightest person in my family. I was very lucky. I came along at the right time."         Growing up in the segregated South, she said, she had no specific ambition, only a hunger to learn. "One really didn't aspire to do professional things," she said. "I think my mother must have thought that eventually perhaps I would get enough education to be self-sustaining and to do something comfortable, perhaps housework."         Instead, she earned an undergraduate degree from Dillard, and master's and doctorate degrees in Romance languages at Harvard. She became an assistant professor of French, and later an assistant dean at the University of New Orleans.         In the meantime, at age 22, she married Norbert Simmons, a lawyer and businessman. They had a son, Khari, now 22 and a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and a daughter, Maya, 18, who plans to attend Spelman next year.         After the couple separated in the mid-1980's -- they were divorced in 1989 -- Dr. Simmons began her administrative rise at Princeton. She brought Ms. Morrison and Professor West to the Princeton faculty. She tried to persuade Professor Gates to join the faculty, too, he said.         There was one problem with Ms. Morrison's appointment: the faculty search committee wanted a resume. And Ms. Morrison, offended by the request, refused to submit one.         So Ruth Simmons wrote Toni Morrison's resume for her. "Here's my philosophy about life," said Dr. Simmons, who considers Ms. Morrison her best friend. "Don't dwell on insignificant things."         Ms. Morrison said in a telephone interview: "She's still a bit of a miracle as far as I'm concerned. She has an unusual combination of real politics and integrity, and this very keen sense of morals which does not interfere with her generosity and her wide spiritedness. She's extremely creative in terms of solving other people's problems. And she's a lot of fun."         For the 14-member presidential search committee at Smith, Dr. Simmons was the unanimous first choice. "We had a wish list of the qualities we wanted," said one member of the committee, Peter Rose, a sociology professor. "She seemed to fill them all. Race was not an issue."         Of Smith's 2,800 students, 86 are black. There are 15 black faculty members -- out of 300.         One goals, Dr. Simmons said, is to interest more black women in Smith. She hopes her presence will help. "If it's not a good place for African-American students," she said, "it's not a good place for me."         Her friend, Professor Gates, said he was already planning ahead. "I'm hoping Maggie and Liza Gates will go to Smith now," he said, referring to his teen-age daughters. "It never would have occurred to me before Ruth became president."         For now, her presence has electrified the campus. She walks everywhere. She invites students into her office to talk. She listens to them, they say.         Tigress Osborne, a black senior, said she returned to Smith last spring after taking some time off. "One of my friends said, 'You won't believe what's happened: we have a black president!' " Ms. Osborne said. "There's a moment when you think if Smith picked a black woman, how black is she? Is she going to be interested in us?"         She added, "But there's a real sense of her blackness. She also has a good handle on how to be not just the black president, on how not to cater to just black students."         Watching Dr. Simmons mingle at the senior tea last week, one senior, Kathryn Fields, who is white, said: "She's so cool. She's so young. She's new, she's exciting, she's going to make this school amazing."         At her inauguration, the new president will be carrying a Bible her mother gave her father on the day they were married.         "I know the board of trustees thinks I'm trying to live up to the standards they set for me, and that's O.K.," she said. But she is aiming toward the higher standard set for her by Fannie Stubblefield, who never had the chance to go beyond the seventh grade. "Every day that I'm here," Dr. Simmons said, "I try to be worthy of the kind of person my mother wanted me to be."       
         Alison Steele, whose sultry voice and iron will helped her become one of the first women in the country to be hired as a disk jockey, died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 58.         Ms. Steele, who lived in Manhattan, died of cancer, her family said.         She was widely known to late-night radio listeners as "the Nightbird." Her most recent perch was WXRK, a classic rock-and-roll station at 92.3 FM. She was on Monday through Friday from 2 to 6 A.M.         Ms. Steele loved to work hours that most other people find good for sleeping. "I'm a night person," she said in 1971, when she was with WNEW, where she worked on AM and FM for about 14 years. "I think it has a mysterious quality. I never get lonely up here."         She usually received 25 to 30 telephone calls a night; in her early years, she also had her champagne-colored French poodle, Genya, to keep her company, chewing on a bone in the studio as Ms. Steele talked to listeners.         Ms. Steele also worked for WPIX radio and often did voice-overs for radio and television commercials, according to her sister, Joyce Loman. Her syrupy voice was not affected by a flirtation with miniature cigars that she indulged in her early days on radio but gave up years ago, her sister said.         Ms. Steele and her sister operated Just Cats, a feline boutique on East 60th Street in Manhattan, but Ms. Steele was fond of dogs as well.         She is a member of the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland and in 1976 became the first woman to receive Billboard Magazine's "FM Personality of the Year" award.         Ms. Steele was born in Brooklyn. At 14, she was an errand girl for a New York television station. Later she became a production assistant and associate producer at a New York radio station.         Her big break came in 1966, when she was one of four chosen from about 800 to be part of a disk jockey lineup made up solely of women on WNEW-FM. The station abandoned that idea 18 months later but asked one woman, Ms. Steele, to stay on.         "I've never called in sick; I've worked hard and built my own following," she once said, to explain her popularity.         A marriage to the bandleader Ted Steele ended in divorce.         In addition to her sister Joyce, of Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Heather Steele, of South Dakota; another sister, Emalie Daniel, of Houston, and a granddaughter.       
         Annie Kriegel, a French ex-Communist who was a historian and analyst of Communism, died on Aug. 26 in a Paris hospital. She was 68 and lived in Paris.         She had cancer, said the French newspaper Le Figaro, which reported her death on Aug. 28.         Professor Kriegel had retired from academic work after teaching at the University of Paris-Nanterre from 1969 into the 1990's.         As a teen-ager, she was active in the Resistance against the Nazi occupation of her country. She became prominent in the postwar French Communist Party but resigned in 1957.         Her 1972 book, "The French Communists," was hailed in The New York Times Book review by an American historian of France, Robert O. Paxton of Columbia University, as "the most probing single work on the French Communist Party, and perhaps on any Western Communist party." She wrote more than a dozen books, beginning in 1964.         A British historian of France, Douglas Johnson, wrote in The Independent on Friday that Professor Kriegel was respected as an individual force among French intellectuals.         Professor Johnson -- whose French-born wife, Madeleine, roomed with Professor Kriegel in the 1940's -- said the explanation for her "remarkable career is to be found in her wartime experience" and gave this account:         "Coming from a Jewish-Alsatian family and having passed idyllic school days in the Marais district of Paris, she encountered the anti-Semitic legislation of the occupation and then the infamous roundup of Jews on 16 July 1942.         "As the men were forcibly separated from the women and children, she heard screams which she said contained all the pain that life and death provide. She sat on a bench and wept. 'It was on that bench that I left my childhood,' she afterwards said."         Then she escaped Paris and joined a Communist Resistance group. After the war she studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Sevres, held posts in teaching and related fields and wrote for Le Figaro.         Annie Becker Kriegel was born in Paris. Her marriage to Guy Besse ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband of 40 years, Dr. Arthur Kriegel; and four children, Maurice, Danielle, Irene and Emmanuel.       
         Mary Alice Barney Kean, who was long prominent in the historical preservation field, died on Monday at her 223-year-old home, Liberty Hall in Union, N.J. She was 93.         At her death, Mrs. Kean (pronounced cane) was president of the Elizabethtown Historical Foundation in New Jersey. She became the first female trustee of the New-York Historical Society and remained a trustee from 1967 to 1984. Liberty Hall was built for her ancestor William Livingston, New Jersey's first Governor after the American Revolution.         From 1956 through 1960, she was the president general -- the ranking officer -- of the Colonial Dames of America, a Manhattan-based society whose members trace their ancestry to Colonial times. The Colonial Dames own the site on East 61st Street that includes what is now the Abigail Adams Smith Museum, which once stood on an estate owned by President John Adams's daughter Abigail and her husband.         In addition, Mrs. Kean was a governor of the New Jersey Historical Society, which gave her an award for her historic-preservation work. She was active in preservation projects as far afield as Virginia.         Over the years, she was also president of the New York Chapter of the Descendants of the Signers of the Declaration of Independence, a directress general of the Society of Daughters of Holland Dames and a trustee of St. Bernard's School in Manhattan and of Cooper Union.         Mr. Kean died in 1949, at 60. He was president of the National State Bank, the Elizabethtown Consolidated Gas Company and the Elizabethtown Water Company, all in Elizabeth, N.J. Thomas H. Kean, the former Governor of New Jersey, is his nephew.         Mrs. Kean is survived by a daughter, Mary Alice Raynolds of Lander, Wyo.; two sons, John, of Vero Beach, Fla., and Stewart, of Union, N.J., 9 grandchildren and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Genora Johnson Dollinger, who rallied support for the hard-fought strike that gave the United Auto Workers union its foothold at the General Motors Company in 1937, died on Wednesday at Cedar Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 82 and had lived in Los Angeles since 1966.         Mrs. Dollinger was 23 when she organized the Women's Auxiliary of the U.A.W. and the Women's Emergency Brigade to feed and shield 2,000 strikers occupying a crucial Fisher Body Division plant in Flint, Mich. The strike began on Christmas Eve 1936 and ended 44 days later with the company's recognition of the union as bargaining agent for its work force.         The strike crippled General Motors, and its settlement proved a stellar event for the whole labor movement because it gave new stature to unions representing industrial workers.         Mrs. Dollinger's first husband, Kermit Johnson, was the only member of a citywide strike committee actually employed at the Fisher plant chosen for the strike. When spirits flagged during the long confrontation, her resolve stiffened the will of the "sitdowners."         Her women's auxiliaries went house-to-house to calm worried mothers and wives and gain their support. They also collected cash and food for their soup kitchens. And she had her women's brigade, wielding clubs, marching up and down the iron main gate and barricade to put their bodies between Pinkerton agents and their men inside.         In an interview with Studs Terkel for his most recent book, "Coming of Age" (New Press, 1995), she recalled how she and four of her unarmed lieutenants once stalled the police.         "Beating an unarmed woman was a different story in those days," she said. "We looked up and here came the emergency brigade, the Red Berets. We called ourselves that because of our red berets, red arm bands with white letters: EB. They were carrying the American flag and singing 'Solidarity Forever' and 'Hold the Fort'."         She said she was blacklisted in Flint and moved to Detroit and a job at the Briggs Manufacturing Company, a Chrysler supplier. She became a leader in a militant unit of the U.A.W. and was dismissed and rehired after thousands of Briggs workers went on strike for her.         Born in Kalamazoo, Mich., she grew up in Flint and, by age 18, was a charter member of the Flint Socialist Party. The party later turned into a catalyst for the strikes, which were widely denounced as Communist inspired.         Mrs. Dollinger continued as a union organizer. She fell victim to a lead-pipe attack in a wave of anti-union violence that included the shootings of Walter and Victor Reuther, both veterans of the 1937 strike at G.M.         She was inducted into the Hall of Fame of the Michigan Women's Historical Center in Lansing last year.         Besides her husband of 51 years, Sol Dollinger, Mrs. Dollinger is survived by their son, Ronald, also of Los Angeles, and two grandchildren. Her first marriage ended in divorce.       
         Linda Goodman, whose down-to-earth insights into character traits were credited with bringing astrology out of the occult section and onto the best-seller lists with the 1968 publication of "Sun Signs," died on Saturday at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs. She was about 70 and lived in Cripple Creek.         The hospital said the cause was complications of diabetes.         It may have been "the dawning of the age of Aquarius," as the 1960's song put it, but until Mrs. Goodman, a one-time newspaper reporter and sometime radio writer who had picked up an interest in astrology from grocery store booklets, sat down at her typewriter, the rays had not caused a blink in the publishing industry.         Within months after an obscure house named Taplinger brought out "Sun Signs," in 1968, it had become the first book on astrology to make The New York Times Best-Seller List.         Since then, her agent, Arthur Klebanoff, said yesterday, "Sun Signs," and two follow-up volumes, "Love Signs," (1978) and "Star Signs," (1988) have sold more than 30 million copies in 15 languages and continue to sell some 200,000 copies a year.         The $2.3 million paid for the paperback rights to "Love Signs" set an industry record.         What set Mrs. Goodman's books apart was a combination of her sharp insights and her elegant, accessible style.         Writing in the first person and drawing on the lives of celebrities, historical figures and personal friends to illustrate her points, Mrs. Goodman sometimes seemed more psychologist than astrologer.         Whether your sweetheart's streak of, say, stubbornness, came from the stars or childhood experiences, Mrs. Goodman was a master in elaborating how it would play out against your own tendencies as a dreamer.         Mrs. Goodman, whose original name was Mary Alice Kemery, was born in Morgantown, W. Va., on a date she gave as April 19 in a year she would never disclose.         "I once asked my grandfather, and he wouldn't tell me either," her son Michael Goodman said yesterday. During an interview a few years ago, Mrs. Goodman was more forthcoming, putting her age "between 435 and 450."         The date made her a triple Aries, and Mrs. Goodman, a five-foot-or-so dynamo fit the astrological profile to a T. "She was pushy," her son said.         A writer since childhood, Mrs. Goodman worked as an itinerant newspaper reporter, radio writer and occasional broadcaster. After reading "Letters from Linda" on a radio program, her son said, she adopted the name Linda.         Mrs. Goodman, whose early marriage to William Snyder ended in divorce, began writing "Sun Signs" in New York after an announcing job that had been promised her second husband, Sam Goodman, fell through.         Although her astrology has been called textbook as opposed to mystical, Mrs. Goodman developed a distinct mystic streak. "Star Signs," for example, draws on both numerology and reincarnation.         And when the New York authorities ruled that her 18-year-old daughter, Sarah Snyder, had committed suicide in 1973, Mrs. Goodman, citing her daughter's astrological chart among other evidence, refused to believe that the body identified by her husband was Sarah's.         She later spent so much time trying to find her daughter that she was forever running out of money, at one point living for several months on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral.         In addition to her son Michael, who is a resident of Keaau, Hawaii, she is survived by another son, William Snyder of Colorado Springs; a daughter, Jill Goodman, of Manchester, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Lillian Nassau, the doyenne of New York antiques dealers and one of the first in America to see a market in Art Nouveau and Art Deco, died early yesterday at her home in New York. She was 95 years old.         Mrs. Nassau held forth in a forest of Tiffany lamps in her two shops, first on Third Avenue and 56th Street and, from 1968 until her retirement in 1982, on East 57th Street. For more than 35 years, her galleries were gathering places for collectors and museum curators from around the world.         They came seeking the 20th-century decorative arts she stocked and the expertise she provided, both on the market and on the history of these objects. She was the first to handle the works of Louis Comfort Tiffany, and became his greatest champion in the revival that began in the mid-1950's and continues today. She paid $176 for her first leaded bronze-and-glass lamp by Tiffany in 1956; before her death Tiffany lamps were selling for more than $1 million.         She was also among the first to stock the works of the giants of early 20th-century European design: Rene Lalique's jewelry and glassware, Georg Jensen's silver, Emile Galle's vases and lamps and the furniture of Josef Hoffmann, Louis Majorelle and Carlo Bugatti.         In the 1970's Mrs. Nassau's clients included Catherine Deneuve, Marcello Mastroianni, Barbra Streisand, Andy Warhol, Warner Leroy, all the Beatles and members of Led Zeppelin and Blood Sweat and Tears. Edgar J. Kaufmann Jr., the architectural historian, started collecting Tiffany flower-form vases there in the 1950's. And David Geffen bought most of his Tiffany lamps there in the 1970's, selling them in 1984 at Christie's in New York for two to five times what he had paid. Sydney and Frances Lewis of Richmond, who were Mrs. Nassau's customers from the 1960's until she retired, donated most of their Tiffany, Art Nouveau and Art Deco objects to the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond..         And after Mrs. Nassau retired, no dealer took her place as the dominant merchant in the field. She remained a recognized authority, often consulted by curators and collectors.         Retirement was difficult for her at first, said her son, Paul, who took over the shop. "She wanted to keep running the business from home," he said. "But she was always available to talk, and until a few years ago, when she became ill, always gave me good advice."         Lillian Brinberg was born in Warsaw. She arrived with her family in New York when she was 2 years old. She attended public schools and went to Columbia University for a few years, hoping to become a newspaper reporter. Instead, she was married in 1920 to Harry Nassau; they were divorced in the late 1930's.         Mrs. Nassau became a dealer in 20th-century decorative arts in 1945, opening the shop on Third Avenue at 56th Street, her first. By then, she had spent a decade in the antiques business, buying and selling gold and jewelry door to door on Long Island, during the Depression. She also worked in a furniture store in Manhattan where she learned about antiques.         She often recalled that as she came into the business, dealers were taking unpopular Tiffany lamps and knocking out the glass flowers and trees, to sell the metal for junk. By the mid-1950's, the revival in Tiffany glass had begun, and Mrs. Nassau was in the vanguard of dealers handling this material.         Among her donations to institutions was a Tiffany mosaic mural that adds a glow to the courtyard of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. She also gave the Metropolitan her favorite piece of jewelry, a glorious enameled necklace, made about 1900 by Lalique.         In addition to her son, she is survived by her husband Dr. Leo S. Palitz and a sister, Pauline Sorkin, all of New York; two grandchildren, and five great-grandsons.       
         Edith Haggard, a New York literary agent whose clients ranged from an important group of proper British writers to the cantankerous Sinclair Lewis, died on Thursday in the Whitney Pavilion of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         In her 30-year career, Mrs. Haggard, who spent five years with the William Morris agency's literary department before joining the Curtis Brown agency in 1937, became one of the city's best-known agents, representing clients like Adela Rogers St. Johns, Nunnally Johnson, Phyllis McGinley, Vera Caspary and Ogden Nash.         A small blond woman whose delicate features were once likened to porcelain,  Mrs. Haggard, whose decidedly fragile appearance belied a will of steel, was also a central figure in the literary social whirl.         Invitations to her annual New Year's Eve parties were coveted, in part because of the number of her famous clients and other acclaimed poets and novelists who would inevitably be present and in part because she was a particularly thoughtful hostess. Mindful that cabs are hard to come by in the wee hours of New Year's Day, she engaged a car and driver for the evening so that her guests could get home.         In addition to a long list of American clients, Mrs. Haggard handled sales to American magazines for several British authors, including C. P. Snow and Daphne  Du Maurier. Her other British authors included Joyce Cary, Richard Llewellyn and Rumer Godden.         In an era when leading magazines had voracious appetites for short fiction, she served almost as an adjunct editor at The Saturday Evening Post, making weekly trips to its headquarters in Philadelphia.         Mrs. Haggard, whose parents, Caroline Briggs and Victor Zorn, were from New Orleans, was born in New York and graduated from Brooklyn Heights Seminary before beginning her literary career, initially at Delineator magazine. There she became associate editor and fell in love with her boss, Sewell Haggard, the  magazine's editor, who died five months after their marriage in 1937.         Mrs. Haggard, who had had a brief teen-age marriage that ended in divorce, was only 34, but she never married again. For the rest of her life she was listed in the Manhattan telephone directory as Mrs. Sewell Haggard.         After her retirement in 1962, she liked to reminisce about her former clients, none of whom, by her account, gave her as much trouble as Sinclair Lewis, a notoriously irascible man, especially when he had been drinking.         She is survived by a niece, Phyllis Lockwood of Anderson, Ind., and two great-nieces, Pamela Herring of Darien, Conn., and Gail Holey of Vienna, Va.

There was some evidence that Mr. Lewis felt remorseful about his abusive treatment of his long-suffering agent. When he died in 1951 he left her a legacy in his will.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Louise Wolff Kahn, a patron of the arts and education in Dallas and elsewhere, died on Monday in the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. She was 85. She had lived in Dallas since 1937, but also kept a home in Manhattan, where she was born.         She graduated from Smith College, then pursued a career in advertising, retailing and interior design in New York before moving to Dallas. There, she worked at Neiman Marcus as the personal secretary to its president, Stanley Marcus, a boyhood friend of her husband-to-be, Edmund J. Kahn, who made a fortune in real estate, cotton and oil.         By the time of Mr. Kahn's death in 1984, the couple had given away $5 million, including $1 million each to their respective colleges, Smith and the University of Pennsylvania, and $1 million for the Dallas Public Library to buy  books. Since her husband's death, Mrs. Kahn had donated more than $15 million to the Dallas Symphony Orchestra, the Dallas Museum of Art, Southern Methodist University and other beneficiaries. Often she gave anonymously.         Having no children or other immediate survivors, Mrs. Kahn left the bulk of her estate, valued at more than $25 million, to the causes close to her heart. They included the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, said her accountant in Dallas, Sallie A. Scanlan.       
         Butterfly McQueen, the actress best remembered for her portrayal of Prissy in "Gone With the Wind," the vexing slave girl who confounded Scarlett O'Hara with  the tearful pronouncement, "I don't know nothin' 'bout birthin' babies, Miss Scarlett," died yesterday. She was 84 years old.         Earlier in the day, Ms. McQueen was critically burned when a kerosene heater  in her one-bedroom cottage just outside Augusta, Ga., caught fire. She suffered  burns over 70 percent of her body and died at Augusta Regional Medical Center.         After appearing in the Civil War epic "Gone With the Wind" in 1939, Ms. McQueen's voice, squeaky and high-pitched, became her most remarked-upon characteristic, prompting one critic to describe it as a "clarinet with a cold"  and another to comment that it was an "itsy-little voice fading over the far horizon of comprehension."         Although Ms. McQueen's role as Prissy earned her fame, it also brought her criticism in later years from people who considered the role stereotypical and demeaning.         "You know, today they call me an Uncle Thomasina," she said in 1970.         But Ms. McQueen, who devoted her later years to serving the African-American  community, said she also felt it necessary to acknowledge the history of black slavery in the United States.         "As I look back on "Gone with the Wind," for instance, I feel it is useful to have this authenticity," she once said. "We've got to know more about where we've come from. I wasn't too happy about the whole thing, but also later in life, as I looked around, I decided to take what I could get and then use it for what I want to do."         Born Thelma McQueen in Tampa, Fla., daughter of a housekeeper and a stevedore, Ms. McQueen first developed a fondness for acting as a child, when she would recite whole books of the Bible at home.         "All I knew as a child was church, church, church," she said.         When her parents separated, Ms. McQueen moved with her mother to Augusta, Ga., and then to New York City. As a teen-ager, she attended high school in Babylon, L.I., and later moved to Harlem.         After a brief stint in nursing school, Ms. McQueen pursued her acting career  in earnest, finding that the stage was much more exciting than a hospital. Her first break came in 1937 when George Abbott offered her a role in "Brown Sugar." The show was a flop, but Ms. McQueen signed on as a permanent member of the Abbott Acting Company.         It was during her years with the acting company that a friend dubbed her "Butterfly," after Ms. McQueen told her she had once danced a butterfly ballet in a performance of "A Midsummer Night's Dream."         Soon after, Mr. Abbott tailored a role for her in "What a Life," which she played on Broadway. One evening, during an intermission in Philadelphia, she received a contract from her agency for Prissy, a role she was initially rejected for after a talent scout called her too chubby. She received the good news with some reservation.         "I'd just come from a modern up-to-date integrated school in 'What a Life' and I couldn't understand why they'd want to bring back the 1800s," Ms. McQueen  said. "Most of my friends were progressive, going forward and looking forward. It was depressing for me."         Despite the success of "Gone With The Wind," Ms. McQueen found it increasingly difficult to find work in film and theater. She appeared in the films "Mildred Pierce" and "The Women," and on several radio shows. In 1951, she put on a one-woman show at Carnegie Hall, but she soon found she had to take on  other jobs to support herself. During the 1950's, she worked as a companion for  a woman in Long Island and sold toys at Macy's. At one time, she began her own radio show in Augusta, "to instill pride in the neighborhood," she said.         In 1966, still unable to find work as an actress, Ms. McQueen wrote a letter  to a Georgia congressman asking him for help in getting a job.         But it was upon her return to Harlem one year later that she found a second vocation -- helping her community. She plunged into antipoverty work and took a  job as a waitress in a soul food restaurant.         Fond of children, she worked at the Mount Morris Park Recreation Center as a  receptionist. Her distinctive voice could be heard through the corridors as she  gave tap dance and ballet lessons. She defined herself at the time through her commitment to the "black family," she said.         Ever restless and determined, Ms. McQueen, who had never completed college, graduated with a degree in political science from City College in 1975 at the age of 64.       
         Louise Wolff Kahn, a patron of the arts and education in Dallas and elsewhere, died on Nov. 27 in the Presbyterian Hospital of Dallas. She was 85. She had lived in Dallas since 1937, but also kept a home in Manhattan, where she was born.         She graduated from Smith College, then pursued a career in advertising, retailing and interior design in New York before moving to Dallas. There, she worked at Neiman Marcus as the personal secretary to its president, Stanley Marcus, a boyhood friend of her husband-to-be, Edmund J.

They included the Museum of Modern Art and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in Manhattan, said her accountant in Dallas, Sallie A. Scanlan.       
         Heida Hermanns, a pianist, teacher and philanthropist, died on Wednesday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 89.         Mrs. Hermanns was born in Wiesbaden, Germany, in 1906. She received her first piano lessons from her mother, Alice Goldschmidt Hermanns, and when she was 15 she enrolled at the Berlin Hochschule fur Musik. Her teachers included Egon Petri, Artur Schnabel, Carl Friedberg and Isabella Vengerova.         She made her debut with the Berlin Philharmonic when she was 18 and toured Europe as a recitalist and concerto soloist through the 1920's and early 1930's. In 1931 she married Artur Holde, a music critic and author. They immigrated to the United States in 1936.         Mrs. Hermanns made her New York debut at Town Hall in 1942, and gave annual recitals that often included works by Busoni, Dussek, Kodaly and other composers whose works were not in the mainstream repertory. Her interest in unusual works  brought her to the attention of the Society for Forgotten Music, with which she  appeared several times.         As a chamber music player, Mrs. Hermanns performed regularly with John Corigliano, the concertmaster of the New York Philharmonic (and the father of the composer of the same name). She also gave duo-piano recitals and made recordings with Ruth Steinkraus Cohen.         In the late 1940's, Mrs. Hermanns and Mr. Holde moved to Westport, where they helped start the Friends of Music, an organization that presented chamber music concerts, there. Mrs. Hermanns was also a founder of Performers of Connecticut, which arranged performance opportunities for young musicians and ran a contest that two years ago was renamed the Heida Hermanns Young Performers Competition.         She was also a supporter of the Levitt Pavilion for the Performing Arts. When the Westport Arts Center was built in the mid-1980's, she underwrote its concert hall, which is called Artur Holde Hall after her husband, who died in 1962.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Pearl Wong, who with her husband, James, operated Pearl's Chinese Restaurant in mid-Manhattan, serving Cantonese fare to the famous and not-so-famous for 18 years until her retirement in 1985, died on Wednesday in her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her sister, Emily Fong, also of Manhattan.         When a restaurant that the Wongs had managed for years, Canton Village, changed hands in the mid-1960's, the couple found themselves without jobs. Almost as distressing, regular customers from the nearby Time-Life Building, who had depended on Mrs. Wong as their culinary guide, faced ordering meals on their own.         The Wongs then began Pearl's Chinese Restaurant, with 52 investors buying single $500 shares, and the Wongs and a handful of other investors buying in at a higher level.         The 68-seat establishment at 149 West 48th Street quickly became a popular haunt for theatrical celebrities. Its loyalty to Cantonese cuisine, while spicier Sichuan-Hunan fare was flourishing, brought in serious diners. Craig Claiborne, the food editor of The New York Times, called it "one of the neatest and best Chinese restaurants in all New York" in 1967.         When the restaurant's quarters were razed for an office tower in 1973, it was moved to its current location at 38 West 48th Street, where the architectural firm of Gwathmey Siegel & Associates gave the interior a cool, sophisticated look.         In 1985, Mrs. Wong joined her husband in retirement. She is survived by her husband and sister.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104.         Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.         "Mother passed away peacefully today," Senator Kennedy said last night. "She had a long and extraordinary life, and we loved her deeply. To all of us in the Kennedy and Fitzgerald families, she was the most beautiful rose of all."         President Clinton extended his condolences last night. "Very few Americans have endured as much personal sacrifice for their country as Rose Kennedy," the President said. "She played an extraordinary role in the life of an extraordinary family. Hillary and I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the Kennedy family."         Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.         In recent years, Mrs. Kennedy, a devout Roman Catholic who often said she drew on her faith to cope with sorrows, had remained out of the public eye that followed her nearly all her life. She spent her time reciting the rosary daily, attending Mass celebrated by a priest in her living room on Sundays and sitting on a porch overlooking Nantucket Sound on sunny weekends while her children and grandchildren paid visits and regaled her with their latest adventures.         They were the twilight years of a life she once described as a series of agonies and ecstasies, a life born into fortune and politics, wed to ambition, graced by the exhilaration of a son in the White House and others on Capitol Hill, but touched by violent death, illness, scandal and other adversities. Tragedy Intrudes On a Privileged Life         Raised in Boston, the daughter of John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor and Massachusetts Congressman, the young Rose Fitzgerald knew a life most only dream of -- private schools, debutante balls, summers on Cape Cod, winters in Palm Beach, trips to Europe and Asia, and hosts of suitors entranced by her young Irish charm and directness.         She was married at 24 to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the son of a saloon keeper, and a dynamo who amassed holdings in banking, real estate, liquor, films and Wall Street that grew to an estimated $500 million. Despite controversy over his wealth and isolationist views, he was posted to the Court of St. James's as Ambassador to Britain from 1938 to 1941.         There were meetings with kings, presidents and popes, and the satisfaction of children on the national stage, in Congress and in the White House. Although hers was a supporting role, her erect bearing, careful grooming and tireless work in her sons' campaigns, made her a figure of public interest in her own right.         She was not a powerful public speaker, but family members called her expert at gauging her audiences. On a single evening, they said, she could don a head scarf and mingle with workmen's wives at a stop in a blue-collar neighborhood, then rush off to campaign at a country club, changing in the back seat of a car into a mink coat and stylish shoes. It was a whirl that led to many successes.         But sorrow intruded time and again. Four of her nine children died in their prime. President Kennedy was slain by an assassin in Dallas in 1963. Senator Robert F. Kennedy was shot by another assassin in Los Angeles during the 1968 Presidential campaign. Her eldest son, Joseph Jr., a Navy pilot, was killed when his plane exploded over the English Channel on a mission in World War II. And a daughter, Kathleen, died in a plane crash in 1948.         Her eldest daughter, Rosemary, was diagnosed as mentally retarded and has lived in a nursing home for 40 years. In 1969, a car driven by Senator Edward Kennedy ran off a bridge on Martha's Vineyard and a young aide, Mary Jo Kopechne, was killed. Later that year, Mrs. Kennedy's husband, who had suffered a stroke in 1961 that left him an invalid, also died.         For Mrs. Kennedy, who had 30 grandchildren and 41 great-grandchildren, the sorrows continued in recent years. A grandson, David, the son of Robert, was found dead in a Florida hotel room in 1985, the victim, officials said, of an apparent overdose of cocaine and Demerol. And Mrs. Kennedy's former daughter-in-law, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, died of cancer last May.         Four years ago, at celebrations marking her 100th birthday, Senator Kennedy, her last surviving son, told 400 family members and friends, "In the chaos of our household, she was the quiet at the center of the storm, the anchor of our family, the safe harbor to which we always came."         There were many books that explored the Kennedys and their conduct, and most touched on Rose Kennedy. "J.F.K.: Reckless Youth," by Nigel Hamilton (Random House, 1992), called the President's mother a chilly, remote woman, obsessed with religion, personal hygiene and designer clothing, and incapable of giving her children the affection they craved.         The assertions prompted a blistering response, published on the Op-Ed page of The New York Times, by four of her children: Senator Kennedy, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, Patricia Kennedy Lawford and Jean Kennedy Smith. "We categorically reject the misjudgments, mischaracterizations, insinuations and outright falsehoods about our family relationships portrayed in the book," they wrote.         "Our parents gave us love, support and encouragement throughout their lives. Contrary to the malicious portrayal in this book, they were devoted and caring parents who lavished affection and attention on all of us."         "The Fitzgeralds and the Kennedys," by Doris Kearns (Simon & Schuster, 1987), also said that Rose and Joseph Kennedy were less than ideal parents, that Mrs. Kennedy eventually became the more remote and even withdrew from her husband into the isolated comfort of her religion, because of "the complicatedly intense relationship she had experienced with her father so many years before."         In her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974), Mrs. Kennedy said that she had devoted herself to her children and that there had been many satisfactions in her role. "What greater aspiration and challenge are there for a mother than the hope of raising a great son or daughter?" she wrote, and called motherhood "a profession that was fully as interesting and challenging as any honorable profession." Early Introduction To Political Life         Rose Fitzgerald was born in Boston on July 22, 1890, the oldest of six children of an exuberant politician and his wife, the former Josephine Mary Hannon. After serving in the Massachusetts Legislature and the United States House of Representatives, her father became Mayor of Boston in 1906.         Her mother was a quiet woman who disliked the limelight, and Rose tasted politics early, parading through the streets with her father and attending public gatherings where the beer and the blarney flowed like the lilt of brogue. He introduced her to Presidents Grover Cleveland and William McKinley, and to his wealthy, influential friends.         She graduated with honors from Dorchester High School at 15, and wanted to enter Wellesley College, but her parents thought she was too young and enrolled her at the Manhattanville College of the Sacred Heart in Purchase, N.Y. She was also sent to Blumenthal Academy, a finishing school run by German nuns, in the Netherlands, where girls majored in French and German.         The Irish were still being snubbed by the Boston Brahmins in those days, and despite her stylish education and attractive, self-assured manner, she was blackballed from the Junior League. She shrugged off the slight and formed her own group, the Ace of Clubs.         There were many suitors, including Sir Thomas Lipton, a tea merchant and yachtsman. But she chose Joseph Kennedy, a political lieutenant of her father. Mr. Fitzgerald did not particularly like Mr. Kennedy. He was too brash and early in the courtship, was made unwelcome in the Fitzgerald house.         But he proposed on the sidewalk outside, and Rose made it clear that she was going to marry him, with or without her father's permission. Mr. Fitzgerald grudgingly blessed the marriage, which took place on Oct. 7, 1914. Soon, Mr. Kennedy gained control of the Columbia Trust Company in Boston and, at 25, became the youngest bank president in the country.         Moving into real estate and liquor interests, he also made fortunes on Wall Street and in Hollywood films. And there were many rumors of infidelity with socialites and movie stars, notably the actress Gloria Swanson.         Meantime, his wife stayed home on Beale Street in Brookline, near Boston, giving birth to and raising her children. Joseph Jr. was born in 1915, followed by John, Rosemary, Kathleen, Eunice, Patricia, Robert, Jean and Edward.         In 1938, Mrs. Kennedy accompanied her husband to the Court of St. James's and was formally welcomed by King George VI. By 1941, the Kennedys were back in the United States.         Mrs. Kennedy took Rosemary, then 22, to several specialists to determine why she had been "slow" since birth. The diagnosis was mental retardation. She was placed in a home in Wisconsin, where she still lives. According to Ms. Kearns's book, she was also given a lobotomy upon orders of her father. Three years later, Mrs. Kennedy's oldest son, Joseph Jr., was killed in the war.         After the war, as John's political career began, Mrs. Kennedy took to the campaign trail with extraordinary zest and considerable effectiveness, speaking at women's functions and shaking hands and chatting at rallies and other functions.         Acquaintances recalled that she was remarkably frank in her conversations with voters and reporters, sometimes even embarrassingly so. Once when there were complaints that large amounts of Kennedy money were being spent on a race, she told a reporter, "It's our money, and we're free to spend it any way we please." An Inauguration Of a Son         The high point of her life, perhaps, was the inauguration of her son John as the 35th President of the United States on Jan. 20, 1961. The gown she wore to his Inaugural Ball was the one she wore when she was introduced to King George VI 20 years earlier.         Her son Robert was appointed Attorney General, and Edward was elected to fill John's unexpired Senate term. Mrs. Kennedy continued to travel widely, appearing with her sons. Her other children were not in the center of public life, although Eunice married Sargent Shriver, who became director of the Peace Corps and the Democratic Vice-Presidential nominee in 1972, Jean was named the Ambassador to Ireland by President Clinton, and Patricia married the actor Peter Lawford, who died in 1984.         Her grandchildren include the son and daughter of President Kennedy, John F. Kennedy Jr., a lawyer, and Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg, who has been active in family interests, including the John F. Kennedy Library in Boston. Another grandchild, William Kennedy Smith, was in the news in 1991 when a Florida woman accused him of rape at the Kennedy estate in Palm Beach; he was later acquitted.         Several of her grandchildren have followed the family tradition of entering politics. Joseph P. Kennedy 2d, Robert's oldest son, became a United States representative from Massachusetts in 1986, replacing the House Speaker, Thomas P. O'Neill, who retired.         Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, Robert's oldest child, was elected Lieutenant Governor of Maryland in 1994; Patrick Kennedy, one of Edward's sons, was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1994 after serving as a Rhode Island state legislator. And Mark Shriver, the son of Eunice, was elected in 1994 to the Maryland House of Delegates.         In 1985, the City of Boston dedicated a one-acre rose garden to Mrs. Kennedy. "I'm one of the most fortunate people in the world," she told an interviewer. "Even though my life has been scarred by tragedy, I have never lost this feeling. God has held us all in his hand."       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy, the mother of President John F. Kennedy and of two United States Senators, the wife of a fabulously wealthy businessman-ambassador and the matriarch of a family whose political triumphs and personal tragedies she carried with quiet dignity for 80 years, died yesterday at the Kennedy family compound in Hyannis Port, Mass. She was 104.         Surrounded by family members at her rambling, white-shingled seaside home on Cape Cod, she died of complications from pneumonia at 5:30 P.M., her son, Senator Edward M. Kennedy of Massachusetts, said. She had been in a wheelchair, partly paralyzed and mostly silent, since 1984, when she suffered the first of a series of debilitating strokes.         Mother passed away peacefully today," Senator Kennedy said last night. "She had a long and extraordinary life, and we loved her deeply. To all of us in the Kennedy and Fitzgerald families, she was the most beautiful rose of all."         President Clinton extended his condolences last night. "Very few Americans have endured as much personal sacrifice for their country as Rose Kennedy," the President said. "She played an extraordinary role in the life of an extraordinary family. Hillary and I extend our deep-felt sympathy to the Kennedy family."         Funeral arrangements were incomplete last night.         In recent years, Mrs. Kennedy, a devout Roman Catholic who often said she drew on her faith to cope with sorrows, had remained out of the public eye that followed her nearly all her life. She spent her time reciting the rosary daily, attending Mass celebrated by a priest in her living room on Sundays and sitting on a porch overlooking Nantucket Sound on sunny weekends while her children and grandchildren paid visits and regaled her with their latest adventures.         They were the twilight years of a life she once described as a series of agonies and ecstasies, a life born into fortune and politics, wed to ambition, graced by the exhilaration of a son in the White House and others on Capitol Hill, but touched by violent death, illness, scandal and other adversities.         Tragedy Intrudes On a Privileged Life         Raised in Boston, the daughter of John (Honey Fitz) Fitzgerald, a Boston mayor and Massachusetts Congressman, the young Rose Fitzgerald knew a life most only dream of -- private schools, debutante balls, summers on Cape Cod, winters in Palm Beach, trips to Europe and Asia, and hosts of suitors entranced by her young Irish charm and directness.         She was married at 24 to Joseph P. Kennedy Sr., the son of a saloon keeper, and a dynamo who amassed holdings in banking, real estate, liquor, films and Wall Street that grew to an estimated $500 million. Despite controversy over his wealth and isolationist views, he was posted to the Court of St. James's as Ambassador to Britain from 1938 to 1941.

God has held us all in his hand."         Correction:  March 17, 1995, Friday         An obituary on Jan. 23 of Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy misstated both the name and the location of the school from which she graduated in 1910. At that time, it was known as the Academy of the Sacred Heart, not Manhattanville College, and it was located in Manhattanville, N.Y., not Purchase. A recent letter from a reader pointed out the error.       
         Rose Fitzgerald Kennedy's church, children and grandchildren today celebrated the enduring Catholic faith of the founding mother of a political dynasty at funeral services in the church where she was baptized 104 years ago.         Her last living son, Edward M. Kennedy, eulogized the mother of a President, two Senators and an Ambassador and the grandmother of two United States Representatives and the Lieutenant Governor and a state representative in Maryland, saying, "She was ambitious not only for our success, but for our souls."         "She sustained us in the saddest times -- by her faith in God, which was the greatest gift she gave us -- and by the strength of her character, which was a combination of the sweetest gentleness and the most tempered steel," he said.         Bernard Cardinal Law, Archbishop of Boston, celebrated the Mass of Resurrection at St. Stephen's Roman Catholic Church and said, "Surely, as she herself expressed it, her greatest gift was the gift of faith."         "She treasured it beyond all others," he continued, "and we honor that gift in her as we bring her here to this church."         The Cardinal read a letter of condolence from President Clinton and an apostolic blessing from Pope John Paul II, and called Mrs. Kennedy "a woman of great strength and deep faith, who is unequaled in the way her life was at the service of the commonweal."         "Few lives," he said, "have been so intertwined with the joys and sorrows of our nation's life as have hers."         Mrs. Kennedy, whose sons John and Robert were assassinated, whose son Joseph P. Kennedy Jr. died in a wartime plane explosion, and whose daughter Kathleen was killed in a plane crash, was quoted by her grandson Edward M. Kennedy Jr. as saying in her autobiography, "Times to Remember" (Doubleday, 1974):         "The most important element in human life is faith. If God were to take away all His blessings, health, physical fitness, wealth, intelligence and leave me with but one gift, I would ask for faith -- for with faith in Him and His Goodness, mercy and love for me, and belief in everlasting life, I believe I could suffer the loss of my other gifts and still be happy."         Along with personal friends of Mrs. Kennedy and her children, the congregation of more than 700 included Tipper Gore, the wife of the Vice President, Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston and Senators John Kerry of Massachusetts, Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island, Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut, Ernest F. Hollings of South Carolina and John D. Rockefeller 4th of West Virginia, all Democrats. The two most prominent Republicans were Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, who has preceded Senator Kennedy in one Senate chairmanship and followed him in another, and Gov. William F. Weld of Massachusetts.         One absentee who was frequently recalled was Mrs. Kennedy's oldest living daughter, Rosemary, who resides in an institution for the mentally retarded in Wisconsin. Eunice Kennedy Shriver, the next oldest, said, "Mother's intelligence was always informed and directed by the strength and compassion of the heart," exemplified when "she never forgot or let us ignore the company of our sister, Rosemary." Mrs. Shriver told of Rosemary's going with her on her first trip to Europe and of their forging a friendship that became the basis of her work for the disabled and the mentally retarded.         The grandmother's determined jaw was recognizable on many of the dozens of descendants who attended. The service was occasionally punctuated by cries from the youngest of her great-grandchildren who were here.         Mrs. Kennedy's 104 years amounted to just more than half the history of the Republic, and Senator Kennedy said she "was born in 1890, the year of the Battle of Wounded Knee, when Benjamin Harrison was in the White House."         "And she never let us forget that she had lived so much of the history that we only read about," he said.         Rose Elizabeth Fitzgerald was baptized in St. Stephen's Church on July 23, 1890, just a day after her birth. She graduated from Dorchester High School and received her diploma in 1906 from her father the Mayor, John F. Fitzgerald, who was known as Honey Fitz. She was courted and wed in 1914 by an ambitious banker, Joseph P. Kennedy.         Both Senator Kennedy and Mrs. Shriver called their mother "our greatest teacher." Mrs. Shriver told of geography quizzes and bedtime stories, and said, "She taught us to listen to Dad's dinner table conversations about politics, which seemed too boring to a small child but later became the basis for our life's work."         This morning Massachusetts drivers stopped in the cold at highway overpasses to watch the motorcade bring her body from her home at Hyannis Port. This afternoon, after the church service, she was buried next to her husband, who died in 1969, in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline.       
         Margaret Kahn Ryan, an heir to a New York financial fortune who carried on her father's interests in opera and art, died yesterday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.         She died of natural causes, her son, John Barry Ryan 3d, said.         Mrs. Ryan, known as Nin, was a daughter of the financier Otto Kahn, a turn-of-the-century multimillionaire who became a benefactor of the Metropolitan Opera even though the Met at first would not assign him a box in its "diamond horseshoe," where rich New Yorkers hobnobbed at intermission.         She joined the Met's board in 1956, and after the company moved to Lincoln Center in the 1960's and announced that it was facing a financial crisis, she worked on an emergency fund drive to raise $3 million. She became an honorary director in 1981.         Mrs. Ryan was also an art collector whose French Impressionist paintings hung on the walls of her triplex apartment on the East Side of Manhattan and, in summers when she went to London, in the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Mrs. Ryan was born on July 4, 1901, at Cedar Court, Kahn's mansion in Morristown, N.J. Kahn's biographer John Kobler wrote that he was closer to her than to his other children. Father and daughter, Mr. Kobler wrote in "Otto the Magnificent" (Scribners, 1989) "golfed together, rode together, swam together, chaffed each other, went to the opera together, and when apart, corresponded frequently." Sometimes their correspondence included long poems. He signed his "Fathie."         When she was in her 20's, she met and married John Barry Ryan, who was working as a reporter for The Newark Ledger. It was a union of financial dynasties: Mr. Ryan was a grandson of Thomas Fortune Ryan, a Virginian who migrated to Wall Street in the 1870's and made millions in railways, tobacco and insurance. He was said to have been the largest single owner of diamond fields in the Belgian Congo.         The wedding took place at Kahn's Fifth Avenue mansion on Feb. 9, 1928. Mrs. Ryan called her husband "Johnny" and her father declared, "It is my deliberate conviction that you are the nicest girl in this here republic."         Kahn added, in a letter mailed after she had been married for a year, at a time when she and Ryan were vacationing in Palm Beach, "I should love to be with you in the pink palazzo by the southern sea, but there is really no sense your being in this relentless city, because during the day the evil spell of the office claims me."         Kahn was a power at the Met until a few years before his death in 1934. Mr. Kober wrote that when Kahn first became involved with the company, the Met had an unwritten rule that no Jew could own a box. He was finally permitted to buy one, in the "diamond horseshoe," 17 years after he had joined the board. The Kahns had Margaret baptized at an Episcopal church in Morristown in 1911, along with her older sister, Maud, and her younger brother, Gilbert.         In 1951, two years after Mrs. Ryan's mother, Addie, died, Mrs. Ryan and the other Kahn heirs sold Rembrandt's "Portrait of a Young Student" for $90,000. They gave the money to the Metropolitan Opera. The Met put up a plaque, first at the old house on Broadway and later at Lincoln Center, that said the money had made possible new productions of Verdi's "Don Carlo" and Mozart's "Cosi Fan Tutte." The "Don Carlo" was Rudolf Bing's first production at the Met.         Among the other productions to which Mrs. Ryan contributed was the 1960 revival of "L'Elisir d'Amore," by Donizetti.         Five years ago, one of her paintings, "The Bench" by Manet, was sold at auction for $16.5 million. Manet's account book showed that the 1881 view of a garden was first sold for 2,000 francs to the Paris dealer Durand-Ruel, who sold it a year later to a Paris stockbroker for 2,500 francs and bought it back 10 years later for 6,000 francs. The painting remained in the dealer's hands until the Ryans bought it in 1945 for an undisclosed sum.         Besides her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Virginia, the Countess of Airlie, who lives in London; eight grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Uta Graf, a German-born soprano and teacher, died on Friday at the Nathaniel Witherill nursing home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 80 and had lived mainly in New York City after coming to the United States in 1948.         She had a long illness, said her daughter, Angele A. Elliott-Smith.         Miss Graf gave recitals at Town Hall in Manhattan in 1949, 1952, 1964 and 1967. After her 1949 appearance, a reviewer wrote, "Being a woman of taste, imagination and musical culture, she won the cordial applause of her audience."         In the first years after her arrival in the United States she also sang with the San Francisco Opera, the New York Philharmonic at Carnegie Hall and the Royal Opera in London. Later she sang in operas, recitals and concerts in the United States, Canada, Europe and South America.         She taught voice at Vassar College in 1949 and later taught at the new England Conservatory of Music in Boston, Manhattan School of Music, Queens College and elsewhere. She also did much private teaching until 1990 and made a score of recordings.         Miss Graf was born in Karlsruhe, Germany, and studied at the Dr. Hoch Conservatory of Music in Frankfurt. She sang in operas and at concerts in Europe early in her career.         Her 1943 marriage to Pierre Bryer, a Belgian violinist, ended in divorce. In addition to her daughter, of Greenwich, Conn., she is survived by a sister, Inge Stegmuller of Princeton, N.J..       
         Berenice Bramson, a soprano who received critical acclaim throughout her career, died on Thursday at her home in Katonah, N.Y. She was 65.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Ms. Bramson was a native of Omaha. She studied at the Juilliard School of Music and Columbia University before making her solo debut at Carnegie Recital Hall in 1953. In a review for The New York Times, Ross Parmenter wrote that Ms. Bramson had provided "an absorbing evening of music" and that she "sang with distinction."         Twenty years later, after another recital, Peter G. Davis wrote in The Times: "Very rarely does an unheralded singer stand comparison with international superstars. Berenice Bramson can match talents with any soprano recitalist before the public today."         Ms. Bramson made her operatic debut in 1976 as Lisa in Tchaikovsky's "Queens of Spades" with the Vancouver Opera Company. She also appeared with the New York Grand Opera and the Brooklyn Opera Company. For more than 40 years, she taught voice at her studio in Katonah and several colleges. She gave her last solo recital in New York at Weill Recital Hall in 1989.         She is survived by her husband, Alan; a daughter, Bobbe Dodge of Ossining, N.Y.; a son, Steven of Los Angeles, and two sisters, Belle Lipsett of Kensington, Calif., and Pearl Jacobson of Davis, Calif.       
         Mary Bingham, the matriarch of the Bingham newspaper empire, died suddenly in Louisville, Ky., on Tuesday evening. She was 90 and lived in Glenview, 15 minutes outside Louisville, on the family estate.         Mrs. Bingham, a philanthropist and civic leader and the widow of Barry Bingham Sr., was delivering a speech at a dinner in her honor when she collapsed. She was pronounced dead of cardiac arrest at Norton Hospital.         At the dinner at the Hyatt Regency hotel to raise money for the de Paul School in Louisville, Mrs. Bingham had been toasted by Gov. Brereton Jones; Jon Jory, artistic director of the Actors Theater of Louisville; other Kentucky dignitaries, and her daughter Eleanor Bingham Miller.         Before delivering her prepared speech, Mrs. Bingham said she was so flattered by the event that "the best thing would be for a big pink cloud to come down and take me away." She then spoke about the need for civic responsibility and asked for support of the Louisville Free Public Library.         In the part of her talk that remained undelivered, she quoted Pericles as saying that an Athenian "who did not acquaint himself with and took no part in public affairs was regarded not as unambitious, but as a man of no consequence whatever."         All her life, she was a most enthusiastic participant in public and cultural affairs. Governor Jones said that with Mrs. Bingham's death, "Kentucky has lost one of its most caring and productive citizens."         A distinguished, articulate woman, Mrs. Bingham was for more than 60 years a major presence on the Louisville scene. Mr. and Mrs. Bingham, always known as "the Binghams," were great hosts, especially at Kentucky Derby time, when their invitations were among the most coveted.         Together with Mr. Bingham, who died in 1988, Mrs. Bingham was a generous supporter of the arts and of educational and social programs. She was a strong environmentalist and also led a drive to send book mobiles to rural Kentucky.         After her husband died, she took over as the head of the family foundation, the Mary and Barry Bingham Sr. Fund, which gave $59 million to a wide variety of institutions. Last fall, the Actors Theater of Louisville opened the Bingham Theater. The beneficence of the Binghams is one reason Louisville is such a prosperous cultural community.         In 1986, a bitter family conflict engulfed the Binghams, leading to the sale of their media empire, the cornerstone of which was The Louisville Courier-Journal, a Pulitzer Prize-winning newspaper known for its liberal politics and socially conscious positions. Barry Bingham Sr. had been publisher of the newspaper after his father, Robert Bingham, and, in turn, he had been succeeded by his son Barry Bingham Jr.         After Barry Bingham Jr. and his sisters, Eleanor and Sallie Bingham, were locked in a feud over control of the company, Barry Bingham Sr. decided to sell. The battle and the sale of the paper to the Gannett chain became front-page news throughout the country. Later, several books were written about the conflict and the family itself, including a memoir by Sallie that was critical of her parents.         Behind the scenes, Mrs. Bingham had been a force at the newspaper. She was a vice president and director and wrote editorials while her husband was overseas during World War II. For 26 years, until 1968, she was the editor of the book review section.         Mrs. Bingham was born Mary Caperton on Dec. 24, 1904, in Richmond, and as a young woman, she acted with Richmond's Little Theater. It was while she was a classics major at Radcliffe College that she met her husband, then a student at Harvard University. They were both involved in collegiate dramatics.         After graduating from Radcliffe in 1928, she spent a year studying in Greece on a fellowship. In 1931, she and Barry Bingham were married. They had five children, including two sons, Worth and Jonathan, who died in accidents.         The Binghams were active in Democratic politics and would, as Mrs. Bingham said, "get together with liberal friends on election night to listen to the results in sympathetic company."         When her son became publisher of the paper, he exchanged houses with his parents, as was the family tradition. The parents moved into the so-called Little House on the family estate, an Italianate villa where Mrs. Bingham continued to live after her husband's death.         In addition to her son and daughters, Mrs. Bingham is survived by six grandsons, four granddaughters and a great-granddaughter.       
         Maggie Kuhn, who called herself a little old woman and celebrated her forced retirement in 1970 by founding the Gray Panthers, died yesterday at the home she shared in Philadelphia with a like-minded coterie. She was 89.         "She died peacefully in her sleep," said her personal assistant, Sue Leary, who could not say which of Miss Kuhn's many ailments, from arthritis to osteoporosis, had caused her death.         For all Miss Kuhn's ailments, none had slowed her down. She spent the last 25 years leading people young and old in the fight against age discrimination and other forms of what she saw as social injustice and stereotypical thinking and just two weeks ago she had joined striking transit workers on their picket line.         Even so, there was some evidence that Miss Kuhn knew that the end was coming. Although she had made it her goal to live until her 90th birthday, in August, she had allowed her friends and admirers to celebrate it on April 1. And in a recent issue of the Gray Panthers' publication, The Network, she had lectured the organization's 40,000 members in 32 states on the need to prepare for the 21st century.         It was hardly the first time Miss Kuhn had been ahead of her time.         It was in 1970 that Miss Kuhn, who had worked 25 years for the United Presbyterian Church in New York, commuting daily from her home in Philadelphia, reached the mandatory retirement age of 65 and was forced to leave her job.         "They gave me a sewing machine," she once recalled, "but I never opened it. I was too busy."         Within months of her retirement, she joined several friends in founding an organization quickly dubbed the Gray Panthers, a name derived from the radical Black Panthers.         Despite the name and the initial emphasis on championing the elderly, as conceived by Miss Kuhn the organization knew no age boundaries. Its credo described it simply as an advocate for "fundamental social change that would eliminate injustice, discrimination and oppression in our present society."         For example, in addition to seeking a ban on mandatory retirement, which was eventually enacted into law, the group called for "publicly owned and democratically controlled" utilities.         No one who knew Miss Kuhn was surprised that in last year's health care debate her organization championed what was widely seen as the most radical of the various proposals: health insurance paid totally by the government, a position that had been on the Gray Panthers' official agenda since 1977.         A tiny woman who wore her hair in a prim bun that gave her the look of an ideal candidate to be helped across the street by a Boy Scout, Miss Kuhn, who detested the term "senior citizen," made no apologies for her looks or her age.         "I'm an old woman," she told The New York Times in 1972. "I have gray hair, many wrinkles and arthritis in both hands. And I celebrate my freedom from bureaucratic restraints that once held me."         Miss Kuhn, whose opposition to the war in Vietnam made her a hero to many young protesters, had a disarming argument in recruiting younger people to her cause: "Everyone of us is growing old."         Known as an inspirational speaker, Miss Kuhn was just as persuasive in private conversation, combining honey with the hammer.         "Forceful, yet gracious" is the way Miss Leary put it yesterday.         Miss Kuhn was a champion of social causes long before the Gray Panthers.         As she noted in her 1991 autobiography, "No Stone Unturned," (Ballantine) she was conceived in Memphis, where her father, a traveling district manage for Dunn & Bradstreet, was working at the time. But her mother, refusing to deliver a child into a racist society, insisted on returning to her home in Buffalo to give birth.         As a student at Flora Stone Mather College of Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Miss Kuhn helped organize a college chapter of the League of Women Voters.         And in a succession of jobs as a manager of social programs for the Young Women's Christian Association in Cleveland, Philadelphia and Boston and in similar work with the Presbyterian Church in New York, Miss Kuhn took what were then unconventional positions on issues like peace and social justice.         Miss Kuhn, who could also be somewhat unconventional in her private life, attributed the fact that she had never married to "sheer luck."         According to her book, she had many love affairs, including one in her 70's with a student in his 20's. Miss Kuhn did not identify him, but Christina Long, who helped her with the book, said the man, now in his 40's, was at the recent birthday gala. "He seemed very proud of the romance," she said.         Miss Kuhn leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Ginger Rogers, the vivacious actress whose supple grace in the arms of Fred Astaire lifted the spirits of Depression-era moviegoers in some of the most elegantly romantic musical films ever made, died yesterday at her home in Rancho Mirage, Calif. She was 83.         The blond, blue-eyed actress, who came out of Charleston contests and the vaudeville circuits to win notice as a cherub-faced flapper with a piping voice and a sassy air in early musicals like "42d Street" and "Gold Diggers of 1933," went on to win acclaim for her dramatic portrayals and an Academy Award for best actress for her depiction of a lovelorn career woman in the 1940 film "Kitty Foyle."         The potent chemistry of her partnership with Astaire, in a succession of urbane romances that featured rapturous dance routines, propelled her into the top 10 of Hollywood's box-office attractions. "He gives her class, and she gives him sex," Katharine Hepburn once said. By 1941, Ginger Rogers was the highest-paid American woman, earning $355,000 a year.         While her graceful dancing was on display in her many musicals, Miss Rogers also won renown in dramatic roles including an aspiring actress in "Stage Door" (1937) and a prostitute's daughter in "Primrose Path" (1940). Her gift for comedy bubbled through movies like "Bachelor Mother" (1939), "Tom, Dick and Harry" (1941) and "The Major and the Minor" (1942). In a screen career that began with a bit role in "Young Man of Manhattan" in 1930, she made more than 70 movies.         But the Astaire-Rogers musicals, epitomizing grace, energy and sophistication, were her enduring memorial. The couple, in their smooth, seemingly effortless style, spun gossamer fantasies from the infectious scores of Irving Berlin, George Gershwin, Jerome Kern, Cole Porter and Vincent Youmans.         Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, said yesterday: "Ginger Rogers was a better dancer than most people gave her credit for. She may have swooped and dipped into many a romantic swoon, but her footwork was as precise as Astaire's."         The plots of their films often turned on mistaken identity and other far-fetched devices, but they were accepted as breathing spaces between the couple's champagne dance numbers in lavish settings where all the walls, telephones and pianos were white, the butlers were always comic and love was the only concern.         Under Astaire's painstaking coaching, Miss Rogers's dancing became more fluid with each film, and the consensus was that none of his later partnerships generated the electricity they did.         Writing in 1972, the dance critic Arlene Croce said Miss Rogers "danced with love, with pride in the beauty of an illusion -- and with one of the most elegant dancer's bodies imaginable." She added, "She avoided any suggestion of toil or inadequacy."         When the actress went to the stage of the Biltmore Bowl in the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles to accept her Oscar on Feb. 27, 1941, she stood with tears streaming down her face and said: "This is the greatest moment of my life. I want to thank the one who has stood by me faithfully: my mother."         It was her mother, the former Lela Owens, who groomed her for a show-business career with singing, dancing and acting lessons. Miss Rogers, whose given name was Virginia Katherine McMath, was born on July 16, 1911, in Independence, Mo. Her father, William McMath, and her mother were divorced soon after. Their daughter was called Ginger because a cousin could not pronounce Virginia, and she took her later surname from John Rogers, who was briefly her stepfather. She grew up in Kansas City, Mo., and Fort Worth. Her mother continued to manage her career until she died in 1977.         At 15, Miss Rogers became the champion Charleston dancer in Texas. Then, for three years, her mother chaperoned her through four vaudeville acts a day throughout the South and Midwest. "I traveled with my mother, Lela, and there was never enough money," Miss Rogers said. "I always had to roll down my silk stockings and carry a doll when we bought train tickets so I could go half-fare. If we had $3, we always figured how to tip for the trunks and still eat." She played Kansas City, St. Louis and Chicago. When Miss Rogers was 18, they went to New York, where she sang with two bands and in a musical and starred in the Gershwins' 1930 Broadway hit "Girl Crazy," introducing the songs "But Not for Me" and "Embraceable You."         At 19, she made her first feature film in New York, "Young Man of Manhattan," uttering a memorable instruction: "Cigarette me, big boy." In her third musical film, "42d Street," she was a risque, wisecracking chorine, Anytime Annie. "The only time she said no," a fellow actor quipped, "she didn't hear the question."         Her big break came when she was 22, when she and Mr. Astaire won supporting roles in "Flying Down to Rio." Their rollicking introduction of a dance called the Carioca stole the show from its nominal stars, Dolores Del Rio and Gene Raymond.         Over the next six years they were teamed in eight more movies and introduced a glittering array of now-standard songs and dances, among them "Night and Day" and "The Continental" from "The Gay Divorcee," "I Won't Dance" from "Roberta," "Cheek to Cheek" from "Top Hat," "Let's Face the Music and Dance" from "Follow the Fleet," "Never Gonna Dance" from "Swing Time" and "They All Laughed" from "Shall We Dance."         Years later, she wrote about their partnership, emphasizing that Astaire was no Svengali. By the time they joined forces in "Flying Down to Rio" in 1933, she pointed out, she had made 20 films, he only one. She acknowledged that they had "occasional snits," but, she said: "We had fun, and it shows. True, we were never bosom buddies off the screen; we were different people with different interests. We were a couple only on film."         And, she noted: "I'd do three or four pictures between those I made with Fred. We weren't Siamese twins. I always wanted to stretch out and do some things as me, alone, by myself. I did, and among the things was 'Kitty Foyle.' "         Miss Rogers's later films included an elaborate fantasy, "Lady in the Dark" (1944); a wartime romance, "I'll Be Seeing You" (1945); the comedies "Dreamboat" (1952), "Monkey Business" (1952) and "Forever Female" (1954), and melodramas like "Tight Spot" (1955) and "Harlow" (1965). Reviewers attributed her enduring success to a dualistic personality -- tough versus vulnerable, ingenuous versus calculating -- and to a talent for mimicry and pretense.         In 1951, Miss Rogers won wide praise in a Broadway comedy, "Love and Let Love," although reviewers panned the play. Typically, she concluded, "We could have gone on touring around the country, probably playing to packed houses and getting our money back, but I'd rather be a sitting duck in a big pond."         In later musical triumphs, she succeeded Carol Channing in the title role of "Hello, Dolly!" on Broadway in 1965 and played the role to ovations for more than two years. In 1969, she introduced "Mame" to London audiences. Gower Champion, who directed her in "Dolly," hailed her "drive, verve, spark and talent."         Miss Rogers liked to keep busy. She often worked in summer stock, appearing in productions of musicals like "Annie Get Your Gun" and "The Unsinkable Molly Brown" and in comedies like "Tovarich" and "Bell, Book and Candle." In the 1970's she developed a successful nightclub act, and she was also a fashion consultant to the J. C. Penney chain.         In her last film, in 1965, she played Jean Harlow's mother in "Harlow." By then, she was unhappy with the frankness of Hollywood films. Looking back, she said, "We made happy pictures that people enjoyed seeing, not the kind the audiences have to go through trauma to see nowadays."         Miss Rogers's autobiography, "Ginger: My Story," was published by HarperCollins in 1991. John Mueller, in The New York Times Book Review, found Miss Rogers's book short on insight and discreet to the point that "one does not get a terribly rich feel for her personality." In discussing her career, he continued, "she is far more likely to tell us what she wore than what she did."         Miss Rogers was a Christian Scientist who never smoked or drank alcohol, except for an occasional glass of wine at supper. She loved the outdoors and exercised regularly. When her schedule allowed, she swam every day and played golf and tennis several times a week. She ate moderately and maintained a trim figure in middle age, giving this advice: "I try to feed my hunger rather than my appetite."         In 1938, she built a mountaintop mansion in Beverly Hills with a large swimming pool, a tennis court and an elaborate soda fountain. She also bought a big dairy and multi-crop ranch on the Rogue River near Medford, Ore., which eventually became her main home.         The actress was married five times: to Edward Culpepper, a dancer and actor known in vaudeville as Jack Pepper (1928 to 1931); the actor Lew Ayres (1934 to 1940); Jack Briggs, another actor (1943 to 1949); Jacques Bergerac, a French actor and businessman (1953 to 1957), and William Marshall, a director and producer (1961-1967). All five marriages ended in divorce. "I yearned for a long, happy marriage with one person," she wrote. But, she said, her life had been blessed in other ways, and in 1987 she said she didn't mind being alone. "It'd be fun to have a chum around, but it's very had to have a chum unless you're married to him," she said. "And I don't believe in today's concept for living with someone unmarried."         In 1992, Miss Rogers was one of the recipients of the 15th annual Kennedy Center Honors for lifetime achievement.         Asked by one interviewer what personal quality she was proudest of, Miss Rogers replied: "The most important thing in anyone's life is to be giving something. The quality I can give is fun and joy and happiness. This is my gift." Ever a Trouper Through the Decades         In more than six decades in show business, Ginger Rogers appeared in some 70 films, as well as in vaudeville, theater and television.

         Annie Fischer, a Hungarian pianist known for the elegance of her Mozart performances and her vital, prismatic approach to early Romantic repertory, died on Monday at her home in Budapest. She was 81.         Miss Fischer was a pianist who played with an intensity of concentration and focus that seemed almost at odds with the poetry and impetuousness of her interpretive style. She shunned the machinery of modern career-making and rarely gave interviews. Preferring not to be far from Budapest, she performed mostly in Europe, although she undertook several brief tours of the United States over the last 13 years. And because she disliked making recordings, the comparatively few disks she recorded for Deutsche Grammophon and EMI are prized by collectors.         Miss Fischer was born in Budapest on July 5, 1914, and studied with Anton Szekely and Ernst von Dohnanyi at the Franz Liszt Academy. She made her public performing debut in Budapest when she was 8, and she toured as a concerto soloist when she was 12.         Her mature career began in 1933 when she toured Europe as the winner of the first prize in the Franz Liszt International Piano Competition. In 1935 she married the musicologist and conductor Aladar Toth, who died in 1971. In 1941 they left Hungary for Sweden, and Miss Fischer suspended her performing career during World War II. She began touring Europe again in 1946, after she and her husband returned to Budapest. But she did not make her United States debut until 1961, when she played the Mozart Concerto in E flat (K. 482) with George Szell and the Cleveland Orchestra at Carnegie Hall.         Her American performances thereafter were sporadic, and she made her belated Carnegie Hall recital debut in 1982. In recent seasons, she gave recitals every two or three years at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Early in her career, Miss Fischer developed a large repertory that ranged from Bach to Bartok, but from the start her Mozart, Beethoven, Schubert and Schumann performances were singled out for particular praise. Critics often noted that her appeal was in her interpretations rather than in her technique. She could expand rhythms beyond their natural boundaries, and particularly in her later years, complete accuracy in dense passages sometimes eluded her. Yet the impression one carried away from her performances was of an insightful and intensely musical player.         Miss Fischer was awarded the Kossuth Prize by the Hungarian Government three times.         She is survived by a sister, Magda Fischer of Budapest, and a stepson.
