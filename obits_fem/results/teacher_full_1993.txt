         Adele Bowers, a short-story writer and publisher, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78 years old.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Richard Bowers.         The couple also had a country home in upstate New York at Delhi.         One of her most popular short stories, "The Hunting Season," reflected her devotion to animals and opposition to hunting, and it was included in several collections. One, "A Wider Giving: Women Writing After a Long Silence," was published in 1988 by Chicory Blue Press.         She was the president of the book division of Times Mirror Magazine. She helped create and then ran two of the country's most successful book clubs devoted to specialized interests, Outdoor Life and Popular Science. She also helped establish two other book clubs dealing with nature and crafts. After retiring from publishing in 1979, she was a literary agent and devoted herself to writing.         She graduated from Hunter College and taught English in New York City. In recent years, she was a volunteer teacher at Public School 3 in Greenwich Village.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter by a previous marriage, Karen Bercovici of Montpelier, Vt.; a granddaughter, Toby Bercovici, and two stepchildren, Pamela Tengdin of Cranston, R.I., and Roger Bowers of Charlottesville, Va.       
         Lacey Fosburgh, a writer whose books chronicled murder, family passions and mystery in India, died last night at California Pacific Hospital in San Francisco. She was 50 years old and lived in Mill Valley, Calif.         Ms. Fosburgh, who began her writing career as a reporter for The New York Times, died of complications of breast cancer, said a friend of the family.         Ms. Fosburgh's books were the nonfiction "Closing Time" (1977) and the novels "Old Money" (1983), about a woman photographer's painful relationship with her father, and "India Gate" (1991), a sprawling, passionate novel set in India. At her death, she was writing a novel set in present-day New York City under contract to Simon & Schuster.         She was a staff reporter for the Times from 1968 to late 1973. In the last 20 years, she also wrote freelance newspaper and magazine articles, many of them for The Times, taught journalism at the University of California at Berkeley and was a consultant to newspapers, among them The Oakland Tribune.  Murder and Mysteries         A 1973 murder case about which Ms. Fosburgh wrote for The Times became the subject of "Closing Time," which was a selection of the Literary Guild and the Doubleday Book Club. It won a Mystery Writers of America award.         The murder victim was a troubled teacher, Roseann Quinn. The police said she took an Indiana drifter, John Wayne Wilson, home to her apartment on West 72d Street in Manhattan from a nearby singles bar. They said her body had been sexually mutilated. After being held five months on murder charges, Mr. Wilson hanged himself in his jail cell.         In "Contemporary Authors," a series of reference books, Truman Capote is quoted as remarking that the book showed that Ms. Fosburgh "is a skillful, selective reporter and also a literary artist."         Ms. Fosburgh was born in Manhattan, the daughter of Hugh Whitney Fosburgh, a journalist and author who died in 1976, and Helen Edwards Fosburgh. Through her paternal grandmother, Leila Whitney Fosburgh, Ms. Fosburgh was descended from the Whitney family. She graduated from the Brearley School in Manhattan and Sarah Lawrence College. She was a debutante at a dinner-dance at the St. Regis Hotel. From 1964 to 1966 she studied in New Delhi on a Fulbright grant.         Her 1973 marriage to Marc Libarle ended in divorce in 1975.         She is survived by her second husband, David Harris, a writer who was a prominent opponent of the Vietnam War, whom she wed in 1977; a daughter from her second marriage, Sophie Whitney Harris of Mill Valley; her mother, who lives in Manhattan, and a brother, Pieter, of Manhattan.

         Annapaola Cancogni, a teacher, writer and translator of French and Italian works into English, died on Wednesday at Mt. Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 48 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of cancer, said Anne F. Garetta, her companion.         Dr. Cancogni taught at Harvard and at Queens College in New York and in the Paris program of the University of California at Berkeley.         Her translations included Umberto Eco's "Open Work and Other Essays" (1989), Annie Cohen-Solal's "Sartre" (1987), Raymond Radiguet's "Count d'Orgel's Ball" (1989), Francesca Duranti's "Happy Ending" (1990) and Annette Kahn's "Why My Father Died: The Trial of Klaus Barbie" (1991).         She wrote culture and travel articles for Italian newspapers and magazines and book reviews for The New York Times and The Chicago Tribune.         Dr. Cancogni was born in Florence, Italy, and grew up in Tuscany, France and England. She earned a bachelor's degree at the University of Wisconsin and a doctorate in comparative literature from Harvard in 1979.         In addition to her companion, she is survived by a son, Lance R. Mankowski of Brooklyn; her parents, Manlio and Maria Vittoria of Pietrasanta, Italy, and a sister, Alessandra Cappuccio of Florence.       
         Elizabeth Wood, a public housing pioneer who advocated racial and economic integration and the designing of workable neighborhoods, died yesterday at a nursing home near Atlanta. She was 93.         She suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a broken hip and a stroke, said Gisela Titman, a niece.         Miss Wood was the founding director of the Chicago Housing Authority, an Illinois state housing official and an officer of the National Association of Housing Officials. She was later a housing consultant in New York City and an administrator at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.         Known as "Chicago's largest landlord," she headed the authority from 1937 to 1954, supervising the building and management of homes for thousands of families. Sought Real Neighborhoods         The philosophy she developed over the years was to mix residents by race, economic class and family size. She proposed that social workers help troubled families who might drag down a project.         Miss Wood favored small, dispersed projects rather than high-rise concentrations. A building's height should be limited to the distance that a mother in a window could be heard when calling to a child in a playground below, she said.         She urged planners to include shops, churches, parks and even pubs to turn housing complexes into real neighborhoods instead of human warehouses. Courtyards and indoor gathering places should have an inviting "design for loitering," she said. She sponsored flower-growing contests to brighten the projects.         Political pressure eventually forced Miss Wood out of her Chicago job. She said she fought with officials "and anybody else who stood in the way of getting homes built for the people."         She then went to New York, where she did studies for the City Housing Authority and the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. From 1965 to 1972 she worked at H.U.D. in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations to coordinate housing policy with other social and poverty programs.         She won Guggenheim and Ford Foundation grants to study in Iran and analyze housing in India. She wrote numerous articles and books.         The daughter of a missionary teacher, Miss Wood was born in Nara, Japan, and grew up in Bloomington, Ill. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in rhetoric at the University of Michigan, she taught English for four years at Vassar College.         After moving to Chicago for doctoral studies, she instead became a social worker for United Charities. She then joined the Home Modernization Bureau, where a major contractor tutored her on the construction industry.         When the New Deal Public Works Administration began building housing, she became a planner. She also served as executive secretary of the Illinois Housing Board when it drafted a law creating housing authorities.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Sally A. Provence, professor emeritus in the Child Study Center and the Pediatrics Department at Yale University, died on Saturday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford, Conn. She was 76 and lived at Branford.         The cause was cancer, said Dr. Albert J. Solnit, a longtime colleague.         For 35 years, Dr. Provence was director of the center's Child Development Unit. She retired in 1986. A pioneer in child development, both as a teacher and researcher, she documented young children's suffering and recovery from deprivation and trauma.         A founder and past president of the National Center for Clinical Infant Programs, she received many honors, including the C. Anderson Aldrich Award of the American Academy of Pediatrics.         Born in Wills Point, Tex., she graduated from the Baylor University College of Medicine. Among her many publications, she is best known for her book "Working with Disadvantaged Parents and Their Children" (Yale University Press, 1983).         She is survived by her companion and co-worker, Audrey Naylor of Branford, and a sister, Ada Belle Banta of Wills Point.       
         Masha Tumarkin, who helped institute a new technique for teaching English to upwards of 50,000 recent immigrants in New York City, died on Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 49 and was a Manhattan resident.         The cause of death was leukemia, her family said.         For several years she was the director of the English program for the New York Association for New Americans, a nonprofit organization in Manhattan that aids in resettlement. She employed a system by which students start speaking in English within 12 weeks, when conventional methods often take many months longer. She supervised development of texts and curriculum and teacher retraining.         The concept, developed by her predecessor, Ira Goetz, features a fast-paced, question-and-answer format in which the teacher moves about the classroom from one student to another.         Born in Manhattan to Russian immigrants, Ms. Tumarkin grew up in a bilingual home with relatives and neighbors speaking in accents. After graduating from Columbia, she earned a master's at New York University in teaching English as a second language. She taught English at City College before joining the association in 1980.         Her marriage to Ethan Gologor ended in a divorce that drew publicity for a custody accord in which the children shuttled between the mother's and father's homes on alternating days.         Her survivors include her husband of a year, Richard Girard; two sons, Matthew Gologor of Oberlin, Ohio, and Benjamin Gologor of Manhattan; her mother, Suzanne Tumarkin of Manhattan, and a sister, Nina Tumarkin of Cambridge, Mass.       
         Irene Claire Fromer, a retired teacher and artist, died on Tuesday at Doctors Hospital on Staten Island. She was 70 and lived on Staten Island and in St. Croix, V.I.         Her death was a result of a myocardial flu virus, said her husband of nearly 50 years, Dr. Stephen Fromer.         Mrs. Fromer, a graduate of Hunter College, earned a master's degree at Columbia University with a thesis on Herman Melville and the industrial revolution. She taught in the public schools and at one time worked for Merck & Company, writing abstracts on new drugs.         She was an expert in Haitian art and had some of her own work -- paintings, collages and sculptures -- shown at several exhibitions. Together with her husband, she worked at Medical Consultants V.I. in St. Croix, advising doctors on office management.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Fromer is survived by a son, Dr. Carl H., of Staten Island; a daughter, Dr. Sandra A. Stingle of Manhattan; her mother, Bella Siegel of Staten Island; a brother, Jack Siegel of New Rochelle, N.Y., and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Alice Ettinger, who helped to bring new X-ray techniques to diagnose gastrointestinal illness to the United States and taught radiology for five decades at the Tufts University School of Medicine, died on April 14 at the Norwood Retirement and Nursing Home in Norwood, Mass. She was 93 years old.         The cause of death was pneumonia, said her nephew, Michael Roemer.         Dr. Ettinger was a highly regarded teacher who developed the first radiology residency program at Tufts and practiced at the New England Medical Center in Boston for nearly 40 years.         Alice Ettinger was born in Berlin on Oct. 8, 1899, four years after Wilhelm Konrad Roentgen discovered the X-ray. She received her medical degree from the Albert Ludwig University in Freiburg, Germany, in 1924 and went on to a residency at the Charite Hospital of Friedrich Wilhelm University in Berlin. She received intensive training in radiology from Dr. Hans Heinrich Berg, a pioneer in X-rays of the stomach and intestines. A 1932 Trip Is Crucial         At the time, radiologists had a device, the fluoroscope, that used X-rays to cast an image of the bowel on a screen. But it did not leave a permanent record, and Dr. Berg designed and built a machine, the spot-film device, that captured the fluoroscopic image on film so it could be studied later.         When Tufts asked Dr. Berg for the new device, he sent Dr. Ettinger off in 1932 with the machine in her luggage. Her arrival helped to launch modern gastrointestinal radiology in this country.         She joined the faculty at Tufts that year and remained for the rest of her career. She became clinical professor of radiology in 1950 and was chairwoman of the radiology department from 1959 to 1965, when she became professor emeritus. In 1939 she was made roentgenologist-in-chief at the Boston Dispensary and the New England Medical Center Hospital, and in 1965 she became senior radiologist at the medical center.         She continued as a clinician and teacher at Tufts until 1970, when at age 71 she became a consultant and director of student teaching, overseeing the radiology teaching program at the medical school until 1985 and teaching an elective course. For at least 13 consecutive years, she received the faculty teaching award from the graduating class at Tufts.         Dr. Ettinger's efforts also led to one of the earliest formal training programs for X-ray technologists, at Northeastern University. Among the awards she received was the Gold Medal of the American College of Radiology.         In addition to Mr. Roemer, of Yonkers, she is survived by a niece, Marianne Shoopak of Sunnyvale, Calif.       
         Eugenie Leontovich, an actress, playwright, director and teacher who created memorable roles on Broadway in "Grand Hotel," "Twentieth Century" and "Anastasia," died yesterday at the Kateri Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 93.         The cause was cardiac arrest and pneumonia, said Dr. Joseph Klager, a doctor at the nursing home.         Miss Leontovich was born in Moscow on March 21, 1900. Before the Revolution, she was a member of the Moscow Art Theater and studied under several legendary teachers, including Meyerhold. Her father, a military officer, fought with the White Army, as did her three brothers, who were subsequently captured, tortured and killed by the Bolsheviks.  A Hecht-MacArthur Star         A passionate anti-Communist, Miss Leontovich made her way to Paris after the Revolution and, in 1922, to the United States. She won favorable notices in 1930 on Broadway as Grusinskaya, the dancer, in "Grand Hotel." "She has the dignity, the pleading sincerity of an artist -- all nerves and pride," wrote Brooks Atkinson in The New York Times.         In 1932 she played Lilly Garland in Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur's comedy "Twentieth Century." Her first appearance on the London stage was in 1935, as the Archduchess in "Tovarich," opposite Sir Cedric Hardwicke.         With Elena Miramova she wrote "Dark Eyes," about three female Russian refugees trying to survive in New York. Produced by Jed Harris, the play opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for 230 performances.         Miss Leontovich also created the role of the Dowager Empress in the 1954 Broadway production of "Anastasia," which starred Viveca Lindfors. She played the Queen in William Saroyan's "Cave Dwellers" in 1957, and Mme. Kuprin in "A Call on Kuprin" in 1961. In 1972, she did her own adaptation of Tolstoy's "Anna Karenina" Off Broadway; she titled it "Anna K." and both directed and starred in it.         Miss Leontovich, whose students addressed her and referred to her as "Madame," lived in a Manhattan apartment surrounded by family pictures and icons. Lithe, with an erect carriage that made her look taller than her 5 feet, she spoke in heavily accented English and favored dramatic speech. When asked about her traditional outfit of black trousers, black sweater and black scarf, she would respond, "I'm in mourning for my life." The line was from Chekhov's "Sea Gull."  Two Marriages         Miss Leontovich's two marriages ended in divorce. According to her official biography, her first husband, Paul A. Sokolov, was a member of the Russian nobility. Her second husband was the actor, producer and director Gregory Ratoff. "We met in Moscow, we were married in 1923, and that was the last of my legal marriages," she said of Mr. Ratoff in an interview in 1972. "He left me for a Georgian woman from Russia. She was beautiful. He left me our house in California, half of his money, and they went off to Italy."         Miss Leontovich also acted in films and television. Her best-known movie is perhaps "The Rains of Ranchipur," a 1955 remake of "The Rains Came" (1939), with Richard Burton and Lana Turner.         For seven years in the 1960's Miss Leontovich was an artist in residence at the Goodman Theater in Chicago. She also taught acting in California and New York.       
         Beatrice Bishop Berle, a physician, teacher and author, died on Friday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass.  She was 90 years old.         Her death was caused by complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Beatrice Berle Meyerson.         Dr. Berle, who ran a neighbhorhood health clinic in East Harlem from 1953 until 1962, took a pioneering approach to family medicine by treating the entire family for the effects of heroin abuse by a member. She also helped to establish methadone maintenance as a significant treatment for heroin abuse.         Dr. Berle, who was born on Aug. 6, 1902, in Lenox, Mass, graduated from Vassar College in 1923. She received a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1924 and a medical degree from New York University in 1938.         In 1927 she married Adolf A. Berle Jr., an economist and lawyer who served during the Roosevelt Administration as Assistant Secretary of State. Dr. Berle worked in the United States Public Health Service in Washington from 1943 until 1944. Worked in Brazil         Traveling to Brazil with her husband, who was Ambassador to Brazil from 1945 until 1946, Dr. Berle volunteered in hospital wards in Rio de Janeiro, where she organized efforts to expand the practice of preventive medicine. She also wrote articles and edited a book on medical problems in Brazil.         Her other books were "Eighty Puerto Rican Families in New York City," a study of the families in her East Harlem clinic, published by Columbia University Press in 1958, and "A Life in Two Worlds," an autobiography published in in 1983 by Walker & Company.         During her career, Dr. Berle was associated with St. Luke's Hospital Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at the Bronx State Hospital, Cornell University Medical College, New York University Medical College and Yeshiva University.         After the death of her first husband in 1971, Dr. Berle in 1975 married Dr. Andre F. Cournand, a physican who was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1956. Dr. Cournand died in 1988.         In addition to Ms. Meyerson, of Washington, Dr. Berle is survived by another daughter, Alice Berle Crawford of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, Peter A. A. Berle of Manhattan; 10 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Arleen Auger, an American soprano who was renowned for both her commanding presence on the opera stage and the subtlety of her song interpretations, died on Thursday at the home of a friend in Leusden, a suberb of Amsterdam, in the Netherlands. She was 53 and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Mary Lou Falcone, Miss Auger's publicity agent, said the cause was brain cancer.         Miss Auger's most famous performance was her appearance at the wedding of Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson, the Duke and Duchess of York, on July 23, 1986. She sang Mozart's "Exsultate, Jubilate" as part of the ceremony at Westminster Abbey, which was televised globally and seen by some 500 million people.  Debut in Vienna         Mozart was always at the core of her repertory. Miss Auger (pronounced awe-ZHAY) had exactly the right flexibility, coloring and vocal weight for Mozart opera roles and concert works, and they were the vehicles with which she had her biggest successes. She made her operatic debut as the Queen of the Night in a 1967 Vienna State Opera production of "Die Zauberflote." Nine years later she made her New York debut in the same role at the New York City Opera. Among her recent recordings are highly praised portrayals of Donna Anna in "Don Giovanni" and the Countess in "Le Nozze di Figaro."         She also won great acclaim for her performances of Bach, Handel and Haydn, and although she did not eschew the use of vibrato, as other early-music singers did, she was considered a supremely stylish interpreter of that repertory. Still, she resolutely resisted being typecast. She constantly expanded her repertory, and applied her rich tone and her thoughtful sense of line to everything from Schubert and Schumann lieder and turn-of-the-century French art songs to works by Weill, Berg and Schoenberg. Libby Larsen and Judith Zaimont were among the composers from whom she commissioned new song cycles.         "I sing Bach, Mozart, contemporary music and everything in between," she wrote in an article for Keynote in 1985. "If it's for my voice and my voice can do it well, I'm happy to do it."         But Miss Auger was a late bloomer, musically: she did not begin studying voice until she was out of college and working as an elementary-school teacher in Chicago. And when she auditioned for the Vienna State Opera, she knew only one role, the Queen of the Night.  Taught Elementary Schoolers         Arleen Auger was born in South Gate, Calif., on Sept. 13, 1939. She studied the piano and violin briefly as a child and sang in community choirs, but she later told interviewers that she had had very little exposure to classical music when she was growing up. She attended California State University at Long Beach, where she earned a degree in education in 1963. For the next four years, she taught elementary school in Chicago, Denver and Los Angeles.         The world of opera and art song opened for her in 1965, when she was teaching in Chicago and began studying voice with Ralph Errolle. She apparently progressed quickly; two years later, when she was teaching first grade in Los Angeles, she won first prize in the I. Victor Fuchs Competition. The prize included a trip to Vienna to audition for the Volksoper. Her audition repertory included three pieces: the two Queen of the Night arias and Olympia's aria from Offenbach's "Tales of Hoffmann."         As it turned out, the soprano Lucia Popp had just withdrawn from a production of "Zauberflote" at the Vienna State Opera. That company's director, Josef Krips, heard Miss Auger's audition at the smaller Volksoper, and offered her a contract. When she joined the company, she later said, she knew only the one role, had no stage experience and did not speak German. She made her debut without a rehearsal, and had to ask other singers where to go as she was pushed out on stage.  Sought Expanded Repertory         But she prospered in Vienna. During her first two years she added a dozen roles to her repertory, and she remained with the company until 1974, when she began to find the State Opera's repertory expectations too constricting. When she left the company she began singing more frequently at other European houses, including La Scala. She also expanded her recital repertory and took a teaching position at the Academy of Music and Drama in Frankfurt, where she taught until 1987.         She had by then become intent on regulating the pace of her career. She refused to sing roles if she did not consider herself ready for them, sometimes alienating conductors whose invitations she declined. But she said later that those decisions saved her voice and prolonged her career.         By the early 1980's, Miss Auger's European career was thriving, though her concert and opera appearances in the United States had been relatively few. She had cemented her reputation as an early-music singer at the Oregon Bach Festival, directed by Helmuth Rilling (with whom she recorded more than 50 Bach cantatas) and at the New England Bach Festival. But at the time, American listeners knew her mostly through what was already a vast discography.         Miss Auger began to cultivate an American following seriously in January 1984, when she sang Mozart, Schubert, Debussy and Strauss songs at her New York debut recital at Alice Tully Hall. Reviewing that concert in The New York Times, Donal Henahan praised the clarity of her tone and her sensitivity to musical and textual nuances. "Although pure lyricism is obviously Miss Auger's strong point, there is more to her than that," he wrote, adding that she "is a singing actress of some depth." Explored the Nuances         Thereafter, Miss Auger performed more frequently in the United States, and her recitals were high points of the concert season for fans of art song. Statuesque and attractive, she was a compelling and elegant stage personality who invariably gave the impression of having thoroughly explored both the overt emotional resonance and the underlying psychological nuances of the songs on her programs. She continued performing until last season, when her illness forced her to cancel touring plans and recording projects.         Miss Auger made nearly 200 recordings, documenting a vast repertory that ranged from her Bach, Mozart and Handel specialties to a series of both standard and offbeat opera and song projects. Many of her recordings won international awards, including the Grand Prix du Disque, the Edison Prize and the Deutscher Schallplattenpreis.         She is survived by her parents, Everett and Doris Auger, and a brother, Ralph Auger of Healdsburg, Calif. SELECTED RECORDINGS         Arleen Auger's recordings document her talents as opera singer, recitalist and soloist in oratorios and symphonic choral works.

         Sara K. Dadourian, superintendent of an Armenian day school, died at her home in Manhasset, L.I., on Saturday. She was 65 and also kept a home in Fort Lauderdale, Fla.         The cause was cancer, family sources said.         Mrs. Dadourian joined the staff of the Holy Martyrs Armenian Day School in Bayside, Queens in 1974, serving as teacher, principal, then superintendent. She was also a benefactor of the Armenian Seminary of New York and a member of the Armenian Assembly, a national lobbying organization.         Born in New York, she attended Brooklyn College. After the death of her first husband, Ralph Anoushian, she received her master's degree in Education from Queens College in 1978.         Her second marriage to Dadour Dadourian ended with his death in 1991.         Survivors include a daughter, Suzanne Froundjian of Manhasset; two sons, Karl of Bellerose Village, L.I. and Walter Anoushian of Manhasset; her mother, Shoushan Kaprielian; a brother Walter Kaprielian, both of Bellerose Village, and four grandchildren.       
         Florence Turitz Bower, a music teacher for more than 60 years, who headed the voice department at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Manhattan, died on Wednesday at home in Newton, Mass. She was 94 and had moved to Newton from New York City recently.         The cause was heart failure, said her son, Joseph, a professor in the Harvard School of Business Administration.         Mrs. Bower joined the faculty of the academy as a voice teacher in 1964, the year it was founded. She soon became chairwoman of the voice department, a position she held until retiring in 1991. Her students ranged from classical recitalists and opera singers to musical theater performers.         Before her work at the Academy, she was a member of the faculty of the Henry Street Settlement House and at the Dalcroze School of Music and taught many private pupils.         She began studying music at an early age and graduated in 1919 from the Institute of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.         For the next eight years, she pursued music studies in Paris, Berlin and Florence, where her teachers included Egon Petri, Yvette Guilbert and Bertha Fiering Tapper. When osteoarthritis prevented a career as a pianist, she became an apprentice to a throat surgeon in Paris to study the mechanism of the singing voice.         Besides her son, Joseph L., survivors include a daughter, Ellen Feingold of Newton; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Cooper, a Manhattan community organizer of child-care and women's-support services, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Washington Heights.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cooper, who remained active until her death, was the membership chairwoman of the Upper West Manhattan branch of the League of Women Voters. She served on the boards of Fort George Head Start and the Napeague Institute of Art in Amagansett, L.I.         She played a key role in Womanspace, a program devoted to women's support services at Columbia University. An amateur painter, she served as administrator of the art school at the Museum at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1970's and held private art classes for children.         Born in Brooklyn, she graduated from Adelphi College and earned a master's degree in comparative literature at Columbia University.         Mrs. Cooper's husband, Rudolf, a high school teacher, died in 1968.         She is survived by a daughter, Constance Cooper Batuscheck of Alexandria, Va.; a son, Kenneth, of Manhattan; a brother, David Buxbaum of Milwaukee, and a grandson.       
         Leona Dubnick, coordinator of the gifted-education program for the Huntington, L.I., public schools until her retirement in 1985, died on her 65th birthday Friday at the Williamsburg (Va.) Community Hospital. She lived in Huntington and Pound Ridge, N.Y., until moving to Williamsburg less than two years ago.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         A native of New York City, Mrs. Dubnick graduated from Brooklyn College, earned an M.A. at City College and studied for a doctorate at Teachers College of Columbia University. She joined the Huntington school system as a teacher and designed, developed and administered its gifted-education curriculum and program.         In the late 1970's she also created and broadcast "Ask the Teacher" radio programs at the Long Island station WGSM and at WVOX in Westchester. From 1988 to 1991 she was public-relations director, news editor and writer at WPOB-FM in Plainview-Old Bethpage, L.I.         Mrs. Dubnick is survived by her husband of 43 years, Dr. Lester Dubnick; her daughter, Monica L. Mowery of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a sister, Stella Monchick of West Palm Beach, Fla.       
         Tatiana Troyanos, an American mezzo-soprano whose enormous repertory covered the full range of operatic history, from Monteverdi to Philip Glass, died on Saturday evening at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 54 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Her manager, Janice Mayer at Columbia Artists, said the cause was cancer.         Miss Troyanos's dark, flexible mezzo was ideal for the wrenching emotionalism of such characters as Carmen, Kundry in Wagner's "Parsifal," Eboli in Verdi's "Don Carlo," Santuzza in Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana," and both Purcell's and Berlioz's Didos.         She was also a superb player of trouser roles. Her Octavian in "Rosenkavalier" was long the centerpiece of her repertory, and early in her career she gave highly regarded performances as Cherubino in "Le Nozze di Figaro" and Romeo in Bellini's "Capuletti e i Montecchi." And she was prized for the kind of vocal and dramatic agility, as well as the ability to learn difficult roles quickly, that made her a singer of choice for revivals of rarely performed Handel and Mozart works.         Her appearances in the last year indicate the scope of her repertory. In September she created the role of Queen Isabella in Philip Glass's "Voyage" at the Met. She performed in two "Ring" cycles, as Waltraute in the Metropolitan Opera's "Gotterdammerung" and Fricka in the Lyric Opera of Chicago's "Rheingold." In May she gave what James R. Oestreich called in The New York Times "a searching, almost harrowing reading" of the Mahler Third Symphony with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall, and last month she sang Clairon in the San Francisco Opera production of Strauss's "Capriccio."         Tatiana Troyanos was born in New York on September 12, 1938, and grew up in Forest Hills. Her mother was German and her father Greek, and though she admittedly neither spoke Greek nor cared for Greek food, she identified closely with her father's homeland and described herself as Greek-American.         Both her parents were singers, and she sang in school and church choruses, but her first serious musical training was as a pianist. It was only during her high school years, when she began to listen to Maria Callas recordings and attend Metropolitan Opera performances as a standee, that she decided to study singing. While working at Random House as a secretary she enrolled at the Juilliard School, but left when the dean refused to let her study with the teacher of her choice, Hans Heinz. She studied privately with him for many years, continuing even after she began to sing professionally.         Miss Troyanos found few opportunities in New York, but she was a fighter: When the Met offered her small roles, she turned them down, and when she was denied a chorus role in "The Sound of Music" because Richard Rodgers thought her too glamorous to play a nun, she returned looking disheveled and got the part. Her first break was in 1963, when Julius Rudel signed her to the New York City Opera roster. She made her debut that year as Hippolyta in Benjamin Britten's "Midsummer Night's Dream," and also sang Jocasta in Stravinsky's "Oedipus Rex."         In 1965, following Heinz's suggestion that she would benefit from experience at a European house, she joined the Hamburg State Opera, where she made her way through a large part of the mezzo-soprano repertory in her decade there. But her first major appearances were at Aix-en-Provence, France, where she made her debut in 1966 as the Composer in Strauss's "Ariadne auf Naxos," and at Covent Garden, where she performed her first Octavian in 1969, learning the role in a week to fill in for another singer.         Miss Troyanos made her Met debut as Octavian in 1976, and became one of the house's most frequently heard mezzos. Among the many roles she sang there were the Countess Geschwitz in Berg's "Lulu," Sesto in Mozart's "Clemenza di Tito," Charlotte in "Werther," Adalgisa in "Norma," and her regular showpieces, Carmen, Kundry, Santuzza and the Composer.         In addition to her opera appearances, Miss Troyanos was an eloquent recitalist. Particularly interesting in recent years were her duo recitals with the soprano Benita Valente. After their last New York performance together, at Alice Tully Hall in January 1992, Bernard Holland wrote in The Times: "Ms. Troyanos's mezzo-soprano is intended less as a thing of beauty (which it often is) than as a conduit for the pain, exaltation and rushes of emotion that suffuse her musical personality."  A Recorded Legacy         Miss Troyanos made many first-rate recordings. Among those available on compact disk are performances in Leonard Bernstein's recording of his "West Side Story" (Deutsche Grammophon), "Carmen" (London), "Werther" (Angel), "Cosi Fan Tutte" (RCA), "Le Nozze di Figaro" (Deutsche Grammophon) and Schoenberg's "Gurre-Lieder" (Philips). Her recent San Francisco appearance in "Capriccio" was taped for video release; other video performances include a memorable Sesto in the Jean-Pierre Ponelle production of "La Clemenza di Tito" (Deutsche Grammophon) and, with the Metropolitan Opera, Venus in Wagner's "Tannhauser" and Dido in Berlioz's "Troyens."         She is survived by her mother, Hildegard Fournier of Florida, and her brother, John, of New York.       
         Elise Reiman, a longtime teacher at the School of American Ballet, died on Thursday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was 79.         The cause was an aneurysm, said Norman E. Kappler, her nephew. Miss Reiman, who lived in New York, was taken to the hospital after she became ill on vacation in Winthrop, Me.         Miss Reiman, who was born in Terre Haute, Ind., studied with Adolph Bolm in San Francisco and danced in his 1928 production of "Apollon Musagete." She also studied at the School of American Ballet in its earliest years and danced with the American Ballet in 1935 and 1936 and with Ballet Society from 1946 to 1948. Both companies were forerunners of the New York City Ballet; like it, they were formed by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein.         Miss Reiman taught children's and beginning point classes from 1945 to 1953 and from 1964 through this summer. A keen-eyed teacher with a wry, deceptively lazy humor, she received the school's Mae L. Wien Award for distinguished service, in 1992.         Miss Reiman performed in the original productions of Balanchine's "Four Temperaments" and "Divertimento."         She was married to Charles W. Hotchkiss, who died in 1963. In addition to her nephew, she is survived by two stepsons, Frank Hotchkiss of Los Angeles and Charles Warner Hotchkiss 3d of Darien, Conn.       
         Muriel R. Carbery, a retired nursing school dean and hospital nursing director, died on Tuesday at home in Port Jefferson, L.I. She was 81.         From 1952 to 1974 Miss Carbery served as the director of the nursing service at New York Hospital. From 1958 to 1970 held the dual post of dean of the Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing.         After stepping down as dean, she continued as a professor and associate dean of the nursing school's continuing education division.         Miss Carbery, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Hunter College, where she trained to become a teacher of Greek and Latin. Because of the scarcity of jobs in the Depression, she worked briefly in a library, then decided to become a nurse and combine that profession with teaching. She graduated from New York Hospital School of Nursing in 1937 and later earned a master's degree in nursing education at Catholic University.         Her first nursing job, at New York Hospital, paid $65 a month plus board and room for a 48-hour week. She worked in surgery and private nursing and started teaching in 1940.         During World War II she served four years in the United States Army Nurse Corps in the Pacific. Her assignments included working in a 600-bed tent and tin-roof hospital in the jungles of New Guinea and in a 2,500-bed hospital in West New Guinea that was bombed in the fighting during Gen. Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines.         She reached the rank of major during active duty and retired from the reserve in 1970 as a colonel.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Morgan, of Marietta, Ga.       
         Stella Kramrisch, an authority on Indian art, a teacher and a curator, died on Tuesday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 97 and lived near Philadelphia.         Born in Mikulov, Austria, on May 29, 1896, Professor Kramrisch earned a doctorate of philosophy in Vienna in 1919. When she became the first professor of Indian art at the University of Calcutta in 1923 and published "Principles of Indian Art" in 1924, Professor Kramrisch laid the foundations for the systematic study of Indian art.         She personified that systematic study in the series of books that followed: "Indian Sculpture" (1932), "A Survey of Painting in the Deccan" (1937), "Indian Terracottas" (1939), "The Hindu Temple" (1946) and "Arts and Crafts of Travancore" (1948).         From 1932 to 1950 the professor co-edited the Journal of the Indian Society of Oriental Art. From 1937 to 1941 she lectured on Indian art at the Courtauld Institute in London. In 1950 she moved to the United States, where she was both professor of South Asian art at the University of Pennsylvania, and curator of Indian art at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. In 1964 she was appointed professor of Indian art at the Institute of Fine Arts at New York University.         Apart from teaching and writing, she was highly regarded as an exhibition organizer. Examples of her skill were "The Art of Nepal and Tibet" (1960), "Unknown India: Ritual Art in Tribe and Village" (1968) and "Himalayan Art 700-1900" (1978), all at the Philadelphia Museum of Art.         She produced a show, "Manifestations of Siva," for the Philadelphia Museum in 1981. The professor's last exhibition was "Painted Delight," a show of Mogul paintings, also at the Philadelphia, in 1986.       
         Dr. Barbara Biber Bodansky, a leading researcher in child psychology and early education for nearly half a century, died on Tuesday at the Jacob Perlow Hospice of Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 89.         Her family said she had had a long illness.         Dr. Biber -- the name she used professionally -- was chairman of the child development faculty of the Bank Street College of Education from 1931 to 1960. She directed its research division from 1950 to 1963.         In those positions, she played a central role in creating several new graduate and research programs dealing with early education theory, child psychology and social policy.         In 1973 she became a Distinguished Research Scholar Emeritus at the college, which is on 112th Street near Broadway and was founded in 1916 as a center for training and research in early childhood education. Strong Self-Images         As a teacher, Dr. Biber believed that the best early education programs develop the emotional life of children as well as their intellects, foster strong self-images, encourage responsibility to others, and support imagination and curiosity.         Toward that end, Dr. Biber, along with her colleagues at the college, helped to establish teacher workshops in New York City public schools in the 1940's and 50's.         In the 1960's she directed a study of schools and mental health with a $1 million grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health. At the end of that decade, she began devising the basic principles for federally financed day care and Head Start programs.         At the age of 80, she completed "Early Education and Psychological Development" (Yale University Press, 1984). She also was co-author of two books reporting major research studies: "Child Life in School" (1942) and "The Pyschological Impact of School Experience" (1969).         Dr. Biber, who was born in Brooklyn, first attended Barnard College and then graduated from the University of Chicago. She received a Ph.D. in psychology in 1942 from Columbia University.         In 1929, Dr. Biber was married to Dr. Oscar Bodansky, chief of clinical biochemistry at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. He died in 1977.         She is survived by a daughter, Margery B. Franklin of Manhattan; two grandsons, Kenneth and David Frankin, and a sister, Lilian Uviller Pilat.       
         Eda Helen Brooks, an actress and voice teacher, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.         Mrs. Brooks was in the original cast of "Chicago," which was the first show to appear at the Music Box Theater in the 1920's. She also toured on the Keith and Pantages theater circuits and appeared in Jerome Kern's "Cat and the Fiddle."         She retired from teaching in March.         Her daughter Patricia Brooks Mann, a soprano with the New York City Opera, died in January. She is survived by her other daughter, Joan Palermo of Manhattan; a stepson, Allan Brooks of Great Neck, L.I., and three grandsons. A service is to take place on Sunday at 2 P.M. at the John Kitril Funeral Home, 1297 First Avenue, at 70th Street.       
         Tatyana Nikolayeva, a Russian pianist widely respected for her interpretations of the music of Bach and Shostakovich, died on Monday in San Francisco. She was 69 and lived in Moscow.         The cause was a cerebral aneurism, said Jacques Leiser, her American manager. Miss Nikolayeva suffered a cerebral hemorrhage during a recital on Nov. 13 at the San Francisco Music Center. Stricken again soon afterward, she lost consciousness permanently. She was being treated at the California-Pacific Medical Center when she died.         Miss Nikolayeva was born on May 4, 1924, in Bezhitz, near Bryansk. She began piano study at the age of 5 with her mother. Her principal teacher was the renowned Aleksandr Goldenweiser, at the Moscow Conservatory, where she subsequently taught. Shared With Shostakovich         In 1950, she gained international recognition by winning a piano competition at the Leipzig Bach Festival. She impressed the jury, which included the composer Dmitri Shostakovich, by offering to play not merely the Bach prelude and fugue required, but any of the 48 preludes and fugues of Bach's "Well-Tempered Clavier," from memory.         Shostakovich was so taken with her performances that on his return to Moscow he wrote his own set of 24 Preludes and Fugues (Op. 87), sharing each of the pieces with her as it was finished. She gave the work's premiere, in 1952 in Leningrad, and developed a close friendship with the composer. Having also studied composition at the Moscow Conservatory, she herself became a composer as well as a performer.         "As time passes," Miss Nikolayeva wrote a few years ago of her Leipzig award, "I feel more and more that I received then another, not so concrete but no less important, prize: the creative and personal friendship of Dmitri Shostakovich; a friendship which lasted more than 25 years, to the day of his death."         Miss Nikolayeva began to appear regularly in the West only late in life. She made her American debut in 1992, with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. She gave her New York debut recitals on Oct. 30 and Nov. 3 this year, playing the Shostakovich preludes and fugues at the 92d Street Y. She went on to play Bach and Shostakovich in Philadelphia, and she was playing the complete set of preludes and fugues again in San Francisco when she was stricken.         She recorded the Shostakovich preludes and fugues three times, twice for Melodiya and most recently for Hyperion. She also recorded many keyboard works of Bach for Melodiya and other labels.         She is survived by a son, Kirill, who lives in Moscow.       
         Adelaide Hall, a singer whose Broadway career began in the 1921 revue "Shuffle Along" and who went on to become an international cabaret star, performing into her 90's, died on Sunday at Charing Cross Hospital in London. She was 92.         The cause was an infection after a fall, said Barry Sullivan, a friend.         Miss Hall's most recent appearance in New York City was in March at Weill Recital Hall, where she sang an exuberant program that ran from 1920's vaudeville tunes through Duke Ellington standards to such 1970's songs as "The Way We Were." Scat With Ellington         She first won prominence in 1927, for her wordless, growling obbligato in "Creole Love Call" with the Duke Ellington Orchestra. The next year, she introduced "I Can't Give You Anything but Love" in the Broadway revue "Blackbirds of 1928." Through the years, she also worked with Count Basie, Art Tatum and Fats Waller. She frequently embellished her concerts with reminiscences of Ellington, Ethel Waters, Cab Calloway, Al Capone, Josephine Baker and other notable figures she had encountered.         Miss Hall was born in Brooklyn and studied at Pratt Institute, where her father was a music teacher. After making her Broadway debut in 1921 in "Shuffle Along," a Eubie Blake-Noble Sissle revue, she starred in the 1923 revue "Runnin' Wild." In 1927, while she was touring in a revue with Duke Ellington, he heard her improvise a wordless countermelody to his "Creole Love Call." When they recorded it two days later, her vocal became an integral part of the piece; it is among the first recorded examples of "scat" singing.         In "Blackbirds of 1928," Miss Hall starred opposite Bill (Bojangles) Robinson, and when the show moved to Paris in 1929, Miss Hall went with it. She remained there and starred at the Moulin Rouge and the Lido. Moved to London         In 1936, she and her husband, Bert Hicks, opened a series of clubs in Paris and in London, which she was to make her home for half a century. In London's West End, she appeared in "Kiss Me Kate" (1951), "Love From Judy" (1952), "Someone to Talk To" (1956) and "Janie Jackson" (1968).         Miss Hall returned to Broadway in 1957 to appear in the show "Jamaica," with Lena Horne, Ricardo Montalban, Ossie Davis and Alvin Ailey. In 1989, she was the subject of a documentary film, "Sophisticated Lady."         Miss Hall's husband died in 1963.       
         Helen Marshall, an American painter and art teacher, died on Nov. 24 at her home in Lavenham, Sussex, England. She was 88.         Mrs. Marshall, who was born in New York City, studied art here and then in Paris, where she began teaching. She later taught at the Parsons School in New York City, where she headed the life drawing department. She had her first one-woman show in 1954 at the Durlacher Galleries in Manhattan. Her work was also shown by the Museum of Modern Art and the Whitney Museum of American Art.         Mrs. Marshall's husband of 50 years, H. Hannath Marshall, died in 1990.       
         Margaret Landon, whose novel "Anna and the King of Siam" was the inspiration for the Broadway musical "The King and I," died on Saturday at the Hermitage retirement home in Alexandria, Va. She was 90.         Although Mrs. Landon spent more than 10 years in Siam, now Thailand, it was not her story, but that of Anna Leonowens, that was the basis for Mrs. Landon's 1944 book. While living in Siam, Mrs. Landon discovered the autobiographical books by Anna Leonowens, a Welsh widow who was a governess, teacher and secretary in the court of King Mongkut in the 1860's.         The story in Mrs. Landon's book was told in a 1946 film starring Irene Dunne, as Anna, and Rex Harrison, as the king. But it was the 1956 musical by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d that immortalized the story of the Mrs. Leonowens and her extraordinary relationship with the King of Siam. 10 Years as a Missionary         Margaret Dorothea Mortensen was born in 1903 in Somers, Wis., and grew up in Evanston, Ill. A 1925 graduate of Wheaton College in Illinois, she married Kenneth Landon, a seminary student whom she met on campus, in 1926. In 1927 the couple set out for Siam as educational missionaries for the Presbyterian Church. There, Mrs. Landon discovered the books "The English Governess at the Siamese Court" and "The Romance of the Harem," and the letters of Mrs. Leonowens.         After 10 years in Siam, Mrs. Landon returned to the United States with her family in 1937. Beginning by writing articles about Anna Leonowens, Mrs. Landon eventually wove together history, biography and a fictionalization of the Welsh woman's story into her best-selling novel.         In 1942 Mrs. Landon moved with her family to Washington, where her husband was a Government specialist on Southeast Asia. She wrote one other book, "Never Dies the Dream," published in 1948.         Mrs. Landon's husband died on Aug. 26. She is survived by two daughters, Margaret Schoenherr of Palos Heights, Ill., and Carol Pearson of Clinton, S.C.; two sons, William, of Bellevue, Wash., and Kenneth Jr., of Washington; 13 grandchildren, and 27 great-grandchildren.
