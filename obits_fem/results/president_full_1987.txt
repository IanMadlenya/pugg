Elayne Hanley Varian, an art curator and exhibition organizer, died of cardiopulmonary arrest on Nov. 4 at her home in Orlando, Fla. She was 74 years old.         With her eye for the new and the lively, Mrs. Varian was best known in New York for the provocative shows of avant-garde art that she organized in the 1960's and 1970's as director of the contemporary wing of the Finch College Museum of Art. Among the more notable were a series called ''Art in Process,'' staged over an 11-year period ending in 1973, which exposed in detail the working methods and techniques of a number of contemporary artists; two ''Projected Art'' exhibitions of experimental films, videotapes and documentaries of artists at work; two Art Deco shows noted for scholarship and selectivity, and a documentary film by the artist Les Levine that portrayed the civil strife in northern Ireland. Mrs. Varian also taught courses in museology and art history at Finch.         Elayne Hanley was born in San Francisco on Oct. 10, 1913. She was graduated from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and later received a master's degree in fine art there. She came to New York in 1933 and worked for a while as a dress designer. She married John Varian, a lawyer, in 1936, and retired to raise their son.         In the mid-1940's, she joined the Duveen Brothers gallery, where she became assistant to the president, Edward Fowles, and remained there for 15 years. She went to Finch College as director of its contemporary museum in 1964, a position she held until the college closed for lack of funds in 1975.         In that year, Mrs. Varian moved to Orlando, where her husband had retired. For three years, she served as curator of contemporary art at the John and Mabel Ringling Museum in Sarasota. After leaving there in 1978, she did art appraisal work and mounted several shows as a freelance curator.         She is survived by her husband and by a son, Alfred, of Stowe, Vt.

        Septima Poinsette Clark, a teacher who had been active in civil rights activities since World War I, died Tuesday at a nursing home on John's Island. She was 89 years old.  Born in Charleston, the daughter of a former slave, Mrs. Clark was widely recognized for her work in civil rights. In 1964 she accompanied the Rev.         Septima Poinsette Clark, a teacher who had been active in civil rights activities since World War I, died Tuesday at a nursing home on John's Island. She was 89 years old.  Born in Charleston, the daughter of a former slave, Mrs. Clark was widely recognized for her work in civil rights. In 1964 she accompanied the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. to Norway when he was presented the Nobel Peace Prize.         ''The state has lost not only a leading civil rights activist but a legendary educator and humanitarian,'' Gov. Carroll A. Campbell Jr. said today.         Mrs. Clark attended Avery Institute in Charleston, and received a bachelor's degree from Benedict College in Columbia and a master's degree from Hampton Institute in Virginia. Worked in Teacher Campaign         She began her teaching career at a black public school on John's Island and, in 1918, accepted a teaching post at Avery. That year, she was instrumental in getting about 20,000 signatures on a petition to have black teachers hired by the Charleston County School District.         Mrs. Clark moved to Columbia in 1927 to teach and helped in a campaign to equalize teacher salaries.         She later was dismissed from a teaching job in Charleston for being a member of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         In the late 1950's she worked at the Highlander Folk School in Tennessee, where she developed a program to teach blacks to read and write well enough to pass voter literacy tests. She lectured around the country and later became a director of the school and a supervisor of teacher training for the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.         Her autobiography, ''Echo In My Soul,'' was published in 1962.         In 1974, Mrs. Clark was elected to the Charleston County School Board.         Mrs. Clark received a Living Legacy Award from President Carter in 1979 and the Order of the Palmetto, South Carolina's highest civilian award, in 1982.         She is survived by a son, Nerie D. Clark Jr., of Hickory, N.C., a sister and two brothers.

        Marguerite Yourcenar, a writer and classical scholar and the first woman to be named to the Academie Francaise, died Thursday night at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 84 years old.         Marguerite Yourcenar, a writer and classical scholar and the first woman to be named to the Academie Francaise, died Thursday night at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 84 years old.         Miss Yourcenar was a cosmopolitan, versatile woman of letters who wrote in her native French. To English-speaking readers, she was best known for her fiction, especially her 1951 novel ''Memoirs of Hadrian.'' Her other writings included essays, memoirs and plays.         On hearing of her death, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France said yesterday in Paris: ''French letters has just lost an exceptional woman. On the strength of a classical and rigorous style, Marguerite Yourcenar used a very personal tone to find, thanks to history, the occasion for a strong reflection on morality and power.'' 'Words Will Be Read Forever'         Roger W. Straus, the president and chief executive officer of Farrar Straus & Giroux, which has published works by Miss Yourcenar, said yesterday in a statement released at the Manhattan headquarters of the publishing house: ''Marguerite Yourcenar was without question or doubt one of the great writers of the 20th century. She is a great loss to the literary community, but her words will be read and remembered forever.''         Born in Brussels of a French father and Belgian mother, Miss Yourcenar grew up in France and traveled widely. On a visit to the United States early in World War II, she decided to stay when, as she once put it, ''the months stretched into years as the war didn't end.'' For the next decade she taught comparative literature at Sarah Lawrence College. She acquired United States citizenship in 1947 but was later reinstated as a citizen of France.         ''I am rootless,'' she told an interviewer in 1979. ''To steal from Hadrian, 'I am at home everywhere and nowhere.' ''         Her induction into the Academie Francaise in 1981 was an accolade that had been denied to Mme. de Stael, Colette and other illustrious Frenchwomen in the four-century history of that prestigious society of 40 ''immortals,'' the arbiters of French language and literature. 'Let Their Shadows Pass'         Commenting on her induction, Miss Yourcenar said: ''This uncertain, floating me, whose existence I myself dispute, here it is, surrounded, accompanied by an invisible troupe of women who perhaps should have received this honor long before, so that I am tempted to stand aside to let their shadows pass.''         She also said the academy was not to blame for not admitting women sooner. ''One cannot say,'' she said, ''that in French society, so impregnated with feminine influences, the academy has been a notable misogynist: it simply conformed to the custom that willingly placed a woman on a pedestal but did not permit itself to officially offer her a chair.''         Miss Yourcenar was respected as a classical scholar as well as a literary stylist. The Oxford University classicist Hugh Lloyd-Jones, writing in The New York Times Book Review in February 1985, praised her ''ornamental and melliflous French prose, studded with the literary allusions which come so easily to such a cultivated writer.'' Mixing Scholarship and Magic         Miss Yourcenar once said her writing had ''one foot in scholarship, the other in magic arts,'' and her interests were diverse.         Shortly before her death, in an interview with Jean-Pierre Corteggiani for the new quarterly Normal, Miss Yourcenar spoke of her views on literature:         ''The books I like best are those where there is intelligence, goodness and no injustice. They are very rare indeed. I think that the reason there is so much bad literature, or at least one of the reasons, is that the average person who sets out to be a writer goes around looking for subjects to write about, and editors have the effrontery to ask you: 'Could you not possibly write a novel about . . . or an essay on . . .,' to which I always reply that I never write anything I have not chosen myself.''         Her works ranged from ''Memoirs of Hadrian'' - an imaginary autobiography of the Roman emperor written as a letter to his grandson Marcus Aurelius - to a volume of stories, ''Oriental Tales'' (first published in 1938 in French), that drew on the folklore of medieval Japan and other cultures. Translated American Spirituals         She also wrote plays, poems and prose poems and translated into French the lyrics of American spirituals as well as works by such authors as James Baldwin, the modern Greek poet Constantine Cavafy, Henry James, Thomas Mann, Yukio Mishima and Virginia Woolf.         The Hadrian novel was widely considered Miss Yourcenar's magnum opus. The author Stephen Koch wrote in The Times Book Review in September 1985 that the work ''has riches for anyone interested in history, humanism or the psychology of power.'' When it was first published, he recalled, ''it was immediately incrusted with the mixed and marmoreal honor of being called a classic in its own time.''         Miss Yourcenar's criticism was praised by John Gross in The Times. Reviewing the English translation of her book ''The Dark Brain of Piranesi and Other Essays,'' Mr. Gross called her ''an outstanding critic'' and said the essays in the book were notably lucid and ''forceful, deeply pondered, the record of a full imaginative response.''         The rest of her work, which drew on her familiarity with several languages and literatures, remained less widely known until she was named to the Academie Francaise. In subsequent years, translations of her writing came out more frequently. Translations Are Published         In April, ''Two Lives and a Dream,'' a volume containing three stories by Miss Yourcenar, was published in an English translation by Walter Kaiser in collaboraton with the author.         The book had come out in 1982 in France, and the stories it contained were revisions of writing Miss Yourcenar did decades earlier. Farrar Straus & Giroux is to publish a paperback edition in April.         ''Mishima: a Vision of the Void,'' a short study by Miss Yourcenar of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, was published here in 1986.         Farrar Straus is also scheduled to publish a collection of essays and literary criticism next spring titled ''That Mighty Sculptor, Time.'' In addition, Farrar Straus is to publish three volumes of autobiography by Ms. Yourcenar, but no publication dates have been set.         The other books by Miss Yourcenar that have appeared in the United States in English translation include, in addition to ''Memoirs of Hadrian,'' ''Coup de Grace'' (1957), ''The Abyss'' (1976), ''Fires'' (1981), ''A Coin in Nine Hands'' (1982), ''The Dark Brain of Piranesi'' (1984), ''Alexis'' (1984) and ''Oriental Tales'' (1985). Read Racine at 8         Miss Yourcenar was born June 8, 1903, the only child of Michel de Crayencour and the former Fernande de Cartier de Marchienne. The name Yourcenar - which she assumed personally and professionally in the 1920's - is an imperfect anagram of the name Crayencour.         Her mother died when Marguerite was less than a month old, and she was educated, largely by tutors, under the direction of her father. As an 8-year-old, she was already reading the work of the 17th-century French dramatist Racine, and as a teen-ager she had two small books of verse published.         Then, as an independently wealthy young woman, she traveled widely, wrote essays, poems and fiction, and won praise as a novelist. In 1950, after settling in the United States, Miss Yourcenar and her American friend and companion, Grace Frick, bought the house in Northeast Harbor - on Mount Desert Island off the Maine coast -that became their longtime home. Miss Frick, who translated ''Memoirs of Hadrian'' and other works by Miss Yourcenar into English, died in 1979.         Miss Yourcenar was known to have prepared a tombstone for her eventual grave, complete up to the final two digits of the date of her death. In the interview with Normal, Miss Yourcenar said she had met a Frenchwoman who was horrified that she had even put the first two numbers of her death date on the marker. ''So she said 'but why should you not live to the year 2000?' I have absolutely no desire to live till the year 2000,'' Miss Yourcenar said. ''The year 2000 is not for me.''         Miss Yourcenar was awarded honorary degrees by Smith, Bowdoin and Colby colleges. She also won numerous European literary prizes, was decorated by the French and Belgian Governments and was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and the Academy of the French Language and Literature of Belgium.         There are no known survivors.       
        Hebe Dorsey, the fashion editor of The International Herald Tribune and a major figure in the fashion world, died of cancer yesterday morning at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. She was 62 years old and had been working for the paper for about 40 years.         Hebe Dorsey, the fashion editor of The International Herald Tribune and a major figure in the fashion world, died of cancer yesterday morning at the American Hospital in Neuilly-sur-Seine, near Paris. She was 62 years old and had been working for the paper for about 40 years.         Known for her irreverence and for fascination with society, Mrs. Dorsey frequently combined fashion and social reporting, and was in fact a member of the international social set herself.         A witty and somewhat acerbic commentator, Mrs. Dorsey was a force in fashion circles in New York and Tokyo as well as Paris.         ''She had the courage to report fashion critically,'' said Bill Blass, the designer, who remembered meeting her soon after World War II in Paris with Art Buchwald and other Tribune contributors. She was somewhat blase in those days, and she never really changed her attitude, he said. ''She liked the social aspects of fashion and she drew the connection between the two worlds,'' he added.         Hebe (pronounced ay-bay) Dorsey was born March 5, 1925, in Sousse, Tunisia, one of five children of Mary and Clement Halfon. After attending a French high school, she went on to study English and French at the Sorbonne. She became a contributor to The Herald Tribune when it was the European edition of The New York Herald Tribune. At about the same time, she married Frank Dorsey, a copy editor there, according to her brother, Leon Halfon. They were divorced some years ago. Award From Fashion Group         Earlier this fall she was one of five nominees for the journalism award given by the French Federation of Couture Ready to Wear and Creators of Fashion, an organization of trade groups. On Jan. 11, she was to receive an award for international journalism from the Council of Fashion Designers of America in New York.         ''She had an appointment next week to be fitted for the dress she was planning to wear,'' Mr. Blass said. ''It was a simple little short red satin strapless dress trimmed in fake leopard.''         Christian Lacroix said he would miss ''her sharpness, her acute sense of analysis and her style.'' She had ''helped launch us,'' France's newest couturier said, and he was happy that she was in New York in October when the first showing of his fashions was held in this country. Mrs. Dorsey was one of the first women to be seen in a Lacroix design, turning up at parties in his strapless red pouf-skirt dress. 'The Girl From Tunis'         ''I think of her as the girl from Tunis who was so involved with her family,'' Mr. Lacroix said, ''not of the dragon-like editor who was so intimidating at the fashion shows.''         He had lunch with her 10 days ago at the Ritz in Paris. ''She was wearing a Valentino suit with a fox collar and all her diamonds - she was in great spirits.''         Mrs. Dorsey generally wore clothes from such French couture houses as Chanel, Yves Saint Laurent and Lacroix, but would occasionally turn up in, say, a blue denim suit by an unknown tailor. She was also interested in jewelry and decorating.         ''Hebe revolutionized fashion writing,'' said John Fairchild, chairman of Fairchild Publications. ''She invented the idea of reviewing fashion like a play and she always did it with a razor, not a knife.''         John Vinocur, executive editor of The Herald Tribune, called her ''loyal, fierce, enormously generous and wildly funny.'' He said she could be ''enormously entertaining in two languages,'' switching from French to English ''without losing an ounce of wit.'' Streak of Irreverence         Her irreverence is illustrated by the article she wrote a few years ago after being bannned from a Christian Dior fashion show for an unfavorable review of the house's previous collection. Instead of lamenting the ban, she described using the free time to have her hair done, go shopping and take care of other chores she would not otherwise have had time for.         She entertained lavishly, both in her large apartment on the Boulevard Malesherbes in Paris and her pied-a-terre on the East Side of Manhattan.         ''She helped put fashion in the public eye,'' said Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, publisher of The New York Times and co-chairman of The Herald Tribune. ''She had a good time with her life,'' added his wife, Carol Sulzberger, a friend of Mrs. Dorsey.         Walter N. Thayer, chairman of Whitney Communications and president of The Herald Tribune, commented, ''She was a great lady and a wonderful person who had friends in all walks of life.'' An 'Excellent' Reporter         ''I met her 30 years ago when she was a young fashion writer and I was a fashion writer on the 'Today' show,'' Barbara Walters said. ''She never took herself too seriously, though she knew fashion was a serious business.''         Her book, ''La Belle Epoque,'' a compilation of pieces from The Herald Tribune recalling Paris in its heyday, was published there last year. She also wrote a monthly column for French Vogue and contributed articles on fashion and decorating to other publications such as The New York Times.         She is survived by three sisters, Zilia Sfez of Tunisia, Yvonne Brami of Nice and Nelly Cohen of Versailles, in addition to her brother. Her son, Joseph, is a photographer in Paris, and her daughter, Monika, lives in New York City.         The family requests that instead of flowers contributions be made to the Samuel Waxman Cancer Research Foundation, 1150 Fifth Avenue, New York, N.Y. 10128.         Burial will be tomorrow at 10:30 A.M. at the Pantin cemetery outside Paris.         A memorial service in New York is being planned by Miss Walters, Marilyn Evins, the fashion publicist, and other friends.

She was in her 80's and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Johns, a native of Ohio, came to New York just before World War II and established what became S. Irene Johns Inc., which she operated until its merger into Kirby Block Inc. about 10 years ago. She also served on volunteer committees to promote the city's fashion industry and on the State Attorney General's consumer-fraud commission.         Over the years, Mrs. Johns headed many charitable, civic and professional organizations, and she was president of the American Women Buyers Club for 12 years.         Mrs. Johns is survived by a son, Robert, of Manhattan.       
        Representative Sala Burton, a California Democrat who succeeded her late husband in Congress in 1983 and carried on his liberal policies, died today of complications arising from cancer. She was 61.         Representative Sala Burton, a California Democrat who succeeded her late husband in Congress in 1983 and carried on his liberal policies, died today of complications arising from cancer. She was 61.         Tom Schulz, a nephew of Mrs. Burton, said she died at 8:22 P.M. at the George Washington University Hospital here.         ''Mrs. Burton, recently hospitalized for further treatment and recuperation from cancer surgery, experienced a sudden decline this weekend after an apparent stabilization of her illness,'' Mr. Schulz said.  Mrs. Burton underwent surgery for colon cancer surgery in August. Her last public appearance was on Dec. 9. Swearing-in Was Delayed         Mrs. Burton arrived at her Congressional office for the opening day of Congress on Jan. 6, after insisting that she would appear. However, later in the day she became ill and was forced to leave before the swearing-in ceremonies of the 100th Congress.         The House passed a resolution allowing her to be sworn-in at home, and the oath was administered Jan. 7 by the chairman of the California delegation, Don Edwards, also a Democrat.         ''She took the oath, signed all the papers, and gave me a bottle of champagne,'' Mr. Edwards said. Mrs. Burton entered the George Washington University Hospital the next day. Re-elected in 1984 and 1986         Mrs. Burton, who represented a large portion of San Francisco, was a member of the House Rules Committee. She was elected in 1983 to complete the term of her husband, Phillip, and was re-elected in 1984 and 1986.         Although Phillip Burton was one of Congress' leading liberals, his widow traced her interest in politics to her teen-age years, when she and her parents fled Poland ahead of the Nazi occupation forces.         ''I saw and felt what happened in Western Europe when the Nazis were moving,'' she once said. ''You learn that politics is everybody's business.''         Politics was her business most of the time after she met her husband in 1950 at a convention of the California Young Democrats. 'She Astounded Everybody'         Phillip Burton spent nearly two decades in Congress and championed his liberal causes with a brash style.         ''Phil was so overwhelming he would just take over when he walked into a room,'' Mr. Edwards recalled recently. ''It tended to put her in the role as a shy wife. But she was operating all the time.         ''When Phil died, she astounded everybody,'' he said. ''First, she was on the Education and Labor Committee.'' When she got on Rules, she was among the very strongest members for national Democratic Party policies. She was an advocate for poor people, education, the environment, and arms reduction. She was a pillar of strength. She didn't give an inch.'' When she returned to the House after her operation last year, Mrs. Burton was welcomed back with a speech by Representative Thomas P. O'Neill Jr., then Speaker of the House. Democratic Party Activities         In the 1950's Mrs. Burton helped organize the California Democratic Council and served as its vice president. She was a delegate to three national Democratic Party conventions.         She also worked closely with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People to end discrimination in employment and housing.         From 1972 through 1974, she was president of the Democratic Wives of the House and Senate. She was legislative chairman of the Women's National Democratic Club and its liaison to the House.         Friends said she viewed her job of representing three-quarters of San Francisco's 678,000 residents as a family legacy. After winning the seat, she moved into offices at a Federal building in San Francisco that had been renamed for her husband.         REPRESENTATIVE SALA BURTON, 61

In 1920, she married Frederick Johnson Manning, a history professor who then moved from Yale to Swarthmore College.         Mrs. Manning is survived by two daughters, Helen Manning Hunter, an economics professor at Bryn Mawr, and Caroline Cunningham, a teacher at the Manhattan School of Music.

Sarah Goddard Power, New York City's deputy assistant secretary of state for human rights and social affairs in 1980 and 1981, died in a fall Tuesday from Burton Tower on the campus of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. She was 52 years old and lived in Ann Arbor.         The authorities said they believed her fall from the eighth floor of the 212-foot tower was a suicide.

Her husband, Philip, is chairman of the Surburban Communications Corporation in Livonia, Mich., the publisher of 50 newspapers in the Detroit and Cincinnati areas. His family gave $3.9 million to build the Power Center for the Performing Arts on the Ann Arbor campus.         The university's president, Harold T. Shapiro, said yesterday that Mrs. Power's death was ''a great loss for the university, for the state and for those committed to more progressive social policy.'' Michigan's Governor, James J. Blanchard, called her a ''brilliant and vibrant caring person committed to women's rights and equality.''         From 1966 to 1969, Mrs. Power was executive director of the New York City Commission for the United Nations and Consular Corps in the administration of Mayor John V. Lindsay.

        Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Former United States Representative Edith Green, a leading advocate of aid to education and women's rights and an early opponent of the Vietnam War, died of cancer Tuesday night in Tualatin, Ore. She was 77 years old.         Mrs. Green, a Democrat, started out as a schoolteacher and went on to serve 10 years in Congress.         After defeating Tom McCall, who later became Governor of Oregon, Mrs. Green represented the state's Third Congressional District from 1954 to 1974. She rose to the second-highest position on the House Education and Labor Committee and served as chairwoman of its Subcommittee on Higher Education. In that capacity, she pushed for passage of legislation creating the first Federal scholarships for college undergraduates.         Senator Mark O. Hatfield, a Republican who was a friend of Mrs. Green for 40 years, said yesterday: ''She was probably the most powerful woman ever to serve in the Congress. On any important legislation, such as women's rights or education or dealing with minorities or poor people, she could switch people's votes on the floor through the power of her intellect and her ability to persuade. People listened because when Edith Green spoke, she spoke from the heart as well as the mind.'' Role in Anti-Poverty Legislation         In 1967, for example, Mrs. Green played a key, though behind-the-scenes, role in passage of major anti-poverty legislation proposed by President Johnson. In large part through her efforts, a coalition of Republicans and Southern Democrats against the bill was splintered when she drafted and lobbied for an amendment that met the demands of some of the Southerners. Despite those efforts, President Johnson and Mrs. Green did not like each other, largely because of her early opposition to the buildup of troops in Vietnam.         Mrs. Green, a native of South Dakota, went to Willamette University in Salem, Ore., in the late 1920's and, after graduating, started teaching elementary school in Salem, according to a son, James S. Green of Gresham, Ore. She became involved in politics after working with the Oregon Education Association.         She was a delegate to the 1956 Democratic National Convention and a member of the platform committee. At the urging of the candidate, she gave a seconding speech for the Presidential nomination of Adlai E. Stevenson. Four years later, she was asked to second the nomination of John F. Kennedy for President. At the time, she was serving as chairman of the Kennedy campaign committee in Oregon. President Kennedy later named her as a member of the Presidential Commission on the Status of Women. And he also offered her the ambassadorship to Canada, but she declined. Advocate for Women's Rights         Mr. Green said his mother was a supporter of women's rights, but without stridence. ''She realized that she had to work with the men before she knocked them over,'' Mr. Green said. ''The key is to work with them, she said, and she was very good at it. I think her colleagues would testify to that.''         Mr. Hatfield said Mrs. Green ''probably had more direct personal role in writing education-related legislation than any other person.'' He also described her as ''foremost in the effort to bring about equal pay for equal work.''         And, the Senator continued: ''She also was remarkable in this business that I'm in, in that she could walk away from it, which she did at the height of her career. She did not run again when she could have been re-elected for life.'' Mrs. Green did not seek re-election in 1974.         After retiring, she became a professor of government at Warner Pacific College and in 1976 she served as co-chairwoman of the National Democrats for Gerald Ford. In 1979, she was appointed to serve on the Oregon Board of Higher Education.         Besides her son James, Mrs. Green's survivors include another son, Richard, of Annandale, Va.; two sisters, Ruth Costello of Berkeley Springs, W.Va., and Mildred Cleaveland of San Andreas, Calif.; and four grandchildren. week, but details were not complete yesterday.

She was 63 years old and also had a home on Shelter Island, L.I.         Ms. Mann, the first woman to become president of the Tax Commission, was among Mayor Koch's first-term appointments.         She was the only full-time commissioner on the seven-member panel, which resolves disputes between the city and its taxpayers. The commission reviews complaints about real-property assessments, adjusts those where warranted and grants or denies exemptions. Left Post Several Weeks Ago         Ms. Mann, who was known as Bettie, remained at her post until several weeks ago, her associates say. On April 2, Mayor Koch went to her apartment to present her with a medal for outstanding service to the city.         She came to her post after serving as director of legal services for the New York State Board of Equalization and Assessment in Albany, which solves property-tax problems statewide. She earned a reputation there as a superb lawyer and researcher, an evenhanded mediator and an authority in her field.         Ms. Mann was born in Pine Bluff, Ark., and grew up in St. Petersburg, Fla. She graduated from Vassar College and, in 1948, from the Vanderbilt University Law School, where she was an editor of the Vanderbilt Law Review.         She worked as a consultant for the State Board of Equalization, and joined the staff and became director of legal services in 1976.

        Helen M. Strauss, who created the literary department at the William Morris agency and became a major influence in the worlds of books, motion pictures and the theater, died of cancer yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. Miss Strauss, 83 years old and a resident of Manhattan, had been ill for almost a year.         Helen M. Strauss, who created the literary department at the William Morris agency and became a major influence in the worlds of books, motion pictures and the theater, died of cancer yesterday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in Manhattan. Miss Strauss, 83 years old and a resident of Manhattan, had been ill for almost a year.         Miss Strauss was born in New York City, and began her career with the story department of Paramount Pictures before joining the Morris agency in 1944. Until then the agency had handled mostly show business figures, but Miss Strauss was asked to establish the literary department. She also served for more than 20 years as a member of the company's executive committee.         Miss Strauss put together a formidable client list that eventually included James Michener, Robert Penn Warren, Leon Edel, Ralph Ellison, Dame Edith Sitwell, Archibald MacLeish, Gore Vidal, Gerold Frank, Betty Smith, Justice William O. Douglas and Frank Yerby.         Mr. Michener, one of Miss Strauss's early clients and one of six who won the Pulitzer Prize, dedicated the Modern Library edition of his selected writings to her as a ''friend of writers.'' 'Gave Me Only Good Counsel'         Yesterday, he described Miss Strauss as an ''admirable'' agent. ''She did not hold a writer's hand or get him tickets to a favorite show or buy him shirts at Macy's,'' he said. ''What she did was advise him on the problems of his profession. She helped enormously those she took under her wing, and I was one of her first clients, and had a long, very happy relationship with her. She gave me only good counsel.'' But Miss Strauss was not a friend of all writers. Her 1979 autobiography, ''A Talent for Luck,'' gave what one reviewer described as ''a brief twist of the knife'' to writers she did not like, either personally or professionally. In fact, she attributed part of her success to not hesitating to drop writers who displeased her.         Mr. Frank said yesterday that Miss Strauss had run her department with an iron hand. ''She was autocratic, firm and decisive, but very loyal,'' he said. ''And she knew what made a book work.''         Owen Laster, who succeeded Miss Strauss as head of the Morris literary department, described her as dynamic and controversial. ''But above all,'' he said, ''she had an eye for selecting and working with extraordinarily talented writers.'' 'The King and I' Her Idea         Miss Strauss was credited with originating the idea of ''The King and I,'' the musical by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d starring Gertrude Lawrence.         She moved to the Morris agency's London office in 1966, but resigned from the company a year later to become vice president of world story operations for Warner Brothers-Seven Arts. She later joined Universal Pictures as a vice president, and in the early 1970's she was in charge of motion picture production for Reader's Digest Films. She produced ''The Incredible Sarah,'' a 1976 film starring Glenda Jackson as Sarah Bernhardt.         Miss Strauss spoke little about her personal life, and even her autobiography described an early marriage as ''a fiasco, though all my friends thought he was charming.''         There are no survivors, and friends said funeral arrangements would be private.         HELEN M. STRAUSS DIES AT 83       
        Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Rita Hayworth, the legendary Hollywood beauty who rose to international fame in the 1940's and 1950's, died Thursday night, of Alzheimer's disease, in her Central Park West apartment in Manhattan. She was 68 years old.         Since 1981 the actress had been under the care of her second daughter, Princess Yasmin Aga Khan, who by publicizing her mother's tragic illness had drawn national and international attention to Alzheimer's disease, about which little was known until recent years.         According to Princess Yasmin, Miss Hayworth's health had steadily deteriorated over the years and she lapsed into a semicoma in February.         The ''courage and candor'' of Miss Hayworth and her family in bringing attention to Alzheimer's disease was praised by President Reagan in a statement yesterday.         ''Rita Hayworth was one of our country's most beloved stars,'' he said. ''Glamorous and talented, she gave us many wonderful moments on the stage and screen and delighted audiences from the time she was a young girl.         ''Nancy and I are saddened by Rita's death. She was a friend whom we will miss.'' The Epitome of Glamour         Rita Hayworth was the epitome of Hollywood glamour and allure, a stunningly beautiful actress and dancer.         During World War II, her pinup pictures decorated barracks walls and ships' bulkheads wherever servicemen went, and over two decades her often tempestuous romantic life thrust her into the headlines.         Fred Astaire, who co-starred with her in two movies, said in his autobiography that she was his favorite dancing partner, and dancing was, indeed, one of her genuine talents.         As a singer, however, she was not similarly gifted, even though she was cast in many musicals. Anita Ellis dubbed Miss Hayworth's songs in four movies, including ''Pal Joey'' and ''The Loves of Carmen,'' and other ''ghosts'' did the singing for her in other films.         But that mattered little to Hayworth fans, who admired her chiefly for the sensuality she exuded, playing temptresses in movies such as ''Blood and Sand'' and ''The Lady From Shanghai.'' The Temptress of 'Gilda'         A particularly memorable temptress role was the title one in ''Gilda,'' in 1946, in which she did a striptease, demure by today's standards, inasmuch as it was limited to removing her arm-length gloves. While the controversial strip scene dazzled tens of thousands of young males, it upset more conservative people across the nation.         So did Miss Hayworth's open affair, in the late 1940's, when such behavior was far less commonplace than it is today, with Prince Aly Khan, the playboy son of the spiritual leader of millions of Ismaili Moslems. They were married in 1949, but she divorced him, as she did four other husbands, including Orson Welles.         As Miss Hayworth grew older, she successfully shifted from her glamour image and took on mature roles in movies such as ''Separate Tables'' in 1958 and ''They Came to Cordura'' in 1959. But by the late 1960's she was appearing in minor movies, most of them made in Europe.         And ultimately, the once-idolized star's health was ravaged by Alzheimer's disease - senile dementia, a devastating mental illness that affects the brain, brings on loss of memory, and ravages bodily functions - which left her ''utterly helpless,'' according to Princess Yasmin.         Miss Hayworth was truly born to show business, in New York City, on Oct. 17, 19l8. Her father, Eduardo Cansino, was a Spanish-born dancer and her mother, the former Volga Haworth, had been a Ziegfeld Follies showgirl. They named their daughter Margarita Carmen Cansino, but she shortened the name to Rita Cansino when she began dancing professionally at the age of 12, and kept that name for her first 10 movies. Spotted by a Fox Producer         Mr. Cansino's career took the family to Los Angeles, where his daughter attended school through the ninth grade. Then she joined her father's act and performed in clubs in Tijuana and Agua Caliente, Mexico, where, when she was 16 years old, she was spotted by a Fox Film Company producer, who signed her to a contract.         Making her film debut in 1935 in ''Under the Pampas Moon,'' Rita Cansino appeared in a succession of lesser roles, such as that of a dance hall girl in a Spencer Tracy movie called ''Dante's Inferno.'' Other films in her Cansino period included ''Charlie Chan in Egypt,'' ''Human Cargo'' and ''Meet Nero Wolfe.''         The Fox company's merger with 20th-Century Pictures left the young dancer without a contract, but in 1937 she met and married the man who was to become her Svengali and dramatically change her career fortunes. He was Edward Judson, a shrewd businessman 22 years her senior, under whose guidance she had her eyebrows and hairline altered by electrolysis and transformed herself from a raven-haired Latin to an auburn-haired cosmopolitan.         As her manager, Mr. Judson also changed his wife's professional name, choosing her mother's maiden name of Haworth and adding a ''y'' to clarify the pronunciation. He hired press agents to get the name and picture of Rita Hayworth into newspapers and fan magazines, and ultimately won her a seven-year contract at Columbia Pictures.         But low-budget B movies continued to be Miss Hayworth's lot, except for the 1939 ''Only Angels Have Wings,'' with Cary Grant, in which the director, Howard Hawks, cast her as an unfaithful wife. It was the secondary female role, but one that got the actress her first good critical notices. A 'Love Goddess' Emerges         Beginning in 1941, Miss Hayworth rapidly developed into one of Hollywood's most glamorous stars, inspiring Winthrop Sargent, a Life magazine writer, to dub her ''The Great American Love Goddess,'' a sobriquet that she welcomed and that caught the public's fancy.         On loan to Warner Brothers, Miss Hayworth appeared opposite James Cagney in ''Strawberry Blonde'' in 1941 and, back at Columbia, she achieved full star status when she was cast as Mr. Astaire's dancing partner in ''You'll Never Get Rich,'' a 1941 hit that got her a Time magazine cover article and instant celebrity. In 1942, she appeared in three hit movies, ''My Gal Sal,'' ''Tales of Manhattan'' and ''You Were Never Lovelier,'' the last again as Mr. Astaire's co-star.         Her performance in ''Cover Girl,'' with Gene Kelly in 1944, earned Miss Hayworth the attention of Life magazine, which printed a photograph of her, posed seductively in black lace, that became famous around the world as an American servicemen's pinup. In what was intended, no doubt, as the ultimate compliment, the picture was even pasted to a test atomic bomb that was dropped on Bikini atoll in 1946.         Miss Hayworth, unlike stars who claimed to deplore their own publicity, reveled in hers. ''Why should I mind?'' she said. ''I like having my picture taken and being a glamorous person. Sometimes when I find myself getting impatient, I just remember the times I cried my eyes out because nobody wanted to take my picture at the Trocadero.''         A great boost to Miss Hayworth's career was ''Gilda,'' which ran into censorship trouble in some areas because of the so-called strip scene. In it, she wore a clinging black satin strapless gown and, while coyly peeling off long black gloves, sang a mildly suggestive song called ''Put the Blame on Mame.'' Actually, the voice was that of Anita Ellis. Marriage to Orson Welles         Miss Hayworth, who had divorced her first husband, married Orson Welles in 1943, and they had a daughter, Rebecca. While Mr. Welles was directing her in one of her best films, ''The Lady From Shanghai'' (1949), she filed for divorce from him. Miss Hayworth had met and fallen in love with Prince Aly Khan and, since neither was divorced at the time, their travels together through Europe provoked some public indignation.         When they were married in 1949, the fact that Miss Hayworth was visibly pregnant was widely reported. She divorced Aly Khan two years later and was subsequently married to and divorced from the singer Dick Haymes and then James Hill, a movie producer.         Miss Hayworth's more than 40 films also included ''Affair in Trinidad'' (1952), ''Salome'' and ''Miss Sadie Thompson'' (1953), ''Fire Down Below'' (1957), ''The Story on Page One'' (1960), ''The Poppy Is Also a Flower'' (1967), and ''The Wrath of God'' (1972).         She attempted a stage career in 1971, but it ended abruptly because she was unable to remember her lines. Six years later, a court in Santa Ana, Calif., named an administrator for her affairs on the recommendation of a physician who said she was disabled by chronic alcoholism.         Despite her heavy drinking, however, it later appeared that the diagnosis of alcoholism might have been erroneous and that Miss Hayworth was actually suffering from the first stages of Alzheimer's disease.         In June 1981, a court in Los Angeles declared the actress legally unable to care for herself and she was put in the care of Princess Yasmin, who took her to New York to live. In 1985 the Princess married a Greek shipping executive, Basil Embiricos, but the marriage was short-lived. They had a son, Andrew. Miss Hayworth's other daughter, Rebecca Welles, lives in Tacoma, Wash.         Princess Yasmin, testifying in 1983 before a Congressional committee concerned with appropriating funds for Alzheimer's disease research, said that the disease had reduced her mother to ''a state of utter helplessness.''         The Princess's appearance was among her many efforts in recent years to draw attention to Alzheimer's disease. She has taken a major role in the growth of the Alzheimer's Disease and Related Disorders Association Inc., which has headquarters in Chicago and more than 130 chapters and affiliates, backing some 500 family-support groups. She is vice president of that organization and president of Alzheimer's Disease International, which she helped organize in 1985.         A funeral service for Miss Hayworth will be held Monday at 10 A.M. in the Church of the Good Shepherd, Beverly Hills, Calif.

        Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Justine Wise Polier, a retired New York City Family Court judge and a leader and recognized authority in the field of juvenile justice and children's rights, died Friday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. She was 84 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Judge Polier retired from the bench in 1973 after 38 years in the Family Court, which was known as Domestic Relations Court when Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia appointed her to it in 1935.         The daughter of a civil libertarian, Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, she was the first woman to hold a judicial office above magistrate in the state.         As a judge, she fought strenuously for an improved Family Court and for better care for the children, especially from poor families, who came before it. She also helped establish a mental-health unit in the court. Children's Rights Advocate         After retiring, she continued her battle for children's rights as a leader of several organizations. She was the director of the juvenile justice division of the Children's Defense Fund, the president of the Marion E. Kenworthy-Sarah H. Swift Foundation and a director of the Tappanz Foundation.         Judge Polier's counsel was sought by other cities and states in developing court services for children and families and she provided similar help to other countries.         She wrote numerous articles and books about the legal and psychiatric problems of dealing with children and families.         During World War II, Judge Polier served as counsel to Eleanor Roosevelt in the Office of Civil Defense in Washington. With Mrs. Roosevelt and others, she helped found the nonsectarian Wiltwyck School for disturbed delinquent children in New York City. Fired for 'Agitating' Workers         Judge Polier was born in Portland, Ore., and her desire to correct social ills showed up early in life. While a sophomore at Radcliffe College, she lived at a settlement house in Boston for underprivileged children. She had also attended Bryn Mawr College.         After transferring to and graduating from Barnard College, she got a job with a woolens mill in Passaic, N.J., from which she was fired for what she later described as ''agitating'' workers who had been forbidden by management to organize.         She studied labor relations in Geneva for a year, then decided to become a lawyer on the advice of her father. He persuaded her to study law, she said years later, ''because I had good intentions but no skills.''         In 1928, she graduated from Yale Law School, where she had married Leon A. Tulin, a professor. He died in 1932. Active in Adoption Issues         After Yale, she served on a state committee to study workers' compensation laws and was an assistant corporation counsel of New York City before she was named a judge.         She was for many years the president of Louise Wise Services, an adoption and child-care agency founded by her mother in 1916.         Judge Polier headed an unofficial citizens commission that in 1974 looked into the alleged paddling of students, at the Jordan L. Mott Junior High School in the Bronx, by two deans. The commission called for an ombudsman, among other measures, to protect pupils against corporal punishment.         Judge Polier was a vice president of the American Jewish Congress and a member of the board, and former president, of the Field Foundation.         Her second husband, Shad Polier, died in 1976. She is survived by two sons, Stephen Wise Tulin of Larchmont, N.Y., and Jonathon Wise Polier of Manhattan; a daughter, Dr. Trudy Festinger of Manhattan; five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
        Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Aileen Barlow Ryan, a former New York City Councilwoman who in 17 years on the Council played a key role in clashes over some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's, died Saturday of heart disease at Long Beach (L.I.) Memorial Hospital. She was 74 years old.         Born in the Clasons Point section of the East Bronx, she held the borough's at-large seat on the Council for more than 17 years. A Democrat, she had been a teacher in the city's school system and had served three and a half terms in the State Legislature before her election to the Council in 1965.         Her political career, which ended in 1983 when the at-large Council seats were abolished, was devoted largely to education and consumer causes. At budget time she often tangled with the Koch administration over what she considered to be meager funds for the public libraries. Author of Food Laws         Her legislative triumphs included the sponsorship of a law to require dairies to place dates on their milk cartons. Another law she sponsored mandated that supermarkets must list unit prices as well as package prices.         As chairwoman of the Council's General Welfare Committee, she was at the center of some of the most heated social issues of the 1970's. She was chairwoman of a series of long public hearings on proposals to require all-male private clubs to admit women.         Her position on measures that sought to guarantee the civil rights of the city's homosexuals was equivocal at times, but her handling of the issue enhanced her reputation as a skilled parliamentarian. In 1978 she scheduled hearings on the rights bill the day after the November election, leading to accusations by proponents of the bill that she had chosen a day when the public and news media would be absorbed in other matters.         On another crucial occasion the bill was stalled in the Welfare Committee when she failed to return from lunch for an important vote, even though supporters of the bill were counting on her vote. Elected to Assembly         Mrs. Ryan went into politics after her husband, E. Gerard Ryan, a lawyer, died. Only a handful of women had served in the New York State Assembly when she was elected to the Legislature in 1958.         She was active in Bronx politics in her 10 years as a teacher, and she was a former vice president of the Siwanoy Democratic Club, now defunct. She was a charter member of the Bronx Historical Society and a member of the League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Ryan was also a member of the Ancient Order of Hibernians, the Business and Professional Women's Club of New York and the Order of Our Lady of the Holy Sepulchre.         Born Aileen Barlow, she attended Public School 47 in the Bronx, Cathederal High School, Hunter College and the New York University Law School. Manhattan College awarded an honorary doctorate to her in 1974.         She was a lifelong resident of the Bronx until she moved to Point Lookout, L.I., about two years ago.         She is survived by two sons, Gerald Ryan of Rockville Centre, L.I., and Francis X. Ryan of Muttontown, L.I.; a daughter, Allana Chesney of Point Lookout, and three grandchildren.         A wake will be held today and tomorrow from 2 to 5 P.M. and from 7 to 9 P.M. at O'Shea's Funeral Home in Wantagh, L.I. A funeral mass is scheduled for 10:30 A.M. Wednesday at St. Helena's Roman Catholic Church in the Bronx.       
        Clara Peller, the diminutive octogenarian who uttered the famous hamburger challenge, ''Where's the beef?'' in television commercials for a fast-food restaurant chain, died here today. She was 86 years old.         Clara Peller, the diminutive octogenarian who uttered the famous hamburger challenge, ''Where's the beef?'' in television commercials for a fast-food restaurant chain, died here today. She was 86 years old.         Mrs. Peller died at her home, said Barbara Zummo at Furth Funeral Direction, which was handling arrangements. The cause of death was not known.         Mrs. Peller, who worked as a manicurist and beautician for 35 years, became a celebrity in 1984 when she appeared in two television commercials for Wendy's International Inc., of Dublin, Ohio. In the commercials Mrs. Peller, who was 4 feet 10 inches tall, played the part of a consumer outraged by the small size of hamburger patties served by other fast-food chains. ''Where's the beef?'' she demanded.         The ''beef'' campaign helped increase Wendy's annual revenue by 31 percent, the chain reported. In 1984, Wendy's had 2,850 restaurants worldwide and annual sales of about $2 billion. The campaign also made Mrs. Peller a television star and led to licensing deals for ''Where's the beef?'' T-shirts, coffee mugs and beach towels. Phrase Picked Up by Mondale The phrase even made it into the 1984 campaign for the Democratic Presidential nomination when Walter F. Mondale used it to suggest a lack of substance in proposals advanced by his chief rival, Gary Hart.         ''If Walter Mondale could have said the line like Clara, he would have been our President,'' said Joe Sedelmaier of Chicago, who directed and produced the commercials.         Mrs. Peller lost her job with Wendy's in 1985 after she did a commercial for Campbell's Prego spaghetti sauce proclaiming: ''I found it. I really found it.'' The fast-food chain contended that the commercial ''infers that Clara found the beef at somewhere other than Wendy's restaurants.''         Mrs. Peller worked for actor's scale, $317.40 a day, on the first Wendy's commercial in January 1984. Her fee for the second commercial, which appeared in September 1984, was not disclosed. Wendy's said she made $500,000 for the ''beef'' commercials, but she denied making that much.         ''I made some money, which is nice for an older person,'' she said, ''but Wendy's made millions because of me.''         Mrs. Peller, who came to the United States from Russia when she was a child, is survived by two daughters and two grandchildren.

Vera Allen, an actress who performed in leading roles on Broadway, in Hollywood and on radio and television, died of heart failure Monday in a retirement home in Croton-on-Hudson, N. Y. Miss Allen, who was active in Actors Equity and was a president of the American Theater Wing, was 89 years old.

        Lucille Mason Rose, a former New York City Deputy Mayor, died after a heart attack Saturday in Brookdale Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.         Lucille Mason Rose, a former New York City Deputy Mayor, died after a heart attack Saturday in Brookdale Hospital. She was 67 years old and lived in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn.         ''A middle-aged energetic woman who thinks she knows where she's going'' is the way Mrs. Rose described herself 10 years ago, shortly before Mayor Abraham D. Beame appointed her a Deputy Mayor. She was the first woman to hold such a job.         Mrs. Rose, whose style reflected her youth in Virginia and Brooklyn, moved through a variety of managerial jobs related to labor.         ''I've gone step by step,'' Mrs. Rose said in 1977. ''They haven't let me skip a step.''         The first step was a job as a fiscal clerk in the Department of Social Services, which in 1949 paid $1,860 a year.         After earning a degree in economics from Brooklyn College in 1963, she was named director of the Bedford-Stuyvesant field office of the city's Department of Labor. Her responsibilities were gradually expanded, and in 1970 Mayor John V. Lindsay named her first deputy commissioner of the city Manpower and Career Development Agency.         In 1972, she became Commissioner of the Department of Employment. While she was in charge of that agency, its budget grew from $55 million to $300 million.         Mrs. Rose was born in Richmond on Sept. 27, 1920. Her family moved to Brooklyn when she was 7 years old, and her mother and father opened the Mason Dining Room at the corner of Fulton Street and Albany Avenue.         After her father died, her mother operated the 12-table restaurant by herself. Mrs. Rose's mother also made dresses in the evening to support the family. ''My mother didn't believe in welfare,'' Mrs. Rose recalled in 1972.         Mrs. Rose often left school to help serve the lunchtime crowd at the restaurant. She attended Public School 3 and was graduated from Girls High School in 1937.         During World War II, she worked as a welder in the construction of the battleship Missouri.         Mrs. Rose was the first woman president of the Catholic Interracial Council. She also held posts in other civic and political organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; the National Democratic Committee; the Salvation Army Advisory Committee, and St. Mary's Hospital. She was recently elected president of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Brooklyn chapter of the Lioness Club.         She is survived by a son, Cornelius.

Emma DeLong Mills, a founder and former president of the Chinatown Planning Council and a leader of Chinese medical, educational and cultural institutions for more than 60 years, died of pneumonia Wednesday at the Southport Manor Convalescent Hospital in Southport, Conn. Miss Mills, who had lived most of her life in Manhattan, was 92 years old.         From 1965 to 1984, Miss Mills was a director and officer of the Chinatown Planning Council, a nonprofit multiservice agency serving New York's growing Chinese community. In 1968 she served as the Council's president.         Her interest in China stemmed from her friendship with Mei-ling Soong, a classmate at Wellesley College, who was later known as Madame Chiang, the wife of Chiang Kai-shek, the late president of Nationalist China.         Miss Mills traveled in China after her graduation from Wellesley in 1917, worked on the editorial staff of the Shanghai Gazette and also tutored in China.         In the 1930's, after the Japanese invasion, she raised funds for the war-torn country. After World War II, she assisted in the education of young Chinese in the United States.         Over the years, she served as an official of the American Bureau for Medical Aid to China, the Hong Kong True Light School Foundation and the American-China Policy Association.         Miss Mills, who was born in Stamford, Conn., was an Army Nurse and a ''farmerette,'' a member of a corps of young women working on farms, in World War I. In World War II she was employed in the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb.         She is survived by a cousin, Thomas A. DeLong of Southport.

        Beatrice Joy Chute, a novelist and short-story writer who was also a past president of the PEN American Center and taught for many years at Barnard College, died of a heart attack Sept. 6 at Bellevue Hospital Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Beatrice Joy Chute, a novelist and short-story writer who was also a past president of the PEN American Center and taught for many years at Barnard College, died of a heart attack Sept. 6 at Bellevue Hospital Center. She was 74 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Chute, who was born in Minneapolis in 1913, published her first story in 1931. She wrote many stories for and about adolescent boys for Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and other magazines during the 1930's, and her first book, ''Blocking Back,'' was published in 1938. Many of her early works, such as ''Shattuck Cadet'' (1940) and ''Camp Hero'' (1942), were realistic tales of sports and camp life that captured the relationships and slang of her primarily male teen-age heroes.         Although she continued to write short stories for children and adolescents in the 1940's, Miss Chute began to concentrate on adult fiction with ''The Fields Are White,'' a 1950 book about marriage and manners.         Her best-known novel, ''Greenwillow'' (1956), was described by a critic as ''a deeply moving, gently humorous and serenely wise'' story of young love and self-discovery. It was made into a Broadway musical in 1960. Subsequent works included a 1957 anthology called ''The Blue Cup and Other Stories,'' ''The Story of a Small Life'' (1971) and ''Katie: An Impertinent Fairy Tale'' (1978). Taught at Barnard         Her most recent novel, ''The Good Woman'' (1986), was a parable about a lonely woman who abandons her home for a journey of spiritual awakening while living on the streets.         Miss Chute - who preferred to be called Joy and signed her books B. J. Chute - moved to New York in the early 1940's with her mother and two sisters. Over the years, she did volunteer work with poor children and the Police Athletic League. She became an adjunct professor of English at Barnard College in 1964, and taught creative writing there until her death.         She was also director of Books Across the Sea, a division of the English-Speaking Union that promoted American books overseas, and was an active member and one-time president of the American chapter of PEN, the writer's association.         Miss Chute is survived by two sisters, Marchette Chute, an author, of Manhattan, and Mary Chute Smith, of Morristown, N.J.         A memorial service will be held at St. Peter's Church, Lexington Avenue and 53d Street, on Oct. 8 at 5:15 P.M.

Antoinette Faissex du Bost Castelli, the president of Castelli Graphics Gallery in Manhattan, died of a hemorrhage yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital, where she was being treated for cancer. She was 58 years old.

In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Jean-Christophe; her mother, Edmee Haviland, and two sisters.       
        Lee Theodore, the Broadway musical choreographer and performer and the founder of the American Dance Machine, died on Thursday in a nursing home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, after a long illness. She was 54 years old.         Lee Theodore, the Broadway musical choreographer and performer and the founder of the American Dance Machine, died on Thursday in a nursing home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx, after a long illness. She was 54 years old.         Mrs. Theodore was the original Anybodys, the tomboy member of the Jets gang, in ''West Side Story'' in 1957. She also appeared in ''Gentlemen Prefer Blondes,'' ''The King and I,'' ''Damn Yankees,'' and ''Tenderloin.'' Her choreographic credits include the Broadway musicals ''Baker Street,'' ''Apple Tree'' and ''Flora, the Red Menace.'' She also choreographed for the television shows of Perry Como, Ed Sullivan, Sid Caesar and Steve Allen.         In 1962, Mrs. Theodore founded the Jazz Ballet Theater, a company commissioned for the International Jazz Festival in Washington by President Kennedy's Music Committee. The major work of her last years was the direction of the American Dance Machine, a theater-dance company she founded in 1975, a company devoted to the preservation of Broadway choreography of the past. An Expression of Culture         One reviewer suggested that theater dance did not belong on the concert stage. Several choreographers resisted the idea initially. ''Some choreographers say they created the dances for a commercial setting and they're not worth saving, because they can't stand up,'' Mrs. Theodore said last year, before a company season at City Center. ''Gower Champion felt that way, but when he saw the company he changed his mind.''         Other choreographers expressing similar doubts at first were Agnes de Mille and Michael Kidd, but Miss de Mille later became an active supporter of the company. Among the dancers assisting with revivals were Gwen Verdon and Helen Gallagher. Mrs. Theodore also envisioned the company as a training facility for show dancers.         ''Theater dance is the way the American dancer expresses his culture, his understanding of the time,'' Mrs. Theodore said in 1978, before the company's first Broadway appearance. ''I had the privilege of working as a dancer and assistant with what I call the masters, people like Jerome Robbins, Danny Daniels, Don Saddler, Jack Cole. But only Bob Fosse has really been active lately. I would be teaching at universities around the country and the kids wouldn't know who Jack Cole or Agnes de Mille were. Their work is a part of our history and I began to feel it would be lost to this generation.'' Prominent in 'West Side Story'         Mrs. Theodore was born in Newark and trained at New York's High School of Performing Arts. Shortly afterward, she made her debut as a dancer in Broadway musicals. She also danced with the Slavenska-Franklin Ballet Company. She made her directorial debut with a 1968 revival of ''West Side Story,'' for which she was chosen by Mr. Robbins, and worked on several later productions of the show.         Mrs. Theodore continued to work until July of this year. Her last ballet, ''Dance Timecapsule,'' will be performed by American Dance Machine next month in New York. ''It is sort of a compendium of everything she had learned,'' her husband, Paris Theodore, said yesterday.         Mrs. Theodore is also survived by her sons, Said and Ali. The funeral will be private. Plans for a memorial service have not been set.

Margot L. Marek, an author and specialist in learning disabilities, died of a brain tumor Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 53 years old and lived in Manhattan and Hillsdale, N.Y.         Mrs. Marek, who was educated at Swarthmore College and Columbia University, was the author of ''Different, Not Dumb,'' a book on learning disabilities that was published in 1985, and ''Matt's Crusade,'' a novel for young adults that is to be published next spring. She also taught children with learning disabilities at her home in Manhattan.         Mrs. Marek is survived by her husband, Richard, who is president and publisher of E. P. Dutton, the book publishing company; a son, Alan; a daughter, Elizabeth; her parents, Maurice and Anita Ravage; a brother, Alan Ravage, and a sister, Susan Herron, all of Manhattan.         A memorial service is to be held at 2 P.M. Friday at Riverside Memorial Chapel, 180 West 76th Street in Manhattan.       
        Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         Clare Booth Luce, whose richly varied career encompassed the editorship of Vanity Fair magazine, the writing of hit Broadway plays and service in Congress and as Ambassador to Rome, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. Mrs. Luce, who was 84 years old, had been gravely ill with cancer for some time.         She was widely known as the sharp-tongued wife of one of the nation's most influential publishers, Henry R. Luce, whose magazines included Time, Life and Sports Illustrated.         But she won fame on her own as magazine writer and editor, author of ''The Women'' and other hit plays, controversial Republican member of the House of Representatives from Connecticut, and, finally, in the Eisenhower Administration, a hardworking and often praised Ambassador to Italy.         She had enough careers to satisfy the ambitions of several women, but none tied her down for long. She was often on lists of the world's 10 most admired women, but her glamorous existence and tart tongue drew criticism, sometimes partisan, sometimes envious.         Clare Boothe was born in New York City on April 10, 1903, the daughter of William Franklin Boothe, a pit orchestra violinist and sometime businessman, and the former Anna Clara Snyder, who had been a chorus girl. The child was christened Ann Clare, but she never used the Ann. When Parents Separated         Her parents separated when Clare was 8 years old. She was brought up in genteel poverty by her mother, who still managed to take her to France for a year and send her to the Cathedral School of St. Mary in Garden City, L.I., and the Castle School at Tarrytown-on-Hudson, N.Y. In 1919, her mother married Dr. Albert Elmer Austin, a prominent physician in Greenwich, Conn. On a trip to Europe in 1920, the 18-year-old Clare met Elsa Maxwell among other social figures. ''I'll have her to one of my parties,'' Miss Maxwell said. ''Whatever happens then, she'll get a rich husband.''         That happened, but not because of a Maxwell party. Clare Boothe met her future husband in church: George Tuttle Brokaw, millionaire-playboy son of a clothing manufacturer.         They married in 1923 in a wedding called ''the most important social event of the season.'' It was not to last. Mr. Brokaw, 23 years older than his bride, was a heavy drinker, according to one of his biographers, and was prone to abuse his wife. After six years of marriage she won a divorce on grounds of mental cruelty and was awarded $425,000 plus education expenses for her daughter, Ann Clare Brokaw. The Job at Vanity Fair         Declining to rest on her money, Clare Boothe importuned a society friend, Conde Nast, publisher of Vogue and Vanity Fair, for a job. After proving she was not another idle society matron whiling away her time between husbands, she did a stint writing photo captions for Vogue.         Vanity Fair's editor, Frank Crowninshield, hired her after demanding that she draw up a list of 100 ideas. She rose quickly to assistant editor and wrote satirical pieces about society that were later collected in a book, ''Stuffed Shirts.''         Her penthouse apartment on East 57th Street, Manhattan, drew the social, artistic and political types who peopled Vanity Fair's pages. She became managing editor, injecting more political material in an effort to revive the magazine. She left in 1934.         She had written three plays, none produced. She once said reading the plays of George Bernard Shaw was the impetus for her interest in the theater. Much later she met Shaw and is said to have gushed, ''Except for you, I wouldn't be here.'' Shaw supposedly replied, ''And now, let me see, dear child, what was your mother's name?''         Her first produced play, ''Abide with Me,'' in 1935, was unanimously deemed a disaster. It concerned a drunken, sadistic husband who is shot in the last act. Several critics commented on how quickly she responded to almost indiscernible cries of ''Author.'' She never went to another opening night. Sparks at First Sight of Luce         Two days after the opening, the author became the wife of Henry R. Luce, publisher of Time and Fortune. The two independent personalities had struck sparks on their first meeting, when they were seated together at a dinner party and Mr. Luce ignored her.         The next time they met, at a party at the Waldorf-Astoria, his future wife resolved to pay Mr. Luce back by asking rude questions. This time he was enthralled by her. He ordered her to accompany him to the Waldorf's lobby, where he said, ''You are the great love of my life, and some day I'm going to marry you.''         The marriage lasted, although there were rumored difficulties - perhaps inevitable in a marriage between two such strongminded personalities. She had her separate careers and Mr. Luce had his magazines - Life, the picture magazine, was reportedly her idea. The Successful Plays         Mrs. Luce returned to writing plays and with ''The Women,'' in 1936, recovered admirably from her maiden flop on Broadway. The play was an apotheosis of feminine bitchiness, concerning a devoted wife, the only sympathetic character, trying to win back her husband, who had been poached by a saleswoman. It earned her $2 million.         In 1938, Mrs. Luce was represented by ''Kiss the Boys Goodbye,'' a satire on the hoopla surrounding the search for the feminine lead in the movie of ''Gone With the Wind.'' It was a box-office success, as was her next play, ''Margin for Error,'' which purveyed a modish anti-Nazism.         With World War II, Mrs. Luce sought to involve herself on a larger stage. In February 1940, she sailed for Europe as an accredited correspondent for Life for a firsthand look at the war. One result was a book, ''Europe in the Spring.'' Dorothy Parker called it ''All Clare on the Western Front.''         In 1943 Mrs. Luce decided to run for the House of Representatives from Fairfield County, Conn. Criticism of Roosevelt         Despite her friendships with early New Dealers, she was by now a Republican and made speeches critical of the Roosevelt Administration's handling of the war effort. Riding an off-year tide of anti-Administration sentiment, she defeated a Democratic incumbent by 7,000 votes.         In her first speech in the House, she attacked a proposal by Vice President Henry A. Wallace calling for postwar freedom of the air. Mrs. Luce wrapped up the Wallace proposal in a single word, ''globaloney.'' In Congress she frequently spoke out on foreign policy as well as for racial equality in the armed forces and war production.         Despite her own brief infatuation with Communism in the 1930's, Mrs. Luce emerged as an early hardline anti-Communist (although as early as 1964 she was calling for more normal relations with China).         She won re-election in 1944, campaigning with fire but concealing sorrow. Her 19-year-old daughter was killed in an automobile accident that year. A Jesuit priest put her in touch with the Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, who was becoming known for his broadcasts. Before Sheen had talked three minutes, she demanded, ''Listen, if God is good, why did He take my daughter?''         ''In order that you might be here in the faith,'' Sheen replied. Became a Catholic         Their sessions, with Mrs. Luce arguing and Sheen explaining, resulted in her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1946. After that a friend noticed a gradual change in her: ''Twenty years ago she was like a diamond - beautiful, brilliant and cold. Now she is beautiful, brilliant and compassionate. She has become a kind and remarkably unselfish woman.''         Because of personal problems and long separations from her husband that her duties entailed, Mrs. Luce did not seek re-election in 1946. She remained politically active, in addition to writing a column for McCall's, and in 1952 she campaigned for Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower.         He offered her the post of Secretary of Labor, but she demurred. He then named her Ambassador to Italy, stirring controversy because of Mrs. Luce's Catholicism, her lack of diplomatic experience and because she was a woman.         But she waded into her job with customary energy and contempt for obstacles. She helped lay the diplomatic groundwork for an international conference that worked out a compromise on the status of Trieste, a dispute that threatened war between Yugoslavia and Italy. Effective Diplomacy         She made strongly anti-Communist speeches and warned of cutoffs of American aid to Italian industry: Communists dominated the labor unions. She drew fire from leftists.  Once her chauffeur misunderstood her directions and took her to the residence of President Giovanni Gronchi. Unable to back out, Mrs. Luce, whose relations with the President had been somewhat strained, took the occasion to persuade him to permit the stationing of American troops on Italian soil.         In Italy she caught a mysterious illness finally diagnosed as arsenic poisoning. The Central Intelligence Agency was called in. The cause was paint dust from her bedroom ceiling. A Controversy Over Brazil         In 1959 she was nominated Ambassador to Brazil. A determined one-man opposition to her appointment was mounted in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee by Senator Wayne Morse of Oregon. Mrs. Luce was confirmed both by the committee and the Senate, but she could not resist a final jab at Morse.         ''My difficulties, of course, go back some years,'' she said, ''when Senator Morse was kicked in the head by a horse.'' (He was once kicked by a horse, but not in the head.) In the resultant furor, Eisenhower defended her while Mr. Luce publicly urged her to resign, which she did.         In 1964 she announced that she was running for the Senate in New York State as a Conservative Party candidate and supporter of Senator Barry Goldwater, whose nomination for President she had seconded at the Republican convention. Under pressure from the party's liberal wing and finally Senator Goldwater himself, she withdrew from the race on the eve of the Conservative convention. Moved to Honolulu         In later years she devoted herself to social life in Phoenix, where the Luces had a house - skindiving, doing mosaics and needlepoint, painting and writing. After Mr. Luce died in 1967, she moved to Honolulu, where she lived until 1983, when she moved into an apartment at the Watergate complex in Washington.''It's a city of human proportions,'' she said.         In recent years Mrs. Luce served on President Reagan's unpaid Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board.         Of her writing she once said, ''I have been too involved with living to write much - or well - about life.'' A biographer, Alden Hatch, summed her up this way:         ''Brilliant, yet often foolish; idealistic, yet realistic to the verge of cynicism; tough as a Marine sergeant, but almost quixotically kind to unfortunates; with the mind and courage of a man and exceedingly feminine instincts; the complexities of her character are as numerous as the facets of her career. Probably the reason no one understands her completely is because she does not even understand herself.''         Mrs. Luce is survived by two stepsons, Henry Luce 3d and Peter Paul Luce. Interment will be private, A High Mass will be offered at noon Tuesday in St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York and a memorial service Wednesday at 11 A. M. at the Church of St. Stephen Martyr in Washington.       
        Eleanor M. Johnson, founder of The Weekly Reader, which has brought the news of the world to schoolchildren for nearly six decades, died of cancer Thursday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. She was 94 years old.         Eleanor M. Johnson, founder of The Weekly Reader, which has brought the news of the world to schoolchildren for nearly six decades, died of cancer Thursday at a nursing home in Gaithersburg, Md. She was 94 years old.         Miss Johnson, a dedicated and energetic educator for half a century, produced the first issue of the newspaper on Sept. 21, 1928, and remained active in planning its contents until 1978, when she was 85.         Originally called My Weekly Reader, the slim periodical, typically four or eight pages an issue, was read by two-thirds of today's American adults when they were in elementary school, according to the publisher, Fields Publications of Middletown, Conn.         With its clear, straightforward prose, The Weekly Reader has explained to generations of American children the compelling events of the day: the Depression, World War II, assassinations, the Vietnam War, civil rights struggles and the Iran hostage crisis. 'They Were Missing Knowledge'         ''Part of Eleanor's genius was she knew how to connect kids to the world,'' said Terry Borton, The Weekly Reader's editor in chief for the last 10 years.         Miss Johnson conceived the idea of a newspaper for elementary school pupils in 1927, when she was an administrator overseeing curriculum in the public schools of York, Pa.         ''In her work with kids,'' Mr. Borton said, ''she noticed most of the reading they did was fairy tales and fantasy, which she felt was fine, but she felt they were missing a knowledge and understanding of the real world, which she thought they would like.''         She proposed the idea to William Blakey, president of American Education Publications, which already published a newspaper for high school students. He agreed. Hoover vs. Smith         The cover article of the first Weekly Reader profiled the two principal candidates in the 1928 Presidential election, Herbert Hoover and Alfred E. Smith, focusing on their childhood. Its headline said, ''Two Poor Boys Who Made Good Are Now Running for the Highest Office in the World.'' The leading articles in two of the most recent Weekly Readers discussed a controversy over cigarette advertisements and the growing concern about air travel.         Circulation reached 100,000 the first year and grew to a high of 13 million in the late 1960's and early 1970's, when The Weekly Reader expanded to seven editions, one for each grade level from preschool to sixth grade. Nine million schoolchildren subscribe today, at a cost of about $2 for the 27 issues of the school year.         All the while, according to the newspaper's publisher, The Weekly Reader has retained its original aim: ''to present selected, well-written news of interest and value to children with accuracy and fairness, colorful but uncolored.'' A Farmer's Daughter         Eleanor Murdock Johnson was born Dec. 10, 1892, in Washington County, Md., a daughter of a farming couple.         Miss Johnson, a fragile-looking woman who stood about 4 feet 10 inches, began her career in education as a first-grade teacher in Oklahoma. She worked as a consultant to The Weekly Reader during its early years while continuing to hold administrative jobs in York and then in the Lakewood, Ohio, school system.         In 1935, she left public schools to preside over the magazine full time as editor in chief, a job she held until 1961. Then, after retirement, she continued to serve the paper as a consultant until 1978.         Miss Johnson, who held master's degrees in education from the University of Chicago and Columbia University, was also a co-author of several children's books, including the Child Story Readers and the Treasury of Literature Readers, and wrote more than 50 elementary school workbooks that offered exercises in reading, arithmetic and geography. She also wrote numerous articles in education journals and was an active public speaker.         Miss Johnson, whose cancer was diagnosed about a month ago, is survived by a sister, Maria Johnson, with whom she lived at the Herman M. Wilson Health Care Center of the Asbury Methodist Retirement Center in Gaithersburg.         A memorial service will be held Monday afternoon at St. Marks Lutheran Church in Wolfsville, Md.

Ione Gaul Walker, a painter, arts patron and former art dealer, died of cancer of the throat on Monday at her home in Provincetown, Mass. She was 72 years old.         Born in Pittsburgh, Mrs. Walker was an art student at the Carnegie Institute of Technology from 1933 to 1934, then moved to New York, where she studied dance with Ruth St. Denis. In 1936 she married Hudson D. Walker, an art historian, and from 1936 to 1940 the two operated the Hudson D. Walker Gallery on 57th Street, where they showed the work of such artists as Marsden Hartley, Mervyn Jules, Joseph Hirsch and Harry Sternberg.         Mrs. Walker exhibited her own paintings at the Bertha Schaefer Gallery in New York and the Provincetown Art Museum. In 1967, she and her husband helped to found the Fine Arts Work Center in Provincetown, which provides fellowships for emerging artists and writers. She was also a founder of the Provincetown Symphony Society and was its president from 1954 to 1958.         Mrs. Walker's husband died in 1976. She is survived by three daughters, Harriet Heron of Medford Lakes, N.J., Berta B. Walker of New York, and Louise W. Walker of Central Middlesex, Mass., and four grandchildren.         A memorial service will be held tomorrow at 3 P.M. at St. Mary's of the Harbor Church in Provincetown.

        Lucy Monroe, who sang ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' at every New York Yankees opening day and every Yankees World Series between 1945 and 1960, died of cancer Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 80 years old.         Lucy Monroe, who sang ''The Star-Spangled Banner'' at every New York Yankees opening day and every Yankees World Series between 1945 and 1960, died of cancer Tuesday at her Manhattan home. She was 80 years old.         Miss Monroe, the official soloist for the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars, spent much of her career singing the national anthem. She once estimated that she had sung it more than 5,000 times. In 1940 she starred in ''The American Jubilee'' at the New York World's Fair, closing each of 650 performances with the anthem. She sang for Presidents Roosevelt, Johnson and Kennedy, at President Truman's inauguration and at hundreds of other civic and patriotic gatherings.         In 1942, she conducted a community sing, sponsored by the Treasury Department, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial. More than 40,000 people attended. During the next four years the Treasury and RCA Victor co-sponsored similar events nationwide to sell war bonds. Anthem Sometimes Barred         On some occasions, however, Miss Monroe refused to sing the song with which she had become so closely identified. When she performed for American troops, she did not sing the national anthem because, she said, ''the men are living it.''         Miss Monroe, who was born on Oct. 23, 1906, in New York, was the daughter of Anna Laughlin and Dwight Monroe, a diamond importer. She was a graduate of the Horace Mann School.         During the 1930's she was featured on three commercial radio programs a week and was a co-star for four years with Frank Munn on NBC's ''American Album of Familiar Music.'' She also appeared as a soloist with the New York Philharmonic and Philadelphia orchestras and with the Chicago, St. Louis and Metropolitan Opera companies.         Miss Monroe married Harold M. Weinberg, a New York lawyer, in 1961, and was widowed in 1977. She leaves no survivors.         A memorial service will be held at 10:30 A.M. Tuesday at St. Bartholomew's Church, Park Avenue between 50th and 51st Streets.

        Kate L. Turabian, author of one of the most widely read stylebooks on dissertations, died yesterday morning in her sleep at a retirement home in Los Angeles. She was 94 years old.         Kate L. Turabian, author of one of the most widely read stylebooks on dissertations, died yesterday morning in her sleep at a retirement home in Los Angeles. She was 94 years old.         Fifty years ago, while she was a secretary at the University of Chicago and did not have a college degree, she wrote a slender pamphlet describing the correct style for writing college dissertations. The pamphlet eventually became a book called ''A Manual for Writers of Term Papers, Theses, and Dissertations'' and it has sold more than five million copies in five editions.         The book is considered a definitive work on items such as the use of footnotes and bibliographies.         She was born Laura Kate Larimore in Chicago on Feb. 26, 1893. After graduating from Hyde Park High School, in Chicago, Mrs. Turabian worked for an advertising agency. She started her career at the University of Chicago in 1925, as a department secretary, and within five years, became a secretary in the registrar's office. Effort to Aid Students         In 1930 the university appT, Oct. 25 (AP) -         United Automobile Workers members overwhelmingly approved a new three-year contract with the General Motors Corporation that protects union jobs while freeing management to seek less restrictive work rules, the union announced tonight.         Members at 152 locals across the country voted 80.7 percent in favor of the agreement, said a union spokesman, Frank Joyce. About half of the union's 330,000 General Motors workers cast ballots, he said.         In all, 127,047 workers voted to approve the contract, and 30,325 voted against it, Mr. Joyce said.         The contract is to take effect Monday.         The union president, Owen Bieber, said the early settlement of contracts with General Motors and the Ford Motor Company will make it easier to organize workers at Japanese-run auto and parts companies.         The agreements forbid layoffs for most reasons except cuts in production volume because of slow sales. and provide for wage increases of 3 percent the first year and 3 percent lump-sum bonuses in the second and third years.         The contracts give local unions six months to work out new work rules and other changes that would increase efficiency and improve quality at individual plants.         General Motors has announced the closing of 16 plants and the elimination of 37,000 jobs by the end of 1990.

Edith Luckett Davis, Nancy Reagan's mother, died of a stroke today at her home in Phoenix, Ariz. She was 91 years old.         President and Mrs. Reagan will travel to Phoenix Tuesday morning, and the President will return to Washington Tuesday night, leaving Mrs. Reagan behind. Mr. Reagan will return to Arizona for the funeral, when arrangements are completed, the White House said.         Mrs. Davis, who went by the name ''Lucky,'' had been in poor health for the last several years. The White House said she died at 12:15 P.M., mountain standard time. Mrs. Reagan was at the White House when told of her mother's death. Career as an Actress         Mrs. Davis began work as an actress at the age of 15 and appeared in several films, including ''The Other Girl'' in 1915. She also acted on stage, in New York and with several regional stock companies. Her last Broadway appearance was in 1928 when she played with Walter Huston and Kay Francis in ''Elmer the Great.''         Her first marriage, to Kenneth Robbins of Pittsfield, Mass., ended in divorce. In 1929 she met and married Dr. Loyal Davis, a Chicago neurosurgeon.         Mrs. Davis performed volunteer work in various areas of health care for more than 50 years. She served on several boards and foundations. She also served as honorary chairman of the women's division of United Cerebral Palsy.         After Dr. Davis retired as head of the surgery department at Northwestern University in 1963, she moved with him to Phoenix. Dr. Davis died in 1982.         In 1983 Mrs. Davis was awarded the Arizona Lifetime Achievement Award by the Association for Retarded Citizens.         She is survived by one daugther, Mrs. Reagan; one son, Richard Davis of Philadelphia, and seven grandchildren.

Marie Kryl, a concert pianist who appeared with the Chicago, Cincinnati and St. Louis Symphony Orchestras, died Sunday in Orlando, Fla. She was 90 years old.         Miss Kryl was born in Philadelphia on July 4, 1897, but lived most of her early life in Chicago, where she studied with the well-known pianist and teacher Rudolph Ganz.         Her father, Bohumir Kryl, a bank president, art collector, composer and bandmaster, so wanted his daughters, Marie and Josephine, to become musicians that, in 1921, he promised them each $100,000 if they would not marry before reaching age 30. They both agreed.         But neither daughter lived up to her vow. Josephine, a violinist of note, married the composer Paul Taylor White before turning 30. Marie forfeited her fortune when, in 1926, she became engaged to a Greek Count, Spiro Hadji-Kyriacos. A year later, however, the engagement was broken, and in 1932, she married Michel Gusikoff, a composer and a former assistant conductor of the Pittsburgh Symphony.
