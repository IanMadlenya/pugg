         Margaret Chase Smith, a flinty, independent Maine Republican who made history as the first woman to win election to both houses of Congress and the first whose name was advanced for the Presidency at a national convention, died yesterday at at her home in Skowhegan, Me. She was 97 years old.         A spokeswoman from the Margaret Chase Smith Library in Skowhegan said she had died of complications from a stroke eight days earlier that had left her in a coma.         A red rose was Mrs. Smith's trademark, a stalwart conscience, her beacon. She was known as the "conscience of the Senate."         In four terms in the House, from 1941 to 1949, then four in the Senate through 1975, Mrs. Smith won friends and earned foes across a wide political spectrum. She could number among her enemies such polar opposites as the Communist-hunting Joseph R. McCarthy and the leader of the Soviet Union, Nikita S. Khrushchev. The formidable Mr. McCarthy referred sneeringly to Mrs. Smith as a "Snow White," and Mr. Khrushchev saw her as "the devil in the disguise of a woman."         Mrs. Smith said her life in politics was her only life. "I have no family, no time-consuming hobbies," she said late in her Senate career. "I have only myself and my job as United States Senator."         But she also had a sense of humor.  In 1952, when asked by a reporter what she would do if she woke up one morning and found herself in the White House, she replied: "I'd go straight to Mrs. Truman and apologize. Then I'd go home."         Though Mrs. Smith seemed to many people a champion of women's rights, she said she did not regard herself as a feminist. "I was treated fairly in the Senate, not because of equal rights but because of seniority," she said in a 1975 interview.         In her dedication to her work, she answered 2,941 consecutive Senate roll-calls, a series broken only when she underwent a hip operation in 1968. In time, she became the ranking Republican on the Armed Services and Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committees, and served as well on the Appropriations Committee.         Never anything but a Republican, Mrs. Smith was hardly the dyed-in-the-wool variety. Party regulars could never take her vote for granted. She voted as she saw fit.         In the 1950's, Mrs. Smith alienated McCarthy by joining with six other Republican senators in making a "declaration of conscience" in which she took the measure of McCarthy's sensationalist, inquisitorial methods in trying to suppress Communism.  "I don't want to see the Republican Party ride to political victory on the four horseman of calumny -- fear, ignorance, bigotry and smear," Mrs. Smith said. McCarthy responded by referring to her and the six other senators as "Snow White and the Six Dwarfs."         Khrushchev was understandably restrained when Mrs. Smith, a consistent advocate of a strong military, criticized President John F. Kennedy because she thought he lacked the will to use nuclear weapons and concluded that such restraint weakened America's struggle against the Soviet Union. When Mr. Khrushchev heard of Mrs. Smith's stance, he said he thought it had beaten "all records of savagery."         But Mrs. Smith replied: "Mr. Khrushchev isn't really mad at me. I am not that important. He is angry because American officials have grown more firm since my speech."         Shortly before his assassination, President Kennedy called Mrs. Smith a "formidable political figure" against whom he would not like to campaign. The morning after his death, she went into the Senate chamber before it convened and laid a red rose on Kennedy's old desk.         As a member of Congress she supported President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal legislation, much to the dismay of her more conservative colleagues. Over the years, she angered fellow Republicans by supporting Federal aid to education in 1948, by voting against Lewis L. Strauss, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's nominee for Secretary of Commerce in 1959, and by opposing President Richard M. Nixon's unsuccessful nominees to the Supreme Court, Clement F. Haynsworth in 1969 and G. Harrold Carswell in 1970.         She was a strong supporter of civil rights and, again irritating some Republican colleagues, an early advocate of Government-financed medical care for the elderly.         Margaret Madeline Chase was born on Dec. 14, 1897, in Skowhegan on the Kennebec River in central Maine. Her father, George Emery Chase, was the town barber and her mother was the former Carrie Murray.         As the eldest of six children in a family of modest means, Margaret was expected to work -- and that she did even as a schoolgirl; she was skillful enough to shave her father's customers when he was busy or away from the shop.         After graduating from Skowhegan High School in 1916, she held jobs for which a college education was not always required: telephone operator, circulation manager for a weekly newspaper, grade-school teacher and eventually a woolen mill executive.         In 1930, at the age of 32, she married Clyde H. Smith, who was 22 years her senior and co-owner of the local newspaper. Mr. Smith, who was prominent in local Republican circles, ran for office and in 1937 was elected Representative from Maine's Second Congressional District.         In 1940, seriously ill after suffering a heart attack, Mr. Smith asked Maine voters to continue his policies by electing his wife to succeed him. After his death, she was chosen to fill his unexpired term in a special election and was elected in her own right later that year.         In 1948 Mrs. Smith entered the Republican senatorial primary and received more votes than her three male opponents combined. In the general election she easily defeated her Democratic rival, Dr. Adrian Scolten.         She said she considered taking her maiden name back after her husband's death, adding: "My name was Chase. It's a good New England name. I liked it. But legally I was Smith."         She quickly grew in stature as a senator and was mentioned as a Vice Presidential candidate in 1952 and again in 1968. In 1964 Mrs. Smith announced her candidacy for President and ran in the New Hampshire primary that year. She drew more than a dozen votes at the Republican National Convention, which was controlled by the conservative forces backing Barry Goldwater.         She seemed unstopable until 1972, when William D. Hathaway, a 48-year-old Democrat and former member of Congress, defeated her in her campaign for a fifth Senate term. She was 74 at the time and seemed increasingly frail, riding the Capitol corridors on a small yellow cart and carrying a cane. There were rumors that her health was fragile, but she remained robust for many years.         In her later years she was no less independent but grew weary and wary of militants.         In 1970, 20 years after she had denounced McCarthy's scare tactics, she said that those on the radical left who advocated violence were easily the equal to the menace she had perceived from the radical right two decades earlier. "We had a national sickness then from which we recovered," she said. "We have a national sickness now from which I pray we will recover."         But, true to form, she also attacked those in the Government who, she believed, had overreacted to the anti-war demonstrators.         Mrs. Smith did not remarry after the death of her husband. She is survived by a sister, Evelyn Williams of Skowhegan, and several nieces and nephews.       
         Dr. Dorothy V. Whipple, who helped to secure the rights of women in the medical profession and advanced the cause of children through her widely influential work in pediatrics, died Friday at her home in Washington. She was 94.         Dr. Whipple was the first married woman admitted to Johns Hopkins Medical School ("They objected on those grounds but finally took me in," she recalled in an interview decades later) and an early advocate of rearing children by using liberal amounts of cuddling and common sense. She graduated in 1929.         "Be natural and easy with your baby," Dr. Whipple wrote in her 1944 book "Our American Babies." In an era when many doctors advocated strict feeding schedules and letting babies cry to exhaustion, Dr. Whipple dared to argue that feeding a baby when it was hungry might be a good idea, and she insisted that love and understanding were what counted: "Nothing we can do or provide for a baby is more important."         As for letting a baby cry on and on, she said, "I found it made a lot of difference to me whose baby was crying."         She was speaking as a mother as well as a professional, a dual role that she played long before it became common. In a 1968 interview, she said it required a sympathetic husband (in her case, the economist Ewan Clague), domestic help and "the constitution of an ox."         Happy to be called "Mrs. Clague" by some friends and neighbors, Dr. Whipple, who grew up in New York City, did not change her name when she married Mr. Clague in 1923, after her graduation from the University of Wisconsin, where she had been a speed skater. She also received a master's degree from Wisconsin before attending Johns Hopkins.         In the New Deal era, Mr. Clague helped organize the Social Security Administration and later served as Commissioner of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In the early 1940's, Dr. Whipple was hired by the Federal Government to revise its popular "Infant Care" pamphlet.         In her revised pamphlet, as in her book and in a syndicated weekly newspaper column on child care, she promoted a nurturing, down-to-earth way with children even as she showed her awareness of common family problems. A grandmother, she wrote, could be a blessing, or "a terrible pain in the neck."         In 1939, Dr. Whipple began a private practice in Arlington, Va., one she continued for 40 years. She was a frequent contributor to professional and popular journals and wrote two other books: "Euthenic Pediatrics" and "Q: Is the Grass Greener? Answers to Questions About Drugs."         The book on drugs was published in 1971 and advocated a more lenient approach to prosecution of marijuana-related crimes because, she argued, criminal sanctions had not stemmed the spread of drug use.         Dr. Whipple's husband died in 1987. She is survived by two sons, Llewellyn Clague of Hastings, N.Y., and Christopher Clague of College Park, Md.; a daughter, Anne Farber of Manhattan; seven grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Ellen Jay Garrison, the widow of the Manhattan attorney Lloyd K. Garrison and a featured performer in the Woody Allen film "Zelig" at the age of 83, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 96.         Mrs. Garrison was born in Boston and attended the Brearley School. She graduated from Bryn Mawr College in 1920. In the 1950's she served as president of Women United for the United Nations. A direct descendant of John Jay, she was a longtime trustee of the John Jay Homestead in Bedford, N.Y.         Her husband was a New York lawyer and civil rights advocate who served on numerous Federal agencies and commissions in the Roosevelt and Truman Administrations and was president of the New York City Board of Education in the mid-1960's. He died in 1991.         Mrs. Garrison, who had never acted, caught the attention of the critics with her performance as Dr. Eudora Fletcher, the eccentric psychiatrist whose younger self was played by Mia Farrow. During the film, she delivers a series of monologues ruminating on her tempestuous relationship with Zelig. She was recommended for the role by a friend who knew the film's casting director.         She is survived by two daughters, Clarinda, of Vierset-Barse, Belgium, and Ellen S. Kean of Weston, Conn.; a son, Lloyd, of Manhattan; 11 grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Roberta Church, an official in the Eisenhower and Nixon Administrations who was the first black woman to be elected to the Tennessee Republican State Executive Committee, died on Saturday at Baptist Memorial Hospital East in Memphis. She was 81 and lived in Memphis.         She had suffered a brief illness, said Ronald A. Walter, the co-author of one of her books.         Miss Church was the last survivor of a family of black Tennesseans who were prominent in business and Republican politics when few Southern blacks were active in either business or the party.         With her aunt, Annette E. Church, she wrote a biography of her grandfather and father, "The Robert R. Churches of Memphis: A Father and Son Who Achieved in Spite of Race" (Burke's, 1974). She also wrote, with Mr. Walter, "Nineteenth-Century Memphis Families of Color, 1850-1900" (Burke's; 2d ed., 1989).         Miss Church, whose full name was Sara Roberta Church, was born in Memphis and received a bachelor's degree and a master's degree from Northwestern University. Her grandfather, Robert R. Sr., founded Memphis's first black bank and was believed to be the first black millionaire in the South.         Her father was an early civil rights leader; in 1916 he formed the Lincoln League to register and organize voters, and in 1917 he founded Tennessee's first chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         He died in 1952 while campaigning for a seat on the Republican State Executive Committee. Miss Church took over the campaign and was elected in his stead to represent Memphis and surrounding Shelby County.         In 1953 she was named by the Eisenhower Administration to promote equal employment opportunities as a Labor Department consultant. In 1961 she started a Civil Service career as an administrator of Federal-state programs in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, later the Department of Health and Human Services. She retired in 1982.         Miss Cook also served two terms under President Richard M. Nixon as a member of his Advisory Council on Adult Education.       
         Alice V. Keliher, whose experiences as a lightly trained teacher of ill-prepared first graders led her to become a renowned expert on early childhood education and a champion of giving children unreserved respect and affection, died on Tuesday at the Tucson Medical Center in Arizona. She was 92.         A longtime professor of education at New York University, Miss Keliher cherished her unofficial title as the "grandmother of day care."         In the 1930's, she conducted seminal research on childhood development with Arnold Gesell at Yale University. In the 1940's and 1950's, as a member of N.Y.U.'s faculty, she served on virtually every city, state and national conference devoted to children and wrote widely on the subject.         And in the 1960's, while winding down her wide-ranging academic career as a professor at Wheelock College in Boston, she became the Massachusetts regional training officer for Head Start, the Federal program designed to provide disadvantaged children with the preschool enrichment Miss Keliher had been preaching to parents and educators for decades.         Although she trained teachers at N.Y.U. from 1936 to 1960, World War II provided her with her major platform.         As director of child and youth services of the New York Office of Civilian Defense, and secretary of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia's Committee on the Wartime Care of Children, Miss Keliher helped make day care an accepted staple of American life.         Her campaign for day care may have made her a legitimate feminist heroine, but Miss Keliher, who also helped lessen the burden on mothers by spearheading the development of kindergarten and nursery school, made it clear that her focus was not women, but their children.         Instead of talking about what "working mothers need," she said in 1949, the emphasis should be on "what makes a good next generation for America."         A native of Washington who received her teacher's certificate after two years of training, Miss Keliher was only 20 when she became a teacher in 1923. After four years in the Washington school system, she decided she could serve children better by teaching their teachers how to teach.         Obtaining bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in three years at Teachers College at Columbia University, she joined Dr. Gesell in 1930. She secured the job with the renowned child psychologist, she later confided, because she was the only applicant who knew how to operate a movie camera, a skill needed in research based on close observation of minute changes in infant behavior.         For all her dedication to her work, Miss Keliher's abiding passion was opera, and for decades she was a fixture in the center of the first row of the first balcony at the Metropolitan Opera (at just over 5 feet tall, she needed an unobstructed view), where her frequent guest was Eleanor Roosevelt.         The two women, who became friends when Mrs. Roosevelt took an apartment in Miss Keliher's building near Washington Square Park, enjoyed trading favors: Mrs. Roosevelt let Miss Keliher take her N.Y.U. students on field trips to the Roosevelt estate at Hyde Park. Miss Keliher, who had the larger oven, let Mrs. Roosevelt roast her turkeys in her kitchen.         Miss Keliher also shared Mrs. Roosevelt's devotion to human rights.         In a little-known chapter of her life, her lawyer, J. Dan O'Neill, said yesterday, Miss Keliher helped several Jewish families escape from Germany and Austria in the late 1930's. Her lawyer said the enterprise was organized by the love of her life, a shadowy American intelligence agent whose death in World War II led Miss Keliher to vow to remain unmarried.         Miss Keliher later created a furor when she refused to attend an education conference at a club known to exclude Jews. And she was such an outspoken champion of women, including their need for birth-control devices, Mr. O'Neill said, that she became a virtual pariah to her own Roman Catholic Church.         For all her books, like "Life and Growth" and "A Critical Study of Homogenous Grouping," Miss Keliher stressed a single theme, one she summed up in 1955: "If I could say just one thing to parents, it would be simply that a child needs someone who believes in him no matter what he does."         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Fay Honey Knopp, an advocate of peace and civil rights who founded a Quaker ministry for men and women in prisons around the country, died on Thursday at her home in Shoreham, Vt. A former resident of Westport, Conn., she was 76.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, her family said in reporting her death this week.         A longtime Quaker minister to prisons, Mrs. Knopp retired two years ago as director of the Safer Society Program, which operates under the auspices of the New York State Council of Churches. The program, a national referral service for sex offenders seeking therapy, grew out of her visits to prison and the Prison Research Education Action Program she founded in 1976.         Under her leadership, an affiliated service, the Safer Society Press, produced about 20 books, research studies, manuals and training videos dealing with the treatment and prevention of sex-related crimes and intended for abusers and their victims.         Her affiliation with the Society of Friends dated to a peace demonstration in 1939. She became a Quaker in 1962 and was designated a "minister of record" to serve as a prison visitor throughout the Federal penitentiary system.         Over the years she also served as director of the New York Region of the American Friends Service Committee, projects director for the National Peace Education Division in Philadelphia and counselor to many conscientious objectors.         Prevention of sexual abuse was a major concern in her nearly 40 years of work with prisoners and, she said, she would be "tough with those guys."         "Society has let them off the hook by just locking them up," she told an interviewer in 1988. "I'm very up front with them. Yes, most of them were sexually abused as children, but that can't be an excuse to go out and abuse other people."         A native of Bridgeport, Conn., she studied at the Hartford Art School, the New School for Social Research and the University of California at Los Angeles.         She is survived by her husband of 54 years, Burton; a daughter, Prof. Sari Biklen of Syracuse; a son, State Representative Alex Knopp of Norwalk, Conn.; two sisters, Isabelle Yolen and Sylvia Wittenberg, both of Laguna Beach, Calif.; a brother, Leonard Irving of Fairfield, Conn., and four grandchildren.       
         Honeychile Wilder is dead, and if the "21" Club is not in actual mourning, the venerable former speak-easy on West 52d Street was closed for vacation last week when word got around that one of its most memorable former patrons had died on Aug. 11 at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         Her original name was Patricia Wilder, and at her death at the age of 76, she was officially known as Princess Alexander Hohenlohe. But from the moment she hit town in the 1930's and took New York by storm, the woman from Georgia who called everybody Honeychile was never called anything but that herself.         Even after she married the Austrian prince and became a celebrated international hostess, she was known as Princess Honeychile.         By her own account, within a day of her arrival in New York in 1934 she had been hired as a showgirl and was appearing with Bob Hope at the Palace Theater.         The gig led to a lifelong friendship, a number of appearances on the Bob Hope radio show, some forgettable movie roles, a series of unforgettable encounters at New York nightclubs and eventually to a series of celebrated liaisons, including a dalliance with King Farouk.         "She was a character," said her friend, Susie Schneider, who reported that the Princess, a longtime resident of Marbella, Spain, had died of lymphoma.         She may not have been the actual prototype of Truman Capote's "Breakfast at Tiffany's" heroine, Holly Golightly, as some said. If she was not, it was probably because Mr. Capote was only 16 years old in 1941 when Miss Wilder was charging New York night life with her special brand of electricity.         There was hardly a night the slender dark-haired beauty with the affecting Southern drawl couldn't be found at the Colony or the Monte Carlo for dinner, followed by stops at the Stork Club, the Cafe Pierre and El Morocco, and she had lunch at "21" so often that the bartender created a Honeychile drink in her honor (a whiskey sour made with honey rather than sugar).         As she later recalled those halcyon days, Conde Nast would send his limousine to take her to black-tie dinners at his town house; George Gershwin asked her to sit next to him at the piano while he was composing Porgy and Bess, and she used to go bar-hopping with Walter Winchell and his pal J. Edgar Hoover.         She had a well-chronicled affinity for millionaires, one that would probably have raised fewer eyebrows if their wives had been more understanding. One who apparently was not was Beverly Paterno, whose husband was the heir to a real estate fortune, calculated at the time as worth 63 million 1941 dollars.         What was said between the two women at the Cafe Pierre on the night of Feb. 22, 1941, was not recorded, but Honeychile's riposte made headlines the next day: she peppered her rival with a flurry of rights and lefts, then doused her with a pitcher of water.         Although she said she had attended a finishing school in Charlottesville, Va., there was some evidence that it did not ruin her speech patterns. As she once told an interviewer, "Everybody was my friend, but I wasn't in love with nobody."         That apparently changed when she met Prince Alexander. The Prince died 11 years ago.         After her husband's death, the Princess, who lived in a small house in Marbella (where a wealthy Hohenlohe cousin owns the Marbella Club) spent much of her time visiting rich friends around the world.         She is survived by a brother, Henry Wilder, of Macon, Ga.       
         Brigid Brophy, a novelist, critic, essayist and crusader for myriad causes ranging from better royalty payments for writers to better treatment for animals, died on Monday at a nursing home in Lincolnshire, England. She was 66 and had been suffering from multiple sclerosis for many years.         Miss Brophy was the author of 4 plays, 7 novels and 14 other books, but she is just as well known for her most successful campaign, for lending rights for authors. In 1979, her efforts resulted in a law that for the first time allowed authors to receive royalty payments from the British Government every time their books were checked out of a public library.         But Miss Brophy also campaigned -- even from her sickbed -- for the rights of women, of prisoners and of animals. She was a vice president of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, and no animal escaped her sympathy. She even became active in an anti-angling campaign, and at one point sent a letter to the fishing correspondent of The Daily Telegraph in which she compared anglers to "thugs who beat up old-age pensioners for fun" and quoted Lord Byron's remark that fishing was "the stupidest of pretended sports."         Brigid Antonia Brophy was born in 1929 in London, the only daughter of the Anglo-Irish novelist John Brophy. She was educated at St. Paul's Girls' School and later at Oxford, where she excelled as a scholar but was soon expelled because of drunken, raucous behavior. She was acting, she later wrote, "in the belief that I had more to learn by pursuing my personal life than from textual emendation, with the result that the authorities could put up with me for only just over a year.         "I came down at the age of 19 without a degree and with a consequent sense of nudity which I have never quite overcome."         In 1954, before she was even 30, she burst onto the literary scene when her novel "Hackenfeller's Ape," about an ape at the London Zoo and its increasingly close relationship to the professor observing its mating habits, won the Cheltenham Literary Festival First Prize for a first novel. Her novels are known for their imagination and acerbic wit, and include "The Snow Ball," in which the characters attend a ball dressed as figures from "Don Giovanni"; "Flesh," which she described as "an almost distressingly cold-blooded little story," and "In Transit," set, claustrophobically, in an airport transit lounge.         But she also developed a reputation as a sharp thinker and fierce intellectual who liked a good fight, and her nonfiction books tended to have provocative, often mischievous points of view. In 1967, for instance, she was one of the authors of "Fifty Works of English Literature We Could Do Without," an attack on a number of classic books including "Jane Eyre," which was likened by the authors to "gobbling a jar-full of school-girl stick-jaw." She also championed the writing of Ronald Firbank in "Prancing Novelist" (1973), subtitled "A Defense of Fiction in the Form of a Critical Biography in Praise of Ronald Firbank."         Miss Brophy, who spoke freely in her early years about her bisexuality and often referred to marriage as "an immoral institution," nonetheless married in 1954. Her husband, the art historian Michael Levey, shared her delight in literature and the arts. He became director of the National Gallery in 1973 and was knighted eight years later.         In a tribute to Miss Brophy in The Independent on Tuesday, her literary agent, Giles Gordon, described her as a "deeply shy, courteous woman" who wrote delightful thank-you letters and kept to rigorous standards in her work. "Woe betide the 'editor' who tried to rewrite her fastidious, logical, exact prose, change a colon to a semi-colon (or vice-versa), or try to spell 'show' other than 'shew,' slavish Shavian that Brophy was," Mr. Gordon wrote.         In 1979, Miss Brophy's physical problem was diagnosed as multiple sclerosis, which steadily worsened until she was housebound and had to use a wheelchair. She remained at home, looked after by paid companions, friends and her husband, who in 1987 quit his job to help care for her. But she continued to work with all the energy her illness would allow. In 1987 she published "Baroque 'n' Roll," a collection of essays in which she outlined, with lucidity and detail, the debilitating toll her condition had taken on her. Eventually, her condition deteriorated so badly that she had to move into the nursing home where she died.         She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Kate.       
         Harriet Bell, a polio survivor and advocate of handicapped rights who directed the Polio Information Center from her bedroom as a resource center for the country's 250,000 polio victims, died last Sunday at her home on Roosevelt Island. She was 72.         The cause was cardiac arrest, Cathie Bell, one of her daughters, said.         Crippled by polio in 1954 at the age of 31, Ms. Bell spent the next 25 years living at Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island, where she helped to raise her three children. As president of the community board of the hospital, Ms. Bell helped to write its patient's bill of rights.         In 1982, she received an award for her work on behalf of patients' rights from the Wonder Woman Foundation, an organization that gives grants to accomplished women over 40. In 1985, she became a co-founder of the Polio Information Center, creating the largest international data base available about the disease. She published the center's newsletter.         Ms. Bell is survived by her three children, Cathie, of Manhattan, and Lori and Douglas, both of Staten Island, and seven grandchildren.       
         Annie Elizabeth (Bessie) Delany, the younger of the two sisters whose wisdom and triumphs have been celebrated in a best-selling book and in the Broadway play "Having Our Say," died yesterday at her home in Mt. Vernon, N.Y. She was 104.         "She just took a couple of deep breaths and passed away," said Amy Hill Hearth, co-author of "Having Our Say: The Delany Sisters' First 100 years," the 1993 best-selling oral history. "And it's an important thing she died at home, in her bed, with her sister there. That's all she wanted."         Her 106-year-old sister, Sarah, known as Sadie, with whom she had lived for more than 100 years, seemed to handle her sister's death with the same strength that had carried her through a century.         "I'll just do the best I can," Sarah Delany told Ms. Hearth in an interview at her home. "I'll continue right on as if Bessie were here."         She added that for her sister, whose life was filled with many achievements, the last few years had been particularly special. "Bessie lived to be 104, and she lived her life the way she wanted to," she said. "And especially the last couple of years, she has been having a ball. Between the play and books, she has been having the time of her life. And she said you really couldn't ask for anything more."         The two sisters had lived so long and seen so much that to some it seemed they might live forever. Born a generation after the Civil War, they had triumphed over Jim Crow, worked in Harlem during its renaissance, borne witness to the feminist and civil rights movements and in recent years, become national celebrities.         Their award-winning memoir has been on the New York Times best-seller list for 19 months, sold more than 900,000 copies and been translated into four foreign languages. They were co-authors of a second book, "The Delany Sisters' Book of Everyday Wisdom" (Kodansha America, 1994) which has sold 160,000 copies. And in April their Mt. Vernon parlor was re-created on Broadway, in a dramatization that earned three Tony nominations.         Bessie Delany often marveled that the nation would be interested in what two elderly black women had to say. She wanted her life seen not so much as a story of blacks or of women, but of America.         The sisters' lives remained simple despite their celebrity. They rose early to eat a breakfast of oatmeal, went to bed after watching the MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour on a black-and-white television and had no telephone. They relied mostly on each other for comfort and company. In more than a century, they lived apart for only a few months. And Sarah Delany said many times that it was for her baby sister that she had lived so long.         Annie Elizabeth Delany was born on Sept. 3, 1891, in Raleigh, N.C., the third child of a former slave who became the country's first black Episcopal bishop. Raised on the campus of St. Augustine's College, she and her siblings were well-educated, nurtured and sheltered from the harsher edges of American racism.         But she and her sister often spoke of the first time they were told to go to the back of the trolley car. And they remembered how the staff at the drugstore refused to serve them. Still, Bessie Delany was undaunted. Known as the feistier of the sisters, she was once almost lynched for speaking rudely to a "rebby boy." And she often told tales of how as a child she would sneak a sip from the forbidden side of the water fountain. 'I'd just take a drink of the white water," she said. "It didn't taste any different."         She graduated from St. Augustine's in 1911 and worked as a teacher in North Carolina and Georgia to earn the money she needed to continue her education. The few months in 1912 that she and Sadie taught in different parts of the South was the only time they did not live together.         In 1917, the two sisters made their way to New York City. Bessie had planned to become a doctor but ultimately decided to go to dental school. She graduated from Columbia University in 1923 and became the second black woman to work as a dentist in New York.         Known as "Dr. Bessie, Harlem's colored woman dentist," Dr. Delany socialized with Cab Calloway, W. E. B. Du Bois and the doyennes of the Harlem Renaissance. But she treated many of Harlem's poor, and in 27 years of practice never raised her rates. It was $2 for a cleaning and $5 for a silver filling, from 1923 until the day she retired, in 1950.         Like her sister Sarah, the first black home economics teacher in a New York City high school, she never married or had children. They referred to themselves as "Negro maiden ladies" and lived together in a Harlem apartment, in a Bronx cottage and finally in the Mt. Vernon home they bought in 1957.         With the death of their youngest sister, Laura, in 1993, they were the last survivors among their parents' children. When asked in a 1993 interview if she could account for her and her sister's longevity, Dr. Delany replied, "Honey, we never married; we never had husbands to worry us to death." As for mortality, she said, "I haven't been afraid to live, and I won't be afraid to die."         Recently Dr. Delany had become more frail, Ms. Hearth said. And in the time the two women knew each other, she often spoke about death, though with characteristic sass and humor. "She was worried she was too mean to get into heaven," Ms. Hearth remembered, laughing.         A funeral service is to be held on Thursday at 10:30 A.M. at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan. And before the curtain rises on "Having Our Say" tonight, there will be a brief tribute at the Booth Theater.         In addition to her sister, Dr. Delany is survived by 14 nieces and nephews.       
         Mary M. Kaufman, a retired lawyer whose practice included cases involving Communism and Nazism, as well as defending the poor, died on Thursday at the Roosevelt division of the St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 82 and lived on the West Side of Manhattan.         Mrs. Kaufman retired about 1980, after having worked in Manhattan for almost all her career. Some of her other cases involved antiwar activities. She practiced mainly without partners.         In 1951, she was in a Federal courtroom as a defense lawyer when Dashiell Hammett, the writer, and W. Alphaeus Hunton, secretary of the Council on African Affairs, were convicted of criminal contempt and sentenced to six months in prison.         She asked Judge Sylvester Ryan to release Mr. Hunton in her custody or set bail, but he refused.         Judge Ryan had found Mr. Hammett and Mr. Hunton guilty for refusing to name contributors to the bail fund of the Civil Rights Congress, which the Attorney General had designated as a Communist subversive front. Mrs. Kaufman's clients included the bail fund as well as Mr. Hunton.         In the preceding two years, the civil rights group had posted $500,000 or more bail for Communists accused of criminal conspiracy or involved in deportation cases, and it had forfeited more than $100,000 because of bail jumping.         In the 1940's, Mrs. Kaufman worked for the National War Labor and Wage Stabilization Boards, and she was a prosecutor at a war-crimes trial in Nuremberg.         She was born Mary Metlay in Atlanta, but grew up mainly in Brooklyn. After graduating from Brooklyn College, she received her law degree from St. John's University and was admitted to the bar in 1937. She became an original member of the National Lawyers Guild in that year.         Her marriage to Frederick Kaufman ended in divorce. Her second husband, Paul Albert, died last year.         Surviving are a son, Michael, of Beacon Falls, Conn.; two stepdaughters, Janice Albert of Rome and Marilyn Albert of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.       
         Linda Goodman, whose down-to-earth insights into character traits were credited with bringing astrology out of the occult section and onto the best-seller lists with the 1968 publication of "Sun Signs," died on Saturday at Penrose Hospital in Colorado Springs. She was about 70 and lived in Cripple Creek.         The hospital said the cause was complications of diabetes.         It may have been "the dawning of the age of Aquarius," as the 1960's song put it, but until Mrs. Goodman, a one-time newspaper reporter and sometime radio writer who had picked up an interest in astrology from grocery store booklets, sat down at her typewriter, the rays had not caused a blink in the publishing industry.         Within months after an obscure house named Taplinger brought out "Sun Signs," in 1968, it had become the first book on astrology to make The New York Times Best-Seller List.         Since then, her agent, Arthur Klebanoff, said yesterday, "Sun Signs," and two follow-up volumes, "Love Signs," (1978) and "Star Signs," (1988) have sold more than 30 million copies in 15 languages and continue to sell some 200,000 copies a year.         The $2.3 million paid for the paperback rights to "Love Signs" set an industry record.         What set Mrs. Goodman's books apart was a combination of her sharp insights and her elegant, accessible style.         Writing in the first person and drawing on the lives of celebrities, historical figures and personal friends to illustrate her points, Mrs. Goodman sometimes seemed more psychologist than astrologer.         Whether your sweetheart's streak of, say, stubbornness, came from the stars or childhood experiences, Mrs. Goodman was a master in elaborating how it would play out against your own tendencies as a dreamer.         Mrs. Goodman, whose original name was Mary Alice Kemery, was born in Morgantown, W. Va., on a date she gave as April 19 in a year she would never disclose.         "I once asked my grandfather, and he wouldn't tell me either," her son Michael Goodman said yesterday. During an interview a few years ago, Mrs. Goodman was more forthcoming, putting her age "between 435 and 450."         The date made her a triple Aries, and Mrs. Goodman, a five-foot-or-so dynamo fit the astrological profile to a T. "She was pushy," her son said.         A writer since childhood, Mrs. Goodman worked as an itinerant newspaper reporter, radio writer and occasional broadcaster. After reading "Letters from Linda" on a radio program, her son said, she adopted the name Linda.         Mrs. Goodman, whose early marriage to William Snyder ended in divorce, began writing "Sun Signs" in New York after an announcing job that had been promised her second husband, Sam Goodman, fell through.         Although her astrology has been called textbook as opposed to mystical, Mrs. Goodman developed a distinct mystic streak. "Star Signs," for example, draws on both numerology and reincarnation.         And when the New York authorities ruled that her 18-year-old daughter, Sarah Snyder, had committed suicide in 1973, Mrs. Goodman, citing her daughter's astrological chart among other evidence, refused to believe that the body identified by her husband was Sarah's.         She later spent so much time trying to find her daughter that she was forever running out of money, at one point living for several months on the steps of St. Patrick's Cathedral.         In addition to her son Michael, who is a resident of Keaau, Hawaii, she is survived by another son, William Snyder of Colorado Springs; a daughter, Jill Goodman, of Manchester, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Johnnie Tillmon Blackston, who encountered one officious welfare inspector too many and used her anger to help change the system, died on Wednesday at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 69.         Her family said the cause was diabetes.         Mrs. Blackston turned her rage over the indignities of a belittling system into a grass-roots movement that won widespread changes and helped make the plight of welfare mothers a feminist issue. And if she did nothing else, she proved that a single mother on welfare can be a woman to be reckoned with.         A sharecropper's daughter who was born in Scott, Ark., and never made it through high school, Mrs. Blackston was accustomed to running her own life. When things went bad in Arkansas, for example, she packed up her children, left her first husband behind and struck out for California in search of a better life.         Mrs. Blackston, who worked in a Los Angeles laundry to support her six children, was not prepared for what she had to endure when she eventually went on welfare, and the system was not prepared for her.         It was the early 1960's, a time, she soon found, when welfare inspectors routinely poked through recipients' refrigerators, demanded to know where they had got the money to buy television sets and staged midnight raids to make sure  they were not harboring men, a violation of the rules for women receiving Aid to Families With Dependent Children.         When Mrs. Blackston, who had been a union shop steward, took offense at such  invasions of privacy, she sat down and sent anonymous letters to her neighbors at a Watts housing project, asking those on welfare to come to a protest meeting. More than 300 people showed up.         Within months in 1963, Mrs. Blackston and her friends founded Aid to Needy Children-Mothers Anonymous, linked up with other state groups and inspired the creation of the National Welfare Rights Organization. Over the next several years it successfully campaigned for improvements, removing many of the system's paternalistic trappings and establishing welfare as an enforceable right.         Along the way, Mrs. Blackston not only shaped the national welfare debate, but also changed the very terms of the argument, transforming what had been a concern far down the agenda of the civil rights movement into a compelling feminist issue.         Noting that the vast majority of welfare recipients were women and children and likening welfare to a "supersexist marriage," Mrs. Blackston was unsparing in her analysis in addresses to welfare mothers. As she once put it:         "You trade in 'a' man for 'The' Man. But you can't divorce him if he treats you bad. He can divorce you, of course -- cut you off -- any time he wants. But  in that case, 'he' keeps the kids, not you.         " 'The' Man runs everything. In ordinary marriage, sex is supposed to be for  your husband. On A.F.D.C. you're not supposed to have sex at all. You give up control of your body. It's a condition of aid. 'The' Man, the welfare system, controls your money. 'He' tells you what to buy and what not to buy, where to buy it and what things cost."         After serving as the national organization's executive director until a lack  of money forced it to close the Washington office in 1974, Mrs. Blackston returned to California, where she worked as a legislative aid and served on state and local committees concerned with welfare.         She is survived by her second husband, Harvey Blackston; six children, Marcia Evans of Riverside, Calif., Ronald, Auluavance, Josalyn and Tanya Tillmon of Los Angeles, and Caffie Tillmon of Stockton, Calif.; 20 grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Florence Greenberg, a one-time New Jersey housewife who parlayed an unlikely  hit record by a teen-age group known as the Shirelles into an improbable career  as the proprietor of a leading independent label of the 1960's, died on Thursday at the Hackensack University Medical Center. She was 82, and lived in Teaneck, N.J.         As a pioneering woman in the male-dominated world of rhythm-and-blues, Mrs. Greenberg was, by her own later account, a triple anomaly: "a white woman who was in a black business and who couldn't carry a tune."         Maybe so, but she had a finely tuned ear for popular music, a keen eye for talent and a driving ambition, all of which became increasingly apparent in the  1960's.         In addition to a series of hits by the Shirelles, among them "Dedicated to the One I Love," "Tonight's the Night," and Mrs. Greenberg's own composition, "Soldier Boy," her Scepter label produced such 1960's standards as "Louie, Louie," by the Kingsmen; "Twist and Shout," by the Isley Brothers, and "Walk on  By," by Dionne Warwick, not to mention "Raindrops Keep Fallin' on My Head," the  Burt Bacharach-Hal David song, sung by B. J. Thomas on the soundtrack of "Butch  Cassidy and the Sundance Kid," which won an Academy Award in 1969.         Mrs. Greenberg traced her success to a day in 1957 when her 16-year-old daughter, Mary Jane, came home raving about the performance of four classmates at a Passaic High School assembly.         Their names were Shirley Alston, Addie Harris, Doris Kenner and Beverly Lee,  but they called themselves the Shirelles, and as soon as Mrs. Greenberg persuaded them to sing for her, she knew that their song, "I Met Him on a Sunday," had the makings of a hit.         A former Republican campaign worker who had translated her political skills into a job peddling songs for a local songwriters, Mrs. Greenberg, who had been  married to an accountant, had already become a familiar figure on Tin Pan Alley, hobnobbing with music-industry hopefuls at the old Turf restaurant on Broadway at 51st Street. She had also joined with two partners to form a label, Tiara Records.         The Tiara release of "I Met Him on a Sunday" was such an immediate success. Within months, Mrs.  Greenberg climbed so many radio-station stairs, sold so many records from the trunk of her car and created such demand that her company  could not handle the orders. So she sold the Shirelles' contract to Decca, an industry giant.         That might have been the end of her career, but, Decca, convinced that the Shirelles would be a one-hit phenomenon, returned the group to Mrs. Greenberg, who formed Scepter to replace Tiara.         Over the next decade, Scepter became an industry sensation as Mrs. Greenberg, whose company eventually occupied an entire floor of 1650 Broadway, repeatedly demonstrated her sure sense of talent.         This was never more evident than the day in 1962 when Mr. Bacharach played a  demonstration record of one of his songs for Mrs. Greenberg, and she told him that while she did not like the song she loved the singer.         The next day, Mr. Bacharach returned, saying he had a signed contract with the singer, a young woman named Dionne Warwick.         Partly because of the long line of hit Warwick releases that followed, Gulf & Western offered $6 million for Scepter in 1965, but Mrs. Greenberg declined to sell.         It was, she later said, a major mistake. Within a decade, as major labels came to dominate the distribution network, Scepter's success had faded, and by the time the company folded in 1977 Mrs. Greenberg had lost everything.         In recent years, Mrs. Greenberg had been cheered by Bette Midler's plans to make a movie of her life, but because Ms. Midler has been unable to secure the required rights from two of the three surviving Shirelles (Ms. Harris died in 1982), the project is dormant.         She is survived by her daughter, Mary Jane Goff of Upper Saddle River, N.J.;  a son, Stanley, of Los Angeles; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Toni Cade Bambara, a writer and documentary film maker who was celebrated for her intricate use of Black English in fiction, died on Saturday at a hospital in Philadelphia. She was 56 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Karma Bene Bambara of Philadelphia.         In the early 1970's, Ms. Bambara was a major contributor to the emerging genre of contemporary black women's literature, along with the writers Toni Morrison and Alice Walker and others. Many of her stories focused on men and women living in black neighborhoods in big cities or small Southern towns -- as  one reviewer put it, "young women and men who formed their political convictions in the fury of the 60's and find themselves gasping for air in the torpor of the 70's, manicurists, singers and students struggling to trim the rhetoric of their wishes to the smaller, tighter fit of reality."         What critics found most striking about Ms. Bambara's fiction, though, were the structure and language she used. Rather than using traditional linear plots, she would often use flashbacks, stream of consciousness and interweavings of plot and subplot to tell a story. She would frequently weave black dialects into her prose, creating a unique, complex language that was widely admired by critics.         Ms. Bambara published one novel, "The Salt Eaters," in 1980. She also edited  several anthologies and wrote several short-story collections, including "Gorilla, My Love," published in 1972, and "The Sea Birds Are Still Alive," published in 1977. Reviewing "Gorilla, My Love" for The New York Times in 1972,  C.D.B. Bryan wrote that her stories were unusual because they addressed racial issues in a tone more thoughtful than angry.         "Toni Cade Bambara tells me more about being black through her quiet, proud,  silly, tender, hip, acute, loving stories than any amount of literary polemicizing could hope to do," Mr. Bryan wrote in the review. "She writes about love: a love for one's family, one's friends, one's race, one's neighborhood, and it is the sort of love that comes with maturity and inner peace."         Ms. Bambara was born in New York City, and growing up, she spent much of her  time in public libraries. Louis Massiah, a friend and colleague in Philadelphia, said that as a child, Ms. Bambara would often visit a Harlem branch of the New York Public Library, where she was inspired by two black poets: Gwendolyn Brooks, whose photograph hung there, and Langston Hughes, who she said would often come and talk to children there.         Ms. Bambara graduated from Queens College with a bachelor's degree in theater arts in 1959. In 1965, she received a master's degree in American studies from the City College of New York. She was an assistant professor of English at Rutgers University from 1969 to 1974, and she also held various teaching positions at Duke University, Atlanta University and Spelman College, among others.         From 1986 until this year, Ms. Bambara taught script writing at Scribe Video  Center in Philadelphia. Mr. Massiah said that during her tenure at the center, she helped start the careers of several black women film makers. She wrote and lectured frequently about film, stressing the importance of movies that dispel Hollywood stereotypes about blacks.         Over the last decade, Ms. Bambara also collaborated with Mr. Massiah on several television documentaries, including "The Bombing of Osage Avenue," about the police assault on Move headquarters in Philadelphia, and a biography of Cecil B. Moore, a prominent civil rights activist in Philadelphia. Her most recent project was a documentary about the life of W.E.B. Du Bois, which she worked on with Mr. Massiah and several others.         Throughout her life, Mr. Massiah said, Ms. Bambara fought for the rights of minorities, women, children and the homeless.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her mother, Helen Brehon of Queens, and a brother, Walter Cade of Queens.       
         Libby E. Sachar, who in 1946 was the first woman appointed a Superior Court judge in New Jersey, died on Dec. 28 at her home in Plainfield, N.J. She was 90.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her son, Judge Leonard Sachar of Scotch Plains, N.J.         Selected as a juvenile-domestic relations judge by Gov. Walter Edge and reappointed in 1951, she served in Union County for 10 years until she resumed her private law practice in Plainfield.         She was a 1924 graduate of the New York University School of Law and was an advocate of women's rights. In 1947, she was a member of the New Jersey Constitution Committee, which revised the state's Constitution.         In addition to her son, who is on the Superior Court bench in Union County, she is survived by a daughter, Naomi Margolies of Plainfield; a brother, Dr. Morton Bertin of Orlando, Fla., six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Kay Brown Barrett, who bought "Gone With the Wind" for the movie producer David O. Selznick after discovering the novel as his New York representative, died yesterday at the Meadow Lakes retirement community in Hightstown, N.J., where she had lived for the last 14 years. She was 93.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter Laurinda Barrett.         In 1986, on the 50th anniversary of the sale of Margaret Mitchell's novel to the movies, Mrs. Barrett recalled that when she told Mr. Selznick she thought the book was "absolutely wonderful," he replied, "A Civil War story won't go."         But when Mr. Selznick's financial backer, John Hay (Jock) Whitney agreed to buy the rights even if Mr. Selznick was not interested in the property, Mr. Selznick changed his attitude. And, Mrs. Barrett noted, "when he did buy it, he made a wonderful, wonderful picture."         Securing "Gone With the Wind" was far from Mrs. Barrett's sole triumph. In a long career as representative, talent scout and powerful agent with Leland Hayward, MCA and ICM, she brought other novels, like Edna Ferber's "Cimarron" and Daphne du Maurier's "Rebecca," to the attention of her employers. She also persuaded Ingrid Bergman to leave Stockholm for Hollywood; signed Laurence Olivier to his first American contract, and coaxed Alfred Hitchcock into signing with the Selznick studio.         She represented Alec Guinness, John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson, Rex Harrison, Fredric March, Patricia Neal and Montgomery Clift. Her clients also included Lillian Hellman, Isak Dinesen and, for 40 years, Arthur Miller. Mrs. Barrett retired when she was 80.         A daughter of Kate Ross and Henry Collins Brown, a founder of the Museum of the City of New York, Kay Brown was born in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y. In 1924, she graduated from Wellesley College, where she majored in English and was active in the dramatic society.         Her first job after graduation was as a girl Friday in the Mary Arden Theater School in Peterborough, N.H. When Joseph P. Kennedy and the school's other owners, the Guy Curriers of Boston, bought a motion-picture company, they offered her a job and put her to work reading stories to find properties. The company, called the File Booking Offices, was renamed RKO. Her first major find for the company was "Cimarron," which brought the studio an Academy Award in 1931.         Mrs. Brown's husband, James Barrett, died in 1967.         In addition to her daughter Laurinda, of Manhattan, she is survived by another daughter, Kate Barrett of Greensboro, N.C.       
         Crosby Newell Bonsall, the author and illustrator of more than 40 children's books, died on Jan. 10 at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, where she lived. She was 74.         The cause was a stroke, said Barbara Phillips, her niece.         Ms. Bonsall began her career at an advertising agency, where she sold the rights to one of her drawings to a doll manufacturer. She then created a family of dolls, which were used as characters in her first book, "Tell Me Some More," which was published in 1961.         Although she began as an illustrator, she quickly turned to writing.  "Tell Me Some More," illustrated by Fritz Siebel, was published by Harper & Row as part of its I Can Read series, which is still in print. She wrote the text for the photographer Ylla's "I'll Show You Cats" (1964), an award-winning children's book.         She was born in Kew Gardens, Queens, and studied at the New York University School of Architecture and the American School of Design.         In addition to Ms. Phillips of Paterson, N.J., she is survived by her husband, George, and a sister, Marion Phillips of Manahawkin, N.J.       
         Sister Ann Gillen, executive director of the Interreligious Task Force on Soviet Jewry from 1972 to 1987, died on Jan. 14 at the Sisters of the Holy Child Jesus convent in Rosemont, Pa. She was 76.         The cause was cancer, said Sister Gloria Coleman, a member of the order.         As the leader of the Interreligious Task Force, which was established in 1972 to press the Soviet Union to let Jews emigrate without restrictions, Sister Ann picketed Soviet embassies throughout the world and petitioned leaders in Washington and at the United Nations in New York.         In 1982 she was one of three human rights advocates who delivered a symbolic writ of habeas corpus to officials at the Soviet Embassy in Washington on behalf of Andrei Sakharov, the Soviet dissident and nuclear physicist then living in exile in central European Russia.         Sister Ann, who was born in Texas City, entered the Society of the Holy Child Jesus in 1940 and took her final vows in 1948. She studied at Fordham University and at the Regina Mundi Pontifical Institute in Rome, and received a master's degree in history from Villanova University.         She taught at several of the order's high schools around the country in the 1940's and 50's. She was dean of studies at Rosemont College from 1962 to 1964, and taught theology and scripture at Rosemont from 1964 to 1969.         Sister Ann was also executive director of the National Coalition of American Nuns in the 1970's and served several terms on the governing board of Common Cause, the public-affairs lobbying organization.       
         Pearl Rainwater Twyne, an animal rights advocate in the Washington area who helped draw national attention to the plight of the Tennessee Walking Horse, died last Friday in St. Alphonsus Hospital in Boise, Idaho. Mrs. Twyne, a longtime resident of Great Falls, Va., moved to Boise in 1993. She was 90.         Over the years, horses became her special concern. She led demonstrations against the exhibition of Tennessee Walking Horses, which were trained to prance in an exaggerated, high-stepping gait, sometimes through the use of caustic chemicals or heavy chains.         In 1964, when she attended the Carolina Walking Horse Celebration in Raleigh, N.C., with a veterinarian, a lawyer and two police officers to look for evidence of mistreatment, she was threatened by spectators and forced to flee.         Eventually, testimony by Mrs. Twyne and others before Congress led to the Horse Protection Act of 1970, a Federal law that bars abusive training techniques.         Mrs. Twyne was transformed from a lover of animals to an animal rights activist in the early 1940's when she called the authorities in her town to tend to a stray dog that had collapsed near her house on a hot summer day. When an attendant arrived, he threw the dog in the trunk of his car, slammed it shut and drove away.         Appalled, she and a few friends founded the Arlington Animal Welfare League in 1944.
