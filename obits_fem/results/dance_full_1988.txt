La Meri, the dancer, teacher, writer and dance ethnologist, died in a San Antonio hospital on Jan. 7. She was 89 years old.         Described as ''the indisputed queen of ethnic dance'' by Walter Sorrell, the dance writer, La Meri was long considered the leading American authority on the subject, particularly the dance of India and Spain. She toured the world at the height of her career, in the 1920's and 30's, studying and performing in South and Central America, Europe, Scandinavia, Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Tasmania, India, Burma, Malaya, Java, the Philippines, China, Japan, Ceylon and Hawaii.         She founded the School of Natya with Ruth St. Denis in 1940 in New York, where she taught and performed with her company, the Five Natyas, and presented such guest lecturers as Pearl S. Buck, Coomaraswamy, Lin Yutang, Ted Shawn and Argentinita. Her book ''Spanish Dancing,'' published in 1948, was considered by many to be the definitive text on Spanish dance.         La Meri, whose real name was Russell Meriwether Hughes, was born in Louisville, Ky. She received her first dance training in San Antonio, where she studied ballet and Spanish and Mexican dance as a child. She later studied Hawaiian dancing in Hawaii and, in New York City, modern dance with Michio Ito and ballet with Aaron Tomaroff and Ivan Tarasoff. Dancing Before Movies         La Meri made her professional stage debut in 1924 in San Antonio, where she danced prologues to silent movies. In New York, she performed with Maria Montero and was a featured vaudeville performer with Keith Time and in the 1949 Broadway revue ''A Night in Spain.'' Her first major work was ''Krishna Gopala,'' presented in 1940 with St. Denis and Hadassah as guest artists. She also created an interpretation of ''Swan Lake'' in the Bharata Natyam school of Indian classical dance and created many dances in the styles of other cultures. ''An afternoon with Miss La Meri is rather like being shown a small corner of some connoisseur's collection of choreographiana,'' John Martin wrote in The New York Times in 1940 in a review of one of La Meri's many New York appearances.         She taught and performed with her own company at the New York School of Natya, which was absorbed into the Ethnologic Dance Center she founded in 1942. The school continued until 1956 and was an important source of training in ethnic dancing. La Meri taught at universities across the nation. She also taught and performed at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival and taught at the Juilliard School in New York. On her retirement in 1970, La Meri established Ethnic Dance Arts Inc. in Hyannis, Mass., where she presented an annual ethnic dance festival and awards.         La Meri wrote six volumes of poetry and five books on dance esthetics, technique and composition. Her extensive collection of material on ethnic dance, given to the New York Public Library in 1948 and 1962, is a major holding of the library's Dance Collection. In 1972, La Meri received the Capezio Award.       
        Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year. Known for her dramatic power, Ms. Kaye, who was born in New York City in 1920, was a member of American Ballet Theater from its inception in 1940 until 1951, and again from 1954 to 1959.         Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year. Known for her dramatic power, Ms. Kaye, who was born in New York City in 1920, was a member of American Ballet Theater from its inception in 1940 until 1951, and again from 1954 to 1959. In between, she appeared with the New York City Ballet. Celebrated for her interpretations of the psychological ballets of Antony Tudor, she also danced in works by Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins.         The memorial included speeches by two ballerinas: Alicia Alonso, the Cuban dancer who was part of American Ballet Theater from 1940 until 1955, and Dame Margot Fonteyn, the former star of England's Royal Ballet. ''In her dance,'' Ms. Alonso said of Ms. Kaye, ''there was life always.'' Dame Margot called Ms. Kaye ''the most wonderful friend - understanding, perceptive, encouraging.''         Mr. Robbins analyzed Ms. Kaye's dramatic gift, saying that he believed she was theatrically striking not because she was flamboyant, but because of her gestural economy. Mr. Robbins recalled how last summer, while sitting at a cafe in Spoleto, Italy, he fancied he saw Ms. Kaye pass by.         Other tributes came from Leo Lerman, the theatrical writer; Mike Nichols, the director, and John Taras, Ballet Theater's associate director. Several speakers recalled how Ms. Kaye assisted her second husband, Herbert Ross, the choreographer and director, in his theatrical and film projects. Musical Tributes, as Well         Ms. Kaye had been married first to the violinist Isaac Stern. Mr. Stern was present to play Mozart's Violin Sonata in E minor, with Leonard Bernstein as pianist. Other musical selections included songs by Bernadette Peters and Barbara Cook. Leslie Browne and Robert Hill, of Ballet Theater, offered an excerpt from Tudor's ''Leaves Are Fading.''         The afternoon's touching conclusion came when Lynn Seymour, a British ballerina whose intensity has been likened to that of Ms. Kaye, danced Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan.'' When she stepped forward scattering rose petals, she could have been offering a floral tribute to Ms. Kaye.         Then, with Mr. Bernstein at the piano, Stephanie Friede sang ''Im Abendrot,'' one of Richard Strauss's ''Four Last Songs,'' which accompanied Tudor's ''Hail and Farewell,'' his last ballet for Ms. Kaye. It had been given its premiere by the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1959, with Ms. Kaye as guest artist; she retired in 1961. Possessing a theme that symbolized death and transfiguration, ''Im Abendrot'' sounded especially eloquent.       
        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until the time of her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting women of her time. Mystery in Sculpture         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev, Russia, in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in Russia until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest.         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Isaac Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise Nevelson was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland, Me., asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she was married to Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. A Variety of Influences         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left.         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him that she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture As Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious internal surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.

But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left. Such was her compulsion to work hard and move on that she seemed to be reliving in microcosm the trauma of enforced migration that was endured by hundreds of thousands of European refugees in the 1930's and was shortly to be experienced by even greater numbers of people.         Mrs. Nevelson felt such things in her whole body, as a great dancer feels them; and with her well-developed sense of theater and her first-hand experience of the film studio, where whole environments are no sooner built than they are dismantled, she gradually felt her way toward the work for which she eventually became famous. Celine Was a Suitor         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism.

''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture As Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious internal surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.       
        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known artists, died Sunday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known artists, died Sunday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting people of her time. Known for Wall Sculptures         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev in the Ukraine in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in the Ukraine until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest. A Feeling For Wood         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Mr. Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she married Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. Constant Change, Constant Work         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left. Such was her compulsion to work hard and move on that she seemed to be reliving in microcosm the trauma of enforced migration that was endured by hundreds of thousands of European refugees in the 1930's, and shortly to be experienced by even greater numbers of people.         Mrs. Nevelson felt such things in her whole body, as a great dancer feels them; and with her well-developed sense of theater and her first-hand experience of the film studio, where whole environments are no sooner built than they are dismantled, she gradually felt her way toward the work for which she eventually became famous. Celine Was a Suitor         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she later said of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built an Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work.

Lillian Shapero Rauch, a member of the first Martha Graham Dance Company, died on Tuesday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 years old and had had a stroke.         Born in New York City, Mrs. Rauch, who performed as Lillian Shapero, trained in dance with Michio Ito and Louis Horst. She joined the Graham company in 1929. During her six years with the company, she performed in many Graham classics, among them ''Heretic'' and ''Primitive Mysteries.'' Miss Graham used Miss Shapero as her stand-in while choreographing the latter dance.         Mrs. Rauch worked as a choreographer with the Maurice Schwartz Art Theater from 1932 to 1952. She also created dances for the Lillian Shapero Dance Group from 1936 to 1939. Her last choreography was for a 1982 television production of ''Higher Than Heaven,'' a folk cantata composed by Maurice Rauch, her husband, and based on a story by Itche Goldberg.         Mrs. Rauch was known for adaptations of modern-dance technique for Yiddish theater and for her teaching, which included dance for actors at the New School for Social Research, and modern dance in New York City high schools.         Mrs. Rauch is survived by her husband; a son, Paul, and two granddaughters.       
        Janice Groman, a former member of the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater who later founded a chamber dance company, died at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx on Friday after a long illness. She was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Janice Groman, a former member of the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater who later founded a chamber dance company, died at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx on Friday after a long illness. She was 51 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Groman was born in New Britain, Conn., where she studied ballet with Lillian Sjovall before moving to New York at the age of 11 to study at the Professional Children's School and at the American Ballet Theater School. She danced a wide variety of corps and solo roles in the City Ballet through the 1950's and then became a soloist in Ballet Theater in the early 1960's.         Miss Groman left a few years later to join the First Chamber Dance Quartet, a small troupe that been formed in 1961 by two dancers she had known in the City Ballet, Lois Bewley and William Carter. After that troupe disbanded in 1969, Miss Groman and Charles Bennett, a member of the first troupe, formed the First Chamber Dance Company. Original Choreography         Like the Quartet, the First Chamber Dance Company made its mark by touring extensively and presenting original choreography. Miss Groman and Mr. Bennett were joined by Michael Uthoff, Lisa Bradley and Marjorie Mussman, all former Joffrey Ballet members. Unlike the Quartet, which concentrated on ballets by its own members, the second group also drew from outside choreographers.         In recent years, Miss Groman headed the Groman Dance and Exercise School in New York.         She is survived by her father, Walter E., of New Britain; and three brothers, Walter J., of Toronto, John E., of Dedham, Mass., and Dr. David B., of Prince Edward Island, Canada.       
        Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson.

Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson. She was 88 years old and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.         Known to the dance world, including hundreds of students, as Geordie Graham, she was also the director of the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance from the 1940's through the 1960's. In the 1930's, she married Winthrop Sargeant, who became the music and dance critic of The New Yorker magazine. They were divorced in the 1940's and Miss Graham devoted herself full-time to her administative duties at the school.         The youngest of the three Graham sisters who were born in Allegheny, Pa., and who moved to Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1908, Georgia followed Martha Graham into the Denishawn school in Los Angeles during World War I. Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, considered among the founders of the modern-dance movement, enlisted the teaching talents of both Graham sisters before they recognized them as performers. A Star With Denishawn Troupe         Mr. Shawn nonetheless made Martha Graham a star in his Aztec ballet, ''Xochitl,'' only to see her leave the company in 1922. Georgia Graham, however, danced with the Denishawn Dancers until 1928, sometimes performing in the roles created by Miss St. Denis or her sister. The latter included ''Revolutionary Etude'' and the title role in 'Xochitl.'' According to a fellow Denishawn dancer, Jane Sherman, Georgia Graham stopped the show in that production.         She was a senior member of the Denishawn company on its widespread tour of Asia in 1925-26 and its transcontinental American tour in 1926-27. She also toured with the Denishawn troupe when it became part of the Ziegfeld Follies in 1928. Miss Graham was a dancer in 1931 in the early, all-female Martha Graham Dance Group. In 1933, she appeared in a theatrical production directed by Martha Graham, ''Six Miracle Plays.''         She is survived by her sister.

Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's leading hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her home. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Cafritz gave elegant and lavish parties from the end of World War II until the early 1970s, when failing health curtailed her social schedule.         Her husband, Morris Cafritz, a millionare Washington real estate developer and businessman, died in 1964. After his death, she became president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, which gave about $6 million a year to local organizations devoted to the arts, community service, health and education.         The Cafritz party guests ranged from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who once danced on a transparent dance floor lighted from below, to Supreme Court justices. President Harry Truman, however, favored Mrs. Cafritz's competitor, Perle Mesta.         Mrs. Cafritz, born in Budapest, Hungary, moved to Washington in the 1920's. In June 1986 she gave her last large party, which was described as a ''trip back into Washington social history.''         In 1969, four masked men broke into her mansion, bound and gagged Mrs. Cafritz and others, and escaped with more than $1 million in furs and jewelry.

Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.         Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.         Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.         She gave dozens of parties every year in her 57-room, white brick mansion on a seven-acre hilltop that included a basement night club with illuminated dance floor, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool. Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, Ambassadors, movie stars, Supreme Court Justices and heads of state played happily there over four administrations.         Born in Budapest, Mrs. Cafritz was the daughter of a Hungarian father and an American mother. She was a graduate of the University of Budapest. In the 1920's the family moved to Washington.         She met her husband in 1928 and they were married the next year. He died in 1964. In the early 1970's Mrs. Cafritz was forced to withdraw from the social scene because of poor health.         Surviving are three sons, Calvin, Carter and Conrad, all of Washington, and 13 grandchildren.
