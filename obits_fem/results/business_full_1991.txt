         Antoinette Rampinelli Sole, an interior designer, died on Saturday at a convalescent center in Holmdel, N.J. She was 87 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said her sister-in-law Irene Ramp of Matawan, N.J.         Mrs. Sole was in business with her late husband, George J. Sole, an architect who designed the Roman Catholic Church of the Holy Family in Manhattan. In their work, he did the overall designs and she carried out the interior plans for office buildings, churches and private homes. Mr. Sole died in 1973. Mrs. Sole retired in the mid-1970's.         She is survived by three brothers, Joseph Ramp of Matawan, Roy Rampinelli of Brooklyn and John Ramp of Coram, L.I.       
         Charlene Victor, the executive director of BACA, the Brooklyn Arts Council, died on Monday at her home in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. She was 71 years old.         She died of respiratory failure, the council's public relations director, Chuck Reichenthal, said.         In 1966, Ms. Victor founded BACA, a community-based cultural organization, as an outgrowth of her work with the Prospect Park Centennial Committee. BACA has sponsored many arts events in Brooklyn.         Ms. Victor was born in Chicago and moved to New York when she was 16 to pursue a careeer in the theater. Using the stage name Charlene Harris, she appeared in several Broadway shows, and performed on radio and television. She worked with Orson Welles and the Mercury Theater, and with Imogene Coca, Bob Fosse and Mel Brooks. She retired from the theater in the late 1940's and married Eugene Victor, a Brooklyn politician.         She received awards for her work in the arts from several organizations, including the New York Board of Trade and the Arts and Business Council. In 1987, she was awarded the New York State Governor's Art Award.         She is survived by two sons, Adam and Damon, of New York; a brother, Melvyn Harris of Chicago; a sister, Betty Zamore of Ventura, Calif., and three grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Stockstrom McMillen Brown, a leading interior designer and founder of McMillen Inc. one of this country's best-known design concerns, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100 years old.         Considered a pioneer in her field, she built her reputation on her ability to combine great style with a keen sense of business. Mrs. Brown went to both business and secretarial school after having studied design for three years at the Parsons School in New York and Paris. "I thought if I was going to do it at all, I'd better do it professionally," she once said. "That's why it's McMillen Inc. and not Eleanor McMillen. I wasn't one of the 'ladies.' "         Instead of working from her living room, as so many decorators have done when starting out, she took $13,000 of her own money and opened an office in a town house on East 55th Street.  'Strong-Minded Vision'         "Mrs. Brown was a great Victorian lady with amazing taste yet she had a clear, strong-minded vision," said Mark Hampton, the New York interior designer who worked for her for five years. "She knew how to keep other talented decorators working under the McMillen name."         Over the years her clients included H. H. Rogers of Standard Oil, Arthur Houghton of Corning Glass, Mr. and Mrs. Marshall Field, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Ford 2d, Ambassador and Mrs. Kenneth Franzheim and Mrs. Charles W. Englehard Jr., Mr. and Mrs. Douglas Dillon, Mr. and Mrs. Winthrop Aldrich and Mr. and Mrs. William S. Paley.         In 1963 she was selected to decorate portions of Blair House, the Federal Government's Washington guest house for foreign dignitaries. In the Johnson Administration, McMillen Inc. also decorated the President's private quarters in the White House. In 1952, Mrs. Brown was made a Chevalier of the Legion d'Honneur by the French Government.         Mrs. Brown was born Eleanor Stockstrom in St. Louis. Her father, Louis Stockstrom, founded the American Stove Company. At 24, she married Drury McMillen, an engineer. They traveled extensively for 10 years and were later divorced.         In 1934 she married the architect Archibald M. Brown.         Between marriages, while she was at the Parsons School, she became close to two people who taught there: the antiques expert William Odom, who first taught her to appreciate fine French furniture and was known as her silent partner, and the designer Grace Fakes whose flair for architectural detail was to account for much of Mrs. Brown's reputation.  Valued Parsons Training         So greatly did she value the school's training that she served on its board and for 40 years hired only Parsons graduates.         She also had a reputation as a genius at furniture arrangements. "Mrs. Brown had that uncanny ability to look at a room and instantly tell exactly how to place the furniture and objects so everything just worked," said Stanley Barrows, the former head of the department of interior design at The Fashion Institute of Technology.         She also had a talent for creating a look that was at once restrained and elegant. French furniture carefully mixed with modern pieces was one of her signatures. "Her earliest work could best be described as stripped-down Directoire," Mr. Barrows said.         "Later on she was one of the first decorators to take Italian 18th-century furniture seriously," he said. "It was a reaction to all the gloomy Italian Renaissance pieces that had been so popular."         One person who remembers her style particularly well is the decorator Sister Parish. When Mrs. Parish married at age 19 and had been decorating for all of a year, Mrs. Parish's mother gave the newlyweds a small house on Gracie Square. "It had been decorated from top to bottom by Mrs. Brown," Mrs. Parish recalls. "I never forgave my mother."         Nonetheless, Mrs. Parish said, she still has antiques Mrs. Brown bought for her.         Mrs. Brown went to her office every day until she was 85. "She came in regularly for five years after that," said Betty Sherrill, president of McMillen.         For about 60 years she lived in a duplex apartment on East 57th Street that barely changed since she first decorated it. She once said, "If you get it right the first time there's no need for change." And indeed, Mrs. Brown lived by her beliefs. Every 20 years or so pieces of furniture were reupholstered and the walls given a fresh coat of paint, but always in the same shade of pale yellow.         Mrs. Brown is survived by a son, Louis A. McMillen of Concord, Mass., three grandsons and two great-grandchildren. A memorial service will be held at 11 A.M on Feb. 11 at St. James Episcopal Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         LuEsther T. Mertz, a general partner in Publishers Clearing House who was known for her extensive philanthropy on behalf of the arts and other causes, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, L.I. She was 85 years old and lived in Port Washington, L.I.         She had had several strokes in recent weeks, said her lawyer, William B. O'Connor.         Mrs. Mertz became a general partner in Publishers Clearing House, the magazine-subscription business, soon after its founding in 1953 by her husband, Harold E. Mertz, and their daughter, Joyce Mertz Gilmore. She and her husband were later divorced.         She was the chairman of Joseph Papp's New York Shakespeare Festival from 1973 to 1987 and underwrote moving several of its productions from the Public Theater to Broadway, including "Two Gentlemen of Verona" and "A Chorus Line."         Recalling her support for the arts and her interest in social justice, Mr. Papp said that despite her wealth, "there was nothing in her that suggested anyone was different from anyone else." He described her as high-spirited but said she "never wanted to be in the spotlight."         Mrs. Mertz, a longtime supporter of dance, was on the board of the Original Ballets Foundation, which operates the Feld Ballets/NY and the New Ballet School. She also supported the New York City Ballet. The Joyce Theater on Eighth Avenue at 19th Street, which opened in 1982 and is devoted to dance, is named in memory of her daughter, who died of cancer in 1974. Literature on Tape         In 1961 she founded Choice Magazine Listening in Port Washington for people who are unable to read regular print. The organization selects articles, fiction and poetry from contemporary periodicals, records them on cassette tapes and distributes the tapes free. To endow the organization, she set up a private foundation, the Lucerna Fund.         The LuEsther T. Mertz Retinal Research Center at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital is named for Mrs. Mertz.         She was a major contributor to many New York City cultural and educational institutions, including Lincoln Center and the New York Botanical Garden, and received the Mayor's Award for Arts and Culture in 1983 and the New York State Governor's Arts Award in 1986.         In recent years, she was chairman of the Joyce Mertz Gilmore Foundation, which supports nonprofit activities in human rights, world security and the environment and New York City cultural and civic programs.         She was a trustee of the Port Washington Public Library and a founding member of the Port Washington League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Mertz, whose maiden name was Turner, was born in Cincinnati and grew up in Williamsport, Pa. She graduated from Syracuse University in 1927 with a degree in library science.         Her son, Peter, died in an accident in 1954. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Helen Watson Buckner, a philanthropist, died yesterday at her home in Gulfstream, Fla. She was 73 years old and also had residences in Manhattan and on Fishers Island, N.Y.         Mrs. Buckner died after a stroke, a family spokesman said.         She spent most of her life as a volunteer and financial benefactor. She was a member of the Salvation Army's advisory board; vice chairwoman of the board of managers of the New York Botanical Garden; a trustee of the Brick Presbyterian Church; a board member of the Young Women's Christian Association, and a member of the national Y.W.C.A.'s World Service Council.         She is survived by two sons, Thomas, of Manhattan, and Walker Jr., of Boston; two daughters, Mary Shea of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Elizabeth, of Manhattan; a brother, Thomas J. Watson Jr., the former chief executive of the International Business Machines Corporation, and 12 grandchildren.       
         Anne Walsh Poggi, a former vice president of Dun & Bradstreet, died on Wednesday at Emerson Hospital in Concord, Mass. She was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of emphysema, her granddaughter, Jennifer Anne Sur said.         At the time of her retirement in 1971, Mrs. Poggi was vice president of the business education division of Dun & Bradstreet, in New York City. During her 38 years with the financial services firm, Mrs. Poggi had been assistant director and manager of the public relations and advertising departments and served as editor of the corporation's magazine, Dun's Bulletin.         Born in Chicago, she studied nursing before coming to New York City in the early 1930's. She joined Dun & Bradstreet in 1933 as a clerk.         Active in several women's and professional organizations, she was a former president of the Zonta Club of New York and a member of the Ladies of Charity of New York. She also headed various committees for the Advertising Women of New York.         She is survived by a daughter, Catherine A. Sur of Concord; two sisters, Veronica Lucas and Cathleen O'Hare, both of New York City; a brother, Owen Walsh of Maryknoll, N.Y., and two grandchildren.

         Elizabeth Blume Silverstein, one of the first women to practice law in New Jersey, died on Sunday at New York University Hospital in Manhattan. She was 98 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure, said her son, Nathan Royce Silverstein, a lawyer who lives in Manhattan.         A 1911 graduate of the New Jersey Law School, now Rutgers Uniersity School of Law, Mrs. Silverstein was admitted to the bar in 1913 and soon after opened her own office in Newark. She maintained the office until the mid-1980's when she gradually retired. She was one of the first women in New Jersey to try a criminal case before a jury and to handle a homicide defense alone.         She was an expert on criminal law and was admitted to practice before the United States Supreme Court in 1922. She served as vice president of the Woman Lawyers Association, the Business Women's League and the Commercial Law League of America. She was a delegate to the 1932 Republican National Convention, and in the 1930's served on the executive board of the American Jewish Congress.         Together with her late husband, Max Silverstein, and the late Rabbi Stephen Wise, she helped found the World Jewish Congress, which first met in Geneva in 1936.         Besides her son, she is survived by a sister, Blanche Blum of Miami Beach, Fla.       
         Dr. Margaret K. Chandler, the first female professor at the Graduate School of Business at Columbia University, died on Monday at the Somerset Medical Center in Somerville, N.J. She was 68 years old and lived in Piscataway.         Dr. Chandler died of cancer, a Columbia spokesman said.         She joined the Columbia Business School as a member of the management of organizations faculty, specializing in conflict resolution and collective bargaining. She was the first woman to do so; today there are 22 women on the faculty, five of whom are adjunct professors.         Dr. Chandler had been a member of the labor panel of the American Arbitration Association since 1965. In 1976 she was appointed to the Governor of New York's panel for arbitration of educational disputes and, in 1977, she was named to the special panel of interest arbitrators for police and fire negotiations in New Jersey.         She was a 1944 graduate of the University of Chicago, where she also received a master's degree and a Ph.D. From 1947 to 1965 she was a professor at the University of Illinois.         She is survived by her husband, Louis Chandler, retired professor of nuclear physics at Rutgers University.       
         Shirley Goodman, a driving force behind the Fashion Institute of Technology in New York for more than four decades, died on Sunday at her Manhattan apartment.         She was 75 years old and had had cancer for many years, a spokeswoman at the institute said.         "If there is a single person whose vision and guidance have been most influential in shaping F.I.T., that person is Shirley Goodman," Marvin Feldman, the president of the institute, said.         Ms. Goodman worked tirelessly for the institute, cajoling designers and editors into lecturing, talking manufacturers into opening their showrooms to students and persuading corporations to donate money.         At her death, she was the institute's executive vice president emeritus and executive director of the Educational Foundation for the Fashion Industries, a fund-raising and advisory group for the college, which has been a part of the State University of New York since 1951.         Since her arrival at the fashion institute in 1949, it has grown from two floors of borrowed space in a nearby high school to an eight-building complex on West 27th Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues. Ms. Goodman is credited with leading the expansion from a small trade school to a specialized college offering 24 majors in fashion design, art, business and technology. The college's graduates include Calvin Klein, Norma Kamali, John Anthony and Stephen Burrows.  Building Named for Her         "I didn't start F.I.T., but I helped build it and broaden it," Ms. Goodman said in an interview in 1978. In recognition of her contributions, the college in 1975 dedicated one of its buildings as the Shirley Goodman Resource Center. It houses a library, galleries, a graduate center and a design laboratory with one of the country's largest collections of fashion costumes and textiles.         Throughout her career, Ms. Goodman worked in community and government organizations promoting the fashion industry. She was an honorary professor of the Bunka College of Fashion in Tokyo. She was also director of liaison for the fashion industries at the American National Exhibition in Moscow in 1959 and 1967, executive director of Fashion Capital of the World Inc. from 1973 to 1974, and a trustee of the Coty Awards. In 1975, the Fifth Avenue Association named her Woman of the Year and in 1976, Business Week magazine listed her as one of the 100 top corporate women in the United States.         She joined the fashion institute in 1949 to help draft the legislation making the five-year-old college part of the State University system. She expected to stay there six months, she later said, but never left.         Born in Virginia and reared in North Carolina, Ms. Goodman always retained a trace of a gentle Southern accent that seemed to temper her toughness as a business woman and a fund-raiser. People in the fashion industry described her as "a dynamo" and "a woman of simple dignity and pride." Despite several bouts with cancer, she refused to retire, saying: "When you retire you get old and tired. You don't stay vital."         She is survived by her husband, Himan Brown, a radio and television producer; two sons from a previous marriage, Alan Fishman of New York and Barry Fishman of San Rafael, Calif., and a grandson. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be held at 5 P.M. May 20 at the institute's Haft Auditorium.       
         Natalie Donay, an advertising and cosmetics executive, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 63 years old.         Ms. Donay died of cancer, a spokeswoman for the family said.         She began her career as an advertising copywriter for McCann Erickson, a Manhattan-based advertising agency. In the early 1950's she became advertising director of Charles of the Ritz.         Ms. Donay was responsible for discovering Vidal Sassoon, the hairdresser, in London and brought him and his geometric style to the United States in the mid-1960's. In 1964 Charles of the Ritz merged with Lanvin and she became creative director for both companies, now part of the Revlon Group.         In 1971 Ms. Donay rejoined McCann Erickson and moved to London, where she founded the London Fashion Group. She later retired to start an antique business in London.         A native New Yorker, she was a graduate of the University of Wisconsin.         Ms. Donay is survived by her husband, Donald Goddard, a writer.       
         Geraldine N. Moon, vice chairwoman of the New Jersey Democratic State Committee, died at her home in Camden County on Wednesday. She was 57 years old.         Mrs. Moon died of cancer, said her husband, Hampden.         At her death, she was serving a second two-year term as first vice chairwoman of the committee. Mrs. Moon was also a member of the Democratic National Committee. She was a political associate of Gov. Jim Florio, who is also from Camden County.         She was Winslow Township's deputy tax assessor from 1974 until June 1990, when illness forced a leave of absence.         Mrs. Moon was also the founder of the Camden County chapter of the National Political Congress of Black Women. She graduated from Pierce Business School in Philadelphia and attended Rutgers University in Camden.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by six sisters and two brothers.       
         Dame Peggy Ashcroft, an actress who was in the forefront of British theater for more than half a century, died yesterday in London. She was 83 years old.         She suffered a stroke on May 23 and was unconscious in the Royal Free Hospital since then, a spokeswoman for the hospital said.         Dame Peggy was in the Old Vic company in the early 1930's, frequently appearing with John Gielgud in the 1930's and 40's. She often performed in the West End of London in the 1950's and with the Royal Court, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1956 and in 1962 she became the first British actress to have a theater -- the Ashcroft, in her hometown, Croydon -- named after her in her lifetime.         When she was in her mid-70's Dame Peggy won her greatest international acclaim from roles involving two visits to India. She played a saintly, enigmatic Englishwoman in David Lean's film of E. M. Forster's novel "A Passage to India" and then was cast as a doubting former missionary in a television mini-series, "The Jewel in the Crown," based on Paul Scott's "Raj Quartet."         She won a 1984 Academy Award as best supporting actress for the film; the New York Film Critics Circle voted her best actress. The two performances brought her Britain's top film and television awards. She had previously won a string of awards as the finest actress on the British stage, and in April she won a special Laurence Olivier Award, London's major theatrical prize, for lifetime achievement in the theater. A Juliet to Remember         Dame Peggy was praised as a natural actress who projected an inner serenity and moral gravity. She illumined all of Shakespeare's young leading women and was hailed as the finest Juliet of her generation, artfully attuning her performances to Gielgud and Olivier versions of Romeo and Mercutio as the actors alternated in the roles throughout a season.         Detractors called some of her early performances too genteel and cool, too English bourgeois, but over the decades she displayed increasing versatility in plays by Shaw, Sheridan, Chekhov, Wilde and Ibsen. With uncommon ease she worked closely with new generations of theater people and in later years played Shakespearean matrons and roles created by Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, Harold Pinter and Beckett.         Her talents included portraying the rejected, the lonely and the oppressed with unsentimental sympathy. As Winnie in Beckett's "Happy Days," she was required to spend the first half of the performance buried up to her waist, the second half to her neck. It's "the greatest part ever written," she said, "nearer to Everywoman than any other I can think of, and like climbing Everest to perform."         In approaching hundreds of roles, including 10 leads in a season at the Old Vic, she tirelessly sought psychological truths. "Acting," she said in 1985, "is a mysterious business, so complicated, so tender a subject, there are no rules, and I think one works instinctively."  'Shimmering Radiance'         Defining her art in "Peggy Ashcroft," a 1988 biography, the critic Michael Billington cited her ear for language, her emotional identification with characters and avoidance of vulgarity and affectation.         Sir John Gielgud spoke of the actress's "shimmering radiance and a kind of forthright, trusting quality." The director Peter Hall said she maintained in old age an "extraordinary immediacy and passionate naivete." Harold Pinter said, "This flame of life she possesses informs all she does."         Dame Peggy appeared in only a few movies. Her most memorable early one was a vignette in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 thriller, "The 39 Steps," as a farmer's wife who bravely aids the hero (Robert Donat).         In making films she missed the theater's long, searching rehearsals. The problem with films, she said, "is that you have to imagine everything in sufficient detail before you begin."         "With the theater," she added, "there is time to try things out. With filming, it is hit or miss."         She said appearing in films was "instant acting" because a film actor might have to begin at the end of a scene or a movie and not be able to build a role. "Also, you're in the hands of a director and an editor who can cut and shape, and you have no idea how," she said. "And, of course, there's no sharing with an audience, no rapport."         Dame Peggy said she had no desire to retire. "Just a rest after the rather full years I had in India," she said in 1985. "Then I'll wait and see what television or film or the theater bring."         She cherished privacy and granted few interviews, once explaining gently, "I'm not interested in myself, very." But she was outspoken in protesting injustices and inhumaneness, at home or abroad. She criticized apartheid in South Africa and protested the sentencing of a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky, and political arrests in Czechoslovakia.         Edith Margaret Emily Ashcroft was born on Dec. 22, 1907, in Croydon, a London suburb, to William Worsley Ashcroft, an estate appraiser, and the former Violetta Maud Bernheim. Her father was killed in World War I when she was 10 and her mother died when she was 18, leaving her elder brother, Edward, as her only close relative.         She studied at the Woodford School in Croydon and after discovering "it was very exciting to become someone else," she said, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Her varied roles included Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello in 1930, stardom as Juliet and Shakespeare's other golden girls, as she called them, and title roles in Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," John Drinkwater's "Mary Stuart" and Arthur Schnitzler's "Fraulein Elsa."         A 1989 biography of Paul Robeson by Martin Bauml Duberman revealed that Dame Peggy and the actor had had an affair during the run of "Othello," and quoted her as saying, "How could one not fall in love in such a situation with such a man?"         Later roles included an alcoholic mother in "Edward, My Son," in both London and New York; an unloved spinster in "The Heiress," leading parts in Brecht's "Good Woman of Setzuan," Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and "Rosmersholm" and the 10-hour tour de force as Margaret of Anjou in the Royal Shakespeare Company's "Wars of the Roses."         Dame Peggy was married and divorced three times. She is survived by two children, Nicholas, a director, and Eliza, by her third husband, Jeremy Hutchinson, a lawyer. Her previous husbands were Rupert Hart-Davis, a publisher, and Theodore Komisarjevsky, a director.       
         Concetta Cornacchia Roy, a former high school teacher and administrator in New York City who founded the Council of Supervisors and Administrators, died on Friday at the Long Island Jewish Hospital in Queens. She was 84 years old and lived in Queens Village.         She died of Hodgkin's disease, a spokesman for the family said.         Mrs. Roy began her career as a business teacher at Girls High in Brooklyn. In 1955, when she was a teacher at Flushing High School in Queens, she was elected president of the High School Teachers Association, where she sought to improve working condition for city high school teachers.         In 1964, she founded the Council of Supervisors and Administrators of the New York City public school system, a union group. She also founded the Retired School Supervisors and Administrators in 1971, the year she retired.         She is survived by her husband, Leo, a retired high school teacher, and a sister, Esther Giordiano of Floral Park, Queens.       
         Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter who was married to the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, died on Sunday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 72 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of heart failure after suffering from lymphoma, a family spokesman said.         For the last 40 years, she had worked for charitable causes, including the Girl Scouts, the Endowment Fund of Mount Vernon and the Abigail Adams Smith Museum in Manhattan.         In 1946, she became a reporter at The Washington Times-Herald, now defunct. She wrote a sociey column, "Under My Hat," and later wrote a syndicated column, "From the Capital." She was also a commentator for the Columbia Broadcasting System.         She and William Randolph Hearst Jr., chairman of the Hearst Corporation, were married in 1948. Her first marriage, to Igor Cassini, the designer, ended in divorce.         Mrs. Hearst, who left the newspaper business in 1956, wrote "The Horses of San Simeon," (San Simeon Press, 1985), a book about breeding and raising horses.         She was a graduate of the College of Notre Dame of Maryland in Baltimore.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sons, William Randolph Hearst 3d, publisher of The San Francisco Examiner, and Austin, of Manhattan, vice president of Hearst Entertainment and Syndication, a division of the Hearst Corporation, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.         Correction:  June 25, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary yesterday about Austine McDonnell Hearst, a former reporter whose husband is the editor in chief of the Hearst newspapers, misstated the occupation of her first husband, Igor Cassini. He was a newspaper columnist. (Oleg Cassini, the designer, is Igor Cassini's brother.)       
         Sylvia F. Porter, the author and newspaper columnist who gained wide readership by making business and financial news easy for the general public to understand, died on Wednesday at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y. She was 77 years old.         She died of complications from emphysema, her husband, James Fox, said.         Miss Porter, who wrote more than a score of books on investment, taxes and other economic subjects, also reached 40 million readers through her column on personal finance. It was syndicated by The Los Angeles Times and carried five days a week by 450 newspapers around the world.         From the mid-1930's, when her column began appearing regularly in The New York Post, Miss Porter specialized in reporting events of the financial and business worlds in terms that translated what she called their "bafflegab." Her arrival on the economic scene came at a propitious time: the public was slowly recovering from deep disillusionment with a Wall Street community that many blamed for plunging the country into the Great Depression.         In 1978 she moved her column from The Post to The Daily News, where it continued under the title "Your Money."  Molded by 1929 Market Crash         Miss Porter was born into a Russian-Jewish family in Patchogue, L.I., on June 18, 1913. Her father was a physician, and her mother became a successful milliner. She grew up in Brooklyn and was a freshman at Hunter College who intended to major in English literature and history when the stock market crashed in 1929.         Her mother had invested $30,000 in the bull market of the late 1920's and lost it all. The daughter rethought her career goals and plunged into the study of economics. She earned a Phi Beta Kappa key at Hunter and graduated magna cum laude in 1932, the same year that she and Reed F. Porter, a bank employee, were married.         She went to work for a small investment counseling firm in Wall Street and gained firsthand knowledge of the stock and bond markets, currency fluctuations, business cycles and other financial basics. She also took graduate courses at the New York University School of Business Administration.         She began writing in specialized financial journals, using the byline S. F. Porter to conceal the fact that she was a woman in a field then dominated by men. In 1934 she wrote a weekly column in The American Banker on United States Government securities and soon started her own information service on Government bonds. A Crusader Role Adopted         In 1935 Miss Porter began an occasional column in The New York Post on financial news. In a matter of months she was a regular writer on Wall Street for the paper, and in 1936 she was appointed financial editor. She wrote a daily column that was published under the title "S. F. Porter Says."         Miss Porter became a crusader against what she perceived as economic injustice. She bluntly criticized Government officials for their fiscal policies, at one point asking in an article in The American Banker whether the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau Jr., had been guily of "obstinacy, stupidity or sheer ill advice" in managing Government bonds.         Mr. Morgenthau, like many other figures in the economic world, was unaware that S. F. Porter was a woman. When he did find out, and when officials acknowledged that many of her barbs were justified, he sent her a bouquet of roses.         Other Washington figures were not so forgiving. When she attacked Senator Edwin Johnson of Colorado for his advocacy of silver, he called her "the biggest liar in the United States." Author of Many Books         In 1939 she wrote the first of her many successful books, "How to Make Money in Government Bonds." The book combined her inside knowledge with a popular style, making her information useful to professionals and at the same time accessible to the public.         In her second book, "If War Comes to the American Home," published in 1941 on the eve of America's entry into World War II, she drew on the experience of World War I to tell families how they might be affected in a war economy.         A reviewer in The New York Times summed up her approach this way: "Facts, figures, broad word-pictures and succinct arguments are all presented with conversational ease."         Although her books were published under her full name and she had been heard on radio, it was not until 1942 that The Post changed the title of her column to "Sylvia F. Porter." The newspaper's acknowledgement of her sex brought prominence on the lecture circuit and requests for articles from women's magazines and periodicals of general circulation.         Her column was syndicated, beginning in 1947, and she collaborated with the tax specialist J. K. Lasser on financial handbooks for taxpayers, as well as with other specialists on parallel projects in various economic fields.  Posthumous Book Planned         In 1975 she published "Sylvia Porter's Money Book: How to Earn It, Spend It, Save It, Invest It, Borrow It and Use It to Better Your Life." It sold more than a million copies. Her most recent book, "Sylvia Porter's Your Finances in the 1990's," appeared last year, and her last book, "Planning Your Retirement," is to be published in September.         Not all Miss Porter's ventures were successful. In 1984 she started a magazine, Sylvia Porter's Personal Finance, which rapidly became the third largest periodical in its field, behind Time Inc.'s Money and the Kiplinger organization's Changing Times. But the stock-market plunge in 1987 dealt her publication a lethal blow, and in 1989 its list of 400,000 subscribers was bought by Kiplinger.         Miss Porter's second husband, G. Sumner Collins, died in 1977. Besides Mr. Fox, a public-relations counsel, she is survived by a daughter, Chris Del Cuore of Norway, Me.; a stepson, Sumner Collins of Medical Lake, Wash.; a brother, Dr. John L. Feldman, a physician of Palos Verdes, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Bessie Goldman, co-founder of Farmland Dairies Inc. in Wallington, N.J., died yesterday at her home in Fairlawn, N.J. She was 95 years old.         She came to this country from Russia with her husband, Max, in 1915. The couple founded Fairlawn Dairies Inc., which in 1970 was renamed Farmland Dairies of Wallington and is one of the largest privately owned dairies in the country.         Starting with 20 cows milked by hand, the business grew to employ 350 people and include a fleet of 300 trucks, processing more than a million gallons of milk a week and selling the milk and other dairy products and juices to supermarkets and small stores from Maine to Virginia.         In 1987, after a five-year legal challenge by Farmland, a ruling by a Federal District Court judge opened the New York City market to the company, upsetting a 50-year domination by a powerful group of distributors.         Mrs. Goldman retired in 1955. Her husband died in 1962.         Mrs. Goldman is survived by a son, Jacob, of Glen Rock, N.J.; two daughters, Ethel Weiner of Elmwood Park, N.J., and Margaret Stager of Paterson, N.J.; 16 grandchildren, and 19 great-grandchildren.       
         Katherine Byrne Mast, one of the first female sugar brokers in New York City, died on Wednesday in a nursing home in Devon, Pa. She was 84 years old and lived in Naples, Fla.         Mrs. Mast died of Parkinson's disease, said her nephew, John Ferguson of Greenwich, Conn.         During the early 1930's, she worked in the Manhattan office of W. H. Edgar and Son, sugar brokers of Detroit. She remained with the company until her marriage some 20 years later.         After her husband's death in 1964, she took over his business, Dutton, Mast & Company, a textile concern in Manhattan. The company was later sold.         From 1969 to 1986, when she retired, Mrs. Mast was president of Aug Millang, realtors in Manhasset, L.I.         She was a gradute of All Saints Academy in Harlem and of Trinity College in Washington.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Nell Donnelly Reed, a pioneer in women's ready-to-wear clothing in the 1920's and 1930's, died Sunday morning at her home in Kansas City, Mo. She was 102 years old.         In 1916, Mrs. Reed began making and selling ruffled dresses to replace the drab, cotton house dresses of the period. By the 1940's her clothing company was described as the largest of its kind in the world.         Mrs. Reed said her frilly designs under the Nelly Don label helped challenge conventional thinking of pre-World War I America that it was impossible to give style to clothing in the cheap price range. Her first dresses sold for $1, considerably more than the average price of 69 cents. Savvy in Business         Mrs. Reed was described by Fortune Magazine in 1935 as possibly the most successful businesswoman in the United States. She was considered one who was ahead of her time, being among the first business leaders in her city to offer paid group hospitalization for employees and an unlimited number of tuition-paid night courses and scholarships for their children at local colleges, according to The Kansas City Star.         Through her business, the Donnelly Garment Company, a $3.5 million business with 1,000 employees in 1935, she helped turn Kansas City into a thriving ready-to-wear manufacturing center. Her first husband, Paul Donnelly, a representative for a Kansas City shoe company, acted as the head of the garment company in its early days, but she assumed full control when they were divorced in 1932.         In 1931 Mrs. Reed was the subject of national headlines when she and her chauffeur were kidnapped at gunpoint outside her home and held for ransom. The $75,000 ransom went unpaid and the two were released unharmed 32 hours later. Two men received life terms for their part in the abduction.         The prosecutor in the kidnapping case was James A. Reed, a former United States Senator and former Mayor of Kansas City, whom she would later marry. Mr. Reed, who served three terms in the United States Senate, from 1911 to 1929, died in 1944.  Company Name Changed         The 12th of 13 children, Mrs. Reed was born Ellen Quinlan on March 6, 1889, and grew up in Parsons, Kan., where her family had moved from County Cork, Ireland. At age 16, she married Mr. Donnelly and moved with him to Kansas City.         She said she began adding frills to house dresses so she could "make women look pretty when they are washing dishes," she once said.         The rapid growth of her company in the 1930's brought efforts by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union to organize her plant, but despite legal maneuvers that reached the United States Supreme Court, her company was still union free in 1948.         Mrs. Reed retired from her company in 1956 and it changed its name to Nelly Don Inc. The company went public in 1958, but eventually filed for bankruptcy.         After her retirement, Mrs. Reed continued her involvement in business and civic affairs in Kansas City, serving on the school board and boards of numerous social and cultural institutions, including the Kansas City Art Institute and the Midwest Research Institute.         She is survived by a son, David, and four grandchildren.

         Ann C. Whitman, an influential figure in the White House as the personal secretary to President Dwight D. Eisenhower and later as chief of staff to Vice President Nelson A. Rockefeller, died Tuesday at Morton Plant Hospital in Clearwater, Fla. She was 83 years old and lived in Clearwater.         Mrs. Whitman died of heart failure, friends said.         "There's no question she played a vital role in the Eisenhower Administration; he really depended on her tremendously," said Robert J. Donovan, author of "Confidential Secretary: Ann Whitman's 20 Years with Eisenhower and Rockefeller" (E. P. Dutton, 1988).         Mrs. Whitman routinely worked 12 hours a day, and often seven days a week. Among her chores was supervising the President's responses to correspondence, which reached hundreds of thousands of letters a year. Recruited in 1952         Mrs. Whitman, whose maiden name was Cook, was born in Perry, Ohio, and attended Antioch College. As part of its work-study program, she went to the Institute for Child Guidance in New York City, became a secretary there and never returned to college. Her next job, which she held for 16 years, was as a personal secretary to Adele Rosenwald Levy, whose father was a founder of Sears, Roebuck & Company.         In the early 1950's Mrs. Whitman worked for the Committee for a Free Europe, which ran Radio Free Europe. She was then recruited for the Eisenhower Presidential campaign in 1952, and worked for Eisenhower through both of his Administrations.         In 1961 she worked for George Hinman, a political adviser to Rockefeller when he was Governor of New York, and became the Governor's executive assistant in 1965. In 1974, when President Gerald R. Ford named Rockefeller as Vice President, she served as his chief of staff. She retired in 1977.         Mrs. Whitman married Clarence Willard Moore in 1933, but the marriage ended in divorce. In 1940 she married Edmund Whitman, her first husband's business colleague at the United Fruit Company. That marriage also ended in divorce, in 1961.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Gladys Krieble Delmas, a philanthropist and writer who gave more than $20 million to cultural and educational institutions, died on Wednesday at Beth Israel Medical Center.         Mrs. Delmas, who was 78 years old and lived in Manhattan, died of heart failure, her lawyer said.         Over more than two decades, she contributed more than $4 million to the New York Public Library. Gifts from Mrs. Delmas, a trustee of the library, allowed it to reopen evenings after the fiscal crisis in the 1970's compelled it to curtail hours. Last spring, a gift of $1 million enabled the library to remain open five days a week instead of four.         Mrs. Delmas was also a significant contributor to the New York City Ballet and to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, N.J.         Her fortune was based mainly on the family business started by her father, Vernon K. Krieble. The business, the Loctite Corporation, a manufacturer of glue used in industry, became a multimillion-dollar concern and the Kriebles were sometimes called the Rockefellers of the glue business.         She grew up in Hartford, graduated from Vassar and in 1937, married Jean Paul Delmas. The couple lived in Europe and Latin America for 25 years. During her years abroad, Mrs. Delmas worked as a radio journalist, reporting for French National Radio and Radio Canada. Mr. Delmas died in 1988.         She is survived by her brother, Robert H. Krieble of Old Lyme, Conn.; a niece, Helen K. Fusscas of Marlborough, Conn., and a nephew, Frederick B. Krieble, who lives abroad.       
         Jean Wade Rindlaub, one of the first American women to become a major advertising executive, died on Thursday at the Courtland Garden Health Center in Stamford, Conn. She was 87 years old and lived in Stamford. She died of complications from a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Rindlaub, in 34 years at the Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn agency in Manhattan, rose to head of a copy group and in 1946 became a vice president, the first woman at that level in the company. In 1954, she became the first woman on the company board. The American Advertising Federation named her woman of the year in 1951 and in 1989 elected her to its hall of fame.         Recognizing the growing importance of homemakers and working women, Mrs. Rindlaub organized nearly 400 women at the agency into sounding boards for products and marketing. As forerunners of marketing-research focus groups, they offered ideas and reactions for products, brand names, packaging and advertising.         Mrs. Rindlaub, born in Lancaster, Pa., was from a Pennsylvania Dutch family. As a teen-ager, she taught typing and shorthand at her father's business school and worked for Armstrong Cork as a secretary to the advertising manager. She became editor of company publications.         She joined B. B. D.&O. in 1930 as a copywriter and supervised campaigns for United Fruit, General Mills and Campbell's Soup. Her slogan for Oneida silverware, "Back home for keeps," resonated as a wartime theme in the 40's. Her work appeared in two compilations, "100 Top Copywriters and Their Favorite Ads" and "100 Greatest Advertisements."         She was a vice chairwoman of the National Safety Council, wrote a newsletter column for the National Council of Women, was a director of the Advertising Women of New York and the Fashion Group and was an adviser to the Tobe-Coburn School for Fashion Careers.         Appointed under Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller to the New York State Council of Women, she was the principal author of a report, "New York Women and Their Changing World." She participated in White House Conferences on Nutrition held by Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Richard M. Nixon and was a delegate to a White House Conference on Aging.         For 50 years she lived in Teaneck, N.J., where she was a co-founder of the Senior Services Center and was chairwoman of the Friendship House, the Advisory Board on Senior Citizens and the Advisory Board on Community Relations. She was citizen of the year in 1981. In Stamford she volunteered as a teacher's assistant.         Her husband, Willard, died in 1983. Surviving are a son, John, of Riverside, Conn.; a daughter, Anne Dow of Cambridge, Mass.; five grandchildren, and six great-grandchildren.       
         Sarah Nederlander, the matriarch of the Nederlander theatrical family, died Dec. 19 at her home in Southfield, Mich. She was 97 years old.         Mrs. Nederlander, who was born Sarah Applebaum, married David T. Nederlander in 1916. Together they built the Nederlander Organization, which operates a chain of theaters and other entertainment enterprises. Mr. Nederlander died in 1967, and she continued to work for the business.         She is survived by a daughter, Frances Kohn, of Shaker Heights, Ohio, and five sons: James M., of New York, who is the current chairman of the Nederlander Organization; Robert, also of New York, who is the organization's president; Harry, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich.; Fred, of Franklin, Mich., and Joseph, of Birmingham, Mich.       
         Greta Kempton, a painter whose portrait of President Harry S. Truman hangs in the White House, died on Monday at her home in New York City. She was 89 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Daisy Dickson of Norfolk, Va.         Miss Kempton, who was born in Vienna, started painting life-size portraits while still a child. She studied art in Vienna and, after her family moved to the United States in the early 1920's, at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League in New York City. By the mid-1930's, she was living in California and was well-established as a painter of commissioned portraits, with Hollywood studio heads like Louis B. Mayer and Adolf Zukor among her clients.         In the 1940's she painted portraits of several members of the Truman Administration and their families, which led to commissions for portraits of the President, his wife and daughter.         Miss Kempton's husband, A. M. McNamara, a lawyer and business executive, died several years ago.
